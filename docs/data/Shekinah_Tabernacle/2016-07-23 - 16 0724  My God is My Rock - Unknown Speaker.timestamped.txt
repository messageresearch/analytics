[48:25] today amen
[48:27] um we just got one announcement um we
[48:30] got brother Daniel fryo preaching on
[48:33] Wednesday now probably everyone says
[48:35] well so that's a brother he so he
[48:37] ministers out of brother Ron Peterson's
[48:39] Church in Arizona and he's in the
[48:41] country you know you know sister chth
[48:43] mounter that's that's that's her dad
[48:46] they're in the country and they're just
[48:47] down here for a couple of days and
[48:48] they're here on a Wednesday so if you
[48:49] can make it I'd i' I'd be here amen he's
[48:53] very good Ministry very mature Ministry
[48:55] you know so we'll be blessed amen amen
[48:57] and so yeah so that's this Wednesday
[49:00] um yeah amen so that's the on the um
[49:03] announcement um if you'd like to take
[49:05] your Bibles and turn with me to Genesis
[49:08] chapter 1 and then we'll go to Isaiah
[49:09] chapter 9 and I just want to say that
[49:12] you know uh so I came home last night
[49:15] after preparing and Christine says
[49:16] Isaac's going to sing this song and I
[49:19] say
[49:20] basically my my whole sermon was in that
[49:23] song Amen but I had no idea he was going
[49:25] to sing it God has a mind you you know
[49:27] you know let's not like you know you
[49:28] take like brother brother John in the
[49:30] pray meeting on Wednesday sing in the
[49:32] spirit a song came out that he never not
[49:34] even conscious what he sng you know and
[49:37] sometimes we just sit there and these
[49:38] things just pass Us by don't let it pass
[49:40] you by God did something in our midst am
[49:43] amen and we don't want to take it just
[49:44] for granted
[49:46] amen amen so Isaiah I mean sorry Genesis
[49:50] 1: 26-
[49:53] 28 and God said let us make make man in
[49:57] our image after our likeness and let him
[49:59] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[50:01] and over the fowl of the air and over
[50:02] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[50:04] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[50:06] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[50:08] own image in the image of God created he
[50:10] him male and female created he them and
[50:13] God blessed them and God said unto them
[50:15] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[50:18] the Earth and subdue it and have
[50:20] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[50:22] over the fowl of the air and over every
[50:24] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[50:28] and then let's go to Isaiah chapter 9 so
[50:32] notice have dominion subdue it amen have
[50:36] dominion over it subdue subdue the
[50:40] creation um and then Isiah chapter
[50:51] 9 is 9 6 and 7
[50:56] he says this for unto us a child is born
[51:00] unto us a son is given and the
[51:02] government shall be upon his shoulder
[51:05] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[51:07] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[51:09] father the Prince of Peace of the
[51:11] increase of his government and peace uh
[51:13] there shall be no end upon the throne of
[51:15] David and upon his kingdom to order it
[51:18] to establish it with judgment and with
[51:20] Justice from henceforth even forever the
[51:22] Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform
[51:25] this amen m Lord bless his word you may
[51:27] you may be
[51:32] seated I was also yeah um there's also
[51:35] another announcement I forgot so a
[51:37] couple of months ago uh Christine went
[51:40] to the
[51:41] doctor and um we were praying about what
[51:43] we should do because we were very time
[51:45] poor you know me working full-time and
[51:48] she was driving to the doctor she said
[51:50] Lord may we get an answer from the
[51:52] doctor she goes to a doctor that she's
[51:54] never it's not a normal doctor
[51:57] and um so you know basically you the
[52:00] doctor said well you're you know you
[52:02] know you're stressed you're tired you
[52:04] know and then and then um and then and
[52:06] then the doctor said to her well he said
[52:08] if you don't change what you're doing
[52:10] she said now forgive me if I get this
[52:11] wrong Christine's really the details
[52:13] person but she said the doctor basically
[52:15] said if you don't change what you're
[52:17] doing in 10 years you won't be here and
[52:19] then this doctor said what is your
[52:20] husband do so describe me never met me
[52:23] before I didn't even know who this
[52:24] doctor is and she said said if he
[52:26] doesn't change what he does he's not
[52:28] going to be here in 10 years either he
[52:30] said what you should do is he should
[52:31] quit his job finish his job focus and
[52:34] then focus on the
[52:37] ministry and then let Christine go back
[52:39] and she said you need to go back and do
[52:41] your Healthcare assistant job because
[52:42] you love doing that and then whatever
[52:44] whatever doesn't make the uh and then
[52:47] let the church make up what what what
[52:49] doesn't come in
[52:52] okay no maybe I should let you tell the
[52:55] testimony sorry but but that's kind of
[52:57] the gist of it I
[52:59] dear that's basically the gist of
[53:02] it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yes if
[53:04] Christin do the shifts to to make up the
[53:06] Gap that the church can't provide yeah
[53:09] yeah IA I didn't tell of the situation
[53:12] yeah so yeah so she didn't say this is
[53:14] what we're going through this is what
[53:14] we're doing so la Friday was my last day
[53:18] but I'm on a casual contract I'm going
[53:20] back on Tuesday but now I'm only working
[53:22] like a couple of days a week maybe okay
[53:26] and Christine is casual at the at the
[53:29] hospital now this is that because the
[53:32] intent that I am here in Wellington is
[53:34] not to work full-time at a job but I'm
[53:37] happy to work you must understand I'm
[53:38] not doing this cuz I'm lazy but the
[53:40] focus is the work of the Lorden yeah
[53:44] praise God amen amen I'm sorry honey
[53:47] beer maybe I should have got you to say
[53:48] it but you know so I'm so we're a lot
[53:50] more flexible okay so we're we're more
[53:53] available okay amen that's why I want to
[53:56] be for for everyone amen yeah
[54:00] so
[54:01] yeah Christine she knows the testimony
[54:04] but but that's basically the gist of it
[54:05] the Lord okay so here we
[54:08] are so um and basically it's NE because
[54:11] I'm on a casual uh wage I can basically
[54:13] earn the same I would in 8 hours and 6
[54:15] hours so I just I was working 6 hours
[54:18] Tuesday and Friday Lord anyway so so
[54:21] that's that's what's happening that's
[54:23] what's happened cuz we because you can't
[54:25] do you can't get a different result if
[54:27] you keep doing the same thing amen
[54:29] insanity is doing the same thing
[54:31] expecting something different yes amen
[54:34] amen amen right so you got to change
[54:36] things that's
[54:38] right
[54:40] now so we read there in Genesis chapter
[54:42] one that God uh that man was given
[54:44] dominion over the face of the Earth over
[54:47] everything and he was commanded to
[54:49] subdue it be fruitful multiply replenish
[54:53] the Earth subdue it have dominion over
[54:55] the fish of the Sea of the the foul of
[54:56] the air and over every living thing that
[54:58] moveth upon the Earth so have dominion
[55:01] so man was called to to subdue the
[55:04] creation have dominion over it and now
[55:07] we read there in Isaiah chapter 9 that
[55:09] you know a very very familiar scripture
[55:11] that For unto us a child is born unto us
[55:13] a son is given and the government shall
[55:15] be upon his shoulder and his name Shall
[55:17] be Called wonderful counsel of the
[55:18] Mighty God the Everlasting father the
[55:20] Prince of Peace of the increase of his
[55:22] government and peace there shall be no
[55:24] end upon the throne of David and upon
[55:27] his kingdom to order it to establish it
[55:29] with judgment and with Justice from
[55:31] henceforth even forever and the Zeal of
[55:34] the Lord of hosts will perform us so
[55:36] speaking of now the son that is given
[55:38] who is we know is our Lord Jesus Christ
[55:41] that his his his government will
[55:44] increase I mean his kingdom will expand
[55:46] amen and this word son in the Old
[55:49] Testament the word son is actually it
[55:52] means a builder of the family name amen
[55:55] a build of the family name this is what
[55:57] it means in the Hebrew and then of
[56:00] course it also means in the in in the
[56:02] widest sense of literal and
[56:05] figurative a relationship which is
[56:07] including a son a grandson a subject a
[56:09] nation or something but the main meaning
[56:11] of a son is the Builder of a family
[56:13] name and you know and and the primary
[56:18] primary root meaning of that in the
[56:19] Hebrew is to build so a son is meant to
[56:22] build the family name or to build the
[56:24] kingdom
[56:26] and but we understand that you know God
[56:30] God has to build us on something I'm
[56:33] just going to yeah let's just go to
[56:35] Matthew chapter
[56:37] 16 forgive me if this goes a little bit
[56:39] slow in the beginning
[56:41] but want you understand that
[56:44] we we are not built on shifting
[56:46] Sands we are not built on man's ideas or
[56:50] man's opinion or popular opinion of the
[56:52] day or theology or culture or what the
[56:54] church thinks or what someone else think
[56:56] things but we're built on thus sayth the
[56:58] Lord me we're built upon the revelation
[57:00] of who of who Jesus is in his season and
[57:03] I want you to see this in in Matthew 16
[57:05] remember Jesus Jesus was to build the
[57:09] family name he's the builder of the
[57:11] family name so when God came in flesh
[57:14] his his purpose was to expand his
[57:17] Dominion upon the Earth to take Dominion
[57:20] back from Satan of creation and not just
[57:23] take creation under his Dominion but to
[57:25] gather sub
[57:26] to be built into the family of God am
[57:29] mean cuz he's a builder and a builder he
[57:31] constructs things he what is what is on
[57:33] a blueprint becomes material when he's
[57:36] finished amen amen so God has a
[57:38] blueprint of his word amen we know that
[57:41] the works of God will finish from the
[57:42] foundation of the world so even the New
[57:45] Testament it was already done and so God
[57:47] had a blueprint and he was going to
[57:49] build his people rebuild his people
[57:52] according to the blueprint of his word
[57:54] amen but he needs a builder to do the
[57:55] building am cuz there's no good having
[57:57] the material and having the section and
[58:00] having the legal document that you can
[58:02] build without a builder amen because if
[58:05] you don't have that guy with the hammer
[58:06] and the expertise and the knowledge your
[58:08] building is not going very
[58:11] far
[58:12] amen now Matthew 16 and
[58:15] verse3 I know this is very familiar but
[58:18] I just want to read it when Jesus came
[58:20] into the coast of cesia Philippi he
[58:23] asked his disciples saying whom do men
[58:26] say that I the son of man am and they
[58:28] said some say thou art John the Baptist
[58:31] some Elias and others Jeremiah so one of
[58:34] the prophets he saith unto them but whom
[58:38] say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[58:41] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[58:43] the son of the Living God and Jesus
[58:45] answered and said unto him blessed art
[58:47] thou Simon by Jonah which is Simon son
[58:49] of Jonah for flesh and blood is not
[58:52] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[58:54] which is in heaven
[58:56] and I say also unto thee that thou art
[58:59] Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my
[59:02] church I will build my church and the
[59:04] Gates of Hell bdon me shall not Prevail
[59:07] against it and I will give unto thee the
[59:10] Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[59:12] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[59:14] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[59:17] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be
[59:19] loosed in heaven so we understand that
[59:22] this this this piece of scripture here
[59:25] that Jesus is not you know the whole
[59:29] conversation is on Revelation he asks he
[59:32] he says who do men say that I am so what
[59:34] has been revealed to everyone that I am
[59:37] remember Jesus looked like anyone else
[59:39] he wasn't like the cartoon Bible stories
[59:42] where he six foot blonde hair Pure White
[59:45] robe you know looks very different
[59:46] everyone around him he looked like
[59:48] everyone else Isaiah 53 said that when
[59:51] we see him there'll be nothing in him
[59:52] that we would desire him so he wasn't
[59:54] even a great handsome fellow amen but in
[59:57] him he was God made flesh and so it so
[1:00:01] he they're asking what has been revealed
[1:00:03] and they was and and the people said
[1:00:06] because they could see what they read
[1:00:08] about the prophets doing they could see
[1:00:09] in the ministry of Jesus Christ because
[1:00:12] because he was the fullness of the
[1:00:13] godhead bodly so what was poured out in
[1:00:16] portion there you know there was a
[1:00:17] lawgiver in Moses and then there's so
[1:00:19] there's a portion of Christ revealed in
[1:00:21] Moses and all the way down through the
[1:00:23] prophets it was it was the part of God
[1:00:26] like if you take a three-sided um you
[1:00:28] know piece of glass you shine light
[1:00:30] through it you get a rainbow and it's
[1:00:32] the same thing the fullness of God in
[1:00:34] bod is reflected you you know refracted
[1:00:36] through the pyramid amen and then and
[1:00:39] then a portion of that light it's all
[1:00:41] split up I mean so all of that was
[1:00:43] gathered and the fullness of that now
[1:00:46] was in Christ amen and that's why they
[1:00:48] say well you seem like Jeremiah or you
[1:00:50] see like you know you seem to be like
[1:00:52] John the Baptist the spirit of Elijah or
[1:00:54] Elias or Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[1:00:56] cuz they could see what the prophets did
[1:00:58] he
[1:00:59] did but then he asked a question but
[1:01:01] whom say ye that I am because he wanted
[1:01:05] them he wanted because you have to
[1:01:07] remember God is looking for a response
[1:01:10] right I mean he's looking for you to
[1:01:12] respond to his word he doesn't want
[1:01:14] someone just to sit there and watch it
[1:01:15] all go by he's wanting you to personally
[1:01:19] speak and reply to him and that's what
[1:01:21] he was getting his disciples because he
[1:01:23] knew he knew Peter would have had the
[1:01:26] had the Revelation Thou Art the Christ
[1:01:28] but he wanted it to come out of his lips
[1:01:30] and that's why he asked a question but
[1:01:32] who do you say that I am and Peter Simon
[1:01:35] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[1:01:37] Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:01:41] Jesus answered and S blessed art thou
[1:01:43] Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath
[1:01:46] not revealed it see it's talking about
[1:01:47] Revelation it's not but my Father which
[1:01:50] is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou
[1:01:52] Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:01:56] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[1:01:58] not Prevail against it so the rock he's
[1:02:00] speaking about is not Peter the man who
[1:02:02] would deny him three times try and kill
[1:02:04] a God the sword you know when pressure
[1:02:05] came down he denied him and all these
[1:02:07] things and it's not even Jesus but the
[1:02:10] river but the rock that the church is
[1:02:12] built upon is the revelation of who
[1:02:14] Jesus Christ is amen that is that is the
[1:02:18] rock amen amen that is the rock but I
[1:02:22] want you to know and it said that the
[1:02:23] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:02:25] it wanted to get to this last Sunday but
[1:02:27] I didn't have the time remember because
[1:02:29] there was a promise given to Abraham and
[1:02:31] a promise given to Rebecca that thy seed
[1:02:34] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[1:02:36] amen amen so so the people that are
[1:02:39] built upon the rock of who Jesus is amen
[1:02:42] they will possess the gates of their
[1:02:43] enemy because the Gates of Hell shall
[1:02:45] not Prevail against them Hallelujah so
[1:02:48] we so the church is built upon who Jesus
[1:02:52] is not who Jesus was that's right amen
[1:02:55] because even the Catholics acknowledge
[1:02:56] he died and rose again even historians
[1:02:59] you go read the histories they
[1:03:01] acknowledge Jesus was alive amen but
[1:03:04] that's just a historical God and we
[1:03:07] understand what good does a historical
[1:03:09] God do to us it doesn't do any good you
[1:03:12] can't get you know your brother BR would
[1:03:14] make the saying you cannot get warm next
[1:03:16] to a painted fire the fire it may be it
[1:03:19] may be more real and you know HD and all
[1:03:23] the whatever high definition picture it
[1:03:25] could ever be
[1:03:26] but you can never get warm next to that
[1:03:28] thing you can never get the effects of
[1:03:30] it if it's just a painted fire and it's
[1:03:33] the same thing with the Bible what good
[1:03:35] is it quoting about a just a historical
[1:03:37] God if he's not the same today what good
[1:03:39] does it do it just makes us a bunch of
[1:03:41] historians we're not historians I mean
[1:03:44] God is not a god of History he's a god
[1:03:46] of the present he said I he you know you
[1:03:49] know when Moses was speaking to him in
[1:03:51] the Burning Bush Moses asked asked this
[1:03:54] one in the pillar of in the burning bush
[1:03:57] tell me what your name is that I can
[1:03:59] tell the Elders of Israel who sent me he
[1:04:01] says I am that I am he's the present God
[1:04:05] and that's why the scripture says he is
[1:04:07] the same yesterday today and forever but
[1:04:11] but the sad thing is man is forever
[1:04:13] thanking God for what he did looking
[1:04:15] forward for what he's going to do and
[1:04:17] missing what he's doing but he he's in
[1:04:19] the Today part we want to know what God
[1:04:21] is where is he today amen amen amen
[1:04:25] that's what we need to know and so the
[1:04:27] question is now and I put this very much
[1:04:29] on your lap who do you say who do you
[1:04:33] say this is amen oh brother brandom
[1:04:37] you're a prophet of God Malachi 4 but
[1:04:40] who do you say when you look in the
[1:04:41] mirror for yourself and you look into
[1:04:44] the word for yourself and you see what
[1:04:46] God is doing Among Us I ask you the
[1:04:48] question who do you say this is amen
[1:04:50] amen who do you say this is because the
[1:04:53] word must put on flesh in every
[1:04:55] generation
[1:04:56] and the word must be pre preached
[1:04:58] through a living vessel it's got to be
[1:05:00] it's got to be lived out of a living
[1:05:01] vessel amen it can't just be historical
[1:05:04] but that same God must live in this
[1:05:06] generation as well and that's why the
[1:05:08] question always comes upon us who do you
[1:05:10] say this is is it is it just a
[1:05:12] personality of a man or a group of
[1:05:15] people that are enthused about some
[1:05:17] Doctrine amen who do you say it is what
[1:05:20] caused brother John to just sing in the
[1:05:22] spirit like that wasn't his own ability
[1:05:24] he says I didn't even know what I sung
[1:05:27] Don't Let It Go by you young people when
[1:05:29] God do you know does things like that
[1:05:31] hallelujah amen cuz we can just go oh he
[1:05:35] practiced that now he sung it no he
[1:05:36] didn't even realize what he was doing
[1:05:39] God took over a man hallelujah amen I
[1:05:42] want to see more of it amen we will amen
[1:05:45] however God wants to manifest himself I
[1:05:47] say God you do it amen whatever you want
[1:05:49] to do amen Hall and so it's the
[1:05:52] revelation of who he is in this season
[1:05:55] amen and and the prophet tells us that
[1:05:57] Christ has put on bride form am mean
[1:06:00] he's veiled behind human skin in this
[1:06:03] generation amen and I trust when you if
[1:06:06] you've met him you're going to say God
[1:06:08] is in me amen remember Jesus said I'll
[1:06:10] be with you even in you until the end of
[1:06:13] the world Amen I'll be with you even in
[1:06:16] you what does that mean if You' have met
[1:06:18] him he's in
[1:06:19] you so you if you had a cross-section of
[1:06:23] your body and you goone to another
[1:06:24] dimension you'd see Pillar of Fire in
[1:06:26] you hallelujah amen you'd see the same
[1:06:28] God that came down that's why he came
[1:06:29] down the day of Pentecost and it's not a
[1:06:32] painted fire to us but he came down that
[1:06:34] logos light came down separated himself
[1:06:36] into 120 people amen amen then the word
[1:06:40] went forth what was happening God was
[1:06:42] expanding his kingdom God was taking out
[1:06:45] this this this world under Dominion amen
[1:06:48] hallelujah he was expanding his kingdom
[1:06:50] and then the word went forth and then
[1:06:52] the kingdom was expanded I mean people
[1:06:54] who are in Chang of of Darkness they saw
[1:06:56] glorious light and they walked free am
[1:07:00] hallelujah amen so it's the Revelation
[1:07:03] sure we must know what God has done yeah
[1:07:07] that's right but you cannot personally
[1:07:09] know a god of
[1:07:10] History amen even studying the science
[1:07:13] of the creation it's a wonderful thing I
[1:07:16] spent a lot of time in University
[1:07:17] studying creation science but it didn't
[1:07:19] help me meet the author of the
[1:07:21] word amen sure it was helpful but it
[1:07:24] didn't help me meet the author but when
[1:07:26] I Heard a Voice on a tape one day amen
[1:07:28] and God Came Upon the scene but I had to
[1:07:31] be willing to give
[1:07:33] myself amen you got to be willing you
[1:07:35] can be convicted all the day long you
[1:07:38] can know you're wrong deep down in your
[1:07:39] soul but unless you're willing to give
[1:07:41] yourself over just give yourself over
[1:07:45] amen amen hallelujah Mery I'm afraid
[1:07:48] what someone will think of me what is
[1:07:50] who do we live before I ask your
[1:07:52] question who do we live before do we
[1:07:54] live before our
[1:07:56] family who's our God I I just want I
[1:07:59] just want to really put it down who's
[1:08:01] our God because the one you make your
[1:08:03] sub yourself subject to ultimately
[1:08:05] that's your God that's right that's the
[1:08:07] god you serve so is it your family or
[1:08:10] your culture or the popular opinion of
[1:08:12] the day right or is it this right amen
[1:08:17] just you just just just just think about
[1:08:19] that oh I love the Lord but what are you
[1:08:21] bowing to amen yeah amen amen God have
[1:08:25] mercy I would bow to this amen amen
[1:08:29] because he's not a mean father he's not
[1:08:31] a cruel Taskmaster he doesn't beat you
[1:08:34] and wear you down and you know he's a
[1:08:36] loving God Amen all I've seen is love
[1:08:39] these last however many years Hallelujah
[1:08:41] all I've seen and it's just got greater
[1:08:44] amen hallelujah yes Lord amen so Upon
[1:08:47] This Rock the spiritual revelation of
[1:08:49] who God is who Jesus is I'm going to
[1:08:53] read this from the Rapture message he
[1:08:55] said bless blessed art thou Simon son of
[1:08:56] Jonas for flesh and blood has not
[1:08:59] revealed this to you my father which is
[1:09:01] in heaven has revealed this to you Upon
[1:09:03] This Rock the spiritual revelation of
[1:09:06] who God is who Jesus is and here is the
[1:09:10] revelation of God God made in flesh and
[1:09:13] revealed to the world he was in the
[1:09:16] world God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:09:18] world to himself revealing what God was
[1:09:21] in a body of Flesh Thou Art Christ the
[1:09:22] anointed one the Son of God he said
[1:09:25] flesh and blood never revealed this to
[1:09:26] you but my Father which is in heaven has
[1:09:29] revealed this to you Upon This Rock I'll
[1:09:31] build my church The revelation of the
[1:09:33] word and its season which is who Jesus
[1:09:35] is I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:09:38] Hell cannot Prevail against it amen amen
[1:09:42] amen now let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:09:44] 7 you know we love
[1:09:47] to maybe we should sing it a lot more
[1:09:49] you know we you you there's a song that
[1:09:51] the wise man built his house upon the
[1:09:53] rock and the rain came down and the
[1:09:55] floods came up and the house stood firm
[1:09:57] amen amen yeah praise the Lord amen but
[1:10:02] let's let's just read thisall because
[1:10:04] it's very interesting when you see you
[1:10:07] see
[1:10:08] what
[1:10:10] uh because there's a reason as as as the
[1:10:13] word is ordered so Jesus he has a
[1:10:16] purpose of going from one Parable to the
[1:10:18] next or one story to the next yeah
[1:10:21] there's a reason why he spoke things in
[1:10:24] a certain order
[1:10:26] yeah and so if we go to Matthew
[1:10:29] 7 and verse
[1:10:32] 21 look at
[1:10:34] this and this is just before the parable
[1:10:37] that we're going to read but there's a
[1:10:38] reason it's
[1:10:39] there not everyone that saith unto me
[1:10:42] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:10:43] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[1:10:46] My Father which is in heaven we know the
[1:10:48] will of the father is the word many will
[1:10:50] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[1:10:52] not prophesied in thy name and thy name
[1:10:55] have cast out devils and in thy name
[1:10:57] done many wonderful
[1:10:59] works then will I profess unto them I
[1:11:02] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:11:04] work iniquity so he he doesn't tell them
[1:11:08] you never did those things yep so these
[1:11:11] are people who are anointed with the
[1:11:13] spirit of God doing miracles in his name
[1:11:16] but yet they are workers of iniquity now
[1:11:18] why is that because a worker of iniquity
[1:11:21] is someone who knows better but is not
[1:11:23] willing to change
[1:11:25] that's what a worker of iniquity is amen
[1:11:28] and I believe that none of us are in
[1:11:29] that
[1:11:30] category
[1:11:32] amen now look so so and then he goes
[1:11:36] from there then he goes there therefore
[1:11:38] whoever heareth these sayings of mine
[1:11:40] and doeth them I will liken him unto a
[1:11:44] wise man which which built his house
[1:11:47] upon a rock let's just say there quickly
[1:11:49] remember a worker of
[1:11:50] iniquity is someone who heareth the
[1:11:54] sayings of mine and doesn't do them yeah
[1:11:58] so now he's making a contrast because
[1:12:00] here's a group of people we just read
[1:12:02] about who will be bitly
[1:12:03] disappointed but the word came their way
[1:12:06] it's like even you read you know you
[1:12:08] know you make it such a simple
[1:12:09] illustration water baptism in the name
[1:12:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ if you take all
[1:12:13] the scriptures of baptism you can see it
[1:12:15] is the Lord Jesus Christ it's very very
[1:12:18] straightforward but yet there's but
[1:12:20] there there's ministers upon the Earth
[1:12:22] that have read those things and heard
[1:12:24] about those things but because they are
[1:12:27] not they're afraid to do go against
[1:12:30] their church and against their
[1:12:31] denomination they will keep quiet about
[1:12:34] it and they'll compromise on the word
[1:12:36] that's right amen so instead of staying
[1:12:39] with the truth because remember if you
[1:12:41] stand for God God will stand for you if
[1:12:44] you do not stand for God God will not
[1:12:47] stand for you he is only obligated to
[1:12:49] his word amen so if you stand upon his
[1:12:52] word he is obligated to you amen right
[1:12:55] you may not understand how the outcome
[1:12:56] works out but he will stand job stood
[1:12:59] upon the word of God in his day hallelu
[1:13:01] remember he he he killed the sacrifice
[1:13:03] for himself and his family and that
[1:13:06] sacrifice was God's provided way in that
[1:13:08] day amen and he didn't understand what
[1:13:11] was going on he didn't he didn't he
[1:13:14] didn't understand why he lost everything
[1:13:16] he's covered in boils head to toe he
[1:13:18] lost his children you know he's on an
[1:13:19] ash he he didn't understand it but he
[1:13:22] was standing upon that sacrifice God
[1:13:25] ordained he was standing upon the word
[1:13:28] and because because he just stayed there
[1:13:31] sure he complained you know he did but
[1:13:34] and he didn't understand what was going
[1:13:35] on but because he stood on that
[1:13:37] sacrifice I put the way he stood on the
[1:13:39] word then God came down and God revealed
[1:13:43] him God revealed himself in that trial
[1:13:46] in a greater way than job ever knew him
[1:13:48] because he said I've heard of thee but
[1:13:50] now I see thee and at the end of that
[1:13:52] trial he says now I know my redeemer
[1:13:54] lives he didn't know his Redeemer lived
[1:13:56] before that he had no idea what the
[1:13:58] resurrection was all about he says you
[1:14:00] see a you know you see a tree the Autumn
[1:14:03] time you know the leaves fall off it's
[1:14:05] it's there with no leaves in the winter
[1:14:07] and then the spring comes forth and the
[1:14:09] life comes back and sees a flower you
[1:14:11] know same thing the flower dies drops
[1:14:13] the seed and then the seed comes up in
[1:14:14] the next you know Springtime and the
[1:14:16] cycle over and over again he sees a man
[1:14:19] he dies where does he go you read about
[1:14:21] the Book of Job he had no idea where it
[1:14:23] was you know you know the her Afters he
[1:14:25] had no idea but through that trial he
[1:14:29] said now I know my redeemer lives and in
[1:14:32] this flesh I'll see God and I'll stand
[1:14:34] with him on that day am hallelujah amen
[1:14:37] why because he stood he stood on the
[1:14:40] word he did not move off what God had
[1:14:42] ordained amen amen and because he stood
[1:14:45] for God God stood for him amen amen and
[1:14:49] that's why job was considered a perfect
[1:14:51] man as he said as God said to Satan
[1:14:53] because he took God and his word and he
[1:14:55] stood upon the word amen amen and it's
[1:14:59] the same thing with you and I remember
[1:15:01] if he didn't yeah if job did not stand
[1:15:03] upon the word I don't believe God would
[1:15:05] have stood for
[1:15:06] him okay brother Braham says job knew he
[1:15:10] wasn't righteous but job knew was
[1:15:14] putting trust in the slain blood of that
[1:15:16] lamb and that's what made him righteous
[1:15:19] so he knew you know job in his own
[1:15:20] ability he knew wasn't righteous yeah
[1:15:23] cuz he said if there's only someone who
[1:15:24] could who could lay hands on a sinful
[1:15:26] man and a holy God and basically
[1:15:28] reconcile them cuz he knew that he
[1:15:30] wasn't you know but he was righteous
[1:15:32] because he had confidence in the blood
[1:15:34] of the Lamb amen amen amen and that's
[1:15:37] why now if you stand for God if you
[1:15:41] remember one with God is a majority amen
[1:15:44] amen one with God is a majority we don't
[1:15:46] trust in the flesh and blood we see
[1:15:48] around us though it's encouraging we put
[1:15:50] our confidence in God oh yes Lord so
[1:15:53] then now therefore whosoever heareth
[1:15:56] these sayings of mine and doeth them
[1:15:58] I'll liken him unto a wise man which
[1:16:00] built his house upon a
[1:16:02] rock and the rain descended and the
[1:16:04] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[1:16:06] upon that house and it fell not for it
[1:16:09] was founded upon a
[1:16:11] rock and everyone that heareth these
[1:16:13] sayings of mine and doeth them not shall
[1:16:16] be likened unto a foolish man which
[1:16:18] built his house upon the sand and the
[1:16:21] rain descended and the floods came and
[1:16:23] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[1:16:26] and it fell and great was the fall of it
[1:16:31] amen this world is falling apart amen
[1:16:35] there's been another shooting in Germany

[1:16:38] become
[1:16:39] common you know people they take their
[1:16:41] weapons they you know they just gun down
[1:16:43] heaps of people few years ago that would
[1:16:46] have been a great jot but now we just
[1:16:49] become numb to it and people in Iraq are
[1:16:51] being butchered and you know all the you
[1:16:53] know Syria and all these terrible things
[1:16:55] going on you know and we can become numb
[1:16:58] to all these things it's become almost
[1:17:00] common it's become everyday event amen
[1:17:04] and the world and you see what's
[1:17:06] happening oh you know people get so
[1:17:08] caught up in the American elections I'll
[1:17:11] say this it doesn't matter who's in the
[1:17:13] office they will fulfill what God has
[1:17:15] ordained them to do amen amen and
[1:17:17] Russia's going to Nuke the pl you know
[1:17:19] he's gonna it's prophesied to happen he
[1:17:22] said in the last version he says I saw
[1:17:25] this brother bam 1933 I saw all of
[1:17:28] America just covered in smoking craters
[1:17:30] amen amen and it's going to happen
[1:17:32] because Russia's coming to her position
[1:17:35] and all of all of the westers playing
[1:17:37] Pokémon go blinded to what's going on I
[1:17:40] saw a headline wasn't even a bunch of
[1:17:41] believers they said that that all of the
[1:17:45] world knows that America is going to be
[1:17:47] in a next major war except America
[1:17:50] because everyone's playing Pokémon go
[1:17:53] all caught up in all these things
[1:17:54] blinded
[1:17:55] to what's going on Amen thank God we're
[1:17:58] not blinded friends because we would be
[1:18:01] in that same position if it wasn't for
[1:18:03] the grace of God Amen it's not him that
[1:18:05] willth or runneth but God that show us
[1:18:07] Mercy hallelujah amen so this world is
[1:18:11] falling apart and it will fall apart it
[1:18:13] has to it's been ordained to fall apart
[1:18:15] that's right amen but those who are
[1:18:17] built upon the rock amen of revelation
[1:18:19] of who Jesus Christ is they will never
[1:18:22] fall Hallelujah the you know the storms
[1:18:24] of life may come that's why it's such a
[1:18:27] victory you see a house that's that
[1:18:29] survived a great flood you know like wow
[1:18:32] how did that Sur you know what a
[1:18:33] tremendous thing it's the same thing
[1:18:35] with a Believer you know we're not fly
[1:18:37] by night people am in one day out the
[1:18:39] next day Come Rain hail fire persecution
[1:18:45] hardship division whatever it may be War
[1:18:49] famine Strife we're standing rugged
[1:18:53] because we're built upon a foundation
[1:18:55] we know in whom we have belied and it's
[1:18:58] not shifting SS of this you know as as
[1:19:01] Peter said we these are not enticing
[1:19:04] words just of man's fables amen this
[1:19:08] message is not just man you know
[1:19:09] enticing words and man's fables and
[1:19:11] things these things really happen amen
[1:19:15] and the evidence of it is you because
[1:19:17] normally you know if you go look at the
[1:19:19] history of denomination there's a move
[1:19:21] of God with the founder yeah but then
[1:19:24] you just just go one two generations
[1:19:26] down the road and all they say is look
[1:19:28] what our founder did amen but you see in
[1:19:32] the see in this though brother said this
[1:19:34] will never denominate that's right and
[1:19:35] you can see that because we're not
[1:19:36] always looking say oh what happened 50
[1:19:39] years ago we're saying look what's
[1:19:40] happening today look what God is doing
[1:19:42] among us today and that's the proof of
[1:19:44] the pudding is that God is the same in
[1:19:46] all generations that we don't we haven't
[1:19:48] just gathered ourselves on a historical
[1:19:50] figure but we've gathered ourselves to a
[1:19:53] living God Amen yes
[1:19:56] amen and so if you're built upon the
[1:19:59] rock amen doesn't matter what Storms
[1:20:02] Come and
[1:20:03] Go you know there's that song you know
[1:20:06] don't build your house on the Sandy land
[1:20:08] don't build it too near the shore you
[1:20:10] know but it says but build your house
[1:20:12] upon the rock a good foundation a solid
[1:20:14] spot the storms may come and go but what
[1:20:17] the peace of God you will
[1:20:18] know and that's exactly
[1:20:21] right
[1:20:22] now if we go to the book of Deuteronomy
[1:20:25] 32 I just want to show you
[1:20:28] that you know
[1:20:31] Moses and it's a few places but I just
[1:20:33] wanted to take a few here where he
[1:20:36] speaks of God being their Rock Amen our
[1:20:40] God is a rock of you know he's a
[1:20:43] rock and so let's go to Deuteronomy 32
[1:20:47] we're just going to skip down through
[1:20:48] this chapter just to save
[1:20:50] time so Deuteronomy 32:15
[1:20:57] say Amen if you're
[1:20:58] there okay verse 15 he can read the
[1:21:01] whole chapter no sorry verse one
[1:21:04] Deuteronomy
[1:21:05] 32:1 give ear O ye heavens and I'll
[1:21:07] speak and hear o Earth the words of my
[1:21:10] mouth my Doctrine shall drop as the rain
[1:21:14] my speech shall distill as the Jew as a
[1:21:16] small rain upon the tender herb and as
[1:21:19] the flow showers upon the grass because
[1:21:21] I will publish the name of the Lord
[1:21:23] ascribe ye greatness unto our God he is
[1:21:26] the rock his work is perfect and all his
[1:21:29] ways are judgment a god of Truth and
[1:21:31] without iniquity just and right as he
[1:21:34] that's go to verse 15 he says but jesam
[1:21:37] which is actually Israel not Israel wax
[1:21:39] fat and kicked Thou Art wax and fat Thou
[1:21:43] Art grown thick Thou Art covered with
[1:21:45] fatness but he forsook God which made
[1:21:48] him and lightly esteemed the rock of his
[1:21:52] salvation and let's just go to down to
[1:21:54] Verse 18 of the rock that begat thee
[1:21:57] Thou Art unmindful and Hast forgotten
[1:22:00] God that formed thee May he's talking
[1:22:03] about this is not a piece of masonry a
[1:22:05] piece of stone he's talking about a
[1:22:06] person
[1:22:08] amen and then he says in verse 30 how
[1:22:12] should one chase a thousand and two put
[1:22:14] 10,000 to flight except their Rock had
[1:22:17] sold them and the Lord had shut them up
[1:22:20] and verse 31 for their Rock is now not
[1:22:23] our Rock even our enemies themselves
[1:22:26] being judges so he's saying that the
[1:22:29] people of Israel their Revelation is not
[1:22:32] our Revelation amen their God is not our
[1:22:35] God you understand so our Rock remember
[1:22:40] our rock is
[1:22:41] firm yeah we are not we may be troubled
[1:22:45] on every side but we don't forget in
[1:22:47] whom we have
[1:22:49] beli amen we may have troubles all the
[1:22:51] day long but we know in whom we have
[1:22:53] believed and we we are built on this
[1:22:55] Foundation this Rock Amen because the
[1:22:59] Gates of Hell how do they Prevail WIS of
[1:23:01] false Doctrine formality just having
[1:23:04] church just just having a church culture
[1:23:07] that's how the Gates of Hell Prevail
[1:23:08] against
[1:23:09] Christendom
[1:23:11] amen but if you're built upon the rock
[1:23:14] those who are built upon the rock they
[1:23:16] want a living God they're not satisfied
[1:23:19] with just what happened yesterday year
[1:23:21] but they want them to live today amen
[1:23:24] amen want more of him yes do you
[1:23:27] not amen and verse 37 and he shall say
[1:23:32] where are their gods their Rock in whom
[1:23:35] they
[1:23:36] trusted yeah and it goes all the way
[1:23:39] through the Bible I just wanted to go
[1:23:40] there
[1:23:42] now a rock this word Rock in the what we
[1:23:46] read here in Deuteronomy in the in the
[1:23:49] Hebrew that means properly a cliff or
[1:23:52] sharp rock as compressed generally a
[1:23:55] rock or Boulder but figuratively a
[1:23:58] refuge yeah and our God is a refuge yeah
[1:24:03] we can take I trust you have I take
[1:24:06] refuge in my rock amen amen because you
[1:24:10] know you know someone that it's been
[1:24:12] revealed to you cannot get them out of
[1:24:15] it by an
[1:24:17] argument amen a revelation becomes part
[1:24:20] of you yeah it becomes very part of your
[1:24:23] being it's not something that's learn
[1:24:24] and your mind changes a revelation you
[1:24:27] cannot deny a
[1:24:28] revelation amen so in times of trouble
[1:24:32] you can go to that as a refuge because
[1:24:35] if God has revealed himself to you in
[1:24:38] the past yes amen if God has made
[1:24:41] himself real to you and he said Upon
[1:24:44] This Rock I'll build my church then you
[1:24:46] can use that as a refuge because instead
[1:24:49] of turning to your own top two inches
[1:24:51] here your brain or people around you
[1:24:53] only you can turn to him amen amen in
[1:24:56] times of trouble you can turn to him
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:00] hallelujah
[1:25:02] now I want
[1:25:05] to and then so David now I want to speak
[1:25:08] of a
[1:25:11] couple he says this
[1:25:15] here this is David in in in second
[1:25:18] Samuel 22
[1:25:26] is everyone with me amen 2 Samuel 22 God
[1:25:29] is our Rock if that's all you get out of
[1:25:31] the service praise the Lord amen you got
[1:25:33] to you got to know in whom you have
[1:25:34] believed and you have to have confidence
[1:25:36] in whom you have believed amen amen
[1:25:39] because remember the training anyone's
[1:25:41] training doesn't matter if it's military
[1:25:43] police paramedic doctors whatever nurses
[1:25:47] that is never put to the test when
[1:25:49] there's nothing going on it's when
[1:25:51] there's a time of Crisis then what has
[1:25:53] been learned absorbed comes out am amen
[1:25:56] you take like the SAS you you the elite
[1:25:59] you know military it's in times of great
[1:26:02] pressure when when it's Split Second
[1:26:04] decisions come but it's a result of
[1:26:05] training they receive amen and it's like
[1:26:09] it's like when when I've never had to do
[1:26:11] military training but you know those
[1:26:14] those those those new recruits they
[1:26:16] begin to hate their sergeant major with
[1:26:18] a passion they hate them because they
[1:26:20] drill you know you know he abuses them
[1:26:22] he shouts them gets them up early makes
[1:26:24] them do all these exercises and they
[1:26:26] hate the guy but then on the battlefield
[1:26:28] they love him because they appreciate
[1:26:31] all the training that went in is
[1:26:32] actually saving their lives and they
[1:26:34] love
[1:26:34] them yeah because it's on the
[1:26:37] battlefield everything that they learned
[1:26:39] now just comes
[1:26:41] out amen so it's the same thing with us
[1:26:45] yeah it's it's it's in the it's not in
[1:26:48] the easy times oh praise the Lord I
[1:26:50] believe the message I'm going in a
[1:26:51] Rapture it's in the hard times that's
[1:26:53] right amen that that that what God has
[1:26:57] has has has put into your soul
[1:27:00] everything of that it comes out in the
[1:27:01] hard
[1:27:02] times amen oh my help us
[1:27:06] godone hey I put myself hey I have hard
[1:27:09] times too we all have hard times we have
[1:27:11] good times we have hard times but the
[1:27:13] important thing is now remember a
[1:27:15] Mountaintop experience is a good time
[1:27:17] take but when you go down you find
[1:27:19] yourself in a valley take the
[1:27:20] Mountaintop experience to the valley
[1:27:23] amen so take the victory that you had
[1:27:25] take and take it down into the trial cuz
[1:27:28] it will help you in the valley but we
[1:27:30] understand that on a mountain top you
[1:27:32] don't grow fruit on a Mountaintop
[1:27:34] Hallelujah it grows in the
[1:27:36] valley amen amen so oh I'm going through
[1:27:38] a real blender of it your real hardship
[1:27:41] time and then you'll come out of it
[1:27:43] you'll say thank you Lord I'm so glad I
[1:27:45] went through that cuz cuz you can see
[1:27:48] what God has done for you how he's
[1:27:50] molded and shaped your your character
[1:27:53] yes Lord
[1:27:55] Hallelujah and character is the only
[1:27:57] thing that you're going to take with you
[1:27:58] by the
[1:27:59] way cuz remember death doesn't change
[1:28:02] you it just changes your Dwelling Place
[1:28:05] remember when when Samuel when Saul went
[1:28:08] to the witch of indor because he
[1:28:09] couldn't hear from God about should they
[1:28:11] fight the Philistines or what shall it
[1:28:13] be he went to that
[1:28:14] witch and then the witch called up
[1:28:16] Samuel he had a mantle upon him and he
[1:28:19] prophesied this time tomorrow or
[1:28:21] something you'll be where I am and in
[1:28:24] other words he prophesied you're going
[1:28:25] to die in battle and he did so here was
[1:28:28] someone called up from the other side
[1:28:29] and he was still
[1:28:30] Samuel amen he was still so death just
[1:28:33] changed his dwelling place that's why if
[1:28:36] you love the Lord here you'll love him
[1:28:37] there amen if people despise him here
[1:28:40] they'll despise him there you know and
[1:28:43] so 2 Samuel 22 and
[1:28:47] verse1 and David spake unto the Lord the
[1:28:50] words of this song in the day that the
[1:28:51] Lord had delivered him out of the hands
[1:28:53] of all his enemies now the hand of Saul
[1:28:56] and he said the Lord is my rock my
[1:28:59] Fortress and my deliverer the god of my
[1:29:02] rock in whom will I trust he is my
[1:29:04] shield and the Horn of my salvation my
[1:29:06] high tower my refuge My Savior thou
[1:29:09] saveth me from violence I will call on
[1:29:12] the Lord who is worthy to be praised so
[1:29:15] shall I be saved from my enemies when
[1:29:17] the waves of death comp pass me the
[1:29:19] floods of the ungodly men made me afraid
[1:29:22] the Sorrows of hell Compass me about the
[1:29:25] snares of death prevented me and my
[1:29:27] distress I called upon the Lord and
[1:29:30] cried to my God and he did hear my voice
[1:29:32] out of his Temple and My Cry did enter
[1:29:35] into his ears now you can read the whole
[1:29:37] chapter but he's describing now he says
[1:29:40] my lord is my rock now I'm going to jump
[1:29:44] back to the very beginning of the
[1:29:45] service and we'll come back to this but
[1:29:47] remember God told man have dominion
[1:29:50] subdue all the Earth Yep and the
[1:29:53] increase of of his government there
[1:29:54] shall be no end Isaiah chapter 9
[1:29:58] so I'm going to take later but I'm going
[1:30:00] to come to this now I'm going to take
[1:30:01] two characters in The Bible I'm going to
[1:30:02] take David I'm going to take Paul both
[1:30:05] of them expanded the borders of the
[1:30:07] Kingdom one was a natural Kingdom David
[1:30:10] the other was a spiritual Kingdom Paul
[1:30:12] right amen so they were fulfilling God's
[1:30:15] Commission in a way to take the Earth
[1:30:17] under Dominion yep but they both so that
[1:30:21] was number one but number two they both
[1:30:24] knew God as their rock yeah now I don't
[1:30:27] remember Paul ever saying that he's his
[1:30:28] Rock but you can see but he was built
[1:30:31] remember Jesus when he's speaking to
[1:30:33] Peter James and John the apostles Upon
[1:30:35] This Rock I'll build my church he had in
[1:30:37] his mind Paul's going to be built Upon
[1:30:38] This Rock because on the road to
[1:30:41] Damascus he sees God come down the great
[1:30:43] light shines upon him and and go and and
[1:30:46] well he was Saul at the time he you know
[1:30:48] he speaks to this being he says who are
[1:30:51] you Lord and the voice speaks back I'm
[1:30:53] Jesus whom thou
[1:30:55] persecuted you know and
[1:30:57] so and so he was built and then what
[1:31:00] happened was whatever came their way
[1:31:02] remember they were like the wise men
[1:31:04] that built their house upon the rock
[1:31:06] because they had storms David had a lot
[1:31:08] of distress he had a lot of hardship he
[1:31:11] was on the run for a long time from Saul
[1:31:14] he had a lot of close close run you know
[1:31:17] scrapes and things where it could have
[1:31:19] gone this way or that way but he had
[1:31:22] confidence that he was was anointed by a
[1:31:25] prophet of God to be king and that was
[1:31:29] his Refuge amen trust me that was his
[1:31:31] Refuge because it anchored in his heart
[1:31:34] I'm going to be king of
[1:31:35] Israel and so what does that mean it
[1:31:38] means exactly what was said to him you
[1:31:40] will be king over this nation over these
[1:31:43] 12 tribes but he was on the Run he was a
[1:31:45] fugitive in his own land you know all
[1:31:47] all kinds of things there's a time when
[1:31:49] he when he had to flee to the land of
[1:31:51] the Philistines and and act crazy in
[1:31:54] front of the king that the king wouldn't
[1:31:55] take his life you know there were there
[1:31:57] were a lot of places like that in his
[1:31:59] life but deep down in his soul he knew
[1:32:02] I'm going to be king and that's why he
[1:32:04] didn't kill Saul the two times he could
[1:32:06] have took taken his life because he knew
[1:32:09] when God was ready and when he was
[1:32:12] prepared then David would be upon the
[1:32:14] throne you understand he had confidence
[1:32:17] that at the right time at the right
[1:32:19] season he would be on the throne and
[1:32:22] that's why he was his Rock
[1:32:24] and it's the same thing with you and I
[1:32:26] friends you just have to have confidence
[1:32:28] at the right time remember the scripture
[1:32:30] even says in the New
[1:32:32] Testament and this is not verbatim but
[1:32:34] it basically says the current state
[1:32:35] you're in take it as the will of God for
[1:32:38] your life
[1:32:39] am that's what it says just be content
[1:32:41] in where you are amen amen because you I
[1:32:45] trust you know I know the rock my God is
[1:32:47] a rock it doesn't matter where I am what
[1:32:50] situation I'm in this is where I meant
[1:32:52] to be am hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:32:55] right amen so if you have that if you
[1:32:57] have that Revelation then it doesn't
[1:32:59] matter like like we'll come to it later
[1:33:01] at the end but Paul says None of these
[1:33:03] things move me a lot of things tried to
[1:33:05] move him a lot of things he said none of
[1:33:08] these things move him amen amen he was a
[1:33:10] little man but but but he could have
[1:33:11] said like David my god Jehovah Jehovah's
[1:33:15] salvation Jesus Jesus means Jehovah
[1:33:17] salvation my God Is My Rock and I shall
[1:33:20] not be moved amen amen hallelujah
[1:33:24] and I say these things because the same
[1:33:25] God back there is the same God today I
[1:33:28] mean you don't just read these stories
[1:33:29] and say oh wouldn't it be neat to be
[1:33:31] like that you got to say I am that
[1:33:32] person I know the same God I'm built on
[1:33:35] the same Rock Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:33:38] that's right and he'd say in the Psalms
[1:33:41] I'm just going to read this quickly
[1:33:42] Psalms
[1:33:43] 8926 he shall cry unto me thou art my
[1:33:46] father my God and the rock of my
[1:33:48] salvation Psalms 92 and5 to show that
[1:33:52] the Lord is upright here's my Rock and
[1:33:54] there is no unrighteousness in him
[1:33:56] Psalms 94 and22 but the Lord is my
[1:33:58] defense and my God is the rock of my
[1:34:00] refuge these are David's words amen so
[1:34:03] he knew he knew exactly amen you know it
[1:34:08] wasn't nice ideas to him God became
[1:34:10] personal to David amen it said when he
[1:34:13] was anointed by Samuel said the spirit
[1:34:14] of God was with him from that day on
[1:34:17] that's right amen and he could always go
[1:34:18] back to that time amen he could always
[1:34:21] go back to that time and I trust you can
[1:34:24] always go back to a time where the
[1:34:26] anointing came up the anointing of the
[1:34:28] word came upon you and you're a
[1:34:30] different person from that day on
[1:34:33] Amen
[1:34:35] now as I said a son I'm just going to
[1:34:39] I'm sorry I'm just going to jump right
[1:34:40] back again a
[1:34:42] son is a builder of the family name yeah
[1:34:46] that's what the Hebrew word means a
[1:34:48] son now Paul would write in Ephesians
[1:34:52] chapter 3
[1:34:54] and maybe let's just go there if you
[1:34:56] don't
[1:35:13] mind now Ephesians chapter
[1:35:19] 3:9 says this here and you can read the
[1:35:22] whole thing but I just want to take
[1:35:24] these
[1:35:25] scriptures he
[1:35:26] says wait let's go from verse eight unto
[1:35:29] me who am less than least of all the
[1:35:32] saints is this Grace given that I should
[1:35:34] preach among the Gentiles The
[1:35:36] unsearchable Riches of Christ and to
[1:35:38] make all men see what is the Fellowship
[1:35:40] of the mystery which was from the
[1:35:42] beginning of the world hath been hidden
[1:35:45] God who created All Things by Jesus
[1:35:47] Christ to the intent that now unto the
[1:35:50] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[1:35:52] places might be be known by the church
[1:35:55] the manifold wisdom of God Amen
[1:35:58] according to the Eternal purpose which
[1:36:01] he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in
[1:36:04] whom we have boldness and access with
[1:36:06] confidence by the faith of him wherefore
[1:36:08] I desire that you faint not at my
[1:36:10] tribulations for you which is your glory
[1:36:14] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[1:36:16] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[1:36:19] the whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[1:36:23] named
[1:36:24] that he would Grant you according to the
[1:36:26] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:36:29] with the might by his spirit in the
[1:36:31] inner man that Christ May dwell in your
[1:36:33] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[1:36:36] grounded in love may be able to
[1:36:39] comprehend with all the saints what is
[1:36:40] the breadth and the length and the depth
[1:36:43] and the height and to know the love of
[1:36:45] Christ which passeth knowledge that you
[1:36:48] might be filled with all the fullness of
[1:36:50] God now unto him that is able to do
[1:36:52] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:36:55] ask or think according to the power that
[1:36:57] worketh in US unto him be glory in the
[1:37:00] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[1:37:02] ages World Without End
[1:37:06] Amen and so
[1:37:08] Paul Paul's Paul's purpose was to build
[1:37:12] the kingdom was for its borders to be
[1:37:15] expanded because he was a builder of the
[1:37:18] family name but it wasn't his name he
[1:37:20] was he was putting forth but the name of
[1:37:22] Jesus Christ amen amen and the whole
[1:37:25] purpose of him of him going on his
[1:37:29] missionary Journeys and things was that
[1:37:31] the kingdom would be expanded that this
[1:37:33] creation would come under Dominion
[1:37:36] again yeah and now in Genesis 1 we read
[1:37:39] it he said to subdue it and have
[1:37:41] dominion over it okay I trust now I
[1:37:45] trust this all comes together to have
[1:37:47] dominion to subdue it and take dominion
[1:37:49] over it now how did God I was want to
[1:37:53] before that how did God bring order out
[1:37:56] of chaos because you're ordained to have
[1:37:59] dominion over this Earth am mean you're
[1:38:02] ordained to subdue it because by God
[1:38:05] telling them in the beginning to have
[1:38:07] dominion over it to subdue it they
[1:38:09] actually told now you what does it mean
[1:38:11] to subdue something you've actually got
[1:38:12] to take a hold of it you've got to put
[1:38:15] it in its place amen you've actually got
[1:38:18] to have dominion over it yeah so he told
[1:38:21] them this is what you have to do
[1:38:25] but now how did that now how God did
[1:38:28] this is how man does this okay so how
[1:38:32] did God bring order out of Chaos in the
[1:38:34] creation by speaking his word he caused
[1:38:38] Eden to come out of Darkness yeah
[1:38:41] remember in the beginning the world was
[1:38:42] out Fullman void Darkness covered the
[1:38:44] face of the deep the spirit of God moved
[1:38:46] upon the face of the waters and God
[1:38:48] began speaking and then at the end there
[1:38:51] was there was the there was Eden there
[1:38:54] was Paradise there was a man and a woman
[1:38:56] in a garden so everything was how it
[1:38:58] should be but it was by him
[1:39:01] speaking order came out of chaos that's
[1:39:04] right yeah and you can see the world I'm
[1:39:06] just going to go jump back to how the
[1:39:07] world's falling apart they're trying to
[1:39:11] they're going to try and bring order out
[1:39:12] of this chaos that's happening amen
[1:39:15] because in order to to to change
[1:39:18] something to change a world order there
[1:39:20] has to be there has to be a revolution
[1:39:22] or chaos to happen and then out of that
[1:39:25] chaos they can bring something new it
[1:39:27] happens everywhere you see the French
[1:39:28] Revolution chaos happened and out of it
[1:39:30] came a
[1:39:31] republic
[1:39:33] amen the you you the king of France
[1:39:35] would never have just said now let's
[1:39:36] have a republic and gone somewhere else
[1:39:39] they had to be chaos and our order came
[1:39:42] out of that
[1:39:43] chaos you can see the whole thing around
[1:39:45] the
[1:39:47] world now so he spoke now and every part
[1:39:52] of creation was subject to God's spoken
[1:39:54] word in the beginning yeah all of nature
[1:39:57] this entire Earth was not one of it
[1:39:59] resisted or stopped what he said that
[1:40:02] would happen he said let there be light
[1:40:04] there was light let the waters divide
[1:40:08] and let dry land come forth all these
[1:40:09] things exactly what happened
[1:40:12] yeah but
[1:40:14] now so man before the fall had dominion
[1:40:19] over the creation by the spoken word
[1:40:22] yeah man man had Dominion because Adam
[1:40:25] was made in the image of God yep so what
[1:40:28] God what Adam did is because God Did It
[1:40:31] Before you following me it's like our
[1:40:33] children you know you know you see
[1:40:35] anyone's kids and you look at the
[1:40:37] parents and say they're just like you
[1:40:39] are they so you know you like you see
[1:40:41] someone who's very gifted in in art or
[1:40:43] music or whatever it is it's normally in
[1:40:45] the parents they're just like you
[1:40:48] because the ability is passed down amen
[1:40:51] yeah that's so OD your son so good at
[1:40:54] sport well look at the parents that's
[1:40:56] normally in them you got a natural
[1:40:58] ability well where' that come from the
[1:41:00] parents yeah so Adam's ability to have
[1:41:04] dominion by the spoken word is because
[1:41:05] his father God had that same ability
[1:41:08] amen y amen now but then when when the
[1:41:13] fall came in Genesis 3:1 17 and this is
[1:41:17] God and he says and unto Adam he said
[1:41:18] because thou has hearkened unto the
[1:41:20] voice of thy wife and have eaten of the
[1:41:22] tree which I Comm commanded thee saying
[1:41:24] Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the
[1:41:26] ground for thy sake and sorrow shall th
[1:41:29] eat of it all the days of thy life
[1:41:32] Thorns also and thistles shall it bring
[1:41:35] forth uh to thee and thou shall eat the
[1:41:38] herb of the field in the sweat of thy
[1:41:40] face shall thou eat bread till thou
[1:41:43] return unto the ground for out of it was
[1:41:46] thou taken for dust Thou Art and dust
[1:41:48] thou shall return now he said he said by
[1:41:51] the sweat of your brow you'll do these
[1:41:54] things so by physical effort this is how
[1:41:56] you're going to get food before the fall
[1:41:58] it wasn't that way amen otherwise why
[1:42:02] would that be a curse you understand so
[1:42:05] beforehand he operated in a very
[1:42:07] different way to after the
[1:42:09] fall
[1:42:10] yeah and so Genesis but but you say well
[1:42:15] in Genesis 2:5 it says there's no man to
[1:42:16] till the ground and true because man was
[1:42:19] Spirit man yeah and then he was put in a
[1:42:22] fleshly body
[1:42:24] yeah and so but I do not think it was
[1:42:27] physical strength that they would use to
[1:42:30] till the
[1:42:31] ground because before the because
[1:42:34] otherwise it wouldn't have been part of
[1:42:35] the curse that would have been physical
[1:42:36] effort or sweat of the brow to bring
[1:42:38] forth food now amen the second Adam
[1:42:42] reveals
[1:42:45] this
[1:42:48] because Jesus was called the second Adam
[1:42:51] and he did everything the first Adam did
[1:42:54] yeah I'm just going to come to that now
[1:42:56] God
[1:42:58] became
[1:43:00] so as I said children get their nature
[1:43:03] and abilities from their parents or or
[1:43:05] forbears yeah but remember there was no
[1:43:07] one before Adam it was God then Adam so
[1:43:09] everything he received his ability his
[1:43:11] nature was from God yeah there wasn't
[1:43:14] something that was hidden in the family
[1:43:15] Tre that suddenly sprung itself up
[1:43:17] because that was the family tree amen
[1:43:20] yep so children are an expression of the
[1:43:22] life that was in and the father yeah and
[1:43:26] the scripture says Christ is the image
[1:43:28] of the invisible
[1:43:29] God yeah so God became flesh now
[1:43:34] remember he is the second Adam but I
[1:43:35] just want to get this as a you know a
[1:43:37] bit of background God became one of us
[1:43:40] you you know we know John 1 and verse
[1:43:42] one in the beginning was the word and
[1:43:45] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:43:47] God yep that and the word became flesh
[1:43:50] verse 14 and dwelt among us and we
[1:43:52] beheld as Glory the glory as of the only
[1:43:55] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:43:57] truth so it says there very expressly
[1:44:00] that Jesus is not another person from
[1:44:02] God the Father they're the same being
[1:44:04] that's why when Jesus revealed himself
[1:44:06] to Thomas after the resurrection Thomas
[1:44:08] says my Lord and my
[1:44:10] God Amen he's he actually had the
[1:44:13] Revelation this is god Jehovah God
[1:44:15] incarnate in a
[1:44:17] body amen it's very simple he didn't say
[1:44:21] you know oh my Lord
[1:44:23] you know he said my Lord and my God yeah
[1:44:27] amen now but you see God had to come
[1:44:31] down as man in order that we could
[1:44:33] understand him but also so he could
[1:44:35] understand us yeah so brother Bram says
[1:44:38] in Christ the mystery God revealed he
[1:44:40] said the first thing that God wanted to
[1:44:42] do was reveal himself to the people he
[1:44:44] couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God
[1:44:47] who covered all space Time and Eternity
[1:44:50] he could not he was too great to ever be
[1:44:52] Reve revealed to people because it would
[1:44:54] be too mysterious how could that great
[1:44:57] being that never did begin that after
[1:45:00] you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of
[1:45:03] billions and trillions and trillions of
[1:45:05] years of light space and out into the
[1:45:07] infinite into the eternity and a great
[1:45:10] creature that was all that and still is
[1:45:12] but what he wanted to
[1:45:14] do um he loved fatherhood for he was a
[1:45:18] father and the only way he could express
[1:45:20] it was to become a son of man
[1:45:23] yeah because he couldn't Express you
[1:45:25] know how can you think of
[1:45:28] Eternity you know you I remember when I
[1:45:30] was young one of the first things I have
[1:45:32] in my mind is who made God but God
[1:45:35] doesn't no one made God he's always been
[1:45:37] what do you mean you know you can't
[1:45:39] fathom that really even as an adult so
[1:45:43] where's his beginning he has no
[1:45:44] beginning where's his end he has no end
[1:45:47] what do you mean he doesn't have an end
[1:45:48] yeah how does that work eternity is
[1:45:51] always this there's no time in
[1:45:54] eternity you know you can't you can't
[1:45:57] mentally work you know really comprehend
[1:46:00] that that's righten you see so he
[1:46:02] couldn't he's too big and mysterious to
[1:46:05] really understand but that's why but he
[1:46:08] loved fatherhood he wanted to be a
[1:46:10] father and the only way he could fully
[1:46:12] Express that was to become a son of man
[1:46:14] become one of us amen amen because if
[1:46:17] your father if you never knew your
[1:46:18] father how do you really know what a
[1:46:20] father is that's amen you can read about
[1:46:22] it you can kind of you know read stories
[1:46:25] and things but until you experience a
[1:46:27] father being a father to you then you
[1:46:30] know what F you know what it means to
[1:46:32] have a dad it's the same thing with God
[1:46:35] you know even David I think he said we
[1:46:37] you read one of those psalms he's my
[1:46:39] father but he didn't he didn't he
[1:46:41] doesn't he didn't know it like we know
[1:46:45] amen because that was before
[1:46:47] Calvary
[1:46:48] yeah and
[1:46:50] so he had to become one of us that he
[1:46:53] could express he loved fatherhood for he
[1:46:56] was a father the only way he could do it
[1:46:58] was express it was to become a son of
[1:47:01] man so he did that that we could
[1:47:03] understand
[1:47:04] him but he also became flesh that he
[1:47:07] could understand us
[1:47:09] better yeah because we
[1:47:12] understand it's like learning anything
[1:47:15] you can know all the theory behind it
[1:47:17] but when you do it it's when you
[1:47:19] experience it it's a whole different
[1:47:21] thing so I said like driving a car you
[1:47:23] can know everything about the car but
[1:47:25] when you sit in the driver's seat you
[1:47:27] turn the ignition you put on your seat
[1:47:29] belt and you pull out for that first
[1:47:31] drive it's very different it's very
[1:47:35] different and so God he knows all things
[1:47:39] but there's a big but he had to
[1:47:41] experience what it was like that's what
[1:47:43] it says in Hebrews that he took on he
[1:47:45] didn't take on the nature of angels we
[1:47:47] took on the Flesh and Blood of us that
[1:47:49] he could be a merciful and faithful high
[1:47:52] priest that he could understand you and
[1:47:55] understand the infirmity of this flesh
[1:47:57] that he could relate to you amen amen
[1:48:01] right I'm so glad he did you lordes now
[1:48:04] brother says in the um in the sermon the
[1:48:06] Mighty God unveiled before us in 64 he
[1:48:09] says I was reading a story some years
[1:48:12] ago and in the story it said a great
[1:48:14] Noble King he says I forget the name of
[1:48:16] him just now I wasn't thinking about the
[1:48:19] story it was perhaps fiction but it
[1:48:21] leads us to a point that gives us
[1:48:23] background on what we want to say
[1:48:25] remember a sermon is the Mighty God
[1:48:26] Avail before us this King he was such a
[1:48:29] noble King and such a great lover of his
[1:48:32] subjects till one day before his guard
[1:48:34] and his royalty he said today you see me
[1:48:37] for your last time for many years and
[1:48:39] his guard and his Noble said to him good
[1:48:41] King why do you say that are you going
[1:48:43] to a foreign country somewhere to become
[1:48:45] an alien he said no I'm staying right
[1:48:48] here he said I'm going out amongst my
[1:48:51] subjects I'm going to become a peasant
[1:48:53] I'm going to cut wood with the wood
[1:48:55] Chopper I'm going to till the ground
[1:48:57] with the toiler I'm going to prune the
[1:48:59] vines with those who prune the vine I'm
[1:49:02] going to be one of them in order to get
[1:49:05] better acquainted with what they're
[1:49:07] doing and I love them and I want to be
[1:49:10] more acquainted with them personally
[1:49:12] they won't know me but yet I want to be
[1:49:15] acquainted with them in that way and the
[1:49:17] next morning when his delegates and all
[1:49:19] of his people seen him or the ones that
[1:49:21] was in the palace take off his crown l
[1:49:23] on the seat the throne take his robe off
[1:49:26] put on peasant clothes walk out amongst
[1:49:28] the common people now in that little
[1:49:30] story we find then about God they said
[1:49:33] to the king king we want you we love you
[1:49:36] we want you to remain King but he wanted
[1:49:38] be to become one of them to know them
[1:49:41] better and they' know him better what he
[1:49:43] really was it would display to them what
[1:49:46] he really was and that's what God did he
[1:49:49] changed himself from Jehovah God to
[1:49:52] become one of us that he might suffer he
[1:49:54] might taste death he might know what the
[1:49:56] sting of death was and to take the penal
[1:49:59] penalty of death upon himself he laid
[1:50:01] aside his crown and his robe and became
[1:50:03] one of us he washed feet with the lowely
[1:50:06] he dwelt in the tents with the poor he
[1:50:08] slept in the woods and in the streets
[1:50:10] with those who are underprivileged he
[1:50:12] became one of us that he might
[1:50:14] understand us better and that we might
[1:50:16] understand him better Hallelujah that's
[1:50:19] amazing last time up in New Guinea you
[1:50:22] know you know I talked about that I said
[1:50:25] how Jesus said foxes have dens birds
[1:50:28] have their nest but the son of man has
[1:50:30] nowhere to lay his head and these are
[1:50:32] people this is the poorest region of the
[1:50:34] country in its third world and they
[1:50:37] could see Jesus became poorer than them
[1:50:39] because they had homes they had food
[1:50:41] they had a village they had he didn't
[1:50:43] have these things the great king of
[1:50:45] glory became poorer than the poor
[1:50:48] hallelujah that's how great that's how
[1:50:50] great God is so great cuz he can make
[1:50:52] himself self so little am that's what
[1:50:54] makes him
[1:50:56] great amen that we might understand it
[1:50:59] so he might understand us better and we
[1:51:01] might understand him better but now we
[1:51:04] see in that form now he began to
[1:51:06] demonstrate everything Adam did before
[1:51:08] the
[1:51:09] fall so man before the fall as I said
[1:51:12] had dominion over the creation by the
[1:51:14] spoken word because the second Adam
[1:51:17] demonstrated everything the first Adam
[1:51:18] lost so he spoke to the storm and nature
[1:51:21] obeyed him he said peace be still as we
[1:51:23] sng this morning amen and and the storm
[1:51:26] had to be still he cursed the Fig Tree
[1:51:29] in Mark 11 showing that he is Lord over
[1:51:31] everything he went to a funeral every
[1:51:33] funeral he came across it never stayed a
[1:51:35] funeral I mean Lazarus didn't stay dead
[1:51:38] in the Tomb the you know you know the um
[1:51:41] lady's you know son that was being
[1:51:43] carried out to be buried Jesus
[1:51:45] intersected that funeral and the boy
[1:51:46] didn't stay dead I mean D's daughter
[1:51:49] didn't stay dead I mean there was near a
[1:51:52] funeral that Jesus went to in it day of
[1:51:53] funeral hallelujah hallelujah he
[1:51:56] multiplied the bread and the fish amen
[1:51:59] because showing he is the very Creator
[1:52:01] Hallelujah he fed thousands showing that
[1:52:03] he is the creator sickness had to obey
[1:52:05] him the kingdom of Hell had to obey him
[1:52:08] death couldn't hold him amen he he
[1:52:10] demonstrated dominion over everything
[1:52:12] that could be could have dominion overl
[1:52:15] amen he defeated everything yes Howell
[1:52:17] death in the grave couldn't hold him
[1:52:20] Hallelujah so he was demonstrating you
[1:52:22] know but the very fact that he had he he
[1:52:25] took control of nature from Satan that
[1:52:28] was squatting am mean in the storms and
[1:52:31] everything he took dominion over these
[1:52:33] things amen and Jesus would say in
[1:52:35] Matthew 28:18 all power on Heaven and
[1:52:37] Earth is given un me but then he would
[1:52:40] tell his disciples to go into all the
[1:52:43] world and to preach the gospel baptizing
[1:52:46] them teaching them all nations baptizing
[1:52:48] them in the name of the father and of
[1:52:49] the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching
[1:52:51] them to observe all things whatsoever I
[1:52:54] have commanded you and L with you always
[1:52:56] even to the end of the world and we know
[1:52:58] the name of the father and the son the
[1:53:00] Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:53:02] so now here was here was the second Adam
[1:53:04] remember the first Adam was told had
[1:53:07] Dominion subd it take dominion over the
[1:53:10] Earth and then now here comes the second
[1:53:12] Adam Hallelujah and he and he's actually
[1:53:16] the body he was in was part of the
[1:53:18] creation amen the Earth was cursed and
[1:53:21] God put on cursed Earth
[1:53:23] amen sure he is Virgin born but the very
[1:53:26] his body he suffered infirmities he was
[1:53:28] sick like we get sick am mean he was
[1:53:30] tempted like I'm tempted on All Points
[1:53:33] oh and you know many times we think that
[1:53:35] we're the only one who's gone through
[1:53:37] these things Jesus did it all amen amen
[1:53:40] he was suffered on all points I mean he
[1:53:42] was tempted on All Points yet without
[1:53:43] sin amen so he understands what it's
[1:53:45] like to be to be pressured to conform as
[1:53:49] a young child as an adult finding his
[1:53:52] way in life he knows what it's like cuz
[1:53:54] he's been there amen
[1:53:56] hallelujah and then so and then and then
[1:54:00] brother Braham says in the future home
[1:54:02] he says when Jesus was baptized on the
[1:54:04] River Jordan and the voice spake out
[1:54:06] from Heaven saying this is my beloved
[1:54:08] Son in whom I'm well pleased God was
[1:54:10] basically saying this is my piece of the
[1:54:13] earth that I'm going to use to redeem
[1:54:16] the rest of the earth
[1:54:19] amen and so that was the commission
[1:54:21] Jesus had remember the increase of his
[1:54:23] government what's he's going to have
[1:54:25] dominion he's going to subdue this
[1:54:27] creation and then he calls his disciples
[1:54:29] that his work would
[1:54:31] continue amen because their their um
[1:54:35] their Ministry was a continuation of his
[1:54:38] ministry but instead of being in one man
[1:54:40] he was now in a many membered body and
[1:54:43] Jesus when he was on Earth he cast out
[1:54:45] the devil wherever he found him he set
[1:54:48] the captives free he opened the eyes of
[1:54:50] the blind he set at Liberty those uh you
[1:54:53] know chained amen and then he
[1:54:55] commissioned his church to do the same
[1:54:57] thing amen because the Devil is a
[1:54:59] squatter we understand he is a squatter
[1:55:02] in this Earth but we have the privilege
[1:55:04] amen by the anointing of God to cast out
[1:55:07] Satan wherever we find them am mean to
[1:55:10] take this Earth under
[1:55:11] Dominion amen that's that's that's the
[1:55:14] right that's the preaching of the Gospel
[1:55:16] that's the living of this word amen it's
[1:55:18] not just me standing here preaching the
[1:55:20] gospel you preach a sermon every day
[1:55:22] amen amen your life preaches louder than
[1:55:24] your words amen that's right amen amen
[1:55:27] so you go and you create an atmosphere
[1:55:29] around you amen and then when you really
[1:55:31] meet people you say Lord open their eyes
[1:55:34] amen set them free amen amen cuz they
[1:55:37] see a life I trust they do amen and so
[1:55:39] the so the commission given to the
[1:55:41] church was subdue this creation have
[1:55:44] dominion expand the borders of the
[1:55:45] Kingdom right amen that's the that's the
[1:55:49] reason we're here friends we're not here
[1:55:50] just to have church and oh yeah believe
[1:55:52] in a prophet whatever more but the same
[1:55:54] God Amen that same anointing that was on
[1:55:57] Adam amen that was on the second Adam as
[1:56:00] now in the second Eve huj as in you and
[1:56:02] I amen the same one in the book of Acts
[1:56:05] is present among us and that's why it
[1:56:07] says in Mark 16 he says go into all the
[1:56:10] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:56:11] creature and these signs and he that
[1:56:14] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:56:16] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:56:18] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:56:20] that believe now it's now you're going
[1:56:22] to demonstrate What I've Done remember
[1:56:25] he cast out Legion thousands of devils
[1:56:27] out of that one man Mary Magdalene had
[1:56:29] Seven Devils in her you know what was
[1:56:32] all the sicknesses that he healed he
[1:56:34] cast out you know brother says what is
[1:56:36] cancer it's a demon Spirit now
[1:56:38] perverting cells in a body that's right
[1:56:40] amen and the life has to be driven out
[1:56:42] of it what's a virus it's a life oh you
[1:56:45] say well it's a b you know you can see
[1:56:47] the biochemical mechanism of how a virus
[1:56:50] spreads it's still alive yes amen that's
[1:56:54] why I pray God kill the life out of the
[1:56:55] thing then let the body heal
[1:56:59] itself then now so he says now and these
[1:57:02] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:57:04] they'll follow you just walk with God
[1:57:06] remember this is not a checklist God
[1:57:08] will vindicate your life in whatever
[1:57:11] degree he wants to do it he's going to
[1:57:12] do it amen and these signs shall for
[1:57:16] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:57:18] cast out Devils who's asked for healing
[1:57:21] who's prayed for someone who's sick
[1:57:23] what's happened a devil's been cast out
[1:57:25] amen amen they shall speak with new
[1:57:28] tongues they shall take up serpant and
[1:57:30] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:57:32] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:57:34] the sick and they shall recover who's
[1:57:38] who seen that happen they shall recover
[1:57:40] that's why you just got to have
[1:57:41] confidence it doesn't matter if you
[1:57:42] don't see anything straight away
[1:57:44] remember it's your faith sometimes God
[1:57:47] does it like this for you CU he wants to
[1:57:49] build your faith other times he wants to
[1:57:51] see do you have confidence in me amen do
[1:57:54] you have confidence in the prayer you
[1:57:55] have said amen oh I don't see anything
[1:57:59] do you have confidence of you know what
[1:58:01] you've prayed hallelujah amen and then
[1:58:03] whatever the outcome is you just say
[1:58:04] praise the Lord cuz ultimately remember
[1:58:07] he's
[1:58:07] Sovereign amen he's Sovereign and is
[1:58:11] choosing you know David David and his
[1:58:14] first child to bash Sheba was was sick
[1:58:16] to death and he prayed on his face
[1:58:19] asking that God would intercede and and
[1:58:21] and not take the child's life amen so so
[1:58:24] David wasn't just blaz about it cuz
[1:58:27] sometimes people get very blaz well if
[1:58:28] it's God's will it'll happen if it's not
[1:58:30] you know but he he prayed with
[1:58:33] everything was in him Lord child you're
[1:58:36] my rock but then God took the child what
[1:58:40] did he do he washed himself he went into
[1:58:42] the temple he said glory to God you got
[1:58:45] read about in the scripture amen cuz he
[1:58:48] knew God was in control of everything
[1:58:51] you have to that's not being was it
[1:58:52] fatalistic whatever you understand God
[1:58:55] is Sovereign he's not an Aon boy amen
[1:58:59] amen he's not our little mascot that we
[1:59:00] go get and do things God is Not That Way
[1:59:04] amen a lot of people these days try to
[1:59:05] treat God like a mascot or an Aron boy
[1:59:08] right and what does that mean that means
[1:59:09] the person's will is greater than than
[1:59:11] God's will that's right amen he is a
[1:59:14] sovereign God he can cause us all to
[1:59:16] cease to exist if he wants to he can do
[1:59:18] whatever he wants am amen he is
[1:59:22] Sovereign this is not a
[1:59:23] democracy amen Us in God is not a
[1:59:26] democracy he's our King and we love him
[1:59:29] and he loves us and the reason we love
[1:59:31] him is because he first loved
[1:59:33] us
[1:59:35] hallelujah now and then he says another
[1:59:38] place he says you shall tread on
[1:59:40] scorpions and serpents they shall not
[1:59:42] harm you it wasn't speaking of literally
[1:59:44] you see people they do snake dances and
[1:59:45] things he's not talking about natural
[1:59:47] natural things necessarily he's talking
[1:59:49] about demon power he says you'll tread
[1:59:51] upon on them you'll have dominion amen
[1:59:54] amen we're called to subdue these things
[1:59:57] friends
[1:59:58] Hallelujah and then so the expans so the
[2:00:02] book of Acts is the kingdom expanding
[2:00:05] amen amen it goes from 120 to 5,000 then
[2:00:08] how of many more and the kingdom expands
[2:00:12] so I could say the garden expands like
[2:00:14] in Genesis 1 subdue go subdue it
[2:00:16] replenish multiply upon the face of the
[2:00:18] Earth subdue the creation and that's
[2:00:22] what happened in the New Testament now
[2:00:24] because you see real to to to
[2:00:28] Really uh what do you call it natural
[2:00:32] birth wasn't God's perfect will yeah but
[2:00:36] but God allowed it CU this is how he
[2:00:38] knew it would happen yeah God really
[2:00:40] ordained in the beginning that his
[2:00:42] children will be spoken into existence y
[2:00:45] that's right yeah that was God's perfect
[2:00:47] will but God knew that we'd have to be
[2:00:50] born how we're born amen
[2:00:52] okay and there's nothing wrong with that
[2:00:54] in marriage you understand don't get all
[2:00:57] uh Victorian about these things right
[2:01:01] amen amen amen okay but you see God's
[2:01:05] perfect will was that we are to be
[2:01:09] spoken into existence you understand and
[2:01:11] so now when when when someone is
[2:01:14] inspired to preach the word and someone
[2:01:17] is born again you understand that is
[2:01:20] actually man multiplying and
[2:01:22] replenishing the Earth because it's
[2:01:25] actually bringing to birth real sons and
[2:01:27] daughters of God you understand
[2:01:30] Hallelujah that's why that's why the
[2:01:33] word must put on flesh in every
[2:01:36] generation amen that's why there's
[2:01:38] ministry that's why there's Sunday
[2:01:40] school that's why you create an
[2:01:42] atmosphere remember everyone has a part
[2:01:43] in the church everyone has a part in the
[2:01:46] church you Cate an atmosphere you pull
[2:01:48] on the gift that's in front of you you
[2:01:50] sing and worship create an atmosphere
[2:01:52] around you you bring God down oh no one
[2:01:54] ever notices me the people in the Pew is
[2:01:56] actually the most you pray for the
[2:01:59] services brother Braham says the the
[2:02:01] reason I'm successful is people pray
[2:02:04] amen and that's the reason his ministry
[2:02:06] was so successful because people
[2:02:07] genuinely pray to God Mo take that man
[2:02:09] and use him amen it wasn't it wasn't him
[2:02:13] remember everything you know you know
[2:02:16] you look at an iceberg they would say
[2:02:18] it's the tip of the iceberg that's out
[2:02:19] of the water it's actually The
[2:02:21] Underneath but the actually the
[2:02:23] important part of the iceberg the the
[2:02:25] Unseen part it's the same thing with a
[2:02:28] group of people it's the Unseen part
[2:02:30] that is the most important amen and
[2:02:33] remember we're not here to get uh praise
[2:02:36] from
[2:02:37] man I mean sure it's nice brother R says
[2:02:40] if you don't want praise for Man
[2:02:41] actually you're you know you know you're
[2:02:43] lying because we like those things do
[2:02:45] you know you oh I appreciate that I was
[2:02:47] that was so nice but at the end of the
[2:02:48] day we want praise from God amen amen
[2:02:51] amen and so now that is the that is the
[2:02:54] order of the kingdom is to expand it and
[2:02:57] to bring this creation to subject Amen
[2:03:01] to the word of
[2:03:03] God and
[2:03:05] now it's the same thing with us you say
[2:03:07] well how do you now I'm going to bring
[2:03:09] this into your life CU how do you bring
[2:03:11] things
[2:03:12] subject Amen in the Book of Revelation
[2:03:17] 12:9 it says this and the Great Dragon
[2:03:20] was cast out that old serpent called the
[2:03:21] the devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[2:03:24] whole world and he was cast out into the
[2:03:26] Earth and his angels were cast out with
[2:03:28] him and I heard a loud voice saying in
[2:03:30] heaven now has come salvation and
[2:03:32] strength in the Kingdom of our God and
[2:03:35] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[2:03:37] of our Brethren is cast down which
[2:03:39] accuse them before our God day and night
[2:03:42] so there Comes A Time remember before
[2:03:43] this says Michael and his angels fought
[2:03:45] with Luc for the dragon and his angels
[2:03:47] and the enemy was cast down to the Earth
[2:03:50] but he says so this is not the ones that
[2:03:52] overcame him is not speaking about
[2:03:54] angels because there's no blood for
[2:03:56] Angels there's only blood for men and
[2:03:58] women you understand so they overcame
[2:04:01] him by the blood of the lamb and the
[2:04:02] word of their testimony amen so this
[2:04:05] scripture must become lived
[2:04:08] out now I'm going to try and wrap this
[2:04:10] up I see I see that that thing on the
[2:04:12] wall moves you see but we we are here
[2:04:16] Amen to live out this scripture amen
[2:04:18] because this salvation that he's
[2:04:20] speaking about is actually full
[2:04:21] Redemption coming I mean cuz Satan is
[2:04:24] cast out upon the Earth in the end time
[2:04:26] and as the bride goes up Satan comes
[2:04:29] down and we're seeing that right now and
[2:04:32] me because we're
[2:04:33] ascending we're ascending the bride is
[2:04:35] coming to her position and as the Bride
[2:04:37] Comes to her position Satan is cast out
[2:04:41] Hallelujah you see the mechanics is all
[2:04:43] there for his last ride I mean the pale
[2:04:45] horses you know all of his mechanics are
[2:04:47] there you see this last Pope everyone
[2:04:50] you know it's like a day night change
[2:04:52] everyone hated the church he comes in oh
[2:04:54] he's so wonderful you know oh can't get
[2:04:57] enough of him why cuz the mechanics are
[2:04:59] here and I'll say this if he's not the
[2:05:02] last one there'll be someone in the
[2:05:03] office that will fulfill it it doesn't
[2:05:05] matter who it is I'm saying the
[2:05:06] mechanics are all there amen for for
[2:05:09] Satan to become incarnate in a man and
[2:05:12] that's because we're ascending that's
[2:05:14] why he's falling the devil now amen so
[2:05:17] these people we the bride in this day
[2:05:20] overcomes them by the blood of the Lamb
[2:05:23] amen the revelation of who he is what he
[2:05:25] did for us amen he's our Rock and by the
[2:05:28] word of their testimony as I said in the
[2:05:31] very beginning you have to speak amen if
[2:05:34] the first Adam took Dominion amen if he
[2:05:37] had dominion over creation by the spoken
[2:05:40] word and that same anointing that was on
[2:05:42] him was in the second Adam amen the
[2:05:45] fullness of God every B was in Christ
[2:05:47] Jesus our lord amen and he had Dominion
[2:05:49] by
[2:05:50] speaking amen and that same anointing is
[2:05:53] now upon the bride of
[2:05:54] Christ hallelujah amen then what happens
[2:05:57] now is you have to speak amen amen amen
[2:06:00] the word words of your testimony and
[2:06:03] that is not only your experience but
[2:06:05] this is your testimony that's why don't
[2:06:08] confess negative
[2:06:09] things amen you may say I need prayer
[2:06:13] saying you need prayer is not negative
[2:06:15] actually saying I want to join forces
[2:06:17] amen I want to drive this thing out amen
[2:06:20] amen oh I'm going through a patch that's
[2:06:22] not negative say fight me in this battle
[2:06:25] amen I so I so moved just thinking about
[2:06:27] you know there was the brothers in Japan
[2:06:28] and you know people we pray for you know
[2:06:31] people who not the Prem I think we're
[2:06:33] with them amen we're with the bride of
[2:06:35] Christ Hallelujah they might never know
[2:06:36] us or meet us what it doesn't matter but
[2:06:38] we're with them Hallelujah because we're
[2:06:40] not divided amen around the world
[2:06:43] there's a body moving under the same
[2:06:45] inspiration that you know the same God
[2:06:47] that's in US is in them that's why you
[2:06:49] know that's why I just pray Lord
[2:06:52] let them know we're with them that
[2:06:54] there's people praying amen
[2:06:56] hallelujah but you know so there's
[2:06:59] nothing wrong with those things and we
[2:07:01] should it doesn't show weaked Faith
[2:07:03] we're just in a battle that's right amen
[2:07:06] so you should say yeah help you know
[2:07:08] pray for me I'm going through something
[2:07:10] but a negative confession
[2:07:11] is you know is is basically denying What
[2:07:15] the Lord Has Done you know cuz you get
[2:07:18] down you get weary you say is God really
[2:07:20] real is this really happening you know
[2:07:22] don't go down that road I told yeah I
[2:07:25] say it's like a hamster wheel don't get
[2:07:26] on that hamster wheel cuz you don't get
[2:07:28] anywhere you just get
[2:07:30] tired amen David both David and
[2:07:35] Paul they knew their God was their Rock
[2:07:38] Amen and whatever came their way they
[2:07:41] knew God was able amen amen amen you say
[2:07:45] well what about praying for a
[2:07:47] Believer but that say a cancer or
[2:07:50] something takes their life
[2:07:51] well that was God's ordained way for
[2:07:53] them to go and remember as soon as they
[2:07:56] leave that body to their glorified body
[2:07:59] amen that cancer is
[2:08:02] defeated amen amen because that cancer
[2:08:04] was only a vehicle for God getting to go
[2:08:06] to that place you understand amen but if
[2:08:11] God heals them praise the Lord amen
[2:08:13] whatever God wants to do amen amen is
[2:08:16] that okay amen you understand it's not a
[2:08:18] defeat it's only a defeat if people die
[2:08:21] in unbelief but if someone dies in faith
[2:08:24] that's a victory hallelujah
[2:08:27] amen and that's why the victory is not
[2:08:30] your Circumstance the victory is Are you
[2:08:32] standing upon the rock and do you have
[2:08:34] confidence in your rock right amen
[2:08:37] that's the main thing because if you
[2:08:38] know in whom you have believed like Paul
[2:08:40] said amen nothing will move
[2:08:43] you Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[2:08:46] and a good Builder doesn't let his
[2:08:49] building come off its foundation
[2:08:54] now we have to
[2:08:55] speak now brother Braham says I don't
[2:08:58] have the quote on me but it says of
[2:08:59] someone is Anointed and they're speaking
[2:09:03] under inspiration it's the same as deity
[2:09:06] speaking Every Mountain has to move
[2:09:09] nothing can stand before that man or
[2:09:10] woman amen because if if it's not me
[2:09:14] speaking or me praying speak about you
[2:09:16] as well if you're anointed to to to pray
[2:09:20] or to speak that's not you speaking
[2:09:23] that's deity
[2:09:24] speaking and nothing can stand before
[2:09:27] that kind of person right amen amen amen
[2:09:30] that's why that's why now when you have
[2:09:32] a confession if you're inspired
[2:09:35] something grips your heart I'm going to
[2:09:36] get well or something's going to turn
[2:09:37] out right and you speak it out then
[2:09:40] actually your situation comes subject to
[2:09:42] your testimony
[2:09:44] amen and I'll show you that in the
[2:09:46] Scripture it says in 2 Corinthians 4:13
[2:09:49] we having the same Spirit of Faith
[2:09:51] according it as is written I believed
[2:09:54] and therefore I have spoken we also
[2:09:56] believe and therefore speak amen because
[2:09:59] God's looking for a response remember
[2:10:01] Adam Jesus spoken word everything was
[2:10:05] under their Dominion the same God is in
[2:10:07] you that's what I'm trying to get you to
[2:10:09] see you've got to speak to your Mountain
[2:10:12] amen amen it may not be a literal
[2:10:15] Mountain it could be sickness it could
[2:10:17] be trouble in the family whatever it is
[2:10:18] you've got to speak to your Mountain the
[2:10:20] enemy May may be going Toe to Toe with
[2:10:22] you you've got to speak to your enemy
[2:10:25] don't cow don't cow to the devil amen
[2:10:30] now there's a story I won't read it but
[2:10:32] I'll just I'll just paraphrase it
[2:10:33] quickly it say behold the greater than
[2:10:35] greater than all of them is here in in
[2:10:38] in 62 and he speaks of a blind man who
[2:10:42] who comes into the comes into the prayer
[2:10:45] line and this BL blind man was a
[2:10:48] Catholic and he comes up brother Braham
[2:10:50] sees a vision over him that that he can
[2:10:52] see and he prays for him he says thus
[2:10:54] sayith the Lord you're healed and he
[2:10:56] goes off but then he comes back into the
[2:10:57] prayer line again and then and then um
[2:11:01] and then and then the guy says to
[2:11:02] brother Bram I thought you said I was
[2:11:04] healed and then the and then brother
[2:11:07] says to him I thought you said you
[2:11:09] believed he says he says just just just
[2:11:11] go on your way thanking God you can see
[2:11:14] this guy's blind he selling pencils on
[2:11:16] the roadside all the and he says praise
[2:11:18] the Lord I'm Healed and selling papers
[2:11:20] extra extra I can see the Lord's healed
[2:11:22] me he started to make fun of him two
[2:11:24] weeks later he's sitting in a barers you
[2:11:26] remember you got to speak it until you
[2:11:27] believe it you understand speak it till
[2:11:29] it anchors down here yeah and so he's
[2:11:32] sitting in a barber's chair Stone blind
[2:11:35] and then the Barber's giving him a shave
[2:11:37] starts to make fun of him I thought you
[2:11:39] said you know you're healed you're down
[2:11:40] this me and then he says yeah praise the
[2:11:43] Lord I'm Healed and his eyes came open
[2:11:45] and he ran down the street
[2:11:46] rejoicing it took a couple of weeks you
[2:11:49] understand but he spoke broke it and
[2:11:52] eventually his situation came subject to
[2:11:54] his confession hallelujah amen thank you
[2:11:58] Lord hallelujah amen David and Goliath
[2:12:01] now I'm just going to maybe mention this
[2:12:03] and I'm sorry time has got away but
[2:12:06] David when he came to
[2:12:08] Goliath David didn't have a sword you
[2:12:12] understand but he is speaking he is
[2:12:14] speaking now and the situation of that
[2:12:16] outcome of that battle was the result of
[2:12:18] what he
[2:12:19] said amen because he said to he said to
[2:12:22] Goliath I'm going to cut your head off
[2:12:25] he didn't have a sword but he says I'm
[2:12:27] going to cut your head off this day amen
[2:12:30] and what happened he took Goliath's
[2:12:32] sword and he cut his head off amen amen
[2:12:35] he killed you know he hit him with the
[2:12:37] stone and he jumped on him cut off his
[2:12:39] head with gone sword and so what
[2:12:42] happened what he said came to pass
[2:12:44] exactly as he said and I believe because
[2:12:47] David was walking under the inspiration
[2:12:49] of God amen amen because they all
[2:12:51] believe remember Israel there they all
[2:12:54] believed that God was a god of war that
[2:12:56] could fight their battles they all knew
[2:12:58] it mentally but it took someone for it
[2:13:00] to anchor down in their heart amen and
[2:13:03] when it anchored down in David's heart
[2:13:05] nothing could move David amen you
[2:13:07] understand and then now he says this in
[2:13:09] works as Faith expressed he says why
[2:13:12] David was no kind of match for him
[2:13:14] speaking of Goliath with any kind of
[2:13:16] weapon he was no match that's man's
[2:13:19] shoulders speaking of goaly says was
[2:13:21] probably 10 12T across he's probably
[2:13:23] standing 14 15t High spear like a
[2:13:26] Weaver's needle probably 20t long the
[2:13:29] blade on it maybe 4ot across and a
[2:13:31] little David standing there with a
[2:13:33] little piece of leather goat skin or
[2:13:35] sheep skin and two piece of of of string
[2:13:38] tied to it remember that's a sling but
[2:13:41] it was revealed to him Revelation struck
[2:13:43] him amen he said God that took me out of
[2:13:46] the paws of the bear and out of the paws
[2:13:48] of the lion how much more will he
[2:13:50] deliver that uncircumcised Philistine in
[2:13:52] my hand his brothers way more able to do
[2:13:56] it cuz they were fully grown men in
[2:13:58] armor wait Saul Head and Shoulders above
[2:14:01] his army but you see it wasn't revealed
[2:14:04] to them he says amen there it is they
[2:14:08] believed it could be done they believed
[2:14:10] that God could do it but it wasn't
[2:14:13] revealed to them it was revealed to
[2:14:15] David now there's the difference right
[2:14:18] there if it's absolutely r reveal to you
[2:14:22] that God is going to heal you you're
[2:14:24] going to get well amen you're going to
[2:14:26] get it I don't care what's wrong with
[2:14:28] you what what's the odds it may be worse
[2:14:31] than David and Goliath but if it's
[2:14:34] revealed to you amen so if it's not in
[2:14:38] here not because it excites you but
[2:14:39] because it's anchored down in
[2:14:41] here cuz that remember he said his
[2:14:43] brothers knew it could be done Saul knew
[2:14:46] it could be done but it was revealed to
[2:14:48] David amen and because it was revealed
[2:14:50] to David he said I'm going to cut your
[2:14:52] head off this day amen he didn't care he
[2:14:54] didn't have a sword God had provided a
[2:14:56] sword that just turned out to be Goliath
[2:14:58] sword amen that's right Hallelujah so
[2:15:02] now we we are
[2:15:06] called to do the same thing you
[2:15:08] understand you have to speak you have to
[2:15:10] speak to your situation that's right you
[2:15:13] understand God has to come anoint you
[2:15:16] doesn't matter what age you are David
[2:15:17] wasn't that old amen you understand but
[2:15:20] that whole battle was the outcome of the
[2:15:22] battle as I said before I trust this SS
[2:15:24] in it's because he spoke those words as
[2:15:27] why it happened that way it happened
[2:15:29] exactly as David said yeah exactly as
[2:15:34] David said and so you've got to you know
[2:15:37] I heard this testimony from from brother
[2:15:39] Tim PR's Church there was a man there
[2:15:42] who wanted to go on this Japanese trip
[2:15:44] but he had no money to do it he wanted
[2:15:46] to go he felt he felt wanted to go but
[2:15:49] he had no money to do it and so he goes
[2:15:51] and and uh he meets this other man he's
[2:15:54] never met before not even a believer and
[2:15:57] he begin to tell him how you know you
[2:15:58] know how they do Mission work and he has
[2:16:00] a burden to go and this guy said I'm
[2:16:02] going to pay your
[2:16:03] trip you know you know I'm going to help
[2:16:05] fund it and then and then so he said you
[2:16:08] know should I make a check out to you or
[2:16:09] to the church what should I do and then
[2:16:11] he said I'll just make it out to the
[2:16:13] church and you know and he didn't see
[2:16:14] him after that and then he goes see and
[2:16:16] then he goes to see brother Tim he says
[2:16:18] you know this you know I just had this
[2:16:19] meeting with this man he says he's gonna
[2:16:21] help donate for the trip and then he
[2:16:23] says I don't know yeah but maybe he'll
[2:16:25] just give like $500 or something and
[2:16:27] brother Tim says no he's going to pay
[2:16:30] for your trip and he's going to give us
[2:16:31] $10,000 to help for the rest of the
[2:16:33] missionary work and it happened exactly
[2:16:35] that
[2:16:36] wayen amen that wasn't him speaking God
[2:16:40] you understand but it happened but the
[2:16:42] outcome was what happened came out of
[2:16:44] his mouth you understand amen hallelujah
