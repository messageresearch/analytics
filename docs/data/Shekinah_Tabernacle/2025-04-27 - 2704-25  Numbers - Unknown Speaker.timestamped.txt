[39:24] Is it going on your

[39:33] yet.
[39:34] Sorry. Trying to see if this one

[39:56] 22:13. It's not going on this one here

[40:09] front. Try it on this one.
[40:24] Sorry, I just need to get this up. Oh,
[40:25] we can read we can we can read that one.
[40:27] Just it's just loading up the slides
[40:29] here. It's a few of
[40:32] them. Um no, bring that you can bring
[40:34] the scripture up there. And
[40:37] um behold uh I am Alpha and Omega, the
[40:42] beginning and the end, the first and the
[40:44] last. You can have your seats this
[40:56] morning. So I've got a um I want to
[40:59] speak on a a small thought this morning
[41:02] um called numbers. And
[41:06] um when we look in the word of God and
[41:10] when we when we start to understand God,
[41:12] we understand that God's a God of
[41:14] numbers. He created this concept called
[41:17] a number called a a thing that would
[41:20] repeat and make certain amount of these
[41:22] things. You know, it's it's we often
[41:24] take for granted, I think, the things
[41:26] that God creates as though they just uh
[41:28] they just arrived. But everything that
[41:30] is here had had to have been like it had
[41:33] to have been created. It's been like the
[41:35] concepts, the ideas have been have been
[41:37] created. I'm just still I've just got to
[41:39] talk a bit till everything loads up.
[41:43] Um
[41:44] and I've in my own life, I've always
[41:47] followed numbers. Like I remember when
[41:49] we went to um when I went over to China
[41:52] and we couldn't really speak much
[41:54] Chinese when we got there. And I guess
[41:56] I've got a young family and we're
[41:58] turning up in the middle of Beijing. We
[41:59] don't know who's going to pick us up. We
[42:00] don't know what's going on and we're
[42:02] just getting hauled onto buses and
[42:04] trains and everything and and um I
[42:07] couldn't understand a word that people
[42:09] were saying. Thank you. Or I couldn't
[42:11] read a word of the Chinese um
[42:14] hieroglyphics and that whatever you call
[42:16] it, but I could read numbers and so I
[42:18] would always take note of the numbers
[42:19] that would be on the carriages or the
[42:20] numbers of the hotels and they were
[42:22] always good numbers. you know, would
[42:23] always be on carriage number three or
[42:25] number seven or room number 307 or
[42:28] something. The first time we got a bad
[42:31] number was when they put us in our
[42:32] apartment that I didn't want and we were
[42:34] on number 602 or something and I said
[42:37] there's no way I was staying here cuz I
[42:38] wanted to live out in the country and I
[42:40] said I'm not staying in this apartment.
[42:42] Not that I didn't I didn't want to stay
[42:44] there because of the number. I just said
[42:45] I want to live in the country, not in
[42:46] the city. And they they plonked us in
[42:49] this apartment in the city. And I said
[42:51] to Shannon, "You watch this apartment
[42:52] number will be a bad number on the door.
[42:54] It'll be a bad and it was a sixth floor
[42:56] number two." I'm like, "See, we ain't
[42:57] staying here." Told the guy, "We're not
[42:59] staying, man. I told you country. If I
[43:02] moved here, I live in the country." Oh,
[43:04] foreigners can't live in the country.
[43:06] Well, they do
[43:07] now. Put me in the country. So, we ended
[43:11] up um they put us in a little garden
[43:14] shed. We renovated a a small garden
[43:16] shed.
[43:18] And all the locals that even lived out
[43:20] there, all the poor farmers were going,
[43:21] "Man, you guys are living in here. This
[43:22] is a garden
[43:24] shed." But it was good.
[43:28] Okay. Okay, we're going. All right, I'm
[43:31] going to go quite fast. Is that all
[43:32] right? You are you all had your coffee?
[43:33] You're you're ready to go this morning.
[43:36] Sharp. Okay. This is going to be a lot
[43:39] of information for you. Okay. So, I want
[43:41] you sharp and thinking and aware. Okay.
[43:43] And if I maybe after a while I can have
[43:44] you stand up and you can move around and
[43:46] keep your it's going to be more thinking
[43:48] rather
[43:49] than there is inspiration but you know
[43:52] some of these things are just more a lot
[43:53] of information that you got to put
[43:54] together. Okay. So I'm going to go fast
[43:57] from now. Is that all right? Okay. All
[44:00] right. We know that this is just simple
[44:01] stuff at the start, but we know that God
[44:03] has numbers and essentially these are
[44:05] the the majority of his numbers that he
[44:08] uses are 1 3 5 7 8 12 40 and 50. As a
[44:12] general rule, those are his main numbers
[44:13] that he uses. If you want to check that
[44:15] God's in something, he will generally be
[44:17] following some of these numbers
[44:18] somewhere. Um, so I'm going to start off
[44:20] with the numbers one and three.
[44:23] Essentially, you could say that
[44:24] represents one represents God and three
[44:26] represents perfection. So that's like
[44:28] like a perfect God. You know, God is one
[44:29] God and God perfects everything in
[44:31] threes. And Deuteronomy says here, "O
[44:34] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
[44:36] Thou shalt and thou shalt love the Lord
[44:38] thy God with all thy heart, with all thy
[44:41] soul, and with all thy
[44:43] might." Later on, one of the in Mark it
[44:46] says, "And one of the scribes came, and
[44:48] having heard them reasoning together,
[44:50] and perceiving that he had answered them
[44:52] well, asked him, which is the first
[44:54] commandment of all. And Jesus answered
[44:56] him and said, "The first of all the
[44:58] commandments is here. O Israel, the Lord
[45:00] our God is one
[45:02] Lord. One Lord." He's not three. He's
[45:04] not four. He's not five. You know, some
[45:06] Hindu and different people have like a
[45:08] thousand gods. You know, it's confusing.
[45:10] Just give me one. I'm not that smart.
[45:13] Give me
[45:14] one. Keep it
[45:16] simple. And it's a Zechariah says, "And
[45:19] the Lord shall be king over all the
[45:21] earth." The Lord singular shall be king
[45:23] over all the earth. In that
[45:25] day shall there be one Lord and his name
[45:29] one. So we've got one Lord and he's got
[45:31] one
[45:32] name which is which essentially creates
[45:35] yourself a bit of a problem. This is why
[45:37] Christianity doesn't bode well with
[45:39] other religions. We we ask the question
[45:41] so all these other religions are welcome
[45:42] but Christianity is not. We should
[45:44] answer that ourselves and say, "Yeah, of
[45:45] course that's going to be the case
[45:46] because we are stubborn." Y because we
[45:49] say there's one Lord and everyone else
[45:50] is below us is below this Lord that we
[45:53] serve. We don't It's like we essentially
[45:55] say we ain't our God is not coexisting
[45:58] with any gods. No wonder people don't
[46:00] like
[46:02] you. Surprise. You're stubborn. You're
[46:05] you're you're uh you know what do they
[46:09] call it? Pigheaded. You just think, "Oh,
[46:10] you're so it's just you and nothing
[46:11] else." Uh yes. Of course, no one's going
[46:14] to like you, okay? And that's what
[46:15] essentially we say. There's one Lord, no
[46:17] one else. All your other gods have got
[46:18] listed all these other ones. They're
[46:20] nobodies. They're frauds. My god is king
[46:22] over all the earth. He's got one name.
[46:24] There's one god and he's the king.
[46:25] Right? So that's how that's that's how
[46:27] we we do it.
[46:29] He called his he the people try and had
[46:34] there's a bit of a debate over the name
[46:37] of God and it's terms of his what he
[46:39] called
[46:40] himself because it's sort of been lost
[46:42] over time but he called himself a lot of
[46:45] things but people have made a big debate
[46:46] over the name Yah Jehovah Yahweh or
[46:50] whoever it is because we only ended up
[46:52] essentially with these consonants here
[46:54] and no vowels. So, we've just sort of
[46:57] the translators when they translated the
[46:59] um King James or different times, they
[47:02] just put some vows in and made it sound
[47:03] like
[47:04] Jehovah. But then other people say, "No,
[47:06] it was Yahweh." And but we there's
[47:09] there's a bit of a debate over what his
[47:11] name is. Remember, we talked before
[47:12] about he's got one name, but it's not
[47:14] that anyway. We know what his name is
[47:16] anyway. So this doesn't this doesn't
[47:18] really matter whether it's Yahweh or
[47:21] Jehovah
[47:22] or I think the reason why they lost the
[47:24] name too that the the Hebrews is because
[47:26] the Jews is because they didn't actually
[47:27] say his name. They never spoke the name
[47:29] of God. So they kind of ended up
[47:32] forgetting it. But God's got many names
[47:34] in terms of how he describes himself. It
[47:35] says the Lord is peace. Uh the Lord is
[47:39] righteous. The Lord is shepherd. So the
[47:41] the Lord is peace comes from then Gideon
[47:43] built an altar there to the Lord and
[47:44] called it the Lord is peace. The other
[47:46] one says, "Then the princes of Israel
[47:49] and the king humbled themselves and
[47:50] said, "The Lord is righteous." Now, when
[47:52] it's a capital L O R D, that means it's
[47:55] calling it Yhovah or Yahweh or something
[47:58] like that. So, whenever you see the King
[47:59] James in capitals, it's naming that
[48:01] name. If you see it not a capital, it's
[48:04] it's just about a Lord, capital L. But
[48:07] but this Lord here is always referring
[48:09] to that one Lord. Okay? That's how the
[48:12] Bible is translated. Uh the Lord is my
[48:14] shepherd.
[48:16] The Lord is a God of justice. That verse
[48:18] says, "Therefore the Lord waits to be
[48:20] gracious to you and therefore he exalts
[48:22] himself to show mercy to you. For the
[48:24] Lord is a God of justice. Blessed are
[48:26] all those who wait for him." The next
[48:28] verse says, "For the Lord is our judge
[48:31] and the Lord is our Lordgiver and the
[48:32] Lord is our king. He will save us." So
[48:35] these are all descriptions of God. The
[48:37] Lord is our creator. Thus says the Lord
[48:39] who made the earth. The Lord who formed
[48:40] it to establish it. The Lord is his name
[48:44] or the Lord is our righteousness. Says
[48:45] in those days Judah will be saved and
[48:48] Israel will dwell securely and this is
[48:49] the name by which he will be called. The
[48:51] Lord is our righteousness. Okay, now I
[48:53] want to this essentially is a picture of
[48:56] what you'd call
[48:57] God. Okay, that because the Bible says
[49:01] no man has seen God at any time. And the
[49:03] concept of there being one God, God's
[49:05] got to be perfected in three, but he's
[49:07] got to be one. So I want to make sure we
[49:09] kind of understand this. Like if you had
[49:11] a look at God, that's what you'd see.
[49:12] He's the God that fills all time and
[49:14] space that that no man has seen at any
[49:16] time because the Bible says no man has
[49:18] beheld the father. Like this concept of
[49:20] God is just fills all time and space.
[49:22] That's God there. So if you want to see
[49:24] him, you've seen him. Okay? Now we talk
[49:28] about if you we talk about this thing
[49:30] called the logos. Okay. We say a logos.
[49:34] Now sometimes we just try and think
[49:35] we're clever because all we're saying is
[49:37] word in Greek right so it's just means
[49:41] word which means like if I speak a word
[49:45] then the word comes out from me but it
[49:47] is every part me
[49:49] right and and it's just describing this
[49:52] concept of then how do we understand
[49:54] this god eye because it's like a logos
[49:57] something if I speak my word comes out
[49:59] but you say well it's separate to you
[50:00] yeah it is but it's still me right and
[50:03] And that's how God describes this thing
[50:05] that came out of him to better
[50:07] understand God, right? Which was so he
[50:10] says, "I am God." That word is him, but
[50:13] it's just come out from him, right?
[50:14] Which we say it's a pillar of fire. It's
[50:16] whatever it is, but it's just this
[50:18] something that comes out from God to
[50:19] make us have a point to see him. Oh,
[50:22] there it is there. Instead of just being
[50:24] everywhere, it's like where is it? Oh,
[50:25] there it is there. Right? It's something
[50:27] that came out from God to that we can
[50:29] better understand, but it's still God.
[50:32] Right? That's what we call the word. We
[50:34] we as a example. That's why it says in
[50:37] the beginning was the word. And the word
[50:40] was here. It's this one here, right? Or
[50:43] this one. In the beginning was the word,
[50:46] which is the white bit. And the word was
[50:50] with God. Oh, which is And the word was
[50:52] God. Okay. Now, I'll rephrase that. In
[50:55] the beginning was the word, which is the
[50:57] fire bit, right? And the word was with
[51:00] God, which is with the white bit. And
[51:02] the word was God, which is all of it.
[51:05] Real simple, eh?
[51:07] Now, the Bible says, "The word became
[51:09] flesh and dwelt among us." Let me just
[51:11] say this here. That word that this that
[51:13] thing that word that was always called
[51:16] Jesus that made the world.
[51:18] So Jesus made the world. He was there.
[51:20] He made this, made that, created
[51:21] everything he spoke. Everything that
[51:23] happened happened
[51:24] from this word. Right? Then it says the
[51:27] word became flesh. So then this God,
[51:29] that Jehovah of the Old Testament, the
[51:31] Yahweh, whatever you want to call him,
[51:32] the the the Lord of righteousness, all
[51:34] those things, he just became flesh here,
[51:38] that word became flesh. So this is every
[51:40] part God right there. And his name was
[51:42] Jesus. So his name was Jesus all the way
[51:45] through,
[51:46] right? Because he was this thing, the
[51:48] expression of God. He was the word of
[51:50] God, right? So that's how we can think,
[51:52] well, there should be two. It's like,
[51:53] well, no, there's still the same God.
[51:55] It's just that one is just everywhere
[51:57] and one has come out that you can
[51:59] actually associate with like oh there's
[52:01] where I can meet God here in this point
[52:02] here right the other type he types
[52:05] himself after is water so if you have
[52:07] this water as a an intellectual concept
[52:10] if you take if I have a pool of water
[52:12] like this and I take a piece of water
[52:14] out of that water then I've got the same
[52:16] water just I've got two of them but it's
[52:19] the same water if I take 10 out I've got
[52:22] 11 pieces now but it's the same water
[52:24] it's exactly the same and I drink some.
[52:26] I've got the same water in me that's
[52:28] sitting in this lake that I just drank
[52:29] it from. Right? It's exactly the same
[52:30] thing. You say, "Oh, it's different.
[52:32] It's a different thing." Well, it is
[52:33] theoretically because it's in two
[52:35] different places, but it's exactly the
[52:36] same water. That's what the spirit of
[52:38] God is like. That's why we can have it
[52:39] all amongst us, but it's the same. It's
[52:42] one God, but it's spread out amongst us.
[52:44] There's a and and there's this God is
[52:47] like the the water is essentially Jesus
[52:51] that the the the white bit comes into
[52:53] us, right? which which ends up looking
[52:56] like this. This is essentially the three
[52:58] in one. You've got the you've got God
[53:00] that fills all time and space, right?
[53:02] Just everywhere. You've got this
[53:03] expression that came
[53:05] out which was and then became flesh. And
[53:08] then you've got the that same God
[53:11] dwelling in us. You've got one, two,
[53:13] three. Okay. So that's so that's why
[53:15] when you get to heaven, that's all
[53:17] you're going to see is one. And and
[53:19] that's why it says in him dwells the
[53:20] fullness of the godhead bodily. So
[53:22] everything it's all that this is this is
[53:24] essentially three in one right and that
[53:27] this is why this scripture says but to
[53:29] us there is but one God the father of
[53:33] whom are all things which is the white
[53:34] bit like that's where it all came from
[53:36] and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are
[53:39] all things cuz every because he came out
[53:41] and he made all the world made
[53:42] everything right that's that scripture
[53:45] there one here says uh there is one body
[53:49] and one spirit
[53:51] Even as you are called in one hope of
[53:53] your calling, one Lord there, there's
[53:56] only one faith which is the faith to get
[53:58] that spirit in you. That's right. It's
[54:00] the only faith there is. That's the
[54:02] faith. Receive the spirit of God in you.
[54:04] Um, one God and father of all, which is
[54:07] just you never you never see it. It's
[54:10] just it fills all time and space. Who is
[54:12] above all and through all and in you
[54:14] all. Amen. Right? It's everywhere. Okay.
[54:17] So that essentially is how you get a
[54:19] perfect God. One, two, three. Just that.
[54:22] Okay. So that's how God dwells in
[54:24] perfection. So if you see it like this,
[54:27] it's not a perfect God, right? If you if
[54:28] you're going to turn up to heaven and
[54:29] you're going to see two beings and a
[54:31] third spirit floating around, you're
[54:32] seeing an imperfect. That's not God,
[54:34] right? That's not one. That's three,
[54:38] right? Okay. So then I'll just quickly
[54:41] run through the threes. There's you've
[54:42] got the Father, you've got the Son,
[54:43] you've got the Holy Ghost, which is what
[54:44] we just talked about. You've got God is
[54:47] omnisient, omni, omnipotent,
[54:49] omnipresent. Um you've got time, which
[54:51] is uh past, present, future. So many
[54:54] things are divided in threes. You know,
[54:55] they say all good things come in threes.
[54:57] Or what do they say? Third time lucky.
[54:59] Cuz the first time you don't know how to
[55:00] do it. Second time, you correct the few
[55:02] things you did wrong the first time.
[55:04] Then by the third time you're like,
[55:05] "Right, I've got this." You know,
[55:07] something about the number three. Okay.
[55:09] All men descend from the three sons of
[55:11] Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. There were
[55:13] three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and
[55:15] Jacob. There's three major feasts that
[55:16] they had in the Old Testament. The feast
[55:18] of unleven bread, the feast of weeks,
[55:19] and the feast of in gathering. Well,
[55:20] that's the we'll get to that one in a
[55:23] bit. Um, in the ark of the covenant,
[55:25] there were three things. There was a pot
[55:27] of mana, there was Aaron's uh there was
[55:29] a pot of mana, Aaron's rod that
[55:31] buttered, and they had the ten
[55:32] commandments. Um, in the tabernacle,
[55:34] there's the um outer court, the holy
[55:37] place, the holiest of holies. There's
[55:38] three. And we are a triune being, body,
[55:41] soul, spirit. the the way to redemption
[55:43] is justification, sanctification,
[55:44] baptism, the Holy Ghost. There's all of
[55:46] these things that run in threes because
[55:48] God loves the number three. Um, and
[55:51] there's Bible says there's three that
[55:52] bear record in heaven. The father, the
[55:54] word, and the Holy Ghost, which is what
[55:55] we just saw. And there are three that
[55:57] bear witness in earth. The spirit, the
[55:58] water, and the blood, which is the
[56:01] spirit of God comes in us. The blood is
[56:02] has redeemed us, and we're baptized in
[56:05] water. Right? Um, you've got the true
[56:07] believer, make believe, the unbeliever.
[56:09] Jesus says, "I'm the way. I'm the truth.
[56:12] I'm the life. And when you when you look
[56:13] at those three things, that's pretty
[56:14] much all there is. He's the way to the
[56:16] truth that you get the life. One, two,
[56:18] three. Okay. He spent three days in the
[56:21] grave. You know, Jonah spent three days.
[56:23] Okay. Number four is a nothing number.
[56:25] But if you lived in China, number four
[56:27] is very bad. If you're in it's I
[56:30] actually know Chinese. So you got ye are
[56:32] s is four. And they have like the
[56:35] Chinese words are like they have s and
[56:37] then they got s or s s. It's like so
[56:41] it's the same word pronounced four
[56:43] different ways. So the
[56:45] other you've got s and then I don't know
[56:48] what the other word is but it's probably
[56:49] s and that means death you know. So one
[56:52] word means four. One word means uh
[56:54] death. So no one likes the number four
[56:56] because it it too closely resembles
[56:58] death.
[56:59] So no one was choosing it on their
[57:01] number plates. You know you'd get to
[57:03] choose your number plate. And so the
[57:04] number four never got chosen. So in the
[57:05] end, I think the government decided
[57:06] we're just going to wipe four from the
[57:08] number plates altogether. And this is
[57:10] actually a and the buildings don't have
[57:11] a level four or a 14 or a 24 on them.
[57:14] See this elevator here? Count it from
[57:17] the bottom. It goes 1 2 3
[57:20] 5. And it goes um 10 11 12 15
[57:26] uh 21 22 23 25. There's no fours. They
[57:30] hate
[57:31] four. Bad number. People are like that.
[57:34] We just have we have associations with
[57:36] good numbers, bad numbers. They love the
[57:38] number eight. Eight is because eight
[57:40] means
[57:43] um bar is eight. And then there's a word
[57:47] called bar and that means wealth, you
[57:49] know. So so they these two words sound
[57:52] the same that they they think the number
[57:54] eight is lucky. So the Beijing Olympics
[57:56] that were in
[57:58] 2008 opened at 8:00 on the eth day of
[58:01] the 8th month. There's going to be a
[58:03] lucky Olympics, you know, it's going to
[58:05] be a good
[58:05] Olympics.
[58:07] Um, I don't know much about the number
[58:09] five because it's an unusual, it's not
[58:11] so dominant as the other numbers, but
[58:13] but there are certain things. It does
[58:15] mean grace. There's a but it's it's not
[58:17] as prominent as other numbers. You've
[58:20] got the five-fold ministry. You've got
[58:21] we've got five senses. We got five
[58:23] natural senses. See, taste, hear, smell,
[58:25] feel. We've got five spiritual senses.
[58:27] If we don't have we actually have six,
[58:29] but I'll get to that soon. Memory,
[58:31] imagination, conscience, affection,
[58:32] reasoning. Do you know how you remember
[58:34] those? You say my car with an I. Don't
[58:39] look at that. Now say it now. And
[58:42] remember it. What are
[58:49] they? See, you can do it now. See my
[58:51] car. You'll never forget anymore. Just
[58:53] remember my car. Because we start saying
[58:56] it, then we forget half of it, you know.
[59:00] This moved me when I thought about this
[59:02] number six. I never used to like the
[59:03] number six. Who likes the number six? We
[59:05] all think it's a bad number, but my my
[59:08] my mind changed on this number when I
[59:10] realized this number is a perfect
[59:12] number. It's
[59:14] a mathematically it's the perfect
[59:16] number, too. And it's a number of man
[59:18] number six. I actually like the number
[59:20] six now. I claim number six. Psalm
[59:23] 239:14 says, "I'll praise thee for I am
[59:25] fearfully and wonderfully made.
[59:27] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[59:29] knoweth right well. Now I want to tell
[59:32] you something about the number six. It
[59:33] is what they call a perfect number
[59:34] because this happens to it
[59:38] essentially a perfect number. The
[59:39] numbers that it can divide by you can
[59:40] add them up and it equals the same.
[59:42] Right? So it goes you can add up 1 2 and
[59:47] three and it equals six or you can
[59:48] divide it by six divided by six is 1. 6
[59:51] divided by 3 you know you can you can
[59:54] you think oh that's a common thing in
[59:56] numbers. There's not
[59:57] really. Um the the next one is 28. The
[1:00:02] next one is 496. Then after that it gets
[1:00:05] up to in the
[1:00:07] millions and millions. They've only
[1:00:10] found 51 perfect numbers in all of the
[1:00:12] numbers. And the last one was discovered
[1:00:14] in 2008 and it has 49 million digits at
[1:00:17] the end of it. And that's the 51st
[1:00:20] number that. So the these numbers are
[1:00:22] not common numbers like they're just
[1:00:24] laying all over the place. Okay. that.
[1:00:26] But six is a perfect number. That's what
[1:00:30] they what they call a perfect number.
[1:00:31] And I I think when God made man, he made
[1:00:34] man
[1:00:35] perfect. He made a he made man, he he
[1:00:37] was
[1:00:38] so he he at the end of his creation, he
[1:00:42] made man on the sixth day and he made
[1:00:43] him perfect. He because he was the he
[1:00:45] was the the the the climax of all his
[1:00:49] creation was man. He made the the cows
[1:00:51] and the sheep and all these other
[1:00:53] things, but you know, he got things got
[1:00:54] better and better until he finally got
[1:00:56] to man and he thought, "This is
[1:00:57] perfect." And he could stop. He's, you
[1:01:00] know, when you do a job and at the end,
[1:01:01] you think, man, I'm I've done actually
[1:01:03] this is really good. This is complete.
[1:01:04] And then we stopped. When he made man,
[1:01:07] he was he thought this is complete and
[1:01:08] he stopped because he made man perfect.
[1:01:11] So next time you think of the number
[1:01:12] six, claim it for yourself. Think Lord,
[1:01:14] you made me perfect. You made man
[1:01:16] perfect. I don't care if Satan tries to
[1:01:18] claim it. It's my number.
[1:01:20] You made me perfect. You know, and it
[1:01:21] makes sense, too, cuz God's ways are
[1:01:24] passed our ways. Like number seven,
[1:01:25] number seven is God's number. That's
[1:01:26] actually hard to figure out. Like on
[1:01:29] your hands, you can you can divide up
[1:01:31] all of the people can't understand why
[1:01:33] seven's such a weird number, but they
[1:01:35] like on your hands, you can divide you
[1:01:36] can do two and two or three and three or
[1:01:39] one and one or like four and four. And
[1:01:42] if you want to do nine, you can do
[1:01:44] three, three and three. But seven you
[1:01:47] can't do. It's all weird. You can't
[1:01:50] really do it with, you know, five and
[1:01:52] two or six and one. It's like an unusual
[1:01:55] number. It's just, it sort of just
[1:01:56] stands alone. And all those numbers, it
[1:01:57] kind of it kind of stands
[1:02:01] alone. Um, in terms of the sixth day,
[1:02:04] man actually is the only one that's got
[1:02:05] a six sense as well. Like we actually,
[1:02:09] science says there's five, but we have a
[1:02:10] sixth sense called faith. And that's how
[1:02:12] we contact God is with our sixth sense.
[1:02:14] And because that's the number of man,
[1:02:15] and that's the way we can contact God.
[1:02:17] And the Bible has 66 books. I often
[1:02:19] wonder why because I thought six was a
[1:02:20] bad number. I thought that's weird. It's
[1:02:22] got 66. But it's actually made for man,
[1:02:24] man and woman. Six and six made for us.
[1:02:27] God gave the the word. He didn't make
[1:02:29] the word of God for animals or for
[1:02:31] himself. He already knew his own word.
[1:02:32] He made it for man. His word was made
[1:02:34] for man. That's why there's well, I
[1:02:36] don't know if that's why, but there's 66
[1:02:37] books. And I'll take it for man. We
[1:02:40] don't like the number six because it
[1:02:41] talks about the mark of the beast. And
[1:02:42] it says his name is the number of a man
[1:02:45] which is
[1:02:47] 666. And that come and this is one
[1:02:50] concept on it that the I won't actually
[1:02:52] read that because it doesn't really mean
[1:02:53] it but it it doesn't matter about that.
[1:02:56] This is the pope's crown. The way that
[1:02:58] we get to 666 is there's a there's a
[1:03:02] phrase in Latin. It's vicarious fely day
[1:03:07] and that that essentially means um and
[1:03:10] apparently it's on this crown here
[1:03:12] written on there and it says uh means a
[1:03:15] substitute for the son of God. And the
[1:03:17] the way that we get to 666 on this is we
[1:03:20] use the Roman numeral. So if it's like a
[1:03:22] V, it's five. and V and U in the old
[1:03:26] Latin were the same. They were all just
[1:03:27] a V, right? So if there's a V or a C or
[1:03:31] anything, then they've changed it to
[1:03:33] Roman to the Roman numerals. And then
[1:03:36] when you add it all up, that's how you
[1:03:38] get 666. So that's that's one theory on
[1:03:42] okay, using the Roman numerals and using
[1:03:43] the name. That's how they got to 666 in
[1:03:46] that one.
[1:03:48] Um I want to show you something in
[1:03:50] Genesis 1 in the Hebrew numerical value
[1:03:54] because the Hebrew um language is a
[1:03:57] numbering system as well. So it has
[1:03:59] numbers as well. So the the first verse
[1:04:01] in Genesis says in the beginning God
[1:04:03] created the heavens and the earth. In
[1:04:04] the Hebrew it's seven letters words but
[1:04:07] they go they read backwards the other
[1:04:09] way. And there are 28 letters in there
[1:04:14] and that's a yeah 28 is good. 28 47s,
[1:04:19] right? And when you add all the numbers
[1:04:21] up, it comes to 2701. And you think, oh,
[1:04:24] it doesn't really mean much.
[1:04:26] 271. There's this idea that these guys
[1:04:30] looked into it a lot, and they seem to
[1:04:31] think that in the that the universe is
[1:04:33] made up of 37 and 73. Like there's it's
[1:04:36] just littered everywhere. There's these
[1:04:37] two numbers that seem to just be in be
[1:04:40] everywhere. The number 37 and number 73,
[1:04:42] which is God's number, seven and three
[1:04:43] and three and seven.
[1:04:46] You can look into it more if you
[1:04:48] want. If you take two, so 271 is 37 *
[1:04:54] 73. Okay, you think, oh, that's yeah,
[1:04:56] that's coincidence. Okay. And then they
[1:04:59] found that if you mirror the number 271,
[1:05:02] you mirror it back the other way, 1702,
[1:05:04] add those together, you get 3773 as
[1:05:06] well, which you think, oh, that's
[1:05:07] another coincidence. But the first
[1:05:09] 10,000 numbers don't do this. This is
[1:05:11] the only number in 10,000 numbers that
[1:05:12] do this. is 2701. You they they've tried
[1:05:16] 10,000 numbers. I think they got sick of
[1:05:18] trying after that. But the first 10,000
[1:05:20] numbers don't create the scenario where
[1:05:24] your the amount amount your time is up
[1:05:25] by is this amount you add it up by,
[1:05:28] right? I It doesn't surprise me if God
[1:05:31] made things like this. You know, when
[1:05:32] you look under a microscope at little
[1:05:33] things, you and and that thing's been
[1:05:36] there since creation, but no one's ever
[1:05:37] seen it cuz someone finally got a
[1:05:39] microscope to look at and think, "Wow,
[1:05:40] look at that." you know, God just left
[1:05:42] it there the whole time, you know, until
[1:05:43] they got a little microscope and saw a
[1:05:45] little design or something to realize,
[1:05:46] wow, that's God. Maybe that's something
[1:05:47] like this. In the King James Bible,
[1:05:50] there's also numerical patterns in there
[1:05:51] as well. But one guy, one guy went to
[1:05:54] the uh t did the tedious job of adding
[1:05:57] up
[1:06:00] everything, including the title, the
[1:06:03] Holy Bible, King James version. Then he
[1:06:06] added up the all of the how many uh
[1:06:09] verses there were the names of the
[1:06:11] chapters like chapter one are two and
[1:06:14] the verse so verse 1 2 3 4 then that's
[1:06:17] four counts um everything he added it up
[1:06:22] and he found that it added to 8
[1:06:26] uh
[1:06:29] 823543 which is 7 * 7 exactly get your
[1:06:33] calculator out do it that's what it
[1:06:36] I don't know, unusual coincidence, I
[1:06:38] don't know, but it only takes one word
[1:06:40] to be out. But you've got 7*
[1:06:44] 7. And then in the King James Bible, the
[1:06:47] son of man is 196 times, which is 49 *
[1:06:49] 4. Remember, 49 is 7* 7. Jesus Christ is
[1:06:53] 196 times, which is 49* 4. The word of
[1:06:55] God is 49 times. Son of God is 49 times
[1:06:58] in the Old Testament. Uh in the New
[1:07:00] Testament, most high is 49 times.
[1:07:04] The word of the lord is 245 times which
[1:07:07] is 49 * 5. The word is seven times.
[1:07:09] Husbandman is seven times. My beloved
[1:07:11] son is seven times. His son seven times.
[1:07:13] Firstborn seven times. The word seven
[1:07:15] times in the new testament. It is
[1:07:17] written 63 times in the new testament 7*
[1:07:20] 9. Jesus and grace 49 times in the same
[1:07:22] verse. Remember seven sevens are 49.
[1:07:26] Holy spirit seven times. Breath 42
[1:07:28] times. Thunders seven times. God of
[1:07:31] Israel seven
[1:07:32] times 29 the church 77 times kingdom of
[1:07:37] God 70 times uh assembly 49 times the
[1:07:40] bride 14 times first fruit seven times
[1:07:44] daughters of Zion 28 times seven times
[1:07:46] four daughters of Jerusalem seven
[1:07:49] times daughters of Jerusalem seven times
[1:07:52] it goes on and on kinsmen seven times
[1:07:55] worshippers seven times workmanship
[1:07:56] seven times I think there becomes too
[1:07:58] many to become a coincidence after a
[1:08:01] Well, so that brings us to lucky number
[1:08:04] seven. Have you heard that saying? Lucky
[1:08:07] number seven. Do you know
[1:08:09] why?
[1:08:10] Science. If you're ever going to if
[1:08:13] you're ever planning on going gambling
[1:08:14] to a casino, pick seven. If there's two
[1:08:16] dice, right? Not that you're going to,
[1:08:19] but seven's seven's got the highest
[1:08:22] proportion of chance to be picked above
[1:08:24] any other number. Like if if you've got
[1:08:25] two dice, there's only one chance of
[1:08:28] shaking a two, which is two ones.
[1:08:30] So you So there's 36 36 options in the
[1:08:33] whole dice you can get
[1:08:35] um well no less than that but if you if
[1:08:39] you shake a dice you've got 1 2 3 4 5
[1:08:41] six chances of rolling a seven one
[1:08:43] chance of getting a two or one chance of
[1:08:45] getting a
[1:08:46] 12. So that's why they call it lucky
[1:08:48] number seven because scientifically
[1:08:49] you've got more chance of getting seven
[1:08:51] if you roll two dices than any other
[1:08:53] number even more than eight. Eight
[1:08:54] you've got five. Eight and six you've
[1:08:57] got five. each seven you've got six. So
[1:09:00] that's why they call it lucky number
[1:09:01] seven.
[1:09:04] Um it's also lucky in um Japan have
[1:09:07] seven gods. They like the number seven.
[1:09:09] Uh China love the number seven uh
[1:09:11] because it's
[1:09:13] pronounced chi which is you know you
[1:09:16] know people try and be sort
[1:09:19] of when we say other words that we don't
[1:09:21] know what they mean. We think they are a
[1:09:22] big word like we say oh there's goodqi
[1:09:24] from the south. I was doing a job in
[1:09:26] Gizbborne. You've heard good chi chi. I
[1:09:29] mean I was doing a job in Gizbborne and
[1:09:31] the the lady wanted her bed to face a
[1:09:34] certain way because she said, "Oh,
[1:09:35] there's goodq chi from that
[1:09:38] direction." Like chi is like just the
[1:09:40] Chinese word chi and it's means like uh
[1:09:44] life or energy or something. You know,
[1:09:46] she could have just said it was good
[1:09:47] energy from that way. But if you say
[1:09:48] chi, it's like oh it's this mysterious
[1:09:50] thing. It's I don't want to downplay it,
[1:09:52] but that's like when we say the word
[1:09:53] logos, we think we're clever, but it's
[1:09:55] like it's you're just saying word. Just
[1:09:57] say word,
[1:09:59] you know, like but chi. Soq chi means
[1:10:02] like uh chi and that's the same that's
[1:10:05] the number seven is chi as well. So the
[1:10:08] Chinese love the number seven and and a
[1:10:10] guy there's a there's a website called
[1:10:13] like numbers.com or something and they
[1:10:14] they put out a worldwide poll to pick
[1:10:16] what's the most favorite number in the
[1:10:18] whole world. Uh the the third favorite
[1:10:21] number was number eight. Second favorite
[1:10:24] number was number two. And the most
[1:10:25] favorite number in the world is number
[1:10:27] seven. It's just a Do you like the
[1:10:29] number seven?
[1:10:31] It's just I don't know whether it's
[1:10:35] because I don't know if the number seven
[1:10:37] is so prominent because of Christianity
[1:10:38] that people like it because of this or
[1:10:40] if it's just something about seven we
[1:10:41] just like. But it's an unusual number
[1:10:43] when you think about it. It's different
[1:10:44] than all the other numbers. Like eight
[1:10:46] is like two fours.
[1:10:48] Five is quite small. Nine is a bit too
[1:10:51] close to 10, but seven is like it's a
[1:10:55] weird number. It sits in the middle.
[1:10:56] It's a funny it's an unusual number.
[1:10:58] It's God's main number actually is
[1:10:59] number seven. And it means
[1:11:03] completion. There's so many things in
[1:11:04] the Bible about seven. There's seven
[1:11:06] days of creation. The sevenfold
[1:11:07] vengeance for Cain. Seven- day warning
[1:11:09] to Noah. Seven years of plenty. You got
[1:11:11] seven years of famine. Seven feasts.
[1:11:13] Seven times compassing Jericho. Seven
[1:11:15] priests. Seven trumpets. Says the
[1:11:16] seventh day. Uh, seven locks on Samson's
[1:11:19] head, the seven times dipping in the
[1:11:22] Jordan, um, seven times a day praising
[1:11:24] the Lord, seven pillars of wisdom, seven
[1:11:26] loaves and seven baskets, seven times
[1:11:28] forgiveness, or there's the other one,
[1:11:29] forgive him, 70* 7. Um, seven churches
[1:11:34] in the book of Revelation or seven
[1:11:36] church ages, seven seals, seven
[1:11:37] trumpets, seven vials, seven stars,
[1:11:39] seven candlesticks, seven horns, seven
[1:11:41] eyes, and seven spirits of God. There's
[1:11:44] seven everywhere. That's God's number.
[1:11:46] Uh, we got seven
[1:11:49] days. This number here is an unusual
[1:11:51] one, eight, because 8 represents
[1:11:54] eternity if you're in God's economy,
[1:11:56] right? I'll show you what I mean by
[1:11:58] that. So, this that we we get this idea
[1:12:00] from the eighth being the eighth day.
[1:12:02] So, the Jew the the there are all these
[1:12:05] feasts throughout the year or or
[1:12:06] occasions that the Jews have. Maybe I'll
[1:12:09] go to this one
[1:12:11] here. I'll go that one. It sort of shows
[1:12:13] it more. You've got the feast of
[1:12:14] Passover. Then you've got the you've got
[1:12:16] the Passover, you got unleven bread,
[1:12:17] you've got the first fruits which is 49
[1:12:19] weeks, then
[1:12:21] Pentecost after that. And then you got
[1:12:23] the trumpets, the day of atonement, and
[1:12:24] the tabernacles. So all up these
[1:12:26] actually are seven major feasts
[1:12:29] throughout the year. You know, it's
[1:12:30] numbered
[1:12:32] uh down the bottom here. Yeah. 1 2 3 4 5
[1:12:37] 6 7. So you've got seven major ones.
[1:12:40] It's at the end of the seventh one, the
[1:12:43] Lord says and on the eighth day you to
[1:12:46] be a holy com convocation. It's like but
[1:12:49] that always but because God's numbers
[1:12:50] just go in a circle because he has no
[1:12:53] time. His ones just go around and
[1:12:54] around. Then eight represents one again
[1:12:57] cuz it's just it just keeps going
[1:12:58] around. So the eight day is just it
[1:13:00] represents eternity because it's like
[1:13:01] just go back to the start and get
[1:13:02] around. Right? That's what that's why we
[1:13:04] say eight represents a new beginning.
[1:13:06] It's eternity. something because it's
[1:13:09] looping. I'll show you that in a bit.
[1:13:11] But God's when you understand eternity,
[1:13:13] eternity just loops. Numbers don't just
[1:13:15] go out that way forever and back that
[1:13:17] way forever. They just go around like 1
[1:13:20] 2 3 4 5 6 7 around around or the the
[1:13:22] months of the year go around, right? Uh
[1:13:25] the eighth day, Jesus rose essentially
[1:13:26] on the eighth day because the eighth day
[1:13:28] is Sunday because it's the first day of
[1:13:30] the week, which is which then is the
[1:13:33] eighth day cuz it's it's just eight is
[1:13:35] just one. It's it's all over again. So
[1:13:37] Jesus showed he rose on the eighth day.
[1:13:39] Um the day of Pentecost was the eighth
[1:13:42] day. This is showing like like eternity,
[1:13:44] right? Because when Jesus rose, eternity
[1:13:47] hooked in. Pentecost was actually the
[1:13:49] eighth day because you've got 49 days
[1:13:51] from the Passover and then the 50th day
[1:13:54] is the is a new day, right? 50th day is
[1:13:57] the first day again because you got
[1:13:59] seven sevens of 49. The 50th day just
[1:14:00] starts all over again. So that's what
[1:14:03] because the day of Pentecost is 50 days
[1:14:04] after Passover and that's when the Holy
[1:14:06] Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost which
[1:14:08] is which is 8. The new heavens and the
[1:14:10] new earth are essentially on the eighth
[1:14:12] day as well because you've got the earth
[1:14:13] was 6,000 years. We have a thousand-y
[1:14:15] year millennium. Then we get the new
[1:14:17] heavens and new earth on day one again
[1:14:18] or day eight, right? Eight represents
[1:14:21] eternity like that. Solomon when he did
[1:14:24] when he dedicated the temple it says um
[1:14:27] and at the time Solomon held a feast in
[1:14:29] all Israel with him a great congregation
[1:14:30] from the entering of Hamoth into the
[1:14:32] river of Egypt before the Lord our God
[1:14:34] seven days and seven days even he did it
[1:14:36] for 14 days on the eighth day he sent
[1:14:38] the people away and they blessed the
[1:14:39] king and went to their tents joyful and
[1:14:41] glad of heart for all the goodness that
[1:14:43] the Lord had done for David his servant
[1:14:44] and for Israel his people on the eighth
[1:14:46] day they were just really happy
[1:14:48] everyone's happy on the eighth day
[1:14:50] because it's the beginning of eternity
[1:14:52] the eighth day. Now this one is you
[1:14:55] think oh this I this is simple but when
[1:14:57] you talk about the concept of zero zero
[1:15:00] is a weird number because it's not
[1:15:01] actually a number it's a it's an idea
[1:15:05] right and and this concept of absolute
[1:15:07] zero is like it's a we we we take for
[1:15:10] granted the fact that we have zero but
[1:15:12] for zero is only something that's come
[1:15:14] of late this idea of zero like the Roman
[1:15:16] numerals didn't have a zero because they
[1:15:17] didn't have this concept of zero God
[1:15:19] doesn't really have zeros either he he I
[1:15:22] know we have nothing like I've got a
[1:15:24] thing in my hand and I take away I got
[1:15:25] nothing. There's a concept of nothing
[1:15:27] but but the idea in itself is an
[1:15:30] abstract idea of this concept of zero.
[1:15:32] So um I just want to show you the
[1:15:35] history of it because this is this is
[1:15:37] essentially it describes humanity and
[1:15:40] eternity. This concept of zero
[1:15:43] um in the this is this is going way back
[1:15:47] 200 AD. the the um Hindus and those
[1:15:50] their religions had this concept of
[1:15:53] we're in nothingness, you know, like a
[1:15:56] you know like like new age there's just
[1:15:58] nothing. So they had this concept of
[1:16:00] nothing. So they started thinking oh
[1:16:01] there must be a number that's
[1:16:03] nothing cuz cuz because the Christians
[1:16:06] said no there's no such thing as
[1:16:07] nothing. God's everywhere so there's
[1:16:09] just one right. Um and then that passed
[1:16:12] on to these guys. So uh mathematicians
[1:16:15] started using the concept of zero in
[1:16:17] their
[1:16:19] uh Indian mathematicians started having
[1:16:21] this concept of zero and started kind of
[1:16:22] working out a bit of a decimal more
[1:16:24] place having a zero at the end which
[1:16:25] essentially is just a 10 the other way
[1:16:27] just looping but but you have to but
[1:16:29] I'll show you what I mean in a bit
[1:16:31] because you when you have a beginning
[1:16:32] and end you have to have a zero but if
[1:16:34] you got no beginning no end you got no
[1:16:36] zero because it just goes around right
[1:16:38] so you don't need a zero like God
[1:16:40] doesn't need zero because it just goes
[1:16:42] around we have a start and then we need
[1:16:45] a zero. Right? So this
[1:16:47] guy this guy um he was from um Iraq. He
[1:16:52] worked out a whole numbering system
[1:16:54] based on a zero. This is like 900 AD. So
[1:16:56] this is we've gone way past the Roman
[1:16:58] time and way into the time we know. And
[1:17:01] you might know this person
[1:17:03] Fibonacci mathematician. So so he would
[1:17:06] travel to um Iraq and trade and things
[1:17:08] like that. And that's when he saw that
[1:17:11] oh what's this numbering system you guys
[1:17:12] have got? Oh, it's a what's a zero? What
[1:17:14] what are these decimal places? This was
[1:17:16] a new concept to him. So, he brought
[1:17:17] that back to Europe and then showed
[1:17:18] Europe, oh, there's a zero. We can do
[1:17:20] now decimals and things like that. And
[1:17:22] that that essentially opened up
[1:17:24] mathematics when you understood zero
[1:17:26] because before that, if you didn't have
[1:17:27] zero, you can't really go far with your
[1:17:28] numbers. You can't go backwards. You
[1:17:30] can't do decimal places, right? Because
[1:17:32] it is a placeholder, but it's also a
[1:17:34] negative thing. And then then all of our
[1:17:35] computers now are the binary code is now
[1:17:38] one zero which is something nothing
[1:17:41] something
[1:17:42] nothing right
[1:17:44] um but still the Greeks didn't accept
[1:17:47] this concept of zero because they
[1:17:49] thought how can nothing be
[1:17:51] something right like they they they sort
[1:17:53] of refuse it for a long time no there
[1:17:55] can't be because philosophically it's
[1:17:56] not possible something nothing can't be
[1:17:59] something it's either something or it's
[1:18:00] nothing if it's nothing then it doesn't
[1:18:02] exist so we're not going to make it
[1:18:03] exist because it's
[1:18:04] Nothing confusing, eh? You didn't think
[1:18:07] zero was so confusing, did you? But it's
[1:18:09] not even a number. It's not a number.
[1:18:11] It's like, what is it? People don't
[1:18:13] really know what it is. And there's this
[1:18:15] concept of absolute zero like like on
[1:18:17] the on the scales here. Listen to what
[1:18:18] this guy says. He says on a th Celsius
[1:18:21] thermometer, the number zero rests
[1:18:22] midway down the number line, but the but
[1:18:24] he said the true zero point of
[1:18:25] temperature, commonly known as absolute
[1:18:28] zero, is a staggering -273°.
[1:18:31] Now he says absolute zero like so much
[1:18:32] of the void remains tantalizingly out of
[1:18:35] reach for humanity. As Stuart explains,
[1:18:38] the laws of thermodynamics simply won't
[1:18:39] allow us to get there. So if you're on
[1:18:41] absolute zero, you'll never get there.
[1:18:42] You cannot get to absolute zero. He says
[1:18:48] um he says in principle you can get as
[1:18:50] close as you like to absolute zero but
[1:18:52] you can never actually get there because
[1:18:54] he says if you have a system which is in
[1:18:56] its zero energy state it has to be
[1:18:58] totally out of contact with the rest of
[1:19:00] the
[1:19:02] universe. So if you want to get to
[1:19:04] absolute zero you've got to be outside
[1:19:05] of this whole universe as we know it
[1:19:07] because any little bit of vibration or
[1:19:09] anything is going to make that not
[1:19:11] absolute zero. So you've got to become
[1:19:13] this all has to cease to exist then you
[1:19:15] get zero.
[1:19:17] So he's saying we can get as close to it
[1:19:19] in principle as we can to try and get
[1:19:21] freeze get things down and get all the
[1:19:22] vibrations out but we'll never ever get
[1:19:24] to absolute zero because we live in a
[1:19:26] world where there's something
[1:19:29] right
[1:19:33] and but this is what math can do and it
[1:19:38] sort of proves that God created the
[1:19:39] world is that zero actually means
[1:19:41] nothing and in
[1:19:43] numbers something can be added to
[1:19:45] nothing. You can have 0 plus one you
[1:19:47] equal one.
[1:19:48] So in math you can have zero then
[1:19:51] something which essentially was what we
[1:19:55] had that's why I say zero means uh
[1:19:58] mortal cuz because if you're just going
[1:20:00] round and round you don't need a zero do
[1:20:02] you just go 1 2 3 4 5 if you got
[1:20:04] increments of 10 you just go back to one
[1:20:06] again or the eighth day is just one goes
[1:20:08] round because you got no start no end
[1:20:10] you don't need it we need when you have
[1:20:12] a start of something you got to have a
[1:20:14] then then you've got to have a
[1:20:17] uh start point then you've got to have a
[1:20:19] point before that was nothing. If you
[1:20:22] have a see zero only exists in our realm
[1:20:24] because we we we get we be born we're
[1:20:26] like well one day I was born before that
[1:20:28] where was I was nothing so I was zero or
[1:20:33] you know we have we our minds have to
[1:20:35] have us oh the world had to begin
[1:20:37] somewhere if we're traveling through it
[1:20:38] had to begin somewhere where did it
[1:20:39] begin we we look down time that way we
[1:20:41] look up that way how far does it go that
[1:20:42] way how far back does it go and where is
[1:20:44] zero and and we say oh zero was the big
[1:20:48] bang you know not we but you know they
[1:20:50] say Okay, there was a time where there
[1:20:52] was nothing zero and then it went then
[1:20:56] we started cuz cuz if you have a start
[1:20:58] of some you have to have a
[1:21:00] zero but we say well no our concept is
[1:21:03] yes that's true but there was a time
[1:21:05] where there was nothing and then God
[1:21:08] said and created something so there was
[1:21:11] zero then there was something zero
[1:21:13] actually proves that God made the world
[1:21:14] that there was there was nothing then
[1:21:16] there's something that does that make
[1:21:18] sense I've got that one there actually.
[1:21:21] Yeah. But in eternity, it just goes
[1:21:24] around. There's no zero. You don't need
[1:21:25] zero. Like cuz we think, well, how far
[1:21:27] ahead the numbers go? They just keep
[1:21:29] going. God's not that confusing. He
[1:21:31] said, "No, they just go around." Yeah.
[1:21:33] Like cuz there'd be no end that way.
[1:21:35] It'd be confusing. Where's the end of
[1:21:37] it? It's into some black dark abyss
[1:21:38] somewhere. They just go around. Eternity
[1:21:41] just goes around like seven. It just
[1:21:43] goes back to one or eight.
[1:21:46] Okay. Uh here is what happens when you
[1:21:48] put five plus zero because zero is just
[1:21:51] like a placeholder now like if you have
[1:21:53] zero and you put one thing in it it's
[1:21:55] one but then if you uh fun fact children
[1:21:58] if you try and so if you have 500 * 0
[1:22:01] then equals 0. If you have 500 plus 0,
[1:22:04] it's 500 or 500 takeway 0 is 500. But if
[1:22:07] you put um 500 divided by 0, you get
[1:22:10] error because it's like how do I divide
[1:22:12] something by nothing? And that your
[1:22:15] computer every calculator goes don't
[1:22:18] know because zero is not actually a
[1:22:20] number. It's a nothing. It's a nothing.
[1:22:25] Right? You understand zero? Confusing
[1:22:28] concept. E you didn't know it was so
[1:22:30] confusing. We just take for granted it's
[1:22:31] a zero. But it's but it actually proves
[1:22:34] God because God doesn't have zero
[1:22:36] actually there is going to be a time
[1:22:37] where time is no more and all the stuff
[1:22:39] and all evil is zero. Zero nothing.
[1:22:43] They're all going to be zeroed out. All
[1:22:45] evil hell in eternity. Hell is not just
[1:22:47] going to go on forever. There's all the
[1:22:49] stuff. There's going to be a time where
[1:22:50] it's going to be zero. Amen. Gone.
[1:22:54] Zero. And then we are just in eternity.
[1:22:58] We just go 1 through seven. 1 through
[1:23:00] seven. go round and round and
[1:23:02] round. I want to talk about 12 worship.
[1:23:05] Jacob had 12 sons. There were 12 sons of
[1:23:08] the they they became the 12 tribes of
[1:23:09] Israel. Moses sent out 12 tribes. Elijah
[1:23:12] built an altar of 12 stones. There were
[1:23:14] 12 minor prophets. Gods specified 12
[1:23:17] unleven breadcakes. Jesus had 12
[1:23:20] disciples. When Peter cut off the years
[1:23:22] of the defending Jesus, he said, "I
[1:23:24] could call down 12 legions of angels."
[1:23:26] Maybe that's how many he's got. The new
[1:23:29] Jerusalem has 12 gates and 12
[1:23:30] foundations. And the tree of life will
[1:23:32] be 12 fruit crops 12 times a year. Seven
[1:23:35] and 12 is numbers that God uses. And
[1:23:38] then in our in our u system, we've got
[1:23:41] 12 months of the year. And then we
[1:23:44] within that, this is our western one
[1:23:46] anyway because other cultures have
[1:23:47] theirs, but they still have 12. We've
[1:23:48] got 12 constellations in the zodiac that
[1:23:51] run through the one for each
[1:23:54] month. Music is the same. When you start
[1:23:57] to look at the music to color to
[1:23:59] anything there's you either got seven or
[1:24:01] 12 and sometimes five that's really all
[1:24:04] you've got in everything runs through
[1:24:06] all of God's creation like like music
[1:24:08] any musicians here what this is what we
[1:24:11] call the chromatic scale which is
[1:24:13] essentially which is
[1:24:15] essentially music are just vibrations
[1:24:17] you know so they there are only a
[1:24:20] certain amount of vibrations and then
[1:24:21] when you figure out what they are they
[1:24:22] just that's what it is you know it's
[1:24:24] just vibrates slower slower faster It's
[1:24:27] higher, but it just makes these certain
[1:24:28] pitches, you know, no matter what you do
[1:24:30] there, you know, just it just vibrates.
[1:24:32] So then they worked out, okay, there's
[1:24:34] pretty much when you work this out,
[1:24:36] there are 12 of these sounds. 12 main
[1:24:38] sounds. That's all there is. There are
[1:24:39] 12, which is on a piano, you've got
[1:24:42] that's what an octave looks
[1:24:44] like. And this is going to make music
[1:24:46] seem so boring to you that there's only
[1:24:48] 12. That's it. No more. There's
[1:24:50] variations, but there's only 12, right?
[1:24:52] And of those we only use seven because
[1:24:56] you know the you seen sound of music you
[1:24:58] know the do rei do rei do rei
[1:25:02] foli and then do is the start of the
[1:25:05] next one it's just like Monday Tuesday
[1:25:06] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
[1:25:07] Sunday it starts again there are seven
[1:25:10] that's all there is that's it there's
[1:25:13] either seven or 12
[1:25:15] that you can't find any anywhere else
[1:25:18] that's all there is because God made
[1:25:20] music and he made notes he made
[1:25:21] vibrations he He made it. There's 12
[1:25:23] there's 12 main bits and then you then
[1:25:25] there's seven is this chromatic scale,
[1:25:27] right? Which is this here. If you if
[1:25:29] you're looking at the piano, it's just
[1:25:30] one. If you're in middle C, don't worry.
[1:25:33] This just is what it is. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
[1:25:36] That's all your notes that exist. Every
[1:25:37] song is written pretty much with those
[1:25:39] ones. Three chords actually. The
[1:25:42] songs. And now a weird thing is is that
[1:25:45] the main ones that go together is number
[1:25:47] one, number four, number five. Most
[1:25:48] songs are one, four, and five. So it
[1:25:51] doesn't matter where on the scale you go
[1:25:52] because if you go down, you're just
[1:25:53] moving everything down, but you're
[1:25:55] playing the same thing. 1 145. You play
[1:25:57] it up here, it's 1 145. Don't matter
[1:25:59] where it goes, right? Can I just bore
[1:26:01] you a little bit more with this? You've
[1:26:02] got this thing called the circle of
[1:26:04] fifths. Okay. So if you if you use this
[1:26:07] scale here, 1 2 3 4 5, and you make a
[1:26:10] and then you go up the normal scale. If
[1:26:13] you go
[1:26:14] around, then you get what they call a
[1:26:16] circle of fifths, which is which if you
[1:26:18] go 12 times, you end up back at the
[1:26:20] start again. And then that's your whole
[1:26:23] that's that's music right there. And
[1:26:24] what that's done is that's kind of
[1:26:26] grouped in it's it's so strange, but
[1:26:28] it's grouped in the notes, the chords,
[1:26:30] the keys that work together, right? So
[1:26:32] if you're in the key of C, F is the
[1:26:34] fourth and G is the fifth. And so if
[1:26:37] you're playing C, just play F and G.
[1:26:39] They're probably going to go with it.
[1:26:40] And then there's a what we call a
[1:26:41] relative minor, which are the ones
[1:26:42] underneath, and they're all the same.
[1:26:44] Like a C would be a minor. So if you're
[1:26:46] playing an E, A would be the fourth, B
[1:26:49] would be the fifth. It's just this is
[1:26:51] just one big repeat. Who's heard that?
[1:26:53] There was a song came out of what we,
[1:26:55] the Gongios do, the another version, the
[1:26:56] Hallelujah song, you know, but they've
[1:26:58] put other words in. But if you've heard
[1:27:00] the original version, it says, I heard
[1:27:03] there was a secret chord that David
[1:27:04] played and it pleased the Lord. But you
[1:27:06] don't really care for music, do you?
[1:27:07] Okay, it's the first part. Then it says,
[1:27:10] well, it goes like this. You see the
[1:27:11] where I'm reading from? C. Well, it goes
[1:27:14] like this. The fourth, what's the fourth
[1:27:15] one up there? See the is F. The fifth is
[1:27:18] G, which is C. FG. The minor fall, which
[1:27:21] is A minor. Then back up to the major,
[1:27:23] F. And the major lift, the baffle king
[1:27:26] composing Hallelujah. This guy's just
[1:27:28] pretty much given the secret away to all
[1:27:30] music. That's pretty much it right
[1:27:32] there. That's every song we do here.
[1:27:34] Pretty much all of it is just that's it
[1:27:35] there. There's three chords. So, it's
[1:27:39] three, five, seven, 12. That's how music
[1:27:41] works. Color is very, very much the
[1:27:44] same. Um, you you know, you got the
[1:27:46] rainbow. You got seven colors in the
[1:27:47] rainbow. But there's actually like a
[1:27:50] gazillion colors there. But Isaac Newton
[1:27:52] was actually a Christian. He thought,
[1:27:53] "Now, I've got to make it seven cuz
[1:27:54] there's seven chords, uh, seven, you
[1:27:56] know, there's cuz he dis he essentially
[1:27:58] discovered it through the pyramid, but
[1:28:00] he said there's there's seven notes, so
[1:28:01] there's got to be seven colors in the
[1:28:03] rainbow that coincide with the
[1:28:04] seven musical notes." So, that's why
[1:28:07] there's actually seven cuz people always
[1:28:09] argue that um, indigo shouldn't be in
[1:28:12] there, but he put it in there, so it's
[1:28:15] seven. Uh, the
[1:28:17] um the pride flag only has six.
[1:28:19] Incidentally, they were going to do a
[1:28:21] pink and another one, but they the the
[1:28:23] dying color the cost to dye it was too
[1:28:25] expensive. So, they just cut it back to
[1:28:26] six to save money. So, they cut out the
[1:28:30] indigo and they were going to do a pink,
[1:28:32] but they took both of those out. So,
[1:28:34] that's why it's only six. But this is a
[1:28:37] color wheel. This is a seven color color
[1:28:40] wheel, which which you can make all
[1:28:41] colors from that. The the one that we
[1:28:43] use is the we call it the Martian color
[1:28:45] wheel, which is the one on the right,
[1:28:46] which is 12, which is three main colors.
[1:28:49] I think it's red, uh you got red, blue,
[1:28:54] um
[1:28:56] green. Yeah. Okay.
[1:28:58] So, now this is people haven't made this
[1:29:01] up. This is just how this stuff works.
[1:29:04] You've got So, I think it's red, yellow,
[1:29:07] blue. Okay? And you've got secondary
[1:29:10] colors, which you just mix those ones
[1:29:12] together and you get three secondary
[1:29:14] colors. Then you mix a secondary with a
[1:29:17] primary color and you get a tertiary
[1:29:18] color and you get another six. So you
[1:29:20] get 12 and that's it. They're like
[1:29:23] three. They they make all the colors.
[1:29:25] That's so there there are essentially
[1:29:27] this whole world's made with 12
[1:29:30] colors. Like that's what there is. They
[1:29:33] just make everything cuz God made color,
[1:29:35] you know, and he made light rays and
[1:29:37] it's all just vibrations and everything.
[1:29:38] It vibrates the same as music. And if
[1:29:41] you mix the seven main
[1:29:44] colors, it there's no color called
[1:29:46] white. White is just mixing all the
[1:29:47] colors together, then you get white,
[1:29:49] which I've always liked that. And
[1:29:50] there's no color called black. Black
[1:29:51] just means there's no light vibration.
[1:29:54] So the more you take away, the blacker
[1:29:56] it gets. Every color goes black. You
[1:29:58] just pull away. There's no there's no
[1:30:00] actual color black on the color
[1:30:01] spectrum. Doesn't exist. Or there's no
[1:30:03] white. That's why if you spin the color
[1:30:05] wheel fast, you start you see white
[1:30:09] because because your if you look at one
[1:30:12] spot, your mind can't process it fast
[1:30:14] enough and so it ends up because it's
[1:30:16] going so fast. It mixes all the colors
[1:30:17] together which when they all mix
[1:30:18] together they it becomes white. It's
[1:30:20] just how it works because they're all
[1:30:22] different light rays and they just add
[1:30:23] up to white. Is that not confusing?
[1:30:27] So then you've got this one and this is
[1:30:30] these are people look into this they
[1:30:31] think this is this is this is someone
[1:30:33] wrote this. He said it's interesting
[1:30:34] that there are 12 keys that progress in
[1:30:36] the circle of fifths through all the
[1:30:38] sharps and flats and come back again.
[1:30:40] They go through every note and likewise
[1:30:42] there are 12 major hues in the Martian
[1:30:44] color wheel that progresses through the
[1:30:45] blues, the greens, the reds and come
[1:30:47] back again more to the beginning. It's
[1:30:48] probably just a coincidence but one
[1:30:50] might as well make some use of it. It's
[1:30:52] not a coincidence God made it. He
[1:30:55] designed it this way. Okay, we we've
[1:30:56] just figured out, oh, this is how it
[1:30:57] works. Oh, there's seven. Oh, there's
[1:30:58] 12. Oh, there's
[1:31:00] three. Um, some people have
[1:31:04] this. I think they said about 4% of the
[1:31:06] of the population can actually hear a
[1:31:09] color. So, they hear a sound and they
[1:31:12] and a color comes with the sound. What's
[1:31:14] that brother in Christ Church that does
[1:31:15] all the Yeah, Marcus. So, he he's got
[1:31:18] this he he
[1:31:21] Nathaniel. Yeah. He he hears uh when he
[1:31:25] hears a sound, he a color associates
[1:31:27] with it. It's just a cuz they're kind of
[1:31:28] almost the same thing. They're just
[1:31:29] vibrations. It's just they don't
[1:31:31] actually don't know why it happens, but
[1:31:32] 4% of the population have this
[1:31:34] phenomenon where they they can hear
[1:31:36] colors. That'd be neat. Any of the
[1:31:38] musicians here, can you hear colors?
[1:31:40] Amateurs.
[1:31:44] No. Need to get a new band, man.
[1:31:49] Um then you've got the
[1:31:50] zodiac which is which are the 12
[1:31:54] constellations. So there's 12 again
[1:31:56] which which represent the 12 months of
[1:31:57] the year. It actually starts in Virgo
[1:31:59] where people say it starts in Aries you
[1:32:01] know but it's it's supposed to start in
[1:32:03] Virgo which is the virgin and go right
[1:32:06] through to then the last one is Leo
[1:32:08] which is the lion you know because it
[1:32:09] represents the Lord and his pathway that
[1:32:11] he took through. But to get even more
[1:32:13] confusing, then you can you they pretty
[1:32:15] much all combine. Like you got the
[1:32:16] musical notes, you've got the
[1:32:19] colors, you've got the
[1:32:22] um and you've got the um all the star
[1:32:26] signs and the the months of the year. It
[1:32:29] all kind of they all they
[1:32:31] all they all go together. And this is
[1:32:33] just one last thing to confuse you
[1:32:35] slightly more. We have what we call a
[1:32:38] seven it it's sort of scientifically
[1:32:40] proven that there's a seven-year cycle
[1:32:41] of life. Every seven years we
[1:32:43] change, right? It's just they don't know
[1:32:46] why, but they just think this is weird.
[1:32:48] We just change every seven years. We
[1:32:49] sort of get made over. We have seven,
[1:32:51] then 14, then 28, 35, 42, and we we all
[1:32:54] sort of just go through different phases
[1:32:56] as we go through these stages. Now, if
[1:32:58] you went on this, say this, this is the
[1:33:00] starstone. If you sat on each one, say
[1:33:02] you started off in um Virgo and you
[1:33:05] went, this is actually going the other
[1:33:07] way. If you went seven months on each
[1:33:09] one, then you'd be seven years to get
[1:33:11] round and then you'd start again. Just
[1:33:14] seven on the 12 is seven
[1:33:16] years. That's just how everything works.
[1:33:18] It's all sevens or twelves. And then
[1:33:21] that takes us through to these this
[1:33:25] planets that are that are that we
[1:33:26] probably don't even see much anymore cuz
[1:33:28] there's we get too much light pollution.
[1:33:29] We never go outside. We're always
[1:33:30] inside, but planets and stars and that
[1:33:33] were a big deal. And God said made
[1:33:35] planets for seasons and for times and to
[1:33:37] keep track of everything. It's just his
[1:33:38] it's his numbering system. It's his time
[1:33:40] system. The Babylonians knew of seven
[1:33:43] planets, but they called the moon and
[1:33:45] the sun a planet. And then they had
[1:33:48] Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Mercury, and
[1:33:49] Mars. So these are the ones you can see
[1:33:51] because the other ones, Pluto, uh, not
[1:33:53] Pluto, the other, um, Uranus and
[1:33:56] Neptune, you can't actually see with the
[1:33:58] naked eye. So that's why they they
[1:34:00] counted five plus the sun and the moon
[1:34:01] was seven. And they named their days of
[1:34:03] the week after the planets, which
[1:34:05] essentially everyone did. It was like
[1:34:07] it's how you numbered your weeks. What
[1:34:08] should we call them? I'll call them
[1:34:09] after the planets cuz there's seven
[1:34:11] planets there. Um
[1:34:14] the they had this was on um March the
[1:34:18] 25th, 185 BC. They had this time where
[1:34:21] because the planets all sort of rotate
[1:34:22] and sometimes they they line up in
[1:34:24] different ways. Sometimes they're far
[1:34:25] apart, sometimes they all come together.
[1:34:27] This one they all they were all in the
[1:34:29] same place down in the sky. So they
[1:34:31] would have probably had some sort of
[1:34:32] celebration there and looked out of
[1:34:33] these planets all lining up in the sky
[1:34:35] there. So our days of the week 1 2 3 4 5
[1:34:39] 6 7 are named after planets. You've got
[1:34:42] Sunday. They the Romans named these
[1:34:45] essentially named these after the names
[1:34:47] of the planets. So their one was Sunday.
[1:34:48] That's a sun
[1:34:50] uh but which is I'll read
[1:34:54] the Dominigo.
[1:34:57] Oh no, that's that's
[1:34:59] Spanish. D solles, which is the sun. D
[1:35:02] Luna, which is the moon. This is this is
[1:35:04] the Egyptian
[1:35:05] one.
[1:35:07] Um, D Martis, which is Mars. This is the
[1:35:10] Roman one, I mean. Um, D Mercury, which
[1:35:13] is Mercury, Dvis, Jupiter or Jovis, D
[1:35:19] Veneer, which is Venus, and D Saturn,
[1:35:21] which is Saturn, Saturday. Our ones come
[1:35:25] from we our ones come from the Nordic
[1:35:29] language because we were a little bit
[1:35:32] different. So we we kept Sunday and then
[1:35:34] we kept moon day Monday but then Tuesday
[1:35:37] instead of being um Mars we named it
[1:35:41] after Ty which was the god of war which
[1:35:43] is Ty. So we got Tyrus day Tuesday,
[1:35:47] right? And then Wednesday, we didn't use
[1:35:49] Mercury because we used our Norse
[1:35:51] people. They said, "No, we're not going
[1:35:52] to use your Roman gods. We'll use our
[1:35:54] gods." You know? So they had another
[1:35:56] god. This god was like Odin's. So it's
[1:35:59] like Odin's day or day. Um Thursday,
[1:36:03] you've heard of
[1:36:05] Thor. Okay. So that was the god of war
[1:36:07] because Jupiter was
[1:36:09] Thursday and Jupiter was like the the
[1:36:11] the the war planet, you know, the big
[1:36:13] one. Jupiter and but they said no we
[1:36:15] don't want that we're going to have Thor
[1:36:16] as our our guy so we're going to call it
[1:36:18] Thor Thor's day or Thursday that's how
[1:36:20] we get Thursday Friday was Venus which
[1:36:24] was the I guess the wife of Jupiter you
[1:36:27] know Venus is always a woman but they
[1:36:30] had a goddess called uh Friger or Freya
[1:36:33] it's the same word so that's how they
[1:36:35] got Friday so all of our all of our
[1:36:38] names are named after some Norse god so
[1:36:40] all of
[1:36:41] our Saturday they say that it was Saturn
[1:36:44] day, but I think Saturday in the North
[1:36:45] one was it was actually translated to do
[1:36:47] the washing day like wash your
[1:36:50] clothes, wash your clothes on Saturday.
[1:36:53] Now, it's funny
[1:36:55] because when we could see with our human
[1:36:57] eyes, we had the sun and the moon as a
[1:36:59] planet which made seven. But then we got
[1:37:00] telescopes and we realized, well, the
[1:37:01] sun's not a planet, the moon's not. Oh,
[1:37:03] there's another two. Oh, what are those
[1:37:05] ones? So, we ended up still with seven
[1:37:07] planets outside of our own, right? So
[1:37:10] even when we even when technology
[1:37:12] advanced, there was still seven major
[1:37:13] planets in our solar system. And I kind
[1:37:16] of like this that if we look out and we
[1:37:18] count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. What planet are we?
[1:37:22] Eight. And it's this one. This is where
[1:37:24] we're going to be that we live here. You
[1:37:26] know, this is going to be the one that's
[1:37:27] going to be eternal. This this planet,
[1:37:29] remember the eighth day eternal. We live
[1:37:31] on the eighth
[1:37:32] planet. I don't think that's a
[1:37:34] coincidence that cuz this our eighth
[1:37:35] planet's going to be here forever.
[1:37:38] Brother Brandham talked in 1962 about he
[1:37:41] said there was a he said what's happened
[1:37:43] we see a roar in the paper across the
[1:37:44] television out across the nations where
[1:37:46] five stars just fell in line with the
[1:37:47] world what's five a number of grace
[1:37:49] every time those stars come then
[1:37:50] something happens on earth what's taken
[1:37:52] place five stars fell in what was it an
[1:37:54] introduction of what since then just
[1:37:56] look at what's taken place Germany
[1:37:57] almost washed off the map some of the
[1:37:58] magi said that the world would burst
[1:38:01] like a watermelon and every distressful
[1:38:02] thing that's prophesied by them for the
[1:38:04] last days look what's taken place
[1:38:06] England the other day a storm that
[1:38:07] blowed away 7,000 houses one day.
[1:38:09] Disasters everywhere. California, Los
[1:38:11] Angeles is like to wash into the ocean.
[1:38:12] What is it? Beginning of sorrows.
[1:38:13] Earthquakes has picked up everywhere.
[1:38:15] Why is it five stars come in line?
[1:38:17] Grace, God's grace. What's happened? An
[1:38:19] infant church. Hallelujah. A bride
[1:38:21] infancy. That the power of God has begun
[1:38:23] to fall on her. She's she has taken form
[1:38:25] a bride for this bridegroom. That three
[1:38:28] stars meant his perfection of the
[1:38:29] heavenly father of the Trinity becoming
[1:38:31] one on earth among us. God's offices
[1:38:33] becoming one office. What happened now?
[1:38:34] It's the church of the living God coming
[1:38:36] together under the word of God and the
[1:38:38] astronomic heaven is announcing her
[1:38:40] approach. Amen. Might not be believing
[1:38:42] that but it's a word just the same. Yes
[1:38:44] sir. So in 1962 that was February there
[1:38:47] was a what they call a planetary
[1:38:48] alignment where the planets actually and
[1:38:51] the path that the that they take across
[1:38:53] the sky like there's a path and and
[1:38:55] alignment is when they all sort of end
[1:38:56] up because they're spinning all sorts of
[1:38:57] different ways they will end up on the
[1:38:58] same path. So for a moment it might be a
[1:39:00] day it looks like oh they're all on that
[1:39:02] same path like they're lined up along
[1:39:03] the path of the sun right they and
[1:39:06] that's what they call a planetary
[1:39:07] alignment when they all line up that's
[1:39:08] what they do. So on this day there were
[1:39:10] five planets that lined up and there was
[1:39:12] a total solar eclipse as well he said um
[1:39:16] and that's what he's talking about in
[1:39:18] that one that was in by 2:00 the road
[1:39:20] leading up to and from the observatory
[1:39:22] was a solid mass of cars lined up bumper
[1:39:24] to bumper for half a mile. One woman was
[1:39:26] weeping so badly it was hard to
[1:39:27] understand her. She was practically on
[1:39:29] the verge of collapse. I don't know. I
[1:39:31] know it's silly to carry on like this.
[1:39:33] She gasps between twins, but I can't
[1:39:34] help myself because we know something's
[1:39:37] happening when when things happen in the
[1:39:39] universe. We kind of just know cuz God
[1:39:40] has said these are for signs and for
[1:39:42] things, right? Um we just missed a big
[1:39:45] one. There was one in um uh February,
[1:39:49] 28th of February of this year, which was
[1:39:50] actually a seven planet alignment. Did
[1:39:52] anyone see it? I missed it. You did.
[1:39:56] Should have. we should have been
[1:39:58] watching. Um, which is this one here. It
[1:40:01] was on the 28th. You could sort of see
[1:40:02] it. I think you could see it. This one
[1:40:04] may have been in the morning. Um, but
[1:40:06] the last one was 1982 and the next one
[1:40:08] is going to be 2357. So, you won't see
[1:40:12] another one. If you missed it, you won't
[1:40:14] see it anymore. Four is quite common.
[1:40:16] Five less. And the seven is very
[1:40:18] uncommon, very rare. Um, so this year
[1:40:21] we're going to have um February 28th we
[1:40:24] had four. April 17th, which was just the
[1:40:27] other week, there were four. And then
[1:40:28] April the 10th, we're going to get one
[1:40:29] of six lining
[1:40:32] up on the in December 2020, they
[1:40:38] had they called this the Christmas star
[1:40:41] or like when when two planets they when
[1:40:44] they come so close together, they looks
[1:40:45] like they ver merged like one star. This
[1:40:48] one was between um Jupiter and Saturn.
[1:40:50] I'll just go along. So this is like
[1:40:52] November the 16th, November the 30th.
[1:40:55] December the
[1:40:56] 7th uh December the 14th and then on
[1:40:59] December the 21st they had come so close
[1:41:02] together that it was like it looked like
[1:41:04] one star and becomes a bright star and
[1:41:06] that's and it was around Christmas they
[1:41:07] called this a Christmas
[1:41:09] star. These things mean something like
[1:41:13] they don't just happen and there's no
[1:41:15] it's a coincidence.
[1:41:17] So the birth of Christ, there were the
[1:41:19] wise men that were looking to stars more
[1:41:22] than what we would now. And they were
[1:41:23] noticing things in the heavens and the
[1:41:25] planets doing certain things. This
[1:41:28] happened in 7 BC, which was Saturn and
[1:41:31] Jupiter in that
[1:41:33] year, three times throughout the year,
[1:41:36] May, September, and December, they all
[1:41:37] kind of they all pass each other quite
[1:41:39] close sort of to form under one of
[1:41:40] these.
[1:41:43] um in May. It looks like they're in the
[1:41:45] same place, but if you look at the other
[1:41:47] stars, they're moving westward, right?
[1:41:48] They're moving
[1:41:50] along. Does this play GIFs on
[1:41:55] here?
[1:41:58] Really? Okay. You have to trust me on
[1:42:01] this. This was August of 3 BC. This was
[1:42:06] Jupiter and Venus which is the mother
[1:42:10] which is the king the they came together
[1:42:13] like like that and then 10 months later
[1:42:16] they did it again and they and they did
[1:42:17] that with the with the star of um
[1:42:20] Regulus which is the king star in the in
[1:42:24] the um constellation of
[1:42:26] Leo. I wish I I I I actually have got it
[1:42:30] on my other
[1:42:33] um the video the the GIF is nice because
[1:42:34] they all come together and they
[1:42:35] basically come in. So this happened this
[1:42:38] happened in August. So it's kind of like
[1:42:40] the mother and father like the the
[1:42:41] Jupiter and Venus coming together with
[1:42:43] it with the king star there and it
[1:42:45] happened twice. once there and once once
[1:42:48] in 2 BC 10 months
[1:42:51] later
[1:42:52] and there was one other thing where the
[1:42:55] stars traveled westward and then they
[1:42:56] stopped at a certain place. Now people
[1:42:58] are saying that's what the wise men saw.
[1:43:00] They saw this thing happen in in 6 BC
[1:43:02] then they kept watching and then they
[1:43:03] saw this come together and that's why
[1:43:05] they said they went to Jerusalem and
[1:43:07] they said where is he that's born king
[1:43:08] of the Jews? Now we've seen his star in
[1:43:09] the east. We've come to find out where
[1:43:11] he is. He's announced his birth has been
[1:43:14] announced there. something's happened in
[1:43:15] the planets and we know there's
[1:43:16] something someone is turning up here.
[1:43:18] That's what they did. But if you were if
[1:43:22] you were even more spiritual than that,
[1:43:24] you could just use simple calculation
[1:43:26] and you knew times. You could just use
[1:43:28] simple calculation. You would know,
[1:43:30] okay, the Messiah is on earth. He's
[1:43:33] here. Because you could look in Daniel
[1:43:35] 70 weeks and you know that, okay, the
[1:43:38] Lord said cuz Israel, he always gives
[1:43:40] Israel a certain time time. The Gentiles
[1:43:43] just say until, but he's allocated the
[1:43:44] Jews, sorry, the Jews certain time
[1:43:47] periods. This is all the time you've
[1:43:48] got. And one of the time periods was he
[1:43:51] said, "You'll be given 70 weeks from
[1:43:52] when you from the commandment to rebuild
[1:43:54] the the um the temple like the
[1:43:59] walls until the Messiah comes will be 69
[1:44:03] weeks. Then he'll prophesy for 3 and 1/2
[1:44:06] week uh for half a week, which is 3 and
[1:44:09] 1/2 years. he'll get cut off and then
[1:44:11] you'll get another three and a half
[1:44:12] years at the end where they come back.
[1:44:14] So that's how you go 69 plus 3 and a
[1:44:16] half plus three and a half right that's
[1:44:18] what they get. Okay.
[1:44:21] So then if you go to
[1:44:25] um if you just simple bit of research
[1:44:28] you can easily find out when this guy
[1:44:30] was um Arturaxis or his name was king he
[1:44:34] was from the Bible King Atherus. The
[1:44:37] Bible says in the 20th year of his reign
[1:44:39] then he gave a commandment to that he
[1:44:42] can go and build the walls of the temple
[1:44:43] again.
[1:44:44] Right? So the 20th he was he he came he
[1:44:48] started reigning in 465
[1:44:51] BC. So then that would mean it would be
[1:44:54] 446
[1:44:56] BC was when the commandment went forth.
[1:44:59] So you just go
[1:45:02] 69 times like one year is one year is
[1:45:07] seven years right because it's a a week
[1:45:09] seven. So you go do you understand
[1:45:11] that 69 one when he says one one week
[1:45:15] that means seven years so you go 69 * 7
[1:45:18] is 360 and then but they times 360
[1:45:22] because the Jewish calendar is only 360
[1:45:24] days but our our one is 360.25
[1:45:28] 25 for the leap year, right? So, we have
[1:45:30] to do that little calculation. Just
[1:45:32] trust me, it works. That's it there. So,
[1:45:34] you go 446 to 4 plus 476, you end up at
[1:45:37] 30 AD. So, you could have been there in
[1:45:39] that time and just worked out a simple
[1:45:41] calculation and going, "Right, okay. If
[1:45:42] I believe the Bible, the Messiah is
[1:45:44] here. Where is he?" Like, he's on Earth.
[1:45:46] We calculated he's here. And he was. I
[1:45:50] mean, it's it's not it's not
[1:45:53] um there's only one problem with these
[1:45:55] numbers, though. I'm about a year out
[1:45:57] because
[1:45:58] um he Jesus was crucified on a Friday
[1:46:02] and he rose on a Sunday and the only two
[1:46:04] times he could have been
[1:46:06] were Friday the 7th of April in 30 AD or
[1:46:10] Friday the 3rd of April in
[1:46:15] AD.33. I'll explain to you why the what
[1:46:18] the problem is here. But it kind of does
[1:46:21] work because
[1:46:23] 446 BC plus a 476 gets you to 30 AD 3
[1:46:27] and a half years because he pro he
[1:46:28] prophesied for three and a half years
[1:46:30] then he was crucified. So that gets you
[1:46:32] to that actually gets you to June. But
[1:46:35] this one is April. He was crucified in
[1:46:38] April.
[1:46:40] Um this is just to throw us little
[1:46:42] spanner in the works.
[1:46:45] Um he was Jesus was either born in Aries
[1:46:50] lies a lamb right that's over under that
[1:46:53] sign but there's a bigger argument that
[1:46:56] he was born over in Virgo which is
[1:46:58] virgin
[1:47:00] September now none of us were there so
[1:47:03] we don't really know but and this is not
[1:47:06] this is not foundational you're saved if
[1:47:07] you believe it's here you're not saved
[1:47:08] if you believe it's here doesn't it
[1:47:09] doesn't really matter but if he was born
[1:47:12] and Aries and both the shepherds would
[1:47:16] have been out both times of the year
[1:47:18] because it's the same time. It's just
[1:47:20] either side of summer, right? So, both
[1:47:21] work and both star signs work like he
[1:47:25] came from a virgin or he was a lamb of
[1:47:26] God. Both work. But if he was born in
[1:47:29] Aries there, then he would have been 34
[1:47:31] when he died, not
[1:47:34] 33. You happy with that? It's the only
[1:47:37] problem you got because if he did if he
[1:47:39] he can't start ministering till he's 30
[1:47:41] then if he goes three and a half
[1:47:43] years he has to go another he had to
[1:47:46] have started ministry at like halfway
[1:47:49] through he had to if he was he had to
[1:47:51] have started when he was 30 and a half
[1:47:52] then he had to do three three and a half
[1:47:54] years so he would have been 34 but if he
[1:47:58] was if he was born in
[1:47:59] Virgo and he started ministering at 30
[1:48:02] then three and a half years will get him
[1:48:04] around to he'll be 33 and a half when he
[1:48:06] died in
[1:48:08] April. It doesn't matter. But I'm just
[1:48:11] saying. Brother Bram says that they the
[1:48:14] constellations tell that that was God's
[1:48:16] first Bible. And if you go through it,
[1:48:17] people have done in-depth study, but the
[1:48:19] main ones that actually the other ones
[1:48:22] are a little bit complicated, but the
[1:48:23] main ones are it starts off as a virgin,
[1:48:24] ends up with Leo the lion. That's the
[1:48:26] main ones that go through there. I've
[1:48:28] got about a few more slides to go, then
[1:48:30] we're
[1:48:31] done. Um the number 40, we know it's
[1:48:34] trials and testings. The flood came for
[1:48:36] 40 days and 40
[1:48:38] nights. When the children of Israel went
[1:48:40] to spy out the land, they took 40 days
[1:48:44] to spy this land out. And I worked it
[1:48:45] out. They had to go 800 km. So 400
[1:48:48] there, 400 back. Okay. To spy out this
[1:48:50] whole land. So they walked about 20 km a
[1:48:53] day. Walking speeds about 5 km an hour.
[1:48:57] So if they did if they walked for 10
[1:48:58] hours a day, they walked for they only
[1:49:00] did 2 km an hour. These guys are doing a
[1:49:03] good check out of the land. They're not
[1:49:06] walking fast. Like 5ks is a average
[1:49:08] walk. So they're walking half that
[1:49:10] speed. So they're they're having a good
[1:49:11] look around. They're good. They do well.
[1:49:14] They didn't just like rush, you know?
[1:49:15] Dave will just be rush to the end, rush
[1:49:17] back. Yeah, she's good. Let's go. They
[1:49:20] walked slow. They walked slow and it
[1:49:22] took them about 20 days to get to one
[1:49:24] end and 20 days to get back. Now, when
[1:49:26] they didn't believe, the Lord said,
[1:49:27] "Okay, for every day you were in the
[1:49:29] land, you're going to be in the
[1:49:30] wilderness for that amount of time." And
[1:49:32] they were in the land for 40 days.
[1:49:34] That's why he said, "Now you're going to
[1:49:36] be in the wilderness now for 40 years.
[1:49:37] One day for each year." I don't think
[1:49:39] it's a coincidence that they took 20
[1:49:40] days there, 20 days back. Cuz 40 always
[1:49:43] has to
[1:49:44] be trial, temptation. Had to be 40
[1:49:47] years. So they maybe some guys wanted to
[1:49:49] walk fast. They said, "No, slow down,
[1:49:50] bro. You're going too fast, you know,
[1:49:52] cuz they had to get back on the 40th
[1:49:53] day. Had to be gone 40 days." God's
[1:49:56] maths always work. Jesus fasted 40 days
[1:49:59] and 40 nights. Moses' life essentially
[1:50:02] was 40 40. He had a very hard life. 40
[1:50:05] 40 years he was in Egypt under Pharaoh.
[1:50:07] 40 years he was in the wilderness. Uh 40
[1:50:08] years well the backside of the desert.
[1:50:10] Then 40 years in the
[1:50:13] wilderness. That was him. 50 is this is
[1:50:16] the last one I've got here. 50 is
[1:50:18] Jubilee which we know why it's Jubilee
[1:50:21] because it's essentially the eighth day.
[1:50:24] It's the start of the eth day. It's the
[1:50:25] start of a new beginning. It's freedom.
[1:50:26] It's you go forth. It's the it's
[1:50:28] eternity. Like you 49 years you're a
[1:50:31] slave. on the 50th year, you're free.
[1:50:33] You've done the you're back to the start
[1:50:35] again. You can go free. Um
[1:50:38] and and the day of Pentecost was 50 days
[1:50:41] after Passover. So Passover was here.
[1:50:43] And then 50 day, the reason why pass the
[1:50:46] reason why the day of Pentecost is is
[1:50:47] because they said it was 50 days later
[1:50:49] that Moses came down with the law from
[1:50:52] he received the law 50 days after
[1:50:53] Passover. So that's why they celebrate
[1:50:55] the day of Pentecost, 50 days
[1:50:57] afterwards. So Jesus was crucified on
[1:51:00] the Passover and then 50 days after that
[1:51:03] which was on the we say oh we're
[1:51:05] Pentecostals. It's actually a it's like
[1:51:07] an Israeli a Jewish feast, you know, p
[1:51:10] the feast of Pentecost, but it just
[1:51:12] happened happened to be the 50th day
[1:51:15] that they were in the upper room and the
[1:51:17] spirit of God came on the 50th day,
[1:51:19] which is the year of Jubilee, the the
[1:51:21] day
[1:51:22] where the eighth day you can go. It's
[1:51:24] it's it's a day of celebration that
[1:51:26] you're free, you know, which was Moses
[1:51:28] received the law then and then the law
[1:51:29] himself came to us on the 50th day,
[1:51:32] which was the eighth day. The last one
[1:51:35] is number 13 which is the number of a
[1:51:37] this is commonly known as the number of
[1:51:39] a woman for some we're not known not for
[1:51:41] some reason I think this is this is why
[1:51:43] they think it is is because the moon in
[1:51:46] one year has a moon has a 28 day lunar
[1:51:49] cycle and then in one year you get um 13
[1:51:53] of these and it equals 364 days and a
[1:51:57] woman is always uh the moon's always
[1:52:00] typed as a woman like and if you think
[1:52:01] the sun and the moon you'd man, woman.
[1:52:04] And brother Bram says, you know, we're
[1:52:06] like the sun. We're like the moon
[1:52:07] reflecting the light of the sun. So the
[1:52:09] moon's always and then the woman has a
[1:52:11] cycle every 28 days. And so there's 13
[1:52:13] throughout the year. So that's why they
[1:52:16] say I think the woman's number is
[1:52:18] 13. You understand that? Yeah. Um and
[1:52:22] that's why brother Brandham said America
[1:52:23] started off with America is a woman's
[1:52:25] nation. It's represented as a woman. It
[1:52:27] started off with these 13 colonies on
[1:52:29] the side here. They were the that was
[1:52:31] what it was for a lot hundreds of years.
[1:52:32] It was just 13 colonies. And then here
[1:52:34] was its flag. It had uh seven red
[1:52:37] stripes and six
[1:52:41] uh yeah, six white ones like that. That
[1:52:43] was and then 13 stars. So you see you
[1:52:45] hear him say he had 13 stripes, 13
[1:52:48] stars, 13. That was it there. And then
[1:52:50] it appears in the 13th chapter of
[1:52:52] Revelation where it says, "I saw a beast
[1:52:54] that was that came up out of the uh the
[1:52:56] sea which amongst many people which was
[1:52:58] the European Catholic Church there."
[1:53:00] Then it says, "I saw a beast come up out
[1:53:02] of the lamb, which was this one here, 13
[1:53:04] coming up out of the land." And
[1:53:08] um it spoke like a lamb, but it had all
[1:53:11] the power of the dragon. And and that
[1:53:15] was this that's what that's it there.
[1:53:18] the that country coming out of the land.
[1:53:20] It's
[1:53:22] 13. Just last one. Just because God just
[1:53:26] can't let this go like he can't just it
[1:53:29] be confusing. Even brother Brandham's
[1:53:32] name is 777.
[1:53:35] Like it could have been 63 and seven or
[1:53:38] something, but it was
[1:53:39] 777. William Mariam Branham. And and he
[1:53:42] said it's grace that changed Abraham.
[1:53:44] No, you didn't know. I just thought this
[1:53:45] up. Grace had to change Abraham from
[1:53:46] Abram which was five to Abraham which
[1:53:48] was seven. He went from five to seven.
[1:53:50] He changed his name and he made it a ham
[1:53:52] with an H. And then it ended up with
[1:53:54] seven. And then brother Brandon pointed
[1:53:55] out that look at the time when he was
[1:53:57] ministering there were the two prophets
[1:53:59] to Sodom which were and he said it's
[1:54:01] Billy Graham which the last name of Ham.
[1:54:03] But there's only six letters in the last
[1:54:04] name. 1 2 3 4 5 six cuz that's going to
[1:54:07] man. This one is for God.
[1:54:10] I want to finish on this one here just I
[1:54:13] just want to with this is the last slide
[1:54:15] here
[1:54:17] but don't forget you're number six which
[1:54:20] what are you
[1:54:22] perfect
[1:54:24] number you're a when God made you and
[1:54:27] made you perfect he made me perfect this
[1:54:29] affected me when I when I understood
[1:54:32] this I thought the Lord made me
[1:54:34] perfect I I was the I was the the apex
[1:54:37] of his creation I don't mind being I I
[1:54:40] quite like number six now. It's that's
[1:54:42] it's that's my perfection. God made me
[1:54:44] perfect. I'll never attain to seven
[1:54:45] because that my God's ways are far above
[1:54:47] my ways, but I'm happy with six. It's
[1:54:50] simple, but it's perfect. Amen. Let's um
[1:54:53] let's stand this morning. Sorry if I if
[1:54:56] I gave you too much information, but
[1:54:57] you'll think about it and you'll go down
[1:54:59] a few rabbit holes. You'll Google some
[1:55:01] things and you'll think, "Is that true?"
[1:55:03] And you'll find out that it
[1:55:07] was. Can we say to musicians that we
[1:55:10] just sing a song?
[1:55:17] Um Oh, can I I'll sing one or
[1:55:27] two. I think what I learned from all
[1:55:30] this when I went into it is
[1:55:33] that, you know, there's nothing in this.
[1:55:36] We're not here by chance. It's not just
[1:55:38] a throw together. Oh, it'll she'll be
[1:55:41] right. Let's see if this all works. We
[1:55:42] we live in a finely tuned
[1:55:46] uh creation that that that everything is
[1:55:48] God's just God's handiwork is all
[1:55:50] throughout this whole creation. And
[1:55:51] we're not here just by a mistake or
[1:55:53] there's it's everywhere you look, you
[1:55:55] just start to see the fingerprints of
[1:55:56] God and right all through his creation.
[1:56:00] And and he made it all for you and me.
[1:56:03] and he came down and died just for you
[1:56:05] and me so that we could enter into life
[1:56:07] back with him. So, so in all the
[1:56:09] complexity of it all, it's actually
[1:56:10] quite simple. He just became a man, came
[1:56:12] down and saved us, and we go back with
[1:56:13] him. That's that's that's how simple it
[1:56:16] is. I want to sing that one. Um um Oh,
[1:56:19] love of God, how rich, how pure, and
[1:56:21] then I'll just hand it over to Josh
[1:56:22] after
[1:56:25] this. I'll start with the chorus. Oh
[1:56:28] love of
[1:56:30] God, how rich and
[1:56:33] pure, how
[1:56:37] measureless and strong.
[1:56:41] It shall
[1:56:44] forever
[1:56:47] pour the saints and
[1:56:52] a
[1:56:54] soul. The love of
[1:56:58] God is
[1:57:01] greater than tongue of
[1:57:05] him can ever tell.
[1:57:10] It goes
[1:57:12] beyond the highest
[1:57:15] star and reaches
[1:57:19] to the lowest
[1:57:22] hill. The guilty
[1:57:26] pit bow down with
[1:57:30] care. God gave his
[1:57:34] son to him.
[1:57:38] his
[1:57:40] child. He
[1:57:44] reconciled and parted
[1:57:48] from
[1:57:51] his love of God.
[1:57:56] How rich and
[1:57:58] good, how
[1:58:03] measulous and
[1:58:06] strong. It shall
[1:58:10] forever endure.
[1:58:14] The saint
[1:58:17] said, "Your
[1:58:20] song when he is of
[1:58:24] time shall pass
[1:58:28] away and earth as the
[1:58:31] throne and kingoms fall.
[1:58:34] [Music]
[1:58:36] And many
[1:58:38] years refuse to
[1:58:42] pray on rocks and

[2:02:27] morning. Lord, we thank you Lord that we
[2:02:29] can see your
[2:02:31] handiwork Lord in everything around us
[2:02:33] Lord and we can see that Lord we are
[2:02:36] fearfully and wonderfully made. We see
[2:02:38] the enemy, Lord, always tries to
[2:02:40] downplay humanity, to downplay us, to
[2:02:43] discourage us, Lord, to to to beat us
[2:02:47] down. Yet, Lord, you made us
[2:02:49] perfect. Lord, you were you had us in
[2:02:53] your mind even way way before anything
[2:02:54] began. When there was zero, when there
[2:02:56] was nothing, when there was nothing here
[2:02:57] at all, we were in your mind. That's how
[2:03:00] far back we go. And that's how infinite
[2:03:02] you are, Lord. And then when each one of
[2:03:05] us came to be, Lord, you were so happy
[2:03:10] to to see your sons and your
[2:03:12] daughters, Lord. And you loved us so
[2:03:14] much that you came down and you redeemed
[2:03:15] us, Lord. And and we see this whole
[2:03:18] complex pattern of everything that
[2:03:20] you've made, everything that you've
[2:03:21] done, Lord. And yet it's so simple that
[2:03:23] you've just you just want to come and
[2:03:25] have fellowship with us. You you came to
[2:03:27] redeem us and just
[2:03:29] in in our quiet time, just come and meet
[2:03:31] with us, Lord. You just want to have
[2:03:32] fellowship, Lord. That's the simplicity
[2:03:34] of the whole gospel is that God that God
[2:03:37] and man will become
[2:03:39] one, Lord. So, we just want to um thank
[2:03:42] you for all that you've done for us,
[2:03:43] Lord. May you bless each one as they go
[2:03:44] their way this morning. Bless bless our
[2:03:46] week, Lord. May we have a prosperous
[2:03:48] week. May we be victorious in every
[2:03:50] faith battle that we come up against.
[2:03:51] May we walk in faith, Lord, and not walk
[2:03:54] in doubt at all. And just just be be
[2:03:56] happy, Lord, and just be full of
[2:03:59] vibrancy and full of life and full of
[2:04:00] your spirit. So I just want to commit
[2:04:02] each one to your hands in Jesus
[2:04:03] wonderful name. Amen. God bless you.
