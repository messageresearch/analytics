[25:00] amen hallelujah so um prise the Lord
[25:04] amen it working oh boy amen
[25:09] so we're going to read
[25:13] a episode in the Bible in Exodus chapter
[25:18] 32
[25:20] amen the Bible says um and when the
[25:23] people saw that Moses is laid to come
[25:25] down out of the mount the people
[25:27] gathered them himself together unto
[25:29] Aaron and said unto him up make us God
[25:34] which shall go before us for as for this
[25:37] Moses the man that brought us out of the
[25:39] land of Egypt we would not what is
[25:42] become of him and Aaron said unto them
[25:45] break off the Golden Earrings which are
[25:47] in the ears of your wives and your son
[25:51] Sons and your daughters and bring them
[25:53] unto me and all the people break the
[25:57] break off the Golden Earrings which were
[25:59] in the ears and brought them unto
[26:02] Aaron and he received them at their head
[26:06] and fishen it with a graving tool after
[26:09] he had made made it a molten cuff and
[26:13] they said this be thy God or Israel
[26:17] which brought thee out of the land of
[26:19] Egypt what a moment you can have you se
[26:22] you see
[26:24] sa
[26:25] so I was um
[26:29] trying to find some U information on the
[26:32] internet and for the Hebrews for the for
[26:35] the Jewish people this and they still
[26:39] remember this moment and they pray for
[26:41] this CU there was a big moment for them
[26:44] idolatry after being saved by God
[26:49] they they shap their own God they wanted
[26:52] to create their own God what a
[26:54] moment but I want to talk to you about
[26:58] this God is not done with you amen after
[27:02] that such a dark moment God he wasn't
[27:05] done with with the people of Israel yes
[27:08] sir amen that's
[27:12] right let me find my notes was it's
[27:15] going to be way too
[27:20] short amen so
[27:23] um I want to show you through the Bible
[27:26] like a a couple of cases when people did
[27:30] horrible things really horrible things
[27:33] but God wasn't done with them even when
[27:36] they thought that they were
[27:37] unworthy God he was still with them
[27:41] Hallelujah and
[27:43] um yeah so we know that Moses went up
[27:46] the mountain to talk to
[27:48] God and God he was going to give him
[27:52] like
[27:53] um all the information that he was going
[27:55] to need the plans of everything how they
[27:59] were had to conduct in this world the
[28:02] clothes that they were had to wear the
[28:04] Ten Commandments everything he was
[28:07] receiving all the information for the
[28:09] people of Israel but because he delayed
[28:13] to come down the people they just start
[28:15] doing whatever they
[28:21] wanted
[28:25] um and if you read like two chapters
[28:30] before you can see that God is telling
[28:32] Moses that they are going to have to
[28:34] build the arc of the Covenant and that
[28:37] they are going to need some
[28:38] gold but the these people they decide to
[28:41] make a golden calf with that gold That
[28:44] was supposed to build chin they decide
[28:47] to make a
[28:49] cow but God wasn't done with them amen
[28:53] amen thank you Lord and um
[28:58] I want to talk to you also about um
[29:02] Aaron because Aaron is the is one of the
[29:05] hero here but no one really talk about
[29:07] her cuz Moses is it's like his big shade
[29:10] Moses is just way too
[29:13] big but Aaron he he was quite
[29:17] important in exod the seven we can read
[29:21] it says and the Lord said unto Moses see
[29:25] I have made thee a God to pharaoh and
[29:28] Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet
[29:30] Thou shalt speak all that I commanded
[29:32] thee and Aaron thy brother shall speak
[29:35] unto Pharaoh that he sent the children
[29:38] of Israel out of his land and chapter 10
[29:41] I mean verse 10 says and Moses and
[29:45] Aaron went into unto pharaoh and they
[29:49] did so as the Lord had commanded and
[29:52] Aaron cast down his Rod before pharaoh
[29:55] and before his servant and it became a a
[29:57] serpent yeah so God he was really using
[30:00] a even if you ask someone I was going to
[30:03] do like a the trick question here but no
[30:05] because it's Wednesday stepan told me
[30:07] not today and that was going to be one
[30:09] of the questions because if you ask
[30:11] which whose Ro became into a serpent
[30:14] everyone's going to say Moses but
[30:16] actually it was
[30:19] Aaron and we can see here that God was
[30:23] dealing with this brothers and I don't
[30:26] know why it remind me uh
[30:28] um jono and
[30:31] um and Malachi Jonah and Malachi because
[30:34] they all the sister was Rebecca I mean
[30:37] uh Miriam so it's like the same thing I
[30:41] don't know why quite
[30:43] nice and here we can find more um
[30:47] information about Aon cuz all the people
[30:50] just think that um Moses was doing all
[30:52] the Miracles but God was actually using
[30:55] Aaron and he says Exodus 7 chap um verse
[30:59] 19 and the Lord spoke unto Moses say
[31:01] unto Aaron take thy rod and stretch out
[31:06] thine hand upon the waters of Egypt upon
[31:09] the streams upon the rivers and upon the
[31:11] ponds and upon all the pools of
[31:14] water that they may become blood blood
[31:18] sorry and that there may be blood
[31:20] throughout all the land of Egypt both in
[31:23] vessels of wood and in vessel of
[31:26] stones another verse says six and Aaron
[31:29] stretched out his hand hand over the
[31:32] Waters of
[31:33] Egypt and the frogs came up and covered
[31:37] the land of Egypt just Aaron again yeah
[31:41] chap uh verse 17 and they did so for
[31:44] Aaron stretched out of his hand hand
[31:47] with his rod and smart the dust out of
[31:50] the earth and it became how do you
[31:53] pronounce this word LI or Li lies in man
[31:56] and it be
[31:58] all the dust of the land became lies
[32:01] throughout all the land of Egypt so we
[32:04] can see them God he was really using
[32:08] Aaron let's go back to this moment so
[32:11] Moses he had to go up and talk to God
[32:14] and Aaron was in charge yeah now we know
[32:18] that God was really using Aaron
[32:21] and Aaron he was a really nice man but
[32:24] he was caught up in this
[32:27] and um they decided to make this a
[32:30] golden cuff and a golden cuff can be
[32:33] anything in your life that it's taking
[32:35] the place of God in your heart can be
[32:37] anything your your talent can be your
[32:40] work can be whatever whatever that you
[32:43] are deciding to put first yeah the the
[32:46] first things always should be God
[32:51] Amen but I don't want to talk much about
[32:54] the golden CS I want to talk about the
[32:56] God wasn't done with any of them I mean
[32:59] with Aaron yeah Aaron I want to talk
[33:01] about Aaron today amen
[33:05] amen and here we can find Exodus 32
[33:09] verse 21 it's when Moses went down the
[33:14] mountain and he saw all this big party
[33:19] but the funny thing is like they knew
[33:22] that they were doing wrong because they
[33:23] stopped as soon as I saw the I saw Mo
[33:25] they saw Moses they were like oh okay
[33:29] the part is over we were doing
[33:32] wrong and I'm pretty sure like if you're
[33:36] doing something wrong in any little
[33:38] small thing that you're doing something
[33:40] wrong there's always a small voice there
[33:42] for you it's telling you you what are
[33:45] you doing but it's right you you have to
[33:49] really fit that little voice and it's
[33:51] going to grow and grow it's not going to
[33:52] be a small voice anymore hallelujah it's
[33:54] going to be really present for you
[33:56] praise the Lord amen so here in Exodus
[33:59] 32 verse 24 says and Moses said unto
[34:03] Aaron what did these people unto thee
[34:07] thou that thou Hast brought so great a
[34:10] sin upon them and Aaron said let not be
[34:14] anger of my Lord WX heart thou knowest
[34:17] the people that they are set on Mischief
[34:21] for they said unto me make us a god
[34:23] which shall be before us for as for this
[34:27] Moses the man that brought us out of the
[34:29] land of Egypt we would not what has
[34:31] become of him and I said unto them
[34:34] whatsoever have any gold let them break
[34:37] it off so they gave it to me then I cast
[34:40] it into the fire and there came out of
[34:42] this
[34:43] calf I think that the last verse is
[34:46] quite funny because he's saying I just
[34:48] throw this all this go into the fire and
[34:50] this is what came out but you can see
[34:52] that he used a carving tool and he did
[34:56] it but of course he was scared that a
[34:59] couple of days
[35:01] ago that mountain was shaking and there
[35:04] was thunders in with everything was very
[35:06] scary for them so he was just I would
[35:10] say that he was very scared do you
[35:12] remember when
[35:13] they like um when they were around
[35:16] Jericho and this man decided to take a
[35:19] little treasure for him and all his
[35:21] family would
[35:23] kill that's that's the same God
[35:27] but God wasn't done with Aon amen Aon
[35:31] Aaron he was predestinated to be a
[35:33] priest a high priest the first high
[35:37] priest he was oh man he was
[35:40] predestinated to be
[35:42] that Exodus
[35:44] 30 the the golden cuff is in chapter 32
[35:48] but in Exodus 30 this is God talking and
[35:51] said to Moses and thou shalt anoint
[35:53] Aaron for his and his sons and cons
[35:57] consecrate them and they may Minister
[36:00] unto me in the priest
[36:02] office God he knew what everyone was
[36:05] going to do yeah but he choose him
[36:08] anyways it doesn't matter what are you
[36:10] going to do in your life cuz no human
[36:13] mistake can take the calling of the Lord
[36:15] in your life doesn't matter where you
[36:18] and it can be like a past mistake
[36:21] something in your life that is stopping
[36:22] you or it can be something that you can
[36:24] do in the future I'm not telling you to
[36:27] go and do something
[36:29] silly but he chose you that's right and
[36:32] he's not done with you amen amen so now
[36:35] we can see Aaron as a high priest
[36:39] wearing his spectrol and everything he
[36:43] looks he looks nice yeah and I'm pretty
[36:46] sure that when he was being a priest
[36:49] every time that he was going to offer a
[36:51] sacrifice to the
[36:53] Lord he he was not going to be a really
[36:56] proud man
[36:57] he were going to be so
[36:59] humble because he he did something very
[37:02] wrong but the Lord forgive him and I
[37:04] think that's the way that we should be
[37:06] like all the time
[37:08] yeah to be proud of ourselves it's it's
[37:13] a we it's a really horrible things yeah
[37:16] amen but that's what I like about the
[37:18] story of Aaron that the Lord
[37:22] really loved him and so he's a
[37:28] he couldn't see over his mistake and he
[37:30] decid to use him
[37:32] anyways
[37:36] amen so we also have David that he he
[37:40] also did something wrong something very
[37:44] wrong he slept with another man wife and
[37:49] he killed a
[37:51] man but God wasn't done with
[37:54] him he he he forgive
[37:58] him because in his heart he was so
[38:02] sorry and that's the way that we should
[38:04] be always like if we made a mistake
[38:08] don't we don't have to think that the
[38:10] Lord is done with us hallelujah he chose
[38:13] us and he's always going to be with us
[38:16] amen than you father another character
[38:19] in The Bible here is
[38:20] Simpson he was a very strong man
[38:22] physically he was so
[38:25] strong but he weakness uh and I wanted
[38:28] to say this uh the last time that I that
[38:30] I was here
[38:32] but the weakness of Samson was the
[38:36] ladies you know it was like no Christian
[38:40] ladies and he was a very strong man and
[38:43] there was was the same weakness of
[38:46] Solomon and for this young boys it's
[38:50] like I don't want to be mean but you're
[38:52] not strong as Samson and you're not as
[38:54] smart as Solomon so be careful with
[38:59] non-Christian ladies they can really
[39:03] give you hard
[39:05] time but the Lord had something for him
[39:08] when he thought that he was
[39:10] done the Lord was going to use him one
[39:13] more
[39:13] time the Lord he wasn't done with him
[39:16] Amen in that um jail where he
[39:21] was also Peter he was the Lord I will
[39:26] say the best friend he was a really
[39:28] friend of the Lord he really loved
[39:31] him but when he was scared he denied him
[39:35] three times he was just so scared and he
[39:38] run away and he wanted to do what he he
[39:41] wanted to go back to his old life he
[39:44] want to be a fisherman
[39:45] again but the Lord h a a high call for
[39:49] Peter
[39:50] too
[39:52] and those three um when he denied the
[39:55] Lord three times it BEC his three
[39:58] confirmations when the Lord asked him
[40:00] Peter do you love me and he said yes
[40:03] Lord I love
[40:04] you Peter do you love me yes Lord and
[40:08] the third time I think it's so powerful
[40:11] because Peter he says to the Lord Lord
[40:15] you know all the things yeah you you
[40:18] know what's in my heart yeah I love you
[40:22] and that's what I really love about
[40:23] Peter so when Jesus resurrect here in
[40:26] Mark
[40:27] 16 the angel said to
[40:30] them and he said unto them Be not Afraid
[40:34] ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was
[40:37] crucified he is risen he is not here
[40:40] behold the place where they led him but
[40:44] go your way tell his disciples and Peter
[40:48] that he go before you into Galilee there
[40:51] shall ye see him as he said unto you
[40:57] I think that verse is so powerful
[40:58] because he saying tell all of them but
[41:01] don't forget Peter the Lord he really
[41:04] wanted to see Peter and that's so
[41:06] powerful cuz Peter he was feeling
[41:09] terrible because he denied the Lord but
[41:12] he wasn't done with with him amen thank
[41:15] you Lord as as he is not done with you
[41:19] either doesn't matter what you have
[41:22] done you have something to do here he's
[41:25] not done with you
[41:27] amen
[41:29] amen in Roman I'm going to give you some
[41:32] the last verses sorry I was only able to
[41:35] do 30 minutes so
[41:39] far we were aiming for 20 but no Romans
[41:43] 8 uh verse 30 says moreover whom he did
[41:48] predestinate them also he called and
[41:51] whom he called them he also Justified
[41:54] and whom he justified them also
[41:56] glorified I really love that verse cuz
[41:59] it's in past
[42:01] sentence for him it's done for him you
[42:04] are already up in heaven you made it for
[42:08] him you made it that's why he sees you
[42:10] perfect yeah thank you Lord amen Philip
[42:13] Philippians um 1 verse 6 says being
[42:17] confident of this very thing that he
[42:19] which had began a good work in you will
[42:22] perform it until the day of Jesus
[42:25] Christ Hallelujah he will finish the
[42:28] work in you he's still working in you
[42:31] amen and I have a last quote here says
[42:37] he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring
[42:39] you if you wasn't worthy he knows your
[42:42] heart that's right he knows what you are
[42:45] he knows your motives he knows what you
[42:48] are there are traps all along the road
[42:51] sure the devil will cause you to stumble
[42:54] and you say I didn't mean to to do that
[42:57] God you know it you are still perfect
[43:00] because there is a perfect blood offered
[43:02] to you offer for you amen every day in a
[43:07] beding sacrifice hanging Before the
[43:09] Throne of the almighty God that's right
[43:12] amen thank you Lord amen he cannot make
[43:17] any mistake and if he called you he's
[43:19] going to finish the work in you if you
[43:21] think that the Lord is not with you no
[43:25] he's with you amen amen and God is not
[43:27] done with you amen well I was only able
[43:31] to speak for 15 minutes but let's have
[43:34] the musicians amen this is a prayer
[43:36] meeting I was told it was only 20
[43:40] minutes amen amen hallelujah and
[43:43] actually I can I can share with you a
[43:44] little testimony just do going for the
[43:47] the time again so I remember when when I
[43:50] was like 18 or 19 I wanted to be a
[43:54] detective in in Chile that uh that
[43:57] career is called um investig and I
[44:02] wanted to be one of them man I my entire
[44:05] life I wanted to be a detective and even
[44:08] when I was like 18 there were some
[44:10] people saying Oh you talked like that
[44:13] detective you look like a detective and
[44:16] I was like yeah I'm going to be a
[44:18] detective so I applied to became a
[44:20] detective and I there was three test I
[44:22] passed number one number
[44:25] two and they didn't call me I I mean I
[44:29] did the number three like test but they
[44:31] didn't call me back and man I was
[44:34] destroying cuz I really wanted to be a
[44:38] detective so I I I aim for my second
[44:42] dream that I was become like a
[44:44] professional guitarist and I went to
[44:46] study
[44:48] music and I was caught up on drugs on
[44:50] every on all that the world can offer to
[44:53] you and I couldn't make like two two of
[44:56] my dreams like it was just something
[44:59] that that I couldn't make and for for
[45:03] like a couple of years I was really
[45:06] really like on drugs and drinking like
[45:08] heavily like every single day I was just
[45:11] trying to block myself out of out of
[45:14] that thing that I was not able to do to
[45:17] you know to become real any of my
[45:20] dreams right but the Lord he wasn't done
[45:23] with me he he wanted me to come here
[45:26] cuz if I could have become like a
[45:29] detective I would I wouldn't be here
[45:31] today that's right and probably I
[45:33] wouldn't even be serving the lord cuz
[45:35] when you have money and when you have
[45:37] all what you want you don't need the
[45:39] Lord there's so many people out of there
[45:41] that they don't need the Lord they feel
[45:44] that they don't need the Lord but when
[45:46] you are
[45:47] hanging oh yes on a little string man

[45:53] need him amen that was my testim can we
