nothing but you would come out of the pages of this book father not man's ideas not our own way of thinking father but you unadulterated you jesus christ revealed today in our life lord it's worth

a place where you can work and deal with every christian here tonight father may they not leave without that blessing i pray this in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ hallelujah amen amen let's give him a hand of applause amen amen do you not think how much we're going to shout when we get to heaven when when this whole pest house is over the plan of redemption is unfolded everything has been wrapped up and we're back in heaven what can happen then i don't think there's enough vocals in this body to contain that we're going to need a body change right musicians god bless you thank you so much let's give them a hand applause hallelujah amen amen i am so nervous praise the lord it's a good place to be hallelujah um i i want to kind of have a disclaimer here tonight if i may um if you ever come to church and you don't come ready for what god's going to give you be careful because when god comes your way and he wants to deal with something he's going to deal with it anyways he's sovereign he's god but if you came to church and you've got a need a real need for deliverance that you really mean business with god you will get what you want but see it starts with the attitude before we even open this word it starts with that attitude and i encourage you whatever i say take it in the attitude between you and god it's not a very heavy service it is actually i don't know which way is going to go but i know there is a burden on my heart to tell you children you as well listen you can only get blessed if you're looking for a blessing amen you can only find riches if you are seeking for riches you can only get something if you really wanted you cannot tell me when germany and brazil was playing in the world cup final the one that won it was the one was oh it's the bounce of the ball it's a round ball it bounces every way the same up down roll this way that way but see the team that wanted it the most on the day is the one that won the game so i know it's not a soccer game this but it's a very simple concept you want to be blessed you want to grow in the lord you need to find that blessing you need to pull don't fall asleep don't get all distracted this is your chance to get your blessing so go and get it amen liam stein god bless you welcome back at church i missed you man it's my own son but he was so sick man same i've never seen him so sick and it's good to have you back my son good to have you back here amen so let's open our bibles i don't i don't preach like any other preachers because i'm not any other preacher i'm your brother so if you think i'm preaching at you you got it wrong we're brothers and sisters we are growing in god so please don't take it as a preaching if you can put that slideshow up i really want to ask you one question tonight has the light struck the lens so all i'm going to ask you you think of these words every slide we go into i remind you has the light struck the links and if you can honestly answer that question tonight you will know where you stand with god because there comes a time in a believer's life where you have to have have to have experience with god and if you haven't had that experience seek it amen with everything in you because you will never really see the true light of the gospel if you haven't had the experience with god and i will prove it by the scriptures tonight lord willing if he allows me to so our very first slide we're going to go to is we're going to go to the book of john john 8 1-12 so it might be a little bit mixed up do forgive me if it is but i know the lord will tie it all together so we we get here on a scene and we did open in a word of prayer i did yeah we did um jesus went here to the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and he taught them and the scribes and the pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery when they had said her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act guilty beyond reason with witnesses in the very act now moses in the law command us that and that that such should be um stoned but what say is thou now look here this they said tempting him that they might have accused to i have to accuse him so the whole motive about this whole scene they don't care about the sister on the ground they don't care about the act that she committed they don't even care about the law of moses all they want is to see how they can trick him into saying something that is contrary to them so they can crucify him or stone him that's all their motive is about the only reason they come to church is to find fault with the message the only reason they they walk around you is to find an excuse to get a way off these guys did not want god in their life they did not seek god with all their heart all they really wanted was the excuse it's all they wanted the very god himself in flesh standing by them and all these people want is an excuse sad place to be very dangerous place to be but a sad place to be yet they find them there now we continue with that he says um but jesus stooped down came out of heaven came down to us just see the type here and with the finger he wrote on the ground as he didn't hear them as though he never hurt them amen lest you stop there you can all have your seats may the lord bless his word tonight now i do get excited when i when i share these things because i feel there is an emotion connected to everything that god shows me so i've i've experienced more here in this little sermon in my life in a long time because god actually spoke to me about it so if this is not for you this was for me okay it's a good it's a timely reminder for me so if we go to that next slide it says now here so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her because he knew the intention of the heart so he says if you want to excuse there's enough excuses but i want to ask you something are you without fault are you without blemish do you not need a redeemer do you not need christ are you so high and mighty and you forgot where you came from because all of us has a testimony all of us had a time with god had to get us off our knees when we were groveling so far in sin we couldn't even see the light of day so don't forget that brother sisters don't forget where you come from because we cannot introduce christ to no one if we forgot where our testimony got us from sister vanessa i look at you now but i've never ever when she told me a testimony i would never ever say that was sister vanessa but if you never shared the testimony i couldn't know where she came from i couldn't know the type of person she was so i can't see how god worked in her life because if i look at the sister vanessa of now and i look at the sister vanessa i heard in the testimony they are worlds apart and yet they're still growing in christ so so no matter how small your your your testimony is god has still done something in your life do not not testify i'm getting ahead of myself okay [Laughter] amen now jesus here comes the beautiful part and i'll tell you what scripture i think according to brother man so it's not according to the prophet or the message or the it's something i read between the lines so if it's not for you just throw it away this is my blessing he says and they which heard it being convicted in their heart in their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest this is eldest the most established mature christians in the church even unto the least and jesus was left alone but see when he stooped down again and he wrote on the ground i believe he wrote the scripture sister can you put that up for us two uh chronicles 6 and verse 36 brother ben said that last weekend or sunday and when i when i saw the scripture it opened up something for me so praise the lord amen it says oh i'll just read it don't worry i'll just read it it says if they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth not and thou be angry with them now look look the the the pharisees knew what they were doing they said so this is just like the devil is they didn't know if he was god but they knew he was god but they didn't know it was god but they knew he was god because he was doing miracles god was with him things were happening so so they didn't know if they were actually challenging god or were challenging man so they were uncertain the devil i don't know if they'll be the son of god if they'll not be if thou if they'll not be the whole time in two minds they're not steadfast going in a direction they're always if not if not they're trying to to like you know like fencing is it you is it not is it you is it not and that's what they're busy doing here so they know they basically either tempting god going against the scripture of the messiah that has to come or actually this man is wrong but because they weren't sure and they didn't seek the scriptures now they they've got a little bit of fear and this scripture says they that sin against thee for there is no man that does that which sinneth not and thou be angry with him so they know if they get this wrong the motive behind this lady's life if they get that wrong god's going to sort them out and the consequence of that is and deliver them over before their enemies and they will carry them away captives onto a land far or near so they know that if we get this wrong there's going to be a penalty because by moses law and your commandments and everything you taught us in the old testament not new testament if we get this wrong god's going to be against us and that's why jesus would have written he that has no sin let him cast the first stone because i think while he was writing this because he stood up and they were still busy and then he went back down and he wrote the rest of it i think the first part for me is he was writing hey you you have sin as well but remember if you go past this line you get judgment because he's still god sovereign mighty god you ask the old testament saints if he is if he's a hard god huh have you ever thought about it korra dayton asked him oh samson what type of god do we serve a fluffy fluffy god that's just got love no seriously because sometimes with the new testament we're so much into grace and so much into mercy that we forget there is also a law there is also a word of god and we have to believe it all i'm so off my notes but praise the lord there is still there is still you reap what you sow so you can't just you can't just walk on we angels fear to to go we we we ran we run we angels fear to go because sometimes we don't understand that we're still serving a mighty god a sovereign god a deity a force that we do not understand sometimes but we'll go on with the sermon because i left my notes but they didn't know that it was the messiah or not so the pharisees were playing with fire and they knew that there was a response to that fire and when a holy fire falls it consumes it consumes anything that's not of god will be burned in that fire amen if we can don't worry i'll go there can you put me back on that slide i'll go there it's fine okay praise the lord and she said no man lord so she's looking around her now and all her accusers are gone they want to take away from the story but there's many of them jesus said to uh neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more instruction you found grace you found mercy but don't do it anyway just don't do it again he didn't preach to her hour he didn't try to explain the gospels to her he wasn't trying to show her where in the bible was what were written in moses law he just said don't go and sin no more simple instruction if you really repent and you're really sorry don't do it again amen because you can't accept you can't accept god's grace and his mercy and then go and do it again and accept god's grace and mercy and do it again and keep with the cycle of sin because you haven't accepted it there it hasn't become a moment where the light struck the land it hasn't become a moment where god said to you i'm dealing with that you need to let it go those moments are the moments where it is fire inside your bones those moments is when your tummy goes like this and you know i need to get either tell the truth here sorry mom dad i broke the window or whatever there's those moments where god is actually saying you cannot lie i don't like it and you have to go and cough it up and you have to confess that there's a moment for each one like that and you know when that moment is but you've got two choices as always you can either heed to the word of god or you can keep quiet but you make your choices and you know what if you keep quiet you'll just go around the mountain another time if you get quiet you'll go around the mountain another time because when god is speaking to you and trying to get your attention he's trying to tell you something he's trying to to to correct something get it out of you so brother paul said very beautifully he said why would this sovereign god thank you brother come from heaven get mutilated basically if you think how they stripe this back if you think the suffering if you think the lies they falsely excused him they they were trying out to kill him he had no place to sleep he didn't even have his own clothes man like he grew up and he just had to be happy with everything he got he had no wife he didn't have a right to a wife he didn't have a right to have friends and go out and do what you guys do today he was subjected to the word of god fully for you what type of people ought we to be what type of people are we to be when god takes the time steps from his throne of glory sovereign mighty god comes down to this earth goes through all of that just to go sorry think about the we should be shaken sometimes and think that we we think that this gospel it's not a game it's not a game it's a for real life brother david you're good don't worry it's a for real life moment on this earth where you have a chance to represent the kingdom of god it's a real-time year where you need to be sober you only have this space in eternity that you have here to to glorify our god i'm not off my notes this one is right on my nose so i want to ask has the light really struck the lens has the light really struck the leaves this sister found herself dragged at the feet of christ standing there in the midst instead of dragging people before god why don't we pray for them see because the attitude towards your brother or your sister you know that is so wrong and just not walking with god and you know they're never going to get it right though and it's not mixed up they won't make it and i can see nothing happens in that house and this one is not praying nothing this one's making too much noise and that where are you looking where's your focus where is your focus if you look at all these other things where actually is your focus are you so worried about your brother you're missing what the you're looking at the scene wrong you're looking at the scene and not the unseen it's easy to state the obvious it's easy to say hey he got it wrong it's hard to say hey you got it wrong but you know what god's busy doing a mighty work in his life and you know what it's even harder to say god's doing a mighty work in his life i will pray for that brother it's hard because human possibly we always want to be right we always want to be right so a true believer will not drag someone like the pharisees before god a true believer will pray for someone will sincerely go on his knees and say lord i don't stand up here until i understand brother armand i will not stand up here until i can figure that man out because lord i don't want to feel like this i don't want satan to steal my joy i don't want to come and sit in church and fall asleep i'm about to close would that help come on guys we haven't even started yet man it depends on your attitude here's another example i just can read it the woman saith unto him i know that when messiah cometh which is called christ when he has come he will tell us all these things who can tell me little children who can tell me what story is this about raise your hand let's see if i can pick someone daniel what is the story about no he's gone jonathan woman at the well oh kind of gave it away [Laughter] okay so who can tell me what did jesus tell her what did jesus tell her before she got to this place we see i know if when messiah come with you tell us these things what did jesus tell her liam he asked her that as well yes but he said something else that got her attention momo what was she doing she had five husbands and the sixth one she was with wasn't a husband now think about it what if a guy comes your way tomorrow let's let's let's just go a little bit carnal let's go one level down i like into you kids let's say there's a brother coming tomorrow and he says to you abe can i use this example you didn't do it so but i'm just going to blame you anyways he comes and says abe you took a ball that was lying next to the street at the number 104 of that gate the person saw you but what you chose to do is hide it under your vest and you took it home says but that's not all then you kicked out the window and blamed it on someone else like jesse because jesse always kicks the ball jesse wasn't there to defend himself so he got in trouble you didn't know that but he actually got a big box law then the next day you go to your dad and your dad goes hey guess what i gave jesse yesterday pakslaw for kicking out that window remember you told me about he says and then the lady from one two four came down the road and said hey that ball is actually mine so i thought it was jesus so i gave him another box law but this guy just came to you and said exactly what happened yesterday and he wasn't even there would it get your attention would it he just told you what you've done you know for a fact there's no way somebody knew it because you hit it and you went away he doesn't even know jesus he doesn't even know who's your dad but he comes to you and says you've just done that yesterday now you tell me what is the supernatural about that everything because he's not supposed to know this so now i want to ask you here's a prayer line going oh did i thank you brother he has a prayer line going and the prophet stands before someone i want to ask you this i want you to think soberly now come come and approach god the way he needs to be approached there's a man standing in front of a lady telling a lady you have a blood issue but if i can help you what i'm going to do is going to tell you where you come from and then i'm going to tell you who you are and then i'm going to tell you what the doctor said is going to happen to you and then i'm going to tell you what god's going to do for you today then you listen to that voice respond back to what's been said and you tell me if that's not god you can fake it only for that many times how many sermons that this prophet had how many times did have to god prove him over and over and over again how many times did he go back to the congregation and says if anything is contrary what that word said tonight then i'm a false witness then you come and tell me but if it is god if it is the truth you follow him not me him he always pointed people back into the word he always pointed back people towards christ he never took the glory for it never not one sermon i've listened i had a worked with brother andy and them for a year the lord blessed me to work for them for the year and for a year i was eating every sermon you could think of of brother branham sorry gloves are off i think this is a message shirts we might as well preach the truth i ate every sermon and i've seen the websites out there believe the sign all these things let me tell you that if you base your salvation on a website shame on you if you base your salvation on any preacher that preaches to you shame on you because if you cannot find what is preaching back in this word in this word leave it alone but if it is this you better follow it you better follow it because i'm going to prove by these couple of examples the people that weren't looking back in the word is the one that mr messiah because this lady wasn't a pharisee she wasn't a trained scholar but yet she had the gumption to know that if this man could tell me what i've done in the secret parts of my heart isn't that the very messiah and what did she do he says what seekers thou he says i am he says and marveled and talked with a woman and the disciples come back and they don't talk to him because they knew he talked to the woman then the woman left her water pot and went into the city and saved to the men shame on her she has to run into the city to go tell the men there's a prophet a mighty prophet here that's busy telling the word of god where was that mean but see jesus needed to go there she says come and see which told me all things that i ever did so there's something that happened here this event where the light struck her heart and she knew this is more than a man speaking this is a doctrine he wasn't trying to convince her by the scriptures he wasn't trying to pull some mysteries out of her he wasn't trying to say this is what david did and he just spoke straight onto her into a heart saying sister brother god is trying to get your attention are you actually listening what is your what is your heart towards what he's gonna give you how are you gonna receive it are you just gonna put up a shield and block it or can you take it and go back to your word and go find the truth because if it's not in here don't follow it that's my advice again prophet of god picks it up here and he says because you see jesus said this is in sirs would we see jesus i'm just going to analyze this a bit he says no man can come to me except the father draws him and all that the father has given me will come to me amen and he said that did he not congregation says aiming in the sermon what was it there was there is what the bible said in hebrews and any corrects themselves in the book of revelation in the last day there will be the antichrist it will rise up on the scene so close like the real thing it will deceive the very elected if possible it means in the lady you see a church age when he sends this messenger to come and warn us and to to to gather all the mysteries of god the two spirits the antichrist spirit and god's spirit would be so close that it was deceived a very elected if possible now if you can answer me this question you know where i'm going where would the elect find the truth here but they won't find it here and they won't find it here they would find it here all of it eat the book the whole book because it's sweet in your mouth and bit in your belly why would it be bitter in your belly because sometimes you need to do things that not feeling good that's contrary to what you believe in or was raised in or was taught in something that's so far out that i would one day go and tell my wife all the deepest darkest secrets i've ever done because god said and confirmed that i had to do it my marriage was on the line i'll testify a little bit of it i wasn't i wasn't going to get divorced but it was at such a point that what i was going to say and tell my wife could break and make our marriage but see god sent the first service and there was a preacher and he preached to me and he said you better get clean with this then the next brother danny white came and he preached and he says the devil has one right punch and he's allowed to use it you all know some of some of you know this testimony i thought i'll share it and then i said to him the first of us has said lord you should hear this i said lord just like gabriel i'm going to put this fleece outside let the ground be dry in the fleece and the fleece wet i'll know it's you so he sends me the next preacher he says you better come clean with the sin you better tell her because now he's stealing in my heart he didn't say it over the pope but the preacher didn't go to me and say hey brother armand this is now time you're gonna david you're gonna now confess all your sins he was preaching at all of us but the light struck the lengths it came to my ears and into my heart and now god started dealing and i was not feeling comfortable in that service i was really uncomfortable i said if you would ask me a question then i'm happy and that service i would have had you should have seen my face i'm sure the devil and god both were looking at me going something's going on here god knew the devil was wondering because he was trying to to get all this dress all this this this unbelief all this filthy sin out of me so that he can clean me because you can't put clean water in a dirty vessel and have clean water come out you can't impossible so sorry i get excited and i shout um yeah i'm going to my wife reminding me gideon so we went to the second service and he says about this right punch so of course me i pray i say lord i'm in turmoil because i know what i'm about to share it's heavy so i said lord you know what i love my wife and i know you love my wife because we were at a stage in our walk where we shantell was having a real revival with the lord and she was real close and she was feeding off the word and she was just happy now why would i want to spoil that and satan you know what he says to me he says to me in the first service he says you you can just keep quiet because you don't want to hurt your wife's feelings she doesn't need to know this because remember you put it under the blood but did i did i put it under the blood saying oh lord jesus forgive me have i actually placed it under the blood because the sin is still lying there the accuser still has the card that he can play so he's got all the cards in his hand he can still play them i still have the sin it's not under the blood because it's not confessed it's not brought to the surface it's not god forgive me for what i've done it's still there and the brother preaches on it and i go back to him and say okay lord again gideon took this fleece i said i would tell my wife but i need you to tell me you got my back i promise this is how i talk to god because i think you should be real when you talk to god don't try to go oh holy god oh great and try to just talk to him really talk to him say lord i don't want to lose my wife i love her i love you how's this going to plan out i don't know but i'm going to ask you i'm going to put this fleece out again let the grout be dry and let the fleece be wet now because i need to know that this is you because if it's not you and i do it and it's out of your season there will be consequences all right so service is up i'm in turmoil but i just start really getting over us because i see lunch and i'm feeling really good and i think a real real good christian loves food you know because it's just so good with fellowship and i'll demonstrate this i hope the cameraman can follow me and i go sit on the chair they're in the service and i sit there after service or relaxing because god was dealing with me but i'm gonna eat now i'm now happy because i'm out of church believe it or not that's what i thought and guess who comes strolling my way brother gideon milan now remember what i asked him in the service and brother gideon lord knows it's a testimony brother please confirm it one day with all these lovely saints they can see the wonderful work of god and brother gideon comes and he shakes my hand and he says hey brother how are you doing i said good good i don't i forgot his name is gideon because i forget her name the moment i turn my back pretty much says it's a gift not everybody can do it okay but i can and he's and he says can i tell you my testimony and everything inside me right then went nope nope nope no no no no no no no no but my mouth went yes brother please but i promise you inside me it went no that's what my inside went and i thought oh this guy's a preacher boy he's just gonna preach the whole time and this is what's going on in my head split seconds come on this is thoughts and he just goes can i share my testimony and my lips man brother andy you should know this by now my lips man they give me away and my lips goes yes slow motion and i'm thinking what have i done and he comes and sits next to me and he starts sharing his testimony and it's everything that i'm busy with everything i'm hiding everything that's between me and my wife that's unforgiven sin everything that the devil still has and he pops up and he walks away real nice and friendly and i'm shattered because what the light struck the limbs he's put light on sin so bright that there's no spotlight that could there's no way sin can hide now it is a a hundred billion trillion candle light light flaming fire light onsen saying you better tell her oh yeah so i walk outside and i go okay lord i'm gonna tell her i said but i want just one thing just man we can bargain with god sometimes eh yes how does he have so much patience with us man i would have just slapped me three times already but he said he said i said to him lord i will tell my wife but i will only start talking to her when my children sleep i've got four hours to drive back will be the longest four hours of my life but the moment the kids fall asleep now i'm hoping they last for four hours because man i don't really want to do this i rather want the perfect setting at the perfect place where i can have my wife at the perfect time to perfectly break her heart okay this is what i want this is what human wants or i can just do what god tells me to do and i do it and i said so if the kids fall asleep i'll start talking god the moment they fall asleep i will start talking how quickly did they fall asleep love first round about a stratford man church is here roundabout is there they both blop gone i look in the mirror i look in the mirror i'm like oh dear i'm so far off my nose but praise the lord there's a reason for this so now stuff got real and for the next four hours i break my wife's heart i break the way she looks at me i break the way that i told her i was all confidence everything she had in me i destroy but i want to tell you one thing you know who had the battle he because he said to me do it so that means when he says to you show up to the battle he already has the expected end you don't need to worry how it's going to pan out that's not your job just show up and do what he tells you to do just do it is it is it really that hard if he's got the battle and he's got your victory and he says do it is it that hard not to do it see brother branham says you have to fight your way to hell god gives us enough chances to go over and over again come back to him you have to fight your way to hell i'm so far off my computer switch off here we go amen amen so basically what he says here in the book of revelation a revolution after revolution revelation revolution as well it revoluted my life um i think i'm still in the revolution i'm fighting against the the enemy he says he said fool the very elected of possible he delivered all upon the earth whose names were written not in the lamb's book of life so your book is already written somewhere god already knows how your life's going to go the only one to kick against the god the god plans plan of god is you not the devil the devil just gives you a run around the only one to kick against the word and the plan of god is you you could just get yourself out of the way i'll go over next slide he says here and this is where i want to concentrate on and what was she she was one that had a name there that woman at the well no matter what kind of state she was in didn't care didn't care what was going to happen it's not part of the conversation i don't care what state you in child i've got a plan for you are you willing to surrender to my plan i don't care how far you've gone in sin or how far you've gone out of unbelief i've got a plan for you can you follow my plan that's all god's asking he doesn't ask much he says um a little light struck the little prostitute she recognized it why there was something in to spark it off so there was something in you already to know that when god starts dealing with you it's god you cannot tell me when god is dealing with you you don't know i shouldn't be doing this he's dealing with you and it will only he says and you she recognized it you might pour water in gasoline it will only hinder it but let a little fire hit at one time and watch what happens you see it takes a sparking of faith of the word of god then you'll know um it's true there there was something will happen so this sister she she spoke to jesus woman at the well and and he said to her you know your husband's all those things so what did she do she run she got a sparks you run into samaria and she went and preached the gospel to them not preach it but share the testimony okay okay amen here we go now here's our next one we've got another 50 slides so don't worry we're about we're about to close it gets better now moses oh mr moses so what i want to talk to you about here is moses stephen spoke about this very very event before he got stoned and then he ticked off the pharisees because he says you you god is the tomb of the prophets but you put them all there and when he said that they got angry they just wanted to stone him they dragged him out to sydney and stone him but what he did he said something here and it will go to acts 7 now we'll go there where they stone him verse 23 and it goes to verse 28. i want to quickly tell you here so this is the types so acts 7 verse 23 to 28 so you don't think i lied to you i'll say it one more time so acts 7 verse 23 to 28 so stephen is busy talking them he says and when it was and when he was full 40 years old so look at the state of moses moses is on the back side of the desert he's looking after his father jeffrey's sheep okay and stephen picks the story up and he's busy now telling the pharisees hey this is no more than a man i want to show you how the scriptures but see they didn't look on the scriptures here they still just looked at one thing so he says to them and when it was a full 40 years old it came into his heart to visit the brethren the children of israel and seeing one of them suffering wrong this is now moses he defended him and avenged him and was a priest and he smote the egyptian and he was supposed to he was supposed his brethren would have understood that god by his hand by moses's hand would deliver them but they understood not so moses taking it upon himself not god's provided way not waiting for god to say go but being keen and zealous in everything smites this egyptian buries him and they see so now look at this and he says and the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove and um and he would have set them one against the other saying sirs are you brethren why do we um wrong one to another but he that but he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away saying who made thee ruler and judge over us will thou kill me as you did as the egyptian yesterday so so so they basically looking at him they're looking at the scene again not the unseen but he's trying to do it at his ability and his own brethren rejects him and stephen is busy talking about this to the pharisees and the statuses before they stone him because he's trying to get their attention to say hey he wanted to do it his way but god's provided way he says he'll send them the next 40 years and we're going to go there we can go back to the slide there um so he's sharing this testimony but all that the pharisees do and if you go back to the previous chapter acts 6 here the last verse in verse 13 it says and set up false witnesses which say this man chases not and speak blasphemy as words against the holy peace and the law so the the pharisees just wanted to trick stephen into stoning him so again the motive behind that was just not to receive the word for the day but actually to crucify the word to kill the word so who was doing the work there god be the holy spirit can't be god i'm going somewhere with that if we look at our brothers and sisters and we look at that type of attitude towards them we have failed we are looking not with god's heart and god's eyes but we're looking with carnal eyes and the pharisees could never get over the cornum realm they could not move past the canality because they only looked at everything that was eyesight and not what was inside they didn't look at the at unseen so here we've got moses kept the flock and he was on the black i call it the backslide of the desert because he slid away and the law he did he was backsliding because because he now went and felt sorry for himself and god had to get that temper of him out and so he gave him a wife with a temper and trust me she sorted him out you don't want a wife with a temper i don't have one with a temper i'll get a lovely wife god bless you sister chantal i'll just call it sister chandela get in trouble and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush so now i want to get your attention the light's going to struck something here let's get this right he says and he looked and behold the bush was burning with fire and the bus was not consumed so kids if i take a bush and i light it what's going to happen with it it's not going to stay there gabriella it burnt up but see this one wasn't burning up it was just staying where it was the leaves didn't even burn so now look at moses i hope you can put yourself in the scripture and moses said i will turn aside i will turn aside and see the great sight why this bush is not burned out and the lord when he saw that armand turned aside and saw you can put your name there and god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and he said armand moses moses armand and and armand said here am i look at them approach he didn't try to figure it out we'll go on now moses was 80 years old instead of being a deliverer he looked like all hopes was gone and he was he was a sheepherder for his father-in-law my way back on the backside of the desert one morning walked along and the sun coming up and he looked over and he see the bernie bush god always gives something to attract the attention of a believer amen did he attract your attention has your attention been attracted oh yes or does it still need to happen do i need to get you guys to stand up and sit down again i know i'm going long but come on man hang in there with me or i'll start going like brother um call names okay i enjoy that because my kids they know if they're not on attention when you're preaching that you're going to catch them out because we don't come here i don't come here to preach i don't come here i want to teach you something i want to show you something that might unlock a little bit closer to god this must be between you and god not between you the chair or the writing pad that you're writing on it must be between you and god so i'm going to go on with this because i've got notes there i just want to find my notes so here you go he says he stepped aside not to criticize not to analyze not to pull some leaves off the tree and take it down to a laboratory to see why them leaves don't burn he stepped to the side of the burning fire kindly reverently he approached it so your approach to what you get here or in fellowship or after fellowship or outside or whatever is so important if your approach is wrong you will not receive it he goes on to say god said take off your shoes moses and the ground that you stand on is holy okay it's holy ground this is this is a place where i'm going to deal with you but i want you to first show me respect you need to you need to do something first take off your shoes so what if was it so hard if i have to take off my shoes to approach god is that hard i'm not saying let's all take off our shoes when we get into church i think it will be a very smelly place but i think that if god asks you a simple thing to take your shoes off can you not do it the attitude back to god is going what gonna bring him on the scene now because he said you do that and i'll show you more but you need to do it you need to do it if you tell your wife i'll show you redemption if you tell your wife i'll show you healing our marriage is is healed sealed he's the middle of our marriage it's the best place to be as a christian i'm not saying we don't have our trials but everything's out in the open there's nothing the devil can come and say oh but you did this and you did this it's out so between me and my wife it's white as snow clean and god can work there because everything i had when he said to let it go i let it go i had no pride i had no other ins uh dry thoughts with it i didn't try to reason it i just did it i asked him sincerely back show me he showed me i did it if you do the same you will get the same rewards he says here the reason that the gifts in the church and the church the reason people don't get very much today is because the irreverent you approach it he said it like every irreverent you approach it god you've got to come with a full surrender made up mind amen amen you have to mean business yes he says and when you mean business and when you come to god and you don't haphazardly come just come to church to fall asleep on the chair and beat on the altar and have some chewing gum there is no way to come to god that's no way to come to god just come just the same as you can and mean what you are talking about god will receive you big words big words big words to say if you really mean business and you come at the altar i'm not making auto calls i'm i'm really trying to get some ground examples i think sometimes we really i might just say it brother ben forgive me you can maybe correct this later on you come to church brother ben you you speak a lot about it you come to church just to follow around you don't mean business you will not get blessed no matter if a preacher plea preaches here till he's blue in his face you will not get a blessing because you're not coming into that door meaning business with god god corrected me on this amen five minutes before the music place we show up band sorry you can you can say sorry later on you don't mean business you don't mean business because if there was really something in you that was looking for an answer from god you would be waiting here many a times ben is sitting here this man has grown so much in god praise the lord brother ben because at least he comes and he's expecting something he doesn't stop nobody said he's perfect but he sits and he waits on god and he prays and he waits and says to savvy the same and it's examples that's in our church and they pray and they wait and they pray and they wait and god delivers them and god talks to them and god helps them and god has changed this man to the man that came into this church to what he is today living testimonies your approach to god if your approach is not good you will never get it you will always sit in that view and you won't get anywhere with god and you will wonder why i missed it because your approach is wrong forgive me i love you all i don't mean it bad amen remember if you can take it back to god you'll be fine he says like moses on the big back side of the devil desert no matter how educated whatever had taken place he um his fears and frustrations left because he stood on the sacred grounds of god okay nobody could take it away from him if you try to argue with brother moses to say that bush was not god good luck too late if you want to argue yourself out of it go ahead go and argue me out brother ben asked us this question would he join this church he said what will you do if i as the pastor one day walk out and say this is all a lie what will you do no i put the same challenge back to you what if half the church tomorrow walks out of here what would you do what experience did you have with god where is your sacred ground where is your foundation where's your experience with god because i was in churches no man spoke like this i was trying to overcome spirit of lust never could do it i was cheating on my wife i was doing everything wrong i possibly could wrong nothing could deliver me from it until i met him not the message the message introduced me back to him i met him because he said armand you cannot live anywhere but outside of this pages you must be inside the book you must be indian if you do not find jesus christ in every scripture what are you doing and some of these scriptures i couldn't understand some of the words i can't even pronounce brother isaac helps me every now and again and brother andy they teach me what's like salubrious but at least i'm for real i'm for real and i know when god is telling me to do something i do it because you know what i want to grow closer to him and i want you to grow closer to him but you have to get real with god this church want to move forward you want to see healing you want to see miracles you want to see your children return you want to see little children coming to the kingdom all people come back get real with god don't play your man where did it come to play oh yeah it's too late amen we it's too late to step in church let you see an age everybody's falling asleep everybody's being allowed by the devil to sleep and nobody knows where the true word of god is increase of goods in need of nothing please somebody tell me who needs god in new zealand right come on they've got everything and said africa can't walk with you if i go tomorrow and i open my wallet and i walk down the hall of george street with 100 bucks or 200 bucks sticking out my wallet i will get to the supermarket buy my goods walk with all of them back to my car that i left open still get in my car store drive home nothing would happen how do i need god i'm not even scared man you do that in south africa you do it in another country it will be a whole new game we got witnesses this country don't need god so the whole country is falling asleep and the devil goes you're all fine you're doing good so many people you know precious brothers and sisters that is still potential seed of god that's out there we know and we are not doing our job to get them here in prayer you don't need to always compel them brother andy said a wonderful thing he says hey pray for the striving family we're busy fellowshipping with them pray for this truvi family and they'll go who's this to be family doesn't matter pray they need to come in pray we need to go on we need to go home they the names are in the book they might as well get in because they if he closes the book and he walks away it's done it says here there must be there must be a typos for all of you but once he takes that book and the plan of redemption is done it's gone there's no more mercy there's judgment this world's getting judged so i want to bring it to stephen and i hope i'm not too long it's 8 41 i still have 15 minutes i'm going to try to do it here's some types here i want to catch you with these ones i put pictures for the little ones hey um here the preaching of stephen so the the the mindset of the pharisees is still wrong so i said x729 so i'm just going to quickly go this i just quickly see no it's not that i got 49 sorry heaven is my throne and earth is my footstep where is the house that you build me save the lord or what is the place of my rest we know where it is it's in the believer hath not my hand made all these things he says ye stiff-necked and uncircumstantin is circumcised in heart and ears ye who always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so did ye and he wasn't lying god was taking over here this wasn't stephen speaking this was god speaking through stephen saying you always resist me because you're always looking for a way out and so of course they dragged him out because they got so angry dragged him out stoned him and before he died god says don't worry i've got you and he fall asleep and he and he saw jesus christ on the right hand of god so god rewards the believer no matter what they say rewards the believers he says now happen look at this guy standing here who can tell me young people young kids hands up who can tell me is that who didn't i ask rebecca it's saul or is it god paul you amen so saul's standing here he sees this event and something pricks in his heart and he goes bro this is wrong this is all just wrong he's a pharisee devout christian or devote loves the lord follows him reads his bible does all the rituals but he looks at the scene and he cannot he cannot figure it out but instead of turning his focus back to god and say god show me he goes to the scribes and pharisees and he says give me that documentation so i combined all these christians because no man should die by someone's feet again not for this jesus christ i'm just paraphrasing okay that's the thought i got when i looked at it so something pricked him and now he says i'm going to hit this hard i'm going to go against this message i'm going to show them you don't need to dress a certain way or act a certain way or do a certain thing to receive christ i'm going to hit that at the root of the tree but he hasn't met jesus christ while jesus christ is there right there living god okay they preached jesus christ he's still there stephen just spoke about everything that he'd done he just introduced the christ to them and then they stoned him for it so god's saying hey bro there's a way out and then they stoned the way out as they did all the other prophets he says and then philip now look at this now he gets angry and he starts persecuting the jews after the christians and he goes to all the synagogues kicks them out binds them throws them in jail and what happens to christians scatter they scatter as much as you're trying to cover the word the christians scatter so what happens philip in chapter 8 he goes and he goes to samaria and he goes preach jesus christ to them and they receive christ so as much as he's kicking against it god goes i don't mind i'll just keep on going because you know what this is my plan of redemption this is me doing the work as much as you tried to kill every prophet i'll just send another one i'll just send another messenger i've just seen another preacher i've just seen another brother to come and tell you gideon one more time i'm in control are you able to heal to it then philip goes and he preached jesus christ but i want to say there was a light in that city before philip came who can tell me who was that who was the light in samaria before yeah god bless you sister so because she had experience with god she went into samaria and she told them jesus christ did all these things told me the truth now here comes the minister of the gospel walks into the same city and says hey it's actually true i'm confirming what that sister was testifying so sister vanessa says god delivered me from depression amen i'm walking forth she's proclaimed a victory a pastor comes and says he wants to be delivered from process uh depression another sister goes it's me god strikes it the leaves delivers her from depression walk on somebody has to keep sowing the seeds a living god that is healing us and helping us my my god that young man there he was so sick seven doctors liam stein seven doctors didn't know what was going on with him he had warts and things he looked like this thing called there's an uh old movie hellboy it was things that pushed out of his head i think sister christine you saw all that rings in his body it was just a terrible state terrible state and brother ben comes behind the pulpit and he preaches healing and he testifies of our sister annalise which tongue tie was cut before the doctor touched her he says but i prayed and when i prayed was it the thunder was it the the birth it was the birth it was the birth when sister christine when you had that dream that that um uh gabby would be still birthed and then you guys prayed against it and brother ben forgot about it but when it all came sister bronwyn you were witness to that and the baby had to come out the channel and if it took longer it would have had a different turn but because they prayed against it it all just happened and she came out and he said because i prayed and i believed and we went on and god did the rest we went back home we put i'll never forget it i took liam's stand and i put him on the table like this and i said liam stayed enough is enough do you believe jesus christ can heal you i said we just heard this do you believe he said yesterday i can believe it i said can we pray with you and me and my wife had to get in one accord and get real with god so that he could receive his healing and he was healed three days later nothing no doctor touched him no medicine healed amen because we got real with god because before that testimony we kept doubting keep taking pictures keep saying oh god we'll heal but keep taking pictures whenever we're real with god we were just playing christianity when you're real with god and you really come with a real sincere heart you say lord please show me i'm desperate i need to know how can god not show you because he needs to prepare the ground here before he's going to give you that revelation i'm about to close hang in there children so mr paul he goes tall he goes on and he starts going to damascus and i'll just tell the story now but these are scripture if you want to go find it write it down because everything i say is in the word of god if it's the scriptures i mean that not not all the jokes and funny things just from read between the lines and he journeyed to damascus and he was going to go and he was going to attack these christian people because they just they lost the blood blood and paul in acts 9 3 i've got it highlighted so i'll just minus read it for you he says and he journeyed and he came to damascus and suddenly there was a light shine about around him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth sometimes we need a moment where we fall to the earth and he heard the voice saying unto him saw saul why persecuted cutest tell me now listen to this and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus who who you persecute um is it hard for thee to kick against the pricks and here verse six it says and and he trembling and astonish said lord what would you have me do that means this meeting with god was more than just a just a light shining from a roof he wouldn't call any other thing lord he was a cr he was a jew devout jew he will not call anything else but this moment had him in such a place where he had fear and he knew that god was now dealing with him and he says look at his response what would you what would you want me to do not how can i get around this or is it really you as a team is it another come on man he got real with god and says lord what would you want me to do and he knew that this sovereign almighty god has just come his way and started dealing with him not not anything else god but i want you to catch this and win them and and and then he arrives he says arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what you must do so paul saul gets struck down and god he could give him the answer right now he can go to him and say this is your answer you're healed amen okay and i believe it as well and and you delivered and all those things you can give him the answer right now and he goes no no i want you to go the city i want someone to deal with you why would god do that have you ever thought about it i've said it the previous time why would god choose man to come and give him his next instructions have you actually thought about it when god is first person speaking to him why doesn't he just tell him what to do why would god do that because god chose the gospel to be preached by man and to be lived by man because the gospel of jesus christ the plan of redemption is for man not for trees not for birds though they will benefit from everything it's for man so god chooses a preacher maybe chooses a preacher to prepare a message to come stand here on a sunday to come and tell you he's not in trouble he was actually just thinking of something i wanted to get his attention to come and tell you something to say you know what abe that thing that you've been asking me all week here's your answer preacher doesn't know what goes between you and god he's just having a message and he's sharing it but if you really sincerely know the gospels are dealing with a a spirit that's upon you a depression a need of healing a place where you're really at where you need help from god he knows when to get your attention but are you prayed up when you come here are you looking for your answer amen i know you guys are tired i'm almost there but one thing that happened he says and when which they joined and i said and the men which joined with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man so they didn't get blinded by this gospel it's a perfect type if you really think about it he blinds him to the jews and then he goes and gives you slightly by the gentiles and he starts preaching jesus christ to the gentiles so he says i'm done with your jews blind him to all those doctrines and everything i'm going to make his eyes open to jesus christ and he's going to preach it to the gentiles perfect time amen his jesus is everywhere and i'm gonna rap over this i think we'll just leave it there because it is oh i've got eight more minutes i'm gonna go for it okay everybody stand up stand up amen we need to yep and sit down amen the one thing is there is no rules and textbooks when it comes to god when god is coming your way he's going to do it anyways as long as you enjoy the journey these things are not to be preaching at you these things says if you really look hard enough and you go and you go read your bible and you say lord show me you can spend one chapter i promise you you can be on one chapter one the same chapter for a whole year and you will still not touch the size of it brother branham used to preach or paul job he was sitting on the airship so long they're asking can you get him off the airship who shared that with me just recently brother before he says oh brother you know you were poor job he was on the airship so long can you please get him off because he's feeling sorry for him already but you can't you can't exhaust it there's too much of him so here we go here's a here's a nice scene okay and i think i'll close with this because i want to encourage you i'm not here to try to make you feel sorry and create the emotion i want to encourage you that if you approach god if you really approach god like a for real life person you will get a for real life response because the gospel is real the rest of this world is all fake might have never seen so many fake lips eyes lipstick dudes everything if you want to see fake just walk out in the street there's enough fake out there there's not enough originals out there why do you want to enhance yourself if you're beautiful already come on man men you handsome i mean dude it's different you know call a man beautiful but think about it why if god has made you everything you are do you want to go try and make yourself different for what reason because then there must be vanity or something must be behind it there must be another spirit behind it to want you make to go another way because god said you're perfect as i made you there's nothing wrong with you and by the way who's looking like like sister and i'll just well well i'll explain to you sustaina okay there's two types of cars in this world there's a souped-up car dropped suspension maxed all the way out and i'll do it talk because i'm a boy i don't know how to do it go talk so just try to follow me this thing when it goes over the bump it makes sparks it sounds like the bee's knees the exhausted so big kids can play in it it looks the part sounds the part has most of the parts but nothing beats the original so if you go 1963 ferrari and you go google that that's the first of its kind of those sports cars those guys that cause is that the 1963 brotherhood for 64. 63 64. and that's just how much i know beautiful car but nobody goes buy a 21 million or how many ever dollar car and then go drop the suspension put this massive exhaust on it everything there because the value of the car is beautiful as it is so why do you want to add to value which if you're already invaluable there's no value on you greater than the blood of god the life of god for you let god sovereign god come and pay the the most deepest price for you to say i love you the way you are and then you want to go and follow some lies of the devil to say you have to look a certain way act a certain way dressed a certain way you're selling yourself cheap man because god already said you're beautiful just as you are you don't need perversion so these three they hang on the cross jesus christ in the middle and the two thieves and i want to i want to kind of get this get this get this approach the two thieves are going at him and it says here i got the scripture he said and this and the superscription also that was written over him in letters in greek and in latin and in hebrew this is the king of the jews so massive thing going on but now don't look at the scene let's try to see the unseen right now let's see let's read in between the lines now and one of the male vectors which was hanging railed on him saying if they'll be the christ save thyself and save us still not getting it still same attitude same way he's not really looking for christ he's not looking he's on the cross he goes i'm gonna die so i might as well while i'm gonna die i'm gonna do it this way so you know if i'm gonna die i'm gonna die in a blaze of glory why die in a blaze of glory if you can walk in the rapture have you ever thought about it hey boys are you awake do you need to die in a blaze of glory why you don't need to you can walk into heaven you know no other men except elijah was into heaven and enoch and jesus christ and the saints went off there's not a lot of people that can do that but any other guy can die in the blaze of glory don't let the world trick you boys that's not your part he says and one of the male factors in the world and he will say save thyself or save us but the other answer rebuked him he says bro wake up something's about to happen something's happening to this man and you're not looking with your spiritual eyes you're only looking at church eyes because you only want the service to finish so that you can go home look up eternal life is being imparted here something greater is going to take place here but they're looking at everything else is what where they're supposed to be looking and he says and indeed justify we receive our due reward in our deeds and this man has done nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord he caught it lord remember we when you come into thy kingdom because he had a moment where he looked at it he just stopped he just stopped and he said you know what i'm missing something here is this feeling saying i kind of need to do this is something in me saying the devil is lying to me trying to trick me trying to get me on his side trying to say the gospel is not true i'm just sitting in church wasting my breath i'll never get into heaven i'll never understand this message i'll never understand the gospels i'll never meet jesus christ i won't be married i won't get a husband i won't get a wife brother marion you will get a wife you will get a wife brother david you will get a wife because you know what god wants you to be happy and it doesn't matter what the devil tells you don't listen to him no matter what you do because once you start agreeing with the devil you are on his ground and you will go like this every day i'm saying this to the young people because you know what is your greatest challenge young people is to follow god find a good wife find a steady job find a good house i know i was there you really want to just have stability you want stability in your life seek god seek god first you want stability you want the perfect wife out there for you you pray god sends her he will send her if you if you should be married you'll be married if you should have a house you'll have a house if you want a ferrari you'll give you a ferrari just remember when you ask for it how you ask and what if you're actually seeking his will or your will okay i'll stop there maybe i'll touch some points there and jesus said to unto unto him very very i sound to thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise so psalms 85 7-11 show us thy mercy o lord and grant us thou salvation i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to unto his saints but let them not turn again to folly did you catch that you ask god for an answer he tells you what to do do it do not turn back to folly surely his salvation is nigh to them that fear him amen don't be scared just be reverent amen that's right and i'll close almost like seeing died behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming and the great grateful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers i just want to ask you something have you actually look at the pillar of fire look at brother branham you look at the scene you go oh you know it could be a light at the back it could be a bulb in there in the roof like some people claim it could be whatever you want it to be have you actually asked him to reveal you the significance of this scripture in your life have you actually seen how privileged we are amen i see a lot of christians out there and i mean it with a sincere heart that sincerely is serving god and it's sincerely wrong come on let's be honest i'm not saying they don't love god but they took a little bit of men a little bit of god form the denomination little bit of man a little bit of god form the denomination and separated from the truth do you really want to be separated from the truth if god can point you back to the word to the word i don't say the message listen to me the word so young people you struggle to overcome why old people we struggle to to claim our promises i can't say i'm old i'm not 40 plus so i can i can say that i can't ever other people so so i'm not saying anybody is real old but are you struggling so if you're struggling isn't our approach a bit wrong here so if the light struck the lens if god has made his imprint on you saying hey i've put you i've brought you into truth if you've done that for you what's your response positions if you want to come up what's your what's your response to god if he said he said like all these witnesses there that seem god what's your response if god says there's more to this than meets man's eyes what's your response how should it be you come to church to come and fall asleep children mr malachi you're not asleep i just say because i got your attention i like it brother it works helium why do we come to church boys sisters you know i'll share a little bit of martin and i'll close with that you can maybe play some nice music there in the background sister christine because it always softens the blow it does it does help i'm going to be i'm going to very honest i only have a brother armand moment here with you who believes in healing can i see it with a uplifted hand okay who believes in salvation [Music] okay who believes in miracles who wants to see it musicians who wants to see you want to see miracles change your approach no i think we are but at that time we don't come into church and we muck about i know we don't have the most perfect sanctuary we don't have the most perfect church thank you brother bean for always standing for that thank you god bless you always say guys let's keep it quiet in the sanctuary he's always the one that says let's talk outside he can say it all the time but do we really mean business with god who wants to see limbs grow back who wants to see stokes valley peoples lining up on this door seeing god healing and delivering them their souls well don't you think if we start getting a bit more sincere with god we start coming here children prayed up children not parents this gospel is not for parents god is not a granddad children coming in here you remember that camp with those sisters brother ed you put them there at the pulpit they were crying crying for god i had my son praying for his friends there he is witness say god deliver my friends we cannot see miracles in this church if we keep playing church [Music] come on man i want to see the supernatural i've got a desire to see more of god experience more of god i think the time is at that time where the church of of the living god takes that next step and say okay god we are here to mean business let's do business that's right yes sir so i'm gonna maybe say it as it is musicians if you're not in time for band lose your spot church starts when it starts if you're here or not the violent take it by force the ones that want to see miracles will go and get the miracles deacons you hear try to be as when you can i'm not giving you a preaching don't get me wrong brothers and sisters come here to mean business with god you will not get anywhere with the haphazard walk amen brother ben forgive me but i i think it's time that we pull up our socks and we get ready with god and sincere with god i remember a time when i got here in church [Music] when i got here in church and sister vanessa would break in in tongues or sister christine will will speak in tongues there were people in church and god would come and sister bronwyn would prophesy and speak in tongues and god will come down and give the interpretation and you could see god working in our life god didn't just say hey come here come here hallelujah praise the lord it was straight to our church it was it was saying hey i've got instruction i've got to work for you we had prayer meetings where the presence of god would come off and come down and just go through the whole room and it will be so tangible brother andy first time i ever prayed in my house was here in stokes valley i ever really prayed in my house it was with brother ben and brother um andy in my house when they said we want to have a pre-meeting there and god moved mightily mightily my dad and mom came here their life was in turmoil you go ask them one day satan did a real good job on them i needed some help i was only a year in this message i went outside i said god i've listened to your prophet preach when when when i need you i can call you on a conference it was raining i'll never forget that day never i said lord i don't know your scriptures i don't i don't know all of them i'm new but i know that if i call you on a conference you will come and you will back me up and i promise you the very next day was a saturday that me and my dad had a good chat the very next day brother ben comes and he talks and he opens up the law and he's speaking about moses law and he speaks about god and the relationship between husband and wife and me my dad just spoke about it and he heals my dad he gets my dad's attention because why i meant business i wanted my dad's salvation so badly that i would do anything i will go to outside my house the neighbors can see me this side the neighbors can see me that side i didn't care i was praying i said god crying help me i'm desperate amen god don't come on the scene if you just haphazardly say things you have to mean business [Music] i was so far out of my depth my dad used to preach the gospel he did you ask me now today go behind my back talk to my dad he knew the scriptures but he didn't knew the author but he wanted to know him but he needed a moment and i recognize that there is a time where i as the son of god cannot play anymore because if i want deliverance i need to mean business [Music] and he came and he did the work it wasn't nothing that i did he came and he did the work and i got delivered and he got delivered and he even rebuked me in the same services says if you ever treat someone with temple like that you could cost him this salvation god deals with all of us he doesn't just go oh it's for him and for him for you it's so personal i want to see supernatural i want to see god every day in my life but i feel we kind of let the the belt go a bit loose have relaxed a little bit got a bit in the lady you see in spirit [Music] what's a little bit too much youtube i'm just going to put this down if you want to pray you pray tonight i think we'll we'll end with a premier tonight okay but i want to ask you something do you mean business with god hallelujah do you really mean business of god if you really do then tonight is your night where you go god show me you live show me you do miracles ruben lo you want to see miracles bro get real with god you want to see salvation for your friends keep getting real with god don't have to work yourself up get real with god amen you want to preach the gospel you want to go out there and do god of justice you want to go do god a work you talk to god you get real with god you don't understand this message get real with god you don't know where you stand in the bible and which scripture you are in get real with god amen let that light come and strike your heart and show you who you really are so i encourage you let's all pray together tonight but get real with god look the world is the world is the world will always be the world and one day this world will be burned down and it'll be gone doesn't matter if you could play piano or violin or the most beautiful guitar doesn't matter any of this would not matter the day we step into glory get real with god [Music] you want to see supernatural get real with god [Music] so let us just close in the word of prayer if you want to lift up your hand or whatever you would do this is your time with god because remember all these saints of before and keep your heads down and your eyes closed please all these saints of before when god came their way something happened all these saints sitting in here in this church tonight testimonies upon testimonies had a time where they got real with god and they started their walk in this gospel but brothers and sisters we should not stop there if you have stopped if you've got loose if you have dropped your guard if you're busy feeding off the tree of knowledge and not the tree of life if you are looking in the wrong places and not really seeking god i don't know many anything mention anything about the message i didn't mention anything about even the word i'm talking you sincerely wanting a time with god following god where he wants to lead you don't you think tonight is a real time to go and ask him to forgive you to open your eyes as saul was blinded and then open his eyes as paul don't you want to be the one that sees every jesus christ in every scripture don't you want to see the miracles when you talk to someone at work and the holy ghost falls and salvation is imparted is it beyond the scriptures if you really want to see god move tonight let's make right with god let's mean business with god i will lead you into prayer i will take my mic off and we all can pray together you don't need to pray loud but i want you to have a real sincere moment with god right now right now musicians as you play you can pray if you don't want to play don't mind just pray anyways because it's more important than anything else now is god help me so i'll start us off and you pray at your own time i just want to say lord jesus i didn't think the service was going to go this way i'll be honest and you know my heart i knew that i knew that this wasn't a closed service father and it was open because you were gonna take preeminence and i was really hoping that you would lord and i thank you for this and once again you've showed me that lord you can even teach me while i'm standing here when i'm right or when i'm wrong lord lord i ask that you would forgive me in the name of jesus christ and our brothers and sisters right here tonight lord that you would help us to look at the unseen and not the seen to state the the miracle working god lord and not the not the unbelieving spirit that tries to possess us lord lord i ask that every brother and sister tonight would sincerely look in their hearts father look at their timetable tonight lord and see if they are spending time in the word or they're spending time elsewhere lord i know lord that we do many things wrong but we expect miracles father we ask for all these wonderful things that you promise us yet we play lord and we mock like brother ben said on easter camp i ask that you would forgive us for that lord jesus and may your the blood of jesus christ the ultimate sacrifice that was made for our sins lord our iniquities our chastisement lord the chastisement was upon you lord by our stripes you were healed father oh by your stripes we were healed sorry lord i ask that you would just see what i mean may that blood of jesus christ come down lord might come upon us now lord jesus may the holy spirit talk to each one of us right now lord may you reveal to us lord what we're doing wrong may you reveal to us what we should do father lord i don't want to i want to i want a moment with you lord tonight i want a moment with you tonight and say lord please examine my heart father examine my timetable examine my motives examine lord everything about me i lay myself on the altar for night tonight lord and i say lord search me father search me and see where i am going wrong father lord because i want your holy presence in my life every day i want to breathe and i want to sleep and i want to eat and i want to see christ live in my life every day i don't want to dwell in a carnal realm lord i don't want to dwell in the realm when the supernatural doesn't matter i want to be in that heavenly place with you lord jesus lord where you can deal with me lord and when the brother comes my way lord you can deal with him lord because we're all here for one reason one reason that oh lord is you to glorify you who gives you all father iniquities give me all my wrongdoings forgive me all my wasting time and getting distracted forgive me lord if you need to speak to us your children are here we're listening lord i had lifted up hands here lord all of us believe in the supernatural all of us believe in the living god all of us believe in the power of god father we are here to hear from our king lord lord from the king of kings lord speak to us where have we gone off the wayside lord we have we fallen [Music] all there is a asl that's hindering us father so unforgiveness all misunderstanding and hear it our father lord if there's any sin here that's not confessed may it be confessed and made me go and go a brother and a sister may they've been asking for for forgiveness father are you dealt with with me as well or maybe not be scared to go out and say lord deal with me i've gone wrong i need your help god i need your help oh lord i've got an heart and canister i don't understand my brother or sister and i'm jealous and i've got strife and there is [Music] [Music] day i need a um lord i don't want to leave you like this lord i want to be a man that can stand here and say i preach the gospel i live the gospel i eat the gospel i am the gospel of jesus christ because christ lives me i want no hindrance [Music]
