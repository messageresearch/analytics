good morning Hallelujah good morning amen let's go to Song of Solomon again chapter 2 I want to actually read so I want to continue continue from uh where I was speaking about uh last Sunday about the voice of my beloved trust that he is your beloved today and uh I just want to read well we're going to read from verse one down to verse 14 it's pretty much the whole verse then we're going to go to Amos chapter 8 so so song of suin chapter 2 verse one I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys as the Lily among Thorns so my lovers among the daughters as the apple tree among the Trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons I sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste he brought me to his banqueting table and His Banner Over Me was love stay with me flaggin Comfort me with apples for I am sick of love has has left hand is under my head and his right hand does embrace me I charge you oh you Daughters of Jerusalem by the rose and by the Hinds of the field that you stir not up nor awake my love till he pleased the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountain skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a row or a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall he lookth forth at the window showing himself through the lattice my beloved spake and said to me rise up my love my fair one and come away for Lo the winter has passed and the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth uh the time of singing of birds has come and the voice of the turtle which is the turtle do has heard in our land the Fig Tre putteth forth her green figs and the vines uh with the tender grapes give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one come away oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs Of The Rock in the secret places of the the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and th countenance is comely and we'll go to Amos chapter 8 I'm going to read verse um we're going to read verses 11 down to verse 13 and this is quite a contrast but I want to um just take a thought from these and then we'll then you can have your seat so so Amos 11 I mean 8 Amos 8: 11 wait I'm in Hosea okay so it says here behold the days come sayith the Lord God remember we read he brought me to his Banting table and His Banner Over Me was love behold the days come sayith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor of thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from North even to the East and they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it and that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated now this is a bit of a I know it's two very contrasting scriptures cuz one we have a banqueting T I mean no he brought me to his banqueting house he brought me to the banqueting house and His Banner Over Me was love so one's a banquet and the other we're speaking of a place where there's a famine not for not for bread or water so not for natural food but of hearing the words of the Lord and so I want to you know people I don't know if you've really maybe you've realized maybe this is just me but I really want to try and emphasize today you know we have visitors come where have people come and they say it's so wonderful and what you have is so special and it's such a blessing to be here you know and they travel thousands of miles from from other continents and they come here to this little place I say it's so nice now the this doesn't make this place special but it's wherever the banqueting hous is amen amen that's where there's the refreshing that's where there's the feast but the reason that people have to travel such great vast distances is because there is a famine in the land and it's not for bread or water there's plenty of bread or water I read a report the other day that the Earth right now it produces 120% of the food that the world actually needs but the problem is it's it's the distribution of the food which causes the problems but the Earth is producing the way more food 7 billion people upon the Earth and it's producing more than 7 billion people need so it's not a famine for bread or water but it's that's hearing the words of the Lord but so it's not it's not it's not a famine for having Bibles or it's not famine for having Bible schools or theology or some understanding or churches but it's hearing the words of the Lord hallelujah amen that is the famine where there's very few places there's a a spiritual famine upon the land is because the words of the Lord are not heard the words of the Bible school might be heard or the Social Gospel but the words of the Lord that that that is famine and that's why when people travel amen hey I'm just showing you this scripture you've seen it lived out where people come to a place like this or go to any any church where Believers are where the word of God has preached that's so nice here it's so refreshing it's so wonderful why because they're walking through a desert Place amen and then they come to an oasis and they can sit down under the under the shade trees and then brother Bram says it's like the rest of you know you know he preaches a sermon on the restoration of the brid tree and he goes into Joel how that same bug in different stages eats down that eats down the Plant and and in four stages we won't go into it but but you can go read it and listen to this sermon and then he says part of that that so so the devil over the process of time has taken different things out of the church and one of them was the brotherly love the brotherly kindness you know the fellowship and when do you normally have Fellowship where it's nice and cool and relaxing amen we can have a rest under a big big Shady Tree he said the devil's chewed that out of the church that's right but God said I will restore amen and then so people come they say it's so nice why they found a shap tree amen they found a place where there's Fellowship people can actually have Fellowship amen they've been in a desert and so there was a famine in the land now this I just just I just pray the Lord help me again this week but we are living in a time where there's this famine and if there's a famine but but there is a banqueting table and so now what it is now it's not because we've conjured something up or because we're something special but it's because God has opened a stor House of his food spiritual food remember man shall not live by bread alone but every word that comes out of the mouth of God doesn't mean people live by theology or man shall live by just reading scripture now don't get me wrong here you need the Bible but you need the right interpretation of the Bible Jesus said searchy scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me so they had the Bible they read the Bible they knew the Bible but they had no idea really they they couldn't actually access what was in the Bible is this okay you're following me so so they couldn't actually so they thought they had eternal life because they could read what Moses wrote or they could read what Ezekiel even what Amos wrote and and they thought they had eternal life but they didn't have eternal life even though they could quote the scripture amen amen so even in Jesus's day they had the synagogues they had the temple they had the priests they had the Pharisees the Sadducees they had the Bible written out they could go to the synagogue they could you know and apparently people could read a lot in those days so they could even read the Torah but it didn't give them eternal life amen they were still those people if you could and if you go to this day people are emaciated starving to death spiritually in this world cuz there's a famine and so it's more than just reading the Bible but then you need to read the Bible cuz you got to give God something to work with as I said a couple of Sundays Go's like an athlete and his coach you know berates the you know the guy he fails the race or he can't even finish the race and the coach says you're useless you're worthless why didn't you even finish the race and the athlete could say hey you're my coach did you train me no did you give me the right diet no you didn't give me anything to work with amen so it's the same thing you got to give God something to work with you got to that's why you need to read the word and listen to the word and pray you know brother B was asked a question how do you become a better Christian read the Bible and pray every day amen you got to give God something to work with you got to feed your soul amen if you if you don't feed your body you're going to wither up and die and you won't have strength to do anything it's the same thing the spirit of God feeds on the word so the spirit in you I trust you have the Holy Ghost it feeds on the word amen and if you and normally people that are growing they eat more than they need yeah plants drinking more water than they need and they drink they just push out more limbs yeah so it's the same thing with the believer you want to grow just drink and then push out the life in you will grow amen amen now I trust this doesn't this comes out okay but so we're in this famine time and that's why people go to and fro and there's a famine not for churches not for watching sermons on the internet you know there's more this world is more saturated with Christianity than it ever has been in the history of the world it is more because of the internet because of social media because just churches everywhere you can go on YouTube you can you can spend your entire life watching sermons but then you got to look at now what are they feeding on that they're giving to the people what food are these people feeding and then you look at the condition now remember you say well that's judging no you should be able to weigh up if I walk in here and tell you that Jesus isn't real we've believed a lie my whole testimon is wrong this is not a real he's not the same yesterday today and forever you would you would think something's wrong with me amen but then other people say well you just judging the preacher no you're just being Discerning you should be able to judge is this person dangerous or is he my friend is he here to help me or is he here to destroy me amen and then so you look at the concentration camps in World War II you would look at those guards and say those guards have been mistreating these people but then you can take that thing over to Christianity and people say you just judging those people you have no right to judge the ministry but look at what they're producing amen and then of course this Falls very much on my lap too what is being produced cuz what is sown what you s you'll reap so you're not going to if you seow pumpkin seeds you're not going to get wheat that's right if you sew pumpkin seeds you get pumpkins 100% of the time every time you sew potato you get potato and you shouldn't be surprised when you get potatoes I was expecting a pumpkin well what did you s a potato how can you expect the pumpkin that's right yeah so it's the same thing if you have the word of God if you can hear the word of the Lord and that is sewn in your life what are you going to get out you're are going to get that word manifested in you hallelujah amen but if you're living on a McDonald's diet spiritually you're going to become like the super siiz me guy very quickly amen and then people are shocked when they're you know but that is that is a spiritual condition of this world is a famine and unfortunately it's not the the people are sincere in that system doesn't matter you go Hong to the Catholic Church the whole Spectrum it's the it's it's not the people it's the system that's holding the people back many very sincere people in all those places very sincere maybe even more sincere than us but yet and they think they're contacting God by going to those places every church every church people would go I got to worship God doesn't matter what form it's in but they believe that's why people go to church I trust is to worship the true and living God and so they're sincere when they go but you see what is produced after they go to that place amen is it the character and nature of God that can cope with his word or is it just a reflection of whatever is coming over the pulpit amen so I can say there's a famine because if there wasn't a famine the world would be a very different place amen if the whole world heard the word of the Lord you say well why doesn't the whole world world he it it's because they had an opportunity and many times it's not this generation it's always now I may be jumping around a bit but I trust you just keep my training thought the people in this day and churches out there that are starving it's actually not their fault they're in that condition it's many times the generation of leaders before them which have rejected the truth and they what what what they swed these people are creeping you can see it in Jesus's day Paul said to the scribes and Pharisees this thing wasn't done in a corner of jesus' ministry you know fully well what happened and they did but they rejected the Prince of Life and then it was what 60 odd years later is when Jerusalem was burned and the people were massacred where when when Titus surrounded the city and and it was just before the Passover and they let all the Jews come in to worship and then they sealed up the place and they burned it with fire and murdered a whole bunch of them massacred the whole place so they reaped what their forebears sow remember Jesus said not one of these stones will be left upon another speak of the temple he said this will happen you read Matthew 24 but it was the future Generations that were reaping what the previous ones were SE it amen and so if you see why is there a famine is because the previous generations of leadership rejected the very Prince of Life and these this generation is suffering amen hey it is what it is it is what it is and you can see it you can take you take I'll just say you you you take the elim the New Life elim Church here in New Zealand they had a meeting maybe 30 years ago in Christ Church what shall we do with this message and they and they came to the conclusion burn the books tell everyone that they he's a false prophet and that's what they did so they had the opportunity but they burnt it they they crucified the word again amen and that's exactly remember Revelations 3 l seeing Church age behold I stand at the door and knock now many Evangelical you your evangelist knock at your heart and that is true but the true interpretation of that scripture is actually he's on the outside of his church knocking trying to get in he's been rejected how do you kick someone out you got to reject them please leave my house now you're not welcome here anymore and that's exactly what happened if it happened at his first coming it happened at his second coming the word has been rejected and so if he remember he said to the said to the Jews I I am the bread of life that come down from heaven cuz cuz remember they said our fathers ate man in the wilderness we drank from the smitten rock and all these things he says I am that bread I am the bread that came down from heaven so here is the bread he is the bread of life is he not amen amen he is the bread of life so if you if you remove the very one thing you need to eat to spiritually live and grow what is your diet going to be it's not going to be growing like you should be it'll be a substitute and the substitute never produces what the real should be amen amen now I just pray by the end of the service you appreciate a whole lot more what God has allowed you to partake in this end time now so there is a famine now let's go to Genesis chapter 3 now this may end up a lot different to how I envisioned it but that's Genesis chapter 3 the end of the chapter so we'll just read verse 22 we'll read down and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now least he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so notice it says least he put forth and take the tree of life so he had actually man had never actually partaken of that tree yet say lest he has and then notice the cherubim and the Flaming sword was put there to not to keep the tree of life but to keep the way to keep the way of the tree of life so the access to the tree of life has been kept yeah it's a big difference from keeping and keeping the way so the way has been kept so the access to the tree of life has been kept now remember the Tree of Life the tree of life is Jesus Christ yeah because there's only one source of eternal life amen amen amen so there's only one source of eternal life and that is Jesus Christ now so therefore I can say the tree of life is Jesus Christ and so now the way the way to access eternal life has been kept and now I just want to make a big jump let's go to let's go to Ezekiel chapter 10 I'm just going to read some scriptures and then we'll I want to show you that this cherubim because the way the way has been kept all the way down through from Genesis to today the way is being kept and many people may you may hear this and say well it's not fair everyone has a right to go in don't look at it that way you say thank God I have access thank God I'm allowed to go in amen so Ezekiel chapter 10 and we'll read from verse one and then I looked and beheld in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims were appeared over them as it were a SA fir Stone as the appearance of a of the likeness of a throne and he spake unto the son I mean sorry unto the man clothed with linen said go in Between the Wheels which are under the Cherub and fill thine hand with Co of fire uh from between the cherubims and Scattered them over the city and he went um and he went in in my sight and now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house and when the man went in the cloud filled the inner Court then the glor glory of the Lord went up from the Cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory and the sound of the cherubim's Wings Was Heard even to the outer Court as the voice of the almighty God when he speaketh and it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen saying take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheels and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire which was between the cherubims and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it and went out and there appeared in the cherubs cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings and when I looked and beheld the Four Wheels by the cherubims one wheel by one cherub and another Wheel by another cherub and the appearance of the wheels as it were the color uh of a barrel Stone and as for their appearances they four had one likeness as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel when they went they went upon their four sides they turned not as they went but to the place where the the head looked they followed it and they turned not as they went and their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels uh that they for had as for the wheels and it Cried unto them in my hearing oh whe and every face everyone had four faces now this is where I really want to get to here everyone had four faces the first face was a face of a cherub the second was the face of a man the fourth uh the face of a lion I sorry the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle and and the cherubs were lifted up this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chiba now don't get I know that's a lot in there but this is the same being that he saw in chapter one because he's by the river chibar and he saw the same cherubim come out but you see now they have four faces they have a man a lion an eagle and then that face of a cherub now if we go to Revelations chap 4 that face actually the face of an ox okay so this cherub that had the that was protecting the way there in Genesis now Ezekiel sees it in a greater way here in Ezekiel well you can read chapter one but save time we won't and also chapter 10 he SE these cherubs here so then now these these cherubs they go from keeping the way there and then if we had time we could go into how Israel camped around the Tabernacle in the wilderness and then in the tabernac in the wilderness there were three tribes the north side three tribes on the south and the East and the west and there was a head tribe over each of those points and the banner on each tribe was a man and I a man a lion an ox and an eagle and so we're showing now for in order for someone to get into the Tabernacle where the prin of God was they had to fight their way through the armies of Israel so they had to be granted access through the the tribes in order to get to the tree of life you can say because it's his presence amen so it's always been protected where his life is remember his life is the Tree of Life Christ is the tree of life but the way is always been protected he following me okay so now let's go to let's go to Revelations chapter 4 now there going to be a bit of reading here but then we'll tie it all together now we got to Revelations chapter 4 and remember let's just read from verse one so it says after this I looked remember after this what the church ages now John is lifted up into an eternal realm so when the church age is over now there's a time where John is lifted up and sees Eternal things now we're still talking about spiritual food okay so after this I looked and beheld the door was open in heaven and remember that door remember John in the Book of Revelation is a symbol of the Bride yeah so at the end of the church ages he is raptured up so that he says now um after this I looked and beheld the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I'll show you these things which must be Hereafter so the voice that spoke with him through the church ages now is speaking from heaven and he's lifted up from being in this realm into an eternal realm and immediately he AR in the spirit and beheld a throne was sit in heaven and one sat on the throne and he as it were to um and he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and a siding Stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in the sight um in sight like unto an emerald and round about the throne with 4 and 20 seats and upon the seats I Saw 4 and 20 Elders sitting clothed them with white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like un Crystal and in the midst of the throne round about The Throne were four beasts and that is actually living creatures that word Beast there is living creature full of eyes before and behind which we've read about Ezekiel and the first Beast was like a lion the second beast was like a calf the third Beast had the face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come now so the cherubim now is now here in Revelations chapter 4 and then if we go into Revelations chapter 6 I want to show you now when the seals are open and the Antichrist rides forth it says I well let's just read it uh Revelation chapter 6 and verse one and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see now we'll go down to verse three and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see remember this Beast this word Beast is living creatures living creatures and when I heard the third when he opened the third seal verse 5 I heard the third Beast say come and see okay and then now we go down to the fourth seal which is verse S and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see well are these four beasts we read about them in Revelations chapter 4 there the first was like a lion the second beast was like a cal there's a cheram speaking now the third Beast had the face as a man and the fourth beast beast pardon me was like a flying eagle now when the Antichrist power rid forth like in the first seal there that was the Antichrist Spirit moving forth to conquer the church through deception yeah and so now to combat that God said sent an anointing of the lion upon the church to overcome the false doctrine that was coming forth yeah and so every time and then after that that second seal now instead of a a Antichrist Spirit of deception riding forth then there's a then then the rider went on to a red horse and was given a big sword and he and he and came out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and then was given unto him a great sword so went from a false false Doctrine coming in a deception coming in and then when after the Council of NAIA when church and state were United then the church had the power of the state to use the the state's armies to to kill its enemy yep so and you go look in history there goes a time where it was a false Doctrine comes in and then there's a massive persecution what is that now he's killing with the sword yeah but then the church was anointed because that second beast had the face of a of a cal yeah so now what is a c it's a beast of burden it's a beast of sacrifice so the Believers were anointed same Holy Spirit in a different way that they could easily you read the fox's book of Mars you read about the people in the that were in the uh Coliseum they were so happy that they could suffer and die for their Lord's sake they just rejoiced in it why is that because our anointed in such a way that they could overcome what the enemy was doing amen so so the Lord sent a power to combat what the enemy was doing and that was to protect the way of the tree of life amen okay Amen to protect the way this all coming together and then you can even and then and all the way down through that's why there's the four beasts so whenever the enemy is doing something God anoints the church in a certain way to protect the way of the tree of life and also that that the church will overcome what the enemy is doing remember to him that overcometh every Pro every age is given a promise to him that overcometh I'll give you this and our promise is to him that overcometh you'll sit in my Throne as I've sat down on my father's throne and that overcoming is not just overcoming smoking drinking the world whatever that overcoming is to overcome what the enemy is doing in this age can you overcome the Antichrist spirit amen amen that is the overcoming if you can withstand what the is doing let's all be one let's just have a Social Gospel let's go back to Rome that's what the world is pushing nowadays right and so can you overcome because it looks so good there's going to be Unity again it's been nearly over over a thousand years there's been a split and everyone's coming back together and we can christianize the whole world look at the resources that's on tap it looks so good but can you overcome it can you overcome oh just just just relax and just you know become one of us don't be so crazy that's right we live in a modern era things have moved on the gospel's moved on you got to stay relevant to stay with the times no you don't you preach the real word and then the power that's in that word will affect the people and it'll change them amen if it's not the word keeping us nothing can remember he is the word amen so we don't have to try and work it out just believe what he has done and what he has sent and it will produce what God wants to produce remember this word has a life of its own I don't know if you realized that but Jesus Christ has his own agenda he has what he wants done he he's not interested in what you want done he wants what he wants done and then those that can overcome yield their will to his will not my will but thy will be done amen if that's what Jesus said it's sure what you've got to have in your heart too amen not my will but thy will be done and if you can do that then you can overcome amen amen hey the gospel doesn't change doesn't matter it's it it's unpopular today it was unpopular then and it'll always be unpopular so now God anoints his church to overcome what's happening in the age and then and then he also does that he anoints it a certain way because he's protecting the way to the tree of life and so there's an anointing comes upon the Earth and those people that are granted access I trust you can say I'm one of them amen if this if this coming to church is all all to you is just hearing something and learning something new maybe singing a nice song you've missed the whole thing I mean you've missed the whole thing but if it's life to you and you can say from from whenever you first heard the truth Something's Happened to you and God is transforming you then I can say you've been granted access if something's happened to you and now your life has been changed you've been granted access amen amen and you can even see it in the gospels you can see the four cherums in the gospels Matthew is written different to Mark it's different it's written different to Luke it's written different to John and people say that's just the personality of the writer no it's not God anointed them to write in such a way you can see Matthew you can see the lion anointing the word being fulfilled he did this that it might be fulfilled he was born here that it might be fulfilled this happened on this wise that it might be fulfilled and then and then Mark it just goes straight into his Works straight into his doings what's that an ox works and then Luke is all man's Wisdom it's got a man anointing on it and then John is very different in the beginning was the word it's an eternal word it goes from eternity to Eternity why that's a that's a prophetic Eagle anointing upon the Book of John it's very different why because now but that is only protecting how does it protect you take Matthew 28:19 that is put in there to protect the way to the there's there's word there's things that are scripture being put in the word to protect the way of the Tree of Life remember Jesus said in vain do you worship me teaching the Commandments and doctrines of men so if you teach the Commandments and doctrines of God then you'll receive what God has for you amen so Matthew 28:19 is put there and that is actually a gospel God because people just read it say well I need to get baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost and they get baptized in titles amen those sincere I'm not questioning anyone's sincerity but they but they get baptized wrong but Jesus said enter you in at the Straight Gate St r a i t that's water straight like cook straight spelled the same way enter in at the water a gate there's only one gate to be baptized to be immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the gate amen so if you try and go in at the wrong gate you're not going to be allowed in you're like banging at a at a wall TR well this is the way there's one door am that's why Peter said no Paul said one Lord One Faith one baptism amen so that that is a gospel God hallelujah amen and then even the prophet tells us you don't even need a revelation on the water B you just need to read the scripture and it it'll interpret itself but yet it's those who will humble themselves to the word and will yield themselves then God gives them access am hallelujah amen and there's so there the way has been protected so the way I'll say into the feast has been protected amen the way into the feast is being protected and so the way of the tree of life has always been kept now this is from the sermon the end time in 54 he says now let's all go way back to Adam and Eve cuz when they came out of the garden she bore two sons that we know first Cain then Abel two boys now these boys after seeing that they had made Mortal and was going to die they tried to find favor with God they both come making a sacrifice I'll review a certain thing here I said last night if God only required religion if that's all he required then Cain was justified pardon me Cain came just as believing just the same as Abel did Cain was a Believer amen Cain came with a sacrifice just the same as Abel came with a sacrifice but Cain's sacrifice was by works he raised his garden brought his fruits the best he could find by works but Abel was justified by faith he came with a lamb what you'll see where uh fanaticism began you'll see where every one of these Cults begin you'll see where all this confusion begin and by God's help May the Holy Ghost place it in every heart here this afternoon I say this morning so deeply they'll never come out now then Cain came and knelt down built an altar I'd imagine they'd come to the east side of the gate for there's where the angel stood with it flaming sword guarding the Tree of Life by the way he was guarding the people away from the Tree of Life B says now he trying to drive people back to the Tree of Life Jesus was our tree of life so now back then he was actually guarding the way to stop people coming but now that cherub's guarding the way is actually trying to drive men and women boys and girls into the Tree of Life amen and I trust if God has become real to you you can actually come to realization I was driven something something in spite of me drove me motivated me Amen to partake of the tree of life thank you Lord hallelujah amen that You' have been given access to this Feast Hallelujah and so now the way the way is being kept now you may say it's not fair why is the way kept some people granted some others that's God choosing but to me it's whosoever will let him come if you want to will if if if you will to come then come you know let's go a um let's go A Song of Solomon one more time I just want to read the scripture yes chapter 5 verse two now this is the bridegroom speaking this is the bridegroom speaking I sleep but my heart waketh is the voice of my beloved that knocketh sorry I say this her thing but there now this is him saying saying open to me my sister my love my Dove my undefiled for my head is filled with Jew and my locks with the drops of the night so what do God declaring in this little remember this is inspired he's saying open to me my sister my love my Dove my undefiled hallelujah amen because many people say well I don't feel worthy to come you looking at you you look at the wrong thing many people think I've got to fix my life and then God can deal with me no let God deal with you then he'll fix your life amen amen but he's but he's looking at you saying you're undefiled if you can receive iten amen amen my undefiled my love my Dove my undefiled remember he that has been called who's been called you've been Justified who's been Justified and he that's been called has also been glorified amen amen that's what the scripture says about you I'm lost and undone no if he's called you he's been you've been Justified what is Justified he stood up he said find the evidence prove that she's defiled and she's she's worthy of death prove it amen what did Salon would have done after Jericho's Fallen amen Rahab they get married if anyone objects to this marriage please say something now maybe someone would have but she's a harlot she's a gentile she's a harlot she has no right to marry you he could have stood up and said remember he was a general he was in charge of the operation under Joshua he could have stood up and said prove it find the men find the men that did the ACT find them he took care of the evidence amen that there was nothing stopping her marrying him Hallelujah he took care of the evidence now if if Salomon could do that for a you know a man natural man could do it for a natural woman how much more a supernatural God Amen for his bride amen hallelujah hallelujah amen you got to look at what God you've been granted a great privilege in this day if you haven't recognized it God has given us a seven course meal he's laid out a banqueting house and he's bitten you he's been waiting for you to come to this banqueting house to partake of him he knows this world is in a in a in a famine he cused the famine that's right he allowed the famine to come but he's called you to come he's bitten you you look at things and take things for granted that the prophets of old were looking when is this going to happen you know Paul would have been under expectation when he wrote first Thessalonians chapter 4 they which are alive and remain should not prevent them which are asleep but th rise first then you'll go with them to meet the Lord in the air he would have been under expectation because the inspiration was fresh to him amen but he didn't know when it was going to be he was under expectation Timothy would have been under expectation amen at the end of his life it's been a Brethren it's been 40 odd years since Paul wrote this to us where where're the generation amen amen amen but they didn't know what was going on and yet now here comes a messenger in our day remember when I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see it doesn't say all it says for the first three is I heard that say come and see when I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see amen so there's an emphasis on the voice yeah and so you can sit here or you can just push play stream someone teaching or you can just see it and you can see the whole word program of God come together and you look at things that other even Luther had no idea what you looking at Wesley had no idea the early Pentecostal church had no idea the early church had no idea amen that's right amen and you can just sit there and you can just feed off of it and you can you can not only hear the son of man being revealed but that same one now comes into your life you come under the anointing that was on the prophet comes upon you Hallelujah and that's causing you to partake amen of the spiritual Feast am cuz if you're not Anointed with the same Spirit how can you feed off that Living God amen amen how do I know I've been how do I know I've been given access because the same God you hear him speak about lives today and is not in someone else's life it's in your life Hallelujah that's how you know cuz he's a living God Amen amen amen and people give their lives and they study the Bible and they don't have the key and they don't understand how it goes together and they're sincere people they do people have given their lives unreservedly given themselves even more than we probably give ourselves to the word and they didn't have the key they don't have the key and they look and they try and put things together and they spend their mental energy trying to put it together they don't have the key and they don't understand and then you're just walking along living your old life thinking what oh this is my plan for the future and then God intersects that plan and says stop walking in this famine I'm going to I'm going to banqueting house it must be full hallelujah hallelujah and you just sit there and say well now now I understand this and it's not I'm not talking about understand here move this down here whatever you do amen but something anchors in your heart now I see I see who God is you know even even brother Bisal at early age he was at the height of Pentecost and he didn't know if God was one two or three cuz he was under the anointing of that age before he met brother bar he had no idea and he was it was like a and he was preaching amen because they didn't know is he cuz some say he's two some say he's three some say he's one how does it work but then now remember the voice of the fourth Beast Hallelujah said come and see and then so now he came under the that same anointing we've come under am me you can see God for who he really is don't take it for granted you can see God changes his form all the way down through let us make man in our image well what was God he was a m he was fully all all God was he had a hidden Mystery in him a bride amen and then when Adam was created Spirit form there was even him that was a mystery amen that's not so scary is it let us make man in our own image well what was man he was a spirit man with a woman hidden in him and that was God's image amen and people trip over up all those things and then now that image was put in a body and then Eve came out of Adam and that is the full manifestation of the mystery that was in Adam and then here you are oh it's just a story and no it's not a story God is repeating his Plan of Redemption but the thing is because we know the author of the book am mean we know the one who's laid out the banqueting house and bid you to come in because we know the author it all comes together perfect amen hallelujah and then now Eve came out of Adam and then when Jesus was on the cross remember there was a bride in a bride had to be expressed and then so when he was on the cross what came out of him water blood and spirit amen the three Essential Elements for life Hallelujah so you and remember it says in Hebrews Paul is saying that Levi was in the loins of Abraham when Abraham paid ties to malisic he wasn't saying it figuratively he was saying Levi was literally in the man you work it out he was in him amen when when when he paid tithes and because he was in him hang TI was attributed to Levi hallelujah amen so now because you were in Christ amen when he went to Calvary it's attributed to you amen hallelujah that's not a figure it's a literal thing that's right all the father has given me will come amen where do we come from we came out of him Hallelujah that's why he calls what is a son or a daughter they came out of the father Amen in the in the bedding ground of mother and then they came out but that the life that was in that's why you look at your children you see you I trust you can see you amen and mannerisms or how they look you can see yourself in them because they came out of you amen hallelujah that's the same thing with God you came out of him that's why Jesus said I came from God I'm going back to God and you can say the same thing hallelujah hallelujah hey it is what it is you came out of him that's why we could say when he was on the cross I was on his mind but more than just mentally on his mind I came out of him hallelujah hallelujah what does the scripture say you know you he takes up a parable AA went to so the kingdom of God is like this AAU went to se sews out his wheat and then night time comes then another man comes out sews all the tears amen and then they both begin to grow then the question you you the workers say to the man who swed didn't you so good seed he said of course I did the enemy has done this amen and then so what happens is they say well should we pull out the wheed said no let it grow up to the Harvest and then when the Harvest has come then we'll gather the tears will be bound for the burning but the wheed is gathered to the Garner amen amen so the you know you you've seen the pictures the soul has got a big bag and he just throws it around amen it's the same thing remember the field Jesus interprets the the the um Parable you go read it he says the field is the world The Good Seed is the children you know children of God and the wheat is I mean the tears are the children of the wicked one he doesn't give any well I think it means this he says this is what it means so now the seed now if that's just natural but talking of in our families you say a so a soed what the life came out of the the SE and went into the ground and it brought forth the fruit amen amen hallelujah amen so so the seed that he swed in the field is a part of him that's why he won't lose one of his right the Seal of God standers for sure he knows them that are his amen amen that's what the scripture tells us so he knows what's part of him and what's not part of him amen because if it wasn't for election we would be walking on ice all the day oh I hope I make it I hope I don't make it I hope I please him I hope I don't please him you know is this but no God's election stands sure that if you're one of his you're one of his if you make a mistake he'll make you pay sure cuz you reap what you sow but he won't leave you just going on that trajectory that's right amen he'll cause you if you're walking towards a cliff of Darkness he's going to make sure you don't step off that Cliff amen hallelujah and maybe be very costly to you but he'll be dital I'm not going to let you go that way hallelujah hallelujah you have confidence in God Amen have confidence in the seed friends oh my family's going sideways what are you looking at right as I said a couple of weeks ago lot did everything wrong he was the one called with the promise God met me and said let's go here I'm with you this sounds really neat and then things get a bit hard lot just wants a better kind of life backslides ends up in Sodom Abraham didn't let him you know he didn't let him just go in terms of you know he would have prayed for his nephew amen he would have lifted them into God's PR and and he knew lot had daughters all those children we can't let them grow up in that kind of place amen remember if Abraham didn't intercede lot would have been he would have been ashes too amen and so now we've been granted amen you got to think about it we have a privilege don't don't take it for granted the voice of the fourth Beast they're flying eagle and then brother bam says when the seals remember it's an anointing on the churches down through the church ages so the first age was anointed with the lion anointing the word went forth in a mighty way I mean to conquer what the enemy was doing but then now when the enemy had control over the state then they started to state was able to actually persecute the church like never before so the church was anointed with an ox beast of burden and sacrifice anointing and they gave themselves but then around the time of Martin Luther the manage anointing came and they built the printing press and you see the reformers you know you take Martin Luther you know new languages he was a genius amen very very smart man and all the reformers were very smart men they knew multiple languages they translate the Bible did did incredible things but then the Pentecostal move was the last part of that man anointing the restoration of the gifts but then brother B says now when the seals are open then the eagle begins to fly that anointing and then also I'm just going to tie a few things together but then then also he's told in the early 60s store up the food who's ever heard of him he had a vision of bringing lots of food fresh veggies and things and storing it into the Tabernacle so there was a call God was telling him store up the food because there's going to be a famine thank you Lord amen so he says now we know so so be so I begin to store up see if I can find it doesn't taking sides with Jesus but then he does he does mention it earlier as well he he says I'll take a week no wait okay he is a around here anywhere that will compare with the message we have now of course our little brothers here that's out along here these other little churches are us we're ones who's saying the message that we have where would you go to to find it show its comparison anywhere you go right out in denominational Creeds you'll go right out away from the name of the Lord Jesus you'll go right away from these other things see and here's where the food's been stored up while one message I preached here to you all look I've been preaching from 1 to 6 hours to you on a message well if I had to use one of those message I'd take a week to take it and just a little bit here and a little bit there see because it's been stored up here it's on tapes it'll go worldwide on the tapes where people in their houses then tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinated of God he can direct his word he'll Direct everything just exactly to its course that's the reason he sent me back to do the store up the food here he said he forbid me to go overseas so he had the vision store up the food and we got tapes he got tapes and tapes of spiritual food amen I TR you know I trust this mean something to you what why is God doing that because God knows a famine because remember God said I caused the famine Amos say so he knew a famine was going to come so he had to make a storehouse now as I said the famine is not for bread or water or I could say even printed the printed word but the famine is hearing the word of the Lord amen that is the famine in the land amen so now God is instructing his Prophet now store up the food because he knows a famine is coming Hallelujah so God has provided a storehouse remember in a time of famine people will eat anything they bark off trees they'll even eat their pets they'll eat anything and so the world if someone's hungry enough they'll eat out of a garbage can just to try and sustain themselves and people if you look at the Modern Church of this day I wish I had it on me but there was one big mega church in in America and they and they put out a poll asking the people you know how it was and they said the older ones they felt they are not getting fed enough the older people in the church why because the meal is is it's not enough to actually grow someone amen so now he knows so God tells him to do this and then at the end of his ministry this is in 1965 yeah spiritual food and due season he preach sermon spiritual food and due season and then he goes he goes to the text in first uh First Kings 17 and you know you you how Elijah he goes to King Ahab it says rain or Jew will not fall until I call for it and then God says leave there and go to the brook cherith and I'll send Ravens to feed you yeah and then after that he goes to the widow woman's house so God God tells us Prophet now leave Israel and that's one sign a placees under judgment when a prophet leaves amen and so he says leave there I have a chosen place to feed you in time of a famine yeah so now the prophet was Fe was actually he was living just fine by that Brook cuz God had provided it for him so that he wouldn't perish with the rest of Israel during the famine so after the message came now then the prophets called go here and it's the same thing now we have a storehouse amen amen we have a brook Cher amen amen we have we have food that is prepared for us in this time of famine amen amen that you have been granted you have been allowed to come to his banqueting house that has been prepared for you amen amen does this mean I trust it means something to you Hallelujah and then so now I'm just going to so if we have this now he says in spiritual food a due season remember that's why that's why if you look at the world I'm not being judgmental but you just got to look at it why is why is Christianity Fallen you know why is it Fallen to where it's become accepted in many cases amen why is that it's because what they're feeding on remember because if you can't feed on if you don't have a real source of food you go to a garbage Camp amen and that's why remember it's meant to be the word that keeps the people amen it should be the attraction of the word should keep a people coming to church not not anything else but it should be the word that's preached and because people do not have the word anymore they have to substitute it for educational programs youth programs music becomes the main thing you know because there's no word there to keep them people they have to substitute it so instead of something that can feed the soul of a hungry person they have to substitute it for something else and that's what you see unfortunately why it's because we're living in a time of famine amen and it's because now the way to the tree of life is protected okay now remember it said the voice of the fourth Beast said come and see now when but it doesn't say that with any of the other cherubs cherubim faces it's the fourth one says when it heard the voice and so now God put a man upon the earth now this is very important because it's not him thinking this is what I think of the scripture amen but God put a prophet messenger upon the Earth because remember Jesus said the words I speak to they are spirit and they are life amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Amen how does God speak through prophets amen Amos 3:7 I'll do nothing till I reveal to our servants the prophets so when a prophet speaks and he's a Vindicated Prophet scripturally Vindicated Prophet then that is the voice of God speaking amen amen that is God speaking so that is I can say the voice of my beloved amen if you hear that voice but you hear not just not brother brandham but you hear that voice by behind the voice amen Jesus many people heard Jesus's voice but the disciples and like the woman at the well they heard a voice behind the voice then you then you this is more than a man speaking Peter said to him to whom shall I to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life amen amen they knew it was there was a voice speaking behind that voice that was God Amen and so it's the same thing now remember the way maybe I better of backtrack no I'll say this every age has an access to the tree of life every ages had an access yeah in previous ages denomination people could really be sealed into the kingdom amen but we're living in a different time we're living in a much different time wherever you because remember Jesus has to be on the outside of his church knocking yeah oh when's that going to happen it's already happened we have to realize we have been Bor into if you're young even you know we have been born into to an age where the judgments of God are already being poured out it's not the world is getting worse you know like it was fine now it's got bad but now it's just all bad amen we're not living in a time where it was good and then you can look back and say well everything you know hospitals never used to have big waiting lists like they have now things used to work a lot what's happened now everything's falling apart why it's because the judgments of God are being poured out but we just happen to be born into this time where it's pre-tribulation time I trust that's not a shock to you we're living in pre-tribulation time what is pre-tribulation time the tribulation starts to build things start to get worse and worse and worse amen and then the reason that is is because now as I said Jesus is on the outside of his church knocking so there has to be a time where he reveals himself and and they turn him down and and that's happened through the ministry of the Prophet amen that scripture was lived out in his life CU they weren't rejecting him they rejecting God just like when Israel wanted a king God said to Samuel they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me amen and so it's the same thing the churches didn't want the word to rule over them so they kicked him out yeah so he's on the outside so now the churches now canot bring someone to a complete birth y That's Right amen you need the access to the Tree of Life to actually be fully born again now this is not this is not being exclusive remember Jesus you know the lamb that was given before Jesus died on the cross that worked to cover sin up but then as soon as Jesus died that same lamb didn't work anymore God had changed his access to eternal life yeah and then so now that's why you see and I trust I trust you can see I trust you can see a difference you have who have been a nominal churches you can see a difference in your own life from being there to coming into here from actually receiving the message remember the message is Jesus Christ amen it's not a tack on to the Bible it's not some add-on it is he it is this being revealed amen amen so now there is no access there anymore to actually partake of the tree of life people can be justified they can even be Sanctified but to be fully birth into the kingdom is a totally different thing yeah so here was a man now I'm not saying he's the Cher but I I I trust this this this comes out right but anyone who rejects if you rejected John the Baptist you you reject his message yeah if you reject Moses you would have rejected Moses's message no one who rejected you know who would have got on the ark if they would have rejected Noah no one did they had to accept Noah to accept his message so they had to accept the vessel God was using in order to receive what God was trying to give yeah because the A and it's like the voice of the fourth Beast said come and see so now God would use a man to actually give access to to to the Tree of Life to Jesus Christ because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God Amen I trust it doesn't sound scary to you I trust you understand amen that so everyone who who's actually turned down the messenger do not receive what the access to the tree of life like they should have oh but I've been anointed I've done all kinds of things to be anointed and to be sealed in are two different things amen because it's like the you know it's like the parable I think we talking about this morning parable of Jesus said the kingdom of God is like a fisherman throwing a net out into the water pulls a net in what's that that's the that's the word going out all those fish come under the influence all the creatures in the net and and and I'll close with this all the creatures in the net come under the influence of the net so the fish the water spider the snake the eel whatever they all come under so you can say they all get anointed and now they're being pulled into the boat but not all of those creatures in the net are the fish amen then what happens the fish that are that that that the fisherman wants they go into the chili whatever you call it amen the others are just thrown oversight yeah so they all come under because in order to be convicted there has to be something prick your heart amen so there's an anointing goes out and that can actually con convict someone amen they can come under the influence of the word but then it actually takes now God actually actually they have to be willing to fully surrender to it amen and then God could they're fish they always were fish remember you always were seed you didn't become a son you always were a son amen oh I'm you know you may be battling through the greatest battle you've ever gone through but I trust there's something in you says that I'm a son or I'm a daughter amen amen you don't throw your kids away because you have a bad day with them I trust you don't anyway amen even if you probably maybe feel like it but deep down you know that they're yours amen multiply that by 10 billion billion billion ions and that's how God feels about you amen but we've been granted access I don't want to be too long today but we've been granted access to actually partake you think what you have I I I trust God just takes all this and puts it out how it should have gone thank you Lord but you have been given access and many people look at the same thing you look at and say it's ult it's fanaticism it's garbage yeah why he's so judgmentally he's mean look at what he does Amen but to the predestinated you know John you know John the Baptist ministry people would have said the same thing about him look he went up there before Herod and you know said you know it's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife and all these things so judgmental didn't even dress right didn't even have a church to preach him called them a bunch of Snakes in the Grass they so mean why is that he's so so mean but them it says in the scripture them that Reed John receed Jesus am we have some musicians amen but then so when you look at the word I trust when you look at the message when you hear it it's more it's more than words it's more than Supernatural Ministry amen but it's actually that's that's God speaking to you amen yeah and what and and if you can recognize that and not only just recognize it but then yield yourself can be hard to die nothing wants to die but when you finally do when you finally drop the mask and be real remember Jesus sees you as undefiled but you have to be willing to yield yourself to him amen just be real be real then God can come and take you and make you what he wants you to be if you're willing to let him amen we have a feast in this day the whole world is starving what does that mean we should hog it to ourselves now if you try a real good restaurant you go tell other people don't you you say that was awesome you you you must try that you take that to spiritual things this is awesome this is so amazing I've never been the same this the best I've ever had and it just keeps getting better amen it's a living God Amen oh I don't know how to witness tell how your candle got lit amen tell tell people he's real and then they'll listen to you that's what I think anyway amen let's sing um well uh uh Stephanie asked us to sing uh you chose me I mean let's just stand and sing this we have a banqueting house I don't know if this is how you expected today to be but I trust when you go out these doors you'll think about the message you'll think about your walk with God a lot different and say thank you Lord I'm not dying in some
