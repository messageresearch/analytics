your seat we got a couple of specials today and a bit of a a Sunday school play which I love so do you want to do the play first amen so let's get the kids up to do the plane we'll just set them all

Christine do why he preached on Wednesday you know he um you know we don't know what tomorrow is gonna hold and we know we're gonna need that keeping power of God so I think it's preparing us to what we we have in store for us and what is ours in Christ so if you want to put on that slideshow the PowerPoint you need to know a few things cuz I didn't know these things I don't know if you knew them and I've come from America but I didn't know what Martin Byrd was so William Branham says he made there was a Martin Burt well sorry a Martin box he made a yeah I was like what on earth is a Martin box never even heard of that so I found out that a Martin box is actually a bird box and at the Martin Bird and that's what they look like so just for your knowledge and the second one is over here uh Hornet so they also call them Yellowjackets unfortunately I couldn't find any yellowjacket so we have orange jackets today they call them yellow jackets and you can see they're very big they're a lot bigger than the average wasp or the B so they are very deadly because I can you know bite you multiple times and and they're big so yeah so we can continue on with our story we've got Joshua in narration and I need someone to sorry compiling a book a sunday-school book and I need someone to take photos in a video for me see I've got a cameraman over here he's gonna do that okay photos and videos thank you Jesse Jesse okay so um yep we've got narration by Josh no no no do today I know I was gonna say Oh day I've got the James and no day and no deer mixed up today um yep so I hope it will be a blessing I'm pretty sure it will go ahead it is now I was moving my yard up there mowing my lads trying to get my yard mowed down around around I had to stop change clothes go in and pray for somebody come out well my yard was grown up before before I in the back before I could get the front my mud it would grow up and so I'm one day I was back in the back I was back in the back with my old mowing machine a mowing and mowing along trying a little power mower and I forgot that there was a nest of Hornets in the corner there and I rammed that mower into that and back and back there I had my shirt off no shirt on I hit that fence with that mowing machine having those said on in a moment's time I was covered all over with Hornets you know what they are a big nest of Hornets they could kill you great big fellows just buzzing just the buzzing oh I thought first it scared me then all of a sudden something begins to happen begin to quiet down then Hornets still buzzing around now this sounds like a child this sounds like a juvenile but God of heaven knows whether it's truth or not I view my stand then instead of trying to fight and beat and smack them Hornets there was some kind of godly love come up over me and I thought poor little fellows he just got a right to build a nest that's the way God made for you to protect yourself and I disturbed you and I'm sorry that I did it if I had it to do over again I wouldn't disturb you I didn't mean to do it but I said I'm the servant of the Lord and his sick children is here to be prayed for and I got to hurry and mow this yard now you little creatures of God and the name of the of Jesus Christ go back in your nest I'll not bother you and what was it it was at a place where I could have been stung to death and in the love of God with submitted heart the projecting of love came forth and Sovereign Grace taken taken over what could tell those Hornets speak and every and every one it took their circle and a fly and lined up like a military bunch of so so the soldiers and went right straight they to the nest what was it I couldn't speak to the Hornets I have no way of speaking to them how could I keep them from stinging me I was at the end but I had love God gave love for those Hornets and I spoke to them in my voice and the Holy Spirit through Sovereign Grace guided those Hornets right back into their nest all right Hornets Yellowjackets orange jackets come stand up here we'll take our bow well done and that's our prayer for the week that these guys would take that same love and take it to their school and to their family and their friends who they're with ok you ready guys let's take a bow god bless you everyone [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I was scared of those Yellowjackets or in seconds praise the Lord a bit of a testimony on that is some some other thing happened to me and Reuben when they were healing a hornet's nest and only one came out and sting Liam where it could have been so much different and it's very angry little things though so yeah I can I can definitely relate to that I mean brother beau you've got a special for us are you gonna play piano as well god bless you I

sometimes you disappoint the Holy Spirit because he's talking to you and you are not responding you know when you talk to someone and does not talk back to you so that becomes a problem but the song

you know I wish I was a bit bigger yeah yeah I feel twice as good you know a man praise the Lord just everyone's happy and well and rejoicing amen let's go to Ephesians chapter one I mean let's let's roll up our sleeves and get right into it shall we I mean we're here to win hallelujah we have the victory Haven so let's go to Ephesians 1 and verse 3 down to verse 6 and then we're going to then we're going to go to John chapter 1 so effecient 1 in verse 3 just a couple of verses here blessed be the god I say as you're turning just a really couple of announcements so this coming weekend we have brother Hannes from from South Africa coming to to minister here he is a pastor of country Tabernacle so it's the end quanah's old pastor so he's going to be here this coming weekend so we're in for a treat I'm so have a full you know Church lunch we'll put on a spread and we'll have a glorious time and also we have a band practice or at 1:30 as well tentatively to you know praise the Lord that's all that so as you've turned a officials 1 and 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will I mean let's just go to Romans actually chapter 8 and verse 23 and then we'll and then we'll go to John 1 I just want to you know it's amazing the power that's in the Word of God and if we could just you know and I I believe that you know we're living in the great climax of the ages and it's just incredible where where where the Apostle Paul just right there that's God telling us he's predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself we could just catch that this morning the power and the and the assurance of what God has purposed in our lives now we go to Romans 8 in 23 he says so he says and not and not only they speak of natures travailing waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and this is an hour where nature truly is travailing but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body so we have been predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself when we know that fullness of adoption as the body change so he's predetermined our destiny to take a body change I mean let's just go to John 1 as well and we're gonna read from verse just just a living down to verse 13 here so John 1 and 11 it says he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God I mean this bow hits prayer Lord Jesus we want to thank you for this moment Lord we can stand in your presence and give you praise Lord to give you glory Lord just to Lord just to think as your Lord before there was a molecule before there was anything Lord you determined that we would be predestinated unto the adoption of sons Lord will be placed in your kingdom Lord father Lord as as overcome as Lord father joint heirs with Christ and dear god I just pray father as we look into your scriptures this morning lord I pray you as the author would come and make it live in every heart Lord father we will so desire Lord you just touch our lives Lord you had move us Lord you had lift us higher Lord you take doubts and all condemnation away Lord the weaker just look into the law of Liberty and see Lord your blood is loosed us from every every chain of darkness Lord from our past from from from everything Lord there's power in your blood Lord and Lord then that's been sent it's been released I believe in its fullness in this hour that a people would take a body changed Lord and we just happen to be living in this hour Lord and you predestined us here Lord that we would we would be translated Lord from this world to the next world by your power of your of your Holy Spirit Lord so I pray dear God may you just Lord just just take all burdens away take all worry Lord away about where we will end up Lord just but just put such an assurance in our hearts O God and father may we just walk this walk with such a confidence knowing you're leading us Lord Jesus not our ability it's not us doing it Lord it's you doing it father so Lord may we babble just Lord walk out of these doors with such an assurance that we know in whom we have believed father may you grant it for your glory lord I just ask you to take the service under your divine control Lord for your glory we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning but I want to I just said you know if I could take a title I want to take him talk about how we are pre dissonant unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself now that's an incredible thought where where the Apostle Paul you know he came out of Judaism he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he knew what it was like to to have a religion that was just purely works and try and earn something with God and try and gain favor with God with with how much he prayed how much he read how he dressed the things he didn't do and would do and all those things as all man's ability but but when he met the Lord on the road to Damascus everything changed I mean with a god that he read about in the scripture he realized he met that God on the road to Damascus and he realized his name was Jesus I mean it was no longer you know everything that we know that the Jehovah of the Old Testament as Jesus Christ of the new Amen so he he realized that God that Moses met he met there on the road to Damascus and then he began to tell the church the liberty of what they now possessed under the blood of Jesus Christ where it was no longer them trying to obtain something but now Christ had obtained all things a me but now now he would be able to tell them and to convey to them now by the power of the Holy Ghost you can overcome all things and you're actually predestinated to overcome all things you know when we talk about adoption we've got to understand in this that adoption in the Bible is not you know it's not like we would yes thank you you know it's not like adoption that we would think about you know in in our kind of culture like I would go to like an orphanage or I'd go to China I'd go somewhere and I'd get a child from over there and I would by signing a bit of paper bring them into my family but they're not blood relation to me but but by that adoption law they can become part of my family that is not Bible adoption Bible adoption means the placing of a son I mean so they're so a child that's been born into the family now comes and is placed in the family that it has the same rights ain't meant as the fact as the father of the family I mean that their word as good as the father's word it's as if the father is speaking when the child is speaking I mean so it's now a placing of a child in the family that is Bible adoption so you know I just really want I just pray that God would just take all all you know we put so much pressure on ourselves I pray God would just take the pressure off not not in terms of now we watch the we'll just go by because that's unbelief to me but they be telling us that we can we're gonna win we're gonna dance on the streets of gold we're going to take it translation I mean we're going to take a body change God as God has determined our destiny hallelujah God has determined our outcome and if we can just look through his eyes it doesn't matter what we face in life what battle we go against what demon power comes against us we have the assurance said Lord you're going to take us through this trial we're not gonna die in this battle but we can overcome and come through hallelujah so this is really where I want to go I just pray God will just come and you know you just think about what God's done for us he's done incredible things you know it's amazing the first the first prophecy of the of the you know of the Messiah coming was actually given to Adam II Adam and Eve and the serpent if we just go to let's go to Genesis chapter 3 and let's read this here it's incredible how God's determined do you know nothing's going to stop him nothing can stop them if nothing can stop them nothing can stop you as long as you fight the battle according to the spur to God not according to your carnal flesh you'll win amen and even if you fall in a fight I mean God wants to teach you something in that defeat it's not heaven that falls and that gets back up you may have been flawed by a sucker punched by the devil get back up hey Louie he wants a team God wants to amen let's just read here Genesis 3 and 15 he says and I this is God this is God promising this is God actually speaking to the serpent I'll put enmity between thee and the woman that's being to the serpent and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel that's the first promise of the Messiah coming you know when Abraham Lincoln would would would go down to the south and America this is during the slave days and he would he would he would he would land in a boat in Louisiana and and he would see the slave auction going on and he saw families being separated people just being solders just like cattle something rose up within him and he said I'll hit this thing even if it takes my life and he is determined I'm gonna I'm gonna break those shackles of slavery and it did cost him his life he would he would be assassinated there he was sitting in a in a theater he's up in one of these because he's the president he's up and one of the gifts you know arias here and a man came in and shot him and you know brother bran would tell a story that that um that that there was a feels an old colored man standing in a museum and and he was looking at a dress and a head a bit of blood on it this man took off his hat he started crying you so moved by what he was seeing and brother Brahim saw me said sir why you you know why he's so moved by this and then brother Bray I'm sore knee and he saw that that was the address of a person that was sitting next to Abraham Lincoln that tried to you know that that they've got Abraham's Abraham Lincoln's blood on the dress where the woman was trying to stop the blood flowing and and and and and and the old man said you know this man's blood loosed us from slavery and he is so moved by it and then brother and thought you know if a man can be so moved by by by just a man's blood I mean that actually loosened on slavery how much more the blood of Jesus Christ how much more the blood of God I mean that's looseness not just from physical slavery any better and spiritual slavery I mean how much more that should move us our God you purchased our Redemption you purchased our salvation he purchased your salvation your many times you think well I'm not worthy he made you worthy and we must remember it's not you that he looks at he looks at the Lamb I mean and if the Lamb is accepted you are accepted you know I've done it many times but you look at the Old Testament just say I'm a I'm an Old Testament worshiper and I know I'm guilty I've done something and the and the sin nature I'm born with this caused me to do it but God had put in his word if you just bring a lamb without blemish you'll be accepted so now here I am and I've got my lamb I've examined it the best I can I think well it looks pretty good I bring him to the priest now the priest who's a trust he's Justin see a priest and he wants to worship God according to you know how how how gods were to sit and so now as soon as the worshiper you just you know how you get a burden when things happen just like everything's going fine then something happens and your take care of it just the burden comes on you so no doubt this priest you'd see the man walking with us land know that a burden would come upon him I've got to exercise my priests office but he's not looking at the man bringing the lamb he's looking at that lamb he's not worried about the man and what he he's not worried about that he's look at the sacrifice because that's God's ordained mythos that's God's approach I mean that's God's sacrifice so now here comes the here comes the priest the man just goes to one side the priest isn't interested in the man remember we put out we put so much pressure on us but it's not the worshiper that the pressures on it's the lamb that the pressures on so now the priest says carve that way he brings the lamb he examines them all overseas of is there any blemish anywhere and then Fozzie says no the slams perfect and he officer on behalf of the worshiper and because the lamb was examined and found perfect the worshiper is justified by bringing the lamb so it doesn't matter what condition the worshippers in it's the lamb that has to the testing the lamb has to go through the examination and once it's passed the examination then the blood is offered and that blood is attributed to that worshipper and it's exactly the same thing our lamb was found perfect Pilate would examine him says I find no fault in this man I mean all their accusations against him were false amen this word was proven to be perfect hardly the word was proven to be perfect and he was offered on our behalf hallelujah and then well how do you know he is accepted he rose out of the grave trial hallelujah based on a couple of prophecies he did it and then he and then and then he comes and marries their weeping at the tomb and then Yoshi's broken and down and what's happened to my lord and then she he just says to her Mary changes the whole life and sure you've risen but then he says don't touch me I haven't ascended yet so I've got to take my blood up holy oh and then he took it up it was accepted he came back down he has now touched me handle me Thomas fill the holes your filler see where the spear winner and touch machine touch me yeah hallelujah and then the Holy Ghost came down proving that the sacrifice was vindicated so it's not the pressure is not on you the pressures on him I've done so much oh oh I've done so much wrong now hold on the Bible would tell us in Revelation 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him speaking of the Beast whose names are not written in the in the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world so we've got many times people take that as a negative scripture but to me it's a very positive scripture because we're going to understand before the foundation of the world in God's mind he slew him he slew the Lamb in his mind so before there was a molecule before there was anything in existence in his mind he already made a way for you I mean because now he he thought of you he knew what your earthly journey wood wood wood wood would be he knew what you're facing you the enemy that he was about to create there would come against you he knew the age that you had living and before it ever became material he said well I've got to make away for them hallelujah for the devil was ever created God thought of you and God made a way I meant for you to overcome the devil how do you think about it before because God always provides something before he gives it to his children you got to do this he's already made away hallelujah I think we can just go dancing into eternity right now hallelujah why because now so so our names are written in the Lamb's Book of in the book of life of the Lamb I mean before the foundation of the world now you can understand if God ever wrote your name in heaven in the Lamb's Book of Life now not the book of life section but the Lamb's Book of Life if you ever put your name there nothing can take it away as brother James hit me a quite a while ago brother Ramsay had know all the rubbing compound in the world cannot take your name off the Lamb's Book of Life it's impossible amen so if God has written your name in heaven and he always keeps perfect records Amen you cannot be lost I mean you can't be thrown away at the end you have to be there hallelujah Amen so you know I think we should just rejoice in that he say but I'm going go I feel condemnation and all that yo the problem is the devil he's a very sneaky devil you know if you look at warfare a sniper is just one man but if you but but but if a sniper is set up and he's taking out your soldiers and you can't see him that's where the danger is but as soon as he's exposed then he's gone right and it's the same thing with the vid with the devil he's like a sniper he'll hide there and he'll push I think brother and posted it on Monday Tuesday I see it's like he pushes himself into your life that he tries to fuse himself with you that you cannot identify him in your life many people wrestle with they say I'm wrestling with the flesh actually they're wrestling with the devil right and you've got to recognize this not you because the devil comes along latched himself into your life and he causes you to fall on things and he says actually it's you falling but it's actually him dragging you down but as soon as the light of the word has shone upon him then you can take out that sniper I mean then you can overcome but you've got to recognize it's the devil I mean it's not you it's the devil amen so we are we are predestinated unto the adoption or the places of children by Jesus Christ to himself now you think about the power the power that God has released in this age it's amazing the Apostle Paul you know here is a man who where where he only knew God of history he only knew how you know God was and and it was all as I said it's all an outward way oh you are working but there was no and and what he believed there was no dominion over the devil but now he would say that we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus the book of Ephesians will actually say God has caused us to be seated there we're at remember it isn't us climbing up the ladder I mean to come and to become a joint heir with Christ as God actually saying I'm gonna lift you up there and that is your destiny to be seated at the right hand of God to be joint heirs with Christ that's actually where you're going to end up hallelujah so now what he is saying is that this is where but we have been pre-decide to to end up so if God has has said something that's going to happen now you just take you know as I read there in Genesis chapter 3 you know the seed of the woman is going to is going to bruise the head of the seed of the serpent you're the devil thought that all the way down why do you think Cain killed Abel because because the devil said no I'm going to stop this from happening now did it no this is so Cain killed Abel did that stop it happening no because Seth was raised up in place of Abel who who came slew and then he and then and then and then Judah couldn't have children there was all this yummy I mean even I mean your Sara was barren for 25 years trying to withstand that you know the devil trying to fight that promise but then she believed in God she she judged him faithful and she received strength to have the baby and then even Rebecca was many years barren but then God came upon the scene and she had a child and was the devil all the way down through trying to stop the seed of the woman coming I mean and then now when finally they were in Egypt and and God's Word of of you know how that be in Egypt for hundred years a strange land they'll be afflicted but then God will bring them out with a mighty hand amen and the devil knew that the time was drawing closer he inspired Pharaoh to throw all the male babies into the river and be fed to the crocodiles did that stop poseurs I mean God would orchestrate it that that the devlins I mean Pharaoh himself would actually shelter Moses feed him nourish him train him look after him in his own house Amen said the serpent bruza Holly was actually raised in the house of the one who's going to destroy holy it's the same thing with us you know we have the civilization God you know you know it features that closest is medicine there's all these great things I mean but actually we are here we are raised up in this age to tear satan's kingdom down now I'm not talking about physically overthrowing countries but actually dethroning Satan out of people's lives hallelujah Amen says cry Moses was a serpent bruiser I mean he walked into Pharaoh's Palace just an eighty old man he said let my people go God was speaking through a man hallelujah and then he and he's basically proving to Pharaoh Pharaoh we know he was the Cobra he was the king he was the God of the Egyptians yo but but a symbol was a Cobra so now here was the rod of deliverance that Moses was carrying and his isn't he saying devil I'll show you something threw down the rod it turned into a serpent then he picked it up by the tail again it became a rod and he was demonstrating to the devil devil I can loose you I can bind you I have the power to loose you I have the power to bind you and we've got to recognize by the blood of Jesus Christ that powers in the church today and then we can bind the devil we can loose the devil Pilate by the name of Jesus Christ you have we have the power to do it I mean God actually wants his children his children as I ever came I want to see you overcome and I'm going to give you the ability to overcome but it won't be you fighting the ballots me and you fighting the battle you have the pay sale but I'm not worthy to use it but Jesus died amen for you to have it holy it's not about our worthiness it's his worthiness I remember he is our righteousness and started where it's not our own righteousness he is our righteousness I mentor so if he is our righteousness and we are as righteous as God is righteous I remember the problem is we we we expect we have to have some kind of perfect walk in order to finally conquer the devil but remember it's not it's not those who have a perfect walk amen remember remember the devil puts this perfection in front of if you just come to this point if you come to this time in your and you'll walk will you never have a bad thought you never have a bad day you never have a bad week never a bad month then you can actually use the spoken word but it's never that way remember because it's not those who are perfect mature perfection I'm talking about that can use that parrots those that are under the blood I meant look at look at brother Browns own life you know he he spoke Scrolls into existence spoke storms out of existence spoke the tumor the size of a grapefruit out of existence out of his wife's wife's I'm side you know salvation was given by the power of the spoken word and credible things happen but yet he got discouraged he wanted to become you know just just be hunted cuz people rejected him he had his ups and downs right but that power of the spoken word was placed in the prophets mouth and that same powers placed in you while using the Prophet is example because he has ups and downs but yet God gave him the Paris is if you're sincere nothing will stand before your prayers not even cancer amen and we have to recognize there's no weak parts of the body of Christ I mean there's no weak parts that's all strong it's all the same strength or the same body amen so so my faith is as strong as your faith right we may have different officers but our faith is the same you know the same faith that will take me in the rapture will take you on the rapture the same revelation that will take me in the rapture that will bring the dead Saints out of the grave amen will actually be the same revelation you have amen oh but one day I'll get there no no we're here if Google Maps was saying it's that you have arrived your destination is right here right you say well I don't know if I have it God died that you'd receive it amen so you know the scripture is very clear Amos three and three would say how can two walk to your except they be agreed see you just got to agree with his word how do you how do you even receive eternal life you've got to accept his word Amen it's more than just accepting a God of history you would accept his word today you know it's it's win this Bible you see people who are predestined to eternal life doesn't we're there they accept this is God's Word they don't think it's man's interpretation they don't think well it's most translations or pulls ideas or Peters ideas they accept the whole thing as being God's Word and then when God comes across their past and shines light on its word they say all my Lord Jesus changed me to match your word right because there's something built within the seat of God to say this is God's Word amen hallelujah amen now we'll go here this is just me believers take God at His Word remember remember at templates gonna fulfill it he's gonna fulfill it you're not going to fulfill it he's gonna fulfill it I mean believers love him more than anything else believers hold fast to every promise abraham held on for 25 years but every day he got stronger why cuz physically is more impossible Holly how's this going to work out I don't know he's gonna do it he's the god of the impossible I mean if he could stand there and say let there be Sun Moon and stars in their Sun Moon and stars can t look after you in your situation I mean if he if he if he already provided a way for you to overcome that thing in your life I mean don't you think it's going to happen his word will not return unto Him void I mean so when he thought of you as being overcome by men that's not going to return to avoid empty it's gonna manifest exactly what he said it to do I mean too often we look at you know our five senses really dictate our victory we should never let our five senses dictate our victory we should just let his word has promised to us dictate our victory or not hallelujah that's what we should do we should take God at His Word irrespective of circumstance whatever it may be no I'm going to take God's Word say I'm not well we're actually the Bible says by His stripes I was healed I am healed he's the Lord God that heals all my diseases well when did that happen it happened before the foundation of the world that was done and there was manifested on the earth 2,000 years ago that's already been taken care of hallelujah believers have a sincere desire to please the Lord everything they want to do and they can put a pressure on us because we want to walk in a way that pleases God but God put that in us amen ever since it is O Lord I want to walk with you you know he did that believers know and believe that they walk with the Lord as a love affair that that love whom has word more than anything else I mean they have decided to follow Jesus no matter the cost the pain of their approach this is not and will not exempt them from temptation mind battles and trials their biggest main battle that they wrestle with is are they one of them because the devil is constantly disputing with them that they don't have the Holy Ghost and they're not one of the Lord's and they do not have the victory I pin this down a month ago isn't it right that's what he fights you with who you are in Christ do you really have it uh am I just talking to me okay you know this but there's the thing because we were sincere desire Lord I want to walk with you not that I would obtain anything but because you're so worthy you're so wonderful you hang on Calvary's tree willingly for me I mean you were marred more than any man you took my sin yes not just the physical mention you know it's more than just the physical beating and the scourging but imagine you know you remember the day when you felt that sin burden on your shoulders for you just you imagine the send burden for the whole world upon your shoulders and he went up Calvary carrying that as a man but there was a joy set before him that was you redeemed what I thought of you before the foundation of the world I'm making it weight is going to be manifested upon the earth I'm in the internet that keri hilson you don't have to live with your Sundays you don't that live with the devil no more amen but God's already paved the way amen to get rid of him hallelujah what great love the father has poured out upon us hallelujah isn't he worthy and that's why the believers like Lord you did all things the the scripture would tell us when we were his enemies he loved us well lujah but the devil comes along and says no you're not one of them you know the devil is always based on performance look at the world two religions you take the main religions of the world okay Catholicism Orthodox Christianity you take Islam you take blood some you take all those things it's all about what you do trying to evolve yourself into a spiritual realm and it's anything the charismatic grandmas well be taught how to become a prophet trying to evolve yourself into something your own ability does it that's the devil's way because it's man trying to get himself somewhere but but the the scripture tells us it's not him that will earth or him that runneth but God that shows mercy amen so it's not us trying to evolve ourselves or something it's God reaching down and lifting us up to where we're meant to be it's him reaching down hearing when he reached down his hand for me when he reached down his hand real I was lost and undone without God or somebody reach down his hand and brother Harold Hildebrandt's hit and I agree he reached way down for me I remember the arm of the Lord is not short I mean it can reach any place I can doesn't matter how deep someone else you can be so deep into spear you can't see the light at the end at the top but he can reach down past there to pick you up out of it hallelujah hallelujah so I think we should just be happy amen see the devil always tries to make us doubt what the Lord has done for us because when we hear another one's testimony he whispers to us that kind of experience didn't happen to you your experience wasn't big enough so how do you really know you met the Lord right but we must have confidence in the Lord that all our testimonies are unique to us remember God is not a cookie cutter that's not to say a sinner's prayer and walk God now you there no no God has to meet you and he'll meet you according to his word but your testimony will be different to mine mine will be different to yours but it's God drawing his children to himself to the word amen so we must understand that our testimonies are unique to us and then Lord knew what he had to do to turn our hearts to him and that his work will be will be perfect on the day of Jesus Christ now you've got to look at what is what is really the greatest miracle we can see upon the earth seeing the dead raised would be amazing I've seen storms gone I've seen tropical you know downpours go I've seen set I've seen devils cast out I've seen people healed I've seen all kinds of things but what is the greatest thing to see the greatest thing to see is a someone's heart turn to believe the full word of God that is the biggest miracle where where someone's heart was an unbelief then God comes upon that soul and now they believe that this is the word of God and it's entirely Amen as we know that the ministry the Ministry of Elijah was to turn the hearts of the people back to God now as he stood there on Mount Carmel and everything was according to the vision of the Lord he he rebuilt the altar of the Lord he had the sacrifice there the water was poured out upon it he would prance and Lord they the people know that thou art God and thou has turned their hearts back again this is in first Kings and in the fire fell as a vindication I mean that God was actually doing this the fire fell that was the proof that Elijah's ministry was true hallelujah so now we understand that John the Baptist part of his ministry was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children so to turn the people as preaching literally turn the hearts of the people from the from the Old Testament law to receive the Messiah that was that was his ministry now we're going to ask the question how do we know that his ministry was true and how do we know he pointed out the true Messiah well I'll say it very simply because the fire fell on Pentecost the fire fell on the sacrifice it was 120 sacrifice in the Upper Room and the fire fell upon them consumed them and they walked out with that living fire in their lives that was a vindication that looked at that John the Baptist was the true prophet of Elijah with the spirit of Elijah and we can see the same thing today how do we know we've received an elijah ministry today because the fire is fallen and because the fire fell hallelujah because the fire is fell upon people the Holy Ghost God is now tabernacled and man once again I mean and what's the vindication of that we can actually take this as the Word of God I mean what was the message actually intended do take the people from the creeds and dogmas I mean back to the pure Word of God the Bible I mean and what is the message to vindicate this is the Word of God right that's why we don't have another book this is the book the whole message is in here see he says like the seals us all through the Bible I mean that you know all that they says you got from Genesis to Revelation you should be able to see any doctrine you should be I'll take it all the way through I mean so it's a vindication that the Bible is the Word of God you know it is see when people say well Paul it was just Paul's opinion they it's actually man's reasoning silver as opposed to know what he wrote is actually God's Word you see but but the Ministry of Elijah was seen to turn the hearts of the people that we actually can receive the whole Word of God because what is actually the evidence of the Holy Ghost you can receive the word right because of felt because of the Spirit that wrote the book as in you you can't deny the word that's impossible but if the Spirit of the Bible's in you and you say Amen even if I cut you deep and it does a whole bunch of yeah you're gonna use it all boy you really get burned out but it does you good at the end you know but you'll be waiting say Lord chop that pride out chop that pity party chop that complex chop that in different spirits whatever it may be I've been carrying for years that lost spirit and you know I think I'm wrestling against the flesh grunts the devil you know chop it all out of me and you will be changed hallelujah Amen why because you can take God at His Word that's the problem o people wrestle now this is not this is not Baptist theology of just saying you believe it and you have it by faith and there's no evidence of it there's actually a vendor you know your life has changed when you can receive this as the Word of God then your life changes to match the scripture but it's him doing it in us amen it's not it's not us trying to conform to something many people have tried but they bid Lee failed I mean but there's a people upon the earth and actually take God at His Word and then God pours a spirit unto them causing them to live the word as the Apostle Paul would say it's no longer I that liveth but Christ liveth in me amen and we should be able to say that have the same testimony it's no longer either liveth I mean being blind died awhile 2007 that guy died September 2007 the old one and and and there's a side on him do not resuscitate right do not resuscitate that guy but now than you guys here hallelujah why cuz I died to myself and was born again by the Spirit of God because I took God at His Word yes incredible you know when you you know when when a doctor will prescribe the right medicine if you don't take it you'll you'll get sicker but if you take the doctor at his word and you believe what he's saying your faith in the medicine then you get well and then and then he can maybe have a whole bunch of time your case studies look this person took it with your same symptoms they got well this person same ages you same blood work whatever they got well that's why I'm recommending this I mean and then we could just look into the scripture and say well what happened to the people that took the same prescription amen look at the Apostles they had a Bible faith that a Bible doctrine of Bible holy ghost said took him to a Bible heaven I took them to heaven right hallelujah I mean all the believers down through the ages I mean they received the Holy Ghost that took them up in the glory so now if dr. Peters prescription worked for the Apostles and for the dim in the book of Acts amen I think we should take the same prescription right because we got case studies now we've got we've got evidence here that these people receive the Spirit of God in their lives and they overcame all the pressures of the age well what is the prescription repent and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children those that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call and they took the prescription lorry and we're gonna shake their hands and embrace them and dance around and we're never glorious time and eternity why because they took the prescription and if it and if it worked for them it'll work for me because the medicine hasn't changed the manufacturing quality is still the same right but it's passed all the QC analysis all those things that have been proven it's still good so why don't we take it I think we should take it hallelujah amen so now brother Aaron would say in this is in God's approach to fellowship God's provided approach rather he maintained speaking of jobs he maintained a fellowship and the hours of trial and so much that he cried he said I know my Redeemer liveth when he was suffering and even his wife said job why don't you just curse God and die job was under the blood he had offered the burnt sacrifice which he knowed he was righteous because that's what God required he came under the blood and had divine fellowship with God even in the last hours of his great temptation he cried though he slay me he had all trust them amen that's what the church needs today is their bedside well so church needs a as a no so fellowship under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean even death can't even darken it out he says I've stood by the bedside watched them die with a cold handshake I've seen them stand there and die shouting the praise of God knowing because it had fellowship they knowed where they were standing oh if I could just go through the experiences of knowing thank you hallelujah I'm looked after I like it I how I could go through experiences of knowing of experiences I've seen with people how they don't see they don't never try to don't ever try to get to God any other way than under the fellowship to fellowship with God but under the blood that's the only way God knows the only way that as God will recognize them but many people try and get to God by reasoning it's not reasonable to do those things because the church doesn't teach it no more or by just to or by just agreeing with a church but you have to get under the blood that's how you get in fellowship you got to get under the blood now but the only way to get truly under the blood is to receive the Word of God remember as Jesus would tell thee he would rebuke the scribes and Pharisees but he says by teaching the commandments and doctrines of men you may the Word of God no effect to the people if you look at the Old Testament law what was the effect that was meant to have they were dwelling in the land in peace every man under his fig tree and have his olive orchard and all those things that was actually the power those contained in the law one will chase a thousand to chase ten thousand that was the promise they had but by the time the Messiah came they had long forgotten those things I mean at least Gideon in the time of Judges had that kind of remembrance when the angel Lord came to him he says but but if God be with us were the miracles where is the God that Moses had where is the God that even Joshua had where has he gone we're still Jews were circumcised we're believers but where is that God gone see he had enough spiritual remembrance to say well if God's really with us these things should be happening right but then by the time Jesus came a man they weren't even thinking of that way they were just trying to keep their political stand in the nation and you know trying to work things out by their own reasoning but they had long forgotten the power contained even just the blood of a natural em by by taking God at His Word see but you go so he said though by teaching the commands and options and mean you make the Word of God no effect so if we want the word to have effect in our lives if we want the blood to have effect in our lives who were to take God at His Word now Jesus would would say in John and I'm just going to turn to this because my handwriting is quite scary John 5 and 46 if you want to turn with me to that we'll just go here real quick sorry John 5 and 24 the Lord's here to take away all fear we don't need to worry we don't need to worry God has it all in control he says John 5:24 the words of Jesus saying verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life now that word condemnation actually means the judgment see that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me right hath everlasting life now not not in the future but you actually you hear the word and that hearing maxy means to understand you actually understand your your spiritualness things come open and you actually believe on him and send him so you're not just saying this man's a product from Galilee this is God in flesh and God send him upon the earth and the words he speaking is God's words right bill it he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life so it's in their position right now right it's already in their position that's not something they'll get one day but they already have it in their possession do you realize what you have what you're packing when you get up in the morning when you go to school when you go to work when you come to church what you have you said I've got everlasting life hallelujah listen what do you think I get excited this is exciting doesn't matter what happens in life well the devil tries to do what he whispers in my ear what he threatens me with I've got everlasting life and my god is present amen - to keep me to look after me to fight my battles to keep you on the way hallelujah now notice it doesn't say anything in that verse about the person's condition that hears and believes the woman in the well was in a certain condition see the problem is we put such pressure on ourselves I'm not worthy yeah I I'm not worthy to receive the promise I'm not ready to receive the open-book and to become one with the word and prophesy again and to stand on the devil's head and stomp a little bit and overcome I'm not worthy of those things it doesn't say nothing in this verse about the condition of the person the woman of the well heard the word of God and it was just her life being discerned she was she was married five times she was now with another man not even married this is how her life was a total you know this is just how it ended up but God said Jesus said I need to go by the way of Samaria because that was one of her seed one of his predestinate seed she was pre desert unto the adoption of sons right this is where God you should end up so God when he when she was in that condition that was not where she was going to finish hallelujah so now here she was she heard the Word of God she believed we know where Messiah cometh he'll tell us all things and Jesus just took her from not future promise now it's here Here I am he that speaks the am he amen and her whole life was changed what was she now packing when she ran into Samaria come see a man that told me everything I ever did is this not the very Messiah he did heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life amen you go all the way through the scripture God always takes the unlikely he takes the broken he takes the what man would call useless and God says no those are my ones because he knew what how they would respond to him Holly and then we wrestle with ourselves saying well I'm not worthy the woman who well didn't say anything about that the light struck her quicken the seed and he went off testifying and I believe she was in the upper room and I believe we'll see around the throne glory to God hallelujah amen so you know it's not our condition they shall not come into the condemnation that was still in John 5 and 24 they shall not come into the condemnation so they shall not come to the judgment they shall not go to the great white throne judgment remember this is what this verse saying this this verse is saying if you hear hear if you receive if you hear my word and believe on him that sent me you have everlasting life and if you have everlasting life and you come up to a junction remember Google Maps will take you because it's two paths we end up right we're either sent with Christ and judge the world Paul said the Saints will judge the earth where the sit with Christ and judgment judging the world are we're standing before the throne being judged best of two places right so now this scripture is telling me that if God quickens his word to me I believe on him he gives me everlasting life remember if you have everlasting life at look there's a difference in your life right there's not a Baptist thing as there are I believe and there's no change the one of the world's life changed Peters life changed Paul's life changed I mean legion's life changed or that their lives are all changed and Jesus would after heal people said go and sin no more lest a worse thing come upon you so he didn't say just continue as you work go and so no more don't do the things that cause you to end up here right so so so now there's two places we end up either being judged or judging right the Saints will judge the earth so now this scripture tells me if I believe the word believe would hear my word and believe on him that sent me I can't go to stand before the throne to be judged you following me I will end up actually sitting with Christ judging the world hallelujah why does that make you rejoice because that takes all fear away I don't need to worry because that's because there's always it you're the devil always hangs in front of you you're not going to make it you'll end up being lost at the end you're not going to get there doesn't he do that am I just talking okay that's just me now man you guys are awesome I you know but this the scripture takes all the pressure off because he will because remember we are predestined and to the adoption of sons right our destiny is predetermined I don't know why people don't believe in predestination I love it it depends what side of the ledger you're on but jesus said all that come to me all no wise cast out right so people say oh I don't think I'm being called I just come anyway Lord Here I am Lord Here I am you said you wouldn't turn me down Lord Here I am Oh God if he doesn't answer come back next day Lord Here I am change my heart Lord speak to me I mean take things out of my life this country to your words you can come dwell in me Lord Here I am Here I am keep seeking keep singing and he'll open hallelujah that's what I would do that's exactly what I'd do and I can just say I did it amen let's see here we have John five and forty-six he says for had ye believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me so they didn't actually take Moses writings as God's Word they just that they read it they started it but it was just Moses writings to them even though I mentally though I said yes the Word of God but actually in the hearts no I wasn't but the bride says yes that wasn't Moses writing there wasn't Paul writing that wasn't Peter writing that wasn't Malachi writing it wasn't John writing this was God taking man scribing his word down hallelujah to give it to us a weird read it at a heart of faith I mean and God will quicken that word to our lives and it would manifest earlier so we can't go the bride can't go to the judgment and be judged mimic Christ took our judgment on Calvary the wrath that we should have received was poured out on him I mean the judgment you should have received was poured out on him I mean he took out judgment he took the judgment of God remember remember a law without a penalty is not a law right and our God is a righteous judge remember he's he he he is full of grace he's full of truth he's a loving father and all those things measles are God of judgment right you can't have half of God you got to have the whole thing so now the penalty the penalty of US law is the day you either of the day you shall die son had to be judged right so God because he's a God of his word he had to cause the judgment to happen for the penalty to be met so he became a man hallelujah hallelujah you think I'm beside myself I know where I'm standing glory to God God became a man because remember what did he do in the garden just like Abraham Lincoln I'm gonna hit this thing it will cost me my life Polly knew it would halleluyah knew the penalty I made sure became a member nothing's gonna stop him the scene of the woman could not be stopped I mean and and and and and as he couldn't be stopped the bride can't be stopped neither policies even it's gonna cost my life I'm gonna hit this so I'm gonna hits it on the head pala I'm gonna release a power on the earth that said nature will be broken out of people that will believe and receive me hallelujah and he did it and he did it for me and he did it for you I try hallelujah glory be to Jesus amen hallelujah widow's speaks about being pre-decide to the adoption of sons that's the Lord's doing I'm not gonna leave them slaves to the devil I'm not gonna leave them slaves their first birth that's in nature they're born with I'm gonna undo it how long I'm gonna undo it although you mentioned mention that the first prophecy he's actually talking to his enemy he's not just talking to a demon if I'm gonna fix this piece out I'm gonna deal with you boy and he did you know we're here just enjoying the victory they say I'm in the heat of a battle no no don't worry about the battle just look up just look at the divine promise your take God at His Word beside I don't know how this is going to happen just take God at His Word he say it's impossible take God at His Word hallelujah the doctors give you up thank God at His Word I mean this you know whatever is giving you up just take down at his word that's all you've got to do well lujah he say it can't you it can't happen who said who said if God said it can happen I thank God it is worth if God promised me the Holy Ghost eight I thank God and His Word FECA oh give me a piece of passes all understanding all that God has worse if he said that I'll prepare a table for the other prisons of my enemies I'll take God at His Word tyloo if he's idiot anoint my head with oil my cup runneth over for joy I'll take God at His Word if he said there's a hiding place in the secret was Tabernacle he will he will hide me away I'll take God at His Word even though the enemy may breathe out as threatening so the enemy may surround us I'll take guard his work he will look after you hallelujah but I'm not worthy of being looked after no no no no you got to get that out of your mind remember when Jesus remember when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world you know we're gonna think for a second do you think God is surprised of your life's journey upon the earth the good and the bad he's not surprised we carry guilt of something in the past he knew you'd hate he knew you'd do those things he's not in panic stations you know you know what's gonna happen today and you know you know it's like you know sports games or like the election that's going to happen in this country it's going to happen next year in America they're already projecting who's gonna win I think this is going to happen and you know you know they always give this analysis I think I think I think based on different variables and things they know you know God's not like that God is not worrying well I wonder if you know he's not thinking I wonder if brother cabins going to make it that's not how we that's not how God runs his business but I've said it be safe now you can put all your names here I trust you just did amen but you know he doesn't he doesn't just run his business well save them one day off well I guess I couldn't have them that day you know that just went wrong I don't know how that happened no that's God saved you he saved you if he redeemed you he redeemed you right I meant if he already has hallelujah it's gonna happen right it's not a you know you know what I mean if God thought of you before the foundation of the world and he saw you made in His image victorious dancing on streets of gold me and my brother BAM said that God took a photo of us at our best and put it in his family album and that's not in your this body best that's in a glorified body best by the way right and he says now everyone in the family album is going to be expressed they're going to be dipped in blood and they're going to be made into this image right and he's not free thing and whirring how's it going to work out he knows exactly how it's going to work out remember he knows the end from the biggest you're the devil so stupid you know imagine fighting a bear Menten fighting a war and you know exactly what your enemy's gonna do it's not it's not guessing right remember people you know this nation has spies everywhere spies and where's when when war is on they try and break the codes and try and work out what do you think they're gonna do they're gonna move these troops here and do all this it's it's a lot of it it's an educated guess but it's still a guess but imagine if we fought a war and when you down to the picosecond which is why the shortest measurements of time what the enemy would do where he would be imagine that you know at 1251 he'll be here and one o'clock he'll be here and he wants to go here and here and here this was going to imagine having that kind of intelligence that's the that's what God has but then imagine being the enemy knowing that your enemy no there's another devil that devil knows God knows all things but somehow he thinks he can sneak one past God and win the day this is so dumb but the devil's deceived but that's the kind of fo we fight this this is the foe God faces he knows exactly what he's going to do and when he's gonna do it how he's gonna try and do it they are and God's not worrying well I wonder how this is gonna end up he knows exactly how it's gonna end up glory and if that's about him how about you he knew we would fallen soon he knows the temptations you fight he knows when the devil tries to warm himself into your life and think it's actually you you're fighting but it's the devil he knows the thoughts that go through your mind he knows the things we battle God knows everything oh should I be terrified of that no cuz I have a lamb the Lord provided a lamb hallelujah that we don't need to worry he doesn't he said well I'm not worthy no no it's the lamb that's worthy Allu young you know there's a woman in the in the scripture and I'll just I'll just close with this there was a little on the scripture had a bloody shoe she had it quite a long time but she knew she had to get to the master and she touched the hem of His garment she has made well a few chapters later to see if I can find this that wasn't Matthew 9 Matthew 14 let's see that many people touched him and were made perfectly whole it's a power of a testimony one woman did it something in the rest of people said well if that person got healed I can do the same thing and the same faith that she had because of her testimony the other people received the same faith and they did the same thing hallelujah there's a powerful testimony I mean you think about it we have we have we have a testimony God's healing power God's deliverance I mean God's keeping power God's saving grace hallelujah hey if the Philippian jailer can be there right and then Paul and Silas forgive a pre-meeting a shout and sing and praise God and God comes down and shakes the place do you know why they are thrown into prison because the jailer needed salvation many times we go through a trial we're going to understand this this more to the troll who meets the eye like I stalk about Daniel in the lion's den that lion's den was made to destroy Daniel's enemies but if we get so caught up in trouble oh well as me oh man unless you'll miss the whole picture but you've got to keep it in mind god you're doing something even if I'm going through the wringer God you're doing something and it's for my good olia so so there they were that beaten they had stripes they begin to praise and sing God I mean yo-yo singing give glory to God then the place shakes and the jailer comes and he's about to kill himself because that's how they got fired in those days being a jailer and you know he's about it but but then he hears a voice from the inner prison don't kill yourself for all here yes he heard their singing he heard their worship and he came and said what must I do to be saved believe on the Lord Jesus and thine and thy house shall be saved and the outcome was he got saved and his family got saved and if it worked for him it'll work for me hallelujah ever worked for them that his family got saved his house got saved it'll work for me and you've got to remember when Jesus went well it was Jesus as Peter was speaking through G Jesus was speaking through Peter repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you shall see the gift of the Holy Ghost and it's for you and for your children many of us afar off means the Lord our God shall call sometimes people go afar off people can be even sitting in church and be afar off right but we're going to take guard as word God who's received the Holy Ghost here y'all the hell are you havin I trust you have so if you've received it it's for your children as for those are afar off as varies a lot I got your call God call them get them Lord the same Holy Ghost is in my life is for them we need to take God at His Word often they going in the wrong direction the particle son went in the wrong direction he made up his mind he got frustrated how things are going and I well I'm young and I think I can do everything and I'm gonna you know I just want to see the world and get out of this prison and don't learn another God knew it would happen but those those parents are praying sure they had to let him go but that didn't that wasn't the end they begin to pray and hardship begin to happen think about him sometimes people's worlds fall apart and they meant to his life fell apart he thought he had it all he had the money back yet his inheritance off he was going he's living it up finally I'm free of old mum and all dead and all the restrictions of the farm and I'm doing all this and his will begin to fall apart and he felt why because parents were praying thank God at His Word when Jesus said only believe he didn't say only he didn't say believe and take out everything else into consideration he said only believe what does that mean you only take God at His Word you only you don't look at the circumstances you don't see what's going on what did those parents do honey we're believers in Jehovah God the scripture tells us in Isaiah that the word shall not depart out of the mouth of my seed or my seed seed henceforth forever a son must return home I'm not willing just for half the children save they're all going to be safe we're under a promise remember God made a covenant with you and what's that that's not you making your promises to God God's made his promise to you I mean we're going to recognize that God has made a covenant with you holy and he's going to stand and he's going to keep up as into the bargain remember he said to Abraham I'm going to make your father of Nations he made a covenant with Abraham and Abraham could not fail because God said you cannot fail because everything I am I'm investing in this promise you know God put everything behind his word and he'll bankrupt heaven before one word falls to the ground hallelujah so so they begin to pray or Jehovah God bring our son home bring our son home he's gone out of his inheritance he's left bring I don't know where is bring him home and all his money dwindles and all his money dwindles what's happening God is answering prayer and God is answering prayer and then his friends leave him and there's a famine in the land what's going on God's answering prayer and then finally he's in the Pigpen and the angel Lord comes into the Pigpen and that happen easy that that spread that came upon him in the house cause of resentment of whatever it was was lifted off him and he came to himself and he just began to look at it and say my father's servants are better than a bit awfulness I'm gonna return home what's happening prayer was being answered hallelujah and then finally in the house is a peace came one evening when the prayed honey did you feel that yes juniors coming and then the father started watching from the return we're gonna have the same kind of faith I have in the same car you know how God's in control of everything many times you think all what's going to happen in control we're gonna touch there's nothing that happens upon the earth that he doesn't know about nothing I mean does think how did this why did this happen God knew it would happen right but you've got to take God at His Word for yourself you can't sit back don't say oh woe is me you know Moses was crying unto God the Red Sea was closed up you know they were you know the Egyptians are here and got a Moses Christ under God and God's is some don't cry unto me speak and move forward don't cry out speak the Word of God move forward many times we sit in the wall as me pile sure we're going to do that sometimes and and now I'm not talking about holding grief and you're gonna let grief out right gonna live out but but there comes a point where we were to where to stop saying well as me but and we'll change it from actually taking God at His Word you understand I hope that came out the right way joy don't bottle things and let it out whatever you do you got to let it out right remember a bottle you know you put too much pressure into a gas canister poof you know we're called to lid off the pressure how do you let off a pressure take all your burdens to the Lord and leave them there sure you may go to cry until you can't cry no more that's fine just let it out right but then you've got a we can't just sit back and what was me you gotta speak the Word of God and move forward they could have wallowed in their sadness I must sell Johnny and he's gone so sad and when you think your return I think you ever eternal no they said no no honey we've got a promise God gave us a promise he's going to return and then so they're so the peace came that one time just dramatizing to make it more real but you know how it is and then you know finally I said you know did you feel that peace yes he's coming home then the father begin to watch because the scripture says when when when the prodigal son was making his way home and he was feeling so condemned about what he had what he just did and what is walking out of the father saw him afar way off what was that he was watching the same path he walked down now the father's watching from to walk back that same path hallelujah and then what happened now the father ran to him said son you know the sons I'm not worthy to be called your son no more just be your servant you know God is the other father was not interested in making his son a servant because of what he did and it's the same thing with God God don't want us to be servants the blood of Jesus Christ loves her from servanthood into sonship I meant it doesn't matter what we have done that's not God's intention to make us a servant and to hold it against us he doesn't care I mean he wants us to be restored back to where we should be and so the and so the son is living with this condemnation but the father just embrace him and tells to one of his servants get the best robe get the ring kill the fatted calf my son's home take offers take off his rags of us of his harlot tree and as you know a certain take it off him bribe him with righteousness put the ring put my ring on his finger put the signet ring on his finger a minute.what he seals as yes is the same as me saying yes hallelujah my son has returned home they took God and His Word remember Jesus in a certain man had two sons I believe he is pointing out a real thing that happened but the parents took God at His Word I'll leave it there but I'll say this if that worked for them in the full of Philippian jailer same faith faith of our fathers living still hallelujah same God help them will help us he say that was 2000 years ago same God that was there as here hallelujah we just got to take God at His Word yeah you say that don't work I've heard testimony after testimony overseas I'll just give you one here's a young man he wasn't serving God they had a they had a midweek service that temperates just a few years ago God came down in a powerful way and in the Sun so so his parents and his um and his siblings they went to church son wakes up at home no one's home midnight he begins to panic where are they he tries to call them they don't answer their phones he's shouting praising God God's moving in the church and he tries to call someone else they're not there and he drives her sir someone's and the churches home that's closer you know close they're not there so he drives to church this pajamas actually damages his truck on the way and he walks into church because he thinks he's missed the rapture mmm and before he had woken up his little sister came to the front and said I want my I want my brother saved and he comes in and his pajamas saying thank god they're here and he comes and gives us life and he's a believer amen you think God can't do those things he is the same yesterday today and forever you can go through the prayer lines of the Prophet every sickness that can be named cast out healed restored renewed any problem done that could have the same God back there as here he said but I'm not worthy you're looking at the wrong thing the lamb we have a lamb what a job say why could Jobs think believe he was righteous he wasn't believing in his own righteousness he had confidence in the lamb that he offered hallelujah and if job could stand I said I must I'm righteous clay took God his word I've offered the lamb how about a perfect lamb a perfect lamb hallow that makes a people now perfect sinless sinless perfection never let the devil think get you to think you're not worthy about my past condemns me his blood will take care of that you read it Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgressions I've done transgressions in my life he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes we were healed what did it what the Lord do I'm gonna take care of it all I'm gonna take care of everything that you don't have to worry about nothing am I gonna make it well I believe I'm gonna make because he said so he promised me he's coming back for me not based on what I've done what he has done remember the key of faith unlocks every door and what does that faith it's a finished work at Calvary it's already done hallelujah take on his word church we are producer and to the adoption of sons his who's gonna get you there he will he'll get you there just love him and walk with him that's all you got to do love and faith work together right you can't have faith in someone unless you really love them right if you really love the Lord then you have faith in him it doesn't matter what happens in life you say my world has fallen apart God knows and he's not punishing you he took your punishment on Calvary right sure he has maybe regard as a certain way but you know don't think God's angry at you remember he's not mad at you he he if he's predestinated you on to the adoption of sons he's gonna get you there it's a little the con dinner you said well I've done so much bad in my life but you have a lamb I feel so condemned about my past you have a lamb and God knew you'd do those things so just give it to him don't carry those things no more am I gonna make it I believe I will cause he said he what he said I will and when we gathered round the throne I probably said it Oh Lots brought that one more time when we get that round the throne I will know the reason I'm nearest cuz he wanted to be there he knew my heart would receive him when his word came across my path and he got me there I just say to my I say darling you say to my honey beer it's all the Lord our Walker's all the Lord our salvations on the Lord our rapture will be all the Lord it's all him we're not going to be gathered around Thrones and begin to have a testimony meeting and say I did this and either this night there's no Toby and he did this and he did this and the sickness he healed me of it and this thing I had for years he took it from me and I was lost and twisted in my mind he came and he delivered me at a knee he did this and he did
