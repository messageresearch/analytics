[5:43] with us tonight
[5:46] our gracious heavenly father
[5:49] lord we love you so much lord

[5:55] matter where we walk
[5:57] when times are getting a bit confusing
[6:00] father and
[6:02] a lot of things gone in our lives lord
[6:04] and we we feel like time slipping away
[6:06] even just to spend in your very presence
[6:08] lord
[6:09] and sometimes lord we we want to have
[6:12] more time with you and we find that the
[6:14] more we want to be with you the more
[6:16] we get hindered lord the more things
[6:19] happen around us lord and it
[6:21] and sometimes just gets us so frustrated
[6:23] and so down lord and such a pleasure
[6:25] that comes upon the believer to think
[6:27] that
[6:28] we have to perform or act in a certain
[6:30] way
[6:31] for you to come and dwell by us
[6:35] and to come our way lord but lord you
[6:38] already know before we pray every word

[33:01] of the lord jesus christ that sanitizer
[33:03] is the word of god tonight
[33:05] the master chief sanitizer
[33:08] amen that can sanitize your life
[33:12] that sanitizer can clean you
[33:15] for good you don't need to sanitize
[33:18] tomorrow and
[33:18] after every hour it will sanitize you
[33:21] once
[33:22] and for all hallelujah that is the
[33:25] sanitizer that i'm talking about amen
[33:28] so let me just uh look
[33:31] here we then we'll read a scripture then
[33:32] we'll sit down amen
[33:35] we are living in a perilous times
[33:38] we are living in a very difficult and
[33:40] challenging times
[33:42] but at the same time we are living in
[33:44] glorious times
[33:46] we are living in both perilous dangerous
[33:49] disastrous times but we are living also
[33:53] in glorious
[33:54] times that is the situation we find
[33:57] ourselves
[33:57] in tonight and that is the situation
[34:00] that i'd like to prepare your minds and
[34:02] your hearts to understand
[34:04] that we are living in dangerous times
[34:06] it's not a
[34:07] play game marvel's times but at the same
[34:10] time
[34:11] these are the heavenly times which we
[34:14] are living in amen
[34:15] you realize as we go along that the
[34:17] reason why is
[34:19] perilous or dangerous times and is also
[34:21] glorious times
[34:22] the reason is because both the devil and
[34:25] god
[34:26] have brought the best of the best for
[34:28] them
[34:30] both god and the devil have brought the
[34:33] best
[34:34] they have brought everything of the best
[34:38] in these times that is why it's both
[34:40] perilous
[34:41] and glorious time because the lord
[34:44] and the devil because it is the end time
[34:48] you see we are living in the end of the
[34:51] end
[34:52] demonic forces all
[34:55] everything darkest forces are here
[35:00] but at the same time angelic forces are
[35:03] also here
[35:04] so so it is a very crucial time because
[35:07] both sides
[35:08] have brought everything you see you
[35:11] understand that
[35:13] everything when it comes to the end
[35:16] everything
[35:17] when it comes to completion completion
[35:20] huh are you with me everything when it
[35:23] comes to there
[35:24] it becomes very dangerous it becomes
[35:26] very hectic very challenging when you
[35:28] build your house
[35:29] we can start with the foundation
[35:30] everything and do everything
[35:32] but when it comes to the finishing
[35:35] when it comes to the finishings most
[35:36] people they know we can play a game the
[35:39] whole 90 minutes
[35:40] but when it comes to the last minutes we
[35:44] even call them danger times
[35:47] those are injury times
[35:50] those are dangerous times because
[35:52] anything can happen
[35:54] many years ago there was a our country
[35:56] was playing with brazil
[35:58] and we scored two goals before half time
[36:00] soccer now
[36:01] and then we we thought we won the game
[36:04] it went on it went on it went on
[36:06] brazil drew 2-2 we went on 90 minutes
[36:10] just at the last minute at the very
[36:13] dangerous
[36:14] injury time brazil scored
[36:17] then it was three to when we lost
[36:20] because
[36:20] those are dangerous times you never ever
[36:24] relax
[36:26] in those times and those are the times
[36:27] we are living in
[36:29] so that i didn't have a better example
[36:31] but everything when it
[36:32] when it's at the end is usually crucial
[36:36] and you cannot filled in the
[36:40] weakest player you cannot field in
[36:43] the the weakling at the end what am i
[36:46] saying to you
[36:47] i'm saying to you god tonight has
[36:50] brought in this age
[36:52] the best to finish this game
[36:57] and i'm talking to the best right now
[36:59] god has brought the best
[37:01] because god cannot bring the weakling
[37:04] let's redo it we are going to read from
[37:08] the book of um
[37:12] i can't control this one my brother hey
[37:16] maybe gaby can give me that little thing
[37:18] to press
[37:21] um we are going to read from the book of
[37:22] zechariah chapter four
[37:26] and i'll find it here because
[37:29] i've just lost you thank you brother
[37:31] quran
[37:34] thank you thank you man of god okay i've
[37:36] got it on the screen
[37:38] so i believe you trust me hey
[37:41] so i may not have to open my bible
[37:43] because i copied and
[37:44] i copied from here then i put it there
[37:48] amen
[37:50] god bless you so
[37:54] let's read zechariah chapter four verse
[37:56] one to seven just bear with me
[37:58] as soon as we finish reading it i assure
[38:00] you you can enjoy the comfort of our
[38:02] uses
[38:03] as soon as we finish amen
[38:06] let's read it i would like you to read
[38:08] with me in your hearts just follow
[38:10] you you you just put all your thoughts
[38:13] in the lord tonight
[38:14] not on brother and paul because me
[38:16] there's nothing that i can do for you
[38:18] you probably knew that you know my
[38:21] weaknesses
[38:22] you may know my my weak points it may be
[38:25] that we were on lunch the other day
[38:27] and i was in front of you and there was
[38:29] only piece of cake left and i finished
[38:30] it so
[38:32] so you know such weaknesses that i
[38:34] didn't let me leave you at peace
[38:35] so right now it's not time for you to
[38:37] focus on
[38:38] me it's time for you to focus on the one
[38:41] who brought you
[38:42] here i didn't bring you here i did not
[38:44] say go to church
[38:46] and i did not say come and sit here and
[38:48] listen you came
[38:50] by the grace of god and the one who
[38:52] brought you here is the one who is going
[38:54] to talk
[38:55] because he we can all sit down he can
[38:58] use this pulpit
[38:59] to preach so therefore i'm trying to say
[39:02] forget about me
[39:04] we'll talk about the cake later later on
[39:06] amen zechariah chapter four
[39:09] and the angel that talked with me came
[39:13] again and walked me
[39:15] as a man that is weakened out of his
[39:18] sleep
[39:19] and said unto me what see us now
[39:22] and i said i have looked and and behold
[39:26] a candlestick of gold with a ball
[39:29] upon the top of it and his seven lamp
[39:33] and his seven lamps there on and seven
[39:35] pipes
[39:36] or to the seven lamps which are upon
[39:38] their top
[39:39] thereof the two olive trees
[39:42] by eat upon one upon the
[39:45] the right side of the bowl and the other
[39:47] upon the
[39:48] left side thereof so i answered and
[39:51] speak to the angel
[39:52] that to the angel that talked with me
[39:55] saying
[39:56] what are these my lord then then the
[39:59] angel
[40:00] that talked with me answered and said
[40:02] unto me no
[40:04] no as thou not what this be and i said
[40:07] no
[40:07] my lord then he answered and spake unto
[40:10] me saying
[40:11] this is the word of the lord unto
[40:14] zerubbabel saying not by might
[40:17] not by power but by my spirit
[40:21] saith the lord of hosts who are thou
[40:24] o great mountain before zerubbabel
[40:27] that thou shalt become a plane
[40:31] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[40:34] thereof
[40:34] with shoutings cryings grace
[40:38] grace and to eat amen let's pray
[40:41] together our heavenly father
[40:43] lord once again we have read your word
[40:46] lord
[40:47] i pray that you bless it i pray that you
[40:50] inspire it lord
[40:52] anyone can open this bible but master it
[40:55] is only you
[40:56] who can interpret it who can inspire it
[41:00] it is only you lord who can uniquely
[41:02] come and talk to your children
[41:04] in a special way lord jesus i pray that
[41:07] you bless
[41:07] us this evening even as you promise in
[41:10] your word
[41:10] that where two or three are gathered in
[41:12] my name
[41:14] i shall be there we believe that with
[41:16] lord jesus
[41:17] we commit this service into your hands
[41:19] in the wonderful name of our lord jesus
[41:21] christ i pray
[41:22] amen amen please have your seats
[41:25] finally my introduction was a bit long
[41:28] eh
[41:30] but i know that you've already
[41:32] unconditionally forgiven me
[41:34] thank you so much right
[41:38] now so we
[41:42] oh is it finished
[41:46] oh yeah oh ye thank you
[41:50] god bless you so we we we have read in
[41:53] the book of survival and now
[41:55] we have seen we have seen the title
[41:57] there prior to that slide that is there
[42:00] i've written overcoming power part one
[42:02] amen so so we
[42:04] we're going to take it easy tonight
[42:06] because i'll call it
[42:07] part one so there will be part two part
[42:11] three
[42:11] part four as long as the rapture carries
[42:14] amen and then then then we'll we'll
[42:17] we'll enjoy the word of god how many are
[42:19] hungry tonight
[42:21] i'm very hungry we will enjoy the word
[42:24] of god as it unfolds
[42:25] no rush amen then we'll see up to what
[42:28] part will we get to amen
[42:30] are we right that's that's our title
[42:33] tonight overcoming power
[42:35] one our subject will take
[42:38] not by might not by power but by my
[42:41] spirit
[42:42] say the lord it's not me who said that
[42:44] it was the lord
[42:46] it was the lord in the book of zechariah
[42:48] who said these are the words that came
[42:50] to zerubbabel
[42:52] when he was looking at the candlesticks
[42:55] yeah who who when i say candlesticks
[42:59] and they were burning what do you think
[43:02] of
[43:03] what are you remembering don't you
[43:05] remember the seven church ages
[43:06] don't you remember the vision that john
[43:08] saw are you not thinking of that
[43:11] i'm not thinking about those seven
[43:13] candlesticks
[43:14] in and and there were seven stars
[43:17] in the hand of the lord i want you to
[43:19] think along those lines amen
[43:21] but our topic our title or our heading
[43:24] is that not by mind nor by power but by
[43:27] my spirit
[43:30] but now the question is we say
[43:32] overcoming power we we all know what
[43:35] overcoming power is
[43:36] and we all want it but the bible says no
[43:39] not by mind no by power
[43:42] so so are we talking of two powers
[43:45] yes we are talking of two powers because
[43:48] it's not by my own power
[43:50] or the china's power or any superpowers
[43:53] power
[43:54] but by the spirit of the lord so it's
[43:57] not about
[43:58] what brother paul can do what what what
[44:00] chicana tabernacle can do
[44:01] what our pastor can do it's not about
[44:03] our abilities it's not about what we can
[44:06] do hence i said to you don't focus on me
[44:09] because it's not my power it's not by my
[44:12] training but my ability or
[44:14] any minister for that matter welcome
[44:15] brother marion i missed you
[44:17] god bless you so it is by the spirit
[44:21] of the lord tonight and that's where our
[44:23] focus is
[44:24] i want you to really focus on it because
[44:27] i won't be long
[44:29] we will be finished before you know it
[44:31] amen
[44:33] so let's read again
[44:36] the book of nehemiah chapter four
[44:39] i'll read it for you you can get it in
[44:41] your bibles i don't think you have to
[44:42] display them
[44:43] my brother because what i've displayed
[44:44] there is exactly
[44:46] what is in nehemiah chapter four i'm not
[44:49] lying to
[44:50] you amen he says
[44:54] they which build that on the wall and
[44:56] they that bear
[44:57] burdens with those that laid let it
[45:01] everyone everyone with one of his hands
[45:04] wrote in the work and with the other
[45:07] hand
[45:07] held a weapon this is during the time of
[45:10] the rebuilding of the temple of
[45:11] jerusalem
[45:13] this is during the the great tough time
[45:17] this is during perilous times of the
[45:20] nation of
[45:21] israel when the jews came out of babylon
[45:24] and they were building a city and the
[45:27] king gave permission
[45:28] of the land of the captivity and they
[45:30] were now rebuilding the
[45:32] city just like the one to do now to
[45:35] rebuild it
[45:36] right those are the hard times
[45:39] so the bible says verse 18 for the
[45:42] builders everyone had
[45:43] his sword gathered by his side and so
[45:47] build it they were having a sword
[45:50] and they were building and he that's
[45:52] that sound that the trumpet was by me
[45:54] in other words if you read some ways one
[45:57] hand was building
[45:58] one hand was having a thought so can you
[46:01] can you ever think about
[46:02] what kind of a time was it can you i
[46:05] cannot remember
[46:06] brother isaac taking a video and
[46:09] fighting at the same time
[46:11] i can't remember doing the vlog and
[46:15] fighting at the same time
[46:16] and i can't remember the ban also
[46:18] building his concrete and doing
[46:20] or and fighting at the same time but
[46:23] guess what
[46:24] it is happening today you are currently
[46:27] doing you are a temple that is being
[46:29] built
[46:30] and you are fighting and you are
[46:32] building at the same time
[46:35] that is possible because the old
[46:38] testament
[46:39] was overshadowing the new testament they
[46:42] were building
[46:43] and they succeeded the lord is building
[46:46] today
[46:46] and he's going to succeed through you we
[46:49] heard on sunday
[46:50] that the lord is not going to come here
[46:52] himself he's going to use you
[46:54] right so today it is happening you are
[46:57] the temple
[46:58] that is being built at the same time you
[47:01] are at war
[47:03] man i cannot imagine it it's just too
[47:05] difficult to build
[47:06] and to fight and it happened brothers
[47:08] and sisters for real
[47:10] they were fighting at the same time they
[47:12] were building
[47:13] imagine putting a brick and then with a
[47:16] sword
[47:17] too and the enemy comes you kick him
[47:19] there and you're building why
[47:21] it was a serious time it was a time
[47:24] of building the temple to restore the
[47:27] temple worship
[47:29] it was that time and that time was
[47:31] foreseeing
[47:32] this time it was a shadow to our time
[47:35] today the bible tells us that we are
[47:38] fighting against principalities
[47:41] we are not just sitting and waiting for
[47:43] the rapture to happen we are fighting
[47:45] amen for that overcoming power to
[47:48] operate we are fighting at the same time
[47:51] that the same time the temple is being
[47:53] built
[47:53] to completion so that a full dwelling so
[47:56] that the rapture can take place so that
[47:58] everything that the lord spoke in the
[48:00] bible can take place
[48:01] so that you can be a fully fleshed
[48:03] overcomer
[48:05] that's what we are talking about this
[48:06] evening are we together
[48:09] that's the thinking to understand that
[48:11] they were fighting
[48:12] and building you are fighting and
[48:15] building the lord is building through
[48:16] you
[48:17] you are part of the equation the lord is
[48:20] not just fighting for you
[48:22] and your city no no you and the lord are
[48:25] in this thing too
[48:27] say together we are together
[48:31] you know so sorry those that are new
[48:35] i like to interact my sister so if you
[48:38] just hear me calling your name please
[48:40] just bear with me because i'd like to
[48:42] make sure that my audience
[48:43] is alert amen otherwise the train will
[48:46] pass
[48:47] on the platform and you you are
[48:49] wondering what happened to the tree
[48:51] amen so i i'd like to to keep each one
[48:54] interactive amen
[48:55] let's read revelation let's do
[48:58] revelation two
[49:00] and three we are going to read various
[49:01] verses but what i want to highlight for
[49:03] you
[49:04] is that where they overcome overcoming
[49:08] can anybody and i don't know what they
[49:10] call it in them
[49:13] in english but you see a patented
[49:17] of the word overcome
[49:20] revelation is a book of symbols you see
[49:22] a pattern
[49:23] of the word overcome is repeated in
[49:26] every
[49:27] verse where the lord speaks to a certain
[49:30] church age
[49:31] or the messenger of a certain church age
[49:33] can you see it
[49:34] i didn't i didn't capture all the verses
[49:36] but i just captured where
[49:38] it brings the word overcometh because
[49:41] there is a power given brothers and
[49:43] sisters for me and for you
[49:45] to overcome today
[49:50] today look where you started the babel
[49:54] there were seven candlesticks daniel
[49:57] saw the vision of the end times the
[49:59] bible says he saw it
[50:01] and he saw that statue right that image
[50:04] right john in the isle of patmos also
[50:07] saw
[50:07] he even went into the preview of the
[50:10] bride
[50:11] are we together so those things we're
[50:13] all talking about
[50:15] this time hebrews chapter 11 or is it 11
[50:19] or 13
[50:20] when he talks about his is the faith
[50:23] chapter which one who are my bible
[50:24] readers
[50:25] hebrews chapter 11 at the end when you
[50:29] read
[50:29] it talks about great men and women who
[50:32] fought
[50:32] who were in lion's dens and who were in
[50:35] dances
[50:35] in sheepskins suffering but the bible
[50:38] says
[50:39] they did not see this day and it's the
[50:41] bible says
[50:42] even this world was not worthy
[50:46] of them but those guys they did not see
[50:49] this time but they were yelling and
[50:51] waiting to be
[50:52] here why because this is the very
[50:55] end of the end this is a very serious
[50:57] time
[50:58] and the devil what he wants to do he
[51:01] specializes in
[51:03] a spirit of shallowness
[51:06] the spirit of shallowness make you to
[51:09] think in a shallow
[51:11] or shallow in africa we say shallow i
[51:13] don't know about you here
[51:14] not too shallow when you walk in a
[51:17] little pond
[51:19] and the water just come up to here you
[51:21] say oh this point is shallow
[51:22] it's not deep isn't it it's not deep you
[51:25] cannot really drown in that kind of a
[51:27] pond
[51:28] you just walk past isn't it it's shallow
[51:30] but when it's deep
[51:33] everything can be there
[51:36] amen so the devil
[51:39] specializes in the way of
[51:42] making people to to think shallow
[51:46] when it comes to things that will
[51:47] benefit you
[51:49] in the sense that now we have said we
[51:52] are living in perilous times we are
[51:54] living in difficult and glorious times
[51:57] but now it seems if you you you go
[52:00] around there walking
[52:01] nobody seems to be recognizing or seeing
[52:05] the times that we are living in nobody
[52:08] i was sitting at my office and i'm
[52:10] saying you know what i wish they can
[52:11] just give me a mic
[52:13] just to announce and say brothers and
[52:14] sisters we are living in perilous times
[52:18] do you understand the times that we are
[52:20] living in are you aware
[52:22] that the kingdom of god is nigh
[52:25] i i wish i could tell them i wish i
[52:28] could i could
[52:30] i could use facebook or anything to say
[52:32] brothers and sisters whoa i understand
[52:35] scientists are are confused nature is
[52:38] confused
[52:40] nations are are fearing
[52:43] they are getting more confused
[52:46] they don't know what's happening nobody
[52:48] seems to understand
[52:49] but there is a solution there is an
[52:52] answer
[52:53] provided already and then me and you
[52:56] know it
[52:57] how can that be shallow how can that be
[53:01] shallow how can does that be all it's
[53:03] just all the
[53:04] you know the church people how can that
[53:06] be
[53:07] but let's forget about them do you
[53:10] realize
[53:12] the times where we are do you
[53:15] understand who you are do you really
[53:18] understand
[53:19] or because there's a difference between
[53:23] to know who you are and to think you
[53:26] know who you are
[53:29] there needs to be a revelation a clear
[53:31] cut revelation where
[53:32] your fish has eaten both the hook
[53:36] and the line and the sink
[53:41] everything where there's no other option
[53:46] there was a man in america he was a
[53:49] leader
[53:51] of the indian the indian people
[53:54] and you know he 44 the prophet speaks
[53:57] about him
[53:58] and after fighting his people were dying
[54:02] and now he said i will fight no more
[54:04] forever
[54:05] he took a resolution i will fight no
[54:07] more forever
[54:08] which means you come to a point where
[54:10] you know that backwards
[54:12] never only for what
[54:15] i go and also in italy when julius
[54:18] caesar
[54:19] was fighting with his men they say he
[54:21] crossed a river
[54:23] he took his soldiers and they crossed a
[54:25] river because he was a
[54:27] shrewd powerful soldier
[54:30] and they crossed a river of rubicon
[54:34] when they crossed that river rubicon
[54:36] they burned or they burn their boats and
[54:38] destroy them
[54:40] meaning what you are not coming back
[54:45] for what we go you you need to come to a
[54:48] point in your life
[54:49] where you know that you know
[54:53] that the world cannot do anything to you
[54:57] and you are not going to turn to the
[55:00] left or to the right
[55:02] not a wishy-washy brother brandon calls
[55:04] them dirty weak
[55:06] believer where you are have you ever
[55:09] seen a log
[55:10] floating in the river a big lock and you
[55:14] are amazed how is that big thing
[55:16] floating like that this water must be
[55:17] powerful
[55:18] meanwhile that log is actually empty
[55:20] inside
[55:22] ah in the message
[55:26] how can i overcome that's what we are
[55:28] going to read some of the pieces there
[55:29] the prophet says that lock
[55:31] is so you you you you you know go go go
[55:34] go go it's empty
[55:35] but it looks strong and big
[55:39] it's shallow so we we're not supposed to
[55:42] allow the devil
[55:43] to bring us to that point we have to
[55:46] pray and live our lives in such a way
[55:49] that that demonstrates that we
[55:51] know who we are where we are coming from
[55:53] where we are going
[55:55] both spiritual and physical
[55:58] i'm not just talking about spiritual
[56:00] life where we are too spiritual no
[56:03] including physical things day-to-day
[56:07] things
[56:08] where if i i i i offend my brother or i
[56:11] offend my brother or i'll offend my
[56:13] brother i'll be humble enough
[56:15] to say a man of god i'm sorry to say god
[56:18] bless you
[56:19] and to mean it not to please him no
[56:22] we we those are the things that the
[56:25] devil attacks believers to make things
[56:27] shallow to say oh i'm sorry i'm sorry
[56:30] not not meaning it who do you think you
[56:33] are deceiving
[56:35] god or your brother because if your
[56:38] brother for the spirit of the lord
[56:40] his his spirit will tell him that can
[56:43] you forgive him but he's not asking for
[56:44] forgiveness
[56:45] the spirit of the lord the days of
[56:48] ananias and sapphira safir
[56:49] are here and those were not the shallow
[56:52] days
[56:54] no when we pray in there and you can
[56:57] hear us
[56:58] and something tells you that they are
[57:00] playing and something
[57:02] is still simple voice say join and you
[57:04] don't join
[57:07] why do you want to remain shallow
[57:13] all right best servant of revelation 2
[57:16] to him that overcome it will i give to
[57:19] eat
[57:20] of the three tree of life which is in
[57:23] the midst of the paradise
[57:24] this was paradise of god this was for
[57:27] ephesians
[57:28] ephesus verse 11 he that overcometh
[57:31] shall not be heard of the second death
[57:35] these are promises these are truths
[57:38] these are not lies these things are
[57:40] going to happen more real than the way
[57:42] you see us now
[57:43] they are going to happen there's going
[57:46] to be a second death
[57:47] but there's those people who are not
[57:48] good going to be affected by the second
[57:50] death those are the overcomers
[57:55] to him perseverant to him that overcome
[57:58] it will i give to it
[57:59] of the hidden manner and will give him
[58:01] the white stone
[58:03] and in the stone and made a new name
[58:05] written
[58:06] which no man know it saying saving he
[58:09] that receives it
[58:12] you know i like what brother ben said
[58:14] everything from the first
[58:16] church age is almost like combined
[58:19] stuck here all the powers
[58:22] the developers pulled all the plugs 250
[58:26] million demons
[58:27] have been released you tell me how many
[58:31] angels have been released
[58:34] ah and we know our law does not work
[58:36] with that number
[58:37] no our law does not count as one two
[58:40] three million good one two billion no
[58:42] yes you can have the numbers but our our
[58:45] lord weighs
[58:46] us you know our lord weighs us my boy he
[58:50] does not count one two three twenty how
[58:52] we will win no
[58:53] he's a good we can win but he weighs us
[58:57] he weighs the spirit in us that's why
[59:00] the holy spirit is given to us in a
[59:02] measure
[59:04] otherwise if the lord can give you a
[59:05] full full then
[59:07] then you know we are still in flesh
[59:11] we are given the spirit of god with a
[59:13] measure
[59:14] according to the gifts right but
[59:16] everything that is in that little
[59:17] teaspoon
[59:20] you find it in all the qualities brother
[59:22] john are in that little spoon
[59:24] that's your measure right everything
[59:27] combined makes the whole the whole
[59:28] bright
[59:29] the point that i'm trying to say i
[59:31] forgot it is that oh yeah here
[59:33] god weighs us he does not count
[59:36] us he count us but he weighs us
[59:40] that oh this is me
[59:43] this is part of me and it this is just
[59:46] me the oh
[59:47] what exact size that's exactly how i saw
[59:50] andy
[59:51] he has arrived seal him closed packed
[59:55] that one sealed packed that one you know
[59:58] that's how god works but the devil
[1:00:00] thinks he can outnumber god
[1:00:02] that is why him he recruited so many and
[1:00:05] thinking that by taking two thirds
[1:00:07] he will win god doesn't work like that
[1:00:10] let's read 26
[1:00:11] and he that overcome it and keep at my
[1:00:13] worst until the end did you hear that
[1:00:15] brothers and sisters
[1:00:17] did you hear that friends
[1:00:20] to him will i give power over the
[1:00:23] nations
[1:00:25] dietera all these things up to verse 21
[1:00:28] to him that overcometh
[1:00:29] i will grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:00:34] who am i to sit on the throne of god
[1:00:38] i must be someone very important i must
[1:00:41] be someone very important
[1:00:43] huh i must be someone very very crucial
[1:00:45] very meaningful
[1:00:47] in the kingdom of god despite the fact
[1:00:49] that i'm an
[1:00:50] overcomer because overcoming just
[1:00:53] it comes to reflect who actually you
[1:00:56] were
[1:00:57] or you are right but remember
[1:01:00] we are not saying all these things or we
[1:01:02] should not be saying all these things
[1:01:04] with pride because god hates
[1:01:07] a proud heart you know you know
[1:01:11] there was a prime there was a a minister
[1:01:13] some time ago during the first lockdown
[1:01:15] they put their lock down lock us in the
[1:01:18] houses and nobody must go anywhere
[1:01:20] and that minister go to the beach
[1:01:24] and he's jogging or riding a bicycle and
[1:01:26] minister
[1:01:28] you see that man he does not understand
[1:01:30] his position
[1:01:32] he does not know who he supposed to be
[1:01:36] or who's watching or who is he leading
[1:01:41] there was an ambassador in my country an
[1:01:43] ambassador is like
[1:01:45] you know an ambassador you get sent to
[1:01:48] another country
[1:01:50] to represent another your country when
[1:01:52] you are there
[1:01:53] you represent the just like when you are
[1:01:55] here we represent
[1:01:56] heaven heaven is i'm talking to heaven
[1:01:59] now
[1:02:01] okay that ambassador wendy now
[1:02:05] he did silly things and ambassador
[1:02:09] in the offices he ended up even breaking
[1:02:11] the furniture on his drunk and
[1:02:13] everything and ambassador
[1:02:15] so you see this man does not know who he
[1:02:19] is he doesn't understand his position
[1:02:22] he does not know who he represent he
[1:02:25] doesn't know
[1:02:26] who he is but his wife's behaving like
[1:02:29] that so
[1:02:30] us we are supposed to be like that young
[1:02:33] man
[1:02:34] that we were told that when he was in
[1:02:36] america
[1:02:37] during slavery he was behaving and
[1:02:39] conducting himself
[1:02:41] as like a king a son of the king because
[1:02:44] back home where he came from
[1:02:45] he's a king being in america in slavery
[1:02:48] land or what wherever he can go
[1:02:51] does not change who he is you are a
[1:02:54] daughter
[1:02:54] and a son of god despite all the
[1:02:57] circumstances
[1:02:58] despite all the trials despite all the
[1:03:00] problems despite
[1:03:02] everything that you went through in fact
[1:03:04] all those things when they come to you
[1:03:06] when you go through the fire through the
[1:03:08] water through everything
[1:03:10] it's a demonstration that you are a son
[1:03:13] of god so you need not worry
[1:03:16] you need not worry about where you came
[1:03:18] from what you went through
[1:03:20] and cry no what matters is where
[1:03:23] are you now and the word is your
[1:03:26] destination
[1:03:27] that's what you're focusing on that
[1:03:29] brother john did not speak to me well
[1:03:31] no i must not even wait for him to
[1:03:33] apologize to me
[1:03:34] already i must forgive him
[1:03:37] unconditionally
[1:03:38] without him asking me brother i'm very
[1:03:40] sorry man
[1:03:41] you brought you borrowed me your car and
[1:03:43] i didn't drive it well
[1:03:44] before he do that i must already forgive
[1:03:48] him
[1:03:49] unconditionally and be ready to borrow
[1:03:51] him again
[1:03:56] i don't know who can do that if a young
[1:03:59] man can
[1:04:00] misuse you know imagine brother cooper
[1:04:03] the holden
[1:04:07] and and a young man you borrow them out
[1:04:10] of respect
[1:04:12] out of understanding then they go
[1:04:15] you know i recently i recently scratched
[1:04:18] the car for the church myself
[1:04:22] so
[1:04:25] but that is not on purpose me i'm an
[1:04:26] adult isn't it
[1:04:29] the point i'm trying to tell you is that
[1:04:32] we as daughters and sons of god
[1:04:37] has not met our culture doesn't matter
[1:04:40] our race
[1:04:42] doesn't matter our upbringing doesn't
[1:04:45] matter
[1:04:45] our history it doesn't matter
[1:04:48] our family faith or whatever
[1:04:52] doesn't matter it does not even matter
[1:04:56] who your father or your mother is
[1:04:59] you are a son and a daughter of god they
[1:05:01] say
[1:05:03] the word of god your nature that lord
[1:05:06] the lord has transformed it
[1:05:08] all those things they become subject to
[1:05:10] it
[1:05:11] they become does not matter the only
[1:05:14] thing that matters
[1:05:15] is that all those things are part of my
[1:05:17] testimony
[1:05:20] hallelujah those are part of your
[1:05:22] testimony friends
[1:05:23] therefore nobody can make you do
[1:05:26] something nobody
[1:05:27] can make you think otherwise nobody can
[1:05:30] make you act otherwise
[1:05:31] no no no you are a son and a daughter
[1:05:34] and you need to behave like wise
[1:05:36] and me and you has to conduct ourselves

[1:09:39] we are we are under a leadership of the
[1:09:41] holy spirit
[1:09:43] the holy ghost is among us and we are
[1:09:45] here to be
[1:09:46] to take reckoning among us recording
[1:09:50] to see where our short places
[1:09:54] are our shortcoming
[1:09:57] and how can we catch from where we
[1:09:59] should be
[1:10:01] that's why we are here we are not there
[1:10:04] to be told no no no no
[1:10:05] just continue you are part of the bride
[1:10:09] only not only that yes you are part of
[1:10:11] the bride

[1:10:14] going to be told yes michael becker
[1:10:16] do it my girl you are a daughter of the
[1:10:19] most high god
[1:10:20] he's all right now we are not here to
[1:10:23] brush each other's ego
[1:10:26] to polish one another that's not what we
[1:10:28] are here brother benfo
[1:10:29] we are here to say no pradampo i think
[1:10:31] you are wrong there my friend
[1:10:34] look in your brother in the face like
[1:10:35] this with love not with anger with love
[1:10:38] and say my friend
[1:10:39] i think there you go to draw my brother
[1:10:42] i want to show you something what paul
[1:10:43] said here
[1:10:44] what the prophet said but i i mean not
[1:10:46] the scripture
[1:10:47] but i feel that the way you are speaking
[1:10:49] to me
[1:10:51] is not approved of the weight so why do
[1:10:54] we shy
[1:10:54] from doing such things in new zealand i
[1:10:57] found that ah
[1:10:58] people mind their own business
[1:11:01] sort of i don't know if you should say
[1:11:03] we are passive
[1:11:05] oh yeah you know you can't you can't i i
[1:11:08] i go into a bus every morning
[1:11:10] and then every morning i see three girls
[1:11:14] every morning i see three girls two of
[1:11:17] them
[1:11:17] are siblings one i don't know if it's a
[1:11:20] friend or is a relative
[1:11:22] but they know each other so every
[1:11:24] morning they're there
[1:11:26] the one who's alone is eating her chips
[1:11:27] she's eating her snacks
[1:11:29] and she's so mean to the other two
[1:11:33] every day i see it she's so mean
[1:11:37] she he shows things that i can't even
[1:11:39] show in the pulpit to them
[1:11:41] he just walked on the pavement the
[1:11:42] little girl is standing there she just
[1:11:43] walked she just
[1:11:45] she just hit and bumped
[1:11:48] every day the little girl just moved for
[1:11:50] her
[1:11:52] the other big girl there's the same
[1:11:54] height
[1:11:55] the the bigger to that one she's trying
[1:11:58] but you can see she's dominating on them
[1:12:00] she's got a spirit of dominance and
[1:12:01] wanting to
[1:12:02] to bully them every day
[1:12:06] so i have to think of my ways
[1:12:10] as a parent as a christian how can i
[1:12:12] help this girl
[1:12:14] and i knew that i can i can touch a very
[1:12:18] dangerous area
[1:12:20] because i may i may find the parent of
[1:12:22] this child at my gate
[1:12:23] coming to tell me because this is
[1:12:26] laodicea
[1:12:27] the rights this is laodicea
[1:12:30] no more the times where i can correct
[1:12:32] debbie and
[1:12:33] say michael come you never ever speak to
[1:12:38] brother ben like that okay never ever
[1:12:40] this is the last time okay my girl
[1:12:42] never otherwise the jew is gonna come to
[1:12:45] my house
[1:12:48] so this morning
[1:12:51] the lord just laid in my heart i greeted
[1:12:54] them they say hello
[1:12:55] all the three of them hello hello hi and
[1:12:58] his cold is freezing
[1:12:59] it was cold she has freezing i say yeah
[1:13:01] then i saw her doing that again
[1:13:04] then i say i just walk next to them i
[1:13:06] say hi
[1:13:07] tell me something then she listen
[1:13:09] attentively tell me
[1:13:11] i said to her why are you always mean to
[1:13:13] them
[1:13:16] oh you know what that girl
[1:13:19] i saw blood you know on his skin i i saw
[1:13:22] a tiny
[1:13:23] rain he did not expect me to ask such a
[1:13:25] question
[1:13:28] now the little girl was so excited she
[1:13:32] was so happy
[1:13:33] to say oh you know what this must be an
[1:13:35] angel
[1:13:38] and the big one was just quiet she
[1:13:40] didn't know where exactly am i coming
[1:13:42] from
[1:13:43] so that that one never answered me she
[1:13:46] just was she was just stunned
[1:13:48] i never reprimanded her i just asked a
[1:13:51] question
[1:13:52] why are you always mean to them he never
[1:13:55] said i'm not
[1:13:56] he never said nothing he just became red
[1:14:00] and you know when someone is trying to
[1:14:02] and they can't talk
[1:14:04] so we need to be able to get to a point
[1:14:06] where we
[1:14:08] correct one another with love and show
[1:14:10] one another and
[1:14:11] and not take it personal afterwards you
[1:14:14] who is corrected
[1:14:15] and you who are correcting if you don't
[1:14:17] receive the correction
[1:14:19] and you don't give it you're both guilty
[1:14:22] did we know that we are both guilty
[1:14:25] because you can say
[1:14:26] your brother is in the wrong you can see
[1:14:28] your sister is in the wrong but you're
[1:14:29] not telling him with love and
[1:14:31] there's still small voices telling you
[1:14:34] how is he going to overcome
[1:14:37] brother i didn't preach to someone he
[1:14:39] said we are the people who are the
[1:14:41] source of giving eternal life
[1:14:44] and eternal life starts by me living for
[1:14:47] you
[1:14:47] you living for me i don't know why i'm
[1:14:50] going that route
[1:14:52] i'm going there because of that quote
[1:14:55] this is why we are here how can we catch
[1:14:57] from where we
[1:14:59] and how can we catch from where we
[1:15:01] should be
[1:15:02] over to where we ought to be now
[1:15:05] we are where we are and
[1:15:09] this is brother brennan's english story
[1:15:11] and where we ought to be
[1:15:14] in that message how can i overcome he
[1:15:17] says
[1:15:17] you've got to be no no no no that's a
[1:15:20] different thought
[1:15:21] but the point of that that quote about
[1:15:23] that i read those two paragraphs
[1:15:25] is that when we are absorbent
[1:15:30] to the correction of by the word of god
[1:15:32] we overcome
[1:15:34] we get to a point where we overcome
[1:15:36] where it's easier for us to overcome
[1:15:38] unlike when we are we are we are
[1:15:41] protectionists
[1:15:42] you know protectionist is someone when
[1:15:45] you say
[1:15:46] um brother ben you know this shoes no no
[1:15:50] i know
[1:15:53] oh brother ben i was just saying
[1:15:54] yesterday i i know
[1:15:56] i was just saying yesterday i was
[1:15:58] greeting you you didn't see me
[1:16:00] no i didn't see that's the protection
[1:16:02] defense defense mechanism
[1:16:05] hello bradampo how are you feeling today
[1:16:07] i heard that yes i'm fine i'm fine
[1:16:10] you see without even hearing what the
[1:16:12] brother wants to say
[1:16:14] you're already defending defending what
[1:16:16] because the brother hasn't said anything
[1:16:18] the sister hasn't said anything yes yeah
[1:16:20] sometimes we don't even say it without
[1:16:22] our mouths we say it in our hearts
[1:16:26] we in our hearts we already say ah who
[1:16:28] does he think he is
[1:16:30] in our hearts who does marion thinks he
[1:16:33] knows too much
[1:16:35] who does he think he thinks he can tell
[1:16:37] me okay
[1:16:39] sometimes we don't even say it with our
[1:16:41] hearts we don't say it
[1:16:42] but we say it with our actions
[1:16:46] our actions our hearts if we are brave
[1:16:49] enough we say it with our with our lips
[1:16:50] we express
[1:16:51] it we say i know you no no you can't
[1:16:53] tell me you
[1:16:55] beg in my country they'll tell you no no
[1:16:56] you can't tell me
[1:17:07] i'm saying good morning
[1:17:11] what's wrong now this system greeting
[1:17:14] yourself
[1:17:16] here that's how we express we are
[1:17:18] different but i said at the beginning
[1:17:20] our culture our upbringing our way of
[1:17:23] doing things our family our everything
[1:17:25] brother andy told me that every country
[1:17:27] has got his own spirit that's what the
[1:17:28] prophet says
[1:17:30] and the chief demon of new zealand makes
[1:17:33] people to be like that
[1:17:35] so that when you meet another one who is
[1:17:38] inspired or
[1:17:39] or who is anointed by the chief demon of
[1:17:41] south africa there's a conflict
[1:17:44] but we are above those things us
[1:17:47] oh sorry we are above those things oh
[1:17:51] what a cramp just
[1:17:55] help me lord jesus amen
[1:18:22] in the name of jesus christ satan you
[1:18:24] have no right to put
[1:18:50] amen amen
[1:18:59] amen are you okay sorry sorry i'm sorry
[1:19:03] i'm very sorry about that brother i had
[1:19:05] very bad creme
[1:19:07] i hope this is not only youtube
[1:19:11] oh that was painful oh i don't know
[1:19:14] where that came from
[1:19:16] but i know that the devil is is playing
[1:19:19] games
[1:19:21] help us lord jesus amen that was very
[1:19:23] painful i never had one like that
[1:19:26] i won't move around amen
[1:19:30] can you continue you can unpause
[1:19:35] please unpause amen
[1:19:40] the enemy is not hating he's trying
[1:19:43] everything
[1:19:45] even yesterday two days ago he tried
[1:19:48] very very hard
[1:19:49] to disrupt me from bringing the thought
[1:19:52] my internet everything went down
[1:19:54] i was battling but i know
[1:19:58] that the enemy is a loser
[1:20:01] and i know for real that i am an
[1:20:03] overcomer
[1:20:05] i know that you are an overcomer i was
[1:20:07] so blessed yesterday when brother fedo
[1:20:09] was preaching i watched that same one
[1:20:11] he said even when you fail the lord
[1:20:14] looks
[1:20:15] and says that's my son and he picks you
[1:20:18] and help you
[1:20:19] he knew the end from the beginning
[1:20:23] so there's nothing that takes the lord
[1:20:24] by surprise i need to hurry up
[1:20:28] right so
[1:20:32] i just thought i should pass that one
[1:20:39] just give the devil a bit of a knock
[1:20:41] there
[1:20:42] so that he can know that
[1:20:46] you are not cheap you are not just
[1:20:49] human beings and we need to teach our
[1:20:52] children and our children's children
[1:20:54] the same that we are sons and daughters
[1:20:57] of god
[1:20:58] confess it and leave it look at it this
[1:21:00] way brothers and sisters
[1:21:02] if the muslims and the lutherans
[1:21:06] and the buddha buddhists and the monks
[1:21:09] can take their religion so seriously
[1:21:14] if they can take their religion so
[1:21:16] seriously to a point where
[1:21:17] some can be crucified you hooked with
[1:21:19] things on your flesh
[1:21:22] that's a spirit operating if
[1:21:25] the catholics can can give themselves
[1:21:27] that i
[1:21:28] am not going to be married i will live
[1:21:31] for the catholic catholicism
[1:21:33] and i'll be taken there for the rest of
[1:21:35] my life
[1:21:38] if a muslim can a a fanatic muslim can
[1:21:43] say
[1:21:44] i can swallow bombs
[1:21:47] and be exploded for allah
[1:21:51] if they can do that me and you believe
[1:21:54] that
[1:21:55] everything is managed or controlled by a
[1:21:56] spirit
[1:21:58] now what are we doing
[1:22:01] until the prophet of god said no the
[1:22:03] minimum you can do
[1:22:05] the minimum is to read your bible every
[1:22:08] day
[1:22:08] and pray every day and read listen to
[1:22:11] the spoken word every day
[1:22:14] there's no we cannot just go for the
[1:22:16] minimum esther
[1:22:18] you know that was it you can't just pass
[1:22:20] on the minimum
[1:22:21] all the time the minimum
[1:22:24] there's a chance that you can go below
[1:22:25] minimum if you do that
[1:22:28] the devil can pull you down to the
[1:22:29] minimum below minimum
[1:22:32] so we cannot we have to
[1:22:35] if we cannot do that every day we have
[1:22:38] to cry
[1:22:40] really cry before god because you see
[1:22:42] the devil has planted this world and
[1:22:44] everything in such a way
[1:22:45] with us in mind he's done everything
[1:22:48] with us in mind
[1:22:49] to to fine-tune everything and set it up
[1:22:51] so that we can fail
[1:22:53] that's how the he he set up everything
[1:22:56] so that the so-called believer of the
[1:22:58] message of the hour
[1:22:59] in the end time he cannot take minimum
[1:23:03] he attacks you even if he sees that you
[1:23:05] are a weak one
[1:23:07] because why the bible says even the
[1:23:09] weakest believer
[1:23:11] when he or she prays sincerely god moves
[1:23:15] the weakest believer the word if you
[1:23:18] consider yourself to be weak
[1:23:21] tonight even you when you pray
[1:23:24] with all your heart yes amen
[1:23:28] sincerely god moves so
[1:23:31] that's the powerful promise let's read
[1:23:34] that one
[1:23:34] let's read that portion
[1:23:38] did i put here okay we have already read
[1:23:41] here
[1:23:42] so i want us to read
[1:23:45] revelation think on my
[1:23:48] on my computer
[1:23:51] i'm not corresponding i'm together now
[1:23:54] revelation 3 verse 19 says as many as i
[1:23:56] love
[1:23:58] i rebuke and just
[1:24:01] so be zealous therefore and repent you
[1:24:04] have repented
[1:24:06] but when you do an error when you go
[1:24:09] below below minimum
[1:24:10] the lord is going to correct you why
[1:24:13] because the lord loves you
[1:24:15] we cannot reject
[1:24:18] correction to a point where it's hard
[1:24:20] for the pastor to preach here
[1:24:22] certain things in church no
[1:24:26] we cannot bring the spirit of new
[1:24:27] zealand or the spirit of africa
[1:24:30] or the spirit of india or the spirit of
[1:24:33] south korea here
[1:24:37] we are not in new zealand we are in
[1:24:39] heavenly places
[1:24:40] in christ jesus we are better than that
[1:24:43] ambassador
[1:24:44] or the minister who when the rules are
[1:24:47] given he goes against them
[1:24:49] a leader so we
[1:24:52] understand the type of a calling that we
[1:24:55] are called
[1:24:56] and our children must understand no
[1:24:59] negotiation
[1:25:01] some may say i'm too strict but god does
[1:25:04] not negotiate with the devil
[1:25:07] god does not sympathize with the
[1:25:09] circumstances of your time you must come
[1:25:12] to church
[1:25:14] only three conditions the prophet says
[1:25:16] if i'm not mistaken
[1:25:17] when you are sick or when you are waking
[1:25:20] or when you are dead
[1:25:23] i think i've edited that one but
[1:25:27] but you cannot stay home and say no
[1:25:31] no i'm not feeling i'm feeling tired
[1:25:35] tired tired brother oh no i'm
[1:25:40] no no pen comes early that's why i pick
[1:25:42] on him he comes regardless
[1:25:44] so you you can't say
[1:25:47] oh you know i think the traffic is gonna
[1:25:49] be dragged
[1:25:52] i don't feel like phil come on
[1:25:56] no brothers and sisters let us take god
[1:25:59] seriously
[1:26:01] let us understand that our calling and
[1:26:04] i'm not saying coming to church
[1:26:06] will make you an overcomer but it's part
[1:26:09] of the process
[1:26:10] because we are not uh forgoing the
[1:26:14] gathering together
[1:26:15] because he brings this leak of fire he's
[1:26:17] liquor fire his liquid fire and all the
[1:26:18] liquid fire
[1:26:19] that's why they were gathered in the
[1:26:21] upper room when the tongues of fire came
[1:26:24] and that has been said from the
[1:26:26] beginning of the
[1:26:27] church ages until today and it will be
[1:26:30] like that until the end
[1:26:32] an effect prayer a available
[1:26:36] we heard on sunday here that a heaven
[1:26:38] prayer what is your favorite prayer
[1:26:41] what is a heaven prayer what does paul
[1:26:42] mean when he says pray without ceasing
[1:26:45] what does he mean what does he mean the
[1:26:48] prophet when he says read the bible
[1:26:50] and pray every day what does that mean
[1:26:52] it means you must do it every day
[1:26:54] whether you feel like or you don't feel
[1:26:56] like
[1:26:58] you must do it because you understand
[1:27:01] your
[1:27:01] calling you understand who you are
[1:27:05] that you are caught you are you
[1:27:09] you have responded to the mark of the
[1:27:11] high calling
[1:27:13] the mark of the high calling is not just
[1:27:16] a law calling
[1:27:18] no no brother sisters i'm trying to pull
[1:27:20] those that are still struggling with
[1:27:22] this
[1:27:22] let's get it clear we cannot allow the
[1:27:26] circumstances of the devil nowadays that
[1:27:28] he has set up to control
[1:27:30] and manipulate us if that is happening
[1:27:32] which i understand
[1:27:33] it can happen to me to you to everyone
[1:27:37] but we cannot allow it we have to resist
[1:27:40] with an equal force
[1:27:42] oh no the best opportunity you get
[1:27:46] you kick and you pray so hard
[1:27:49] that the devil will know that weak he
[1:27:51] won't come near you
[1:27:54] take control of your circumstances and
[1:27:57] say hey
[1:27:59] i am going to pray until this thing
[1:28:01] leaves
[1:28:02] god i'm going to cry the problem is that
[1:28:05] you don't cry
[1:28:07] we don't cry the prophet says if that
[1:28:10] little issue that was in the chicken
[1:28:12] coop never cried
[1:28:14] if it never lived when the mother said
[1:28:16] just leave a little bit just leap
[1:28:19] what would have happened to it
[1:28:22] all it needed to do was just to leave a
[1:28:25] leap
[1:28:25] and the mother picked it up ah
[1:28:28] because it was not sure what is it but
[1:28:31] it knew that it's not part of the
[1:28:32] chicken
[1:28:33] but it didn't know what it was but the
[1:28:35] day the mother screamed
[1:28:38] and he said yes my
[1:28:42] daughter
[1:28:46] revelation started to brew
[1:28:49] so we need to to clear these loose ends
[1:28:53] the prophet calls them loose ends
[1:28:54] we need to clear them before we overcome
[1:28:57] remember this is part one
[1:29:00] this is part one we need to clear
[1:29:03] these abc's this a b
[1:29:06] this r a e o the vowels
[1:29:09] we need to clear them that hey
[1:29:12] so that our the mark of the high calling
[1:29:15] can take is full manifestation in our
[1:29:17] lives
[1:29:18] otherwise we're not going to be talking
[1:29:20] heavenly things and top stuff
[1:29:23] when we can't deal with the abcs when we
[1:29:26] can't deal with attire
[1:29:27] for our sisters attire maybe i'm saying
[1:29:31] it too hard i mean attire
[1:29:32] wearing clothing and we say no no i grew
[1:29:36] up like this
[1:29:37] it's my culture my culture
[1:29:41] that's how i was brought up but it's not
[1:29:43] a problem the prophet said as long as
[1:29:45] it's below my knees
[1:29:47] yes he said it but what does your heart
[1:29:49] say
[1:29:50] what does the holy spirit say in your
[1:29:52] heart are you arguing with it
[1:29:56] i won't go there too much brothers and
[1:29:57] sisters that's not the same one
[1:29:59] the same one is let's clear the abcs
[1:30:02] for us to be overcomers let's clear
[1:30:05] these things off
[1:30:06] i don't know i don't know i can't talk
[1:30:08] to him i'm not like that
[1:30:10] no that's not our culture excuse no no
[1:30:12] no
[1:30:13] no which college are you talking about a
[1:30:16] key one
[1:30:24] no we deal with the problem oh is that
[1:30:26] the culture
[1:30:28] the culture that i know heavenly one is
[1:30:31] that saying that i must talk to you
[1:30:32] with a humble spirit not with my country
[1:30:36] arrogance all my country
[1:30:37] robustness that i'll deal with you know
[1:30:41] that's that's not heavenly i'm just
[1:30:43] comparing those
[1:30:44] i'm from south africa or somehow and
[1:30:46] then you're from
[1:30:47] so i'm just using those as examples but
[1:30:49] i think you'll see the picture
[1:30:51] that i'm trying to bring some of those
[1:30:53] abcs
[1:30:54] have to be got written off as many as i
[1:30:57] love i
[1:30:58] rebuke and i trust him he's zealous and
[1:31:02] repent
[1:31:03] you have repented and you may be amazed
[1:31:05] why is brother talking about repentance
[1:31:07] there's things that the prophet called
[1:31:08] loose ends that creep
[1:31:10] among us to a point where the spirit of
[1:31:15] the lord gets offended
[1:31:17] and things cannot be preached as they
[1:31:19] are supposed to
[1:31:20] someone can get healed someone can get
[1:31:23] delivered
[1:31:24] because you are holding things against
[1:31:27] someone
[1:31:28] what against yourself
[1:31:32] against yourself that's how this enemy
[1:31:35] is able to do
[1:31:36] to make you hold things against yourself
[1:31:39] or against your brother or to think
[1:31:42] that way when god is thinking that way
[1:31:46] no let us release ourselves
[1:31:49] from the enemy amen we find that every
[1:31:53] time there is a rebuilding and a
[1:31:54] transformation or a renewal
[1:31:56] or a revival of the temple like in
[1:31:58] jerusalem when nehemiah went the revival
[1:32:00] that when they were building the temple
[1:32:02] there was a great turmoil
[1:32:04] there was a great war there was a tough
[1:32:07] time they were fighting
[1:32:08] and building we find that every time
[1:32:11] there is a renewal there is a rebuilding
[1:32:13] there is war we find that it happens
[1:32:16] like that
[1:32:17] we find that today when there is a
[1:32:19] rebuilding of the bride
[1:32:21] there is war there is tough
[1:32:24] time that has been the nature of this
[1:32:27] life
[1:32:28] that has been how god prescribed it and
[1:32:31] it's going to be like that
[1:32:33] that is why if you read these verses of
[1:32:36] overcome those ones that i was reading
[1:32:38] after every one of them the bible says
[1:32:40] he that hath an ear
[1:32:43] let him here and he doesn't say they
[1:32:45] that overcome
[1:32:48] it doesn't say they why it's not a group
[1:32:51] thing
[1:32:53] he that overcome she that overcap
[1:32:58] i'll give him a rope i'll give him a
[1:33:02] stone
[1:33:02] return a name that only him he knows
[1:33:06] he that overcome he or she that overcome
[1:33:12] we are we might be individuals
[1:33:16] but we know we form a body in some other
[1:33:19] parts you're going to see
[1:33:20] as we come to different parts of
[1:33:23] overcoming
[1:33:24] what comes out of overcoming what bri
[1:33:26] what overcoming brings
[1:33:28] or what brings overcoming when you come
[1:33:30] to those stages you will see
[1:33:31] what i'm talking about you'll understand
[1:33:33] that we are a body
[1:33:35] we are a building these stones
[1:33:38] are the ones that are building this
[1:33:40] building
[1:33:43] are we together we also found that
[1:33:46] israel was not always having upper hand
[1:33:49] in most enemies
[1:33:50] or challenges this is why i'm reading
[1:33:53] throughout the bible you can read it
[1:33:55] appeared as if israel is going to lose
[1:33:57] who would have thought that sangha will
[1:33:59] hit all those 600 people
[1:34:02] who would have thought that david will
[1:34:04] hit goliath
[1:34:06] huh who would have thought that joshua
[1:34:08] will just go around the walls
[1:34:10] and then the holes fall now
[1:34:14] it appears as if you are getting
[1:34:17] defeated today
[1:34:18] that's how it looks like agreed is a
[1:34:20] song a great means
[1:34:22] isn't it there's a song that says
[1:34:25] it may look like i'm surrounded but i'm
[1:34:28] surrounded by you
[1:34:30] it may look like the reality is not
[1:34:33] you are not surrounded by the enemy for
[1:34:36] to defeat you
[1:34:37] that's the reality throughout history
[1:34:40] even now
[1:34:41] today the whole world
[1:34:44] is going to be against israel the
[1:34:46] physical israel
[1:34:48] they are going to be against it you see
[1:34:51] but
[1:34:51] what is very good about this whole
[1:34:53] fiasco
[1:34:56] is that every time israel wins overcomes
[1:35:00] amen every time
[1:35:03] israel wins every time
[1:35:07] read the bible you can go read the bible
[1:35:10] you can read history of the inner
[1:35:11] chronicles
[1:35:12] you can read the war you can read every
[1:35:14] time every time israel wins
[1:35:16] yes and you are the spiritual israel you
[1:35:20] every time israel wins israel has got
[1:35:23] the technology that some of the
[1:35:25] countries in the hallway don't have
[1:35:27] where does that come from
[1:35:32] israel as we speak all the borders of
[1:35:35] israel
[1:35:35] are surrounded by his enemies
[1:35:38] you are here in this world you are all
[1:35:41] your borders
[1:35:42] are surrounded yes are you not israel
[1:35:45] today
[1:35:47] you are israel you are surrounded but do
[1:35:50] not worry about who's surrounding you
[1:35:53] the prophet pray that god opens your
[1:35:55] eyes and in 63 he came
[1:35:57] on sunset mountain he revealed
[1:35:59] everything and
[1:36:01] he came and he hold us and you know when
[1:36:04] when
[1:36:04] when a husband hold the wife like that
[1:36:06] and he he took us like this
[1:36:09] huh he took us like this and then we
[1:36:11] marched
[1:36:12] that's what he did in 63 he came and the
[1:36:16] prophet said eliasa
[1:36:17] he married us to him that is why there's
[1:36:20] no fear
[1:36:21] of who is around us jahazi
[1:36:25] realize that oh i'm with the prophet of
[1:36:27] god and these are the angels
[1:36:29] he saw because god opened that i mean
[1:36:32] elijah prayed that god can open his eyes
[1:36:36] today brother brandon prayed that your
[1:36:39] eyes
[1:36:40] can be open for the scripture of
[1:36:42] revelation 10
[1:36:43] 7 has been fulfilled and all eyes
[1:36:47] for the bride are on full alert
[1:36:50] right we also find
[1:36:54] the same thing in life of a believer
[1:36:57] that's what i was trying to tell you
[1:36:59] fight for every inch of the ground
[1:37:00] towards transformation
[1:37:02] there is a battle every corner brother
[1:37:05] every corner my friend so we can't
[1:37:08] expect to say
[1:37:09] what what why why is this thing
[1:37:11] happening to me no
[1:37:13] and he did all those things the lord he
[1:37:15] allowed them
[1:37:16] so that ephesians chapter 5 verse 17 27
[1:37:19] can be fulfilled
[1:37:20] so that he might present to himself a
[1:37:22] glorious church
[1:37:24] not having spot nor wrangle he does not
[1:37:27] want a wrinkle
[1:37:29] i don't want a church with a shirt with
[1:37:31] a wrinkle
[1:37:32] in new zealand sorry
[1:37:35] my colleagues just come with rainbow
[1:37:36] shares they don't care
[1:37:38] they just take your shirt out of the
[1:37:39] basket and wait even
[1:37:41] me i'm getting into that behavior
[1:37:42] nowadays
[1:37:44] because i'm in new zealand you just take
[1:37:46] your shirt and no he didn't go to work
[1:37:52] just i started putting a jay-z
[1:37:55] and i see i just end the caller
[1:37:59] and i see a guy called john proudly
[1:38:01] walking with him
[1:38:02] and wrangle this must be how things
[1:38:06] are done here man
[1:38:08] it's not a problem when you are in rome
[1:38:11] you do what the rumors do but but the
[1:38:13] point i'm trying to say is that
[1:38:15] he wants a straight clean iron church
[1:38:18] without spot
[1:38:20] because he's a spotless god and you
[1:38:23] he has made you you have to believe it
[1:38:25] brothers and sisters friends
[1:38:27] you have to believe it you are without
[1:38:29] spot or wrangle
[1:38:31] if you see any spot and the devil is
[1:38:33] telling you you must know that he's a
[1:38:35] liar
[1:38:36] i told you before i said even if the
[1:38:39] devil can tell you something that is
[1:38:41] he he says to you this mic is standing
[1:38:43] on the pulpit
[1:38:44] he's telling you huh he said this mike
[1:38:48] is on the pulpit
[1:38:49] say devil you are a liar who is he to
[1:38:53] tell you the devil
[1:38:54] only one person you can tell him who are
[1:38:55] you not your brothers not your sisters
[1:38:58] not everyone only the devil
[1:38:59] tell him that devil get deep behind me i
[1:39:02] am the one to tell you this thing is
[1:39:04] sitting on the pulpit not you
[1:39:06] because you are a liar you want to say
[1:39:08] sitting on a mic
[1:39:09] only on a pulpit
[1:39:13] that's how he works be careful of giving
[1:39:15] the devil a
[1:39:16] an ear no hear only the lord
[1:39:21] for he said he that have an ear an ear
[1:39:23] for what
[1:39:24] to hear the word of god not the devil
[1:39:28] the devil is not to be listened to even
[1:39:31] if he speaks the truth
[1:39:32] for he cannot speak the truth he's a
[1:39:35] liar
[1:39:35] and a father of lies that's how the
[1:39:39] devil is and and
[1:39:40] we need to approach him like that with
[1:39:41] no questions with no debates
[1:39:45] now we move to this one i'm finishing
[1:39:48] and over karma is not someone who thinks
[1:39:49] he can
[1:39:50] make it what did i want to say here an
[1:39:54] overcomer is not someone who
[1:39:55] thinks he can't make it sorry
[1:39:58] it's not that i made a mistake there an
[1:40:01] overcomer is not someone who thinks he
[1:40:03] can't make it
[1:40:06] just put there for me please there
[1:40:09] no that's not how an overcomer things an
[1:40:12] overcomer is someone who is fully
[1:40:13] surrendered
[1:40:15] sold out to the lord sold out
[1:40:19] when we say something is sold out we
[1:40:21] mean the stock is finished
[1:40:23] there's no more stock there's no back
[1:40:25] orders to me it's
[1:40:26] it's sold out when when a woman loves
[1:40:32] her husband and she's not
[1:40:35] fully sold out you can see that ah
[1:40:39] even the way he talks to her to him
[1:40:42] huh even the way our sisters must talk
[1:40:45] to their husband right
[1:40:47] isn't it brotherhood where's the gender
[1:40:49] our sisters
[1:40:51] our sister said you must talk to me like
[1:40:53] i'm her husband
[1:40:55] sister christine sister shannon sister
[1:40:58] bruno each one of them all of you ma
[1:41:00] they are my mothers
[1:41:01] i love them like that but they need to
[1:41:03] talk to their husband
[1:41:04] exactly how the bride will talk to jesus
[1:41:09] because the bible says this thing of
[1:41:12] marriage and we marrying our young
[1:41:13] people
[1:41:14] marrying them we are happy he says
[1:41:18] yes we are doing that but it's actually
[1:41:20] it's not it's more about christ and the
[1:41:22] bride
[1:41:24] that's what you should reflect and we
[1:41:27] brothers
[1:41:29] we must love our wives to death
[1:41:33] to be ready to die for them in reality
[1:41:36] to my sister
[1:41:37] that if something comes there i can
[1:41:39] stand and say no no for you to come in
[1:41:41] here
[1:41:42] kill me first before you can go
[1:41:46] in that's how our sisters and our
[1:41:48] brothers
[1:41:49] married should be we shouldn't find but
[1:41:51] sisters say no no no
[1:41:53] no no means me sorry
[1:41:58] n a it means me zulu is mina isn't it
[1:42:01] brother
[1:42:03] you can't find your sister sister
[1:42:04] christian say no no me
[1:42:06] i was even my father i was answering her
[1:42:09] like that
[1:42:11] i was answering him sorry even my dad i
[1:42:13] was answering him like that that's why
[1:42:15] i'm answering my husband like that
[1:42:16] sister we are not talking about your
[1:42:19] father
[1:42:20] no we are not talking about how you were
[1:42:22] brought up
[1:42:24] we are talking about how the bride
[1:42:26] should answer to
[1:42:27] christ that's how a sister answers to
[1:42:32] same with children we'll come to a time
[1:42:35] of children
[1:42:36] it's part of this series if the lord
[1:42:39] give us time we'll talk about it
[1:42:41] the young people see them
[1:42:50] even if they're in canada we talk to
[1:42:53] them with love
[1:42:54] respect i know i'm preaching to the
[1:42:56] converted
[1:42:57] but i'm just reminding you i'm reminding
[1:43:01] you that
[1:43:02] my dad and my mom is still my dad and my
[1:43:05] mom
[1:43:05] even when i'm 90 years old and the
[1:43:08] respect
[1:43:09] there's no respect for zambia respect
[1:43:12] for tanzania
[1:43:14] respect for malawi respect for serbia
[1:43:17] europe american respect
[1:43:20] kiwi respect no respect is respect honor
[1:43:23] your father and your mother amen
[1:43:26] love your husband and respect him talk
[1:43:28] to him like
[1:43:29] like you will answer another husband who
[1:43:32] comes to the house of someone else
[1:43:34] you find a sister talking to another
[1:43:35] husband so nice
[1:43:37] but the husband when we are not there
[1:43:39] come on don't do that i told you
[1:43:41] ah who are you talking to your head
[1:43:45] are you talking to your head
[1:43:48] but you brought them for comes oh god
[1:43:50] please i don't mean you do that i'm just
[1:43:52] warning you
[1:43:53] that those things the bible says they
[1:43:55] must not be found among us
[1:43:57] they must not even be heard among us
[1:44:01] young people who are going to be married
[1:44:03] you have been prepared if they're lord
[1:44:05] terrorists
[1:44:06] young fathers who are going to be
[1:44:07] married you have been prepared
[1:44:10] that's how we talk and respect
[1:44:13] our our spouses
[1:44:17] spouse they're just being refreshed
[1:44:20] isn't this the landing which has been
[1:44:22] refreshed this is also referring to
[1:44:25] me if i can tell you this
[1:44:28] and but i go home and i shout my wife or
[1:44:30] i don't respect her
[1:44:32] i i must not even come here i must sit
[1:44:35] out there
[1:44:35] and repent first
[1:44:40] because the prophet said every minister
[1:44:42] who stands here is going to answer
[1:44:43] before god
[1:44:45] every week that he speaks to the people
[1:44:48] and that's a very risky position to be
[1:44:51] that is why one must be careful
[1:44:53] prayerful before i come here before i
[1:44:55] say yes brother ben
[1:44:57] i must be very careful am i talking to
[1:44:59] the bride of god
[1:45:00] or i'm talking to people that i think
[1:45:02] are my friends do i know who they are if
[1:45:03] i'm asking you
[1:45:04] to know who you are do i know who you
[1:45:06] are
[1:45:07] as a minister preaching that is why i'm
[1:45:10] not just preaching
[1:45:12] is the lord talking to you and to me
[1:45:15] whether i take it or leave it that's the
[1:45:18] bottom line
[1:45:19] and that's how the position is for the
[1:45:20] lord jesus
[1:45:22] it will receive the very elect if it was
[1:45:25] possible
[1:45:26] so close the people so leave people can
[1:45:29] live
[1:45:30] a clean holy life not be sinful
[1:45:33] adulterers drinkers and liars gamblers
[1:45:36] he says people can
[1:45:37] not do those things right
[1:45:40] they live about that and still not with
[1:45:43] it
[1:45:44] what the prophet is saying here is that
[1:45:47] we are not talking about gamblers and
[1:45:49] people can
[1:45:50] can live a better life than me and you
[1:45:52] on the moral side
[1:45:54] and still not have the holy spirit still
[1:45:56] not have the overcoming
[1:45:58] power people can do that people
[1:46:01] can still live do those things better
[1:46:03] than me and you
[1:46:05] and i still haven't overcome him still
[1:46:06] not having overcoming so
[1:46:08] it is about the life of christ
[1:46:11] in red there this is the age of life
[1:46:14] personal life of christ personal
[1:46:18] life of christ in other words i should
[1:46:20] live today
[1:46:22] the way christ will live had he been
[1:46:24] here on the earth
[1:46:26] physically when he was here physically
[1:46:31] when he was here physically he gave
[1:46:34] everything
[1:46:35] they said it was so simple to a point
[1:46:37] that if he was among us here you could
[1:46:39] not even know him
[1:46:43] that's how the lord was may god help us
[1:46:50] maybe i should stop here so that we can
[1:46:52] come and continue
[1:46:54] next time you must know who
[1:46:57] what why how to overcome and those will
[1:47:00] be the parts of some of the areas that
[1:47:02] will tackle as we go on
[1:47:03] next time very very new
[1:47:06] put your focus concentration efforts on
[1:47:09] the right things
[1:47:09] all the time your efforts your
[1:47:12] concentration everything that you make
[1:47:13] an effort for
[1:47:15] in your life get approval of the lord
[1:47:18] does the lord want me to wear this or
[1:47:21] does the lord want me to buy this car
[1:47:26] does the lord want me to buy this suit
[1:47:29] is it the will of the lord for me to do
[1:47:34] this
[1:47:38] by this i mean both sides when i'm
[1:47:40] talking about this
[1:47:41] putting focus concentration efforts on
[1:47:43] the right things
[1:47:44] what i mean by that is that when it
[1:47:46] comes to god and his children
[1:47:48] let all the glory be to god
[1:47:52] don't you find people who want to be
[1:47:53] pompous people who wants to be known
[1:47:55] and i've said this before people who
[1:47:58] putting
[1:47:59] respect and i'm not saying we mustn't
[1:48:00] respect one another but we mustn't
[1:48:02] over elevate each other and we mustn't
[1:48:05] under elevate each other
[1:48:07] there should be just a walk in the
[1:48:09] middle of the road when when we tend to
[1:48:11] be
[1:48:11] men pleasers and also proud ourselves
[1:48:16] those are the settings that the devil
[1:48:18] puts on earth and he makes them our
[1:48:20] habits
[1:48:20] and he makes them as if we own them
[1:48:25] and we fail to realize that those things
[1:48:26] are not ours
[1:48:29] when it comes to the devil and all his
[1:48:31] works learn how to separate and
[1:48:33] distinguish between your brother and the
[1:48:35] devil
[1:48:36] must be you must be have that wisdom
[1:48:38] that tells her no
[1:48:40] it's not your brother talking like that
[1:48:41] it's the devil
[1:48:43] it happened in the bible the lord jesus
[1:48:45] said get be behind me satan
[1:48:48] do you think he was talking to peter
[1:48:51] he was not he knew how to separate
[1:48:55] between satan and the devil i must know
[1:48:59] when i interact with a believer that if
[1:49:01] my brother there he was a bit stumbled
[1:49:04] and had a big circle to incorporate him
[1:49:08] amen so
[1:49:11] otherwise it was going to be a problem
[1:49:12] for joshua he wouldn't have known
[1:49:14] that captain and he checked who are you
[1:49:19] and he said i'm the captain of the house
[1:49:21] and he knew
[1:49:23] so you must always check who are you
[1:49:28] what are you doing what is this why is
[1:49:30] this thought coming to my mind
[1:49:33] question it amen
[1:49:36] so that's how we need to do as believers
[1:49:41] we found that god always had overcomers
[1:49:44] but each one of those
[1:49:45] special had a special work and this is
[1:49:47] now the basis of
[1:49:49] how what i'm going to talk later on when
[1:49:51] you talk about the building
[1:49:52] when you talk about you as the stones of
[1:49:55] this great
[1:49:56] building is those overcomers in the
[1:49:58] bible
[1:49:59] noah abraham joshua david esther rude
[1:50:02] hannah
[1:50:03] nehemiah paul the list goes on and on
[1:50:06] and on
[1:50:07] why because each one of them was a stone
[1:50:10] in this temple
[1:50:12] each one of you is a stone and i don't
[1:50:15] expect the stones
[1:50:16] you see the stones here they are not the
[1:50:19] same
[1:50:21] they may look with a pattern they may
[1:50:24] look
[1:50:24] nice but each one of these stones is
[1:50:27] unique if i take this one and put it
[1:50:29] here
[1:50:30] and take this and put it it can't sit
[1:50:32] they have been made for that spot
[1:50:35] serpent and corner for each one this one
[1:50:39] small one here that you can't even see
[1:50:40] or this one it can't sit here
[1:50:44] yeah and this is me and you
[1:50:48] and you know what we are precious stones
[1:50:52] specially cut all we need to do
[1:50:56] is the lord to find a spot for us where
[1:50:58] we sit in that great building
[1:51:00] and you sit there you know you don't
[1:51:02] even need water
[1:51:04] you don't even need mortar because even
[1:51:06] the thinnest blade
[1:51:08] can go between those stones here
[1:51:11] because it's not a perfect building i i
[1:51:14] i can't even put glue there it can go
[1:51:17] but with this perfect building of god
[1:51:20] some stones we'll talk about them sepha
[1:51:24] onix all those beautiful stones
[1:51:27] you know gold
[1:51:30] by the way we will be working on gold us
[1:51:32] in heaven
[1:51:34] us will be working on our streets will
[1:51:36] be gold i don't know about the
[1:51:38] the lions what will they be used but the
[1:51:40] streets
[1:51:41] will be working on gold see this thing
[1:51:44] looks like gold
[1:51:45] it's not even gold but we will be
[1:51:48] working on gold
[1:51:49] a road made of gold we'll be working on
[1:51:51] it
[1:51:53] just think about that because you're
[1:51:56] called with a high
[1:51:57] calling let me conclude there
[1:52:01] that you are an overcomer this will be
[1:52:03] the fruits
[1:52:05] power to surrender the power to love
[1:52:08] power to fellowship
[1:52:09] the power to create an atmosphere the
[1:52:11] power to forgive
[1:52:12] the power to know yourself the power the
[1:52:15] power the power
[1:52:16] the power this is the power that we are
[1:52:18] talking about
[1:52:19] and this will be expanded as we go along
[1:52:22] at least you can go home and make a long
[1:52:24] list backer
[1:52:25] about this power amen and then we will
[1:52:30] finish off
[1:52:30] by reading ephesians chapter four
[1:52:34] till we all come in unity of the faith
[1:52:37] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:52:39] unto a perfect
[1:52:42] man
[1:52:44] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:52:46] fullness of christ
[1:52:49] until we get there that we henceforth
[1:52:53] be normal children toast to and from
[1:52:59] and carried about with every wind of
[1:53:02] doctrine
[1:53:03] with every wind of talk with every
[1:53:06] thought let's talk about you as an
[1:53:07] individual
[1:53:08] with every thought every activity every
[1:53:12] action
[1:53:13] creates a reaction from you no
[1:53:18] let's not talk about the church let's
[1:53:20] talk about me as an individual
[1:53:22] that everything causes me to say ah
[1:53:25] i thought he loves me maybe he does not
[1:53:26] love me everything even if my brother is
[1:53:29] just coughing
[1:53:30] so maybe he doesn't like me that brother
[1:53:35] am i not being a child being tossed and
[1:53:37] fro yeah yeah we shouldn't be there
[1:53:41] we should be mature tester we should be
[1:53:43] to a point where
[1:53:44] when my brother comes i say yes god
[1:53:46] bless you my brother
[1:53:47] you are just coughing you are not
[1:53:49] referring to me
[1:53:52] if you are referring to me already in my
[1:53:53] heart i forgive you
[1:53:55] a child of god is someone who works on
[1:53:57] autopilot
[1:54:00] a child of god is even better than this
[1:54:02] cast that you drive an auto they are not
[1:54:04] auto

[1:57:43] verse
[1:57:45] how many wants me to read those three
[1:57:47] verses then we are finished
[1:57:49] can i read it can i thank you so much
[1:57:54] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:57:56] tossed to and fro
[1:57:58] and carried about with every wind of
[1:58:01] doctrine
[1:58:03] and a false doctrine it's not just what
[1:58:05] they stand there and preaching and
[1:58:07] no no efforts that think the enemy can
[1:58:09] bring it to you
[1:58:10] a wrong thought a wrong action around
[1:58:13] any action anything
[1:58:15] resembles the doctrine of the devil
[1:58:17] because
[1:58:18] you if you do it which means you believe
[1:58:21] the wrong doctrine
[1:58:23] of the devil a lie of the devil
[1:58:26] by by the slight of men
[1:58:29] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:58:33] in wait to deceive but speaking you
[1:58:37] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:58:40] up
[1:58:41] into him in all things
[1:58:44] which is the head even christ
[1:58:47] so you are very important people i'm not
[1:58:50] joking
[1:58:50] that's why i'm not mincing my weight you
[1:58:53] are very
[1:58:54] important people who are
[1:58:57] powerless but yet very important the
[1:59:02] lord was so important he was so powerful
[1:59:04] to a point where when they were busy
[1:59:06] doing all those things he said forgive
[1:59:08] them
[1:59:10] that's that's why we need to come even
[1:59:13] christ verse 16 from whom the whole body
[1:59:17] fitly joined together and compacted
[1:59:21] you know what is compacting brother
[1:59:23] benny you are in construction
[1:59:25] when we compact something you know you
[1:59:28] compact it
[1:59:29] we use a competitor the whole day
[1:59:35] even when you go to bed you are still
[1:59:37] cheating it's compacted
[1:59:41] this road that they made yeah they use a
[1:59:43] competitor
[1:59:45] jointly fitted competitor that this road
[1:59:48] can last a hundred years
[1:59:50] they can make those rules how much more
[1:59:54] a believer the love that this body is
[1:59:57] gently
[1:59:58] fitted together and compacted
[2:00:03] i would like to see the competitor of
[2:00:04] the lord
[2:00:06] how how how we are so gently
[2:00:09] fitted into others so compacted we will
[2:00:12] be
[2:00:13] that no piece of devil can come in
[2:00:15] between
[2:00:16] that's what he's talking about there
[2:00:18] that's what he's talking about there
[2:00:20] compacted by that which every joint
[2:00:23] supplies you know when things are not
[2:00:25] joined and compacted
[2:00:27] this joint is trying to supply this one
[2:00:28] but because this one is not compacted
[2:00:30] there's a leak here because there's no
[2:00:32] compaction
[2:00:34] it's not joined are we laughing each
[2:00:38] other so much that brother ben can chew
[2:00:41] a chun gum over the marion
[2:00:43] or brother john and then give it to me
[2:00:45] and i chew it
[2:00:47] [Laughter]
[2:00:49] are we loving each other that much
[2:00:56] spiritually yes spiritually yes
[2:01:01] spiritually we must love each other to
[2:01:04] be ready to die
[2:01:05] for one another no more just your
[2:01:07] husband your children know
[2:01:09] your brothers and sisters to die you are
[2:01:11] so compacted
[2:01:13] that even when we are sleeping you know
[2:01:17] we are so compacted by that which is
[2:01:20] if every joint suppliers according to
[2:01:23] the
[2:01:23] effectual working in the measure of
[2:01:26] every part
[2:01:28] it's a strong language man now i've
[2:01:30] never had english like this
[2:01:31] there's no way you can go and check all
[2:01:33] the philosophy
[2:01:34] all the philanthropy all the books
[2:01:37] philosophical
[2:01:38] you can't find a language like this this
[2:01:41] evening a theologian can't understand
[2:01:43] they have to go and be taught how to
[2:01:45] become a professor and still not
[2:01:47] understand it
[2:01:48] because this comes from the university
[2:01:50] of hallelujah
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:54] this is come this comes from the faculty
[2:01:57] of jaira
[2:02:00] the school of heaven that's where it
[2:02:02] comes from
[2:02:04] ah even a professor can't understand
[2:02:06] this
[2:02:07] of theology i mean if i say
[2:02:12] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[2:02:14] together and compacted
[2:02:15] by that which every joint supplies
[2:02:17] according to the effectual working
[2:02:19] in the measure of every part make an
[2:02:21] increase of the body and to the edifying
[2:02:24] of itself in love the prophet says huh
[2:02:29] the prophet can't get it but you you
[2:02:32] already get excited
[2:02:34] because you you know the language the
[2:02:36] language talks to you
[2:02:42] let's turn on our feet can you stand
[2:02:55] i would like each one of us to think
[2:02:57] about
[2:02:58] this overcoming power we're just laying
[2:03:02] the foundation that maybe one day if the
[2:03:05] lord
[2:03:06] is willing we can expand the thought
[2:03:09] further
[2:03:10] and see other areas of this overcoming
[2:03:13] power
[2:03:14] that does not come by might or by our
[2:03:16] own power
[2:03:18] or by any national power or by any human
[2:03:21] power but this overcoming our power
[2:03:25] this overcoming power that is inside you
[2:03:29] the overcoming power is the reality
[2:03:33] of who you are today that's the
[2:03:36] overcoming power we are talking about
[2:03:38] and you have it and the devil wants to
[2:03:40] make it a shallow thing
[2:03:43] and that cannot be allowed that cannot
[2:03:46] be accepted
[2:03:47] not in this lifetime not in the life to
[2:03:49] come
[2:03:51] you have to defeat the devil everywhere
[2:03:54] on air on the road on the ground
[2:03:59] in the sea everywhere he must be
[2:04:01] defeated
[2:04:03] dead or alive that's how the devil must
[2:04:06] be defeated
[2:04:07] amen so we are going to take this with
[2:04:11] us think about this overcoming power
[2:04:16] think about it coming becoming a reality
[2:04:18] daily
[2:04:19] you as an individual you as a person
[2:04:24] why we need to think like that
[2:04:27] the spirit of god must find a freedom
[2:04:30] for the gifts that were promised to us
[2:04:33] and to this church and to the churches
[2:04:36] of the living god they must come to pass
[2:04:39] brothers and sisters
[2:04:40] why am i talking like this because time
[2:04:42] is no more
[2:04:44] we now are not be supposed to be
[2:04:47] still on the abc's no
[2:04:51] we are not supposed to we are supposed
[2:04:52] to have gone past an unbelievable stage
[2:04:54] and make deliver stage we are supposed
[2:04:56] to pass
[2:05:00] so that we can brother andy can come
[2:05:02] here and teach us and tell us
[2:05:04] how our heart is jerusalem
[2:05:07] and that temple is being rebuilt today
[2:05:10] those are the teachings that we need
[2:05:12] that's the real message
[2:05:15] of the deadpool those are the things
[2:05:19] right we we want to move to a time when
[2:05:22] the preacher finished preaching
[2:05:24] and there's prayer and worship praise
[2:05:26] and worship that a prophecy comes
[2:05:28] and say brother sorry and so go and make
[2:05:31] right about this and this and this
[2:05:33] that said the lord you will be healed
[2:05:36] that's what we want that's what we want
[2:05:41] we want the times to come where the the
[2:05:44] gifts will come
[2:05:45] to grief that will be operating among us
[2:05:49] as promised remember
[2:05:52] this church was promised
[2:05:56] so a prom god never promised and not
[2:05:59] fulfill
[2:06:00] he promises and he fulfills and he will
[2:06:03] fulfill
[2:06:04] keep on confessing and the prophet says
[2:06:07] keep on confessing it
[2:06:09] it shall come to pass to you to your
[2:06:12] children
[2:06:13] and to everyone that you love that said
[2:06:15] the lord
[2:06:16] everything that you love i'll give it to
[2:06:18] you
[2:06:22] because he knows that you cannot love
[2:06:24] the wrong things
[2:06:26] he knows amen i would like each one
[2:06:30] who wants this overcoming power
[2:06:33] fully let's be reverend before god
[2:06:37] we are going to pray together but i
[2:06:39] believe
[2:06:40] that the little ways that are spoken
[2:06:42] here the lord will re-preach them
[2:06:44] and you will regurgitate them and the
[2:06:46] lord will place them
[2:06:48] properly in your heart as we close our
[2:06:51] eyes maybe musicians should come
[2:06:53] and just softly lead us into this prayer
[2:06:56] we are going to lift up our hands
[2:06:58] and god is going to answer because god
[2:07:00] knows
[2:07:01] your need god knows your desire
[2:07:05] god knows what you want
[2:07:10] and what you need and the lord is able
[2:07:13] enough

[2:07:44] nothing
[2:07:45] as we are bowing our eyes our heads and
[2:07:48] closing our eyes before god
