[41:19] go to
[41:19] first kings 18 and then we're going to
[41:22] go to exodus 30 and i pray this kind of
[41:24] just all
[41:24] all ties together
[41:28] uh first kings 18 and um
[41:32] we're going to go from verse 17.
[41:33] probably a
[41:35] quite a familiar piece of scripture i
[41:37] trust everyone
[41:42] you know we were driving where did we go
[41:44] we're going to go get us the 18
[41:46] happy birthday 18 year old sash for
[41:48] tiana yesterday
[41:50] and armando ed asked me what's the title
[41:52] of your sermon and i said i'm not sure
[41:54] yet
[41:54] they said why not i thought boy that's a
[41:57] message of the vital so i kind of
[41:58] incorporated this
[41:59] but yeah we'll see how we go but you
[42:01] know
[42:02] we should be sure god is god amen so
[42:06] first kings 18 and from verse 17
[42:10] down to verse 24 and it came to pass
[42:12] when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto
[42:15] him
[42:16] art thou he that troubleth israel and he
[42:19] answered
[42:19] i have not troubled israel but thou in
[42:22] thy father's house and that ye
[42:24] have forsaken the commandments of the
[42:26] lord and has not and has followed
[42:29] balaam now therefore send and gather to
[42:32] me all israel unto mount carmel
[42:34] and the prophets of baal 450 and the
[42:37] prophets of the groves 400
[42:39] which eat at jezebel's table so ahab
[42:42] sent unto all the children of israel and
[42:44] gathered the prophets together unto
[42:45] mount carmel
[42:46] and elijah came unto all and came unto
[42:49] all the people
[42:50] and said how long holt here between two
[42:53] opinions
[42:54] if the lord be god follow him but if
[42:57] baal then follow him
[42:59] and the people answered him not a word
[43:01] then said elijah unto the people i even
[43:04] i
[43:04] only remain a prophet of the lord but
[43:07] balaam's prophets are 450 men
[43:10] let them therefore give us two bullocks
[43:13] let them choose one bullet for
[43:14] themselves and cut it in pieces lay it
[43:16] on wood
[43:17] and put no fire under it and i'll dress
[43:19] the other bullock and lay it on wood and
[43:20] put no fire under it
[43:22] and call you on the name of your gods
[43:24] and i'll call on the name of the lord
[43:26] and the god that answereth by fire let
[43:28] him be god
[43:30] and all the people answered and said it
[43:32] is well spoken
[43:34] they weren't sure but why not amen
[43:38] well we're going to go to exodus uh
[43:39] chapter 30
[43:41] and we're going to read from verse 11
[43:45] here um uh
[43:48] uh chapter 30 and from from verse 11 of
[43:51] of exodus
[43:57] i'm glad people ask because that means
[43:59] they want to know especially just people
[44:01] going you're just you know
[44:02] not listening or not wanting so i'm yeah
[44:04] praise the lord i'm glad
[44:06] i'm in a company of people who we all
[44:07] want more of god don't we
[44:09] in our lives amen so exodus 30 and verse
[44:12] 11 and the lord spake
[44:14] unto moses saying when thou take us to
[44:17] some of the children of israel after
[44:19] their number
[44:20] then shall they give every man a ransom
[44:22] for his soul unto the lord
[44:24] when thou numbers them that there be no
[44:26] plague among them
[44:27] when thou numbers them this shall they
[44:30] give
[44:31] everyone that passeth among them that
[44:33] are numbered half a shekel after the
[44:35] shekel of the sanctuary
[44:37] a shekel is 20 gunas and
[44:41] and half shekel shall be the offering of
[44:42] the lord everyone that passes among them
[44:45] that are numbered from 20 years old and
[44:47] above shall give an offering unto the
[44:49] lord
[44:50] the rich shall not give more and the
[44:52] poor shall not give less
[44:54] than half a shekel when they give an
[44:56] offering unto the lord to make in a tall
[44:58] atonement for your souls
[45:03] so this price that was paid was tied
[45:05] into their atonement
[45:07] i mean let's just bow heads in a word of
[45:08] prayer this morning if you have a need
[45:10] you'll lift it to the lord
[45:12] amen let's yo he's a personal god
[45:15] so let's talk to him let's let's come
[45:17] before him and ask him to
[45:19] come to where we are this morning
[45:20] gracious heavenly father
[45:22] lord we are so thankful that nothing
[45:24] compares to the promise we have in you
[45:26] you're the great almighty god you're the
[45:28] creator of heavens and earth and lord
[45:30] you
[45:30] fill all time and space but yet lord you
[45:33] became the lowest of the low
[45:35] oh lord you became the poorest of the
[45:37] poor lord you took on human battles you
[45:40] took on human frailty
[45:41] to understand what was like to be a to
[45:44] be a human
[45:45] but also to ransom us to redeem us back
[45:47] to yourself so
[45:48] i just want to pray lord may you receive
[45:50] all honor glory and praise lord
[45:52] oh i wish we had more words to express
[45:54] our love and our thanksgiving unto you
[45:56] lord what you've done for us
[45:58] dear god i pray you just meet every need
[46:00] this morning may touch every life anoint
[46:02] every soul
[46:03] lord maybe walk out of these doors
[46:05] changed transformed and renewed lord by
[46:07] your presence lord
[46:08] may you grant it lord we've read just
[46:10] from the pages of your word we're just
[46:12] asking once again may you the great
[46:13] author come and make it live
[46:15] lord in our lives grant it for your
[46:17] glory we just want to
[46:19] lift up those who are sick and body who
[46:21] are not here be their portion
[46:22] lord we especially want to remember
[46:24] dimitri down in christchurch at this
[46:25] time lord i pray you touch his body and
[46:28] lord may he use this sickness to bring
[46:29] his heart back to you lord for your
[46:31] glory
[46:31] lord for the salvation of the family may
[46:33] you grant it lord we commit them into
[46:35] your hands
[46:36] we thank you lord any other needs lord
[46:38] may you meet them for your glory we love
[46:40] you and just want to commit the service
[46:41] into your hands
[46:42] in jesus christ's name amen amen god
[46:45] bless you friends you may have your
[46:46] seeds this morning so
[46:48] as i said i want to speak on i'm not
[46:50] sure yet and then the answer question
[46:52] should be why not
[46:53] you know people may say that they are
[46:55] believers
[46:57] but their lives show they're not sure
[46:59] yet we should be real
[47:00] sure you know as as abraham would come
[47:04] to a spot he became fully persuaded
[47:07] that the lord was more than able to to
[47:09] give him the promised son
[47:10] so he wasn't sure he was real sure he
[47:13] was fully persuaded now
[47:14] when he was fully persuaded he wasn't
[47:16] talked into it
[47:17] because if someone can talk you into the
[47:19] message someone can talk you
[47:21] out of the message but if the lord
[47:23] reveals it to you you become fully
[47:24] persuaded
[47:25] that no one can talk you out of it
[47:27] because it was the lord that brought you
[47:28] in
[47:29] and if the lord brought you in man
[47:30] cannot take you out i mean so
[47:32] it's amazing when you think of what god
[47:34] would
[47:35] you know had done during the you know
[47:37] you know in the history of israel
[47:39] but they came to a spot where they
[47:41] forgot really the mighty power of god
[47:43] you know i'm so thankful that you know
[47:45] um
[47:46] you know that god still answers though
[47:48] you know because he wants every
[47:50] generation to have their own revival
[47:52] he wants every generation every
[47:53] generation has a chance at the word
[47:55] that the world would put on flesh in
[47:57] their lives and live every generation
[47:59] does
[48:00] not just the older generation not just
[48:02] our grandparents generation but
[48:04] our generation and when i say our
[48:06] generation i say every man woman and
[48:08] child
[48:08] in this building this generation but
[48:11] elijah
[48:12] you know god had to call them to what we
[48:15] call a mount carmel showdown in order to
[48:17] reveal himself and you know what happens
[48:20] is when people are between two opinions
[48:22] is it it
[48:22] actually produces spiritual amnesia the
[48:24] prophet tells us
[48:25] that people actually forget who they are
[48:27] when they're between two opinions you
[48:29] know
[48:29] it's always the opinion is jesus christ
[48:32] the same yesterday today and forever is
[48:33] he not
[48:34] you know is this mess is true or is it
[48:36] not well i've heard this person say this
[48:38] i've heard this person say this
[48:39] and being between those two opinions
[48:41] causes a person to forget
[48:43] who they are but elijah wasn't in that
[48:46] state the rest of israel may have been
[48:47] we know there were seven thousand who
[48:49] had not
[48:49] bowed you know you know bowed down to
[48:51] baal but you know elijah was fully
[48:53] persuaded
[48:54] that god was god but the thing is you
[48:57] know whenever you meet the lord you
[48:58] can't keep it to yourself
[49:00] you've got to tell us you want other
[49:02] people to become fully persuaded
[49:03] you don't want them to be not sure yet
[49:05] you want them to be sure
[49:06] that god is god amen so he called them
[49:08] to mount carmel
[49:10] and he said why staggy between two
[49:12] opinions if god is really god give all
[49:14] you are to him
[49:16] serve him with all your energy all your
[49:18] strength all of your love all of your
[49:20] affection should be poured upon him
[49:21] he's worth it all if baal is god give
[49:24] him all your love all your affection all
[49:26] that you are
[49:27] serve him but make up your mind that's
[49:29] what you got to do as well make up your
[49:31] mind
[49:32] as god god was baal god which one's god
[49:35] find out who is god
[49:36] and serve that god hallelujah and then
[49:38] he said you know what i love he says now
[49:40] the real god will answer by fire now
[49:43] baal baal was the god of fire they
[49:46] believed
[49:47] he was the god of the rain and it was
[49:48] head of drought one man said
[49:51] there will be no rain or due till i call
[49:52] for it hallelujah and it didn't there
[49:55] was no reign of jew until he called for
[49:56] it
[49:57] amen so he was a god of of rain and
[50:00] there was no rain
[50:01] and they believed he was god of fire so
[50:04] they believed well
[50:05] fire's gonna fall we're gonna fix this
[50:06] problem they were the problem
[50:08] by being between two opinions they were
[50:10] the problem amen but god is the answer
[50:13] to every problem
[50:15] hallelujah so so here they were and he
[50:18] said the god that answers by
[50:20] fire he is god hallelujah and we know
[50:22] the rest of the story
[50:23] the offering was prepared he rebuilt the
[50:26] altar of the lord
[50:27] you know we should just be you know we
[50:28] have so many testimonies in our midst
[50:31] who's been saved stand up have you been
[50:33] saved
[50:34] stand up if you've got the holy ghost
[50:36] standing have you been healed
[50:38] look around everyone there's a lot of
[50:40] testimony right here if god is god
[50:42] serve him holy we've seen his god alive
[50:45] today
[50:46] not yesterday not someone else's story
[50:48] i'm so glad everyone who's standing you
[50:50] can say
[50:50] it's not my neighbor's story that
[50:52] brought me in god brought me in
[50:54] god save me god redeem me tell this if
[50:56] god is god serve him hallelujah
[50:59] amen and i can say god you could may
[51:01] have your seats if you so desire
[51:02] but you know we just it's got to take
[51:05] stock
[51:06] sometimes is god alive does this message
[51:09] produce jesus christ and the people
[51:11] is the word put on flesh again it has
[51:14] amen it's a living god
[51:16] it's not a historical god amen jesus
[51:18] christ is alive today
[51:19] why are you trying to drill these things
[51:21] because you know everything god was he
[51:23] poured into you
[51:24] all there wasn't god has poured into
[51:26] christ all those important and the
[51:27] christ is poured into you
[51:29] hallelujah so we have we have everything
[51:32] we have need of
[51:33] we have glory we don't need to go get it
[51:36] it's here
[51:37] hallelujah amen you know brother brown
[51:40] would say
[51:42] um if i can find it here
[51:46] he says the reason
[51:50] he says in the prince of god
[51:51] unrecognized he said but what happened
[51:54] this little woman had an issue of blood
[51:56] and she heard about him and when she
[51:58] come down there regardless of what
[52:00] anybody said she recognized who he was
[52:03] and she said if i can only touch his
[52:05] garmency
[52:06] and when that genuine faith in god
[52:08] became a positive thing to her
[52:10] what did it release it released his
[52:12] power to heal her
[52:13] it touched him in such a way he turned
[52:16] around
[52:17] and told her what was wrong with her uh
[52:20] your faith has saved you what did faith
[52:23] other
[52:24] other standing there might have been
[52:26] sicker than she but you see she
[52:28] recognizes presence
[52:30] she knowed that was her opportunity if
[52:33] we could only do that tonight i'll say
[52:35] this morning people if we could only
[52:38] realize
[52:39] that he's appearing to us in these
[52:41] meetings for one purpose
[52:43] that's to release our desires that we
[52:45] have in him to us
[52:47] but we've got to recognize his presence
[52:50] and now
[52:50] how how do you recognize his presence is
[52:53] when
[52:54] the promised word of this age is made
[52:56] manifest
[52:57] hallelujah and you know not the promised
[53:00] word of moses age or any other ages the
[53:02] promised word
[53:03] of this age now we know very you know
[53:06] it's beyond a shadow of a doubt
[53:08] the lord's restored all things the books
[53:10] come open the mighty angel has descended
[53:12] amen we've received malachi 4.
[53:15] hallelujah revelations 10 7
[53:16] the son of man has been revealed in our
[53:19] midst today
[53:20] i mean in a body of people highly so
[53:23] that is the promised word of today
[53:25] i mean so we we are here you know you
[53:28] know i believe that we're in another
[53:29] season
[53:30] where god's pouring his spirit out more
[53:32] and more hallelujah
[53:33] because he wants to prepare us for a
[53:35] rapture i mean where the dynamics comes
[53:38] into full manifestation the moving of
[53:40] his holy ghost comes into its full power
[53:42] once again hallelujah so i believe
[53:44] that's where we are living right now but
[53:46] the reason he's moving
[53:47] i mean it's because he wants to release
[53:49] to us our desires that we have in him
[53:52] i mean so we have a desire for the holy
[53:54] ghost we have a desire for more of god
[53:55] desire for healing desire for
[53:57] deliverance
[53:58] desire for salvation of our families or
[54:00] ourselves well he's moving because he
[54:02] wants to release that desire to us
[54:04] hallelujah that's why it's so important
[54:06] to reach out and touch the lord as he
[54:08] passes by
[54:09] i mean don't take it for granted we're
[54:10] just having church again thank god we're
[54:12] having church again
[54:13] thank god we're not in some lockdown
[54:14] where we can't gather no more and we're
[54:16] just looking over a screen and
[54:18] you know there's some countries in the
[54:19] world they're still in lockdown
[54:22] they're still in lockdown for over a
[54:23] year now they can't gather like this
[54:25] they can't have camp they can't have
[54:27] church like this
[54:28] but we can hallelujah
[54:31] amen so we should never take it for
[54:33] granted hallelujah so elijah made the
[54:36] challenge but the reason he made the
[54:37] challenge
[54:38] is god told him go make the challenge
[54:40] hardly because he knew because when he
[54:42] prayed after the wood was
[54:43] prepared the altar was prepared the
[54:45] sacrifice all the water on and
[54:46] everything
[54:47] he says lord i have done this all
[54:49] according to your word
[54:51] so the lord already showed him what to
[54:52] do he wasn't guessing when he stood up
[54:54] there and made the challenge
[54:55] god already told him by vision go do
[54:57] this and he saw the vision unfold
[54:59] hallelujah and then he called said lord
[55:03] that you that the people know that thou
[55:05] art god and now has turned their hearts
[55:07] back again
[55:08] other than the fire fell hallelujah and
[55:11] then the people's amnesia was broken
[55:12] they realized the lord he is god
[55:14] has not balaam and what these priests
[55:16] have been telling us in their arguments
[55:18] they're debating their political
[55:19] pressure that they use
[55:20] but they realize that the god that's
[55:22] answered by fire he's a true and living
[55:24] god
[55:24] hallelujah and they gave themselves back
[55:26] to that god
[55:28] hallelujah so you know we could just
[55:30] look at it as a
[55:31] you know ask you all just well stand up
[55:33] if you've got a testimony well
[55:35] these people are sure you may say i'm
[55:38] not sure yet well why not
[55:40] god's done too much that may be a wrong
[55:43] way to say it but he's gone he's done so
[55:45] much
[55:46] he's he's done so much in this
[55:48] generation i'm not talking about even
[55:50] when brother brown was i'm talking about
[55:51] right now
[55:52] he has done so much proved himself alive
[55:55] hallelujah
[55:55] by many many infallible or uninfallible
[55:59] proofs or however you say it you know i
[56:00] say things around the wrong way half the
[56:01] time but you know what i mean
[56:03] amen amen now we should be real
[56:06] sure that he is the our our redeemer
[56:11] now we read that scripture in
[56:14] exodus 30 because there was a reason
[56:16] when jesus went into the temple
[56:19] he got angry at the at the money changes
[56:22] and those that sell the sold the
[56:24] sacrifices
[56:26] now when it speaks we read here that
[56:28] there would be a um
[56:29] they had to pay a redemption money and
[56:32] it had to be half a shekel
[56:34] after the shekel of the sanctuary so
[56:37] what had to happen is as you know
[56:38] you know a shekel was a weight of of of
[56:41] of money
[56:42] and different countries had a different
[56:44] shekel so the syrians would have their
[56:45] own shekel egypt would have a shekel
[56:47] it's like a dollar there's australian
[56:49] dollar new zealand dollar american
[56:51] dollar
[56:52] you know whatever but you have to when
[56:54] you go to that certain country you have
[56:56] to get your money traded
[56:57] or swapped to use that money in the
[56:59] country
[57:00] i could have a million or a billion us
[57:02] dollars but it had to be changed into
[57:04] new zealand dollars to be used here
[57:06] right or if i go there advice you know
[57:08] anyway so this the shekel of the
[57:11] sanctuary
[57:12] what would happen is people would travel
[57:14] with shekels from another country but in
[57:16] order to
[57:17] pay this for the atonement for their
[57:19] soul they had to get their money
[57:20] exchanged
[57:21] otherwise they couldn't use their money
[57:23] in the temple
[57:25] so there had to be a currency that was
[57:27] there that the people could use
[57:29] in order to pay this atonement for their
[57:32] soul
[57:33] now we know all these things point to
[57:36] our lord jesus christ
[57:37] right there is a you know this god would
[57:39] show these things in shadow
[57:41] revealing you know our redemption to us
[57:45] because this would be in it this this
[57:47] money even though the blood was given
[57:48] all those different things they had to
[57:50] make this
[57:51] pay this pay this uh price
[57:54] in order to make an atonement for their
[57:56] souls now
[57:57] we know when jesus was standing on the
[57:59] earth
[58:00] they challenged him and they asked him
[58:02] tell us therefore who think
[58:04] what thinkest thou is it lawful to give
[58:07] tribute unto caesar or not
[58:09] and jesus it says perceive their
[58:12] wickedness and said why attempt ye
[58:14] me ye hypocrites and then he got given a
[58:17] piece of tribute money
[58:19] and he held it up and said whose
[58:22] inscription is on this whose image is on
[58:24] this coin
[58:25] and they could easily identify caesar's
[58:27] inscription on the coin
[58:28] but here was the image of the invisible
[58:30] god made flesh among them
[58:32] here was you could say the shekel of the
[58:34] sanctuary
[58:35] was standing in flesh not just for one
[58:38] person but for the people of the whole
[58:39] earth
[58:40] and they could easily identify the
[58:41] man-made shekel but what about the
[58:43] god-made shekel
[58:45] what about what about the tribute money
[58:47] or the or the or the shekel of the
[58:48] sanctuary that was made flesh the real
[58:50] one
[58:50] what the shadow was pointing to was now
[58:52] reality they couldn't see
[58:54] past the veil they couldn't they you see
[58:56] many times we've got to look past one
[58:58] another
[58:59] and see the word well look past our
[59:01] humanity look past our faults or you
[59:03] know our
[59:04] our sticky nature will look past those
[59:06] things and see god made flesh
[59:09] i mean so they couldn't you know it took
[59:11] god
[59:12] supernaturally to reveal to peter james
[59:15] and john this was more than a man from
[59:16] galilee a more a man from nazareth than
[59:19] more than a prophet more than a good
[59:21] person more than a philosopher this was
[59:22] god
[59:24] hallelujah so so the scribes and
[59:26] pharisees could easily identify the
[59:28] money but they couldn't identify the one
[59:30] who could actually redeem them
[59:32] oh my lord jesus i pray that we can look
[59:35] beyond
[59:36] oh it's just ink on paper is it
[59:39] oh it's just a message is it really it's
[59:41] just sermons is it really or is it just
[59:43] a prophet's ministry is it is it only
[59:45] that
[59:46] or is it god revealed in this hour oh
[59:49] we're just having church are we really
[59:50] just having church what does that mean
[59:52] oh we're just here on a sunday morning
[59:54] because this is what we do is it is it
[59:55] really that
[59:56] or we've come to come in contact with
[59:58] the supernatural god
[1:00:00] having to meet our needs and change our
[1:00:02] hearts to be made more like him
[1:00:04] hallelujah amen now
[1:00:08] they had to exchange this money to be
[1:00:10] for the um
[1:00:12] shekel of the sanctuary now we know god
[1:00:15] you know brother brown uses these
[1:00:16] scriptures many times you'd say in the
[1:00:18] beginning was the word
[1:00:19] and the word was with god and the word
[1:00:21] was god
[1:00:22] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:00:24] among us and we beheld his glory the
[1:00:26] glory is of the only begotten of the
[1:00:28] father
[1:00:29] full of grace and truth and he'd linked
[1:00:31] that that's you know john 1
[1:00:32] 1 and 114 and he'd link that together
[1:00:34] many times
[1:00:35] so he says now here's the invisible god
[1:00:38] and he's become flesh
[1:00:40] now that those two scriptures covered
[1:00:43] thousands of years
[1:00:44] where god would be invisible then he
[1:00:46] became visible in the logos yeah the
[1:00:48] pillar fire he condescended down
[1:00:50] through the prophets through the kings
[1:00:52] different ones till finally the fullness
[1:00:54] of god here bodily wasn't a man
[1:00:56] but here it was because a spirit cannot
[1:00:59] die
[1:01:01] a spirit cannot bleed a spirit cannot
[1:01:04] make an atonement
[1:01:05] it has to become flesh so so this shekel
[1:01:09] money you could say all this payment
[1:01:11] had to become flesh in order to make the
[1:01:14] ransom payment for you and i
[1:01:16] it wasn't just you know it wasn't just a
[1:01:19] spirit
[1:01:20] saying for something else you know
[1:01:22] brother and would say in a few places
[1:01:25] he says and jesus said when he was here
[1:01:27] on earth i do nothing of myself
[1:01:29] it's not me it's my father and he
[1:01:31] dwelleth in me see now the bible said
[1:01:33] that
[1:01:34] god the father was in christ the son
[1:01:36] reconciling the world to himself see
[1:01:38] so he was no more a man he was a god man
[1:01:41] he was not
[1:01:42] um he was the god man so not a god man
[1:01:45] he was the god man
[1:01:47] he was god made flesh to take away sin
[1:01:50] that's the only way it could be god had
[1:01:52] to suffer god couldn't suffer the
[1:01:53] penalty
[1:01:54] of his own judgment unless he was made
[1:01:56] flesh
[1:01:57] because god is immortal he's a spirit
[1:02:00] jesus said in saint john
[1:02:01] uh saint john the fourth chapter god is
[1:02:04] a spirit
[1:02:04] and they that worship him must worship
[1:02:06] him in spirit
[1:02:07] and truth and a spirit could not suffer
[1:02:10] death
[1:02:12] that this could not suffer death that
[1:02:14] the spirit had pronounced
[1:02:16] and the spirit did not send a prophet to
[1:02:19] take its place
[1:02:20] the spirit did not send a man to take
[1:02:22] its place the spirit came itself
[1:02:24] and flesh to take the place of it that's
[1:02:26] right god taken the place of a sinner
[1:02:28] and died in its dead and if i pronounce
[1:02:31] penalty
[1:02:33] upon everyone in here if they looked at
[1:02:35] that light
[1:02:36] and somebody looked and i didn't want
[1:02:38] them to die and i wanted to redeem them
[1:02:40] i could not ask my good brother good
[1:02:43] friend brother moore to take the place
[1:02:45] i could not ask brother joseph to take
[1:02:47] their place i could i would be unjust if
[1:02:50] i asked
[1:02:50] my boy sitting here billy paul to take
[1:02:52] the place the only way
[1:02:54] i can justly do it that's take the place
[1:02:57] myself
[1:02:58] that's the only way i can do it and
[1:03:00] justify and god is just
[1:03:02] so god came down and formed a body built
[1:03:05] it himself a tabernacle
[1:03:07] and they made him but how be it the most
[1:03:08] high dwelleth not in tabernacles made by
[1:03:11] hands
[1:03:11] but a body thou has prepared me that's
[1:03:13] right god made
[1:03:15] um god made the own body that he dwelt
[1:03:18] in
[1:03:18] and that body was his own son christ
[1:03:21] jesus god
[1:03:22] dwelt in christ reconciling the world to
[1:03:24] himself
[1:03:25] no man has seen the father at any time
[1:03:26] but the only begotten of the um
[1:03:28] the only begotten of the son has
[1:03:30] declared him that's right that's
[1:03:32] wonderful so the spirit could not die he
[1:03:35] had to become flesh in order to pay
[1:03:37] the ransom so so this shekel
[1:03:40] of the of the sanctuary there had to be
[1:03:42] a there had to be a change of that money
[1:03:44] in order for it to actually be used
[1:03:45] for a red um for for the redemption of
[1:03:48] the people
[1:03:49] it's the same thing where god had to
[1:03:50] become flesh for you and i you know i
[1:03:52] know we're looking at easter next
[1:03:53] weekend
[1:03:54] but you know i trust these things mean
[1:03:56] something to you where he had to become
[1:03:58] our redeemer he had to make that payment
[1:04:00] you know we had a debt we could not pay
[1:04:03] he had a debt he did not owe hallelujah
[1:04:06] but he came
[1:04:06] and purchased our salvation amen brother
[1:04:10] brown would say this he'd say now
[1:04:12] he'd say this in job 55 he says when god
[1:04:15] looked
[1:04:16] i says yonder i see adam and eve the
[1:04:18] first little sweethearts there in the
[1:04:20] garden of eden i see adam back there
[1:04:22] when he put his arms around his little
[1:04:24] sweetheart to walk out with her
[1:04:26] for god had condemned them and he
[1:04:28] started out with his arms around his
[1:04:29] darling
[1:04:30] adam was not deceived he didn't have to
[1:04:32] walk out but he walked out because he
[1:04:34] loved his wife
[1:04:35] he walked out with both eyes wide open
[1:04:38] no matter if she had to go to torment
[1:04:40] he'd go with her
[1:04:41] when god looked down and seen that love
[1:04:43] of a human being
[1:04:44] it was so great that he couldn't stand
[1:04:47] it himself
[1:04:48] that's right he said i'll come and go
[1:04:50] too and said i'll put enmity between her
[1:04:53] seed and the serpent sea
[1:04:55] so he's uh so so he didn't just kick
[1:04:56] them out of the garden and just
[1:04:58] watch them walk off he says i'm going to
[1:04:59] come with you i'm going to come with you
[1:05:01] through this
[1:05:02] through these ages amen until finally
[1:05:04] i'm made flesh i'm going to
[1:05:05] fix all this problem listen closely four
[1:05:08] thousand years later yonder and the city
[1:05:10] of jerusalem let's change our scenes and
[1:05:12] look
[1:05:12] there come down the streets of jerusalem
[1:05:14] bumpity bumpity bump
[1:05:16] out of the gates um out of the gates of
[1:05:17] damascus yonder out of the
[1:05:19] out of the damascus gate goes towards
[1:05:22] golgotha a little fallow
[1:05:23] with a crown on of little thorns on his
[1:05:26] head and a cross over his shoulder
[1:05:28] looked all over his back there's just
[1:05:30] little red spots what are they
[1:05:32] look back yondu and adam was leaving
[1:05:34] with his sweetheart going out under
[1:05:36] condemnation with a shadow
[1:05:38] a shadow of redemption somewhere because
[1:05:40] there was blood running over them
[1:05:41] somewhere there was a shadow he knew it
[1:05:44] i hear something going
[1:05:45] what was it it's old bloody sheepskin
[1:05:47] beating up and down on his legs speaking
[1:05:50] of some time
[1:05:51] there's a land beyond the river that
[1:05:53] they call the sweet forever
[1:05:55] and we only reach that shore by face
[1:05:57] decree
[1:05:58] knowing that someday they'll go back
[1:06:00] into eden again
[1:06:02] i just want let's just let's just let's
[1:06:03] just stop
[1:06:06] why does the lord why is he alive
[1:06:10] the reason we feel his presence the
[1:06:12] reason he's quickened his word to us the
[1:06:14] reason that he turned our hearts to walk
[1:06:16] with him
[1:06:17] it's because there's a heaven to go to
[1:06:19] all it is
[1:06:20] is heaven reaching down into this world
[1:06:22] into this realm
[1:06:24] trying to get a hold of you to take you
[1:06:26] back up to where it's from
[1:06:28] hallelujah we're heaven actually brother

[1:06:31] out upon the earth that redemption
[1:06:33] expanded out to come upon the earth
[1:06:35] to get you and i oh that's why when we
[1:06:37] feel his presence that sweet feeling

[1:07:27] where you going i'm on my way
[1:07:29] home we can even ask abraham if i could
[1:07:32] maybe put those words in his mouth
[1:07:34] abraham where are you going do you live
[1:07:36] here look you got all these cattle and
[1:07:37] sheep and tents and people and things

[1:07:43] to a city whose milk maker and builder
[1:07:46] is god

[1:08:17] through heaven's my home
[1:08:18] i've heard from my heavenly home and
[1:08:20] it's been calling me more and more every
[1:08:21] day

[1:08:25] come home hallelujah
[1:08:27] we're living in that season where we're
[1:08:28] going home amen you may think that's a
[1:08:31] crazy talk no it's not crazy talk
[1:08:33] it's reality harley abraham was fully
[1:08:36] persuaded
[1:08:37] he wasn't not sure am i going to have
[1:08:39] isaac is this going to happen how is
[1:08:41] this going to no
[1:08:42] he became fully persuaded he wasn't
[1:08:44] between two opinions he came to a spot
[1:08:46] where god was able to
[1:08:47] perform that which he had promised
[1:08:49] hallelujah and he just went rejoicing
[1:08:52] hallelujah what do you think of that
[1:08:55] four-letter word home
[1:08:56] are you on your way home when i talk
[1:08:59] about home
[1:09:00] i'm not talking about physical address
[1:09:02] i'm talking about heaven
[1:09:04] do you know that's where your home is i
[1:09:07] trust that you know
[1:09:08] not because maybe mom and dad say oh i'm
[1:09:10] saying it no yes
[1:09:11] something's quicker than your soul i'm
[1:09:13] going home
[1:09:16] we're gonna go home soon
[1:09:20] hallelujah so the lord went with them
[1:09:25] amen there's a lamb beyond the river so
[1:09:28] brother graham said he
[1:09:29] even said he saw them walk out of the
[1:09:31] garden where was he when he saw that
[1:09:33] you know you know he would say many
[1:09:34] times the people you know like one
[1:09:36] example
[1:09:37] i see you're on the operating table i
[1:09:39] see that some doctors have got your
[1:09:41] stomach or something in their hands
[1:09:42] they're looking at it they shake their
[1:09:43] head they put it back in
[1:09:44] where was he when he saw that he went
[1:09:47] back in time he was standing there
[1:09:48] seeing the whole thing
[1:09:48] unfold and when he saw the lord go up
[1:09:51] calvary
[1:09:52] he saw it he says when i see this he
[1:09:55] sees it in vision form when he's
[1:09:57] preaching
[1:09:58] hallelujah so it's more than just
[1:10:00] stories he's actually saying no i see
[1:10:03] this is how it takes place this is
[1:10:04] really you know how well because he's
[1:10:05] singing in visual form god is
[1:10:07] transporting him back there he says in
[1:10:10] one place i'm standing in two worlds
[1:10:12] so he's standing on the platform talking
[1:10:14] to someone but he's actually in a
[1:10:16] eternal realm seeing what has been seen
[1:10:19] what is and seeing what will be
[1:10:21] and that same god is here he knows all
[1:10:24] about our lives
[1:10:25] he knows everything about our lives he
[1:10:27] knows our motives our objectives what
[1:10:28] we're thinking even right now
[1:10:30] he knows all about us
[1:10:34] amen so i just say lord have your way in
[1:10:37] my life
[1:10:39] amen and now i see him going yonder now
[1:10:42] the second adam going up the hill
[1:10:45] the little spots on his back they get
[1:10:46] bigger and bigger and bigger as he walks
[1:10:48] on what was it
[1:10:49] after a while they go into one spot i
[1:10:52] hear something beating again what is it
[1:10:54] there goes the second adam no more than
[1:10:56] jehovah himself who
[1:10:58] come down was made flesh well i said
[1:11:00] that's a shekel of the sanctuary right
[1:11:01] there
[1:11:02] i mean even to go to hell for a
[1:11:03] sweetheart to redeem her back to
[1:11:06] uh uh to the one christ to redeem his
[1:11:08] bride hallelujah
[1:11:09] i seen it in adam yonder he came down
[1:11:12] was made flesh conforts with us
[1:11:14] that he might marry the human race to
[1:11:16] himself there he is going yonder
[1:11:18] to calvary and as he's moving up the
[1:11:20] hill and poor his little shoulder
[1:11:22] rubbing
[1:11:22] the old bee of death humming around him
[1:11:24] it ain't going to be long
[1:11:27] till i get him buzzing around and around
[1:11:29] after a while
[1:11:30] it had to sting him but friend you know
[1:11:32] if a bee ever stings anybody deeply he
[1:11:34] can't sting no more
[1:11:36] he pulls a stinger out so he hasn't got
[1:11:38] no more stinger and i tell you
[1:11:40] that's the reason god was made flesh
[1:11:41] here on earth in order to hold the
[1:11:44] stinger of death
[1:11:45] our death has no more sting the bee can
[1:11:48] buzz and swarm but he can't sting
[1:11:50] oh death where is our victory grave
[1:11:52] where is thy victory amen but christ the
[1:11:54] kinsmen redeemer has made
[1:11:56] a way of escape for every believer on
[1:11:58] this earth today
[1:12:00] the be might hum the be might buzz the
[1:12:02] bee might try and
[1:12:03] make you afraid but i can point you
[1:12:05] yonder to calvary where god himself was
[1:12:07] made flesh
[1:12:08] when he held the stinger of death he
[1:12:10] took my place as a sinner
[1:12:11] and paid the price and he laid out the
[1:12:13] welcome mat
[1:12:15] to me to come home whosoever will let
[1:12:19] him come and drink from the fountains of
[1:12:21] waters of life
[1:12:22] freely he that comes in comes i'll no
[1:12:25] wise
[1:12:26] cast out hallelujah
[1:12:29] that's our god amen he was the image of
[1:12:32] the invisible god as i said they
[1:12:34] couldn't look beyond the flesh to see
[1:12:36] that it was god made flesh
[1:12:37] hallelujah amen but we can
[1:12:41] not because of history but because we
[1:12:43] see god that same god has risen out of
[1:12:45] history
[1:12:46] hallelujah now he would come into the
[1:12:49] temple and he would make a scourge of
[1:12:50] ropes and he would drive out
[1:12:53] the sheep and the ox and poured out the
[1:12:54] change's money and overthrew the tables
[1:12:57] why because instead of something being a
[1:12:58] sacred piece of worship it turned into a
[1:13:01] money-making racket
[1:13:03] and then the disciples saw all this and
[1:13:06] they remembered that the zeal of thine
[1:13:07] house
[1:13:08] hath eaten me up so the zeal for his
[1:13:11] father's house eat him up so much that
[1:13:13] he
[1:13:14] he did all what we'd call scenes of
[1:13:16] great violence but he wanted to purify
[1:13:17] the temple
[1:13:18] that would be a place not of
[1:13:20] money-making or transactions but a place
[1:13:21] of worship
[1:13:23] amen and it should be the same thing
[1:13:24] with you and i i mean the lord sometimes
[1:13:26] needs to make a scourge of ropes and go
[1:13:28] through our life
[1:13:29] and drive out all these things that just
[1:13:31] make religion just a just a way of life
[1:13:33] instead of actually a living god
[1:13:35] amen brother ram says that you know that
[1:13:38] you know that god takes a d9
[1:13:39] d5 bulldozer down your tin can alley and
[1:13:42] just and just pushes all out of the way
[1:13:44] i'm in your alley of sin and everything
[1:13:46] in your life
[1:13:48] hallelujah amen
[1:13:52] hallelujah now to be pardoned no there's
[1:13:55] a reason he did this he wanted to live
[1:13:57] in people
[1:13:58] this may be very elementary but this is
[1:14:00] here we are in elementary
[1:14:03] god wanted to live in people he never
[1:14:06] wanted to just have a religion he didn't
[1:14:08] want religious people cain was very
[1:14:09] religious but that's not what god wanted
[1:14:11] i mean he wants people that he can live
[1:14:13] in there's this whole purpose of
[1:14:16] of of of being our atonement amen that
[1:14:18] we would receive the atonement would be
[1:14:20] become one with him now to be pardoned
[1:14:24] it's not just a mental change of
[1:14:25] thinking
[1:14:27] he says here in all things and i think
[1:14:30] it's an important thing that's pardoned
[1:14:31] i love that word
[1:14:32] pardoned actually the word means a
[1:14:34] release from guilt
[1:14:36] and what an experience that is to
[1:14:38] everyone who has had
[1:14:40] an experience of it to be released from
[1:14:42] guilt who's been released from guilt
[1:14:46] hallelujah not trying to turn away
[1:14:48] through some
[1:14:49] form of psychology turn away but be
[1:14:52] pardoned that means it's put away
[1:14:54] there's no more to it it's forgotten to
[1:14:56] turn away from anything
[1:14:58] you could turn back to it like sins at
[1:15:01] one time were covered
[1:15:03] but now they're not covered they're
[1:15:04] divorced they're completely gone
[1:15:06] put in the sea of god's forgetfulness to
[1:15:09] never be remembered no more
[1:15:10] he says i like that i mean this is not
[1:15:13] just we turn from something
[1:15:14] and we have to in our own ability keep
[1:15:16] from it that's not how this works
[1:15:18] i mean but to be pardoned you me it
[1:15:21] means to be released from guilt you're
[1:15:22] actually released from the thing
[1:15:24] when you receive the part and the
[1:15:25] atoning blood i mean the part and it
[1:15:27] actually turns you from it
[1:15:29] that you're actually released something
[1:15:30] that held you bound i mean you're no
[1:15:32] longer bound by it you cannot be bound
[1:15:34] by because you've been released from it
[1:15:35] hallelujah so that's why we can walk in
[1:15:38] liberty today it's not us trying to keep
[1:15:39] ourselves
[1:15:40] not us just seven steps if i do this
[1:15:42] every day i'll overcome no
[1:15:44] if the overcomer comes into you you'll
[1:15:46] overcome all things
[1:15:48] i mean because because he's already
[1:15:49] overcome all things he overcame cancer
[1:15:52] overcame all sickness all temptation all
[1:15:54] trials all hardship all
[1:15:56] all peer pressure pressure of the day
[1:15:58] everything he overcame all those things
[1:16:00] and if he has already overcome it and
[1:16:02] he's in you you've already overcome
[1:16:04] when you recognize the one and you has
[1:16:06] already overcome it then you will
[1:16:07] overcome it
[1:16:08] many times when two armies go to war
[1:16:10] they think can we win
[1:16:12] but if one side says absolutely we can
[1:16:14] win they go to war
[1:16:16] hallelujah they're not afraid can we can
[1:16:18] we beat this other nation yes we can
[1:16:20] we're going in
[1:16:21] hallelujah and i'm not talking about
[1:16:22] national battle i'm talking about
[1:16:24] battles against demon powers right now
[1:16:26] i mean that we're called out our weapons
[1:16:28] are our warfare or not carnal
[1:16:29] it's not through human reasoning it's
[1:16:31] not through political agenda trying to
[1:16:33] sway people's emotions
[1:16:34] it's not that kind of thing it's mighty
[1:16:36] through god through the pulling down of
[1:16:38] strongholds
[1:16:39] hallelujah so we go sometimes we think
[1:16:42] well can we win absolutely we can win
[1:16:44] do we have the best equipment absolutely
[1:16:46] do we have the best rugged training
[1:16:48] absolutely hallelujah so we shouldn't
[1:16:51] shrink back from any challenge
[1:16:53] our god is able and if he's able let's
[1:16:56] press the battle
[1:16:57] let's not give one place to the devil
[1:16:59] say well i guess i've got to live with
[1:17:00] this problem
[1:17:01] no hallelujah we don't have to put up
[1:17:04] with nothing
[1:17:06] amen hallelujah and so i think that's
[1:17:10] what pardon me
[1:17:12] means is completely erased not just turn
[1:17:14] aside and give something a try
[1:17:17] we don't want to give something a try
[1:17:19] you know when elijah's on mount carmel
[1:17:21] he's not just saying boys i'm just going
[1:17:22] to give this a try
[1:17:24] i'm here to show you god is god
[1:17:26] hallelujah so i just give him a try
[1:17:28] jesus christ is alive today but don't
[1:17:30] just well if it works out you know if
[1:17:32] this works out for me
[1:17:33] you know that's the problem with human
[1:17:35] love
[1:17:36] many people get together because it
[1:17:38] works out for them that's not love
[1:17:40] that's just convenience that's
[1:17:42] relationship builds a bonkin
[1:17:44] you're built upon convenience and a lot
[1:17:46] of people come to god that way
[1:17:48] well everything's going fine if this
[1:17:49] works out for me god i'll you know i'll
[1:17:51] serve you
[1:17:52] but when things get a bit shaky well i'm
[1:17:54] just gonna you know you're gonna i don't
[1:17:55] know about this no that's not it you
[1:17:58] sell out lock stock and barrel
[1:18:00] all that you are jumping boots and all
[1:18:02] here i am lord for good times for bad
[1:18:04] times and sickness and
[1:18:05] health good and bad whatever it may be
[1:18:07] lord i'm just here
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:10] hallelujah there's a reason i'm saying
[1:18:13] all this
[1:18:14] and and we will get to it okay because
[1:18:16] we don't walk by the five senses
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:25] but it's a race that's gone not turn
[1:18:27] aside
[1:18:28] uh we have like through pardon we are
[1:18:30] released
[1:18:32] not by psycholo not by psychology we are
[1:18:34] not released by a creed
[1:18:36] we're not released by emotion but we are
[1:18:39] released through the
[1:18:40] power of calvary that means there's a
[1:18:42] power in this day
[1:18:44] that's been released to release us
[1:18:47] we are pardoned free oh it means to be
[1:18:50] free
[1:18:51] a burden off your shoulders out of your
[1:18:53] heart a free person
[1:18:55] that's what it means to be pardoned
[1:18:57] who's been pardoned
[1:18:58] hallelujah amen we've been released
[1:19:01] through the power of calvary you know
[1:19:02] that's what this message has come to do
[1:19:04] this is why there's the fire
[1:19:06] manifestations of the spoken word
[1:19:08] and the prophets ministry because god
[1:19:09] wanted to show this is what my blood
[1:19:11] achieved this is what my word actually
[1:19:12] does
[1:19:13] it doesn't just make another religious
[1:19:15] movement god's on the show this is me
[1:19:16] living
[1:19:17] hallelujah and he did it because he
[1:19:19] wanted to show you and i
[1:19:20] that same life you see and you hear
[1:19:23] should be in you
[1:19:25] amen that's why that's why when brother
[1:19:26] brown preaches the rising of the sun
[1:19:28] i probably said this a lot but it means
[1:19:30] a lot to me to me he's not
[1:19:31] he's not just kind of pulling out from
[1:19:33] the scripture oh this is a nice easter
[1:19:35] text no
[1:19:36] he's making a declaration this is a new
[1:19:39] day
[1:19:40] this can be a new day for you but this
[1:19:42] is a different season you know
[1:19:44] we've had the darkness and you know
[1:19:45] you're the gloom of denomination but now
[1:19:47] a new day has risen
[1:19:49] hallelujah a new season has come you
[1:19:51] know i love it when he says in
[1:19:52] restoration of the bride tree
[1:19:53] he says he says when jesus was in the
[1:19:56] tomb dead that was luther
[1:19:58] and then when the tomb came open there
[1:19:59] was a rumor yeah you know
[1:20:01] different things that was like pentecost
[1:20:03] but then on the third day
[1:20:05] when he walked in their mitts walked
[1:20:07] into the room where he was
[1:20:08] i mean i mean where they were proved
[1:20:10] himself alive he wasn't a rumor no more
[1:20:12] he says he's alive today he says this is
[1:20:14] this day
[1:20:15] amen where he's no longer a rumor is he
[1:20:17] alive well i hear these people say this
[1:20:19] and
[1:20:19] this apologetics ministry says this and
[1:20:21] this says this no it's more than that
[1:20:24] it's god comes out of history to you and
[1:20:26] chose you
[1:20:27] personally i'm alive amen touch
[1:20:30] yes like he said to thomas put your
[1:20:32] hands on my side touch my hands and my
[1:20:34] feet
[1:20:34] and that and that word touch means
[1:20:36] verify by contact
[1:20:38] and we've come into contact with
[1:20:39] something we've come into contact with
[1:20:41] the jesus of the bible
[1:20:42] i mean who's alive forevermore but he
[1:20:44] wants you to know that
[1:20:46] because if you know that it makes a
[1:20:48] stability in your life you're not tossed
[1:20:50] to and through
[1:20:50] doesn't matter what's going on in life
[1:20:52] you can say i know the anchor holds
[1:20:54] i know i'm anchored beyond the veil so
[1:20:57] it doesn't matter what comes what goes
[1:20:59] i'm gonna walk on with you lord
[1:21:00] amen hallelujah so he preaches it's the
[1:21:03] rising of the sun
[1:21:04] and you go to leviticus there where the
[1:21:06] where the priest you know would be the
[1:21:08] first part of the harvest because we
[1:21:09] know if you look at a field of wheat or
[1:21:12] any any harvest for that matter
[1:21:14] it's not the same you know you know the
[1:21:16] harvest doesn't come to harvest
[1:21:18] condition at the same time
[1:21:19] some of the field can still be green a
[1:21:21] bird this can be
[1:21:22] ready here this is not ready but so what
[1:21:25] happened is that
[1:21:26] a portion of the harvestable wheat would
[1:21:29] be cut down
[1:21:30] and it was given to the priest a wave
[1:21:31] before the lord and thanksgiving
[1:21:34] and what the thanksgiving was is god it
[1:21:36] was thanksgiving to god god the rest of
[1:21:38] the seed in the field
[1:21:40] will come forth with the same life with
[1:21:42] the same maturity because it is the same
[1:21:44] life
[1:21:45] it's not a different seed it's the same
[1:21:48] seed
[1:21:49] same life and the same potentials
[1:21:51] hallelujah you take an apple seed you
[1:21:53] put it in the ground you get an apple
[1:21:54] tree and you eat the apple
[1:21:56] you take that seed you put it in the
[1:21:57] ground it grows a tree you get another
[1:21:59] apple
[1:22:01] you don't get a pumpkin you don't get a
[1:22:02] watermelon you don't get a tangerine you
[1:22:04] get another apple
[1:22:06] so if that seed was planted jesus said
[1:22:08] unless you know the greeks and stuff
[1:22:10] they said sirs we would see jesus
[1:22:12] and they saw a man may be sitting there
[1:22:14] and they couldn't quite you know see him
[1:22:16] for who he was but he would say to them
[1:22:18] well
[1:22:19] unless a seed die it doesn't die it
[1:22:21] abides alone but if it does die
[1:22:23] it'll bring forth much fruit so he's
[1:22:25] actually giving him the answer this is
[1:22:26] how you'll see me
[1:22:28] when i'm dead but i resurrected my same
[1:22:30] life comes into you
[1:22:31] you'll see me alive you'll see jesus
[1:22:34] hallelujah and we see jesus today amen
[1:22:37] so so so that part of the
[1:22:39] wheat field was way before the lord and
[1:22:41] it was the life of christ was waved on
[1:22:43] pentecost
[1:22:44] over a people and god was declaring
[1:22:48] this first fruit you see it will be
[1:22:49] reproduced
[1:22:51] in a people and there were 120 in the
[1:22:53] upper room
[1:22:54] it was waved over and what did it do it
[1:22:56] didn't make a just a religious movement
[1:22:59] it made a living people full of the
[1:23:00] living god
[1:23:02] living church of the living god filled
[1:23:03] with his goodness with his presence
[1:23:05] hallelujah and brother it says that same
[1:23:07] thing is repeated at the end time
[1:23:08] because there's two there's two harvests
[1:23:10] amen in the you know in the scripture
[1:23:12] the barley and the wheat harvest two
[1:23:13] different times
[1:23:14] i mean so the second one that same life
[1:23:16] has been waved over you and i
[1:23:19] it's been waved over the earth and god's
[1:23:21] rejoicing saying there's
[1:23:23] there's seed in the field hallelujah
[1:23:27] who was who was not alive when the
[1:23:28] prophet was alive
[1:23:31] so who is all born after 1965 we're in
[1:23:34] the field
[1:23:36] hallelujah i love it when brother cadre
[1:23:38] brought up at camp
[1:23:39] he said why why did they have to spend
[1:23:41] 40 years in the wilderness
[1:23:43] because rahab wasn't alive when they
[1:23:46] came out of egypt
[1:23:47] i mean she had to be in her place so
[1:23:49] there had to be a waiting period why
[1:23:51] because god's child had to come to birth
[1:23:53] had to come to her position for her to
[1:23:55] receive the spies
[1:23:57] hallelujah to come under a short token
[1:23:59] hallelujah
[1:24:00] and that's why we're still here upon the
[1:24:02] earth there's still seed that must come
[1:24:03] to life
[1:24:04] there's still seed in the field amen
[1:24:06] that must come to life
[1:24:07] and either the same life that you saw in
[1:24:09] the prophet
[1:24:10] is in the bride you know brother brown
[1:24:14] would would
[1:24:14] come to genesis 18 many times
[1:24:19] and he would speak of it we said you
[1:24:21] know
[1:24:22] god was made flesh and the two angels
[1:24:25] with him came down and spoke to abraham
[1:24:27] on the plains of memory and then so he
[1:24:29] would dramatize it many times because
[1:24:31] because go
[1:24:32] because sarah was in the tent behind
[1:24:33] where god was sitting
[1:24:35] and god was speaking to abraham and and
[1:24:37] and he would he would just
[1:24:39] ask where is sarah thy wife because
[1:24:41] according to time of life you have the
[1:24:42] promised son they were in their 90s
[1:24:45] she laughed within her heart saying how
[1:24:46] can i pleasure with my lord you know
[1:24:48] this is impossible how's this going to
[1:24:49] happen
[1:24:50] and then the lord just you know
[1:24:52] perceived what she was thinking and said
[1:24:54] why did sarah laugh
[1:24:56] you know and said now that was jesus
[1:24:58] christ yesterday
[1:24:59] there and in the new testament he did it
[1:25:01] as well he's the same today
[1:25:03] he says now i'll turn my back he says
[1:25:06] someone back here
[1:25:08] such and such and such accurate what's
[1:25:10] he trying to do
[1:25:11] he's trying to get the people to see
[1:25:13] where in genesis 18.
[1:25:15] before the burning of the world there's
[1:25:18] a people who've been called out
[1:25:20] they're not even tangled up inside him
[1:25:21] like lot was but they've been called out
[1:25:23] by a word
[1:25:24] amen the scripture says come out of her
[1:25:26] my people be not partaker of her plagues
[1:25:28] we've heard a voice i said come here i
[1:25:31] am
[1:25:32] here i am hallelujah thank you lord we
[1:25:34] came out
[1:25:35] but then brother brown doesn't just
[1:25:37] leave it there was god
[1:25:39] because many times what i mean by that
[1:25:41] is
[1:25:42] many times people just say yes that was
[1:25:44] god manifested in flesh
[1:25:46] and the prophets identifying his own
[1:25:48] ministry there
[1:25:49] so that's just that's just for him
[1:25:53] he says in christ and mr god revealed
[1:26:02] what did they recognize that if he could
[1:26:05] ever heal or redeem or save
[1:26:07] or set free before he could do he could
[1:26:10] do the same thing for them
[1:26:12] and as it was in the days of noah so
[1:26:14] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:26:15] man
[1:26:16] and as the days of lot when a modern
[1:26:18] billy graham and old roberts went down
[1:26:20] to sodom and preached to them sodomites
[1:26:22] and blinded their eyes see with the
[1:26:24] gospel one angel stayed back a messenger
[1:26:26] with abraham
[1:26:28] and the elected group and what kind of
[1:26:30] sign did he do
[1:26:31] see and what did abraham call him elohim
[1:26:34] that's a self-existing one
[1:26:37] god manifested in flesh jesus showing
[1:26:41] that he himself god in him would be
[1:26:44] manifested in his bride
[1:26:46] in the last days so it's not just even
[1:26:48] in the prophet
[1:26:49] he says in his bride and the who's the
[1:26:51] bride of christ
[1:26:53] i believe i'm looking at at a portion of
[1:26:55] her from around the world
[1:26:57] so saying that elohim all that god was
[1:27:01] would be manifested in a people
[1:27:04] today so now it's not just
[1:27:08] in a prophet's ministry just like he
[1:27:10] even said the ministry the son of man
[1:27:13] is in people and human beings so it's
[1:27:16] not just in one man it's in
[1:27:18] us the minister the son of man continues
[1:27:20] on through the bride
[1:27:22] just like how brother brown would say
[1:27:24] that i'll ride this trail again that's
[1:27:26] god speaking first person saying
[1:27:28] i'm gonna i'm gonna do the same thing
[1:27:29] again but not through the prophet but
[1:27:31] through the people
[1:27:33] it's god speaking through that's god
[1:27:35] speaking first person through a man you
[1:27:37] say does he do that well david will be
[1:27:39] caught up in the spirit he'd say my god
[1:27:41] my god why is that forsaken me
[1:27:43] my bones they stare at me they you know
[1:27:45] they you know they you know the balls of
[1:27:47] basham have compassed about me all the
[1:27:48] you know they pierced my hands and my
[1:27:50] feet
[1:27:50] now if we went back there maybe we'd see
[1:27:52] david sitting by a window playing his
[1:27:54] heart caught up in the spirit
[1:27:55] and he'd be crying out my god my god why
[1:27:57] is that forsaken me
[1:27:58] and we'd look at him say you're not
[1:28:00] forsaken david the crown's on your head
[1:28:02] the kingdom's under your feet we all
[1:28:04] love you you're not forsaken
[1:28:05] but god was speaking first person
[1:28:07] through him because he was looking at
[1:28:09] calvary
[1:28:10] as if he was literally on the cross
[1:28:13] god can speak first person through a man
[1:28:17] hallelujah so now he says the elohim
[1:28:19] would be would be manifested god will be
[1:28:21] manifested in flesh
[1:28:23] now if you think about this
[1:28:26] our god is present in us
[1:28:29] now he said i'd never leave him or
[1:28:31] forsake thee
[1:28:32] now if god is in us everything we have
[1:28:35] need of is in him
[1:28:37] and we have it available right so now
[1:28:41] if god was ever jehovah jireh the lord
[1:28:44] will provide himself a sacrifice
[1:28:47] he's still jehovah jireh today amen if
[1:28:50] he is
[1:28:51] ever jehovah wrath of the lord mahila he
[1:28:54] still heal healer today
[1:28:56] right and he's not somewhere up in the
[1:28:57] heavens someplace only
[1:28:59] but he's even present in this room just
[1:29:01] now amen he's not and he's not just
[1:29:03] present here but if you have the baptism
[1:29:05] of the holy ghost he's in you
[1:29:07] hello so if he ever was jehovah jiren
[1:29:09] now if we look at jehovah jireh
[1:29:11] when abraham took isaac up the mountain
[1:29:14] to
[1:29:14] to sacrifice him and then and then even
[1:29:18] isaac didn't know that he was a
[1:29:19] sacrifice but he was carrying the wood
[1:29:21] they had the flame or whatever you know
[1:29:23] he goes up the hill
[1:29:24] and you know and he's and he's looking
[1:29:26] at at his father and he says father
[1:29:28] here's the word you know this is
[1:29:30] probably where we're going but where's
[1:29:32] the sacrifice
[1:29:33] and he said the lord himself will
[1:29:35] provide a sacrifice
[1:29:36] and then so when abraham was just about
[1:29:38] to draw the knife and you know plunge it
[1:29:40] into
[1:29:40] the neck or the heart of isaac you know
[1:29:43] his hand was stayed
[1:29:45] and and and he was told don't sacrifice
[1:29:48] him
[1:29:48] and then he looked over and he saw a ram
[1:29:51] was caught in a thicket
[1:29:52] now the question was where did that ram
[1:29:54] come from why didn't he see it when they
[1:29:56] were walking up the hill
[1:29:57] that's because god provided the ram
[1:30:00] when the ram was needed because when
[1:30:04] when when when god saw that abraham was
[1:30:06] willing to give his only son
[1:30:08] when he was willing to go all the way
[1:30:10] god provided really what abraham needed
[1:30:13] i mean so that that that ram appeared
[1:30:16] there
[1:30:17] when it wasn't there before hallelujah
[1:30:21] so god can make things appear
[1:30:24] where they don't seem to be there
[1:30:26] hallelujah
[1:30:28] so you say well i'm sick and body well
[1:30:29] he can he he can just make healing
[1:30:31] appear
[1:30:32] we need salvation he can make it appear
[1:30:35] hallelujah deliverance he can make it
[1:30:37] appear
[1:30:37] where it seems where is it where how's
[1:30:39] this going to come i don't know he's
[1:30:40] still jehovah gyra
[1:30:43] hallelujah he's still jehovah gyra right
[1:30:45] now
[1:30:47] you need a revival he'll provide you a
[1:30:49] revival
[1:30:50] hallelujah you need encouragement
[1:30:52] stability joy
[1:30:54] he'll provide those things hallelujah
[1:30:57] i mean he says in abraham 55. he says
[1:31:00] now
[1:31:01] up on the mountain there he took his own
[1:31:03] son tied his hands behind him
[1:31:06] laid him upon the altar reached down
[1:31:07] pulled out the knife
[1:31:09] pulled the little fellow's throat back
[1:31:10] he raised up his hand to stab his own
[1:31:12] son to death
[1:31:13] and about that time the holy ghost
[1:31:14] caught his hand said abraham stay your
[1:31:16] hand
[1:31:16] don't be scared to walk right down to
[1:31:19] the last row of life with him god will
[1:31:21] be there on the scene
[1:31:22] he's jehovah jireh god will provide a
[1:31:24] sacrifice he will make a provision
[1:31:27] amen and about that time he heard
[1:31:29] something bleat and there was a little
[1:31:31] ram hooked in the wilderness by his
[1:31:32] horns
[1:31:33] where did that ram come from they were
[1:31:35] hundreds of miles from civilization
[1:31:37] they were way up on a mountain where
[1:31:39] there's no water how'd that ram get
[1:31:41] there
[1:31:41] he's still jehovah gyra no matter what
[1:31:43] the circumstances
[1:31:44] is he can provide the sacrifice at any
[1:31:47] time
[1:31:48] i mean no matter what the circumstances
[1:31:50] in he's jehovah jireh
[1:31:51] now look it wasn't a vision he walked
[1:31:54] over he picked up the ram he laid it out
[1:31:55] there and stabbed it with a knife and
[1:31:57] blood came out of it it wasn't a vision
[1:31:59] he saw it
[1:32:00] it was actually a ram it was christ the
[1:32:02] lamb of god slammed from the foundations
[1:32:04] of the world hallelujah
[1:32:05] there he was christ it wasn't a vision
[1:32:07] that
[1:32:08] lamb was spoke into existence in the
[1:32:10] last minute
[1:32:11] and went out of existence in another
[1:32:13] minute the same way that god made
[1:32:14] himself manifested in the flesh before
[1:32:16] abraham
[1:32:17] and went out of existence in another
[1:32:18] minute he's the same god
[1:32:20] that someday these these atoms of yours
[1:32:23] will break and go out
[1:32:24] life will go out of this body and he
[1:32:26] will speak and bring it back into
[1:32:28] existence someday
[1:32:29] in the resurrection he's jehovah jireh
[1:32:32] how did he do it i don't know that's his
[1:32:34] business
[1:32:35] but he said he would do it and i believe
[1:32:37] him jehovah jireh the lord will provide
[1:32:39] himself a sacrifice
[1:32:41] no matter what it is the lord the lamb
[1:32:43] was there he provided a lamb
[1:32:45] when it needed a lamb when you're sick
[1:32:47] and you need healing
[1:32:48] he'll provide for you if you need
[1:32:50] salvation he provides for you
[1:32:52] if you need a revival he will provide
[1:32:54] for you if the
[1:32:55] meal barrel is empty he'll provide it
[1:32:57] for you amen
[1:32:58] if you're all down-hearted and drooped
[1:33:00] over god will provide for you
[1:33:02] for he was wounded for our
[1:33:03] transgressions bruised for our iniquity
[1:33:06] the chastiser of peace was upon him and
[1:33:08] with his stripes were healed amen
[1:33:10] the lord's provided sacrifice the laws
[1:33:13] provided lamb
[1:33:14] amen so he's still jehovah gyra this
[1:33:16] morning oh he's still jehovah rapha this
[1:33:19] morning
[1:33:19] he's still our shield he's still out
[1:33:21] banner amen he's still the lord's
[1:33:23] present jehovah shammer
[1:33:25] hallelujah amen you know how powerful a
[1:33:28] testimony is
[1:33:30] a testimony can spark many more of the
[1:33:32] same
[1:33:33] you know there was a there was a woman
[1:33:35] and and i mentioned her in a quote
[1:33:37] earlier before but you know
[1:33:38] she she had the blood issue for many
[1:33:41] years
[1:33:42] but she looked beyond jesus the man
[1:33:45] and so she could get healing she somehow
[1:33:48] saw that he was jehovah rapha and she
[1:33:51] was determined if i could just
[1:33:53] touch the hem of his garment i'll be
[1:33:55] made whole there are many other people
[1:33:57] around them
[1:33:57] but she went with one purpose you know
[1:34:00] if we just go with one purpose to the
[1:34:01] lord
[1:34:02] hallelujah we said lord i have this need
[1:34:05] hallelujah we can get it
[1:34:09] we can actually get it i mean that's
[1:34:11] just not empty words you can actually
[1:34:13] get it
[1:34:14] she really got what she needed amen when
[1:34:17] she touched the hem of his garment
[1:34:19] amen and when she touched it she was
[1:34:22] made perfectly whole
[1:34:24] now this began to spread hallelujah that
[1:34:27] was in matthew 9.
[1:34:29] now matthew 14 it says we and when they
[1:34:31] were gone over they came to the land of
[1:34:33] guinness um genocide if that's how you
[1:34:36] say it
[1:34:37] and when the men of that place had
[1:34:39] knowledge of him they sent out into all
[1:34:41] the country roundabout and brought
[1:34:43] unto him all that were diseased and they
[1:34:45] besought him that they might only touch
[1:34:47] the hem of his garment
[1:34:49] and as many as touch were made perfectly
[1:34:51] whole
[1:34:52] why is it because i heard a testimony of
[1:34:54] one woman and they realized
[1:34:56] if he's jehovah rapha there he's still
[1:34:58] the same jehovah rapha here he didn't
[1:35:00] suddenly stop becoming
[1:35:01] our healer there just because that woman
[1:35:03] touched him you know he's an
[1:35:04] inexhaustible fountain
[1:35:06] you can't we can't drain him with his
[1:35:08] goodness of his power to heal the power
[1:35:10] to save the power to redeem
[1:35:12] aiming the power to deliver he never
[1:35:14] gets empty on that says hold on boys i
[1:35:16] need to plug in and recharge a bit
[1:35:17] no no he's inexhaustible so they knew if
[1:35:20] he could heal there
[1:35:21] then he'll heal here and they brought
[1:35:23] their sickness and they just touched him
[1:35:24] of his garment
[1:35:25] so the same testimony she had they all
[1:35:27] had
[1:35:28] hallelujah why because a testimony
[1:35:31] sparks many more of the same
[1:35:33] hallelujah you know he would he would
[1:35:35] cast seven devils out of mary magdalene
[1:35:38] and brother brown would say in a few
[1:35:40] places it was like pride and envy and
[1:35:41] different things that people don't even
[1:35:43] know they have
[1:35:44] and they were cast out of her and then
[1:35:46] there was another woman
[1:35:48] who was stirred up that heard that
[1:35:50] testimony and she was a woman
[1:35:53] that that that hung around a place where
[1:35:55] jesus was invited and jesus was invited
[1:35:57] to a feast to be made fun of by
[1:35:59] by by um simon the pharisee as we all
[1:36:02] know
[1:36:02] she wasn't even invited to the feast but
[1:36:05] something when she heard that testimony
[1:36:07] something anchored in her heart if he
[1:36:09] can forgive her
[1:36:11] and i'm a harlot too i can be forgiven
[1:36:14] hallelujah and then so she would say
[1:36:17] here
[1:36:18] i mean i mean there's brother-in-law
[1:36:19] testimony upon the sea here he
[1:36:22] set in here that night that day and this
[1:36:24] little woman
[1:36:25] said if that's who i think it is that's
[1:36:27] that man
[1:36:29] i believe he's a prophet and he was the
[1:36:31] one who forgave mary magdalene
[1:36:34] that woman just as bad as me forgave her
[1:36:36] sins
[1:36:37] down the city she went and into an old
[1:36:39] ally upper creaky steps an old check
[1:36:42] reached down there pulled out a little
[1:36:44] money she collected on her ill way of
[1:36:45] living
[1:36:46] she pulled this out this money bag she
[1:36:48] said i can't do it he's a prophet
[1:36:50] and he'd know how i got this money but
[1:36:52] it's all i can do
[1:36:54] that's all i've got i must see him i'm a
[1:36:56] sinner i must ask him to forgive me
[1:36:58] hello she went and she got when i got
[1:37:00] the alabaster box somehow she got past
[1:37:02] the foot wash flunky past the guards
[1:37:04] past the waiters
[1:37:05] and they went right down to where jesus
[1:37:07] was and she didn't even ask
[1:37:09] permission but she took the alabaster
[1:37:11] box she broke it she poured it out
[1:37:13] i mean they should be gonna weep away
[1:37:15] amen hallelujah
[1:37:16] wash washes wash his feet with her tears
[1:37:19] and dry it with her hair and everything
[1:37:21] why because she heard a testimony that
[1:37:24] another prostitute was forgiven
[1:37:25] and she was the same kind of woman and
[1:37:28] she knew if i can just get to him i must
[1:37:30] ask him to forgive me
[1:37:31] amen harlow what to do it sparked a
[1:37:34] testimony
[1:37:36] amen our god is still god
[1:37:39] our jesus is still jesus amen
[1:37:42] he has not changed
[1:37:46] at all he cannot change it's one thing
[1:37:49] god cannot change he can't lie and he
[1:37:50] can't change
[1:37:52] so if so if someone was forgiven that
[1:37:54] way or healed that way
[1:37:56] we can be healed the same way hallelujah
[1:37:59] but we have to be able to look to the
[1:38:01] unseen
[1:38:04] brotherhood says look at the unseen when
[1:38:06] a man once catches
[1:38:08] that vision of the invisible god and he
[1:38:11] knows that he's always present
[1:38:14] there is something that stabilizes that
[1:38:16] man's thinking
[1:38:18] it stabilizes his actions and in the
[1:38:21] time of distress and trouble
[1:38:23] it'll still make him look upward and
[1:38:25] above the things that are happening
[1:38:26] around him
[1:38:28] because he's looking at the unseen
[1:38:31] yet by promise so we catch a vision of
[1:38:34] the unseen who's
[1:38:35] who who's caught a vision of the unseen
[1:38:40] when you see when brother brown preaches
[1:38:42] the opening of the word
[1:38:43] it's more than just symbols you'll look
[1:38:45] past the symbol and see christ
[1:38:47] i mean where where he brother even said
[1:38:50] that the
[1:38:51] opening the seals reveals christ
[1:38:54] and you catch a glimpse we're in the
[1:38:56] second part of redemption
[1:38:58] we're in the season of the body change
[1:39:01] hallelujah we've been called
[1:39:03] to a body change so now what are we
[1:39:06] doing we're looking to the unseen
[1:39:09] and what does that do it puts us
[1:39:11] stability
[1:39:13] who has a greater stability in their
[1:39:14] life now i'm not talking about who has
[1:39:16] less trouble
[1:39:17] because anyone you know is like why do
[1:39:19] we love going on holiday because there's
[1:39:20] no trouble
[1:39:22] there's no burden of bills no worry
[1:39:24] about that you just you're on holiday
[1:39:26] and you're and your world is kind of
[1:39:27] shrugged down into this little thing
[1:39:29] that you just enjoy
[1:39:30] anyone can have a anyone can have a
[1:39:32] stable life in a holiday
[1:39:34] so i'm not talking about the removal of
[1:39:36] trouble but i'm talking about
[1:39:38] who who's actually more stable now on
[1:39:40] their walk in their life
[1:39:42] since they came to the lord why is that
[1:39:44] because it's because you've caught
[1:39:46] a vision of the invisible god so now
[1:39:49] you're not following what the five
[1:39:51] senses declare
[1:39:52] or how you feel but now you're following
[1:39:55] a sure word of promise
[1:39:57] you're following the lord himself i mean
[1:40:00] so now
[1:40:00] we have a stability that stabilizes the
[1:40:02] man's thinking
[1:40:04] and it stabilizes our actions hallelujah
[1:40:08] i'm sure we can all attest to that amen
[1:40:12] you know brother aaron makes a statement
[1:40:13] in the great great warrior joshua
[1:40:17] he says what am i trying to do trying to
[1:40:20] get you to see
[1:40:21] where you're at do we know where we're
[1:40:23] at oh we're in 2021 now i'm not talking
[1:40:25] about that
[1:40:26] do you know where you're at in christ
[1:40:28] we're now seated together in heavenly
[1:40:30] places in christ jesus
[1:40:31] our sins are dead in the red sea our
[1:40:35] task masters have been drowned
[1:40:37] amen the enemy's defeated the whole land
[1:40:40] is open before us
[1:40:41] you know the devil actually quakes has
[1:40:43] lost you know morale is shot in hell
[1:40:46] when they came to jericho you know the
[1:40:49] report
[1:40:50] that this you know rahab began to
[1:40:52] testify
[1:40:53] of the condition of the armies in
[1:40:55] jericho and she did not say how thick
[1:40:57] the walls are how sharp their shields
[1:40:59] are oh
[1:40:59] shove their shelter how sharp their
[1:41:01] swords are and how ready they are
[1:41:03] outwardly they may look very drilled and
[1:41:05] prepared soldiers
[1:41:07] but she would actually testify that the
[1:41:09] hearts of all the men have melted
[1:41:11] because of
[1:41:12] you because of you you
[1:41:16] are the one who's caused the morale to
[1:41:18] be shot in the city
[1:41:19] hallelujah it's not anything else it's
[1:41:21] because of you
[1:41:23] and i don't know how big those spies
[1:41:24] were it's irrelevant i mean they could
[1:41:26] have been the smallest man of the
[1:41:27] smallest tribe if you're from israel
[1:41:29] but they were shaking just because of
[1:41:32] their presence
[1:41:34] hallelujah do you know the morale and
[1:41:35] hell is shot
[1:41:37] do you know you know you know you know
[1:41:39] he can boast all he wants
[1:41:41] you know how many times you know how
[1:41:42] many times he would have hated it
[1:41:44] where he would come into a meeting he
[1:41:45] says i'm gonna i'm gonna tear this
[1:41:47] meeting up
[1:41:47] i'm gonna get my revenge on this little
[1:41:49] prophet of god and then
[1:41:51] and then brother brown would would
[1:41:52] remind the devil night after night
[1:41:54] prayer line after prayer line satan
[1:41:56] you're nothing but a bluff
[1:41:58] turn these people loose in the name of
[1:42:00] jesus christ and he had to let them go
[1:42:02] why because his bluff was called you've
[1:42:04] got to call the devil's hand
[1:42:07] i mean you as you say devil you may be
[1:42:09] pretending you know what pope
[1:42:10] i trust no one knows what poker face is
[1:42:12] but you know what poker faces they
[1:42:14] you can have all these dud cards but a
[1:42:16] good poker player
[1:42:18] will never in their expression reveal
[1:42:21] what's in their hand
[1:42:23] they'll look the same if they've won or
[1:42:25] they've lost or
[1:42:26] and they'll try and bluff the other
[1:42:28] players to make foolish things you know
[1:42:30] if
[1:42:32] you know that's what poker faces i'm
[1:42:34] glad some people look at me saying i
[1:42:35] don't know what that means and now i do
[1:42:38] but the devil has a real mean poker face
[1:42:42] because he's nothing but a bluff
[1:42:44] hallelujah
[1:42:45] he has a losing hand but you've got to
[1:42:47] call his hand say satan
[1:42:49] my lord defeated you that down calvary
[1:42:51] he's you're still defeated today
[1:42:53] i'm here to call your hand oh the
[1:42:55] prophet can do that but i can't who said
[1:42:58] he had to be redeemed like you had to be
[1:42:59] redeemed he had to be saved the same way
[1:43:01] you had to be saved
[1:43:02] he received revelation the same way you
[1:43:04] receive revelation
[1:43:06] hallelujah amen so the morale
[1:43:09] and hell is shot it's gone
[1:43:13] the devil's nothing but a bluff he knows
[1:43:14] he has but a short time says my mother
[1:43:16] just try and wreck the place as much as
[1:43:18] i can
[1:43:18] and he wrecks and he wrecks and he
[1:43:20] wrecks and he wrecks becomes a child of
[1:43:21] god and the wrecking ball just doesn't
[1:43:23] swing
[1:43:24] it may try hallelujah
[1:43:27] there's something in us that's unmovable
[1:43:30] it's unshakable
[1:43:31] sure our emotions get all wild and
[1:43:33] worried but we have a rock that we can
[1:43:34] go to
[1:43:35] i mean there's something in us that we
[1:43:37] just can't actually you know i was
[1:43:38] thinking about this
[1:43:40] imagine if they confiscated all their
[1:43:42] all of our bibles all our message books
[1:43:43] we had no way
[1:43:45] they can't take what's out of our heart
[1:43:47] i mean they can't take what's in our
[1:43:49] heart
[1:43:50] so they could take away our church they
[1:43:51] i'm not saying they will but they could
[1:43:53] take away our church they could take
[1:43:54] away
[1:43:54] our bibles everything but the bible's in
[1:43:57] here
[1:43:58] the word is in here it's not in here
[1:44:01] it's down in here
[1:44:02] that's why people can walk with god
[1:44:04] without a bible or anything but they can
[1:44:06] still walk victorious
[1:44:08] so there's something in us that's
[1:44:09] unshakable hallelujah
[1:44:12] hallelujah amen so the morale
[1:44:15] and hell is shot now why was it shot
[1:44:18] well
[1:44:18] let's say jericho hell same thing yeah
[1:44:20] i'll just parallel out that well if
[1:44:21] that's okay
[1:44:22] but the morale and jericho were so shot
[1:44:25] because of them
[1:44:26] but why what made them special god made
[1:44:28] them special
[1:44:30] hallelujah the praise of god was over
[1:44:32] them as they walked through the
[1:44:33] wilderness
[1:44:34] and that same god came with them into
[1:44:36] the promised land hallelujah
[1:44:38] and when they're about to face jericho
[1:44:40] the angel lord came down the captain of
[1:44:41] the host of the lord with a sword drawn
[1:44:43] as he and joshua asked him are you for
[1:44:45] us or against us
[1:44:46] he says no i'm not for you i'm not
[1:44:48] against you i've come to take over this
[1:44:50] battle
[1:44:51] as the same thing with you and i you
[1:44:53] know the lord we think things are just
[1:44:55] happening on earth and and
[1:44:57] things are idle in heaven no things are
[1:44:58] happening in heaven
[1:45:00] you know it says in the book of daniel
[1:45:03] that michael the great prince will stand
[1:45:04] up for his people in a time of trouble
[1:45:07] we're living in a time of trouble but
[1:45:09] you know the lord has risen in this day
[1:45:12] i mean to fix us fix things for us to
[1:45:14] leave yes
[1:45:16] hallelujah so the morale and jericho was
[1:45:17] shot because of them because the god
[1:45:19] they served
[1:45:20] hallelujah and didn't matter the
[1:45:22] boasting of the people of jericho
[1:45:24] that fell down flat hallelujah
[1:45:28] that same god is with us today
[1:45:31] very same one not a different one same
[1:45:34] one
[1:45:36] hallelujah
[1:45:39] you ever seen something fall down with
[1:45:40] the shout out
[1:45:42] you ever seen some walls fall down with
[1:45:43] the shout out hallelujah
[1:45:46] you have a time of prayer you're at camp
[1:45:48] some obstacle you're facing i can't get
[1:45:50] over it i can't get through it i can't
[1:45:52] get under it
[1:45:53] who's had that is like a blockage and
[1:45:55] the devil
[1:45:56] fights you in your mind troubles you and
[1:45:58] your spirit but then you
[1:46:00] somehow the lord and the sovereignty
[1:46:01] just comes down it's nothing you work
[1:46:03] out he just comes down
[1:46:04] are you going to shout and praise god
[1:46:06] what happens the walls fall down flat
[1:46:08] hallelujah hallelujah hey
[1:46:11] man hey we had you know i probably
[1:46:14] shared this testimony
[1:46:15] too many times but i'll share it one
[1:46:17] more time you know the first house we
[1:46:19] lived in here freckleton grove and you
[1:46:21] know
[1:46:21] and in low hut there's a demon spirit in
[1:46:23] that house
[1:46:24] we felt that i felt a genuine oppression
[1:46:27] whenever i came into view of that house
[1:46:29] when i left it went to work it lifted
[1:46:30] and we started fighting and we never
[1:46:32] fight there was trouble you know
[1:46:34] and you know there was there was a real
[1:46:36] oppression in that house
[1:46:38] and we came to a spot we realized
[1:46:39] actually this is the devil in this house
[1:46:42] and we prayed but there was one time
[1:46:44] when we prayed it wasn't something that
[1:46:46] we worked up but the lord just came down
[1:46:48] and we started shouting and rejoicing
[1:46:51] and that spirit went out
[1:46:53] why it went out with a shout out
[1:46:55] hallelujah
[1:46:57] hallelujah you know our god still does
[1:46:59] those kind of things
[1:47:01] amen he says here
[1:47:06] what am i trying to do so i'm going back
[1:47:08] to that verse i mean i mean i mean back
[1:47:10] to this quote what am i trying to do
[1:47:11] trying to get to see where you're at if
[1:47:14] you
[1:47:14] only get your eyes open and look just
[1:47:17] look yonder
[1:47:18] where you're standing why sickness
[1:47:21] would melt away from you like a snowball
[1:47:25] on a hot stove in the summertime
[1:47:28] diseases and so forth because christ
[1:47:30] promised it it's his promise
[1:47:33] to me that's an astounding statement we
[1:47:35] just really see where we're standing now
[1:47:36] i'm not talking about these four walls
[1:47:38] our position in christ the great captain
[1:47:41] of the host of the lord is present
[1:47:43] i mean with us now look when this angel
[1:47:46] was whirling above them in a sign of a
[1:47:47] pillar of fire
[1:47:49] then it was in the night time in the
[1:47:50] daytime it looked like a white cloud
[1:47:52] circling over them that's the children
[1:47:53] of israel as they journeyed
[1:47:55] and when they come under this he said
[1:47:57] now i'm going to send him before you
[1:47:59] now i give you palestine all of it's
[1:48:01] yours just go possess
[1:48:02] it that's all you have to do well here
[1:48:05] they started god bless them
[1:48:07] and giving them great big joys and great
[1:48:10] big revivals and so forth
[1:48:12] as they went and they come right up
[1:48:14] there and because they'd seen it was all
[1:48:16] possessed all over
[1:48:17] with a great big opposition they were
[1:48:19] scared
[1:48:20] god said how long will i suffer with you
[1:48:22] since moses step out of the way
[1:48:24] i'll slay every one of them after i
[1:48:26] perform these now if that ain't a
[1:48:28] picture
[1:48:28] of the pentecostal church today said as
[1:48:31] many miracles as i performed here before
[1:48:33] them
[1:48:34] and showed in the face of the unbeliever
[1:48:35] that i called them
[1:48:37] and i perform these miracles and yet
[1:48:38] they don't believe me what a rebuke to
[1:48:40] the church
[1:48:41] as many things that i've done i've
[1:48:42] healed the sick the lame the blind i've
[1:48:44] raised the dead i perform miracles
[1:48:46] i've done everything all across the
[1:48:48] country and yet they don't believe me
[1:48:50] i give them the holy holy spirit brought
[1:48:52] them into the covenant
[1:48:54] what did he what did he do israel
[1:48:57] sure right through the red sea and the
[1:48:59] baptism on out
[1:49:00] give them joy happiness before miracles
[1:49:02] fed them
[1:49:03] yet they disbelieved and he said there's
[1:49:05] just
[1:49:06] there's something just a little bit
[1:49:09] beyond
[1:49:10] oh we're satisfied to belong to church
[1:49:13] as long as we've got a church as a
[1:49:14] writer
[1:49:15] i suppose here come joshua back and
[1:49:18] caleb said the land is real
[1:49:20] here's the evidence praise be to god
[1:49:23] here's the evidence that god
[1:49:25] promises true we give evidence
[1:49:28] here to prove it that's why i say in the
[1:49:31] beginning
[1:49:33] if you met the lord stand up you've been
[1:49:34] healed there's evidence
[1:49:36] that the land is real it's not
[1:49:38] psychology
[1:49:40] it's not a nice idea amen but we have a
[1:49:43] true and living god
[1:49:45] in our midst here to release to you
[1:49:48] your desires you have in him hallelujah
[1:49:53] so ask the question if you say you're
[1:49:57] not sure yet
[1:49:58] why not but if you are sure
[1:50:02] aren't you glad are you glad he's made
[1:50:04] you sure
[1:50:06] he's so real he just wants you to be i'm

[1:50:11] the voice the other troubles you may
