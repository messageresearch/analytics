cloudless sky I'm drinking from a fountain that never shall run dry I'm feasting on the manner of a bountiful supply for I'm dwelling in butyl and you know when you when you well in the holiest of Holies it doesn't really matter what the climate that side is doing what the weather is doing anything like that it's irrelevant what the situation is like in your life whether it's good or bad or that it doesn't matter and that's the epitome of the Christian walk is really dwelling in that place because when you boil it all down what does all this really matter whether this or that it's all

Jesus Christ name Amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this night so I want to speak about scriptural authority no no I'm not speaking about the authority of Scripture necessarily how we know the word is true you know the Bible is correct we have the right translation but I want to speak about having having scriptural Authority where God comes in and he and he testifies of of the believer now brother brems isn't me in the way of a true prophet 1962 he says as I was saying the other day someone talking about purgatory and give references to many like st. Francis and st. Cecilia and she praying for certain people and out of purgatory and give such authorities as that that's unscriptural authority it's people who does not have an authority the Apostles had the scriptural authority and if it's contrary to them it's a lie as far as I'm concerned so many people they come and authority of a of a nation you know ambassadors will come and they and the authority of that nation as is backing them up and people come in the authority of a church or some great teaching or some Bible School or but the believer doesn't come in those kind of authorities the believer comes and the authority of the word where the word himself is behind the believer now Jesus was asked this question and it's amazing because here we are a young mark you know they were you know they came to him after he had done incredible miracles he had raised the dead he had come the storm he had done many incredible things and they came to him and saying by what authority do you do these things you know they could see that the authority he had wasn't the authority they had it was an otherworldly Authority they couldn't understand it you know but yet before this Nicodemus came to him by night said Jesus master we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these things unless God be with them so they knew that he was he was more than just in the man with a teaching but this was more than a even a profit I could say but you know this was someone with authority and we know that he had supreme authority he didn't just have a lesser authority but here was the creator himself was made flesh I mean the one who created all things the one who is there to purchase the redemption of his bride was standing upon the earth yeah you know the you know the the promise that had been given in the garden of the scene of the woman was there and he had supreme authority there was no devil that could hold him nothing could withstand him hallelujah I mean he had supreme authority now now Authority just just just the meaning of it if you don't mind me your authority it means the power or right to give orders to make decisions and to enforce obedience and Webster Webster's dictionary would say it's a power to influence or command thought opinion or behavior an authority is also a freedom granted by one in authority hallelujah so you know he had authority and he's given us the same Authority you got to know what's backing you up amen your brother Bram he would say many times about how ministers would come to him out of denominations and they'd say we know what your preaching is the truth but if we begin to preach these things our churches will kick us out our denominations will kick us out so they weren't willing to make the step but he said don't you know Christ as you're backing up I mean you don't need a paycheck you don't need a church to back you up I mean but your authority comes should come from heaven I mean so we have to have I trust we have the UM you know the confidence that Christ is our backing up I mean the word is our backing up I mean if we stand for him he'll stand for you amen so now this word Authority in in the scripture it comes from the Greek word and I probably can't pronounce it even close to or lets me to sound like but it's a excuse eeeh which means a power that means the power of choice that means the power of authority and influence and of a right or a privilege I mean so if you have been given authority if you have scriptural authority then you have a right or privilege given by God to you I mean as as as the Apostle Paul speak about Jesus and the book of Hebrews and he would say you know contrasting the blood of bulls and goats being being not as great as the blood of Jesus Christ he would he would say the blood of Jesus Christ is greater than that of blood of bulls and goats you'd say the priesthood of our Lord Jesus is greater than the high priests you're the natural lineage of of of Levi amen and then he would say for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator so the testator's the one who gives no no there another word for Testament is a will right so the testator is the one who actually writes down the will and then gives it before he dies for a testament is of force after mina did otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liver so he's saying now if the if the man just say for example if I have a will and I'm alive then what's in the will could not be distributed to those who I've named in the will I mean it has no force is no effective and it's just on paper but if I am dead now then someone worth with legal authority has the right to dispense my estate to those who have given it to hallelujah so it's the same thing so there's an authority that's been given I mean like a lawyer has an authority he has a right or she has a right to actually dispense the contents of a will that I would leave so for example if I had a house and I put in my will that the house goes to Annalise within therefore there's now the law is behind that decision that she has to receive the house or if I have a tropical island and it goes to Lilia where has to go to Lilia or Gabriel on my jet plane I don't know but it has to go to them right it has to go to them because there's no Ferdie given to the lawyer to give them the contents of the will that is under their name hallelujah and it's the same thing with us our Lord Jesus now he lifts us with the will I mean he lifts us with with an inheritance right and now there is an authority being given as the Apostle Paul would say a dispensation of the Gospels been committed to me now that dispensation was now he was going to assure the Gentiles this is what's been in the will I mean it was hidden in the mind of God it was hidden in types and shadows in the Old Testament but now I'm gonna I have been given Authority I've been given authority by God because the testator died Jesus Christ died so now the will comes into force I mean but he didn't just die he rose again I mean that his spirit now would distribute that would the contents of the will to the elected ones hallelujah so now here was because God always uses man God God sent the Apostle Paul I mean with a dispensation of of the gospel to to the Gentiles and he would begin to preach and what in what was happening as God was releasing the contents of the will to as the lik people I mean so once once they were dead in trespasses and sins but that was not what was written in the will for them are you following me I mean their inheritance would not be they were dying just and just be destroyed and like a fire but in the end the contents of the will was eternal life for them hallelujah but they had to come to a place where they would hear the word and faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God and they had to hear the word of God they had to work here the contents of the will there was for them hallelujah that's why you come and you hear the message or something and it quickens to your soul like no other word can why because the contents of the will is being distributed to you I mean so part of what's in the inheritance eternal life hallelujah there was one in this day I mean who had Authority Holly he's in Supino he was in Sabino Canyon in there and the sword landed in his hand and then in the brother was wondering what you know he says I was scared of a knife you know cutting people and yo-yo he said he's glad he didn't live back in those days and and and and and the voice said to me angel said it's it's the king sword and he said eyes it like you know dua night people as well no he says but but then the voice said no it's not a king sword it's the Kings sword and the only the King is the word I mean your here's the waiter now and the only sort of the King as the word himself I mean so now the word was placed in the prophets hand I mean so now I'm in the contents of the will that was sealed up and seven seals could be distributed to the predestinated hallelujah are you following me where we have authority remember the Lord has given authority to his bride I mean that she would receive her inheritance in Christ hallelujah because now now after you meet the Lord it's just you're going through a great big arcade of the word saying now what belongs to me I mean I want to see what's in this aisle I want to see what's up on this shelf I mean every I don't just want to walk in the front of the you know you know the front of the wood and say well this is nice I want everything oh and every part of the inheritance is mine by His grace and I want to receive it hallelujah so now otherwise so for a testator as a force a testament as a force after mina did otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth now moses would take the blood of bulls and goats and after he had received the law on Mount Sinai he wrote hey yo yo so so that was already sprinkled he took that blood and he sprinkled the people and the book with that same blood and he'd say this is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you so he said now the blood connected what was in the law to the people amen and we know many know we know that the law was just a policeman that put people in jail amen but if those who actually lived according to the law would receive the promised land there was power in the law to overcome their enemies right it wasn't just to condemn them there was power in that law that they could go and they could take Jericho they could take AI they could conquer all of their inheritance you following me I mean there was power in that law hallelujah so now so now the blood connected them to the law I mean and if they fully serve the Lord God God than through Moses that they fully served him they would possess the land I mean but if they turned and followed idols in then they'd be consumed off the land they had a choice I'd rather just serve the Lord I mean you look at the benefits of serving him I mean so so so he he he sprinkled the book and the people and says this is the blood of the test which God has enjoined unto you so he okay well I'll just read it for it whereupon this is in Hebrews 9 I'm still there 18 whereupon neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the tests in which God hath enjoined unto you so he connected the people in the book together so the contents of the word was was connected by the blood of bulls and goats and those who fully served him possessed what was in the law because remember the purpose of the law coming was that God would dwell among him I mean they would they would live in their inheritance what God predestined for them to receive they would receive it so Manasseh would receive manassas portion Ephraim would receive Ephraim's portion Amen Jojo all the tribes would receive Judah here Benjamin here is the car here you know they would receive their inheritance in the land now that is just under the blood of bulls and goats now so there was an authority given by Moses to connect the people to the book but Moses representing the law could not take the people into the land so now the authority was given to Joshua take the people across Jordan take them take them into their inheritance you know what's the first words that you know you know God would speak to Joshua in the Book of Joshua Moses my servant is dead so we've come from so now God saying I'm turning a corner they've come out of Egypt but this is not the end of the destination now they've got to go in a mincer now brother Brown when he would come and and and the time of the seals was approaching he had a vision of walking he was he said there are two thirds of the way oh you're on their journey towards Jordan hey sure and he said every promise lays over Jordan in the promised land and then so and then and then a hand came down and showed him Joshua one and his commission and he preaches sermon as I was with Moses so I'll be with you so now a time was coming where a church was coming out of the wilderness and was now a time where the bride would go across Jordan and she would possess every promise that's in the land hallelujah I meant there was great victories in the pro you know in the end the wilderness but that's not our final resting place I mean that's just a journey part of the journey but our destination is in the promised land I mean to cross Jordan I mean and gone to the promised land now here we have now I feel like I'm going a bit fast are you following me remember Paul parallels Israel coming out of Egypt and and going into the Promised Land as the journey of the believer you come out of Egypt come out of the world you're justified you're baptized sanctified in the wilderness but then you've got a cross and go into your wrist which is receiving the Holy Ghost I mean so now so now brother Branham would preach a sermon before they're saying about its figure out turning northward and and he would speak about how God would tell Moses you've been going around this mountain in the wilderness long enough they've got turned northward and go over Jordan hallelujah and he said the church has been going round the mountain until the old generation the fighters died off but now here comes another generation raises up that believes the full Word of God they can go on and possess the land hallelujah so now we are living we are we are those people I mean we're not looking for another church age to come we're not looking for other people to come I mean oh it's us that will cross Jordan and I believe most of us have crossed Jordan I mean where were what do you mean by crossing Jordan crossing Jordan as as death to self I mean were you died out to your ambitions your hopes your plans everything you are I mean you fully surrender everything you die to yourself I mean and the word takes you across Jordan and to the promised land hallelujah and brother Bram would also say I mean he'd also say that the promised land is the son of man which is the word so you have to have just like you take you take when Jesus was here the first time those that really had an experience with him they went into Christ they received their inheritance so it wasn't just those that were healed or those that that ate the loaves or maybe saw a miracle it wasn't them it was those that went into the upper room those are the ones that receive their inheritance in Christ when they look you know just like Peter said you know Jesus asked him who do men say that I am he says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he said blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this under thee but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it so he he looked beyond the flesh of a man and he saw God he saw God veiled in a body hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I when you can see this message and hear the voice behind the voice and it were I'm glad I'm not caught up in belt buckles and hunting in and their big gallon hats and you know fishing and everything the Prophet did I'm not caught up in his personality oh no that's not why I listen to I I listen to it because God showed me this is me speaking to this generation I mean you've got to hear the voice behind the voice and when you can recognize that it's a scriptural voice I miss the voice that wrote this scripture has spoken in this generation I mean and what is that now that's the son of man revealing himself to you and now that opens our land you that every promise in Christ is in you I mean that you receive it hallelujah well the man would say you know the true new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you where he becomes real to you he reveals himself and hears the word when he when he becomes real to you that is the new birth hallelujah I mean what's happening why Christ has become alive this is no longer just a book you read because you're raised to read it know it becomes a personal love letter it becomes a personal book hallelujah I mean where where wherever you read it's at speaking to you it's no longer stories it becomes a reality it actually becomes a light to your feet hallelujah a lamp unto path because it becomes a personal relationship with you you and him Amen now brother Brown would say in the Misses presuming and he preaches it a few times but he said that the that the believers in the first church they he said he said the day of Pentecost they waited till they had scriptural authority because now they that they had to have something to stand upon when times got tough it wasn't all we've been with Jesus no they had to have scriptural authority jesus knew who he was this is backtrack he says in John he sees in John 5 he says search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and really a more correct way of saying that as ye search the Scriptures for in them ye think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me so he knew that the word spoke of him and that gave him scriptural authority I mean because he knew he was the fulfillment of the scripture I mean he knew he was the fulfillment of the Old Testament here he was so that gave him scriptural authority he didn't come in his own opinion he says the doctrine are teachers not mine it's my father's I mean he says here's another one that bears witness I mean that's my father bears witness of me see he had true scriptural authority hallelujah it's on the day of Pentecost because Jesus says to them in the book of John as my father has sent me so send I you Allu you I mean so now they had to wait until they received scriptural authority he says the day of Pentecost they waited till they had scriptural authority that's right before they claimed anything they know they had it they didn't say well I feel a little sensation they felt it saw it something else they knowed it was there they seen it moving in them working in them talking through them everything it was there they didn't have to presume nothing that was there talking for itself and a man when he is born again of the Spirit of God is the same thing today you don't presume now to presume it means to venture without authority so you're just basically doing a stab in the dark guessing I think I'm there but the believer does not presume I mean the believer doesn't need to presume the believer doesn't need to guess that believer knows they've met him that believer has the experience they know they've met the Lord Jesus Christ so they're not presuming and guessing I think I'm a believer they know they're a believer and because God comes them behind their life and vindicates their life to prove that they have true scriptural authority hallelujah and I'm so glad that you know the bride in these last days remember to have scriptural authority is not to have a good sounding argument I mean it's not to have a bunch of traditions behind you well I go to the oldest church has ever been people look for authority for you know you know generations been in the message or or many years or you know my church has been around forever that doesn't give you scriptural authority I mean it's when God meets you for yourself that gives you scriptural authority that gives you authority to stand upon the word amen and we know also that that if this be so I mean we should have such confidence if God is our backing up as the Apostle Paul would say if God be for us who can be against us nothing can be against us hallelujah now the Apostles had scriptural authority on the day of Pentecost because Jesus told them to tarry injure an in Jerusalem until their endued with power from on high so they didn't wait until why I guess you've been here long enough Andrew should we go out or it's been nine days Peter should we go they said no no no we've got to wait something's got to happen to us it's got to be a reality not just a well if one's happy and here we are for you know do you think it happened no it's got to happen right and then now when when the day of Pentecost was fully come and and that same one that was in Jesus Christ without measure was now in his church the same God he believed was the same God wasn't a different one wasn't a third person it was the person came and dwelt in his church and then so and then and then they were speaking other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance I mean and and the people are saying these men a drunk of new wine and then Peter stood up said he said he said you men of Judea and all that 12 all that dwell at Jerusalem be this known aren't you and hearken to my words we are not drunken as uses you suppose being about the third hour of the day now he's going to go and show some scriptural authority because he's saying this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel he was showing that what you see in front of you is the fulfillment of prophecy I mean this is prophecy being fulfilled holy are not yesterday but today amen and that gave them scriptural authority this was this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and all my handmaids i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I'll show wonders in the heavens above and the signs and the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and audible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved so they were stirred up because this was prophecy being fulfilled I mean they were living out Joel's prophecy and that's why they could stand on the word saying this is that and and they could look at the scribes and Pharisees and they could say shall we serve you or God should we please Mina please God you tell me they were just real simple about it should we please men or please God answer me that question they didn't lead anything pushed him around because they knew God was there backing up I mean it wasn't because someone talked them into it arose it sounded like a nice idea or mommy or daddy did it no they met God I mean they they worse the scripture fulfill for their day they are part of the prophecy I mean and it's the same thing when the when the Bible speaks about a bride let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready and to her it was granted that she be she should be arrayed in yo linen clean and white the righteousness of saints hallelujah we're not looking for that to happen it's happening hallelujah that's happening right now we're in the we're in the midst of it God is calling his bride she's being arrayed and find them and clean and wipe the righteousness of saints hallelujah I mean that's why you know we have to we can we can rest that the scripture is the truth and this message calls us to believe the whole Word of God I mean we don't say well the Apostle Paul that's his opinion there and this is someone's idea here no this is all God's Word it turns our heart because the the Ministry of brother brown Malachi 4 was to turn the hearts of the children back to the father's I mean and they believed the whole Word of God amen they believed the whole Word of God and we're being restored back the original faith of the fathers hallelujah where it's not just all that someone's opinion that's Peters opinion no that's God speaking hallelujah amen so now if we have scripture it's like it's like baptism I heard brother Brown say the other day Jesus never said speak these names over them and immerse them in water in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is here baptized in the name I mean the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean so if you don't do it the scriptural way you have no scriptural authority I mean that the people will receive the Holy Ghost I mean a true birth but if you come according to God's pattern I mean then you can stand on that scriptural authority say Lord I've come according to your word I mean if you have promised me a certain thing I shall receive it hallelujah I mean it's like it yeah you know the scripture says if you draw nigh to me I'll draw nigh to you and if you draw nigh to him with a pure heart he has to draw nigh to you because his word says he will maybe says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises to you your children those that are far off even as many as the Lord our God chuckle hallelujah so parents that have the Holy Ghost they mean that means the promises to your children hallelujah I mean so we can stand on that promise because we have scriptural authority I mean if Peter said it's for those that he's calling and he called me and I answered me fill me with the spirit there for us for my children hallelujah we have something to stand on in this hour it's not shifting sands of man's opinion and as US saith the Lord according to the scripture hallelujah that's why we should have such confidence we have scriptural authority hallelujah the Apostles overcame because of scriptural authority in their day the same thing will happen at the end if that was the first Church the last church would go out the same way hallelujah amen Abraham would Abraham would come to a place where there was fighting and his and his nephew lot was taken prisoner but he had Authority God spoke to him it may not have been written down but God spoke to him this is your land this is your inheritance he felt heir to all things and lot was taken prisoner there was war and he would and he would arm his servants he would arm his servants and he would go get back his nephew because he had scriptural authority this is from possessing all things you say brother Bram I need healing remember if you're in Christ you fallen ear to all things all things all things are yours amen your joint heirs with Christ you've fallen into all promises every divine promises yours hallelujah everything everything not just a little bit everything's yours I mean so I wouldn't sit back and just say well whatever will be will be no David when his child with Bathsheba was dying he was on his face seeking God Amen interceding for it but then when the baby died David washed himself went into the house of God and worshipped because he need God was in control of all things but he didn't just sit back in some fatalistic opinion saying well whatever will be will be if it's predestinated it'll be produced so no he Preston he sought the father's face he saw the Lord's face Lord spare my boy spare my child we should be the same way amen he said brother Barry might need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you've got a right to to say to Satan give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord the possessor of heavens and earth and I'm his heir give it back you taught you took my child you got her mixed up with the wrong boy you took my boy mixture up with the wrong girl I claimed there that's right I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister yes Satan you've took them from God's house and and coax them out there but I'm coming after them I claim them well how do you know I'm an heir of all things I mean it's given to me I'm an heir I can claim everything that God promised me Amy and there you are it's mine how do you get it something you've done no sir it's unmerited gift that God gave us and it's ours it belongs to us Satan cannot have hold it if you go to him and the ax scriptural authoritative word with faith and say it's mine lay it down amen glory I like that Satan you lay it down you took it from me you give it back because I'm serving notice on you I've got the notice written right here on the word heavens and earth will pass away but this notice shall not so I come with this notice to serve on you that Jesus Christ him whatever I ask in the father in his name he'll give it to me if I say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in my heart but believe that what I've said shall come to pass I can have what I've said lay it down that gets them started don't get him started get them running lay it down because I have come with the scriptural authority I'm a believer you get that yes sir yes sir what did he have to do first Abraham in order to do this here to lay his faith upon the solid rock foundation of God's promised word look only thing he had was a little bunch of servants probably a dozen and there was probably a couple of thousand armed men and his men wasn't soldiers they were servants cattleman sheep men herders probably old rusty knives they had picked up somewhere and laid up probably out several rains had fallen on their Mary rusty but Abraham wasn't looking at the rusty knife or the no shield at all he was laying his faith upon God's Word the you are that's what does it that's what how are you gonna fight them when you get there it's not up to me it's up to me to lay my faith on what God says hallelujah and it's the same thing I mean we have a thought I say Satan give it back amen brother bran said and the restoration of the bright tree we have a right to enforce upon Satan I mean we have a right I mean to sing God's holy ghost agent after him I mean what here whatever he is stolen from us we have a right I mean to enforce upon Satan Satan you took my joy give it back you took my peace give it back you took the joy of my salvation give it back I mean you took my health give it back I mean whatever it is give it back Satan you must let go and give it back to me I mean because I am a believer hallelujah it doesn't matter what state you secure and if you're a believer you're a believer even if you're backslidden you're still a believer just repent and move on with God that's what you've got to do it's not your present condition that matters that's what God has done oh yeah you have to take God at His Word wholly and stand upon that word because you have authority I mean you have scriptural authority if you stand upon that word hallelujah we need to take Goddard as worse a people will go on a rapture because they've taken God at His Word hallelujah they'll have their children because they took God at His Word I'll be healed because they took God at His Word hallelujah that's what we've got to do hallelujah it's not your condition that matters take 120 in the upper room there was a woman at the well was there Peter tried to kill a God the sword there's Mary Magdalene Seven Devils were cast out of here all kinds of people were there and didn't matter where they're from but they stood on God's promise when Jesus said tarry in Jerusalem they said yes Lord until you are endued with power from on high yes Lord Halle and they receive the promise hallelujah he says these signs shall follow them that believe yes Lord I have scriptural authority I mean to stand upon that take God at His Word hallelujah what are you gonna do about it amen hallelujah now brother I'm seizing God of this evil age he's speaking about natural life that he goes into spiritual life he says for as the germ of natural life has brought down Dermott eyes from father to father - father - father souls the life of Christ German ties that's the reason God uses Elijah's spirit five different times what is it it's the handing down just as your natural life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father so as the Spirit of God that was pre dear said before the foundation of the world what sit down passed down from generation to generation hallelujah so the same victory that it won in the first generation will be in the next hallelujah if the first generation overcame the second generation will overcome at their same spirit sin and they'll have to overcome because the same God hallelujah that's why he looked through the scripture what is it it's a record of God having victory I mean - think they'll swore in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon his angels that dragon prevailed not was cast down to the earth so they were fighting in him and now he has cast down who chases them down to the earth God comes down holy and God comes down after his enemy hallelujah and then finally there's finally there's Moses he walks into Egypt and the devil recognizes he looks at Moses I say I've seen those eyes before I've seen you before somewhere that's why I tried to kill all the baby boys here and you know you know before Moses was born he's trying to wipe out that deliverer hallelujah so he looks him in the face I've seen this one before hallelujah the emojis has taken off the scene he was a he was a serpent bruiser demon defeated he was a liberator hallelujah God God showed his power there and Moses oh we're not leaving a hoof behind Pharaoh no you're gonna leave some behind no we're not gonna leave some behind and I'm gonna plant your kingdom until you say let them go how many plague the kingdom and play the kingdom he wasn't sidling for anything less hallelujah and they walked out of Egypt with all of their ones hallelujah and then Moses has taken off the scene he comes Joshua as I was with as it was was Moses I'll be with you and then the devil looks at Joshua I've seen that look before what's God veiled God manifesting himself down through the Old Testament he's got trouble hallelujah and then and then finally then finally it goes down through and he makes them all fall in some way because their fallen men then finally God becomes flesh God's encountered in a man and Satan looks at him I've seen this one before I've seen this one before then finally he's hanging on Calvary cry breathe his last breath father into thy hands do I commit my spirit gives up the ghost well Lou yeah and then it's a knock on Hell's door Jesus walks in Satan swings you out of his chair whatever he does so I've got you now I thought I had you when I killed Abel why cuz he sort of look in Abel's eyes I saw I had you when I made Moses have a temper and fail and elijan all those ones the one who cast him out of heaven has now conquered him on earth and now gone down to his own house and conquered him he's been pursued the devil's been pursued down to his own house hallelujah it's the Saints like finally about you now and then and in those same eyes look at them and say oh no you got a real wrong boy I'm in charge now my Bloods on the cross I purchased Adams fall and race all my children I have redeemed and now I've come to enforce my victory upon you give me the keys of hell death and Grave off rip some oversight kicks him back in then he ascends up hallelujah and he goes up to paradise and this and there's a meeting going on hallelujah there's a thief here's the knock not that long before the door opens Daniel looks around Moses looks around Hannah looks around Miriam looks around all the redeemed look around who's this what's your name I'm thief on the cross what did you do did you conquer kingdoms did you cast out Devils what a what's your testimony how did you meet him hallelujah I was hanging on a cross my life was draining out of me I couldn't hold myself up to breathe anymore I looked across the other man we followed him down through the cobble streets hallelujah dr. blood were running off his body crown of thorns was on his head they mocked him so did I do you read it they both mocked them both thieves mocked them I caught up in it so easy to be caught up in what's going on and I mocked him but then I looked again make sure you look again but then I looked again and I saw more than a man I he was might beyond any man but I looked at him I said I said Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom and he looked at me hallelujah it is today you'll be with me in paradise and Here I am where is he hallelujah hello he's coming hallelujah and he goes in the door they start rejoicing and there's another knock and someone else walks in we've been waiting who are you and they look them in the eyes I've seen that look before hallelujah it's not a look of contempt and anger and animosity to look of love here's our Redeemer Adam yes Eve it's the seed of the woman hallelujah I've been waiting hallelujah here here he is Kolya no it's a boys here's the act we got in hallelujah holy Moses as though there's the burning bush holy I saw the back parts of him walking before we would now see him face to face hallelujah he is Here I am wait sir lets us seemed hallelujah a mini the least captivity captive they send on high but it's works not done he wants to Thresh the devil for two thousand years that's a lot of time in the ring boxing doesn't never last that long but then now the devil pie thanks man it's over finally he won't bother me no more the day Pentecost comes it's the hunger and a people the devil may be thinking I don't worry about the end they're a bunch of fanatics know when God stirs God's gonna do something Holly I watch the documentary on the Azusa Street revival that brother James I'm said to go look at there was years of crying out for a revival it didn't just happen like this there was a all of all of LA Los Angeles was under such a grip of revival they're hungry for years hallelujah if you were to hunger just feed that hunger lift up before God Lord I'm hungry I want to see you live oh and I see the God of the Bible manifested me hallelujah and then finally God poured himself out and it changed the world hallelujah amen and then so are these just 120 phonetics in the upper room don't worry about them but they were told Terri hallelujah and then that same God comes down into them then they walk out of the upper room not like this they're shouting like a bunch of drunk people and the devil looks at them and says I've got trouble I've seen that look before I thought he was gone oh he's still here he's still here hallelujah and the devil tried to stop the life he couldn't stop the life he couldn't stop at all even down through the Dark Ages you can see a record of God's supernatural hand hallelujah we take men like like like John Wycliff had a burden in England the Bible must be in the native language had a burden hallelujah his teachings went to bohemia and they influenced john huss and he was a hundred years before Luther had a burden the Bibles could be in their own language he believed virtually the same thing Luther would one hundred years later and before and he stood he came to a place where he was alone to be burnt at the stake all of his friends for sukham but he met someone he met the master in his day he couldn't recant how can you recant once you've met him it's impossible hallelujah and then so but he said in a hundred years a man will stand up with these same things you won't be able to destroy him 100 years later Luther comes the just shall live by faith the Reformation Zahn hallelujah you can see it all the way down through scripture I mean all the way down through history God's children manifesting him in their season hallelujah but that's not the end because finally God would God you know I like you know he saved the best till last hello you have a crescendo why not don't you scoff and I'll have a crescendo hallelujah so God's going to say I'm going to show Satan the power of my blood I'm going to show you devil you know you know devil means tormentor who knows that you know we are the devil's devil we torment him he has no peace because of you holy you mean little old me I just go about my life you torment him because here's a soul he can't get here's one he can't get hallelujah he may sidetrack do whatever but he can't get you he can't snuff that life out he can't destroy the seed hallelujah it means here it come and then God God sends Elijah to the earth why cuz he said Satan I'm going to show you what my blood does more than more than just justification sanctification restoration of the gifts all those things are wonderful now I'm going to show you what happens when I step into a man hallelujah and the angel Commission brother branham if you are sincere and get the people to believe nothing will stand before your prayers not even cancer you think what it'd be like here's a man who's been redeemed he's gonna God just took him and shook her in front of this is what my salvation does and night after night the devil was cast out meeting after meeting sermon after sermon people were delivered cross our children their eyes were fixed cancers were work were destroyed people who were dead there was one woman had he wore dropper than her neighbors cheers been carried up in a prayer lighter thing in Phoenix in the early years she died in the line knowing of cancer she said if I die in this line get me up there she died in the line she came up and she she was brought back to life hallelujah peace peace who's heard that in the state and she's in the meetings he says just ahead of you here you're 15 years ago you died in the line you know and she stands up yep that's true that happened hallelujah meeting after meeting the devil's defeated and the devil's defeated and the devil's defeated because he looks in those eyes and said I've seen that look before I thought I got rid of that look but it's still there hallelujah but then now but then now the prophets taken off the scene because God just doesn't want to show what one man ministry that's not the end of the scripture that's now thou must prophesy again where a bride will take the book take the Testament become one with it and then manifest its speak it forth hallelujah so now it's not just one it's an a mini membered body around the world so the devil goes to every country under heaven I believe they're everywhere these people almost over whose hearts are all aflame and he looks them in the eye mmm I've seen this before I can't burn it out of them I can't boil it out of them I can't I can't bribe it out of them hallelujah and it's a torment that's a torment because he wants control you're like a bully a bully is not happy if there's someone resisting him or her they want to just break everyone and just have them as little puppets dancing around them that's what the devil does that's what he wants to do but these are people in art and I believe I'm looking at them where they don't put up with the bully because they know in whom they have believed hallelujah it's not thee you know it's not it's not us you're like brother and seasoned about a policeman a policeman doesn't have power but he's got authority amen and and Jesus said wait tarry in Jerusalem until you are endued with them with powerful my prompt from on high so the power they received wasn't their own power but they had the authority to get it but they are endued with it and that would and jus means to be like put on a dress put on a garment you'll be clothed and this power just like a policeman he he looks like anyone else he puts on a uniform he's in dude with power not his power sipar of the state parlor and he's got a badge and he can be the smallest little fellow but everything must if he goes out on the street everything's got to stop because of the badge that he has he's got authority to use the power of the state Allu you know that's just a policeman how much more believer I mean you can have a policeman he's got a pulled leg he's not feeling too good but he's a policeman he can be this big after this many donuts he's still a policeman a mint cook he's got authority and if he's a real police he's not afraid to use that authority hallelujah and it's got to be the same thing with you and I we can't be afraid to use our god-given Authority because we have authority over the devil we have authority over sickness we have authority over every spirit that can be named hallelujah why are all of the sermon lines and all the testimonies recorded to show everything that can be named must bow to the name of Jesus Christ and it does doesn't matter what kind of sickness doesn't water doesn't matter what kind of label that man puts on it's a medical term at Muspel it must bow to the name of Jesus Christ it has to cause that name has Authority and where is that name that names and it's great hallelujah it's more than you're saying the name Jesus that's in you hallelujah you ever but you've got to use it Amen you know Moses going into Egypt 80 year-old man goes into the superpower of the world think about that an 80 year old man this is bringing into modern times and your old man walks into the Senate and in America we're having a full full house of representative yard there's a joint house session going on in there and the president's there and your old man walks in let my people go that's ridiculous one you know what not even poly some other old senator could grab him and chuck him out like Moses he had nothing you know one spear brother brother brems he could have finished the whole thing won't go with a speaker to just stab Moses he would have died but there was an unseen Authority where he had a right to go into a throne room of a man who thought he was a god and he could say let my people go I'm not here to negotiate I'm not here do whatever you got to let them go he had authority and he did exactly what he was commissioned to do Amen he wasn't you know and it's going to be the same thing with you and I we have that same Commission let my people go hallelujah I won't wait for someone else to do it no gods waiting for you that same God that was in you're the same god those are Moses's in you hallelujah the same one that's in Jesus than you the same one and the prophets and you if you have the Holy Ghost hallelujah so go forth of the power of thy might Aliyah amen Christ is our backing up we have authority we have god-given Authority now we can't sit back I'm I'm done okay but we have scriptural authority don't need nothing push you around amen they had scriptural authority because they met the god of the scripture amen and the God that went that sent them went in them to do what they are called to do hallelujah we're in the same category amen we have scriptural authority I'm being tormented by something you have authority to put that under your feet the devil has to obey your voice it's amazing you know God God basically you know you know God told Satan you're gonna burn Satan and he looks at him basis is no I'm not no I'm not I'm gonna make these I'm gonna make your people that you've made I'm going to make them dance to my tune and he's gonna and and and he produced the fall to give us a fall of nature that we have to dance to his tune but that's not the end of the story so he cursed humanity thinking we're under his puppet strings but then God takes the same humanity doesn't change the bodies they're born but redeems their souls give them a new spirit he comes and dwells in them I mean and in the same lips that we use for cursing now cast the devil out the same with the same lips that glorified Satan now cast them out I mean the same ones that said I got I don't want nothing to have just they say I love you Jesus I Love You Lord you're wonderful the same one who didn't care now cares hallelujah and it's a god thanks you and by his blood transforms you to tear the devil's Kingdom down hallelujah hallelujah and that's why we're here friends went on here to be pushed around by the devil way to push him around I mean he has to obey the voice of the redeemed hallelujah so I just take God at His Word say well yes you say Satan's on my case no no you're on Satan's case he's trying to bully you back into submission be say none another we're done Satan you are not the head Christ is my head and he said he you're going to be under my feets again in your place boy get under my feet right now in the name of Jesus Christ the devil has to obey you hallelujah we've been made more than conquerors overcomers in this life Alleluia the friends we have scriptural authority take your authority and use your authority I mean if we're seated in heavenly places you'll use that authority if you're seated there you business you have to use it amen but don't be afraid imagine imagine you take president Trump imagine if he so he's just like any other man then he gets elected into office the day before he's elected he can't start a nuclear war he has no authority he has no authority just being a private citizen of the United States of America though he's very wealthy man but then he's made president he can start a war he can destroy the world cuz he has the authority amen what is the use of being in an office and not using that office what is the use what is the use of him being president obviously he he ran for president cuz he had something in his mind he wanted to achieve and God is in control of everything so it doesn't matter what we think about him he's at all in God's hand like anyone else the book of Revelation says that God puts it in the heart of them to fulfill his word and they may not be aware of it God is in control of all things nothing's out of cater right but what is the good of him not using his presidential authority to do what he wants to do based on his office hallelujah that's just a fallen man in a fallen office how much more the redeemed the Bride of Christ amen still was afraid to use her god-given authority to go before the king to save her people she was afraid but that was the authority she had she had a right to gone before the king and it was the king that executed her vengeance upon Haman wasn't her doing it she didn't have any guards she didn't have any army it was the Kings but she had to come to her place recognize I have a Queen's crown on my head and I didn't there's not some cheap thing that I just bought in a store this is the real one she had Queen Authority she had the robes on she woke up at the palace she had to step out and take her position and use her position according to what she needed I mean she couldn't wait on the King to do it she couldn't Warrick I couldn't do it only she could do it what about you what about you we shouldn't be afraid to step out oh but I've been the devil's beating me down for too long as brother Qadri preached here two years ago or three to be continued that's not the end of the chapter there's not the end of the story the devil's on my case to be continued I've been through a rough patch to be continued holy that's not the end of the story the end of the story says I danced on streets of gold the devil's burning and no more that's the end of the book so whatever happens went here and there I'm going to end up there he's going to end up down there hallelujah we have some musicians please they stake out god-given Authority and use it the devil says boo just say boo boo amen don't be intimidated by his lies their lies they stand shall we we have scriptural
