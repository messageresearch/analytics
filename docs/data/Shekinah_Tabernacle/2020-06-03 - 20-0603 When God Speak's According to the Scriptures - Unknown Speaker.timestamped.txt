[26:44] [Music]
[27:02] praise the Lord this song is only two
[27:05] days old I wrote it on Monday and the
[27:09] Lord is so good you know I suppose about
[27:12] maybe 2017 I wrote a song and I said
[27:15] lord I don't want to write any more it
[27:17] means trials you know and yeah after
[27:20] that was the biggest trial so I said
[27:23] another song this song here before the
[27:30] lockdown sister Christine asked me have
[27:33] you are you writing another song and I
[27:34] said yes actually I do
[27:36] and she asked what's it called I said
[27:39] let God live and that's all I had was
[27:42] just the title so two months later I
[27:45] know the word has been so good so part
[27:51] of it is just you know I was thinking
[27:52] about shame girl is better being had
[27:54] been preaching about and how he got to
[27:58] recognize who he is the circumstance
[28:01] hasn't changed it's the same but it's
[28:03] something in his thinking changed and
[28:06] when I wrote this and basically it just
[28:10] came there was one line missing as it
[28:12] kept praying note what is this one mine
[28:14] and it was the greatest battle ever
[28:17] fought and that's where it is it's it's
[28:21] he also administered about the Barrow
[28:24] field is is where it's a no-man's land
[28:27] but that's where the enemy is being
[28:29] defeated and so face the Lord after that
[28:32] you see no enemy no more he's yeah you
[28:35] know like Moses and him they saw their
[28:36] enemy no more so yeah and in one line he
[28:40] says when the enemy surrounds me like a
[28:43] flood the Lord will raise up a standard
[28:44] I had to try and find where was the
[28:46] scripture and it's
[28:48] Isaiah 59 right at the end I was so
[28:51] pleased reading it and then the very
[28:53] next chapters as is 60 races arised you
[28:57] know it and shine the light has come
[28:59] yeah I was just having such a good time
[29:01] so other words there I was that was
[29:11] funny
[29:25] there are times of trouble and despair
[29:29] so many burdens to bear but I learned to
[29:36] put my trust in God and let God live let
[29:45] God live let him live in me let God lead
[29:52] having the victory I open my
[29:56] to the things of God and let God live in
[30:04] the greatest battle ever for the enemy

[30:14] the Lord raise a stand
[30:18] and let God let God let him live in me

[45:54] if it's off yourself you know it's just
[45:57] somebody trying to sing a song but I
[46:01] like to start reading first Corinthians
[46:05] chapter 15 this is one to six Bible says
[46:13] here moreover brethren I declare unto
[46:16] you the gospel which I preached unto you
[46:19] which also ye have received and wherein
[46:22] ye stand by which also ye are saved if
[46:27] you keep the men in memory what I
[46:30] preached unto you unless ye have
[46:32] believed in vain for I delivered unto
[46:35] you first of all that which I also
[46:38] received how that Christ died for our
[46:42] sins according to the scriptures and
[46:45] that he was buried and that he rose
[46:49] again the third day according to the
[46:53] scriptures and that he was seen of
[46:56] Cephas then of the twelve after that he
[47:00] was seen of above five hundred brethren
[47:03] at once of whom the greater part remain
[47:06] unto this prison but some are fallen
[47:10] asleep is that wonderful here is Paul
[47:15] preaching and said I only give you what
[47:17] I have received you know you may be
[47:21] seated
[47:21] you know I can only give what I have
[47:25] received I've had people telling me what
[47:28] to preach you won't believe it tell me
[47:31] we should preach this and you should
[47:33] preach that and you I only preach what I
[47:38] have received
[47:39] so I can only give what I received you
[47:43] remember Jesus was feeding the 5000 and
[47:48] some air to breathe basking and some hid
[47:50] fish well I can't give you a fish I've
[47:54] got the braid here but both was to give
[47:57] you life you know both was ordained by
[47:59] the Lord but what I'm trying to point
[48:02] out here in these scriptures poses I
[48:05] delivered unto you first of all that
[48:07] which I also received what that how the
[48:13] Christ died for our sins you know we
[48:18] can't just stop there he died for our
[48:21] sins according to the scriptures that is
[48:26] the point
[48:27] it's got to be according to the word you
[48:30] know devil wanted him to jump off the
[48:32] cliff if he would have done that and if
[48:35] he would have broken his neck there
[48:36] would be no salvation because it would
[48:39] not have been according to the scripture
[48:40] so whatever we do it's got to be
[48:43] according to the scripture and how can
[48:45] you live according to Scripture and less
[48:47] it's given to you you cannot live
[48:50] according to scripture if other people
[48:52] tell you what to do and how to do it
[48:53] just imagine we have a love relationship
[49:00] with Jesus Christ you believe that now
[49:04] if you ever love a relationship you
[49:07] don't need two people people tell you
[49:09] how to love you beloved I don't need to
[49:13] God tell me brother Isaac you know or
[49:16] you should you know sister Shannon you
[49:18] should do this and you should you know
[49:21] Gmail they like to be tickled on a photo
[49:24] oh yeah no nonsense how would I know you
[49:28] have a relationship with him so the only
[49:31] way you can actually fulfill the
[49:33] scripture is if you do what he tells you
[49:37] to do it not what anybody tells you I
[49:40] mean it's greatly we have a fivefold
[49:42] ministry according to the Word of God
[49:44] there's many many good preachers and
[49:48] ministers but they can only edify you
[49:52] too
[49:53] more in love with him you know that's
[49:55] that's really what did this so I like
[49:59] that idea
[50:00] so he says how he died for our sins
[50:03] according to scriptures because he died
[50:07] according to scriptures what happened
[50:09] that he was buried and he rose again the
[50:13] third day according to the scriptures
[50:14] you know he knew I'm fulfilling the Word
[50:21] of God I'm dying here according to
[50:25] scripture and I will rise again a third
[50:28] day that's what the scripture says there
[50:31] was no doubt even death could not scare
[50:34] you away from the Word of God so when
[50:37] you get a hold of these things you're
[50:41] not easily shaken you know your anchor
[50:44] holds your anchor holds and you're not
[50:48] anchored just in some some well-meaning
[50:53] whatever is preached or some church
[50:56] denomination your anchor in Christ in
[50:59] His Word and then you know he will not
[51:03] let you down you know we sometimes get
[51:07] tested and we see the hand of God not
[51:13] always instantly the way when we want to
[51:15] see it in his time sometimes it's
[51:20] instant and sometimes it's down the
[51:23] track I remember a time at a young
[51:27] family only two children and I let
[51:30] myself out into I quit my job and went
[51:34] studying and did all these different
[51:36] things and ended up with not enough
[51:39] money so what do you do you count
[51:46] I had given $135 a week student
[51:51] allowance there ain't alone $140 a week
[51:55] how do we eat how do we fund the other
[51:58] five dollars and all these different
[52:00] things and then you know when you
[52:02] struggle like this
[52:05] you get well-meaning people to rub it in
[52:09] you know there was foolish to leave a
[52:12] job having a young family including a
[52:15] good job just to go studying how would
[52:18] they know what's gone through my mind
[52:20] how would they know what I experienced
[52:23] say was you how will people know what
[52:26] are you going through unless the little
[52:28] Josie I was talking to a brother tonight
[52:32] I sit on the phone I said you know he's
[52:36] often misunderstood and others and
[52:38] misunderstood and he misunderstands I
[52:41] said look people have such limited
[52:43] horizon they don't know what you've been
[52:48] through they don't know yeah you know
[52:52] what what jobs he had people were high
[52:56] up here or down low they're not that it
[52:59] matters but they haven't got a clue and
[53:01] you cannot explain say if you make a
[53:04] decision or do a certain thing in a few
[53:07] words because you will have to explain
[53:10] your entire life you have to explain
[53:13] your entire thought pattern you have to
[53:15] explain all the things to look minister
[53:18] to you you can't do it that's why we
[53:20] need to trust love one another as we are
[53:23] you see there's a lot of people I don't
[53:26] understand why are they doing this you
[53:28] know that's stupid or foolish but hey I
[53:31] don't know where which way this comes
[53:34] through as long we walk in the same
[53:38] direction that's important so as we are
[53:43] including Christ he is our absolute we
[53:46] know Paul had an absolute that was his
[53:48] experience on the way to Damascus he
[53:51] never looked back he always mentioned it
[53:53] and he knew Christ is alive because he
[53:56] heard from him personally once it
[53:59] happens in your life nobody can drag you
[54:01] away from it in other way the hundred
[54:03] horses know nothing and but people try
[54:08] don't think it people don't try but you
[54:12] see that the Bible says my sheep will
[54:16] hear my voice
[54:17] and as strange as it will not follow so
[54:21] we know what God speaks to us you know
[54:25] when God first speaks to you not when
[54:29] you end up in in a good church when you
[54:33] still in a world he calls you out
[54:36] he calls the lost sheep he calls you out
[54:38] you know something I've had people that
[54:41] kind of been the Lord because you
[54:42] weren't in a message they know you were
[54:44] this whole listen to nothing to do with
[54:47] it
[54:47] you're either his or not his and if he
[54:50] calls he his voice then you respond to
[54:54] it and then you hear it again and then
[54:57] you hear it again and then here again
[54:58] and it draws you into that place where
[55:01] you come behind the vial into Christ it
[55:05] leads you there so what I'm trying to
[55:07] encourage you this evening respond to
[55:11] that inner voice some twenty seven eight
[55:15] I just read you that it says here twenty
[55:22] seven eight so lovely verse it says when
[55:29] thou sittest seek ye my face my heart
[55:35] said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek
[55:38] when thou sittest who the Lord when he
[55:45] speaks you know sometimes as a sit some
[55:48] of those people speak may and speak but
[55:51] wasn't the Lord speaking to you you can
[55:53] say whatever speech Suman
[55:54] always good word there was a good word I
[55:58] whatever was a good word what's a God
[56:02] speaking or was it man speaking and if
[56:04] God speaks and you heart responds
[56:07] because it speaks to your heart you know
[56:11] it so much if it is there's so much
[56:16] going on speaking to the intellect to
[56:20] the mind we can chew it up and work it
[56:23] out lay it out print it out yeah you
[56:28] know
[56:29] but has its spoken inside what happens
[56:34] when it speaks inside say what happens
[56:36] there will be a manifestation God is not
[56:41] just speaking words in vain he says my
[56:44] word will not return void so there is to
[56:48] be a manifestation of what God speaks to
[56:51] us so when God speaks to you as I said
[56:55] there's a lot of hindrances from you
[56:57] doing what he says I mean it can go into
[57:00] a very real little thing I know I'm not
[57:05] supposed to take my wife as an example
[57:09] but we've had meetings she said at home
[57:12] oh I felt like jumping up and say price
[57:15] the Lord I said why didn't you do it who
[57:18] told you that
[57:19] the Holy Spirit or the devil you know
[57:22] and if it's the Lord putting on your
[57:25] heart it's job Bob would say praise the
[57:27] Lord just do it
[57:29] we're no brother you know in the middle
[57:31] of preaching he used to come forward and
[57:33] kneel down you know fine that's the way
[57:37] it feels right do it do it
[57:40] yeah yeah you know it's so important to
[57:44] realize it's an individual walk if each
[57:47] one place is part then we function
[57:51] tonight
[57:53] I mean these paths sometimes change
[57:55] tonight um
[57:57] maybe say if we talk about the clock I'm
[58:01] the clock face tonight a saint in the
[58:04] front you look at me you know yeah
[58:07] quarter past 9:00 you know what I mean
[58:10] but inside there's many little gears
[58:14] ticking and going and if one misses out
[58:17] you haven't got the right time but if
[58:20] you want to know what the right time is
[58:22] we'll play our part I think it's
[58:24] wonderful so I never despise the least
[58:29] of anything because there's no such
[58:32] thing in the household of God even the
[58:36] least the Bible says in the kingdom of
[58:38] God is greater in John the Baptist
[58:41] even the least well that's a good one
[58:46] isn't it so we just read some twenty
[58:51] seven eight he speaks we here in the
[58:56] heart
[58:56] man speaks we're here about it with
[58:59] Rosie yes barber says in I think in
[59:05] regulations 322 somewhere he that has an
[59:08] ear let him hear what the Spirit says to
[59:10] the churches
[59:12] he that has near not that one this one
[59:15] in here you know it many people read
[59:18] that and and read the book of Revelation
[59:21] hasn't got a clue what it is doesn't
[59:24] speak to them that ever naturally and
[59:27] then you get all these different
[59:29] interpretations and ideas but we have an
[59:32] inner ear and we have the ability to
[59:35] hear him so when you hear him respond
[59:39] with you heart if he uh I don't know if
[59:45] we should say that there was a brother
[59:47] lovely brother his where he came from
[59:51] South Africa he was talking about the
[59:57] meetings they had and Holy Ghost moving
[59:59] in South Africa you know and one day the
[1:00:01] Holy Ghost came down in a meeting so
[1:00:04] much he started shout hallelujah
[1:00:06] hallelujah let's March and the whole
[1:00:09] congregation walked behind him that the
[1:00:11] hallelujah March around the church
[1:00:13] inside the church outside the church
[1:00:16] down the street back to the church
[1:00:18] everybody was rejoicing there was God he
[1:00:25] came to New Zealand once when he was old
[1:00:28] and he preached and he was longing for
[1:00:33] it hallelujah much and he forced the
[1:00:36] people to join him for the hallelujah
[1:00:39] March but I'd say what it's more like a
[1:00:41] funeral march to me huzzah hallelujah
[1:00:44] March feel okay but you better you know
[1:00:47] he said you know you know when the
[1:00:49] spirit calls then is there we don't have
[1:00:53] to live on
[1:00:55] all the annoying thing the anointing is
[1:00:56] new every morning you see it's what has
[1:01:01] been anointed before it's day three
[1:01:03] anointed but there's a new anointing all
[1:01:06] the time so we don't need to worry about
[1:01:09] and try to resurrect some old experience
[1:01:13] let's have a new one
[1:01:15] I tell the new one is amen so my heart
[1:01:20] says because you know I have a ear in
[1:01:24] here so now I'd like to tell you
[1:01:30] something on that line too you know we
[1:01:34] can't hear a lot of things and a lot of
[1:01:37] good things but it's different than when
[1:01:40] it speaks to your heart if you know what
[1:01:42] God's it's something you know it'll come
[1:01:44] to pass you know I was in trouble once
[1:01:50] financially very very much and then the
[1:01:56] Lord spoke to my heart I said oh well
[1:02:00] all will come good oh there's still no
[1:02:03] money in the bank no nothing but I was
[1:02:05] hundred percent at peace you know you
[1:02:10] can imagine when you're young family he
[1:02:12] tries to make a living you might like to
[1:02:14] you know do all these things and build a
[1:02:17] house so save up for something and
[1:02:19] whatever it is and it's so difficult and
[1:02:23] then you come to a place where you start
[1:02:25] to try hard you know I mean I try to
[1:02:29] lose my mind
[1:02:30] maybe I should go and study and have
[1:02:34] another trade on top of this and the
[1:02:37] other and it just didn't work there was
[1:02:39] my efforts my doing and it cost me to
[1:02:44] get stressed I don't know if you had the
[1:02:48] experience trace anybody but you know it
[1:02:52] stress is not the portion of a son of
[1:02:54] God or a daughter of God the pressure
[1:02:57] comes don't get me wrong but we have a
[1:03:01] peace that passes all understanding
[1:03:03] that is our portion and the devil estate
[1:03:07] - Robert away from you and you know I
[1:03:10] was I was so desperate
[1:03:14] there our Lord it's not right as I'm so
[1:03:17] stressed and worked up that's not the
[1:03:20] peace that passes all understanding
[1:03:21] where is it and then a prize at Lord if
[1:03:25] I've done anything wrong show me show me
[1:03:28] I want to put it right I want to repeat
[1:03:30] but couldn't see anything I prayed a few
[1:03:33] times
[1:03:34] there's about three weeks later I was in
[1:03:38] the middle of prayer Lord what is it
[1:03:41] show me where to repent you know what he
[1:03:44] said to me in here I didn't hear an
[1:03:48] audible I heard in my heart
[1:03:50] he said not your planes my planes man
[1:03:56] that settle it I was a piece in the
[1:03:59] middle of the prayer I had such
[1:04:01] wonderful planes honestly not evil
[1:04:04] planes for the family so we were gonna
[1:04:07] do this we're gonna do that and then you
[1:04:10] know children will have this and no bear
[1:04:13] planes but there were my planes and then
[1:04:16] I repented of my planes and that piece
[1:04:20] was the instantly and I could say all's
[1:04:24] well and all turned out well you see
[1:04:28] sometimes you just have to go back to
[1:04:32] the word you stressed you worked up it's
[1:04:36] not the peace that passes all
[1:04:37] understanding hey something's gone wrong
[1:04:39] somewhere it's not our portion to do to
[1:04:43] be like the willed up and down and in
[1:04:45] and out and all about but I know it's
[1:04:49] easy to talk in retrospect you know when
[1:04:53] you've gone through you look better
[1:04:55] well I could have hit it over earlier
[1:04:57] you know I didn't need to go through all
[1:05:00] this there was a time I lived in a bush
[1:05:03] for four and a half months like a hermit
[1:05:05] to become more holy yeah well we go
[1:05:09] through these things but I tell you what
[1:05:12] that kind of holiness is not accepted up
[1:05:15] there only Christ told
[1:05:17] I seen you so I'm holy because my faith
[1:05:21] in Jesus Christ I know because I live in
[1:05:24] a bush like a hermit and deprived myself
[1:05:26] of any pleasure I nearly died out there
[1:05:31] but you see that's my own doing my own
[1:05:34] doing that look we do things we do
[1:05:39] things made me jealous
[1:05:43] young I once pulled the visitor out of
[1:05:48] bed at 3:00 in the morning as a kid out
[1:05:49] of my house I don't want an evil spirit
[1:05:51] you know I wouldn't do that today
[1:05:54] I wouldn't go and pull a visit the wrath
[1:05:56] of the beat yeah you know that's in you
[1:06:00] zealous wizened and things but when you
[1:06:03] start to realize according to the world
[1:06:06] there's a word for me to fulfill you may
[1:06:10] have a different one you may have
[1:06:11] something else the Lord lies on that you
[1:06:14] had but respond to what he ministers to
[1:06:17] your heart you know I was there himself
[1:06:21] last week and saving a few hotels or
[1:06:25] motels and I was watching some Christian
[1:06:28] preaching you know they had Christian
[1:06:31] channels on the TV so watch them mayor
[1:06:36] of interest and you know they all said
[1:06:40] good things but you know one would try
[1:06:44] to sway you over here the other one I
[1:06:46] want to sway over there but I would be
[1:06:49] drawn to Christ I don't want to be drawn
[1:06:52] to the particular church you know wonder
[1:06:56] what's lying it out was quotes and with
[1:06:59] with what he call it that scriptures
[1:07:03] here the mark of the beast he worship on
[1:07:08] a Sunday
[1:07:09] wonder what mark we have worshiping on
[1:07:12] Wednesday night you know I've been here
[1:07:14] the seal of God keeping the Sabbath of
[1:07:17] course there would have been the
[1:07:19] seventh-day Adventist outfit they sell
[1:07:22] of good things but you know then they
[1:07:25] bring scriptures in argument and it all
[1:07:27] speaks to here never speaks to the heart
[1:07:30] you know and
[1:07:31] you start to chew it up and alright what
[1:07:34] about we have meetings on that Saturday
[1:07:36] instead of Sunday neither here nor there
[1:07:38] really no when it speaks Tiahrt look one
[1:07:42] day with the Lord is like any other day
[1:07:43] in Christ we have the true Sabbath we
[1:07:48] have entered into the rest
[1:07:49] they haven't even by keeping the Sabbath
[1:07:52] you know you know we know that the seal
[1:07:54] of God we are sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:07:57] and responding to be under the the seal
[1:08:00] of the Holy Ghost we will know come
[1:08:02] under the log of the base I mean it's
[1:08:04] quite simple but it's got to speak to
[1:08:07] you house but you know when you just
[1:08:09] chew it up in here it could sway you a
[1:08:12] bit of one side or the other then I
[1:08:15] heard another preacher another channel
[1:08:19] didn't listen too long on the other one
[1:08:21] but and he was talking about lower and
[1:08:25] grace it was really good and one thing
[1:08:29] stood out to me I like to see that he
[1:08:31] said Bible says cursed is the man who
[1:08:36] does not keep all of the law well that
[1:08:41] does away with any of our own trying to
[1:08:46] keep the law including you know whatever
[1:08:51] we might try to do though we sure that
[1:08:53] we shouldn't and keep this you know if
[1:08:57] I'm in church every Sunday 15 minutes
[1:09:00] really I'm fine with God and then one
[1:09:02] day I'm sleeping and be a bit light and
[1:09:05] then I'm condemned no only if he live by
[1:09:09] the law but anyway it's sort of there's
[1:09:13] always good things everywhere but it's
[1:09:15] good to speak to the heart but we had a
[1:09:19] brother in church he's not in church now
[1:09:21] but he's taking this being under grace
[1:09:28] to the other extreme he drinks he smokes
[1:09:33] he swears you would never guess he's a
[1:09:35] Christian well I know I'm the Lord you
[1:09:38] know predestinated you know elected and
[1:09:42] I'm the Lord's but then
[1:09:44] is that according to the scripture
[1:09:47] scripture says shall we we avoid in sin
[1:09:52] that grace may abound god forbid and if
[1:09:57] that sword comes you say God's a bit
[1:10:00] then you're according to the word God's
[1:10:03] a bit yeah you know it's it's such a
[1:10:06] trap when we intellectually try to work
[1:10:11] it out
[1:10:12] look all it comes down to a love
[1:10:16] relationship between you and the Lord
[1:10:19] Jesus Christ our love relationship and
[1:10:23] he is the one that understands you
[1:10:26] nobody else can understand what you've
[1:10:29] been through what he lady is through
[1:10:31] every thought pattern everything nobody
[1:10:34] else would know he knows that's why he
[1:10:37] is the great comforter if you need
[1:10:42] comfort though the Lord yeah you know
[1:10:46] main you see sympathy but in sympathy is
[1:10:50] no victory true comfort comes from the
[1:10:54] Holy Spirit from God himself and so
[1:10:58] often we seek comfort from other people
[1:11:00] you know it's it's nice to to comfort
[1:11:04] one another the spargle says with these
[1:11:06] words that you know that would be
[1:11:11] changed in a twinkling of an eye comes
[1:11:13] with one in other words these words was
[1:11:15] the Word of God not with oh yeah I've
[1:11:18] been through debt to you know heart just
[1:11:20] as well you you still can walk and you
[1:11:23] know even with crutches and you know
[1:11:25] that that's not very good comfort but it
[1:11:30] happens it happens so we go straight to
[1:11:35] Christ I had an email her several emails
[1:11:41] from a main from Kenya Muslim main and
[1:11:47] he said please Lee help me to be saved
[1:11:55] or whatever he said something like that
[1:11:58] in English but anyway first I ignored it
[1:12:02] and then dinner so you never know it
[1:12:04] might be genuine or maybe not so I wrote
[1:12:07] to him I said look don't look to men
[1:12:09] look to Christ he's your mediator you
[1:12:12] can go directly to him and then he wrote
[1:12:15] back out you know he was surprised he
[1:12:18] sort of had must be saved through you
[1:12:20] that's what he wrote you see so cut a
[1:12:23] long story short he was kept on writing
[1:12:27] asking questions and I wrote I wrote
[1:12:29] back to him and then I told him about
[1:12:35] you know the first step is to repentance
[1:12:39] you know I traced the Lord directly with
[1:12:42] your own words and then I sort of
[1:12:45] basically wrote the sinner's prayer down
[1:12:48] in some formal way got another email he
[1:12:51] said the other night my family and I we
[1:12:55] we used your prayer and then a presence
[1:12:59] came in the room and now he got 10
[1:13:02] people from the mosque come and
[1:13:05] fellowship with him too and then he
[1:13:07] asked me about different things that
[1:13:10] wrote him about baptism a whole big page
[1:13:13] and he wrote back he understands baptism
[1:13:17] now he said he's taking all the tin from
[1:13:20] the mosque and the river to baptize you
[1:13:22] know do they hear from the heart or from
[1:13:26] the mind but what what I thought it's so
[1:13:30] easy people who are open the Lord leads
[1:13:35] them thus far he wants to lead him on
[1:13:37] the same way you know I said to him how
[1:13:41] did he find me oh he was looking on the
[1:13:44] online Bible and my name came up I don't
[1:13:47] know how my name came up but that you
[1:13:53] see to me it's so easy somebody gets
[1:13:58] ahold of a person like that and weighs
[1:14:01] him over here with intellectual
[1:14:03] understandings and things well-meaning
[1:14:05] people here again be yourself be
[1:14:11] yourself
[1:14:12] don't take somebody else's place be
[1:14:14] yourself it's so lovely when you see a
[1:14:16] person being themselves
[1:14:19] and it's so obvious when a person tries
[1:14:23] to be somebody else or copy somebody you
[1:14:27] know it's as I said people like you to
[1:14:31] conform to this so say it this way I be
[1:14:34] it that way but that's not the way it is
[1:14:36] but we want the Holy Ghost in our own
[1:14:38] lives in everything we do and say so
[1:14:43] hearing was the spiritual ear same
[1:14:48] hearing the message with a spiritual ear
[1:14:50] there's many people they hear the
[1:14:52] message with an intellectually and then
[1:14:56] you get all sorts of things but if it's
[1:14:59] spiritual ear well you know it's there
[1:15:06] is one bright room and there is a big
[1:15:11] pride collectively but there's a
[1:15:14] relationship individually never forget
[1:15:18] there but he might minister to you may
[1:15:20] not minister not fun but when he
[1:15:22] receives something from him
[1:15:26] to edify the church then it will be a
[1:15:30] blessing otherwise it's not from him or
[1:15:34] it's maybe something personal to you
[1:15:36] I've hid something personal to me and so
[1:15:38] I don't want to share it tonight
[1:15:40] it was personally to me and but I don't
[1:15:45] want to share things like that but you
[1:15:47] know Bible says we talk about according
[1:15:50] to the wood
[1:15:51] it says old men dream dreams you know
[1:15:56] I'm getting that way so I'm getting
[1:15:58] dreams but you see the dreams got to be
[1:16:02] according to the word and not just an
[1:16:05] old man rattling on for hours telling
[1:16:08] all that but he dreamed last night and
[1:16:10] nobody knows what he's talking about
[1:16:11] that happens that happens you see but
[1:16:14] that's not according to the world but I
[1:16:17] was troubled I say that again
[1:16:21] years ago because I was confronted with
[1:16:27] what'd he call that mental understanding
[1:16:30] of the message especially the token what
[1:16:35] is the token you know the token is the
[1:16:38] word
[1:16:39] I thought the token was the Holy Ghost
[1:16:41] you know and I was sort of thinking and
[1:16:44] battling and another one I wished her
[1:16:47] brother brain won't be here and I could
[1:16:49] just ask him do you know what happened I
[1:16:53] had a dream in the dream there was a bar
[1:16:58] and was sitting on the barstool and next
[1:17:02] to me said brother Brennan he had such
[1:17:07] an expression in his eyes and and such a
[1:17:10] sweetness you can't describe it it was
[1:17:13] wonderful like looking at the Lord's in
[1:17:15] the Saints anyway I started to cry in a
[1:17:21] dream and I said look I'm crying because
[1:17:25] because of the grace God chose me I said
[1:17:29] you've already gone on and now he asked
[1:17:32] me to talk to you now here we come back
[1:17:35] to speaking to the heart not a single
[1:17:39] word was spoken
[1:17:41] everything was conveyed he looked at me
[1:17:45] and I said you know I want to know about
[1:17:49] the token and then that sweet
[1:17:51] understanding smile can I know what you
[1:17:55] mean you know I know exactly a house
[1:17:57] feel and then he took a lump of ice
[1:18:03] there was a lump of ice he held it over
[1:18:08] a bottle it slowly melted and dripped
[1:18:11] into the bottle now I knew straight away
[1:18:15] I had my answer well if I want to say it
[1:18:20] philosophically you know the lump of ice
[1:18:24] is the word in the hands of a prophet
[1:18:28] you start to understand it it becomes a
[1:18:33] different form the same word it wholly
[1:18:36] goes
[1:18:36] water dripping into
[1:18:39] the vessel and that's the way it is and
[1:18:42] look I was so happy when I woke up I
[1:18:46] never left me that dream because it is
[1:18:49] so true here is the lump of ice that's
[1:18:54] the lump of ice it's the Word of God but
[1:18:57] how'd you get it in here I knew of a
[1:19:01] woman she actually literally ate spoken
[1:19:04] books I don't know if she got any ink
[1:19:08] poisoning or not but that's
[1:19:11] misunderstanding it that has been
[1:19:14] written by the Holy Spirit so it's only
[1:19:17] the Holy Spirit important in here and
[1:19:19] you know when you see these things it's
[1:19:21] so wonderful
[1:19:22] I just want to say one more thing about
[1:19:25] the relationship you know love
[1:19:29] relationship okay just give you one more
[1:19:33] dream no too short once if it doesn't
[1:19:38] edify you let me know send me an email -
[1:19:41] no that's a load of rubbish and then I
[1:19:43] share them anymore but another one was
[1:19:45] just recently I was in the situation and
[1:19:49] I sue myself
[1:19:51] kind of harsh - it's my wife or or like
[1:19:57] legalistic in a sense it wasn't me but I
[1:20:01] was there as a representation of husband
[1:20:05] wife bride and bridegroom but it wasn't
[1:20:09] me and then you have to do this you have
[1:20:12] to do that you have to submit but
[1:20:14] whatever came or you know you can't wear
[1:20:16] this kind of clothes or whatever it was
[1:20:19] your sleeves are too short you know
[1:20:22] whatever it was then she my wife she was
[1:20:28] addressed in the dream right there and
[1:20:31] she loves me you see so she comes over
[1:20:35] to me was the sweetest smile you could
[1:20:39] imagine gave me a kiss on the cheek say
[1:20:42] that wasn't hard
[1:20:44] that wasn't hard it's not hard if you
[1:20:48] love somebody whatever the Lord leads
[1:20:51] you through and tells you it's
[1:20:53] hard if you're in a love relationship
[1:20:55] you know that in the scripture you reap
[1:20:58] all well you look at his life he'd been
[1:21:01] stoned he's been beaten he's been left
[1:21:04] for dead and and he was in poverty and
[1:21:08] hunger and everything and then he had
[1:21:12] this thorn in the flesh the Bible says
[1:21:15] one can be physical can be host to the
[1:21:18] false praetor and he dealt with but you
[1:21:20] know he sought God
[1:21:23] thrice it says he didn't just get an
[1:21:27] answer straightaway and he you can't use
[1:21:31] this mind until look here I'm serving
[1:21:34] God with everything not even food
[1:21:37] properly
[1:21:38] I'll get beaten up I get stoned to death
[1:21:40] like a kicked and persecuted and
[1:21:42] everything else I don't even get that
[1:21:46] you know the ants this thorn in the
[1:21:48] flesh and top of it all you know when
[1:21:53] the law came and said my grace is
[1:21:57] sufficient of you know the scripture
[1:22:00] that spoke to his heart directly from
[1:22:04] the mouth of God and that man started to
[1:22:10] rejoice in persecutions in misery in
[1:22:15] beatings he started to rejoice because
[1:22:18] of that love relationship knowing the
[1:22:22] Lord wants me to do that and you know no
[1:22:26] matter what it is if you know the
[1:22:28] presence of God so I don't know how to
[1:22:34] say it but when their presence comes no
[1:22:38] matter how have done by you are oh you
[1:22:41] know so wonderful so wonderful that's
[1:22:44] why we need to have that close
[1:22:47] relationship with him you know I just
[1:22:51] wanna finish with one or two more little
[1:22:53] examples but as years ago it just fits
[1:22:58] in I was cheated by a car dealer who
[1:23:02] sold me a dud
[1:23:04] with you know I
[1:23:06] order catalogs to story short I was
[1:23:08] meeting the manager on the Monday but at
[1:23:12] work everybody told me taken to cool do
[1:23:15] all these things you know I was a bit
[1:23:17] distressed because it didn't have money
[1:23:20] and anyway I was there with the manager
[1:23:24] the manager said look mr. rook you know
[1:23:28] they call you mister when they want
[1:23:29] money over here there is it we're in
[1:23:32] business here you've got to pay this
[1:23:34] otherwise you can't have the car and you
[1:23:37] know he went on like that I was you can
[1:23:41] say the underdog in a miserable state
[1:23:44] but then suddenly their presence of God
[1:23:47] came on me
[1:23:48] whoa okay what it didn't matter
[1:23:52] I said you know I started to for I don't
[1:23:56] know did a glow
[1:23:57] I don't know but he started to change
[1:24:00] colors but I said fine your business
[1:24:06] that's it so am I the way I do business
[1:24:10] is this here you give my car you can
[1:24:14] keep it you've had my trading and
[1:24:16] already sold can keep the money and I
[1:24:19] look from now on that's how I do
[1:24:22] business
[1:24:23] I'll tell you what he gave me the keys
[1:24:25] never don't have to pay anything just go
[1:24:27] but you see the presence of God came on
[1:24:31] the scene and you never alone whether
[1:24:35] you feel him away to Europe feeling he
[1:24:38] looks after his own he is looking after
[1:24:41] his own and then when especially in the
[1:24:45] storms of life will you have storms get
[1:24:50] you know young people have storms we
[1:24:52] think this is a joke you know they have
[1:24:56] problems and worries we think they're
[1:24:59] stupid but to some people it's real real
[1:25:02] worry isn't but you know whatever storm
[1:25:06] I was tossed to and fro on on the batch
[1:25:13] in a dream here are another dream last
[1:25:16] one I was tossed to approach you
[1:25:20] wife's now we're holding on throne over
[1:25:22] there and holding only this rile the
[1:25:24] other Rio and those who have been on the
[1:25:26] boat in a big storm you know what feels
[1:25:28] like usually have ropes along you can
[1:25:31] hold on and all that and then there was
[1:25:34] a man I was a lord and he says just lean
[1:25:38] on me I was leaning on him we were
[1:25:41] writing the wife it was actually
[1:25:43] beautiful device didn't go away but we
[1:25:46] were writing the voice and you know you
[1:25:48] write the wife you know that story
[1:25:50] brother Brent talks I'm writing and I'm
[1:25:53] writing and yonder log you know how do
[1:25:55] you get that low down there
[1:25:57] I'm writing it and I'm leaning on to
[1:26:00] Jesus we scored through together
[1:26:03] wonderful so and then you can see that
[1:26:07] wasn't hard
[1:26:08] that wasn't hurt no it's it's so
[1:26:12] beautiful when we when he can be
[1:26:15] together with a lure like this and have
[1:26:17] a love relationship where you can just
[1:26:20] commit all these things them to Lord you
[1:26:23] know what I'm going through you
[1:26:24] understand look I wanna read you one
[1:26:26] last scripture before we close Hebrews
[1:26:31] in Hebrews find then Hebrews 11 I think
[1:26:45] it is healing
[1:26:48] yeah
[1:26:52] verse 6 it says but without faith it is
[1:27:01] impossible to please him for he there
[1:27:07] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:27:10] that's the first thing so if no matter
[1:27:15] what happened you come to him because
[1:27:17] you believe he is and what else that he
[1:27:21] say
[1:27:21] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:27:25] diligently seek Him
[1:27:28] so expect the reward not have you've
[1:27:33] ideas what the reward would be you know
[1:27:37] Babu says if you receive the righteous
[1:27:41] men in their volodya receive a righteous
[1:27:44] man reward if you receive a prophet in
[1:27:46] the name of a property to receive a
[1:27:49] Prophet's reward
[1:27:50] yeah doesn't be prophets reward I
[1:27:52] received the Prophet so I'm probably not
[1:27:54] very large and double portion yeah some
[1:27:58] people get that way but you know what
[1:28:01] brother and said what is to receive a
[1:28:03] prophet what the reward is you gotta be
[1:28:06] friends with the Prophet friends and
[1:28:10] what do friends do they show you a few
[1:28:13] things what did the Lord - what this
[1:28:16] Bible says are saying in Genesis he
[1:28:19] reveals the secrets to his children
[1:28:22] that's what friends do what did Jesus do
[1:28:26] it just in closing when he shared the
[1:28:29] parable of the sower you know someone
[1:28:33] good ground and someone stony ground and
[1:28:36] all these things he explained it but
[1:28:39] nobody understood nobody understood by
[1:28:43] the mint and then I took his disciples
[1:28:48] aside and said no I'll tell you what it
[1:28:50] means he revealed it to his own and he
[1:28:54] reveals to us
[1:28:56] and is there anything your wife couldn't
[1:29:00] ask you we need to gather in your room
[1:29:03] and have fellowship and talk about the
[1:29:05] Lord and different things she said look
[1:29:07] I feel this way sometimes I feel I'm not
[1:29:10] even the Christian or sometimes I feel
[1:29:12] this you know you can share everything
[1:29:14] you can see everything with the Lord and
[1:29:17] he reveals to you why sometimes not
[1:29:21] instant but it'll come and may he help
[1:29:25] us as we even leaves that place if you
[1:29:27] have any questions bring it straight to
[1:29:30] the Lord Lord have I not been according
[1:29:35] to the world or wasn't there pleasing to
[1:29:38] you have I stepped out of my calling
