Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen thank you musicians you may be seated God bless you says no you not may see it at the the musicians I'm not going to make that mistake again God bless you um what a week Brother Andy would say tumultuous it was that but it was good because the higher the waves the closer the master amen sometimes we we need a Peter experience and sometimes we we need the mountains and sometimes we need the valleys and other times we just want to be under a tree sleeping a bit and resting but that's all good that's all in time we've got a bit of a Bible study tonight and that's not a Bible study it's more take out your word and just follow with me Liam to your Bible say sorry but um the phone can't keep up so you're gonna have to share with Reuben but just just invite him in and and just ask that the Lord would speak to you tonight maybe knock on your door you know just just come and speak to you and and help you to understand when I was putting this service together it started with um being a for real life Christian okay it means that it's with your failings and your ups and downs and your everything by just standing for Christ in your time and it kind of went into something different a little bit but more serious but for us as Believers we know where we stand so so if you feel or maybe preaching at you and you you want to start feeling like a buzzard you're not don't let Satan trick you into it just hear go back into the scriptures and search it for this is what we do so we're going to open our scripture with one Peter 2. and I just got onto that scripture and it kept coming back as the song service was coming loud and clear just keep coming back and I remember the Sunday School teachers that we love so much I think sister Braun when you did this scripture with the Sunday School or it may be a sister cheers when she was here but it was awesome it says but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light I hope you read this with me is that is that did you find it one Peter 2 verse 9. sorry didn't I give you the verse my bad verse 9. so let's read it again but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people we're an odd bunch of fellas if you really think about it you know um I'm just thinking about it we'll finish this I want to finish the scripture I'm just thinking about when you go to a a Works function and everybody gets food and they all just jump right in there and they just jump it and you stop and you say thank you Lord for this food and you pray for each one on that table that maybe the Lord would touch them will go by their way as well You're A peculiar people they cannot figure you out amen but your reason here is that ye shall so show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light you may have your seats amen um so young people let's not lose this service I never really preach at anyone but myself so this is for me but I really feel strongly to speak to our young gentlemen and young ladies that went to the the what did they call it banquet I want to keep calling it a bull but Tiana keeps telling me it's not a ball because they dance at balls so it's a banquet okay and and it's a wonderful thing because when I was young it is quite exciting to go to those you know when I was young brother beans are going to get me for that one and uh it is you're dressed up and you look nice and you and you feel nice and it's a different atmosphere in the air it's just a wonderful time in a young person's life but we live in a world which is which is really dangerous it is really dangerous spiritually and physically it's a real dangerous world it's it's it's War out there it's war between God it's war between Satan that's the only two Powers there there is no other power these two Powers these the superpower which is God and then there's just power which is Satan okay he still has power and he can deceive and he uses that that deception really nicely even starts in church you're tired you want to sleep you don't want to listen you had a big day I wonder what he's doing he's got power and they both gonna fight right here in the stop four inches so the only way you're going to get your blessing is if you're going to clear this top for inches and say Lord may your word go in there and from there may come in here so ask him to give you those words so I'm going to go to Romans 8 as well I've got this scripture here as well my title is living in the word now if you fight a lot of spiritual battles if you fight a lot of people from from the world they always use a certain type of scripture to justify why they do things they take that scripture they make it their Solace they could have heard it from a third party they could have heard it from a pastor they could have heard it from a very good sermon but they only take that scripture and they mold their reasoning and understanding around the scripture but this is dangerous because that's not Revelation that's reasoning I'm off my notes but I need to clear this up Revelation is when you find it in the scripture and the scriptures ties together the old and the new and the the word of God just comes together and it actually sinks it into your heart and the message of the hour why we follow the message of the hour is because a prophet stood here and he took the Old Testament and he took the New Testament and he said the Shadow and the the what is now the reality is coming together and it's all the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't say it is me he says it's the Lord Jesus Christ unfolding more revealing more of himself but we find ourselves in the dangerous place we find ourselves in a world which is absolutely geared up for the young people because the young people want entertainment I don't want the service do you like a service Lily every Sunday every Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday no YouTube no nothing oh I got a thinking no basketball no football Jaden nothing just church church preaching preaching who would like that Brother Andy would love that but these do you think that when we come here together that the kids don't find it boring some days they do that's all right but I want to ask you if you come here every Sunday in every Wednesday and you still find it boring are you putting in anything because this is going to be a tug of war this is a tug of war between Satan and you God already has you because you predestinated it's wreaked you win yes but every Sunday there's going to be a battle and the one that pulls the hardest is the one that's going to win and if you let the world pull the hardest you're gonna go to the world and your mind will go into the world and you'll start doodling on pictures and riding on your pins and papers and digging in your nose and doing all those other things and scratching your nails and doing your toes while you're in church because I cleaned the church the other day and I saw shavings of toes on the on the floor I was like it must be so boring in church that you would scratch your toes in church oh mama I'm I'm serious I want to drive down a point we are at a place with we don't have time for this there is no more time the prophet preached a sermon in 1965 in June June is the six months hey June July yeah on the 23rd the flashing red light of his coming and I was fortunate enough to to go and listen to the sermon so I want to ask you kids the the the young men and the young woman that likes to go to all these fancy things and dress up how many sermons do you listen to in a week how many times do you put the voice of God on in your house or in your place or in your phone because we listen to music day in Day Out music ain't gonna get you in heaven see what brother Branham hit that thing hard he says there was a spirit of rock and roll that came amongst the churches he says and those people are led by that spirit and it's going to lead them all the way into Armageddon because they listen to music they don't listen to sound Doctrine anymore they don't listen to the word of God they don't listen to the prophet of God they just listen to music have you found yourself every day listening to music yet you put the word of God to the side and then tonight you jump in bed and we all just quickly read our scripture we pray very sincerely and then we sleep have you actually meditated upon the word of the Lord have you taken food and fed yourself and how is your diet because what you put in is what's going to come out that's right that's right you know when I know somebody stuck in the world I look at them if I start seeing the eyes are glossing a bit a little more and the cheeks are getting a bit more reader you know and clothes are a bit more tighter you know boys I'm not going to hit you hard I'm just eat you soft the hairstyles change I'm honest I can see where your focus is I can see where you're looking I can see the influence upon your life so I want to I want to show you something brother Brandon preaches this and he sees these three things that would taste a man okay money popularity and thank you the responsibility when brother Brennan was preaching what fell heavily upon the woman and he got criticized a lot for it but see God wasn't like in the Old Testament looking for a king or a leader to lead his people he's looking for a bride so when the prophet of God came here he was looking for a woman a bride for Christ so hence why when brother Brennan was preaching the woman got out of control the main let it happen it's true but his Focus was not the men though he addressed them many a times he said woman you're responsible for it meaning also the church because remember this is the bride call and what happened is it was as in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah it was as the days of Noah and when the prophet stepped on the scene and he started looking around he saw the same Trend that was happening in both those ages happening right now and that's why God made him a certain way to hit it so if your sisters listen to the sermons and you think he's only picking on your hair your skirts and your way you conduct yourself it's not that it is also a really big part of it but it is about the church the church lining up with the word the full word not a little bit of it but every bit of it and sometimes when we as as as I can't say ministers come and we hit a certain thing then people get offended but that's not right because we don't get offended as Christians we we just go Lord why did you say that because if you truly believe that the vessels standing in front of you every Sunday and Wednesday doesn't matter who it is it's anointed by God and preaching the full word of God and he can show you in the scripture where he's getting it from should you not go back to the scripture instead of going back to reasoning because there's a lot of voices out there but there's only one Bible and this Bible does not contradict itself now you young man I'm going to tell you something today and I said it earlier to Tiana and then when we had a chat this week if you want the righteous woman do you gonna you're gonna the image that you have in your head you're gonna look for so if you want someone like your mom mom's I'll give you full credit you're looking for someone that's dressed modestly you're looking for someone that's in their place you're looking you're not looking at a loud mouth you're not looking at someone that flirts with every every other boy if your heart is looking for a wife and a mother then your taste will reflect it and you will look for that woman and you will dress accordingly and you'll walk accordingly and you'll act accordingly because you are going to act like a man because you want a woman so a woman when she's looking at a man and he stays is Takis and all those things and that this the slit can come up to here and the skirt is the end is nothing in between there and all those things that just reflects the taste he has I know I was in the world so I know it's a bit hard but that's the type of girl he wants so he doesn't want a mom he doesn't want a wife a help mate he just wants something that looks nice so it's as if you look at a Porsche or you look at a Ferrari or you look at a fuller it's the same thing I'm not happy with this I want that because it's pleasing to the eye but that's not how God sees people and this is what I want to tell you young people I've got such a burden for you because Snapchat and all these things and all these shorts are just grooming you to look for women like that but you should not look for them because it's not your position you're selling your Birthright you're actually lowering your standard and all you're gonna get is a mess in your house one day you're young take my advice take my advice if your taste is not a Godly taste what you're going to feed it is not going to be from God and whatever you look upon on YouTube and all those things and wherever I can see everybody can see it because it comes out because you can put only this much in before it starts coming out oh yes so so then I say some people come and say we struggle the the prophet preaches hard things and he's always hitting women and he's always why I listen to it and I see Life I see a soberness I see a reality check I listen to and I go oh God let that not be me I don't want to do that I want to just be lined up with your scriptures and time and again when he preaches he preaches at me I don't Fork it doesn't help no one he preaches to me so I wanted I want to show you a couple of things grab your Bibles open it up in in um Matthew 24. oh wait wait go go to Genesis 6 I'll Do Matthew 24. so Jesus and the disciples are at the Mount of Olives and the disciples asked him three questions okay some people think it was only one question but it was three distinct questions they asked him what would be the sign of the end of the world what would be the sign of you coming and when will be the no stone left upon this this Temple three questions but I want to answer the one tonight because I want you young people to know where you are right now because if in 1965 which was 58 years ago according to my maths and I could be wrong he already shared that the the flashing of the light the train is coming and he used this analogy he said they called it the trains and the blocks so you standing at the station and and the light is off and you're having a coffee and you're talking to to Davey and to Liam and having a lack of chat and it's all good and all of a sudden the light goes red pong Punk bang and you're like my train is on the way so what should you do coffee is not allowed on the train you don't smoke on that train you don't have other bad behaviors on that train okay you cannot take your friends on that train because you only have your ticket they need to get on the train what do you do you put everything down you get your ticket and you go wait for the train and you stand and the train comes you can't see it you can't even hear it but you know that that light flashing red says it is a coming and you need to get on it and in the old days they didn't wait for you you're either on the train or it leaves without you we're again at that time you're either going to get on the gospel train or it will leave without you there is no buts or maybes I know we preach Grace I know we preach all those things God is a good God but you still have to have your ticket which is the Holy Spirit you still need to get on the train so if the light's flashing and it's saying that there's time to repent and to get ready and to get good with God and make it right now is the time because the light has been flashing for 58 years there will be a day where the train comes in and it will be gone don't be left without your ticket whatever you do I'm not throwing you over hell or Doomsday it's a reality brother Branham said it's such a secret calling away he says in the days of Noah eight Souls were saved and all of those people only ate are you one of them brother being preached the sermon with the three monkeys man I was glad I was one of those monkeys hey I don't know who the guy was that was left behind but I was in there I know it was me and Ben at that time you know because Ben was preaching it so Sister Christine sorry I just thought I'm pushing him before you because he says this only place with two monkeys I felt like a monkey that day but I got on the boat okay don't know why they picked up the sand flies and all those other things and the creepy crawlies I wish they could have left him behind but they went in the boat so in Matthew he asked those three questions but now we're going to go to Genesis 6. so let's go to Genesis 6. young people I hope you follow me because you're gonna have to get on this boat tonight because if you don't get on this boat there might not be a world for you tomorrow no one's life is guaranteed no one so we go to Genesis and we go Genesis 6 I've got my place all the year though it's the first book of the Bible Genesis Revelation I got that okay so it's easy and it came to pass when the man began to multiply apply on the face of the Earth and her daughters were born unto them so we'll pause there for a sec because it's a little bible study so just follow me so in 19th of Genesis 6 verse 1. so in 1950 so I thought before the prophet really really opened the seals and all those things let's just go a couple years 15 years so he was born in 1933 so I thought if I hit it right in the middle 1950 would be a good good place to get these stats okay so here is 1950 births on this whole face of this Earth okay was 92 million people were born in 1950 which was recorded so by Abacus or pin or whatever they they made it happy okay so 92 million people in 2022 which is last year because we're going to use this year we're still halfway in there 133 million people were born now you say that doesn't sound much it's 44 million more a year that's being birthed on this Earth but see when I looked at the statute it didn't look like this scripture because brother Branham takes the scripture and he says that the people were multiplying he says and today they are multiplying at a rapid rate let me go tell you how many people should be on this face of the Earth abortions for the year 2022 is 73 million accounted for not the ones you don't know about so if you take 73 and you take your your 44 million you've got 104 million people more a year than 50 years ago or 70 years ago so people are increasing upon the Earth exactly as it was in the days of Noah we are increasing in exactly we cannot even feed most of the people we could but we wouldn't want to because greed plays a big role of it but our current situation now is we've got so many people and the place in the earth is just getting smaller and I want to ask you this is something that just the Lord just showed me if we have llqbtt plus hashtags and all those things communities with that's not having children what if everybody was a real mom and a real dad for real mom and dad and had children how many would we then be multiplying if they weren't all confused or wanted to be a pot plant in the center of the room like seriously man the the world is losing the marbles they're absolutely going insane but we think it's funny but it is but it's not funny because the same so so when God looked at him was gone I can't go I can't jump ahead go to the next verse please he says and he was the sons of gods or the daughters of man and they were fair and they looked up and they took upon them wives of all which they chose now that wives wasn't marrying wives if you look at the strong concordance and brother Branham hits this thing he says they just took upon them woman the word means their woman in the strong concordance go find it it actually sees that Hebrew words it's a adulterous woman okay so I've got it here on the and it hits that hard he says because what happened is the girls looked so pretty that the sons of God not angels was not angels it was sons of God looked upon this woman and they were really pretty now I'll tell you now you go walk and I went to Google 1963 fashion okay and I looked at the most prettiest girls because I just do this in 1963 they have nothing nothing on the goes out day today nothing not even a patch not not this much so you sisters you think that's your competition it's not it's a abomination in the sight of God and I feel for those people because they trapped they trapped and they following the media and they're following a fashion and they're following such pressure put on them you need to be natural the prophet says the woman needs to be natural boys you need to be natural don't fake it we don't fake it till we make it we natural we're for real life Christians we are who we are and what the scripture says we are that we are we don't deny it so go to verse 3. he says then the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that is also um for he also is flesh yet his day shall be 120 years strange Noah preached for 120 years so that generation might not get it but now I want to say to you God looks at these these sons of God that goes through this woman and starting to make this abomination and he says you know what I don't want to strive with these people now now look at this type here we've got the churches that is cutting up Christ in so many pieces and saying you can do so many different things different baptisms false doctrines all these things isn't it the same that God would look at this woman this church and go no this one but I mean I chose like like Methodist Baptist that takes the word of man over the word of God and doesn't he say the same my spirit will not strive with him so why did the message have to come because God said I'm going to remove myself from all these denominations and I'm going to get myself a word bride it had to happen because who's right if the Pentecostals is right the Baptist is wrong the Methodist is wrong the Presbyterians is wrong the whole thing is a mess so God looks as this in 1933 sins of prophet says you know what elieza you're going to go get me a bride but you're going to get me one that is dressed the way I want to dream that's going to walk the way I wanted to walk you know her hair will look a certain way her apparel will look a certain way she will like certain things she will pray different than the others they all might at the end of the day can be a lot of copies out there but that one would be genuine she will be for real life so that's the prophet's Ministry it is not a bunch of rules and regulations young men it is God lining us up to say this is the Taste and this is the taste of a real man and this is the response of a real woman so he goes on the inverse um four and it says there were giants on the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came not the Giants he says they were giants he says stop see they were giants on the earth on those days and also after that when the Suns came into the daughters of men there's no marriage said they isn't it exactly where we are today you can be partners you can be lovers you can be friends you can be whatever you want to be I don't want to marry you I don't have time for that isn't that exactly where we are today wake up man this world is exactly in that condition and the prophet said already in 50 or in 65 it's done it is done he says it is so bad that and I'm gonna play you this clip I want to play it right after this because I want to go into the life of lot as well he says it's so man it's so bad that that even him having to present the bride to Christ when he saw the vision he felt ashamed and you can hear it that's why I said are you listening to the tapes are you sober minded or are we busy with entertainment right because entertainment is going to leave you right here I'm sorry but it is it's only the ones that know God he says he says you're a worker of iniquity I never knew you you're not having a relationship with me you're not you're not you're not talking to me you're not fellowshipping with me you're not married to me because all you do is you eat everything else and when you need me you call me when things go wrong you go on your knees when things go really right you go all praise the Lord but what's the in between like it's not just for better and For Worse what's this in between where's our talk at night or when you walk you go yes Lord I love you you know I look at Brother Andy when you wrote that song blessing and honor and praise I can see you sing it in front of the throne I can see I can see that song came out of somewhere it wasn't just it must have come out and you would have just shouted it I hope it did you write the song you did because when I see him sing it I know that's a for real life Christian and I don't put you on a pedestal Brother Andy but if I have to listen to saving service in a week about I would still listen to them same as you because for me that's life it's not because I'm trying to keep myself and be like a Mormon and I can't do this I just love hearing about my Lord amen I can't get enough of it amen so we'll finish that can you uh brother Ed put that up and I want you to take a moment and just listen what the prophet says about a vision that he saw about that bride and where we are now in time the lovely bunch of women real nice dress long hair fixed nice in the back sleeves skirts down deeply and they were all in a marching tune like Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before and as they pass by us stood and there was something there uh some Spirit God and said there is the bride and I looked and my heart was happy and she went around this way and passed around behind me after a while when she come back this way he said now the modern church will come into preview and here come the Asian Church up honor received such a filthy bunch here come the other churches up all the different nations they look horrible and I I'll say this because I'm Duty bound to tell the truth before God and when he said Here Comes the Church of America now to be previewed if I ever seen a bunch of devils it was that them women were strip naked with an old gray looking thing like a color of an elephant's hide and just hold it in front of him with no upper part on it at all and they were doing this kind of stuff that these these dances that these kids do out you're that twist and stuff and that kind of music going on and when I seen Miss USA come up I almost faded now this is thus saith the Lord if you believe me to be his servant you believe me now I would say that for nothing in the world there's not enough money in all the world to get me to say that if it wasn't true and when she come by that was a filthiest looking thing I ever seen and I thought God his heart is preachers and we brother have Labor to get you a bride and that's the best we could do she was twisting holding this in front of her like all these hula skirts of a thing holding it in front of her Parts the lower part like this dancing and twisting like these kids do out here on the on these vulgar shows that they had Tristan that was Miss Christianity of America so help me by the help of God that's what it looks like in his face I I just I started I could have faded I go to all the trying and the preaching and the persuading every one of with bob hair and they were twisting and carrying on holding this in front of they come around where I was standing there with this supernatural being I couldn't see him I hear him talking to him he's right around me but when they turned this way the whole is this twisting and laughing and going on carrying on like that holding this in front of him let me standing in his presence there and his servant and of all our child that's the best I can do I hope God what good did it do me what good did he do all the crying and begging and persuading and the great signs and wonders and miracles that you showed and how I stood there and go home and cry after preaching to him and things and what good did it do man and then I have to present something like that for you for a bride and as I stood there looking she passed on by and you can imagine the back part of her with nothing on holding this in front of her as she went Shinning by like that to this twist throwing her limbs out like that and her oh it was vulgar how she was carrying on her body shaking around like that I I you say what does it mean brother I don't know I'm just telling you what I've seen and when she passed by like that I looked at her oh I just got real pain I just turned around and thought God I'm condemned there's no need to be trying anything I just might as well quit Miss Carl Williams if you're sitting here in that dream that you told me about a while ago that you had the other night that's been bothering you there it is the starting Wheels taken from the hands then I just thought I I just might as well forget it I was gone and all of it once I heard it coming again and coming up on the this side come the same bride that went around this way here come them little ladies again and each one of them was dressed in their National Guard from where they come from like Switzerland Germany and so forth each one wearing that kind of guard all long hair just exactly like there was the first and really was coming walking Onward Christian so marching as to war and when they'll pass by the previous stand where we were standing just all at once for every eye went that way and then they turned back home they went marching and just as they started to going right up into the skies this other one went up to the brick of the hill and went down like that these started marching right up into the sky and when they went to marching I noticed a couple of little girls in the back looked like they might be of some foreign girl like Sweden or Switzerland or somewhere they started to look around and got I said don't do that don't get out of Step It is a screen like that I come to a division center of my hand out like that I thought well that's the reason I said what I have tonight I want to ask you a question is it later than we think could she already be called and chosen sealed away there won't be one extra one you know could it be possible oh yes no man [Music] amen be your chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises for him who have called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light we heard so many things that the prophet has said to us and I think this is the most striking thing in the most sobering moment I had even within this week is that a prophet that preached so many servers so many services prayed for so many people would feel ashamed to choose a bride for Christ but the nice thing about this and don't lose hope and don't think different as there was a bride that was walking instead but we'll we'll go to Genesis 19 if you want to go and follow me there we want to talk about and it we're going to finish this because we definitely have the answer amen amen but sometimes it's good to just stop and sober up for it for a second just shake it all or shake the world off get back to where we leave Christ get back to to Our Roots which we are and who we are because if you know who you are and you know how God sees you then the things of the world don't matter we we go here in an angel's visit to Lord wegothi from verse 4. it says so so lot finds himself in Sodom and Gomorrah and he's at the gate and he's busy he's a he's a judge and so the two angels come to him and he falls at their feet and says my lords because he knew they were angels and he invites them into his house but see the state of the city let's read in verse 4 see it's before they laid down the men of the city even the men of Sodom compassed the house round and about old and young all the people from every quarter and they called lot and they said unto him where are the men which came unto thee this night bring them out unto us so we may know them so they didn't want to be their friends see brother Brandon picks this up as well and he says that the woman lost their value in Sodom and Gomorrah they lost their purpose for the woman of Sodom and Gomorrah now I want to ask you something it's a simple question has this world currently not lost the purpose of a woman when you get transgenders and and lesbians and all these type of things and you speak to them and people that is now General neutral and the the people asked him what is a mother that they can't answer them they can't tell them what the dictionary says a mother is or a woman is they cannot tell them the answer isn't this the very same situation we're living right in now it is later than we think so a lot reasons with these guys and he's trying to save these angels and if you go to the next verse he says and lot lot went out the door unto them and shut the door after him and he said I pray you Brethren do not so wickedly behold now I have two daughters which have not known Men Let me I pray you bring them out unto you that you um that and you do what is good in your eyes only these two men do nothing for therefore they are under my shadow of my roof so I'm asking you they've lost all reasoning this city of a lot how many people that we testify to that you talk about God Miracles things happening and they blind to it it is the same day we're living in and it's a horrible day but it's time that we get sobered up because if you get into the wave of the world you just drift along we we ain't driftwood we are trees planted By the Waters we're not Driftwood We Don't Drift with the world we're not and the day you stand at the Judgment you will be glad that you stood for this word because this word is going to stand for you that day so yes you are a peculiar people you are a real royal priesthood you are different and that's fine but see you have authority with God because as much as all these things look bleak it's just a current status of the world but that's not who you are because when God sent to choose a bride when he said that bride and he took his scepter and he reached it out for you and he says touch it he gave you half the kingdom he made you a co-heir with Christ you have privileges you have rights but see the world just wants to lull you to sleep so you forget about them you you forget about who you are you forget about who you us husband really are you actually forget that he is Almighty Sovereign God and no one can stand before him nothing can stand before him in his holy presence that is your husband that is your equal because remember you didn't lift yourself up he went to the Cross took your sin so that you could be coerced with him nothing you could do but you find yourself as the bride of Christ being called so when spirits of depression come or when anger come malice Strife lust Spirits all these things all these Devils come at you trying to to attack you do you know who you are do you know who is your husband and do you know that your husband is so close to you he dwells right within you so sometimes we pray into the ceiling and we think God can't hear us he's not above the ceiling he's not far removed from us he's a very present help in a time of need but see it's easy for us to forget our privilege it's easy for us to forget the promises and the power of it but why because we're busy being lulled asleep so that little bride at the end when she was walking and she started looking around she wasn't looking around at anything else but those people that were going down there and I'm telling you now it's God's word or the world that's the two hello that there is no other Satan's Eden God's Eden okay there is no other so if you're focusing on the world you're getting out of Step get back into State you have time right now the train is in the blocks the light is flashing so I was praying today when I went I went to see someone and I was praying and I was just talking to the Lord in the car and I said Lord should I talk about this tonight and guess where I stopped brother Ed there at the gates at the trade Gates and the light was flashing red and the gates came and I looked for the train ago at the trades are here and it's exactly what brother Branham says he says even if you don't see that train it is coming yeah so if you're disobedient and you want to go over that rail you're going to find yourself in trouble wait for the train get your ticket ready let's go home there is no time to muck about there is no time for that we don't have time for YouTube we don't have time for Twitter and all those other stuff we don't have time for that there's no time for it it's a waste of your time grab a couple of lekka apples they out of your your daily Altar and and you know and Chomp on them and pray and get some nutrients man some proteins like a piece of steak you know they take a sermon the greatest battle ever thought or is your life worthy of the Gospel you preached it that very next Sunday go get something that's got nutrition and you can chew and you can fill and you can feel filled because when you do this you're still a shallow and as Hollow as what you were before you started it cut those things I'm always going to preach again said I hate a cell phone I hate computers it is good in them but most of it that I have found is evil it's a distraction it is out of the pit of Hell why does the Apple have an apple that is bitten anyways can you not see it yeah yeah can you not see it Satan is so blase he's like oh I don't care I'll even I'll even show them a billboard with an apple that's bitten because he fell for an apple did she now that's how he is he's so arrogant but if you knew who you have and you know that he is Haman and you know who you are oh Lord you just call the King on the scene and it's over and he'll hang him by his own Gallow hey man he made for himself amen so let's go I'm going to finish with this Isaiah 59 let's go there oh man let me lose sight now I'm really now I want to preach because the thing is you know what makes me happy okay what makes me happy is if a child of God realizes who he is and who she is and all of a sudden there's a excitement there's the excitement you can see that the veil has come off that that blindness and they start sobering up and when you talk to them you're actually hearing the Lord speak back to you because he's now cleaned out vessel he's ready for service and God starts talking through a brother that was so thick and sin this day and the next day he goes man the Lord showed me this in the scripture here like okay thank you Lord It's Only God that can do it but you need to wake up amen let's go Isaiah 59 and we go to verse 19. the spirit of the Lord raises that standard who knows the scripture okay so yes the world's evil yes it's lot yes it's Sodom well what's God going to do right now let's read There He says so shall they fear my name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it and remember and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgressions in Jacob say is the Lord as for me this is my Covenant which them say with them save the Lord my spirit is now listen to this my spirit is upon thee and my words is worth Thee I have put them in thy mouth who is doing the work here shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed who's got children they want to come back to the Lord yes yes what does the Lord saying he says it will not go from this seed seed so as long as you remember that scripture it will not depart out of my life it will not the part of my it doesn't matter what the obvious States it will not depart out of my life and out of my mouth because God has put those words there and if God has done it it is a finished work don't doubt it just believe amen amen he says no out of the mouth of thy seed seed saves the Lord for hence more and forever there is no period there's no limitation we go on Isaiah 60 the Lord Glory rests on Israel it says arise and shine for the light of come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon a cell arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee now I want to tell you when you sober up and you start realizing who you are and who your husband is it you don't need to do anything but grow closer to him and go for safety and pray and read your Bible and get to know your your savior get to get to know your husband and then when all those difficult things you know I couldn't stop smoking I said to Brother Andy I love smoking ask him correct in his house but see the Lord was starting to deal with me and he started to giving me a heart of Flesh and not this Old Smoky Stony heart and then one day I just started finding out this is this is just not going to work for me and I and I say to my wife I'm going to stop smoking and I took my cigarettes and I let three cigarettes smoked them in a space for five minutes and I'm like I'm done smoking and I've said this millions of times but this time the Lord was doing the work and for the next 21 days you know it was harder to drive past because don't say it's not a battle it is a battle everything is a battle you're gonna fight but we're warriors we've got we've got so many demon no it's called Zia that's been cracked by These Hands by fighting hey and stomped under your feet my my soul's got calluses on them already because they don't they come back up because they're a spirit but you stomp them back down because your old nature brother Branham said is just behind you and it will be there till the day you change this body and that old nature always wants to come back yes and your job is to be so surrendered that you go Lord you sort out my old nature because I want the new nature because you cannot sort that guy out he is not tameable okay he's gonna be that old nature will go but your new nature the real you that's the one we're working with so I found myself not smoking but while I did that I found myself not drinking while I did that I found my music taste changed my change and Friends changed you know my conversation changed I had a prayer meeting on a Friday night in my house you tell me that 20 years ago I would have gone you've got to be joking me because when people used to say for me I pray for you I thought it was an insult I did that's what the world thinks because they're so blind but see now the Lord says here I will shine my light upon you so now there's another armanstrophy running around here somewhere looking for God so if you're in your place and you're walking with the Lord and you know what season we are in and brother Branham said on that video they saw not one more come in but they still needs one more to come in because when that one comes in we're going home so we know where we're at we know our commission you know your position so what is our duty let's get that last one amen because that's the heart of the Bride I want to meet with my Lord I don't care when I'm going to go on a date so and this is something I'll finish with this okay you come musicians you can come up because maybe some of you is um Keen not to listen to this one you come to church okay yeah you come to church so you're on a date night correct now you go oh brother Armand it's just close listen what you are looking for I almost got a brother fish there what you are looking for

trees brother Ben gave it to me my favorite socks like a blue ones that came all the way to here you know and we used to come to the the prayer meetings of pukurua bay and I came like that I did but you know what happened as time goes by I started meeting the Lord Jesus Christ and I started don't get distracted by the I started growing closer to him and then all of a sudden on Wednesday I started dressing up now if you come from work don't get me wrong if you come from work rather come here you can wear your overalls with all paint holes in them I don't care come here the Lord is here but if you're going to go on a date night dress your best because what you're going to bring God will increase that and he will return to you because he says he says that what you cast upon the water that bread you cast upon the word will return to you and you reap what you sow it's a fact so if I really want to meet with the Lord and I want to give you my all and I want to date him tonight and I want him to speak to me and change things in me and and that Old Devil that's bothering me chase him away then I want to look like a damsel and I want to look like I'm in the stress and I'm going to come
