tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning there's a thing about rising up early in the morning Abraham rose up early in the morning and settled his ass and it took two of his young men

the comfort of our seats uh how many love the Lord ah how many loves the Lord are you sure are you sure you love him amen you see the reason I'm asking you whether you are sure is that many times our

respect that little soul that has gone on to be with the Lord and remember the family and just pray for them you know the prophet taught us that you know the little ones they go straight in the arms of the Lord straight no discussions they go straight in the arms of the Lord yes we speak right now he's on the bosom you know and we will meet here one day Hallelujah we can only remember the family for comfort and for strength amen and also I want us to pray for our dear Omar Robin here with us tonight and we understand what she's going through with omatini and we're standing by them and we just want to remember her um all my tennis is going to the rest home for two weeks and Omar is not allowed to go there is it two weeks she has gone to the rest home permanently so let's just remember that the peace that passes understanding you know I love that little young sister tinny I I like her so much and she's my friend but let's pray for her she did not choose to be that way but the Lord allowed it and we never understand why God allows certain things but let's pray for him while she's there let's remember Omar here you know she's her mom and let's remember them in prayer Let Me Maybe we can just close our eyes Heavenly Father we think of the life that you decided to take home and the family Lord how they had such great expectations I believe but father it was not meant to be on this side of of Heaven you've taken her home Lord him home Lord sorry and father you know better what we can do right now is to remember the family may you comfort them Lord may you give them the peace may you be the healer may you heal their souls let them recover Lord and know that you are God and Lord Jesus Christ we bring them before you think of our ummah Robin tonight Lord and all my tiny Lord has gone into the rest home pray that everyone who can interact with her will see that Jesus Christ's presence is upon him we pray that Lord you just heal him for our eyes are limited they only see up to the flesh but your eyes are not limited Lord your eyes see beyond pass through the carnal flesh and I pray that you just protect her and they keep you while she's there father we love here we appreciate you bless our sister Robin for your work for her efforts for a undying love for her mom Lord may you just recuperate her body and your strength father we have seen and we know how she is she has been up and down with her mom and also oppa Lord may you just be with with her Lord we commit them to you tonight by faith in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen can I take off my jacket I'm I'm very much sweating even before I start but please forgive me we won't be long tonight and um so I was just asking you whether you love the Lord because we need to mean it when we say we love the Lord and I'm there isn't I'm sweating tonight you know ministers feel that they are unworthy to stand here and it's true we aren't ready Who Am I who are you who are we to stand in the in the presence of the Living God you know and the presence of God's children the bride and then talk you know but God made it that through the foolishness of preaching he can save man so I'm very nervous and and feel unworthy feel unprepared uh yet I think I have prepared but is the Lord who does the work so my challenge to you tonight not the challenge in a rude way you know we bring our attitudes to church so uh each one comes with an attitude we have an attitude this this evening the key is which attitude you have is it a God's attitude a positive attitude an expecting attitude or is the wrong one ah how is my attitude tonight so so if I'm never saying I'm so unsettled by Marion and I'm so and easy I I want to believe that you are supposed to be the same way all right ah it cannot be me the preacher only amen this is the service of the Lord I'm I'm feeling I'm standing in front of people who are ordained by God the the apple of God's eye the people who God will die for them in the presence of God and you you came prayed up to receive to hear from God not me forget about me from God and then you are standing in front of him if you remove this little vessel and you see God preaching to you ah how will your attitude be I think I'll be nervous I'll count my steps I won't be scattering and talking and say with someone and my my thoughts are outside there that is so disrespectful for God and that is why I said do you love him ah one day he said to Peter do you love me and he asked him three times and Peter cried I believe except you know you know everything Lord because he was asking him with emphasis are you sure you love me so I pray that when we say we love the Lord we want to mean it from the bottom of our hearts and be nervous not nervous of you know afraid of he's gonna kill me or what no no the sensitivity of being in the presence of God to know as brother Marcus was saying that to know this is life or death I cannot come here with the wrong attitude I can't come here with a negative one I can't come here like I'm going to you know for Bunnings oh my God no amen come on no I better not come huh I better not come I cannot come here sorry sorry to bug you and sleep or I sleep with my eyes open with my mouth open but I'm sleeping my mind is there walking there and training and thinking about another brother or the meal I ate tonight or the problems of tomorrow or yesterday really in the presence of God do I love him enough yes Lord you know when a man if you you love your wife you love your children you love your husband then you love your your your loved ones eh and you tell them every day how much you love them you think love for them every day and then you you you you express it to them but why are we not doing it for the Lord like that if we love him why why do we have reasons why we are not doing it do we love him enough but that's not our title tonight I just thought I should pass past that tonight let's just continue with that scripture of Genesis verse 15. and the angel of the Lord called This is now Abraham has walked the the road of Moriah he has gone to Mariah he has walked three days the Bible says he has walked three days right and then uh you can think about what was happening in his mind and in the mind of the servants and in the Bible says in the mind of Isaac at least the Bible tells us what Isaac was thinking says Isaac was not sure where the the animal is going to come from Isaac was Isaac was wondering what's going to happen right he walked like Jenny Abraham was not worried or or second thoughts in his mind because God told him go there Abraham knew very well that he's going to sacrifice his son for God that's what Abraham knew the sons and the brothers they knew they did not know the servants and Isaac they were wondering three days verse 16 says oh there's 50 and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I saw said the Lord for because thou has done this thing this thing of trusting in me this thing of believing in me fully Against All Odds this thing of believing in me where is really impossible how can you go and kill your son for for because you have done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I'll multiply we know the scripture let's quickly go to verse 18. and in in thy seed which is you you and me are the seed of which means we also have to walk the the road of Mount Moriah if God tells us go to Mount Moriah which means we because we are deceit right isn't it you know they say I'll tell you in my language and then I'll translate it for you maybe brother Indian brother Ben will understand me in my language they say um this is now I want to give you a direct translation you see a cow or a goat or any four-legged animal when it works where the front hoof is going to where the front right hoof where it's going to start to step to step when it works the back one is also going to step there when it works there's there's a very serious symmetry symmetrical movement wave steps the back the backward the front one the front one I mean the back one is going to step right where the front one is tipped that's you or this way right the Shepherds will know that and it is the shepherd who's going to look at the footprints of that cow and I will tell you how long has it been which cow was was that one that stepped there and look at this ah these are the seat of Abraham they are working like this they are working like Abraham now these are the seeds but what I want us to do tonight is to speak about and this title sorry I went too far okay but the real Pride of the real bride's Faith must be tested too sorry I forgot the E.T there the real but but but the real bride's faith must be tested too it can be only Abraham and it cannot be that we pick and choose what tests should we get from God and it's true we must come to a point of Faith being tested as long as we are the bride Shalom bright so we must come to the test let me show you let's move on I'll show you what I'm talking about let's go to and the next slide there some of the comments that we are going to be reading in the course I've taken them from those sermons and the prophet has taught we can you can go and read them I can share with you this slide if you want or our technicians who can give it to you if you want me to share it for you on Facebook I can't do that for you or Instagram sister now I can share on you via email I can share it for you in any method then you can go and read and and come and share together with us now faith of Abraham must be reflected in in us today the faith of Abraham remember where the friend who has walked the big one must also walk because you are the seat of Abraham and God spoke about you he said in blessing I will bless you and your seed so The Blessing of Abraham tonight are yours the Sirens of Abraham tonight they are yours The Temptations of Abraham are yours everything about Abraham is yours do you want to be like Abraham you also want to lie you already lied but we are also prophetic in our blessing ah you you if you do something wrong and the world wants to accuse you the Lord says Ah no no go to end that one that you say is wrong go ask him to pray for you you're the seat of Abraham right so Abraham came to a point where he had to go to Moriah and to be tried imagine not having children for so long I believe when I read some of the Jewish history that he was a rich man he was a rich man I don't know how truth is it is but some says that Abraham at some point he had a motel you know when you drive from here to to Auckland you pass a place called taupo and other places beautiful places they say along the way Abraham had a motel where he just built a motel for free you come you lost you wash your feet you sleep I don't know I've got no I didn't cross-reference they said but I just like that kind of over here that Abraham had a motel or a place where people would launch as The Travelers in cameras dusty and dirty they just come in large for free you can think of those white towels and they shower in the morning and they maybe stay a week and be fed and they go three that's you if this is true this is what me and you are supposed to do if it's true now our works and and our conduct on a daily basis must be able to show that we are Abraham's seat on a daily basis the pastor made their statement or was it brother and you Isaac I can't remember I said you know sometimes we we want to do things for God 1924. do you understand what I mean or 15 hours into in a day not 24 7. part-time and you know what is very strange is that with our lips we don't do that with our lips we are 24 7 7. but our it is our actions it is our fruits that shows that ah these people they're just talking about me am I still Audible so we need to be able on a daily basis to show that we are I said too much to my wife or someone I said ah someone dreamed a dream and I said ah oh yeah it was little I said ah that dream no no no no no no no no no because I was having a problem with the dream sorry my girlfriend I was having a problem with the dream I said ah you can't you can't because he was dreaming boxing people and and sorting them out I said ah that dream shooting them I said ah no no we must set your subconscious because what what because you see the Bible says at some point the Bible says somewhere that might I'm just rephrasing it the multiplication of Dreams is brought by who knows that scripture that too many dreams sometimes are brought in by too much worry nothing against dreams dream is a dreaming is a gift but we just need to be able to to make sure that our subconscious in our spirit is directed from the soul from the Holy Spirit then you get a perfect dream that is very prophetic that is a blessing you know not that I just did not I killed him and I get happy I I I know you're sleeping but I don't agree that's not my topic anyway um now you are the Bride of God right today we're gonna take it easy I'm gonna sit back and you can sit back right can I sit back and you also relax that no no of the Bride today I wanted to title this message the ex of the Bride because we've got the acts of the Prophet there's a book but the Peregrine wrote it huh we've got the Acts of the Apostles in the Bible we've got the acts if we were to go into live another hundred years what what what kind of act we're going to be written about us are we having Acts what kind of Acts what were they going to say about sister pulling what were they going to say what were they going to say about David of the leaves in in in in Willington New Zealand that was a young man then what what did wow ah what happened a boy called Liam of the strawberries with the origins from South Africa what what the son of Armand of of of guavas of strawberries that's how we are going to write write about you the act of an a young man believer called Liam what we hear about the Acts of the Apostles we hear about that the acts of brother branium how are our ex today okay I know we've got good acts we serve the Lord in everything but the majority of those eggs our lives on a daily basis is was it gonna just be a church way and just to be religious okay I just want to I'm not I'm not yet used to this thing um in the message works is Faith expressed we know that works don't save us our works will never ever save us but our works demonstrate The Faith from inside ah in fact our faith brings works it is those works that shows us what level of faith or what kind of faith or what category or what type of faith is it a saturated one is it a hot hot one or is a mild one ah or is it a very very very hard those who knows Nando's will identify with this what what faith is it you know when you eat that hot spice you don't become the same when you eat the chilies that hot one what is it that one in South Africa brother we have we have paprika that hot hot chilies oh my mom plants them it's called is it sarona oh goes chili from Brother here for brother and that one but then they make some concoction what and you eat it you feel something is coming from you take it you react there is a reaction when the word of God comes into your heart is there a reaction what kind of a reaction is it yes there's an action but what kind is it the reaction that brings you closer to God because that's where we start we say faith is worth expressed right but the issue my brother and sister is not even much there yet that is where we are supposed to be already the issue is that our faith must come to a level where it gets tested like our Father Abraham the child the leg and I will return he know that something had to happen he knew and he didn't know just how God was going to do it oh yeah also it looks like he didn't know how God was going to do but I think Abraham knew that God told him to slaughter the child he know he knew and isn't his question he knows that God promised it right how that was not an issue let's read Hebrews 11. but without faith it is impossible to please him we know the scripture do we read it we do it for he that cometh to God must believe that he is he is and that he's a rewarder God don't just ask you to believe and not reward you he rewards you because it is in through the works of that faith that you get tested right and a faith that is not tested it's not the faith of Abraham I don't believe so brother Ben Abraham's Faith must be tested if people here on Earth can do products and do things and test them if the Devil Himself tries and tests his his Legions that they are faithfully and he promotes them how much more about God he actually copied from God God tested his own faith he said let there be he never said once I mean he never said twice he said let there be light and he waited and there was light so that was Faith expressed and it was expressed in the ways let there be in my life let it Let There Be and something will come let's just believe it you see Faith but the prophet says he says faith is very simple but the devil wants to complicate it faith is just it's very simple but you can miss it right if I say to Reuben you know Reuben this verse this first love Lord verse what do we say here in New Zealand huh is cloth eh planol washcloth the other side wash clothes back home we call it vast lab isn't it Brotherman by masalapi vaslap if I say to even you believe this verse love I can throw it it can stand here on air how many believe that okay you don't believe if I say to Ruben Ruben this first love can stand can I can I throw it and it can stand do you understand me Reuben do you believe me if Reuben does not believe what I'm telling is not gonna stand but if I know that this thing is going to stand here and I'm telling him right no matter how hard right but God because he was himself alone and he knew and believed he didn't have to to second guess himself he just said let there be like I thought you wanted me to show you if the verslap cannot stand but you don't believe it so if Reuben believes that if I throw this in front of you it's just gonna land here and stop not Taking Chances bringing glory and honor for God it will stand how many believes it I can sense a bit of doubt of course it shouldn't be to to to bring you know attraction and self self attention and you know it must be to bring glory and honor it must be to boost your faith it must be you know for something as the purpose of God it will stand I believe it to stand okay let's talk about it next time but now without that Faith anyway without faith it is impossible to please him that means Faith No discussion for a bride you have it and you are accepting it or you don't accept it you have it tonight you have the faith of God because he said hey sometimes we have the faith and we don't even know that we have it sometimes we have the faith for the things that are given to us you see how cruel and a a robber the devil is he realized that there's nothing he can do to you and he just he's just he's a toothless dog he there's nothing he can do he's got no one else no more teeth he's he's so he he just he does cover your blessings like this right everything is yours given and then you fall for that you you want to to fall for it may God help us even so if it hath not works faith is dead let's not put it the other way around it's not work that saves you it's the faith that saves right let's let's hear further here about the patriarch Abraham a little bit more how tested he was God promised it he's going to be he's going how is it going to be I can't tell you but God said so I will send Jesus Christ the second time he will come in a physical form I'll ask my family when we had a prayer meeting the other day I said huh as we are sitting around the table praying what will your reaction be if somehow in the middle of the prayer you open your eyes maybe the corner of your eye and you just see a man standing also worshiping maybe not a man with white comments and everything that's an ordinary man but a holy man tending I said I said to my family what will you what will you do if right now where you're sitting you can see a being sitting next to you with your physical eyes What will What what will you do you start to cry and and be genuine and serious it is now that's that time when because those beings are there the prophet says your father is just here and you can feel him you my job and your job is to pull and talk on him because he's trying to talk come closer to you let's focus on him tagging and being closer to us then it shall come to pass that you will see a sister prayed so hard that God can show some things you know heavenly and the Lord showed it but because this flesh is such a a Hong Kong you know I said Hong Kong and from Kong is something that's not original this flesh is a Hong Kong it is such is such a fake it will just start to get nervous and just want to die because the presence of God is there but there's someone inside you who will take over this flesh and that flesh will know and just Worship the Lord yeah so what I'm trying to say brothers and sisters is that our faith is so real and the things in the spiritual realm are so real that we shouldn't underestimate them they are so genuine and so life right so life and then uh now that was Abraham and a God promised him it didn't matter to Abraham how long is going to take how God is going to do it he didn't want to operationalize God's faith he said God what you are telling me is that actually you doing it in me I don't care whether my son dies whether he rise or what happens but you knew I wanted a son so he knew all that Abraham so that was what he promised and we are looking for that hour to approach huh us we are looking for that hour to approach to take our Isaac to Moriah in principle are we ready because the time is about to happen the time is around the corner the prophets in 64 already he said it won't be long it won't be long it is 64 before I was born very few of us here were born in 64. very few were born in 64. maybe before open before maybe it's just oppa and Omar and Omar I can count I can count Without You sisters telling me your age I can count now the prophet said it won't be long at that time already it won't be long so how far are we now how far are we time-tested faith it is not every challenge or difficulty and or bad times in your life that talks about time-tested faith just because the just because there's a trial there's many people who go through trials there's many people who go through situations but does not mean that those are Faith tested Faith trials it could just be the devil is just just it's just on you or whatever whoever but if you are a daughter and a son of God everything must come via your faith everything about God everything must bring glory to God your tests your tires you must look at them with the eye of faith so that they can bring glory and honor to God about our lives huh do you believe me every situation in a Believer it's life must reflect if it's a child if it's happiness if it's whatever including you see that means that whatever we do we must be careful however we live we must be careful whatever however we think we must be careful I said to you I'm so nervous do you think I'm nervous of you I'm not nervous of any of you you are my brothers and my sisters I'm not scared of you I can tell you outside and say I know Brother David I'm not scared of you and truly I'm not scared of you you are not scared of me right so it's not about a human being it's about being in the presence of the Lord so now whatever we do because we are in the presence of God we are uh what's the word we are question ties we are made our way we are alert we are sensitive to the spirit of God not about the church this church are we together so it's not every trial for anyone whenever it happens the devil can cause Havoc he can cause whatever he does but when he comes to you he says everything must bring glory to God everything must bring somehow the fact that I don't know how it relates to my situation that's not me because you are a bride you are a bride and you are a bride of God you are a wife of God you know the meaning that they say the best thing that a man can have brother Ben Bailey the best thing that a man can have I was reading a message choosing the bride and while I'm reading it by the end he said that sleep of brother of American brother what's his name yeah preaching talking about choosing and I was reading I was busy reading I wanted to come and talk about choosing a bride and I said ah no no no no no let me leave that for brother our it I was so much intrigued and I was going to have to talk about brother Ben and all the young people here you see but I didn't want to put them on the spot but it was it would have been more about Christ and the bright you and the bright I mean you and the Lord sorry hit the bride and the Lord so so so so so everything I forgot my point that I wanted to say it but it must bring Glory it must bring honor it must bring praise to God if not it's yours put it aside if it cannot bring something about the Lord if it can bring Praises about you one side forget about it it's just going to be a distraction for you it's just going to be a head for you it's just going to be a derailleur for you it's just going to be something that brings you closer to the devil than God if it's about me this makes the Fulfillment and manifestation if it's about me if it's not about God if everything that I want to do or most things are not about God huh then that just delays my growth you know this makes the Fulfillment and manifestation a true Faith difficult it makes Faith difficult to prosper and to win that man that that man the prophet says she said hair and muscles and it's such a big thing faith it makes it very difficult I make it difficult for him if I do not focus on the Lord with my my actions daily and I allow the devil a week week no myself nothing I make him to appear like he's stronger than that man that called faith that the prophet talks about the Loose Ends we spoke about this Loose Ends last time you know and the prophet says notice there she is who the bride right now she's lost you are losed from everything of the world you are loose from Evil thoughts from whatever that is why he the Bible says um not what does he say he says I want to paraphrase I forgot the scripture move away from all evil and all the things of the world and the appearance of the world of the things of the world he who loves me and who he who love the world the Bible says the love of God is not in that person if you love the world and the things of the world if you love the world and the appearance of the world what is the appearance of the world today I mean we've spoken a lot about the appearances of the world we have spoken a lot about things of the world but if you love them then the love of God sorry if you love the things of the we just have to be honest with each other if I love the world me brother and Paul if I've got some elements of life in the world then the love of God is not in me and I mustn't shy away and make it as if he's in me I must go bow down to God and say Lord remove the things of the the incest this Zeal of one or when I want to talk to do things of God I become not so active I become uh what's the word um and occupied I become not interested but when you want to do the things oh the things over there you jump you're the first one the things of the world activates you anything why why is it like that this is the Magi why when I think about the things of the world as and as ah I'm coming or I mean the young one but the point here is I must be very zealous and a very passionate very zealous when it comes to the things of the world that is an indication that there's something in there that is an expression of your faith in God think about it my brother my sister just be alone just be alone each one just switch off just think about you are in an airplane in your own booth alone think about it why why when I think about doing God's things spiritual things don't tell me about school and then business and then work no no no let's wait we'll come to those God knows about those ones what God is interested is a spiritual things that are giving you eternal life things that you are imparting eternal life to others I currently playing every day saying no no no no pray for me that I can get a promotion every day I'm asking you yes of course I must ask I must pray for the Lord to prosper my business when I pray for Isaac's movies to move on in the Lord to prosper and bless him but the real focus of what we want the the front one must not be these physical things the priority every day must be Lord me bring me closer Lord I'm prepared to put everything aside are you prepared I must be prepared that must be the priority right now I want to talk about loose ends you know Loose Ends uh you know when you have sold the dress oh my mother is she makes things with her sewing machine when she finish in the days in the olden days and I spoke about this before in the olden days where there was no overlooking machine or let me say when my mother did not have it laughs she was so dressed and everything and there will be friends everywhere on the floor even after I finish cleaning the house and there was no vacuum clean I must take a broom and and not this broomstick that you are using no no no no that's that's ah that one I don't know what to call it Omarion that broom a real broom you know with that you did you see it when you went there the one who is made of touch and and it's tied up in your and you bend yeah and I will sweep even outside our yard outside the whole place where you put lawn and Paving and you are working on it we'll we'll see from there to the underside too so now now now what I want to tell you was about my mother when she finished sowing and the the dress is ready now dust it like this and everything and take it out inside outside and then you'll see there are some threads that are hanging everywhere even if she can do this they won't go away she must take a scissor and it must be a sharp Caesar and it cut them and as much she she's very careful she's very careful because she spend hours designing the dress sewing cutting and sewing it with a pattern she spends sleepless nights the Lord spent a lot on you now the Lord this is moving Loose Ends he cast them sometimes we were the first the Lord can allow us to shake us have you ever done a a clothing like this on the line before you hang them if you're standing next to the person doing that and that water splash on you is so painful or you just go to the drawing nowadays ah come on you get a sister I think we must have a workshop for the for the young mothers The Young Ones sister Robin and train them prepare them to be mothers no no not not Pakistan the Bible says you all are elderly women must prepare and a train our young women how to be good Mothers and a good wives we must prepare them and that means fathers must prepare Sons and you cannot prepare someone if you are not prepared we must prepare Sons and Daughters to become good Godly wives notice them about how to look for a boy train them in the way of the Lord in the scriptural way I'm out of my topic now but that's what we need to do mothers I I I can't wait for the day where elderly sisters will have a meeting just to talk about the young people saying them talk about God talk about situations how do you come on disease because some things we may not say them on the pulpit yes some things we might not say them here but Hannah needs to know them Anna needs to know that ah when happy comes from work I give me a cup of tea she needs to understand that [Applause] sorry because Hannah did this to me so I'm sorry I'm not trying to it's because she she said I said I was responding to him the fact of the matter is that we must produce products for God the world is looking at us they are benefiting from our lives our children must come out of that oven hot have you ever have you ever felt a paper coming out of a photocopier machine or bread coming out of an oven is hot and is is thick it's not just flat it's throwing ice from the oven fully baked fluffy soft ready to be eaten right this loose ends are not wanted we don't want Loose Ends that means a we are not looking for Loose Ends there in the world we are looking for loose ends here on this dress that is about to be worn that is about to be put on we are looking for Loose Ends where if we are in denial and say there's no Loose Ends we deceive ourselves if we so James says if I say I'm not a sinner I'm lying to myself well expose the Loose Ends Lord in my life I want to see them Lord so that you can cut them I always say even when you pray and you don't know what to pray for ask God to give you something to pray for ask for the need of the need of the need don't let the devil seek you and say you can't ask for that he said if you ask anything in my name I will give it to you anything what does anything mean it means if I've got a problem that is blocking this Pro this problem to be solved and then this one is blocking I must pay for the whole chain to be crushed have you ever played that game of block blocker is it blockers well just break things the Lord must break everything but I'm just break everything remove it the thing of the thing of the thing of the same that is causing a problem the Lord must show it to you amen that's what the Lord must do in my life in your life now this church amen let me not talk about idiot so you see those are some of the things that come in our lives um sorry let me go here these are some of the some of the Loose Ends things that come in our lives eventually if we are not able to expose them and cut them because we are born with them this flesh not us this flesh is born with those things and the devil capitalizes on that weakness of being born in sin and all those things come ah so we need a spiritual eye of understanding for us to be able you know not to have all these things and and be able to say this side no complexes you know what is a complex the pastor spoke about the complexes but I just thought I can expand a little bit with a personal example do you allow me yes ichino you see a complex is a very gender dangerous thing it's a strong loose end it needs a big Caesar and sometimes you have a complex and you're not even aware that you have a complex a complex is something like you see where I grew up I grew up in a country of segregation in my country we call it apartheid upper side means to separate to live apart I grew up in a country like that where blacks there actually I was telling my kids there's nothing like blacks or or white we are just ethnic ethnic groups I'm not politicizing eh there's no white in my view and and look I'm not changing your views I'm just trying to make a point I grew up in a country like that my dad at some point he was I wish this could be switched off I'm you know my dad at some point he just stopped in them driving and he found an accident and a family of the white people or Africans or white people was involved in a car accident and the police just stopped them they just stopped every taxi every every every every car that I had black people they just stopped them and they start to beat them just beat them for what no that's the I'm trying to show you a complex eh you must listen carefully so you you grow up like that you grow up looking at the white brother and like anything like this you just just by looking at him you hate him you grow up like that you grow up knowing this is my enemy it only takes God now you grow up the devil capitalize on that because he created all these things and you grow up like that until God takes over and change that and it can be a stronghold day even Believers you can find a pastor saying I love the Lord praise the Lord but still hating your head brother or still hating an African brother and that's the spirit our sharing with Andy last time that the spirits that the devil plants in all the the countries of the world eh he he categorizes them in this country this spirit this country so in my country it was that spirit and you are blessed to to have the Revelation to find that oh this is the Devil he's not part of me God bring a big sister for this one Lord and God cuts it you see now a complex comes like this and then you you you sit there and then you you say the Lord anoint you with the spirit and then you say the Nature has changed and but you are brother and poor but now if every any white person who can do something like brother Alma like this the moment he does something wrong or something that I perceive to be wrong then that that that thing comes closer that's what happens it comes closer why because it hasn't died so if you have not defeated that complex if God the Lord has not cut it be careful are you a bride are you a believer so we might be very careful same here in New Zealand same back in 1972 the way Isaac showed me a newspaper when he lived in India he showed me a newspaper where in New Zealand people who were protesting that they don't know in the Box the Box will come here and and then the people who were against that kind of a thing that no they must come they support what is happening there because there was also segregation in one way or the other so when you look at a person like that and you allow a spirit like that kind of a complex you don't even want to talk about it we must cross these things because they are not for us they are not for us and then and then when I look at Armand I'm even proud proud to say who are you more than my brother and we can sleep on the same bed he looked there I look there or we look together he's not on me because and from the bottom of your heart right it's not something that you make up the time of pleasing one another is over the time of time to be nice to one another are over brother why are you treating this boy different from this one like the things they do in their schools so you shall say Lord you know when when you do something stupid when I grew up we just said we said the Lord must have said ah shame forgive them Master Lord forgive them even Stephen said forgive them so we are so high in our faith that our works show that we are Beyond segregation Spirits we are Beyond family Spirits we live beyond no matter what happens Brother Andy no matter so those kind of spirits we must know that they are dead in our lives they are dead and we don't means our weights now if you allow them in your life let me tell you what you're doing you're bringing everybody here you're pulling everybody back it's like someone who's sick at the corner the deacons anointing with oil and or a family that needs comfort and they use your attitude still like that me it has here that's why it must start with me with me the way I think the way I look at you the way I reacted the way I behave alone before I come to you to greet you alone with God ah it's nice to be a believer because we can tell each other everything so that that will pull everyone back you're making this church suffocate my attitude can cause a problem to a healing of someone not even a physical healing much spiritually hidden just because of my attitude because I allow that old nature always said you know we leave our country and we come here and we change it you know it's very very true and I agree with my brother but you know you know what happens to Spirits excuse me Spirits can spirits don't die and I don't know how they cross the Seas we fly you know they can follow you overseas everywhere they can follow you if you go now to my country you'll find these guys who drive taxis do you saw the man they have pulled in front of you they're all people sorry sorry not even sorry there's nothing wrong so someone said to me if you go to Nigeria if you got most of the countries developing candy if you go to New York Las Vegas and one day takes Same Spirit I'm telling you because the devil categorizes people he says are these these races or there's countries there's countries you know until Americans when they come when an American comes here if he is not repented you can see this an American is perfect ah yeah you can see that ah this is suffering from the spirit of being pompous you're like huh you know Americans the nose is up there's the spirit on the country so the devil puts those Spirits in different countries and then he put them in different people oh there's women and there's men until my daughter tells me Papa who told you I can't play that game because I'm a girl I said no forgive me I just I just apologize the Bible says there's no more Greek there's no more what there's none of those things the context of the scripture was that don't group people of God say no no you know you're a girl you can't do that girls and boys huh they must play together they must they must we must mixed it was in front of God we are just his children we are a bouquet flowers I just wanted to heed that thing that you know you know Abraham Lincoln said you know even if he takes my life I want to eat that thing it and that man didn't even know the prophet maybe but he wanted to hear the spirit that it must not even cross the minds of people that you look at your brother and you think ah white men wait what he said brother it's not Asian it's not what it's a brother it's not kiwi it's not South African I'm just me and David I look him as my son he looked at me as his death secondary day I said to Malachi Malachi I've got a deal for you my friend he was visiting my house I said ah man I feel like I feel like you know I feel like I want to be your uncle he said ah I said yes I said but the deal is that a you can come here every month yeah every month you can I'll make up a 10 for you and the boys and then in exchange of you calling me Uncle from now on you listen to me doesn't call me brother and I feel good hey Malachi so the way we look at one another it must that must be broken otherwise your faith is going to be weakened your faith when it comes time to challenges you won't pass those challenges because there's upstairs Loose Ends this dress must be worn this trouser this suit is ready to be worn sister Tessa this two-piece is ready but there's some loose ends sister the sister of the Lord must cut those things so that my faith can stand the test of times out there when I walk have you ever walked with one that the the pants is like this something is that the disease is or the jacket you know where we teach this like this and then you talk confidently people say ouch it's embarrassing so the Lord wants to seem all those things so that we can be a perfect well adore well done bright perfect one Sister Christine isn't it that's what the Lord wants to do brother Ben and he's doing that for us and we allow him to cut those things not not blog him not say no no no no no no we allow him to remove them the Loose Ends notice there she is loose you are free it's not even an issue anymore for you just give it to the Lord to remove that thing today if you still root and he'll remove it to the root you know when they remove a what a what do you know a what a what when they remove it they go to the root they chase it in order to Chase is to burn it [Laughter] was in Zulu to banish to chaser so let her change it then says which is it so it must be chest chiseled I don't know a better way so everything that is not of the Lord in our lives and we mustn't shy away to say Lord chisel me until the image of Christ comes and chisel me Lord if there's a loose and show it to me that I can pray against you Lord I take you so seriously I love you so seriously Lord why can't I tell you every morning that I love you why can't I speak to you daily my father why why why do I want to be serious when it comes to church woman how many read that message is that sister Robin sent every day Faithfully every day reading them not with an obligation that oh she said I must read again not that's the wrong attitude with excitement that oh sister you didn't send today you didn't send she said oh sorry I forgot you said because you can't wait there that's that's what I'm talking about I'm going to finish it's homegoing time now for the bright we are about to go but thank God the little bride has made herself ready I can see here I can see the dress ready it ain't going to be it ain't long just hold on the prophet says it it won't be long I don't know how long I don't know when nobody knows that but we know it's close now real this was 1960 what four what's that this year he's talking about these movements at least what's the right word Atlanta movements and all those organizations watch it watch that watch nature natural what what's happening this Earth is like a big trombone he does he's out of his own cater the Earth itself is sending that sound you know they say climate change they say all they don't know nature is groaning everything is showing some animals I went home I went to the felt some animals that I grew up knowing that is extinct now some animals you'll find them well they never used to be you find them some are gone because the Earth is groaning everything nature the egg is wobbling it's making it a big out of his orbit you know it's going like this it's drunk with sin of this world is drunk it's just one to best and yet every day we see everything you open the news they want you want to hear the news opening they say hey we greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you don't see the news like that everything you see negative negative because the mentality must be of Preparing People to go to hell for tribulation that's what the devil is doing to prepare this world what are you doing to prepare yourself what news are you updating yourself every morning which ones the ones that you are reading are the ones that are preparing and they are showing you which direction are you going amen homegoing time now watch no matter how many churches rise up what else they are blind to Christ and held to that law and God gave them ropes every one of them because they went down in I can't see better there in my title so the lord gave them ropes so he's talking about those ones that died amen this thing I'm gonna try to make it I'm not seeing well there but that's fine don't worry now now Faith is so simple that's what I was trying to tell you earlier on it's so simple and the way it's so simple it's like God himself God can God manifest himself in so simple ways that sometimes we we miss it so simple they missed it they missed to see that he was God he was the son of God they missed God manifesting himself in Simplicity you know that's that's someone that the prophet preached in the seven churches God manifesting himself in simply Simplicity to a point where you can miss him me and you can miss God because we are looking for they say it's the figment of our own imagination sometimes misleads us our old nature so now it's so simple the scripture says faith is a substance of things have hoped for and is an Evidence of Things Not Seen and evidence you know when we say evidence we don't even mean circumstance circumstantial evidence no no we mean hardcore evidence that's how faith is it is so real real that that you can touch it but yet you can see it now you came to change this this night and you just jumped into your car to come to change why didn't you think first whether the car will start in a plane oh hey honey wait wait just don't talk don't talk let me try it what did you do that did you say hey you know what ah I don't know if this car will reach Church because you believed that's how Faith Works you believed okay maybe this example might be too simplistic because you'll say I've put petrol and I trust my car no no no you don't trust your car it is faith Faith works like that you must see me when I wake up rushing for the train at Trantham station in the morning I jump in that car before I even close the doors already revising because I believe the car is gonna move that's very how it works it's not Faith doesn't question no faith doesn't question whether uh you you gave me this Bible and I say ah David I don't know if I should tell him I was thinking that you know that doesn't negotiate he says Thank You Lord you gave me this Bible thank you think I take it even if you you it's not there yet with my visible eyes you up as my dad told me I bought your Bible it's as good as I have it to me I have a Bible because my dad told me I have it so for me I'm already paging the pages of the Bible that's how Faith Works to trust you know you know that little Daniel when his father talked to him and say he told me I don't know if I can tell it brother me he told me and I could see faith in that boy's eyes he told me without missing his ways foreign then we talk like friends he tells me things because friends talk things so I I I took it quickly to Spirit I see faith in that boy because his father told you and I'm telling you nothing is gonna stop himself with Elijah in South Island him he sees himself he's already there you can't come and tell him he's not happening no that does not work that's how it is you say Lord you said it father I never said it you said I have it here here's your weight Lord God wants us to remind him and say Lord was it not you who opened the Red Sea Lord was it not you was it not you that day when the Lord his word pricked you and you repented and you cried you I remind him Lord it was you that day you spoke to me was it not you Lord who who you know who who brought me brother Ben the first time I saw brother's house I just look at this brother anyway eating on the table there because I like to check people just to understand them I look at him and I say God bless you brother God bless you because I'm talkative you know I must admit then he says hello hello bless you then I try to engage him and I think this guy does not want to talk too much then I just see him talking tell him about the band that I know oh my God what happened to the car yeah the car the story of the car and I said ah maybe it's a brother who's going somewhere then I didn't realize that this is my friend and the Revelation came much later so God looks at you and you are underrating yourself and he says but so God is just going to allow the devil it's a tool not a the devil is not a vessel of God he's a tool he's just gonna allow that tool to get to you just to wind you up a little bit for you to know who you are because you it's like have you ever seen a situation where you know this child knows this thing and you come on yeah that's what God is doing and we sometimes just can't seem to see here we are and what we have and what we are losing ah Maybe we it's time it's time we wake up my friend don't you think I may be a mile from the bridge but I have been given a full earnest deposit I you can't tell me I don't have bread I have been given I might be a mile away I might be two kilometers it might be tomorrow but I have a break there I may be a mile from the bread but I can I can be just as happy with that quarter of in my hand as I as I can when I got the bread as if I've got it in my hand because I've got the pictures of power of the bread that's the faith we've been given it's the faith that is given us the earnest of our expectation it has given if God is the substance it's the evidence is that the deposit has been paid oh it's past nine the deposit has been paid when the deposit has been paid everything is ready for me it's just to move on to move into the house or just to collect the car my father has got the key waiting for me they're at the dealership is paid up already in full so I'm still saying yeah let me let me let me call Dad and find out if he's real father that that is it are you sure is it real dead hey yeah yeah why are you nervous about what the father has promised you didn't he say let there be light was it not him was it not him who said let there be the f was it not you who called you in the mouth of sin was it not him when you were drinking not thinking about him or was it you who went to look for him he found you now it's not the time for me and for you to doubt him on small things but he had come to church and then come here no we come here with great expectation we come here with great humility no humility knowing that we are coming before God meaning business no time for me to come here and start thinking about the season everybody who's here who's no no no no oh no it's not oh that one I don't know please man let's not rate ourselves too low right we are you are the bride the bride knows she's the bride you can you can ask if the bride that is in here when you look at them you see this one is a bright when I look at there now I see a bride isn't it she's engaged he said who does married you you that's you you already have a ring and it's not the the goal is not from this world that your ring is particular is is when it shines the Devil Falls very far just flick your ring like this the Devil Falls Way you see like sister Maggie when he just she just do a hand like this she's just you see and the devil goes far no boy will say hello not even hello hey Ben already told me hello okay she will say okay that's how that's that's why this topic fascinates me the the one of young people getting married because he talks about the bride and the bridegroom no devil must tell you you look nice today my husband has already told me thank you don't tell me that I'm I'm good how can the devil tell me that I'm good no my husband will tell me he already told me I'm good for him you you can't make a comment about me Satan period right is doing just I don't mind it don't mind Bennett because you're my friend so that's that's the bride and the bridegroom that's how we are and we spend a lot of time in our everything thinking about him I can tell you if there's a machine now to measure Maggie's mind on a daily basis you will see what's going on in there in that mind how much time do you spend thinking about him the little time at work you know when you think of him your heart goes like this oh Lord you saved me you know you know they will tell you what the game was when I think of you my heart goes like no because you are in love you see and even us who are Alzheimer's we must pray for the for the we must pray for that refresh you know when you take a computer that when I think of my wife now my husband you know and when she looks at me that's that's about bright and the blood group every day because he has done so much more than your mind can fathom or can imagine I'm just gonna wrap it here brothers and sisters what I wanted to also read for you was these scriptures um Malachi chapter 4. because we've been called to be for our hearts to go like back to our forefathers in faith huh you know the scripture let's read it and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts that verse the heart of the children to the fathers is you and me now lest I come and smite the Earth with the case but I want us to read that middle middle sentence the heart of the children to their fathers our our forefathers in the gospel in the Lord the apostles now we are we are we are being called back our hearts our hearts Our lives our doings our everything back to them it must be a through a reflection of what happened in their lives what is going to happen today with this bride with those children must be like that previous verse that top verse their hearts of the fathers to the children we receive and our hearts back to them if they suffered if they exercise faith if they were just walking in the shadow their Shadow just touched a sick man and they they get healed that's what must happen to you and to me today our hearts must go back to the heart of our forefathers Our lives our everything lest God is going to come and smite everything so we are we've got it we it's in US is on us that all these things that I'm talking about must pass and our hearts must now be a true replica actually even more because the Lord said there verily verily I say unto you that believeth he that believeth on me the work that I do shall you do also even Greater Works than this shall you do that's what he because you are the gem you know what a gem if you read Hebrews chapter the last book of Hebrews or Hebrews chapter 11 he says those guys wanted to live with like like they wanted to live in our time because we are at the very end of the end they are going to ask you say Robert how did you make it right and and only then you know we'll have a true picture and understand it by and by now we are still limited and but let's wake up and not be limited let's understand who we are if the angels are going to to be amazed at the kind of songs you'll be singing thank God for the Isaac has already started the angels are going to look and say because they never fought like you they're going to say wow wow Angels get billing them they're going to be amazed make them make it what is that thing that we make when when the people the bride passes and we stand this and aisle angels are going to say wow and they look at you you say they wish they can talk to you and ask you how did you overcome I just want to spend 50 years with you please just explain to me I don't want to say 50 years but because in heaven there's no this time that we are talking about it's Eternal time in heaven there's no like this time as we know if there's no you see it's everything is just eternity so 50 years or 20 years or 100 million years won't be an issue there's no rush have you ever sat and thought about just in closing how is going to be in heaven and what you're going to do don't you want to be there don't you think it's worth two spend every minute about God's business I'm not saying we must not live our lives but every opportunity we get amen you must use it and may God help us on that note that our hearts can go back to the hearts of our fathers the devil must know that when a Son of God passes here this is the son of God this is the daughter of God I'm not gonna I'm not gonna try the devil must know that he can use my lips my mind for him he must know that not for nothing not for nothing so I think I will leave it here trusting that you have been blessed trusting that you have been encouraged if you if you are wearing your spiritual jackets as per the Marcus says I'm sure you have picked up some few golden nuggets they are ones I'm sure you have taken a bit of ten five percent fifteen percent the adults I'm sure you've taken you know at least 80 percent eh but the key is that our faith must come to a point where it gets tested because we are in a journey we are crossing over if the prophet in 64 said it won't be long it won't be long for real it's probably way later than we think and we've got no time for shenanigans of the devil and thoughts and things no no no no the moment you get that thought crash it like the devil must know he'll get a beating when he comes closer to you about silly stuff of him they belong to him I want to be so free that even Freedom will feel unworthy you know Freedom will feel that it's not worthy to be around me so free of all the devil's Shenanigans so may God bless you may God really enrich you it's my prayer as a church as individuals our visitors may the Lord shine upon you as you travel alone thank you for sharing with us tonight may the Lord bless you may the Lord really really test you it's my prayer I'm not Hashem because the Bible says we must count it all joy basically we should be saying Lord if you're going to use the devil bring him on that must be our tissue bring him on and Lord I'm in your hands you already overcome for me but try me try me and if you challenge yourself like that then you're going to be ready you're not going to say Try Me Lord and then you go and forget to pray and say ah no I was so tired you were what tired this flesh must be subject that this flesh must be subject if we say there are Services there's going to be Outreach or or someone is going to preach there we must support that because we are looking for the last we must not give excuses we must support and pray over it and go there huh if they say a mission of God who must support and go pray and go there physically to support it one hour I'm finished please let's stand on our feet I if I've just been all over the show forgive me but I pray that the little bit that I spoke through the help of the Lord is a blessing unto you and it just encouraged you and it has said the musicians can come and it just really motivated you and really challenged you to come closer to the Lord these things are of the devil that he's trying to bring in our lives they are not ours they are his he knows we are a golden people we are a bride and he must know that the certain things that he can test you anymore Hallelujah the song in your heart I give myself I am that's the song As we sing that song we are just going to be Reverend again and we're going to pray and then maybe maybe in your heart you've got a desire you know there was a young woman who the prophet was baptizing people and and said let's close our eyes and be Reverend and she she clothed her eyes she later became his wife she closed her eyes and she she had [Music] that voice so if we are Reverend before God and say let's close our eyes and be reverent and pray we we just want to observe the presence of God that nothing should disturb us not in front of my eyes because the eyes bring thoughts and lift up our hearts and our hands before him and not look sideways then then God have time to move as the angel passes touches you maybe maybe you want to pray for someone who's really needy as as we are we are Reverend before
