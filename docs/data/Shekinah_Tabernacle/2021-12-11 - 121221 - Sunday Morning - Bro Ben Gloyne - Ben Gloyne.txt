[Applause] [Music] i oh [Music] i'm amazed how you came through your precious [Music] they're all washed away all my sins [Music] musicians hey good morning everyone i want to apologize for last sunday i had jacob no i had isaac climbing jacob's ladder i don't know how i got there but you know someone asked me after service don't you know the story you know i'm sorry about that i'm glad someone was listening though um anyway yeah so um anywho let's go to deuteronomy 29 once i'm sorry i don't know how you can get isaac climbing up jacob's ladder when it's jacob's ladder um anywho deuteronomy 29 and 1. um we're going to read just the first six verses of deuteronomy 29 here and then i mean so it says here these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside the covenant which he made with him in horeb and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt under pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles yet the lord hath not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day and i have led you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxed and old upon you and my shoe is not waxing hold upon my foot you have not eaten bread neither have you drunk wine or strong drink that you may know that i am the lord your god amen this is bowheads in the word of prayer this morning gracious heavenly father we want to thank you that we can stand here and rejoice and lord the god of our salvation lord knowing that because lord of your precious blood all of our sins are washed away thank you lord for the blood of redemption lord that you've redeemed us back to yourself and i want to thank you we can gather here one more time i just pray father you just take over the service lord may you lord anoint speaker and hearer may you just have preeminence lord may have first place in every life dear god i just pray you would anoint your word to our hearts we need you the great author to come and make your word live in our lives and that's what we need and that's what we desire lord you'd come and live in us like never before grant it dear god we want to commit the service into your hands and lord we also want to remember those who are sick and body who are not here father this morning i pray you touch them lord be their portion and strength lord if they're watching by the way the stream lord may you be so real and present lord wherever they are grant it father we love you to commit our lives and this service into your hands may you receive all honor glory and praise in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you may have your seats this morning um so that's quite a so i want to look at this scripture here uh it's you think it's quite an incredible statement where moses has has you know if you see where they're standing there um they had been 40 years in the wilderness they had been in egypt they saw the plagues they saw the red sea open they saw incredible things happen but yet moses is telling the children of israel you saw them but you didn't see them you you know you saw what god did but you didn't actually have eyes to see until this day so they didn't have an understanding of really what was going on until that present moment to me that's incredible where someone can be in the miracle they can be in the deliverance oh you know the younger generation they walked through the red sea they saw the plagues they heard the cry of the egyptians when the you know the death angel came in the past overnight but they were safe under the blood they they saw you know god come down on mount sinai and incredible things happen but yet the lord told told them you haven't understood until now and this is being played out uh in this day now i just want to read a bit from hebrews 3 because we need to understand uh that the that the journey that israel took from egypt into the promised land uh is a shadow of the christian journey so the old testament is not just something that's tacked on the bible is history or something it's actually it's jesus christ revealed in the whole scripture and so when when we look in deuteronomy here in 29 this is not some abstract thing but it's actually god uh showed this in a shadow actually patenting our day so here we are we're going to read uh quite a bit here hebrews 3 from seven down to um four and and eleven i trust you don't mind this reading but i just wanna lay this foundation to to show um you know the apostle paul will be inspired by god to pick up this journey and and he would he would land as a as as a type of the of the christian journey he says wherefore uh as the holy ghost saith today if you'll hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the days of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me prove me and saw my works forty years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do all they earn their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my wrist now you think about that verse 10 they have not known my ways but they were in his ways they saw his ways they saw his mighty hand they saw him doing credible things but they did not know his ways um so now now verse 12 take heed brethren least there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today least any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end while it is said today if you'll hear his voice heart or not your heart is in the provocation for some when i heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see they could not enter in because of unbelief let us therefore fear at least a promise being made of us entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed to enter into rest as he said as i've sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest though the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached into not in because of unbelief again he limiteth a certain day saying in david today after so long a time as it has said today if you will hear his voice heart and not your hearts for if jesus had given them rest then he would not have have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that entereth into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief so the apostle paul is taking the journey of israel from egypt into the promised land and paralleling it with the christian journey now this rest that we talk about here is entering into the baptism of the holy ghost it is not keeping a day as it was in the old testament that was a shadow as the apostle paul would say in colossians let no man have respect for you of your new moons or sabbaths or feasts they are but a shadow but the fullness of christ right so so the rest even jesus would stand he'd say all you that labor come unto me and i'll give you rest i'll give you a true rest so not just keeping a human you're not just keeping a day but an eternal rest and we know that that rest is when you really receive the holy ghost you have you have entered into god's rest where it's no longer you trying to be the be the christian you're trying to do the works but it's him and you being the christian because that's why he says there where on the seventh day uh god rested he entered he sees from his own works so so this is verse 10 here um chapter four and and they that he that entereth into his rest he hath also ceased from his own works as god did from his because when you really meet god it's no longer you living the apostle paul said it's no longer i that liveth but christ that liveth in me so the apostle paul from experience is saying i have entered into that rest and and that is that is the absolute must of a christian jesus did not just um he did not just him he said you must be born again you must enter into this rest amen but you see now the so so what has happened in these last 50 odd years has as as israel went from egypt into the promised land so as the bride of christ made the same journey now there's been a lot of people who have who have started the journey um but it's those that finish the journey that really matter now you know they started out they were called out of egypt at an exodus and they came out in that exodus but there came a season where all of them actually could enter in the land because of faith you know the apostle paul would say here they could not enter him because of unbelief so they had to believe that generation that you know caleb and joshua's generation they had to believe that they could go enter into the land but they did not they they gave an evil report those other spies and they said we cannot go in but caleb and joshua they had a real faith the land is ours let's go get it we're not meant to be stuck in this wilderness here even even god would say in deuteronomy if i can find the scripture he says that when you go into the land you'll fulfill he um yeah my notes i don't know why i even have pages he says deuteronomy 4 and 12 and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire you heard the voice of the words but saw no multitude you only heard a voice and he declared unto you as covenant which he commanded you to perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that you might do them in the land whether you go over to possess it so so the word that came on mount sinai wasn't for the wilderness it was for the promised land right and it's the same thing with the with this word we have received it's not for us to be outside of christ and try and fulfill the word the word is for when you're in christ amen that is the that is the fundamental of a christian life is when you enter into that rest and god makes his word live in our lives amen so so there but so there was a season where when they came out of came out of egypt only a few of that generation really had faith they could go and take the land but they had church in the wilderness they had the mechanics there of church order how the priesthood sacrificed they had the tabernacle in the wilderness they had church and everything but only a few of that generation had faith that we're going to go take the land now when i talk about this i'm not talking about an age thing necessarily though it is on a dispensational level it's also on a personal level because i've known a few caleb and joshuas hallelujah 90 year old real warriors of the faith that believe and have actually gone and possessed a promise why they're not stuck up in legalism church fights and different things but they've pressed on and gotten every promise for them amen but now we're living in a caesar where it's not just a few have crossed jordan into the promised land really gone and received the holy ghost seeing the power of god manifested in their lives now it's a whole generation going in it means it's not just a few like it was caleb and joshua it's the whole group amen we know it's an individual walk though so we've got to keep that uh in mind but you see that moses was saying that you haven't been given eyes to see how to perceive ears to hear until this day though they had they had heard the word they had been sitting in church for 40 years they had been you know hearing all the doctrine hearing all the deep mysteries and things but they only given a heart to perceive at this season we're not going to cross it and take the fullness of the inheritance amen so this is this is the hour in which we live amen praise god amen nothing against those who who who have gone on in the faith i mean they had their portion but now we're living in a different season amen where there's a people that will go in and and actually possess every divine promise of god amen so the ministry of moses and joshua and israel's journey has repeated again in this end time amen not just on an individual level but on an age level where the believers have come out of egypt which types the world under the ministry of the prophet amen but have gone actually into possessed the promised land amen which we know our promised land is not the millennium right the promised land doesn't type the millennium because i mean there's war in the promised land there's killing you know when you read the story of the book of joshua who's read the book of joshua now i'm not talking now i know where i am i'm not i'm not isaac on jacob slater right now right you see that in the promised land this wars is fighting this bloodshed but in the millennium there's peace right so when we when we talk about the you know our promised land it's right now it's every divine promise in the holy ghost every divine promise in the word that we have we have been ordained to go and possess it not just talk about the promises but actually lay hold upon it amen become one with the promise amen so brother braham says in the message adoption he says now there's where the believer comes first he he comes first to a recognition that he's a sinner then he's separated by the waters the washing of the water by the blood or the washing of the water by the word rather believing on the lord jesus christ then being justified by faith pardon me he becomes a partaker and a peace with god through christ baptized in the name of jesus christ to admit him into the journey you get it into the journey then he comes a sojourner a pilgrim he's on his journey to what a promise that god made right so we start the journey we repent be baptized name the lord jesus christ for the remission of sin and the promises you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you start your journey like pilgrim's progress but that's not the end of the journey we don't just want to start we want to finish who wants to finish amen so so we start the journey but we don't stay there right we keep pressing on he says israel had not yet received a promise but they are on their journey um he says he says please do understand that's where uh you nazaring pilgrim holiness and so forth fell because israel when they come to the spot of kadesh barnia when the spies went over and said the land is great but some of them come back and said we can't take it because the cities are walled up and so forth but joshua and caleb stood out and said we can take it amen we're more than able to take it because they but because of their already signed up documents and statements they believed in two works of grace justification sanctification they could not move any further and listen the whole generation perished in the wilderness but two that went over into the promised land and brought back the evidence that was a goodly land and we are more than able to take it because it was god's promise then instead of the people going on receiving the holy spirit speaking with tongues receiving the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost signs wonders miracles they felt that it would break down their traditions of doctrine and that's what happened to it perished in the land that's right but the believers the caleb and joshua outfit was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land they took the land they settled down in the land as a possession and we never stop at justification or sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the holy spirit let's not stop at believing on the lord jesus being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we press into a position to a promise of the baptism of the holy ghost for peace to see the day of pentecost for the promises unto you and to your children and them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call that means we don't just want to stop at believing hey we have to believe we've got to receive him as our personal savior but the life that was in his blood must come into us change our lives amen and not just wash us from a life of sin but actually fill us that he now lives through our lives amen in the old testament the life that was in the bull or the goat or the lamb that the worshiper brought forth that could never change the believer's heart so so if he had done a sin i know he stole or whatever he did and that caused him to bring the lamb amen after that sacrifice was was offered on his behalf he could go away justified thanking god that that animal actually actually stood in his place and the wrath he should have received was poured out upon his sacrifice but it could never change his heart so so what caused him to fall and sin in the first place he still had that desire in him when he went away though he was justified friends we don't want to come to that place we want to go beyond that where the lord changes our heart i mean that that the bondage of sin doesn't keep us bound but now we're free because god has delivered us amen that we go back to it no more amen that's why we've got to press on not just leaving leaving the world under the blood not just going through the wilderness in a legalistic uh way and we and this is where we're really where we're going to go but we've got to cross jordan into the baptism of the holy ghost now we know that it takes the dynamic power of god to make the church move right it's more than just putting the machinery together you know you can get i don't know what the newest hypercar is in the world but you could have one of those and it could be the specs you could have all the specs of it it could be proven what it does but if it doesn't have anything to ignite the fuel if it doesn't have that spark plug that fire i mean to make it go down the road it might as well just be like some little matchbox toy on the shelf because it doesn't do what it says it can do i mean but we want to just not say what the word can do we want to see it live in our lives amen with the power of the fire the holy ghost firing the word to make it live amen that's what we want mean because it's not the mechanics that runs the automobile it's the dynamics that runs it amen and the mechanics don't run the church that's the dynamics this is from looking under jesus 1964 it's the dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word it's not a seminary that teaches you all the theology and greek interpretations there's a dynamics of the holy ghost in there to set that afire and to bring it to pass and make it live just exactly what that promised word is for this hour not the mechanics the dynamics it takes the mechanics and the dynamics the word and the spirit they are the one that gives life amen so we need the dynamic power of the holy ghost in our lives to make this world live amen but the problem is people have cabbage down on ideas against the moving of the spirit and they form denominational rings around ideas you know the biggest problem you can ever do you have a list of beliefs and put a full stop at the end we want to put a comma right because none of us have a perfect understanding of of the lord hey i'll be honest i don't you know the more you think you know the less the more you realize you don't know i probably get that mixed up but you know because you realize you think oh i think i know the lord now and you do but he's got more of himself to reveal and then he's got more then he's got more than he's got more and you realize oh lord just keep pouring it in i want to know you more right but we never want to put a full stop after our after what we believe because essentially that is what a denominational idea is a full stop and we don't want to have a full stop you know brother bam says i'd rather have the right spirit and the wrong doctrine than the right doctrine in the wrong spirit because if you have the right spirit and the wrong doctrine the lord because you have the right spirit you're teachable and the lord can lead you and guide you into all truth but if you have the right spirit in the wrong doctrine no one can tell you nothing and god can't tell you nothing either so we don't want to fall into that bracket we want to be teachable to the lord because remember the law is an individual he's an individual god he wants to lead us personally guide us into all truth you know i might only know the cover remember this is this is the lord jesus christ in print form i might only know the cover or maybe the first page but there's more of truth that the lord's got to guide me through right so i'm going to say lord keep guiding me into all truth i want to know i want to know you better i want to understand you bit i want a closer walk with thee amen granted jesus is my plea amen so we don't want to ever you know but people will say but but the prophet said this message will never denominate on an age level it won't but an individual absolutely it will and it has because people uh draw boundaries and they say unless you see it my way you're not seeing it at all and you're not part of anything and that's us for no more what is that it's the same as the church in the wilderness what did the church in the wilderness israel there in the wilderness what did they experience church splits right people wanting to go back into the world amen they you know they experienced corey and dathan raising up and they said to moses you think you're the only holy one in the in the bunch you know and moses said well you know god will god will prove who's whose side is suicide you know and and he said you know if god does a new thing and swallow you up you know i mean the earth swallow you up you'll see whose side is on whosoth and the earth the world swallowed up core and dathan we've seen that happen right people come against the word you know they say this is not this is how things should be and the world swallows them up you know we've seen church splits we've seen people want to go back into the world you've seen people like balaam come and and and he caused israel and and moab to bind together for israel to worship idols we've seen all that but that's in the wilderness god was still there god was still looking after his children guiding them through the power of god was there but you know that's far different than being in the promised land actually possessing their inheritance amen and so there's a big difference between being in the wilderness and being in the promised land though both in the wilderness and the promised land they had the same priesthood they had the same word they had the same tabernacle they had all those same things but one was in the inheritance one was not so we've seen down through since the prophet's been here church splits fighting people raise up with partial truth form denominational fences around things with full stops and all its causes fighting and division just like in the wilderness people fussing at conditions trouble all those things but there has to come a time when the church crossed the bride crosses into the promised land now i'm not saying we're about to i believe we're already in right we've got to have an understanding where we have been and where we are amen because we got to realize the world is falling apart for a reason right the world is not yo there's always a new normal i wish i had a dollar for every time people say new normal i'd be a rich guy you know but the world is ordained to fall apart it's been prophesied to fall apart but the thing is god is doing it because we're coming into a different season also amen of the of the catching away of the bride but before that catching away there's going to be a people on the earth that will possess every promise i mean irrespective of their mind battles their their whatever going on their peculiarities of of humanity there'll be a people possessing every divine promise amen so you know brother brahm says here he says he says now when we stop on one evidence of speaking in tongues being the holy ghost which is all right that's true that's the evidence of the holy ghost but just look at the other things that goes in there but as soon as we did we have to denominate ourselves to keep the others out build a fence around our coconut tree that nobody else can gleam off it but us that's the reason the rest of us don't get anywhere it's our own selfish ideas instead of letting the holy ghost lead us all out and we've waited for 40 years and nothing's happened we're still you're still staying in the same place the same old thing they went around the same mountain for 40 years the lord actually said you've come past this mountain long enough but they went round and around the same old thing you know i believe this you don't believe this this is me you're wrong i'm in i'm out this is happening and winds of doctrine coming through trouble about the same old thing going in and out but that season has come to an end that season's come to an end amen now we find out they made a fatal mistake and they raised up a bunch of fighters and that's what we have a big bunch of fighters you say bless god i'm assemblies you're the oneness we won't have anything to do with you your old church of god we got it the church of god bless god we're the ones who got it we got the prophesied name the one that says we've got it because we're baptized right hallelujah you bunch of fighters god just let you sit right out there till you die that's exactly right the bible said they stayed there till the old fighters died out amen that's exactly right he let them stay right there till all the old fighters died out the bible said so those fighters fighting over their organization boundaries and don't you have no fellowship with that group that buzzard roost and this so and so as long as you've got that in your head you'll just sit right there on the mountain and starve to death i don't want to be in that category did you ever think of those people done for 40 years not even 40 days away from the promised land and god kept them there 40 years and that and that's what it was a long time ago but the same thing has happened today you know people you know people drew fences around the seventh hills openers or or it's closed don't talk to those group they're not seeing it they're the fullest virgin we're the wise virgin stay away from them you know then people drew fences around the gifts not needing to be operated in the church no more i believe the gift should be in the church i don't believe in taking twink and whiting out the word why you know why why why rob ourselves from the power of god i mean people drew themselves around you know the thunders or the perugia different specialty doctrines have risen up that point just to a man instead of the word of god you know that no one should preach anymore the ministry should just be playing tapes they put a full stop behind it and you know what's that people building fences i've got my coconut tree don't let anyone else have anything off it and what's happened is people get stuck in that kind of condition but those days have come to an end i mean we're not living in that kind of day we're living in a day where every divine promise amen is ours to take the land is good amen as sweet as honey hallelujah the grapes are great amen all the blessings are tremendous amen there's an inheritance in us for in the word of god not just to sit in the wilderness you know brother chris says he doesn't like sand and you know i wouldn't like to be in a desert either you know i'm not saying you are but yeah who likes sand i'm not a dip maybe i'm used to new zealand i like green and you know lush things and you know maybe sand on the beaches all right but just there i wouldn't want to live and just look around and see sand all day we're living in a different place see they put a full stop behind us but you see god brought them to a stage just like israel says now you've been given a heart to perceive so now you can look beyond all these fusses and fights and and ring fencing and don't talk to this group in this group it's more than that it's now we're going to cross the land let's put aside all those things you know i could be a denomination in myself let's put a full stop i could be let's i mean let's be honest people people do that it's not just a church or a movement or no you can be a denomination in yourself you know this is what the message is full stop no no comma and whatever god will add or take away i'm happy with that as long as he's leading i mean so you know we never ever want to see because the fruit of this is the power of god isn't there to save souls the power of god is not there that we grow in our christian walk yes you know the power of god does not cause us to grow in the lord jesus we want to grow amen we want to see the power of god save souls i mean we want to see the manifestation of the gifts of the spirit people say oh we don't need that no more we need it we need god to manifest himself not just in preaching not just in wisdom i mean but in discernment tongues prophecy speaking in tongues whatever it is i mean discernment amen helps whatever it is i want to see all of god manifested i don't just want an arm i don't just want to i want the whole body amen so we must never put a full stop after what we believe amen you know people would put a fence around oh the mystery of the baptism of holy ghost without sensation but that's not the whole quote but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did i mean so he cast out devils that work should be in you amen he healed the sick that work should be in you he raised the dead that work should be in you amen he he leap for joy and rejoice that work should be in you he was led by the spirit of god that work she definitely should be in you amen he surrendered himself to the father's will that work should be in you and i am amen well are you saying we should go to a graveyard try and raise the dead and no no as the lord brings it across your path amen the lord will anoint you no and i believe it will happen just like healing or anything amen but you know so we don't want to just put a full stop behind anything we want to keep growing amen because we know the baptism of the holy ghost is a definite experience where you can look back and something happened in your life you're now now a different person amen so the apostle paul would say in hebrews 3 or 4 we read there they couldn't enter into the promised land because of unbelief so they had to believe themselves they had to come a faith into their hearts amen and i believe that we have come to that place where there's now a faith in our hearts god is more than able i mean we're not interested in in in church brands fussing fighting what do they believe we believe different trying to find points of difference we're not interested in that because because if we're honest if we sat down long enough one-on-one we'll have an in we'll have a point of difference you get you can you can split it down to very fine things oh no they believe different than me of course because we're all maturing we're all growing right the lord reveals something to you but he may not reveal it to me until later that doesn't mean you're wrong doesn't mean i'm right doesn't mean you're right doesn't mean i'm wrong right god reveals his word sovereignly to us as we walk with him amen so the wilderness as i said is it it's it's symbolic of the time when a believer is sanctified from the world but it's also the legalistic time in a believer's walk and i believe well i pray when we talk about this you say thank god i'm not that guy anymore because we have all had this walk i mean i mean this time in our walk which is a legalistic time now that's where people try and please the lord in their own strength they try and bring everything they've got to the table say lord you're obligated to me because i've done such and such but we know that you know serving god or actually trying to get the blessings of god is not like a a reward card from a cafe you know i've done such and such god so therefore you're obligated to heal me well i've done such and such and such i've prayed this long god listened to this much gone to church this myself or you've got to save my loved ones it doesn't work that way it's not a reward system right it's god's sovereign grace amen so now you know so in the wilderness as i said i mean there's a big difference between being in the wilderness and being in the promised land though it can look similar as i said because they had the same tabernacle they had the same worship they had the same word they were the same people but the conditions were very different now there's a massive difference between a person who's really crossed jordan entered into rest really met the lord and those who have not now as i said in the beginning the true rest is receiving the baptism of the holy ghost amen and it's not just being anointed by the holy ghost but the holy ghost himself continually dwelling in you see it's easy see it's and it's not shown by how a person acts in church in the presence of god hey when god comes down a powerful way we can all raise our hands and shout and scream and give him praise right but that's not proven in that moment if you have the holy ghost or not it's proven in your everyday life right it's how we are how our character is how we treat one another the things we do afterwards that's the proof of the pudding amen it's the it's who you are afterwards that counts it's not who you are hey we can have camp and we always have an awesome camp don't we yeah like that sunday night at camp i thought well we're going in a rapture now you know such an incredible powerful anointing there it's easy to praise god and be a christian in that kind of atmosphere at camp you have no struggles you've got no temptation there's no trouble there it's just like heaven on earth but that doesn't prove what you are it's when you we go out into the world go back to everyday life go back to school go back to our job whatever it is that really proves what we are it's the afterwards that counts i mean so this younger generation had to cross the jordan and go into the promised land and so they had to leave legalism and go into the baptism of the holy ghost that god would really manifest the word in their lives see legalism to me it's a pulling or pushing people down there's no grace in it because if grace has truly been imparted grace can be extended right so the so forgiveness has been has been imparted it can be extended right but great but legalism always tries to pull or push someone down you know the tall poppy syndrome of new zealand is such a curse and and and and it weeds into legalistic believers so good and even liberal ones too where someone a gift starts to manifest in someone's life and because it's not them yeah you know they want to cut that person down i say let everything bloom let it bloom hallelujah let everyone come to their full position in christ let every gift have its way if it's singing musicians prayer warriors deacons whatever it is helps government sunday school teachers just let it come to its floor let it let it mature and grow to its full extent you know i don't want a bunch of stunted kind of you know a garden i want to grow fully right you know you're never happy when you go out to your strawberry plant and you got these little withered strawberries and you know you want to grow in its fullness you want to help that plant grow because you want to have the fruit right it should be the same thing with you and i we want to see the fruit of god manifested amen so it's a it's a pulling or pushing you know it's criticism some people say i'm just being discerning now often people are just critical because discernment doesn't just show the problem that shows the solution to the problem hallelujah and that's the thing but to be critical it's easy i mean i've given you probably so much material right now to criticize me and that's why just me walking here you know so it's not being we want to be discerning that the lord gives us and you say well i don't have the answer pray amen prayer is the greatest prayer changes things prayer changes things more than we realize people say oh i've got to go sort that out no has had the lord has the lord shown you how to sort it out and is it is it is it if it's summarized then i'm going to deal with this person i'm going to put them in their place that's not the lord sorting it out right judgmental attitudes that's legalistic we don't ever want to have a judgmental attitude condescending looks and comments that's legalistic because remember legal is like the pharisees they want and the well you know they wanted to look because they you know they dressed in all the great robes they outwardly publicly they prayed so prayed so nice and did things they wanted to look the best and that's a legalistic attitude you know judging by appearance and not by righteous judgment jesus said don't judge by their parents but judge righteous judgment you've got to look beyond what you see with your eyes i mean so those kind of things those kind of things is a legalistic way where people think because they they they adhere to certain parts of the word then therefore they have a right that you know they've arrived but if the lord comes into your life it's not you trying to appear to the word it's the lord adhering to the word in you right you know it's if you surrender to him he changes you he's the christian in you do you no i hope that's not a vague thing you know it may be once upon a time when in your legalistic stage you had to keep yourself from things right because you know but when the when you really enter into rest you can be around that same thing but it doesn't bother you no more well it's happened it's not you trying to keep yourself from it as i've said you know i used to you know make home brew i used to drink a lot and stuff but you know when the lord took that desire out of my life i could live in a brewery and i'd be the most sober man in the world because there's nothing in me that wants it anymore and it wasn't and it wasn't me being told thou shall not thou shall not i was just like lord whatever is because i knew i didn't have the holy ghost at that stage i said lord whatever's contrary to your word and me take it from me so you can come and dwell on me and then so the lord said okay i'll rearrange what i want because i want to dwell on you amen so we don't want to have a judgmental attitude condescending looks and comments you know we should never ever want to be just the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff that is a legalistic attitude you know where where where you want to push the person off the cliff because you're annoyed at them and you're actually silently happy that they fall but now you're going to come along and pray for them and help them with the bottom of the cliff we never want to get to that that that is a legalistic attitude where we're actually people get happy when other people fall that's crazy that's crazy because remember whatever you give out you'll receive i mean like the book of proverbs i think says are they that dig a hole or a ditch they'll fall into it i mean so we don't want to be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff for anyone i mean we want to be at the top of the cliff we're going to be abseiling down if they go down the cliff we're going to go with them not in sin but we want to be there to try and bring them back up again amen that's what we want to do so but as i said grace can only be extended when it's been truly received if it has not been ex if it has not been ext received it cannot be extended right so but criticism can be freely given you know if someone is climbing if someone started their walk they may have just stumbled in here and they've started i want to be a christian yeah we don't want to push someone down you know if someone is you know you're climbing up jacob's ladder you know because it's from earth to glory brother braham says we climb up that ladder it was hooked on christ the others in heaven and we're going up the highway going up the ladder into glory right if someone is climbing up under you a legalistic person will try and put their foot on their head and push them back down because they're doing wrong things down there but no someone who really knows the lord will reach down and say come up the ears better up here come up where i am and don't just come where i am let me help you push you up a bit more hallelujah that's how we should be that should be our attitude [Music] amen see the same the same journey is actually um shown in the book of ruth where where ruth starts where she decides to follow her her mother-in-law naomi back to the promised land but then she comes into a stage where she's got to work in the field trying to find you know little bits of grain just to just to survive there's four stages of her journey ruth deciding ruth working then ruth resting at the threshing floor and then ruth being rewarded but the legalistic one of ruth working in the field that can be a bit where i can say in an age level a lot of the church has been stuck there but we have come to it but you but the thing is so she had to do work she became a legalist she was working in the field we know the field is is the word of god right and she was just trying to get a few handfuls because the gl you know she was just gleaning in the field and she's just trying to pick up a few promises to take it back to her mother-in-law just for them to survive on and that's someone who is who is just in a legalistic framework they haven't entered into rest yet there's only maybe one or two promises that they just pick up and they're holding but you know we are told to stay in the field which is the word of god right but the thing is the thing is once she married boaz she was she wasn't just living off a few grains that had fallen on the field she was living on the whole field because that field was now hers right it was now her possession because it was her husband's possession so it's like someone who hasn't entered into rest yet they are clutching a few promises trying to survive amen but those who truly enter into rest are living off the whole field amen amen that whole field is their possession the whole word of god is there are you all following me right so maybe maybe the only promises they have is well god sent a prophet long hair long skirts long faces you know that's you know and they're just living off this and if no one listens to you no one tally's up to what they think they're they're not even in the field but once you once you actually get married to boaz the lord jesus christ the whole field falls into your possession and now you're living off genesis to revelation amen you've got the joy of the lord you've got everything that he has is now in your possession hallelujah so she wasn't she didn't have to go out in the field and just try and hold on to a few promises every promise was in her was at her fingertips hallelujah amen so she had now access to the whole harvest once she married the lord of the harvest amen hallelujah but you see now when when when israel came to uh when israel came to the river jordan under joshua the priests would take the ark and they walked into the jordan and at that time of year was it was the jordan was flooding but the but the priest carried the ark into the jordan and the and the river parted right and it was like dry ground now everyone knew where to cross but they had to cross right they had to physically cross now jordan we know represents a death to self in order to cross over into the promised land you've got to die out to everything of your life good and bad ugly and different whatever it is you got to fully die out you got to open yeah just like brother ram said you know there's there's many parts of your heart you've got to open it up private life what you believe selfishness pride whatever it may be every part of your life you've got to open it and say lord take all of me you know and and that's a true death to self when you're willing to let him be lord over every aspect of your life so they saw where the where the where the priests had you know were standing they saw where to cross but they had to cross now to cross you've got to pray pray through and die out because we've seen we've seen the word part the jordan haven't we amen we're you know we've had a prophet come in this day the ark is being placed there in the river jordan there's now a way to go through a death to self into the promised land right repent be baptized name the lord jesus christ you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen so now they had to cross and once they crossed they were living they were living off the the corn and everything of the land they weren't living off the manor anymore so they were feeding so so they are now living off the evidence of the land right brother bam says improving his word don't you see in shadow stop here for a minute in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest we're now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man so now the land we know is the holy ghost which is the lord jesus christ so now the believer that crosses over jordan is now living off i mean the word himself where it's no longer living in the wilderness and criticism splits in trouble and fussing and fighting and inward looking and you know because all most of the trials they had in the wilderness was inward-looking core and dathan raised up inward looking you know they were yo we don't have water we don't have this there's all trouble that was within most of it i mean but then once the people actually rose up on faith they said we can take the land their enemies were without and they went and possessed possess their land so if you're always looking at inward trouble you've got to cross jordan right because because our purpose should be every divine promise i want it right healing is wonderful i want more i want salvation for my family i mean i want to be positively placed in in my inheritance amen i want i want all that god has i want a peace that passes understanding it's all in the land a joy unspeakable full of glory in the land i mean speaking of speaking in tongues is in the land interpretations in the land prophecy is in the land the sermons and the land aiming gifts of knowledge are in the land healing the raptures in the land amen the dead in christ rising that's all in the land and we want all those things to live you know but the problem is with a legalistic idea is people aren't willing to let god have his way and that's been the biggest problem see people always have used an excuse of what pentecost has made with the gifts and swung the other way because they don't want that in their church but that's an excuse to me because really what it is that's just a scarecrow but people are afraid to let go and let god have his way they're actually afraid to surrender and let the holy ghost move through them and do what he wants to do amen but we should never get in that position i may stay there's a bit of a stinger but you know if you're not in the land that's how you'll be you want to control you can have the church order everything right but if you're in the wilderness you want control and i'll show this because you know there is there is um a couple of tribes that did not cross jordan and and it's here in numbers 32 um there's the children of reuben the children of gad and half the tribe of manasseh they did not go over jordan to actually dwell in the promised land and the reason they did this is because they had very much cattle and the land that they were now in had was perfect for cattle so they wanted to take what they had in the wilderness with them into the promised land that's a mistake we can't take our old life with us we can't bring it in it's got we've got to die out to the whole thing and then the and then the um elders of these tribes they went and spoke to moses and said and said we want to stay here because it's a land for cattle and we have cattle now moses moses was upset with them because he said that this is what your fathers did when i sat there from kadesh bania to see the land so he's actually identifying the spirit that was in their forebears that caused them not to cross the land was now manifesting through the younger generation and that's why they did not actually want to go into the promised land he says numbers 32 and 8 you don't have to put it up but you can read numbers 32 to see this whole story but at the same time we won't read it he said thus did your fathers when i sit there from katy spania to see the land and he says the numbers 32 14 and behold you are risen up in your father's dead an increase of sinful men to to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord towards israel so moses was identifying a spirit that was in the previous generation was still because the problem is people die spirits don't die and we don't want to just inherit what our forebears have done hey there's a lot of good what they've done nothing do we understand what spin gets their previous generation know do we understand this i'm not putting them anywhere but i'm just saying we're in a different season but we don't want to continue on in the wilderness we want to go over the river jordan into the promised land so now the lord was moses was identifying that the same spirit and the spies that said we can't take the land that spirit of unbelief was now in these tribes and that's why they want to stay on the wrong side of jordan now it's amazing when you come down however many hundreds of years after this fact and jesus was crossing the sea of galilee he went from the western side to the eastern side and there was a man there that we call legion who was full of devils and and and he lived in the tombs and he cut himself crying out he was he was he was possessed by demons legions of demons and there were hog raises in the in the land there that were that were believers but then what happened is when jesus crossed the sea because he knew there was one soul crying out in that place for deliverance and if there's one soul crying out for deliverance jesus will cross the world amen to to find that one soul and he won't leave them bound he'll loose them amen because if there's a cry in here there's there's one to answer that cry and so now jesus cross crossed the sea and then this maniac came out of the tombs and then so jesus would speak to him and he commanded the devils to come out and then the devil said well can we go into those that herd of swine because the devils want to you know god has to work through people and the devil will work through anything right he's got to have a host too too to inhabit and then so the lord consented to these to these to these devils to go into these pigs right and so the devils went into the pigs and the pigs wouldn't drown themselves in the sea and then now the farmers of these pigs saw this whole thing go on so they saw legion be delivered then they saw their pigs run down and drown themselves and they ran back into the city saying this is what's going on and then they came back out and they saw legion who they had known used to be naked in the tombs cutting himself attacking people bound with chains he would break them and all those things he saw this they saw this man clothed sitting in the feet of jesus in his right mind no you would think that would cause them to rejoice and you would think that they would that would cause them to say jesus can you just stay here we won't let you go stay here we've got more sick we've got more troubles here you know you've you've healed this one he was an impossible case we all gave him up we had to kick him out of the church trouble he was too much we couldn't help him we didn't have what we needed to help him and joe he was a good man once upon a time but we just couldn't you know we had to he just it was too much trouble but now you've set him free so please stay here because we've got cases that aren't as bad as this but that wasn't there that wasn't their attitude they actually asked jesus please leave please leave what was what was the problem they valued their hogs at a greater value than the lord delivering someone they would rather have kept their economic system and how their church ran are you with me i mean you know they'd rather have someone in their church demon possessed and bound in trouble then jesus come in and change the whole picture and the reason they didn't want it is because it was outside of their control as i said you go into the promised land your life is no longer under your control and if you're in the wilderness i'll say people in the wilderness want to keep control of the holy ghost and the bible says quench not the spirit so we can't quench the spirit right and because of church order and trying to keep things you know how they think it should be people quench the spirit away from god actually working in the church now i'm not talking about how i'm talking about on age level right but we've gone past that amen so i would never so to me that's one of the hallmarks of someone who has not crossed jordan because remember um ghidara that place where that man was if i said it right is on the east side of jordan it's on the wrong side of jordan right it's not in the promised land it's in the wilderness and to me that's a hallmark of someone who's not across jordan as they're just like those hog races they're happy with the status quo of of people being in church hurting tormented and they're not happy when the law comes in and answers the bitter cry of someone for deliverance because that person's down there and i'm up here and they want to keep that person down there because i'm better than them god help us may we never ever get to that place where would rather leave someone in their pain amen than actually see them delivered but i'm persuaded we're living in a different season i'm persuaded we are not like we are not like those hog raisers there i'm persuaded that we are like the samaritans where when the woman at the well came running into them come see a man who's told me all i've ever did this is not the messiah and then they begin to believe on him not because of what jesus said but because of what he has said to to them amen i believe we are we are those kind of people where we don't just want to keep a status quo but we want to see god live i mean we don't want to see people just push down oh that's a teenager there's a young person oh that's an old bob yeah they're just stuck in their ways we don't want to have that attitude towards anyone i mean but we want to have such a such a burden lord jesus is more of the promised land for me and i believe there's more of the promised land for them hallelujah and let's take our swords amen let's possess every promise let's see god live like never before amen that's how he should i'll say if you've been around the mountain you've been around it long enough turn northward as the word says cross jordan amen and live off the goodness of the land the baptism of the holy ghost amen because every promise of god is in that land every promise and every promise of god we have fallen here to because we're joint is with jesus christ hallelujah amen so let us press on and if you're in the land there's more to possess right we will keep possessing promises till these bodies are changed we're not called to plateau we're not called just a coast we're called to grow into the fullness of the statue of christ and the lord is here to cause us to do so i mean so this is not you know we can be intimidated you know people get intimidated how can i be the bride of christ how can everyone come you know perfect because jesus said be perfect as my father in heaven is perfect well the only way we can become perfect is because he gave a perfect sacrifice to make us perfect amen that's right but i just want to say friends we are living in a different season we're not here this is not a time in the church and you can you can look back anyone who's been a christian for very long you can look it back even just this country what it used to be it's not what it used to be there's no unity there's there's now fellowship between churches between believers camps and things happen it's just one body there's not just oh what are those people doing here and division and you know there's a spirit of unity coming why it's because we've gone through the wilderness all that's dead we've crossed jordan we're now taking the land hallelujah so but if you haven't crossed jordan i say here's your time just die out to everything say lord i wanna i wanna go
