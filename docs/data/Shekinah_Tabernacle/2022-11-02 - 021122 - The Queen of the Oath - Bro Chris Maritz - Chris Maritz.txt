you can have your seats we're going to have a second testimony service so there are any testimonies you can come up foreign but I I really want to share this and this is actually Daniel's little testimony so the last day of camp the right at the end there um there came a guy in with a motorbike and um the little man as he is he climbed on onto the motorbike but he stepped with his foot on the exhaust and it burned his foot underneath and he was quite Brave about it and I eventually got into it I was looking for him and he was in the kitchen and he just he was crying he was he's so sore so we put it under water and um he I prayed for him I said ask him if I can pray for him so and then we put on some aloe vera and um went to the hall helped the men just finish up with the packing and about half an hour later he started really crying and he was just complaining about how so his foot is and he we've I've put more aloe vera on and um just tried to calm him down and we went home we went to this rivers and he was I said to him okay so you need to stay off your foot now you can't play you can't jump you can't run you just need to and it was good for a little while doing that and later on he came to me said okay he said I believe it's not going to be sore anymore so I'm gonna go play I said okay I said Do you believe it's not going to be so he said yep I believe it's not gonna be so anymore I'm gonna go blind okay you believe I'm not gonna stand in your way praise the Lord he didn't cry no more there was nothing the food healed very very nicely so um yeah amen praise the Lord [Applause] um my testimony is still ongoing um but um the week a few days before Camp I drove all the way up to Tauranga for a jury service and um my cat kind of had a few issues then um and but I wasn't too concerned and then um left on Friday from Tauranga six hour drive um left at eight o'clock I think it was and to drive to camp and I was an hour away from otaki and the temperature gauge I'm like I keep climbing and climbing and um I was like to Stella my sister I was like can pray for my car please because I'm not stopping and so I keep blasting the heater um and got to Camp um okay and then come Monday tried to start it and there were quite a few issues that didn't want to start then um but the brothers helped me and um we got it going and um I got to brother adaman's okay and then I was able to leave and I got back home so in total my car had driven about eight hours and it I took it into the mechanics the next day and he said it's completely shot like take it to the Wreckers so um and I picked it up and he said are you going very far with it and I was like No just around the corner and he's like good it's she's not gonna make it far so I was so grateful to the Lord that I made it all the way from Tauranga to Camp because I didn't want to miss it for a silly materialistic car so I was so grateful to the Lord and I know that everything's ordered and everything is so timely so I'm so grateful [Applause] God bless you all I'm not really the type of person to come up but I just wanted to um justify what the Lord did for me um okay so in the past camps have always been such a blessing to me but um I just noticed that in my heart there'll be like not a big change in it so I'll just keep going back into the world and all its influences and it'll just be it's like the Lord just telling me if it's fully surrendered everything to um him yet and when I went to Camp I was just praying for such a personal experience with the Lord because that's what I wanted and um on Saturday night um fear was spoken and I was so amazed because there was something that I needed like I didn't even realize how much fear had overtaken my life and everything and um it was so eye-opening to me and um that's when I realized that how much fear had just been controlling my life and I didn't even realize it myself um and then on Sunday night I actually went up to the altar um it was after the service and the song service actually and I just went up there and out there and I was just crying and just wanting to give everything to him because I was done with this like trying to trust in my own will and everything and um I went up there and it was so amazing because so many brothers and sisters were praying for me and I knew that was the Lord and what was amazing was I believe it was the Lord um those actually uh tongues and interpretation and I think I believe that was the Lord speaking to me but just then like the spirit of the Lord just came with my life and I just I couldn't deny that wasn't the Lord because it really was and um I'm so thankful but out of the tongue's interpretation what I got was that the Lord was telling me that he has never left me and he will never leave me even in my lowest and darkest moments of my life and to have no fear and so that was just so amazing and it was like I wasn't myself anymore and um and then on Monday every girl was spoken and I was just so thankful because when the Lord slew Every Girl's old husband I could just it was so personal to me because it was like my old life is all gone yeah I just want to praise the Lord and God bless you [Applause] okay God bless everyone um I just thought I'll give a little testimony of um what happened to me at Camp as well um a few weeks leading up to campus was really busy trying to get everything sorted out and um the Wednesday before the Tuesday before Camp I was in a lot of pain and I've been really struggling with my feet for for a very long time and I have this constant pain on the exact same spot on the outside of my foot but on on both my feet on the exact same spot um and for years I thought it was the Orthotics that I was wearing and I've gone to podiatrists and stuff like that so um on the Tuesday I rang up Sister Barbara and I was and I said to her really can you do something for me because I've got a few busy days ahead with camping I really can't afford this pain any longer and I'm just in agony so um she got me to come in and she strapped my foot because um because of the condition of my food she said that she has to strap it so there is limited movement with my feet and I've got to stay off my feet for three days and I said well that's impossible because we've got camp and we've got the hole to set up and and there's just no way that I'm well if anybody knows me they know that I'll never sit down for three days with my feet up and do nothing but anyway um so I um had that done in the morning and um that night she said to me I'm not allowed to get away to anything like that it's got to stay totally dry for three days and I was how am I meant to shouting how am I meant to do anything and just now I just it's got to stay dry so anyway that night I accidentally got away tonight got so frustrated with the pain that I just ripped it all up and I was like I'm just just done with this and then the pain just got worse and um the Thursday and Friday I was I was in a lot of pain and I wasn't taking a lot of um medication and I and then I started to get the headaches which was so I had the headaches it was that I was taking pills for and then my feet was throbbing and I was just not in a in a good place but anyway um the Friday night after um the first message that brother Chris preached and I was sitting there thinking why am I accepting this and so I went up for prayer and um and I said to brother Chris you know this is this is what's going on with me and before he started to pray he said sister it's finished it's done and then he prayed and and I was thankful for that and it wasn't a miracle it wasn't the pain and gone the pain was still there and I was I was like okay Lord I've gone off a prayer and and and I believe that that I'm not healed and the pain would go and the next morning I woke up and the pain was gone there was literally no pain there was just no pain and so I was walking around the Saturday and there was no pain and I wasn't thinking about it when I sat down I felt pain again and I was like oh my face my feet are so sore and the minute I said that the pain just came back and I've realized that every time I've said that the pain comes back and so I was talking to Christine about it and I said I don't know what to do I keep every time I walk and I feel the pain and I think okay the Pain's then the pain just comes back all the time and she said you gotta just believe and just say every time you feel that just sit down and say thank you Lord for my healing and since then I've done that and I've had no Pace I'm so thankful for that and I've just um I'm sure my family is gonna love that because they constantly are they constantly have to massage my feet because my feet so sore but I haven't had to ask them to do that so I just so I just want to say thank you to the Lord for that it's really answered prayer [Applause] um so on Sunday brother Ben preached that um you gotta get the devil out of the house of your heart and you've got to clean it out and just let the Holy Ghost come in because otherwise the devil's gonna come and come back in again and actually it turns out that's what I prayed when I was at the front I prayed that the Lord would clean out my heart and get the devil out and come into my heart and the devil wouldn't come back in again and I believe that he's doing that I know there any others okay I have my own testimony so um last week Wednesday I was in English just at normal school day and I was just wearing my headphones just listening to music and then I had my next period and then I had lunch and as I sat down at lunch I saw my zip my bag zip was open and I was like oh okay it's just closed and then when I closed I realized that's where my headphones I put them so when I zipped the back open my headphones were gone I was like okay so I went to all my friends asked them hey are you pulling any pranks it's not funny anymore and they're like no no we're not so they're all packed out their bags although I didn't ask them um and uh they're like oh it's not here it's like okay so uh I went afterwards my friend Lachlan and me we all went and just we went and just had a lock all around and asked everyone and went to the office and there was nothing so for the few days after that I just well every day I just kept going back to the office asking hey is it come back here to sit there and like no and I started praying and that the afternoon I lost I was also praying that it would come back and then um and it was a dinnerless camp I think no it wasn't and then um so then Monday night we had the with the youth had the the prayer service the prayer night and while it all Halloween and everyone was going around we didn't get any knocks so that was pretty good that because they would have met the Holy Ghost instead of the other ghosts but um so then I put I put that up for prayer and then there so then that night Ben Ben Bailey he prayed and he said that whoever wears the headphones will feel convicted and that they'll know that it's been used for something more than they could and they can imagine and that it's been used for the glory of God and I was like amen and I believed it and then Tuesday we we were um so yesterday we were with the the Milam's and the maritzas and we had gone to wairarapa and showed them around and then this morning I went to I went to school and I was actually pretty upset because I was like I want to go with the others and go to Wellington and I was all mad and then I was just having and then I was just the grumpy guy at school and then it came after my interval morning tea I sat down in my form class and my friend comes up to me and he says oh I got something for you she walks up to the front and goes under the teacher's desk and he pulls out my headphones I was like oh so where do you find that and he goes I don't know if the it was just sitting there yesterday morning or just sitting on the desk I was like oh okay so I asked the teacher where she found it and she says no before I had any classes I walked in and your headphones were sitting there so and that was the morning after the our prayers our prayer night and she says no classes came in so you must have just left it then I was like but I didn't leave it here I used it after my film class so class after that and she said no no but it was here before the classes so I don't know how that happened I was like well I know how it happened there was the Lord so um yeah that's pretty cool so now I've got my headphones back and I just want to praise the Lord for that [Applause] let's stand and then as we call brother Ben up [Music] you will [Music] never leave I am not alone I am not alone he will go before we will never leave I am not alone we will go before [Music] I am not enough [Music] Hallelujah and you're glad you're not alone he'll never leave you nor

what God is doing in your life just really appreciate your friendship brother amen how many years excited about the word tonight well this evening will be just a little bit different I want to speak a little bit in on the lines of of more of a reflection we just look at some of the events that have taken place and just reflect a little bit tonight you know and I think it's good after camp that we we look ahead now let's look ahead and see what the Lord's doing for us and then let's keep pressing the battle I'm so thankful for what God did at Camp amen and we're rejoicing in those wonderful things God is faithful amen and I enjoyed those testimonies tonight amen may the Lord continue and finish the work amen let there be a performance of the things that he has spoken amen and this evening we want to look at this uh if we can title it this evening the queen of the oath the queen of the oath and we'll have some slides for you this evening and as you can see on the slides there there's the Buckingham Palace and there's great statues there in front of it but if you notice there's there's two rainbows going over the palace there and this is right at the time of Queen Elizabeth II passing away and yeah and right at that time as as they were announcing these things and it was becoming world news there was these two big rainbows and I and I thought when I saw that I thought of the the Covenant that we are under which is Grace Grace amen we're under an oath we're under a covenant as the bride of Christ we're the queen amen you know in the world was so affected by that Queen's passing and I wonder man what's what's it going to be like when the when the world realizes the queen of God who she is amen and so this evening it'll be just a little bit of a reflection to look at some of the events and see you know I because I personally believe and you'll find that I'm maybe a peculiar this way but I believe that when things happen especially on that scale God is trying to tell us something you know he's trying to point out this that the certain event that means something not just for the world but for you amen because they're parallels you know as there's Queen out there there's the queen of God also and so we just want to look at this and I trust will encourage you this evening if you'll turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Matthew 12 and 38 Matthew 12 and 38. amen you know we're we're so thankful that we have eyes to see you know the world is just taking one day at a time and and trying to survive and trying to cope and trying to figure out what the next step is and how to keep the economies going and you know it's like Ahab and his Chariot you know he's bleeding out he's dead but you know they propped him up in that part that poor guy they propped them up in that Chariot and they try to you know keep the you know they're trying to keep the soldiers fighting trying to keep them inspired but you know all you have to do is take a good look at Ahab and say man he's not himself you know that leader is he's not acting right you know something's off with Ahab you know he's bleeding out in his Chariot and that's like the economies of the world the world's falling apart again and again and again you know my brother and sister and it's and it's exciting for us because you know we look at these things and and we see it with different eyes we we say wow isn't this what the what the prophet spoke about isn't this what the scriptures told us would happen amen so let's lean a little bit from the word like that tonight amen Matthew 12 and 38 it reads like this then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee 39 says but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall be no sign given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas so you'll notice right away that God is very careful to make sure that he leaves signs or memorials for the people to when they come to a certain Junction in time they'll remember hey what about this and what about that scripture wasn't Elias supposed to come first right in verse 40 says and for us Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's barely so shall the son of man three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth in verse 41 and the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold the greater than Jonas is here now notice verse 42 the queen of the South shall rise in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the outermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here amen barrage one more time gracious Heavenly Father we bow before you Lord humbly this evening looking To You O God recognizing the events taking a place around us we see Russia we see the Ukraine we see the Vatican we see the World Council of churches and we see this queen that has passed away just recently Lord and we recognize oh God you're doing something Lord Lord you're on the move oh God nothing happens by mistake or by accident oh God but that you allow it Lord and it's supposed to inspire us we're supposed to look up Lord because our Redemption draws nigh we see pestilences we see wars and rumors of wars Lord let us be encouraged tonight Lord that this you're not a dead God but Lord that you're on the Move Lord You're a living God lord and even the whole world Lord is governed by a word Lord and nothing happens and nothing escapes your word Lord but Lord your word and your thoughts dictate the events and the times and you're behind every move that happens out there so Lord we're excited tonight Lord let us just be encouraged a little in your word this evening let us find strength in your word tonight Jesus Christ's name amen you may have receipts amen try not to get too excited I want to just kind of go through this a little methodically this evening and just kind of leave you something to think about if that's all right with you I want to give you just something to think about so when we leave we go back to Canada you know just think about some of these things and Ponder them amen what time are we living in what what generation are we in you know what are some of these events that are taking place you know it's they're not for they're not to cause us fear these events are not the cause of fear or worry you know for the world it causes great fearing anxiety in these things but for us it gives us Direction I mean it tells us where we're living what position we're in and what timing is is is taking place amen so we see that that God has gone Witnesses from every generation you know one day listen let's not mistake this this is very important this this is absolutely critical because and at Judgment Day on that day God is going to have witnesses stand up and and attest to these things that God's word is true amen and he says you're the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation with this generation oh my can you imagine that Queen rising up in that day with that generation with her people and that that people that was alive at that time and we'll be able to say Solomon was right Solomon was right everything Solomon said by the word of God through his wisdom was right all the discernments all the prophecies everything he declared unto us was right and he says a greater than Solomon is here and that scripture is true tonight that there is a greater than Solomon the wisest man of all time amen truly inspired by God Godly given wisdom and man that had the gift of wisdom amen and to think that a greater than Solomon is here Exodus 4 and 8. let's move forward here a little bit and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign look at God's grace how that how did God bring signs and wonders and he knows how to attract the attention of the people great Pentecostal movements and outpourings of the Holy Spirit God pouring out his love and trying to do what trying to attract the people trying to show them I'm moving something's happening amen these Miracles and all these things they're not just for for bragging rights and for niceties and just to help us cope a little bit in life God uses them for a reason for a purpose and we see how he did that in the great Exodus Moses on the scene and and the great plagues that took place in the the death angel that came through the land and and then all the signs following thereafter and and God was doing all that to prove his presence with his people amen and he's saying even how that if they will not believe the first signs he's going to bring more signs you know God is faithful God is gracious that way verse 9 says and it shall come to pass if they will not believe these two signs neither hearken to thy voice that thou shall take of the water of the river and pour it out upon the dry land in the water which thou take us out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land we see how God just continues to give signs and wonders and be gracious and I believe that we are living in a time of great grace amen we think of how Israel you know with those paratroopers went up that hill on the on the on that mountain they put that flag of Israel the sixth pointed star of David on that in that Temple Mount amen that's a great moment because the prophet said when you see that flag the six-pointed flag flying over Jerusalem he says it's over and nearly these paratroopers in 1948 take that flag and they and they they put it on there and and what happened the government tells them hey take the flag down take the flag down right because why because we weren't here yet we weren't here yet we still had to be saved we still have to come in so we see we live under a great oath we're the queen of the oath or the Covenant God is is showing his great grace towards us amen oh my God Amen Prophet says this in the message the Rapture 1965 right before he's closing uh his his ministry he says I do believe that we are living in the closing scenes of the history of this world I truly believe that the coming of the Lord is closer perhaps than we think 1965. where are we sitting tonight hey man do you feel the change in the seasons the change in the weather is just a little bit different out there people have changed you know governments have changed their Direction you know things have become really weird we saw something through covet we thought was never possible how did they control the whole world overnight the whole world was under subjection to their rulings so we see Seasons seasons are changing and and we see governments changing all kinds of things are changing and then on top of all this Queen Elizabeth passes away Queen Elizabeth II you know it's like the the second Eve you know all these things it's just perfect you see as we go through the the this event how how perfect the parallels are you'll have to forgive me because this is how my mind works you know I see I see God in types and shadows and events and and you know it just gives it gives encouragement and when we see those things we see the parallels in the scriptures amen now the important thing to remember is her name is Queen Elizabeth Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II you know I heard this news when I was driving down the road and and just delivering some prints for for our church and and I know and and as news came on that Queen Elizabeth has passed away and the thing that really caught my attention they kept saying this over and over and I thought it was amazing this is the world saying this they're saying this is the end of an era just let that sink in for a moment this is the end of an era now the world it's just you know nobody ever really thought about her you know it's just kind of this Monarch and and she people don't really pay a whole lot of attention you know we we realize her position and we give respects to those things you know us being a Canadian you know we're still kind of under that Commonwealth and here in New Zealand you're under the same kind of Commonwealth you know so we're all attached to this queen we're all connected to this queen somehow you know but look at how the whole world stopped on the day when she passed away and acknowledged that we're at the end of an era how are we at the end of an era with a passing away of Queen Elizabeth why is the world saying that and everywhere you you look this was a great event everyone was distressed and and saddened and people started gathering around the palace and they want to know where is she where's her body and and what's taking place what's the very next step and and people acknowledging that something great has happened something sad something we're losing someone what is God trying to show us huh it's the end of an era and I started to wonder what does this all mean it it got my attention you know we I started thinking about this queen and you know she was a queen that was known for dressing modestly huh just think about this for a moment she was known for that and and I'm just saying what what the world is saying amen these are the things they started to remember her by they remember her as being someone who always dressed for her role in other words she was royalty she was the queen right but she also dressed her part yeah yeah right they they acknowledged that they saw that she dressed differently from everybody right but this is the end of this era interesting she represented modesty she remained she she represented a signified an error that is passing away that's right someone who was devoted to her cause regardless of the critics not as many things we could say about Elizabeth tonight but I know some of you have probably done some research on her and regardless of the trials and challenges that she faced people were saying that she stood the test of time and we're not talking for your rule right like our politicians no no this is a long time 70 years 70 years my brothers and sisters that is a long time to be a monarch okay and hold that kind of a testimony to uphold it to be able to say that she stood the test of time think about what God is doing with his Queen and there's going to be queens that are going to stand there on that day they're going to say his word was true I I was happy to stand for him amen and think of this queen of the South she came from the uttermost parts of the world to see who the Solomon is I just love these testimonies love you Boris Johnson prime minister Boris Johnson I believe I think is ex-prime Minister Boris Johnson now he's he he left office that very week on the sixth all these numbers are perfect he left office that week on the sixth and he said in a statement that this is the saddest day the saddest day for the UK because the Queen's bright and Shining Light has finally gone out what an acknowledgment the Queen's bright can you imagine when when the this bride this queen leaves the face of this Earth and tribulation sets in the bright and Shining Light yeah sure yeah we're right at the ending of an era the this light that we have my brown sister is going to move out of here one of these days and tribulation is going to set in and people are going to go where is the Queen of Heaven where is the bright and The Shining Light we had what was holding back the wrath of God what was holding back tribulation and all these things what was holding back the mark of the beast it's the queen that's here but that error is ending right after how many seven Church ages and she reigned for 70 years God's trying to tell us something amen he goes on and he says she seemed so timeless and so wonderful that I'm afraid that we have come to believe like our children that she would just keep going on and on and on and sometimes in the message we feel like we're just going to keep going on and on but there's an end to this era also and then he starts talking more he says many are trying to feel figure out why are we feeling this way that's that's incredible huh these are politicians these are men of the world and they're saying we're trying to figure out why are we feeling this way he says it's right in the house of of Commons there I believe it was the the big house where they all sit and they and they talk back and forth argue about you know things but he said he's he stood right there and in front of all those people he says we're all trying to figure out why we're feeling this way why do we feel a great loss can you imagine when this queen will leave yeah many are trying to fill out figure this out he says what we have asked that 25 year old woman to do what we asked of her he says and then to think what she has given this country she showed the world how to love and to serve he says for many people she was a constant through many changes think about it 70 years 70 years being born in April 21 1926 she was 96 years old when she died on September 8th she would have seen a lot you know she served in World War II she navigated through some heavy scandals and family troubles also yet holding her own standards you go find all this out it's really amazing reigning 70 years her Reigns spanned 15 Prime Ministers and 14 U.S presidents just last week when prime minister Boris Johnson stepped down that would be a couple weeks a few weeks ago now the new prime minister was elected and her name is Liz so here the Queen Elizabeth leaves and the new prime minister is Liz why Elizabeth why Elizabeth why Queen Elizabeth II and why Liz and you're going to start seeing there's there's something I believe that God is trying to tell us Queen Elizabeth was only 25 years old when she became Queen she wasn't expected to become Queen but her uncle abdicated the throne okay we could say a lot about these things but let's keep moving here then her father became the king but he died leaving her the throne okay it range from six of February 1952 until the 8th of September the longest reign of any British monarch and the second longest in world history that's a long time you know I was I was driving along and and I think Brenda called me and and she said you know why do they say God Save the Queen and once she actually saved you know what what about her you know was she a Christian what you know so the question came up so and as she asked this question the news was was broadcasting her life and and went into how she was a Christian and how what kind of an example she was two Christians and basically the prayer of God saved the queen is is for God to protect the queen and give her a healthy long life obviously as a benefit to the nation I just hung up and and and the and the radio started talking about her Devotion to the Church of God and uh I believe it's Anglican the Anglican Church and then they were saying how that she she was a friend of brother Billy Graham so he can go look at all these things we know that Billy Graham was an angel to the to the churches as well and and just that she was a friend she had him actually in the palace there at a time and had conversations with him and all kinds of things but she was she was a believer in that sense this is a quote from her she said for me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life I like so many of you have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example it's amazing because the whole world is remembering these things that she said and did and then another person right at this time sent me a picture of the double rainbow over Buckingham Palace and I started to think Lord what are you trying to say who is this queen what was it all about then I and for me the connection was Elizabeth her name I'll just give you a few quotes right out of the message about what the prophet says about this queen Queen Elizabeth II he said just recently from England come to Queen she went up into Canada she visited all through Canada she came then to the United States and there would have been a person in the United States that would have would have every person would have loved to see that Queen when she visited he says what would you have thought this morning if the Queen of England he says though you're not one of her subjects he says you're an American subject but although what if she would come and knock at your door now look at the example he's using her for what if she wouldn't come and knock at your door he says and you would see her maids and so forth standing there and she would say I am the queen of England I am come to visit you what an honor that would be because of her importance she's the queen and one of the greatest Queens he says in the world is the Queen of England he says she has no power in this nation but because she's important you would be happy to let her in I'd be happy to let her in he says there's a lot of places you'll find he talks about this queen he speaks very highly of her but think of it tonight when you shook a brother or sister's hand coming into the door the queen of God all right just want you to ponder some of these things huh the testimony she left behind the the life she lived huh What About Us another place he says she's an important person she's the greatest Queen on Earth nationally speaking and we'd have to have to honor her we had to have an honor for her to come he says who who's more important than Jesus tonight Who's Who who's more turned away than Jesus and who is greater than he is right so using this parallel between this queen and Jesus Christ even another place he says she's the greatest Earthly Queen on Earth and anyone would feel honored why the newspapers would pack it everywhere excuse me he says the television would show it and that the Queen of England humbled herself to come down and knock at the door of some poor person's house another message he says you see though you're not at her subject but she's the greatest Queen on earth that is of the Realms of the nations of and he says England Queen of England the greatest Queen on the earth that we have today incredible what a what an acclimation to give of the queen her 21st birthday was was in 1947 which is when the message started to be recorded and she was in South Africa I knew there'd be some South Africans here tonight they probably like that but she was in a tour in South Africa during this time and in a speech in a broadcast on the radio and from Cape Town the princess dedicated her life to the service of the Commonwealth says I declare before you all before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and to the service of our great Imperial family to which we all belong so you might be asking Chris where are we going with this tonight Elizabeth means God is my oath and I want to talk about God's Queen the queen of the oath but her name means God is my oath or God is my abundance an oath remember is stronger than a promise an oath is generally something that is made between governments or royalties or in a marriage an oath is a solemn promise it's unbreakable in other words it's a commitment you cannot change it's a pledge unto another an oath ultimately means a guarantee in other words this queen her name means God is my guarantee so think about what what we carry with us we are also under an oath under a guarantee amen God is my guarantee so Elizabeth is really the connection for us tonight it's the name the meaning of this name now we can we're going to follow some of these names Through the Bible here this evening and you're going to find that find find a very uh incredible similarity between all of these and the connection is that their names mean God is my oath okay so let's look at this a little bit in Hebrews 7 let's go to the new New Testament Hebrews 7 11. if there if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron now this order of Aaron this he's a he's a great priesthood right amen God did a great thing through Aaron this was the the first setting up of of the government of God with his Tabernacle and making sacrifices making a way for the people he was the order of Aaron right and we see here that there's another order amen there's another priest coming after the order of of of Aaron but what is Aaron so let's go right back to the beginning remember Aaron's wife what was her name Ella Shiva it's like Elizabeth Shiva elashiba or God's name is l right you look at all the different variations of her name they they try and figure out how her name came to be and what her meaning is and literally these are the things you're going to find out that it's a combination of Elizabeth and sheba now what is the queen of the South who is the queen of the South is the Queen of Sheba so you're going to find this connection of the oath of God or the queen of the oath all throughout the scriptures under the order of Aaron amen remember Aaron's wife was named elisheva the oath or the fullness of God now it's important to recognize that she was the daughter of a minidab meaning that she was from a royal family okay so she was royalty in those days elishiba by marrying Aaron became connected to the tribe of Levi or the priesthood so she fell under that privilege of the priesthood Exodus 6 and 23 says and Aaron took him elishiba there's the name for you in case you want to see it in the scriptures there daughter of a minidab sister of nashan to wife and she bear him nadab and abihu elizar and ethamar another priesthood though is rising out out of the order of Melchizedek right so we're gonna I'm jumping in Leafs here because I just want to show you the connections and then you can go Ponder these things later so let's go back now to the New Testament because we know another priesthood is rising up Hebrews 7 and 15 says and yet it it is far more evident that for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there arrivesth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life so this is awesome because this is the priesthood that we have come under amen but look at how he describes the priesthood here or his rulership or or his care or Devotion to you in verse 21 he goes on this is from the Amplified just so you can see the more descriptive language he says and it was not without the taking of an oath see the queen of the oath right that Christ was made priest taking of an oath by God but this one was designated and addressed and saluted with an oath in other words a guarantee this priesthood was established with a guarantee the Lord has sworn and will not regret it amen or change his mind you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek so we are a queen under this priesthood amen amen but look at this I I love that he's it's he will not regret it he will not change his mind it's of an endless life right this is the queen this is the kind of Queen We Are in keeping with the oath's greater strength and force Jesus has become the guarantee of a better stronger agreement a more excellent and more advantageous sorry a more advantageous Covenant an oath greater strength and force my this is beautiful language through here go find out what kind of government we are under amen as a queen we are the queen of that oath of the guarantee of God all right verse 25 as 24 says then he holds this priesthood unchangeably because he lives on forever verse 25 sorry says therefore he is able also to save to the uttermost completely perfectly finally and for all Time and Eternity those who come to God through him since he is always living to make petition to God and intercede with him and intervene for them I mean I know it's amazing right okay verse 26 says here is the high priest perfectly adapted to our needs as was fitting holy blameless unstained by sin separated from Sinners and exalted higher than the heavens the queen of the oath and you think of what that man was saying when he said this is the end of an era amen this bride is leaving my brother and sister the bride of Christ we're reaching the end of an era amen the church ages have run out amen we're just living in the last few moments of this era the seven Church ages are finished amen we're at an end of an era it's all going to change amen and this queen of this oath is going to lift off out of here and go into another dimension oh my God oh my what's God trying to tell us if that Queen is left Elizabeth the queen of the oath amen amen it's it's changing time amen changing of administration time amen Hallelujah all right we can look at other elizabeths but even when the king of Heaven came down the word was made flesh there was an Elizabeth on the scene amen and God gave her a promise amen that a son would be born that her womb would bear fruit right and she was in Elizabeth right I loved that and she brought forth John the prophet of the day they would forerun the coming of the Lord right it's just perfect how this name Elizabeth shows up in our scriptures Hallelujah God trying to show us that he is God huh he's the god of his oath he made a promise to Elizabeth that she was going to Bear a child and he was going to be a great man amen and yet even though that child had died in her womb wasn't moving amen he gave him the Holy Ghost in his womb oh man brought it back to life why because he's the god of the guarantee amen if you're waiting on a promise tonight you're the queen of the oath of God Hallelujah the queen of the South so you can imagine when God said the queen of the South shall rise up now the queen of the oath the queen of the guarantee is going to rise up she's going to attest she's going to give have a testimony like night like we had tonight amen amen of God's faithfulness of his goodness praise the Lord all right so Queen of the South so the queen of the South and and other uh books so Luke or Matthew whichever one you're going to read the story from it'll it'll either say the queen of the South or the Queen of Sheba so Sheba the Queen of Sheba is a place Sheba is a place huh Shiva is mentioned in job 6 19. it's the country of Sheba job 6 19 says it like this the troops of tema looked the companies of Shiva waited for them what was happening at this time they they were waiting for water this country of Shiva they were thirsty it was a dry time a time of famine and and so they sent out troops and and Warriors and men to go and search out for water and the countrymen of Sheba were waiting for the reports and this is beautiful because this is exactly what happens with the queen of the South she was looking for more of God she was hungering after the Lord she was looking for water in a dry Place amen and right away in job in the Book of Job which is one of the oldest books in the Bible think about that amen before you know before all the histories began we find This Book of Job the oldest book in the Bible and what does it tell us that they're in the land of Shiva there was Messengers being sent out people were looking for water they were searching for something amen praise the Lord Shiva also means oath this country means the place of the oath I'm going to skip through these verses you can go read in job here about these people as they were going through so this place here means the the place of the oath or the seven the place of the seven right it's interesting Shiva seven seven Church ages making up a bride I mean it's just perfect how all this fits together right all right let's move on here oh my yeah we don't have time for all of us here this evening so anyway as as we're looking at Elizabeth Queen of the oath these events started to perk my interest all the Queens in the Bible we can talk about them tonight we don't have time for that this evening but this queen of the South you know it's incredible that the God could have used a lot of people from the scriptures and said he's going to raise that one up for in the day of judgment in other words at the very culmination of everything when it's all said and done this is the woman he's going to raise up the woman of the guarantee in other words if the guarantee didn't work for her right then it's no good but he's going to prove that his insurance policy his guarantee is good amen that he was faithful to the end the queen of the guarantee but I want you to remember look at the attitude of the queen of the guarantee the queen of the oath what was her attitude like First Kings 10 and 1. scribes her a little bit and says and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she heard about somebody amen and she came to prove him with hard questions in other words Lord who am I she wanted to know Solomon where did you get this wisdom how do you know these things how do you how do you open the word like that how do you discern the the thoughts and intents of the people's hearts how do you do these things Solomon she heard about the wisdom of Solomon and it wasn't just his his wisdom but she heard about the name of the Lord in other words through Solomon's wisdom there was a declaration of the name of the Lord the lord's name went out through all the nations and it tells us that she came from the uttermost parts of the world in other words the gospel went and was preached to the outermost parts of the world and here she comes now all the way to Solomon oh my the resource the the Fountain of that wisdom look at her attitude though right when she heard about God she said she was willing to come and sit at Solomon's feet and ask the questions who am I where am I going to end up what is my final destination what are your plans for me right the hard questions the question of life you know so where does she go she goes back to the beginning and she came to Jerusalem with a great very great train with camels that bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart that to me is beautiful I would have loved to sit in on that conversation she came with gifts and in other words she came with everything her kingdom everything her culture everything her life everything she knew she brought it to Solomon right she laid it all out there for Solomon she she found entrance to Solomon and the Bible tells us that she communed and she had fellowship with Solomon you know Solomon I've brought you everything that my life consists of all my history my peoples my my the spices of our country it's beautiful if you look at why she brought all these things you know she all those little things represent something of her history her past her identity she laid all those things out before Solomon and she communed with him everything that was on her heart the queen of the oath the queen of Shiva Queen of the South and Solomon told her all her questions in other words all the Mysteries were made plain all her questions were answered there was no more mystery anymore everything was made plain you see what God has done for us and to think that a greater than Solomon is here told her all her questions there was not anything hid from the King which he told her not and when the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built now this is beautiful right because she's sitting there we don't want to just read it tonight we want to look at what's really happening right what is happening there she's sitting there in in the in the presence of Solomon the wisest man in all the Earth who has now opened the Mysteries to her tell told her that the very secrets of her heart and there was nothing that was on her heart that he could not answer in other words somebody knew this woman amen knew all about her could see the very secrets of her heart right but look at this now she as she's sitting there and the story starts to kind of progress she sees all of Solomon's wisdom in other words all the Mysteries start to become made plain right in the days of the voice right all the Mysteries start to be open and there's no more question really about whose presence she's in but then she starts to see the Tabernacle in other words it's opened up the whole Plan of Redemption she sees his house you know what's important about that right the house but the Bible is very clear that she sees his house now she's a queen I'm sure she came from a big Palace and great things were around her and you know maybe you know if if another Monarch today went to another monarchs home you maybe not won't be that big of a deal because you know they're all wealthy and Rich and well established but she notices his house and the scriptures make sure that we see that in other words we see the house of the Lord you know when we come to God and I want to be very clear tonight that when we come with a with a humble heart like the Queen of Sheba and we come and sit at the Lord's feet and we say Lord here's every all my possessions and Lord I have questions and things on my heart God will answer all your questions for you all the things that are on your heart and and not just that then he'll start to open up the bigger picture amen the the pattern that was in heaven came down and was built in the as the house of the Lord where the Lord would dwell and she starts to notice that house and how that all works I was covered with Badger skins amen speaking about our human flesh and and she starts to recognize hey that that's not just the Lord's house that's me he's talking about me and all the the way it's built right she she starts to receive revelation oh my what a beautiful story we have here tonight look at this and she notices the meat of his table oh my where the where the carcass is the Eagles are gathered right she starts to notice the kind of food that he's eating and the sitting of his servants in other words the pillars right the the apostles and the prophets she starts to notice the position of everyone right that they're in his right hand the seven Messengers The Seven Stars the seven Church ages and she sees the seven candlesticks man she's standing she's she's like John being lifted up into the presence of God she can see the house she can see the sitting of his servants the meat that's at his table she's there in the Shekinah Glory where his meat never goes stale amen thank you and the attendance of his ministers oh my just like a Sunday morning service and brother Ben comes and preaches the word she notices those things amen praise the Lord and their apparel yes how they were dressed and his cup bearers and his Ascent oh that's interesting she recognizes the empty tomb from 2000 years ago he's a scent how he became King how he became Lord of lords yeah she notices his Ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her oh my what a time she was having what would cause the queen a queen to faint huh for her spirit to be changed you know for something to happen to her just looking at what he's doing looking at his whole plan and his Ascension oh my I believe you know this is an Old Testament scripture but look at how powerful it is tonight this is what God's done for us we've seen his Ascension we've seen how he sent his holy spirit back amen we see him in All His glory tonight his attendance I I'm so thankful that we see all of the seven Church age Messengers we see as prophets we see we see those who work in the ministry we see his attendance we see his musicians we see the mothers that pray and prayer meetings we see the young people who pray we see all these things we're living in the very Shekinah Glory of God oh my hope it's not just another church building for you tonight but we're in Heavenly places this evening amen your name is Shekinah a tabernacle Hallelujah this is where we live man when you when you leave this building tonight you're not just going home to your your house you're still living in the Shekinah Glory of God we're the queen of the oath my brother and sister the queen of the guarantee Hallelujah and everything Solomon told her would come to pass oh we're just getting started amen verse 6. and she said to the king it was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom it's nothing but the truth amen it's all true everything I've read about you it's true all the message books all the tapes I'm experiencing it I've met you in person now amen this is It's a reality now amen it's not just books or on a shelf anymore but I know you as the king of Jerusalem the king of Peace the king of Salem amen [Music] oh we could we could go on all night on those things hey man verse seven let's move forward a little bit how be it I believe not the words until I came and my eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me you will do more abundantly and Beyond what you could think or imagine amen thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard amen amen happy are thy men amen happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom blessed be the Lord thy God oh my that's good which delighteth indeed to set thee on the throne of Israel because the Lord loved Israel forever therefore made he the king to do judgment and justice and she gave the king 120 talents of gold and of spices great very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon it's like that woman that came to Jesus feet and poured out her spices poured out her her oil from her little alabaster box that meant more than all the riches that was in that house then the names that were in that room that day she has done more amen this little bride my brother and sister don't underestimate your life your lives your sacrifices that you make the moves that you make and and the countries that you move from and to just sit under the word of God and you know I look across this room it's a very Multicultural room here tonight but we've come from the outermost parts of the world to want to pour out our lives pour out our sacrifices our spices before the Lord and I believe that God will be able to say there was never such a Time amen because we we you know the Angels cannot sing like us you know that tonight the Angels cannot worship like we can worship oh my all right let's try and move forward here a little bit more verse 11 says and the Navy the Navy also of Hiram that bought brought gold from over brought in from o for a great plenty of all mug trees and precious stones and the King made of the Omak trees pillars for the house of the Lord and for the King's house Harps also and sulturies for singers there came no such almond trees nor were seen unto this day everything turned into the foundations of the House of the pillars and you know their lives in other words my brother and sister the things you bring to the house of God become memorials they become pillars they become testimonies like you gave tonight amen and when we are raised up in that day my brother and sister God will say there was never such a time as that time when I ruled with My Little Queen on the earth the queen of the guarantee oh I feel good tonight oh that's verse here verse 13. and King Solomon gave unto the Queen of Sheba all her desire all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which Solomon gave her of his Royal Bounty so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants you think of what he's saying here besides uh his Royal bounty so besides what he was already planning to give her you know she came with just a little extra Lord but remember also my family right she just had a few extra requests you know on top of what the royalty would normally give just her position she had blessings because of her position you know but my brother's sister because she found favor with him it was just a little something extra because she's the queen of the guarantee huh he gave her Beyond he gave her all all that she desired what did Jesus Christ tell us whatsoever you asking my name whatsoever you ask in my name whatsoever you desire huh the queen of the oath my I was so encouraged when I see that this is the end of an era my what a testimony We Carry in our hearts the queen of the oath I can just see on on Judgment Day when when when she's summonsed in huh bring in the queen of the guarantee you know when there's there might be people there that day that

bring in the the guarantee of God's work on Earth amen I'm finished I've got so much we could say here Prophet goes on but he talks about how great this Solomon was and how that there's a greater than Solomon here right now right at this very moment and you are the queen of the oath yes you are that Queen tonight you're sitting under a guarantee and all she did was was move closer to Solomon she came to where he was amen she humbled herself brought her her sacrifice of love and and and and praise he said Lord I want to know I want to know all the the I have questions on my heart tonight or Lord I need to know something about my family member or or this thing that I'm dealing with at work or whatever it may be but you know my grand sister because of who she was he opened up everything that was in her heart he told her all the secrets he gave her everything she asked for how much more can he do for you tonight if a greater than Solomon is here tonight of a greater oath of a stronger more enforceable oath this is the priesthood we are under amen right and we also are royalty in that sense he's made us Kings and Priests yes right amen amen hurry and Jesus is standing here the prophet says there's nothing hid tonight from him he sees your heart he sees everything and he's the guarantee of his promise to you how many we could go through so many stories tonight of how God gave a promise and then came and fulfilled that promise whether they were Barren whether they were sick whether they were unsafe my brother and sister God is the guarantee if you have a promise tonight you might say well brother Chris I'm holding for a family member tonight we have a promise and we have a guarantee to that promise tonight if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ die and I
