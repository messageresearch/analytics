we've got um sister vicky has an item fanny you can come up too okay he was joking when he said weeks and weeks we only decided about five minutes before the service to do this um and so what our sunday school class has been talking about is about respect and last week we did two stories and we were talking about how um how you get different results from different um if you make different choices and um so this i'll tell you the second story first we went over two different stories and the second one was of um the widow the widow woman and elijah elijah and elisha the the one was about um elijah and yeah so one was about the widow women and how she gave her everything she had to elijah and because of that she her the barrel never ran dr um the flower and the oil never disappeared until they had rain because she chose to respect the man of god and his service and the other one we did first is what we're gonna play out um this is elisha baldhead turpin um and you will notice also there's one difference there's three she-bears i mean three bears but that's because bears like i mean they like to be bears um so i'm just gonna read the story for you and we're gonna act it out um elisha you go over there okay and he went up from thence talking about elisha unto bethel and as he came forth little children out of the city mocked him and said unto him go up that bald head go up that bald head and it was a lot more intense than that it wasn't just standing there and looking and he turned back and looked on him on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two in this case three but that's just because of three bears and growl and um out of the woods and tear up 40 and two children of them and he went went from thence unto mount carmel and from thence and he turned to samaria and it was a lot louder than that in the sunday school class but i'm apparently they decided to be a bit quieter now um um yeah so we were just talking about the results of whether you choose to respect an office and in in other words god's choice yeah that's it thank really spoke to us so i hope they speak to you too [Music] me [Music] [Music] um um okay it's

god bless you great to have you amen let's go to the scripture shall we um amen praise the lord let's go to we're going to first kings 22. you could turn me down a little bit that'd be that'd be good i'm gonna read from verse a four of a lengthy reading trust you don't mind down to verse so from verse 4 down to verse 24 amen and he said unto jehoshaphat this is this is the um this is the king of israel and king of samaria coming together to go to war he says will thou go with me to battle to rammoth gilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people is thy people my horses as thy horses and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men and they said unto them shall i go against ramoth gilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king hold on sorry and jehoshaphat said is there not uh is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might inquire of him and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man mikaya the son of imla by whom we may inquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil see everyone likes to hear good things about themselves don't they and um and and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so then the king of israel called an off um an officer and said hasten um hasten hitherto to mikaya the son of imla and the king of israel in jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place by the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them and zedekiah the son of uh chenana um made him horns of iron and said thus saith the lord with thee shall thou push the assyrians till thou have consumed them and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramoth gilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the king's hand and the messenger that was gone to call mikaya spake unto him remember this is an officer so the king's trying to put a influence upon him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah shall we go against rammoth gilead to battle or shall we forbid and he answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord but he just said what the others said and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills the sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house and peace and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil he said uh hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramoth gilead and one said on this manner and the other side on that manner and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all the all of his prophets oh sorry all of his prophets and he said thou shall persuade him and prevail also and go forth and do so now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerningly but zedekiah the son of uh chennai went forth and smote mikaya on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer who if anyone has a need you want us just just raise your hands before the lord this day lord jesus we are so thankful lord we can truly sing lord with understanding and thanksgiving in our hearts that the word is open sin is broken no more darkness no more shame lord that we can come and we can sing lord about how we one day we took our lives our alabaster box who broke it at your feet we pulled out our entire lives lord lord with your love and our hearts lord we worship you dear god we thank you for this day thank you for this morning we can gather and lord lord in this place and i just pray father you just take your words lord take your word lord we know one word from you can change our eternal destination it does oh god so lord i'm just asking may you come and speak this morning lord i just want to get myself out of the way that you can come and have preeminence lord jesus in this service lord may you just take every heart and lift us up into heavenly places in christ jesus and may we walk out of this place changed and renewed and strengthened in you lord please may you grant it dear god we commit our lives into your hands and the service be with those who couldn't make it today where they're sick and body or they couldn't travel lord i pray you'd be their portion lord may you grant it father in jesus christ and we ask these things and you see every hand that's been raised every burden that we carry father may you answer those o lord because your word is still a discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart father so may you just be glorified in the service lord we ask these things in your wonderful name and name the lord jesus christ amen and then god bless your friends you may have your seats and just if you want to turn i just don't want to keep you standing too long so we're going to go also to to the book of matthew and chapter 7 and jesus is speaking here he says this therefore whosoever heareth thee sayings of mine and doth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and i want to speak this may seem like an odd kind of text but i want to speak about conditioning how about being being prepared for things we you know we read here about you know we've read about you know your makai and those prophets and and and and we'll come back to those things but you know you go through the scripture and everything has been conditioned by something and even our lives have been conditioned a certain way and i believe it was the cambridge dictionary now i'll probably get going a bit faster a while but let's just lay you know let's just plow for a little bit you know conditioning i believe is from the cambridge dictionary it's the process of training or accustoming a person or or animal to behave in a certain way to accept certain conditions and there's different like psychological conditioning there's different forms of conditioning but this is just the first definition that came up so so be conditioned to something influences your life and changes your behavior based on on that thing now i'm sure we can all agree with all we are all conditioned by a certain way even even our first birth conditions us a certain way you know the traits that we inherit from our father and our mother you know they are inbred into your bread and to us and you know brother brown would speak in the message of paradox and i don't have the quote up here but he would speak about how a how a young man was engaged to a girl or i think just going with that girl and and and he did something to her that that that totally upset her and now the parents were alarmed that he did it and now the parents have gone to brother brown and they're asking asking him why why why'd this happen because they're trying to tap into that gift into his life that the law can come down and reveal it and um and so his parents are both believers and even the son appears to be a believer he's given us he's come to the altar he's been baptized you know he fellowships among the believers but but the parents are wanting to understand why has this happened and and and brother brown you know knew them and he and he knew their extended family and they were the only two that were were believers and so he would he would say about say the mother's family now i'll probably get this mixed up as i normally get things vice versa but but they were part irish and they were they were part german i think the mother was german and then then the mother was irish raised in in america and so brother brown described you know the irish side moody high strung high tempered and that came into the boy and then the german side indifferent to religion you know kind of you know not very engaging anyway that and and that came into the boy but then brother bam said about the parents you're not like that because you've been born again so so his first birth so their first birth conditioned them a certain way so when i'm talking about conditioning i'm not saying well you know we have all been conditioned by something you know so so they were conditioned a certain way by by just the genes the the nature the spirit that came down you know you know their first birth condition them a certain way they said you're not like that anymore because you've actually met the lord and but then even the father was so confused by this big because he said you know because brother brahm said i would advise this young man never marry this girl never marry anyone because he'll make it hell on earth for her and then the father said but my son has been baptized he's come to the altar given his heart to the lord i know my son has come to christ and brother i said no he's done all the outward things but until that new nature comes into him he says i advise that boy never to marry so it can appear so close right but what's really conditioning us now this house that we read about here i've got everyone's attention hey praise the lord you know this house we read about the wise house is conditioned it was prepared for storms it was prepared we know in our life there's always going to be storms we cannot insulate our entire life from any spirit of the devil any any hardship any misunderstandings any pain we can't live in a complete bubble otherwise we'd be up in glory because that's the only way we can be truly you know so and and this won't be today but but maybe the next service i want to go into you know i you know i read on facebook someone just put on there what not even a believer just talking about psychology or something he said parents many parents you know there's there's two options raising children and and and this is for adults too you're either prepared for the road so so you're prepared for you are prepared for life's journey or you try and prepare the road for the child so so what does that mean so so to prepare the road for the child what do you do you put up road blocks you put up cones you get law enforcement no car's going to cross that road because the child's walking but that's not how life can be right you've got to prepare the child that they can cross the road amen so that's the conditioning so but but that's that's maybe next next time but i just want you to think about it because we're all conditioned if there's influences in our lives that condition us just to to to think a certain way to look at things a certain way even our thought pattern is based on a conditioning but we want to be conditioned uh by the word of the lord amen so so this house i'm sure you can agree the the wise man conditioned the house he knew storms would come he knew there'd be winds he knew there'd be rain he knew there'd be trouble but he conditioned the house remember it can be the same kind of house on the outside but one the man had the foresight or the vision to dig down through the sand dig down through maybe the sander looked better up on the sand but he wanted to make sure the house was conditioned to stand when trouble came i mean so so that's always the thing you know we can't just we this is not a picnic life is not a picnic remember even you know even the same trials that happen to a people in the world that happen to us we're not exempt from anything we're not exempt from any spirit any trouble we don't get to get out of jail free card right we we we still have to endure and be tested and be tried but if where our lives are conditioned the right way amen the the wind will come the rain will come the storms will come the trouble will come the misunderstandings will come amen the hurt will come the wounds will come the complexes will come but yet we will stand i mean so i i i believe i'm looking at wise people i mean that that that that consider things of the future consider current scenarios of life and they and they don't just plow through blindly but they're looking looking ahead lord what's the best way amen you know i'm glad you know the bible says and james if any man lacks wisdom let him ask god he'll give it abundantly i'm glad about that verse hallelujah amen and so but the foolish man did not prepare his house his house wasn't conditioned for the trouble amen now these prophets here they were sincere people they weren't indifferent they were sincere they weren't heathens they were hebrew prophets they were believers they were believers but they were conditioned by the wrong thing actually let's just stop let's just go through the body soul and spirit and soul in the world people are conditioned athletes have to be conditioned to compete right they don't just no one in the world that i know of right just rolls out of bed says i'm going to be in all black and then the next minute they're in all black you know like monday morning i'm going to be in all black saturday he's on the field it doesn't work that way someone has to be conditioned to be on the field right and and that's just not in the sporting arena that's in any arena you know it could be business whatever it may be people actually have to be conditioned they have to be prepared they have to be you know come into a routine of life in order to to actually achieve what they want to achieve i mean and and i'm sure you can agree with me just even not just because i just said it but you know everyone everyone who actually uh obtains anything in life they're conditioned a certain way right even you take elon musk or um the guy who owns amazon or whoever they've conditioned themselves they see a goal whatever it is can be selfish not selfish whatever they want to do do it and they condition their lives in order to obtain that right they didn't just roll out of bed so i'm going to invent amazon i'm going to rule the world by over the internet and there they are no no it takes conditioning amen and then so so anyone who even just a functioning member of society that has a job or has a family or you know both or you know have a career or whatever they condition themselves i mean to to fulfill that right they have a routine amen now a lot of you are looking at me like you're just being captain obvious today well maybe i am but you know we're conditioned by something you know people don't just roll out of bed and now they're the ceo of a company or they're a multi-billionaire they're conditioned right so so that's just in the natural people you know professional athletes they spend their whole life right conditioning themselves mental toughness not just physical toughness mental toughness right and in order to compete we need routine we need a routine we need discipline right because you know the biggest problem brother braham says that even in this day there's actually the curse no well i don't know if he said the word curse but there's a there's a problem with soft living it's actually a bad thing now i don't want to go live in the third world don't get me wrong but but there's actually there's always pros and cons for all things right so so there's actually a con of actually having it too good because if you have it too good then then you don't have any drive to do anything why do i need to do anything i get i get money from the government i can just live off the pigs back you know i can you know i can get everything i need live a certain way man is not built just to do that man is built to have a goal have an aspiration in life and then i'm not just talking about christians i'm talking about anyone so so this society has conditioned us a certain way right different countries condition their people a certain way this country's conditioned us a certain way amen so these prophets so so that's just now that's just now in the in the natural anyone who wants to do anything they become conditioned right they have a drive in their life they want to obtain something and then their whole life is focused around that right amen remember the era of professionals i mean i mean amateur sport is well and truly gone well and truly gone even even i think in our my generation oh boy i can't believe i said that but you know that was when professional like rugby had gone out the door i mean had had had come in there was amateurs but now it came fully professional is in my lifetime so you know if that's the way naturally then what about spiritually amen we're not we're not sunday morning christians we're not wednesday night christians we're 24 7 christians hallelujah amen we're being conditioned by a word hallelujah i mean so now that's just in the natural now now now if we go into the spiritual we read about these um well well we read about these prophets here and so i don't have a blank for this thing but oh well oh no wait we can just go back to that one now these these prophets they the king had 400 trained hebrew prophets and they were in the office of a prophet i do not believe they were not sincere they were sincere men but you see the the influence of the king conditioned them very differently to micaiah right they were conditioned brother brown would say if if i think i have it here just uh he said this isn't perseverant and so they went up and got 400 well-fed trained prophets so now here were these 400 prophets and they begin to lean because the king you say they were good they were well fed you know but but they were they but their conditioning came from a natural man their conditioning came from a church system right they were leaning oh who are you i'm one of the king's prophets that came with benefits you know like jobs they get you know certain benefits come with a job you know some get house car whatever made you know all those things you know free travel these guys got perks but the problem is their conditioning came from the wrong source so now what happens is these ones could be influenced by a natural man a man by ahab who wasn't a godly king right he wasn't like david or hezekiah he was a he was not a godly king he was one of the most evil kings that had ever come into the land and now these ones were under his influence so now whatever he wanted basically they would get religious about it amen and they could be swayed by his influence whatever way he wanted remember he wanted to go and fight he wanted to go take ramos gilead that was already his motive he wasn't neutral when he asked him can you seek the lord and see what we should do should we go or not no he already made up his mind that's why he got the other king with him right they made up their mind so now these ones under that influence because they were conditioned by a natural man's thinking right they begin to just prophesy and get excited and things and what they said naturally lined up with what he said even though they were fundamental they were sincere they were hebrew prophets they weren't unbelievers but yet because they were just conditioned in their spirit realm i mean they were they would only say what the king wanted them to say and and how subtle that would be you say but you know how shocked they would have been when when when makaya came up and you know mackay he wasn't conditioned according to how the other prophets were is everyone following me maybe maybe we're just going to go a bit slow today but but we're going to get up the hill maybe we're in the passing lane and other ones are going past us but but we're going to get up okay but i want this to sink in because i said because the question should be lord what is conditioning my life it can appear to be so close remember ramoth gilead was israel's possession right it was part of their inheritance it was god-given place but they had lost it and it wasn't the season to re to to to go get it back it means they were trying to work in the word at the wrong season right but the but the motive of it was not a pure motive it was actually the king wanted it so they're going to come under the vision of an earthly king and then so but but the king of um israel i don't know no the king of samaria he was he was you know yo jehoshaphat the king of israel so i know king of samaria he he had a bitter god about him imagine that 400 prophets 400 ministers they had a minister's meeting they gathered all these ministers and they begin to maybe sing and you know you know one mind but we're one mind one heart one accord the move is on brother we're gonna take this place oh my it would have been exciting they're up on their thrones the kings were outside the gate and you know it was all the pomp and the ceremony and it was an international well it's a national convention here comes the minister who's going to preach first who's going to have the inspiration first they are excited and you know but it was under the wrong inspiration because they were conditioned by a king not by the word and so it would have been quite a thing but then but then jehoshaphat had a little bit of god about him and and he asked the king of israel do you have one more that sounds kind of ridiculous doesn't it what do you mean i got 400 they're well fed look at them they're conditioned they're conditioned you know you know they're well fed look how well robed they are and you know all these things they know the scripture just right they can quote it just right they can quote the message of moses just right amen but he says there's got to be one more surely and then and then the king you know said to him yeah there's one but i hate this guy i don't let the king say so why he always prophesies against me oh let's just go get him interesting isn't it there's always the you know there's always the one just to rock the boat a little bit but it's the boat rocking one that's normally the godly one i mean so so here was now someone that wasn't under the influence of the king and god i mean and and the king sent an officer to him a man of influence to go speak to him and you know as they're coming back you know he he would say to him you know you know brother mackay you've been out of fellowship so long you know you've been by yourself and you know just say what they say this is how the meeting's been going oh boy brother so-and-so got up and preached about we're going to take the fullness of the land and you know we got excited and they begin to prophesy and you know the header head of the ministerials you know association made some horns and he said by these you'll push them out of the land and oh boy the anointing was incredible you should say what they say we're excited the move is on brother the move is on but but he wasn't conditioned by a system he wasn't conditioned by his society he wasn't conditioned by what the king would say he said i'm only going to say what god says because he had a different kind of conditioning and now this is where it comes down you say brother talks about the thin edge of the wedge between the make and the truth and and and he he just said i'm going to say only what god would say so he wasn't influenced by by by the men he was only influenced by the word and so here he was he comes up and then and then the king says to him what's your message from god what word do you have what are you going to preach on go up and take it and there's something obviously in his voice where the king says this guy's just sarcastic he always says evil against me he just said what the others said and then he began to open up his vision remember he wasn't looking at the king he wasn't looking at what the other brothers were saying he was looking what the word had said and because he had a vindicated prophet before him elijah prophesied that the dogs were going to lick ahab's blood amen so he knew so so elijah had gone off the scene all they had was the message of elijah amen all they had was the message of elijah and so he knew it had to be fulfilled this man had to die amen amen so so he knew this is what's going to happen and then you know he believed now here we were the stage is set the bases are loaded it's all ready hallelujah and so so so he said no i saw israel scattered was like sheep without it out of shepherd and this this offended the other prophets and then it offended him moore said okay i'll tell you what i saw brothers i was praying and the spirit of god came down and he lifted me up into heavenly places and i saw the throne room and then god was having a conference up in heaven because remember if something's happening on earth something's happening in heaven too right even now something's going on in heaven because there's a conference on earth hallelujah and he said he said god said to everyone there how can we make ahab fulfill what elijah prophesied how we're going to make this word fulfilled and one spirit you know one said this other said this this one said this then a lying spirit from hell came up and said i'll get them to fulfill i'll get them to go and i'll get him to end up in that battle and then the and then the head head prophet was so offended by this he went any and he slapped him in the mouth see when did the spirit of god you know come out of me and all these things you know he said no no you're anointed by a lying spirit and the reason he could say that because it wasn't with the word for the day right it was contrary the word said this man had to die in battle are you following me so you've got to look at your conditioning we can be caught up in so many things but what are we conditioned by amen because those prophets were sincere they were sincere men and they felt an anointing i felt inspired i believe his um um what's his name was you know the head prophet he would have felt inspired picking up those horns and running around he wasn't putting on a show he was actually being a sign remember prophets can be signs right so so he was he was a sincere man and so he got offended at at makai zedekiah did yeah you know and then he and he slapped him in the mouth but micaiah said no this is what i saw in heaven and we're in the fulfillment of that and then ahab said after this yo take him into in a prison and feed him the bread of sorrow and water of sorrow and you know and then mackay said if you return it all god didn't speak to me this man was influenced conditioned by the lord himself amen and this is how we have to be in this day we have to be conditioned by the word not by human influence not by emotional entanglement amen not by oh everyone else is doing it but we're going to be conditioned by the word of god hallelujah and that is the only thing that will stand in this day amen this this day of supercharged emotionalism and you know different things we can't be caught up in something that is not according to the scripture you know sadly if it's been prophesied that america is going to be smoke bombs and craters it's going to be smoke bombs and craters right if it says that the catholic church will rule the world it's going to happen amen if it says them yo it's going to be chaos you know pre-tribulation times are here it's going to be here unfortunately so we have to walk according to the promise of the day what is the promise of the day a rapture amen this is what we're to be conditioned to that promise amen that we walk with god we walk in his word hallelujah and then he'll take us because we're not because god took us hallelujah so we need to be conditioned we know we know that there's more demon power upon this earth than any other day we know that we see it on the streets so we've got to be conditioned to withstand it i mean there should be something you know i love i love real christianity because of the personal relationship with jesus christ amen and whenever a spirit comes against you there should be something in you saying that is not of me i mean there should be something in you saying that is wrong it doesn't matter how dressed up it is what it appears to be there should be something in you saying i will not fall for that i mean because i've been conditioned by the holy ghost i'm not just conditioned in my spirit or in my body i'm conditioning my soul that's how it needs to be amen when a spirit because remember there's so many spirits in this day trying to pull us and drag us and get us caught up in all different kinds of things but we're going to be conditioned when the enemy comes in like a flood there's got to be a standard raised up hallelujah amen because the storms will come the rain will come spirits will come i mean pain will come misunderstandings will come hallelujah be being between two opinions will come all those things will come but if we're conditioned amen by the holy ghost himself we will be able to stand amen hallelujah amen they were well well-fed prophets now the apostle paul would say this in in romans 12 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so do not be conditioned by the world don't be conditioned by this world but be conditioned by the holy ghost which transforms you amen that's that is that is what we need to do hallelujah amen so so we shouldn't be conditioned by what society is telling us amen we shouldn't be caught up in what society is telling us we need to be conditioned by the word of god i mean that we can walk you know you take the apostle paul incredible man there was there was antichrist spirits floating around in that day the galatians were pulled this way corinthians were caught up in this you know the ephesians they forgot to love their families and you know different things were going on there was fear and worry in the thessalonica church and you know but he could walk among all of that and call people back to the word of god amen he was conditioned he met the lord on the road to damascus he got conditioned hallelujah and then he could walk in that world that great change you know time of change going on christianity was just coming into the world the gentiles were coming in there was a lot of questions there's a lot of trouble antichrist spirits trying to come in and drag people back into the law and different things going on but he could walk among that whole mess and call the bride now if that was in the beginning it's got to be at the end there's got to be a people upon the earth that don't be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine every deed of nicolaitanism you know all these things going on and we can walk between it all and yet be a shining light to everyone but come under the influence of none of it i believe i'm looking at those kind of people this message has come amen that we can be these kind of people hallelujah amen so to be transformed by the renewing of your mind now conditioning can happen suddenly i mean slowly slowly slowly or it can happen very quickly i believe those 400 profits it was a process they slowly came under the influence of the king until they are completely reliant on the king but it can happen very quickly adam was a god over the earth god told adam and eve have dominion subdue it yes this is your domain adam's last act as a god man was trying to redeem his wife he wasn't deceived in the transgression the scripture tells us eve was he he went with his eyes open he knew what he had to do with his life last act as a as as as um as a god man i'll put it that way was to try and redeem his wife but as soon as sin came in as soon as he fell from his position he was conditioned by sin and then now when god calls the calls calls adam and eve and the serpent to a conference and he begins to ask who calls all this stuff then adam it says the man said the woman whom now gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat so automatically sin has conditioned him to blame someone else right he's actually telling god god you are the result you are the cause of this problem because you gave me this woman it's not me i didn't do it i'm innocent i'm just an innocent bystander i'm just caught up i'm a victim of circumstance but he chose to do it because because it was christ and adam trying to redeem his fallen bride but as soon as sin came in he blames everyone else i'm a victim of circumstance my parents are this way so i'm this way and my school's this way so i'm this way and this people this way my church is this way so i'm this way hold on hold on if we're conditioned by the word we can be like mikaya and we can walk into a convention harley and not be caught up in the anointing that's there if it's not of god and we can discern and withstand the antichrist spirit just like mackay did because he saw the inspiration that was coming forth out of those men was wrong because it was contrary to the word of the hour hallelujah but you see when when when sin has conditioned us a certain way man will never take responsibility for his own actions you know my parents always told me take responsibility for what you do that's what we have to do you can't blame someone else it's like if i get in the car and i run someone over i can't blame that person i was driving the car and just say if i was drunk driving god forbid i never would but you know well the lord take the desire out of me so you know but i've told you that probably many times but you know if i get drunk and i'm driving behind a car and i hit someone i can't say that guy shouldn't have been on the road i have to take responsibility i caused that man's death right and it's the same thing even with anything i'm just a poor little victim hold on what are you doing with what happened because with sin people try and bypass the new birth by actually saying no i'm not a sinner they don't take responsibility for living with this fallen nature that you're born with remember we have the ability this morning you can take that for the nature you're born with and get rid of the thing and be birthed into the kingdom amen but if you say well i'm just a good little person no hold on we're all born lost right but there's someone here who can find us you just got to put your little hand up say lord jesus here i am hallelujah so sin conditioned adam real quick and he blamed god this is god's fault you know he's the reason for this but god knew it would happen but god didn't cause it to happen he allowed it to happen two different things so we can't go get mad at god for things amen we should never ever get mad this is god's fault hold on hold on before you were born he made a way before you were ever born he made a way for you to overcome in this trial hallelujah why the lamb was slammed before the foundational world so before there was a devil before the one who actually caused the whole thing happen god made a way for you to overcome him in this day hallelujah amen conditioning can be also because of make believers pharaoh's heart was hardened because after aaron threw down the rod of moses his magicians did the same thing oh you've got supernatural in your church mike can do it too but the motive behind the two are different one was i want the people to stay in slavery so never overcome sin never overcome unbelief but just stay in egypt oh we're gonna be all things to all men hold on hold on you got to be careful how you take that does that mean i just you know drink it up with the boys oh but i'm bringing all things to all men now hold on they're going to see something different and it's not us looking down our noses at people that's not the different but they should be able to see a life that's different why are you happy why do you have peace why do you have contentment why what's going on oh is it because of a bottle though is it because of something i shoot in my veins no something i smoke no some some some tv netflix or something no none of that stuff it's because of him and if there's anything in them that wants it they'll begin to get thirsty hallelujah but you see pharaoh's heart was hardened because his sorcerers did the same thing amen so the conditioning the conditioning of pharaoh's heart was because of make believers in his in his camp if they were amen but moses moses um what do you call it objective was to get the people into the promised land right but the other others just wanted to keep them in egypt but his heart was hardened by that you know the devil will never point us to the genuine he never puts a real believer on a pedestal says look this is what the blood does never ever ever no what's what's always in the paper some scandal some pedophilia thing some horrible terrible thing that should never have happened you know in some church or something some pastor does something the catholic church does this or whatever you know all this historical horrible stuff what does it do it hardens the heart of the people because they what they do is they take that and they just say all christians are like that amen but it's never it's never ever in the paper someone from a wrecked up life meets the lord jesus christ and now they have peace now they have joy now they're content in their life now they're happy i've never read that i never go on stuff and that's the front page news no it's about glory avail or something that you know something and people just say oh that's just that that's just all this stuff's about it isn't yeah that's right that is just a a fake something for the devil to throw out there saying this is how it is and it and unfortunately it's come it is within the message itself too amen why because people have been like the 400 prophets their spirit is conditioned by the word and they try and live a holy life amen that's why people it's amazing you see things come and go and and it probably still is quite prevalent but you know the lord told brother brown that that that evidence of the new birth is you can receive the word for your day but what life is being produced the fruit of the spirit is still there that verse did not become null and void because the lord showed him that right so there's got to be a life amen there's got to be a life living not us trying to manufacture something it just lives something just pulsates out of us hell of joy comes out peace love long suffering goodness faith gentleness meekness hallelujah all those things just come out of the life why because you've really met the lord but people who could never actually surrender their lives completely said oh no it's just receiving the word for the day hold on it is but if that's not then what is the manifestation of that christian life fruit of the spirit amen so unfortunately it's even of course within the message because we're not exempt we're still people not everyone actually has the new birth right i'm glad i didn't hear hallelujah to that one now taking sides with jesus see there's many times that a minister will make a mistake and if he comes into a neighborhood a precious brother who's trying to do what's right and lead the people to right everything that the devil can point to the unbeliever or the so-called christian in that neighborhood to throw off on that man he'll do it conditioning conditioning why is there not why is there not a genuine revival even you take after yeah yeah you know 9 11 in the states churches were full then they were emptied again why because the problem is as christianity's come to a place where it's just join a church just like brother ram says put your name on a book join a church be a good church member that's not christianity that's joining a club right you can join shekinah tabernacle club there's no membership forms but you can join it in your mind i'm a believer i come here my family comes here my friends come here they're nice people that's just joining a club don't ever join a club meet the lord jesus yourself let him change you and then you've joined the right club and you don't join it you're born into it it's just like little william there i didn't ask him do you want to be brought into my family no he's born into it images like brother ram says you know i've been at brandon however many years no one asked me to join the family i was born into it it's the same thing with the family of god we don't join it we're birthed amen into the family of god amen hallelujah but there's a different kind of conditioning just like mackay we we spoke about and that's when the holy ghost grips a soul that's where i kind of want to plow on through but now because i beat on the other side now let's come to what really what we want to be or what we already are many of us amen behold the woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil now this woman had a need but she wasn't just conditioned in her body or in her spirit she is conditioned in her soul because if your soul is conditioned real faith is in there nothing can stop that faith from reaching its destination no discouragement amen no trouble no no trying to be put off faith will pierce all through that and we'll get what it needs amen so so here was this woman cries out oh lord thou son of david my fa my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us so she comes to the master think about this she comes to the living word himself and says i have this need she knew he could do it yes does he come back straight away and say what is your need ignores her flat now he's actually proving her faith god is going to prove your conditioning storms will come storms will go water will beat against the house but if you built it wisely it's upon the rock of revelation of who jesus christ is amen so it'll stand amen hallelujah now answered not a word but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel i'm not even saying to you now how many people would that throw off then came sheen worshipped him saying lord help me yes but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs he just called the woman a dog how many people would that throw off but you see her conditioning wasn't in her emotional realm it was actually a faith revelation right it wasn't a human faith it was actually she knew if she just got to him it's going to be fine it wasn't i hope this works let's see how this happens no no no she knew it was already revealed get to the master let him speak the word and it's done that's a real conditioning in the soul amen and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman greatest thy faith amen beard unto thee even as thou will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour why because her soul was conditioned there's no deviation it's just faith faith knew i must get to the master didn't matter what he said i mean you're a dog it's not meat you've not come to i've not even come to minister unto you oh lord help me even the dogs get the crumbs that fall down i'll take anything i can i mean and she and she got what she needed by just by getting some crumbs i mean if a little bit of crumbs can fall we can just get some crumbs how much for a whole loaf of the word harlow how much for a whole loaf amen amen but her faith was perseverant because she wasn't conditioned in her spirit realm in her mind in her body it was in her soul it was revealed to her i just got to get to him hallelujah amen micaiah was condition in his soul elijah the same way the apostles were the same way all the believers down through the ages were conditioned by the word of god and the word of god alone amen we've got to be the same kind of way i mean we can't be rejoicing because everything's just going fine remember faith is not a mental frame of mind it's not a mental frame of mind oh i believe because i can think clearly about it no faith is a revelation faith has revealed you it's going to happen hallelujah so we can't just be caught up in our conditioning our mind saying well if i keep all the thoughts away and i keep all the trouble away and i just focus mentally on the word it's good to do that but it's got to go beyond that into your heart is everyone with me amen we want to be conditioned highly by the word of god amen now to be transformed is to be changed and to make something different it's like a tadpole is transformed from a tadpole to a frog see once he looked like a catfish he swims around he's got a head and his tail and everything looks just like a catfish then after a while he begins to to lose he loses the tail and he's transformed from one specie to another and i think that's um and i think that's what the apostle paul must have had in mind when he said be transformed by the renewing let's see let me get that right be not conformed you know what conformed is i'll say be not be not conditioned by this world to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind renewing of your mind the things that you once thought upon to be precious lay that aside and be transformed to something else what you was one time to what you are now see by the renewing of your mind that you might prove that good and acceptable and perfect will of god that's from the power of transformation are you with me this is what we need to be conditioned by the right thing not be conditioned by a group not be conditioned by you know just by a church remember we don't have a relationship to the lord through the church we have relay we have a relationship to the lord through his word because he has his word amen we're going to be conditioned we're going to condition our children the right way where to condition ourselves even even how we think we can you know it's not just children that are going to be conditioned the right way us adults we can condition our minds to think lazy right we can condition our minds not to feel anything not to be emotionally attached we can condition ourselves if we let things affect us the wrong way we can condition our thinking that it's always negative you're with me amen but in the same time that's the negative side but on the positive side we can actually condition our minds to be positive amen that we are actually taught all things are possible to them that believe how there is nothing impossible with you whatever ye say when you believe speak unto your mountain it shall be cast into the sea and if you believe it shall be done i mean this is what this word has come to do make a people that are conditioned by the by the word of god itself that doesn't matter what's going on in the world they can stand true hallelujah amen when you know you know when when brother bram saw the preview of the bride and i'll just i'll just close with this he saw them robed in in the lord's righteousness this is the bride in the beginning and the end and the marching in step onward christian soldier marching as to war they're all walking in line they're being conditioned by a voice and they are following that voice but then some of them which are in european garb which is interesting but won't go into that they were beginning to look at where the other church was going and they were actually getting out of step because they were looking at two different things at the same time so that would be conditioned by what the others were doing yeah and then brother ram is standing screaming stay in line stay in line he found himself come to something stay in line why because he saw he saw the value of staying in line hallelujah and that's why we've got to say we've received a voice in this day this message you say well it was preached 50 years ago it applies now what he said then is more current now than it was then way more current you want to read today's newspaper amen go listen to the message and it will show you what's going on in the world it's going on right now amen because what it does is you say that's just the veneer what do you see in the newspaper but what's the spirit behind it that's what i want to know because you if you see the spirit behind it then you can actually say well that's god that's not of god that's god that's not of god i mean but if you just look at the veneer you can be swayed by things and there's so many voices in this day i want to stay in line and then you go to the message and say oh so that's the veneer in the news but this is the spirit behind it hallelujah and that's everything we're in an election year it's a lolly scramble right now if we if you elect us you know for some reason i found myself in the student council intermediate school it's the same thing we want to do this let's have a skate day let's do this you know we'll do this and promises and you know anyway but we're going to stay we've received a vindicated word in this hour right and it's conditioning us it doesn't matter what happens around we can just keep walking what are you doing brother ben i'm walking i feel like traveling on i feel like traveling on hallelujah amen what have you been conditioned by by the lord himself hallelujah we're looking for mackays in this day remember in mackay's day the prophet had gone off the scene it was now that bride group standing there he was that bride group right and i believe i'm looking at those kind of people aren't you glad you can just look into the word of god and you can identify this is what's going on in this hour but it's not just those things going on in this hour there's a rapture what's happening in the church at the moment there's a swarming so brother talks about the ducks you know they begin to swarm before they migrate you know the spirit begins to move a bit more though once maybe indifferent on their nest but now they're on the pond and they're quacking around and you know they're getting excited why because the season's changing the season it's getting a bit warmer you know the coldness of the church is going out around the world there's a warmth coming in the sunlight you feel the sunlight on your on your face now of the s-o-n that that that you never felt before in the wintertime because now it's springtime hallelujah you know so now now there's a now there's a change going on and there's a swarming going on hallelujah yes i i don't believe i'm just talking pie in the sky i believe it's really happening hallelujah and so but what's the swarming for we're going to take a flight we're going to take a flight you know the most conditioned uh the most conditioned vehicle in the world is a spaceship the most conditioned is a spaceship they it has to be perfect they can just have a minute floor in the thing and once it gets to a certain height it just goes boof and it can be just a simple thing is not right it just explodes now do you know we live in an astronaut age we are the spiritual astronauts of this of this age we live in we don't live in an airplane age we live in an astronaut age so what's all the conditioning going on to get ready for our flight amen what does the astronaut do he actually just sits there but he's had pre-flight training right he knows where he's going he knows the mission plan right he you know he's you know he's got into a lot of schooling or she's got through a lot of schooling and she's ready and then all the technicians are looking at the gauges and the weather and the atmosphere and you know is the atmosphere just right can he fly just now you know if it's not they don't fly they delay and you know so the atmosphere's got to be right and they check all the gauges of all the fuel and everything's got to be just right and that's why we come to church i heard brother donnie reagan said this or i like it he says you know i love love gage is it on full is the malicion empty is the unbelief on empty as the faith on full is the tank full as the love on full the long suffering on full as the malice gone how are we are we dressed up in our space suit amen the baptism of the holy ghost are we ready amen is the vessel ready is the gospel ship ready yes it's ready and those things are monitored monitored everything's fine and then eventually it's going to be the end of the countdown you know what we're waiting for ignition brother and preached the countdown went from seven to zero from the ephesian age down to the later cnn age and what's after zero ignition and where are we ignition the law has just got to go [Music] hallelujah why because the tanks are ready the holy ghost oils in the tank hallelujah amender amen the spacemen are ready hey we're ready for our liftoff to go hey man and we're not going to the moon we're going to glory hallelujah but are you conditioned in your soul to go and i just want to i want to leave it there i can't tell you if you're conditioned i can't tell you if you're not conditioned it's an individual walk you say but i'm just a young person no you can still be conditioned to walk remember we and i think maybe maybe i'll go into it next time are we preparing the road for them oh we preparing them for the road because if we are just preparing them uh the road for them the first time a truck comes because they're not prepared and whose fault is it the parents and even we can get older not be con you know we cannot be prepared for going through middle age right we could not be prepared for going
