[21:55] opportunity am me because we're going to
[21:57] be on streets of gold one day I know

[22:00] think we should every day is a gift I
[22:03] mean every day is a gift we're not here
[22:04] to just occupy time just to fill in a
[22:06] slot and just take up some time no every
[22:09] day is a gift of God Amen every day is
[22:12] an opportunity to praise him to walk
[22:14] with him to know him more I mean to
[22:16] enjoy him more Amen to love him more
[22:18] every day is an opportunity and it's not
[22:20] just an opportunity to love God but to
[22:22] do good unto all men especially to them
[22:25] who are the household of faith amen so
[22:27] we don't want to tear one another down
[22:29] we don't want to think negatively of one
[22:30] another we don't want to criticize one
[22:32] another no we're here to do good to one
[22:34] another cuz we're on the same team amen
[22:36] we're not against each other amen this
[22:38] is not red against blue or whatever
[22:40] color against whatever color we're on
[22:42] the same team hallelujah we're on the
[22:44] same team we have the same father we're
[22:45] being bought by the same blood amen so
[22:48] let's rally together around the word of
[22:50] God Amen let's enjoy him let's praise
[22:52] him more cuz we have an opportunity to
[22:54] walk with him in this day amen in the
[22:56] darkest of all day um ages we have an
[22:58] opportunity to walk with God like Enoch
[23:00] did so I think we should walk with him
[23:02] like never before I think we should push
[23:04] the battle I think we should lay aside
[23:06] all all foolishness I mean all
[23:08] backbiting malice Strife lies whatever
[23:11] it is lay it aside kick it out the door
[23:14] and walk with God I have no time to walk
[23:16] with lies I have no time to walk with
[23:18] half truth I have no time to walk with
[23:20] criticism if you come to criticize
[23:22] someone to me you're talking to the
[23:23] wrong person I'm not the devil's trash
[23:26] can I don't care about what other people
[23:28] do I'm walking with God and if you
[23:30] really love someone and care about them
[23:32] you'll pray for them more than anything
[23:34] else you won't criticize you won't add
[23:36] you won't spread you'll pray if you
[23:39] really love them I'm sick of this
[23:41] nonsense of lies and slander going
[23:43] around the place let's get rid of it
[23:44] right now I mean because one day you'll
[23:47] stand in front of God you'll give an
[23:48] account for that when you had an
[23:50] opportunity to bless you tried to curse
[23:52] but God will turn and say what I have
[23:53] blessed I blessed I cannot reverse it so
[23:56] why would you ever talk against a
[23:57] household of faith
[23:59] me why on Earth would you do it what a
[24:00] waste of time why entertain those
[24:02] thoughts with brother so and so do this
[24:04] sister so and so do this we're all
[24:07] human we need a body change it's going
[24:11] to be
[24:13] glorious the only one who'll never fail
[24:15] you is Jesus Christ yes sir that's just
[24:18] the that's just the that's just the be
[24:20] naked facts amen you the longer you know
[24:23] me the more I will disappoint
[24:26] you and the church said
[24:28] amen so let's just get over ourselves
[24:31] and walk with God I mean let's get over
[24:33] our complexes and our misunderstandings
[24:36] and all this nonsense and let's walk
[24:38] with God cuz I have an opportunity to be
[24:40] good to you I mean to pray for you to
[24:43] walk with you in this battle we're on
[24:45] the same team turn your gun towards the
[24:47] enemy don't fire down the trench I mean
[24:50] don't fire your brother that's charging
[24:52] forward get information get the word of
[24:55] God and start firing at the Devil amen
[24:57] don't put up this well this person said
[24:59] this and they said this 5 years ago and
[25:01] 50 years ago this happened Leave the
[25:03] Past alone I mean the devil wants to
[25:05] resurrect the past why do people want to
[25:08] resurrect what happened in the past is
[25:10] it to bring peace is it here to bring
[25:13] joy to bring love to bring
[25:15] reconciliation no it's to settle scores
[25:18] to lick Old Wounds Amen to bring up past
[25:21] hatreds all these things we can't change
[25:24] the
[25:25] past but we can change the future I mean
[25:28] we can change the present amen you can
[25:30] either be bitter because of what you've
[25:32] gone through what your family's gone
[25:33] through what you're going through or
[25:36] brother Bram said you take any anything
[25:39] to the Lord it will become a sweet
[25:43] experience I I'm a sweet tooth naturally
[25:47] Savory I a little bit but sweet you're
[25:49] talking my language amen so so any any
[25:53] any Savory experience or bitter
[25:56] experience I take it to C
[25:59] it becomes a sweet experience if you're
[26:01] sitting with bitterness in your heart
[26:03] you need to take it to the Lord you need
[26:05] to repent of holding on to it and you
[26:07] need to take it to the Lord that's a big
[26:09] problem that we don't do is we don't
[26:11] repent I mean we we we um entertain the
[26:14] devil so long we need to repent of that
[26:16] amen repentance brings separation amen
[26:19] it brings separation from your past
[26:21] brings separation from sin bring
[26:23] separation from doubt amen I God's a
[26:26] separator he separates light from
[26:28] Darkness he separates Faith from
[26:30] unbelief he separates pain from praise
[26:33] amen he separates and he only wants to
[26:36] separate you to good things not to bad
[26:38] things amen so let us walk with
[26:41] God Amen brother Bram says if you want
[26:43] to see isusa Street become a sheep
[26:46] again the prophet never criticized isusa
[26:49] Street what happened at isusa Street God
[26:51] took over the church am mean God wanted
[26:53] to speak he spoke he wanted to do this
[26:54] he did that God took over every member
[26:56] of that street Mission cuz they had a
[26:58] burden Lord we' have read your word we
[27:00] see the gifts we see the reality of the
[27:02] Holy Ghost we read about it but we want
[27:04] to taste it we want to experience it we
[27:05] want to hear it want to walk in it amen
[27:08] and so if you want to see that become a
[27:10] lamb if you want dead Message Church
[27:13] order
[27:15] only St a goat St message goat I don't
[27:19] think I'm looking at Goats tonight I
[27:20] think I'm looking at
[27:22] sheep who actually want to surrender to
[27:25] the moving of the Holy Ghost who
[27:26] actually want God to live through them
[27:30] isn't that what we gather for isn't that
[27:32] why we're Believers is that not why God
[27:35] sent Malachi for to restore us to the
[27:37] faith of the fathers and we don't live
[27:39] by gifts we live by the word and if we
[27:42] live by the word the gifts come and
[27:44] healing comes the Holy Ghost comes
[27:46] Miracles come Visions come Dreams Come
[27:49] why because we're living by the word

[28:42] been amazing to be here when Jesus was

[28:47] day is the better day amen because this

[33:27] want his Mercy Hallelujah am mean I want
[33:29] his Mercy Hallelujah and if you obtain
[33:32] Mercy then you can be merciful amen so
[33:34] if you know the mercy of God you can be
[33:36] merciful if you don't know the mercy of
[33:38] God you're not

[33:45] everything by constraint well the word
[33:48] says this and yes that's true and yes
[33:49] God did send a Prophet this is all right
[33:51] so I have to no I I live this life
[33:54] because I want to not because I have to
[33:57] not be I don't I'm not a Christian cuz
[33:59] I'm afraid of hell I'm not afraid I'm
[34:02] not a Christian cuz I'm afraid of the
[34:03] Great Tribulation I'm not a Christian
[34:05] because I'm afraid I'm going to be left
[34:07] behind I I I'm a Christian because I
[34:10] love him because he first loved me amen
[34:13] I I I live this way because he is worth
[34:16] it because he is glorious he is the king
[34:19] of all Kings he's the Lord of all Lords
[34:21] I mean he purchased my salvation on
[34:23] calvary's tree I mean when I was an
[34:24] enemy he died for me Hallelujah so this
[34:27] is why live this way not by constraint
[34:29] not because it's compulsory or or
[34:32] because of
[34:33] necessity or because of what people will
[34:35] think of
[34:36] me no we live but before the audience of
[34:41] one sure well what do you trying to say
[34:44] you don't like people's Applause and a
[34:45] God bless you to thank you I appreciate
[34:47] I appreciate all those things I'm human
[34:49] but the real audience I live before is
[34:51] him amen he's the one I'm living for
[34:54] he's the one I'm looking for amen he's
[34:56] the one who's coming back for me I mean
[34:58] I'm looking for him to come step through
[35:01] the door one day and say it's time
[35:03] you've been looking for this day it's
[35:05] time amen you used your opportunity
[35:08] hallelujah amen to walk with me in the
[35:10] season that you're alive
[35:12] in Hallelujah so amen let's just I think
[35:16] we should do that amen he says one of
[35:18] these halfway Christians supposed to be
[35:19] the most miserable person in the world
[35:21] oh I can't do this my church know it if
[35:23] I did that God knows you're doing it
[35:27] what does it make right there but have
[35:30] your whole heart centered on God and
[35:32] stay right with it then you're happy
[35:34] walking peaceably with him I mean
[35:37] someone who does things by constraint
[35:39] because it's expected of them their
[35:41] heart's not in it I say throw your whole
[35:43] heart into the Lord Jesus Christ throw
[35:45] your whole heart into the word of God
[35:47] Amen every believer that's done it has
[35:49] never regretted it amen they'll say
[35:51] absolutely it was worth it it was worth
[35:54] the pain it was worth the think about
[35:56] the worst day being a Christian
[35:58] so the worst day job ever had is better
[36:03] than the best day the devil can give
[36:06] you think about it for a second Glory
[36:09] the world wants to give you the best day
[36:11] he can give you but that is far compared
[36:14] to the worst day job ever had job's
[36:17] worst day is be I'll take that day any
[36:19] day I'll take the the best day the world
[36:21] can give me that's right that's you're a
[36:24] crazy man no my brain was Washed by the
[36:26] blood of Jesus Christ I know where I
[36:28] come from I know where I'm going
[36:30] hallelujah hallelujah so let us let us
[36:33] because we have this opport I'm just
[36:35] going to maybe I'm just going to close
[36:37] with these thoughts we have an
[36:39] opportunity let's use this opportunity
[36:42] don't let it don't let it pass through
[36:44] your hands do good to the household of
[36:47] faith well how can I do that love them
[36:49] like you love the Lord serve them like
[36:51] you serve the Lord pray for them if you
[36:53] really love them care for them send them
[36:55] how are you doing send a message I'm

[37:02] family amen we're going to we're going
[37:04] to be on the other side send send like
[37:06] encouraging quote of scripture to
[37:08] someone do good to the household see do
[37:10] good to all men but especially unto them
[37:12] who are the household of
[37:15] faith now if now if Jesus can call Judas
[37:18] friend and none of you are
[37:21] Judas what should I call
[37:25] you oh but don't you know that that
[37:28] person we got to look Beyond we got to
[37:31] we need to grow up we need to grow up
[37:33] not be tossed to and fro by sideways
[37:36] comments and this thing and this person
[37:38] and this agenda and these things throw
[37:39] those things away walk with God am
[37:42] because it's amazing how a lie can
[37:44] derail
[37:46] someone a woman comes up before brother
[37:48] baham in the 20th century Prophet
[37:50] film and and and and the Lord begins to
[37:53] discern her life you can see it there's
[37:54] a closeup there's a well I'll put it on
[37:56] the brothers and sisters everyone's I'm
[37:58] sure you've seen it she starts crying he
[38:00] says look your pastor's got polar
[38:01] there's a holster on your church oh a
[38:03] man's told a lie on you she starts
[38:05] crying a man professing Divine Healing
[38:08] and and he says to her you're not a
[38:10] witch God bless you so this woman is all
[38:13] stirred up because someone who is a
[38:16] pretending to be spiritual calls her a
[38:18] witch so that lie got her under this
[38:22] distress we had to get rid of that lie
[38:25] we had to get rid of that kind of
[38:26] nonsense amen no we're here to serve the
[38:29] Lord but you see that lie mider Liv that
[38:32] way what will the truth
[38:35] do stop har stop harboring negative
[38:38] doesn't matter how much evidence Jesus
[38:40] knew every when he was riding on the
[38:43] sand and all the Pharisees were there
[38:45] and the woman was there caught in
[38:46] adultery he could have written
[38:49] Rabbi
[38:51] Jones this day this this day this and if
[38:55] he had enough time he could have written
[38:56] his whole book of life out and then the
[38:58] next one could have written his whole
[38:59] book of life out could have written his
[39:00] whole book of life out could have
[39:02] written her book of life
[39:03] out but then when they all left he said
[39:06] neither do I condemn thee go and sin no
[39:08] more and he knew all of the her life
[39:12] everything she did and yet he looked
[39:15] beyond her fault and said I forgive you
[39:18] God said no more oh but that person said
[39:20] that the other day our lord Jesus knew
[39:23] our whole book of life you got to think
[39:24] about the magnitude we would all hate
[39:26] our thoughts to be on the screen for
[39:28] just a moment from
[39:30] today and he knew your whole book of
[39:33] life everything you said your motive
[39:35] every down to the detail detail detail
[39:38] he didn't look at that he didn't take
[39:41] that into account when he died for you
[39:42] on Calvary he so they're my daughter
[39:45] they're my son they're my child I can't
[39:48] lose them cuz they're part of
[39:51] me that's how he thought now what about
[39:53] you about one another
[39:57] what makes a goat
[39:59] resentment unconfessed sin
[40:03] unforgiveness amen all those things they
[40:05] make a goat what makes a lamb Lord take
[40:09] it all from me Lord I forgive them Lord
