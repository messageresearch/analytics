[51:30] people you don't get to see during the
[51:31] year so god bless you
[51:33] amen praise the lord um let's just go to
[51:36] the scripture
[51:37] we're going to go to ephesians 5. i
[51:39] don't have a
[51:40] i don't have a slideshow today so if you
[51:43] want to keep your bibles handy or
[51:46] maybe brother josh will be real quick on
[51:48] the trigger
[51:49] and put them up on the power point but
[51:51] um yeah god bless you happy new year
[51:53] everyone
[51:54] and um praise the lord i believe we're
[51:57] in for a great year
[52:00] well how can you not have a great year
[52:01] when you're walking with the lord you
[52:03] know
[52:03] so ephesians 5 and we're going to read
[52:05] from verse 13 down to 17 then we're
[52:07] going to go to the book of
[52:08] habakkuk um we're going to read some
[52:11] scripture from there as well could you
[52:12] turn me down a little bit that'd be real
[52:13] good
[52:14] he says but all things that are
[52:18] approved are made manifest by the light
[52:22] for whatsoever doth make manifest is
[52:25] light
[52:26] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[52:28] sleepeth and arise
[52:30] from the dead and christ shall give thee
[52:32] light
[52:34] see then that you will walk
[52:37] circumspectly
[52:38] not as fools but as wise
[52:41] redeeming the time because the days are
[52:43] evil wherefore
[52:45] be ye not unwise but understanding
[52:49] what the will of the lord is so we've
[52:52] got to walk wisely in this world
[52:53] we can't just we can't just plow through
[52:55] and meander around
[52:57] we're going to walk wisely now let's go
[52:58] to have a in verse chapter 1 and verse
[53:01] 12.
[53:04] um i mentioned this well
[53:08] every service just merges into one so
[53:09] i'll just say a couple of services ago
[53:12] so are we do we have that habakkuk 1 and
[53:14] 12.
[53:17] i don't think i've ever really preached
[53:20] from this book that i
[53:22] you know we're still trying to recover
[53:24] from lots of late nights and
[53:27] you know so if i appear to stumble
[53:28] around you just pray for me you know
[53:30] one day we'll not be tired hallelujah
[53:33] but um
[53:34] you know it's like watch night we drove
[53:35] all the way from tauranga
[53:37] pretty much rolled out of the car got
[53:38] changed rolled into here head watch
[53:41] night you know so
[53:42] we're still kind of convincing in that
[53:44] kind of way
[53:45] amen have a quick one and twelve
[53:49] art thou art thou not from everlasting
[53:52] o lord my god my holy one
[53:56] we shall not die o lord thou hast
[53:58] ordained them for judgment
[54:00] and o mighty god thou hast established
[54:02] them for correction
[54:05] thou art of purer eyes than to behold
[54:08] evil
[54:08] and can us not look on iniquity
[54:11] wherefore
[54:12] looketh thou upon them that deal
[54:15] treacherously
[54:17] and hold us thy tongue when the wicked
[54:19] devoureth
[54:20] the men that is more righteous than he
[54:23] and maketh men as the fishes of the sea
[54:26] as the creeping things that have no
[54:29] ruler over them
[54:31] they take up all of them with the angle
[54:34] and that angle means a hook they catch
[54:37] them in their net
[54:38] and gather them in their drag therefore
[54:40] they rejoice in a glad
[54:42] therefore they sacrifice unto their net
[54:45] and burn incense
[54:46] unto their drag because by them their
[54:48] portion is fat and they meet plenteous
[54:52] shall they therefore empty their net and
[54:54] not spare continually
[54:56] to slay the nations now this may seem a
[54:59] bit obscure but
[55:00] there's a net upon this earth
[55:04] but the redeemed of the lord ordained to
[55:05] escape it
[55:07] amen let's just be our heads in a word
[55:09] of prayer lord jesus
[55:12] lord to not just sing a song that we're
[55:16] walking in units of life but
[55:18] lord have the reality of those words in
[55:20] our lives lord that it's a it's a
[55:22] testimony we sing
[55:24] lord that you've set us free from all
[55:26] our sin
[55:27] and you've shown us what true life is
[55:29] lord your life
[55:31] how thankful we are lord that we don't
[55:33] just have natural life
[55:35] we are striving for just natural things
[55:37] but you've given us your own life
[55:39] lord you've imparted eternal life into
[55:41] our souls and
[55:42] i just want to thank you for that this
[55:44] morning that we can say lord we are not
[55:46] our own but we're yours
[55:48] and such a joy a privilege to be one of
[55:50] yours lord to not be our own
[55:52] i just want to pray lord as we have read
[55:54] your word i probably
[55:55] say the same kind of prayer every
[55:57] service but lord i
[55:58] lord i always desire that you would come
[56:00] and lord you would anoint your
[56:02] word to our hearts lord anoint it to our
[56:04] anoint our ears to hear
[56:06] and and our hearts to receive and lord
[56:08] may you the great author of the book
[56:10] lord may you step forth and speak the
[56:12] words of life lord
[56:14] i haven't come to uh hear from
[56:17] me lord or my thoughts lord i'm not
[56:19] interested in my thoughts law that's
[56:21] they're not worth nothing but lord your
[56:23] thoughts are eternal and that's what we
[56:25] have come
[56:25] to hear lord is your word lord your
[56:27] thoughts and
[56:28] lord that we would be changed and molded
[56:30] and shaped and made more like you and
[56:33] just want to pray lord that as your word
[56:35] says that we are washed
[56:36] by the water of the word i pray oh god
[56:38] may
[56:39] may you wash lord jesus where we need to
[56:41] be washed lord jesus we
[56:43] we need you to come and cleanse us we
[56:45] can't walk in this world with our own
[56:47] mind our own smarts what we know lord we
[56:50] need you o lord we need your wisdom we
[56:52] need your mind so i pray oh god may you
[56:54] just come and
[56:55] direct our steps lord jesus we just want
[56:57] to commit our lives into your hands we
[56:59] thank you are not our own
[57:00] we are yours lord i pray you touch each
[57:03] life here lord those who may be watching
[57:04] now as well or who will watch this lord
[57:06] i
[57:07] pray you touch their lives oh god and
[57:09] may may you be so real and near to each
[57:11] and every one of us today lord those
[57:13] sick and body
[57:14] lord may you heal them as well dear god
[57:16] we thank you for this new year
[57:18] lord we pray for your bride around the
[57:19] world as well lord may you
[57:21] encourage and strengthen her o lord in
[57:23] this in this resurrection season that
[57:25] we're in
[57:26] we thank you lord for this privilege to
[57:27] be gathered together i pray you just
[57:30] be with us now in jesus christ's name
[57:32] amen
[57:33] amen god bless you so you may have your
[57:34] seats this morning so
[57:38] we're going to go back into ephesians
[57:40] later but you know paul tells us that we
[57:42] need to walk
[57:42] circumspect leaks not as fools but as
[57:45] wise and
[57:46] and i'm sure we can agree that that this
[57:48] age that we're living in
[57:49] we need wisdom to walk in this world we
[57:51] really need human
[57:52] you know not human wisdom not not not
[57:54] walking by
[57:55] how our society tells us or by culture
[57:57] or you know but but
[57:59] by the mind of christ and and i and i'm
[58:01] very thankful that i believe i'm looking
[58:03] at a people that have the mind of christ
[58:04] it's not something that
[58:05] one day we will receive it but we have
[58:07] it now if the holy ghost is in you you
[58:09] have the mind of christ now
[58:11] i read this from from habakkuk maybe you
[58:13] just want to put that um
[58:14] back up again but you know this net that
[58:17] that he is speaking of here
[58:19] uh to me it is not the same net as jesus
[58:21] would
[58:22] would loud in the parable of the you
[58:24] know in in matthew 13 which is the
[58:26] kingdom of god
[58:27] is or the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[58:29] a net because this net that is spread
[58:32] is to just destroy but the but the
[58:35] parable that jesus speaks about the
[58:37] gospel net that gospel neck goes out the
[58:39] word goes out because god wants to
[58:40] gather a people to himself but
[58:42] this one here all it wants to do is is
[58:45] to destroy now
[58:46] if we if we go down to if we go down to
[58:49] verse 15
[58:51] you know and they take and they take up
[58:53] all of them
[58:54] so this is speaking of a great this is
[58:56] not just a small group people is the
[58:57] whole world
[58:59] with the angle which is the hook they
[59:00] catch them in their net and they gather
[59:02] them in their drag now
[59:03] drag is a dragnet like how you know
[59:05] trawlers pull a net along that's
[59:07] that's that's a drag therefore they glad
[59:10] and i rejoice therefore they sacrifice
[59:12] unto their net
[59:13] and they burn incense under their drag
[59:15] so they they're worshiping
[59:17] this thing that they're using to catch
[59:19] people with
[59:20] they are sacrificing to it you know
[59:22] they're burning incense they're actually
[59:23] putting effort into this thing because
[59:24] they want it to be
[59:25] uh bitterly designed you know betterly
[59:28] if that's a word you know
[59:30] you know they want a more efficient net
[59:31] you know they so so they give their
[59:33] energies
[59:34] and and the reason they do that is
[59:36] because by them
[59:37] so so by their net and by their drag
[59:40] their portion is fat these people are
[59:41] getting rich they're
[59:43] they're living off this and their meat
[59:45] is plenteous
[59:47] and so verse 17 shall they therefore
[59:49] empty their net and not
[59:50] spare continually to slay the nation so
[59:54] we know if you look into the history of
[59:55] warfare there has never been a physical
[59:58] net device that can actually destroy the
[1:00:00] whole world
[1:00:01] so this is not a natural net we're
[1:00:02] talking about this is a spiritual net
[1:00:05] and to me this is the world wide web
[1:00:10] right so it's more than just a abstract
[1:00:12] thing this is actually
[1:00:13] in play right now 100 years ago it
[1:00:16] wasn't even an idea
[1:00:18] fifty years ago maybe it was a very very
[1:00:20] elementary thing but now
[1:00:22] it's spread around the whole world so
[1:00:25] and it is designed to continually slay
[1:00:28] the nations
[1:00:29] now this word nations now if we just
[1:00:32] kind of meander through this today well
[1:00:34] we'll we'll get somewhere then we'll
[1:00:36] close and maybe we'll pick it up another
[1:00:38] time but i just want this to sink kind
[1:00:39] of deep because we need to
[1:00:40] we need wisdom remember there's nothing
[1:00:43] and and we're going to later there's
[1:00:44] nothing wrong with the internet
[1:00:46] as a as a medium just like there's
[1:00:48] nothing wrong with the printed
[1:00:49] nothing wrong with the printing press
[1:00:51] nothing wrong with radio
[1:00:53] as a medium or the television as a
[1:00:55] medium right the device itself is not
[1:00:57] evil
[1:00:58] it's what's on it that can be evil or
[1:00:59] good because even now we're streaming
[1:01:01] this over the world wide web
[1:01:03] hoping we'll ensnare someone i mean that
[1:01:05] they'll be caught up into the lord
[1:01:07] become a prisoner
[1:01:08] a love prisoner to jesus christ that
[1:01:09] that's their motive that we're doing it
[1:01:11] but
[1:01:11] the devil's motive is not that is to
[1:01:13] destroy people
[1:01:15] now this word too so so to me this
[1:01:18] this is not a natural net i'm sure you
[1:01:20] can agree with me here
[1:01:22] it's it's spread out over the whole
[1:01:23] world and to me this is
[1:01:25] what the devil has set up in this day to
[1:01:27] ensnare and kill people
[1:01:29] spiritually because if he can ward off
[1:01:32] your mind if he can if
[1:01:33] he can shut down even any hunger or
[1:01:35] desire for god
[1:01:36] he's got you remember the lord can you
[1:01:39] know lazarus was four days in the grave
[1:01:41] dead
[1:01:41] mary and martha thought all hopes are
[1:01:43] gone it's impossible but but then the
[1:01:44] resurrection life turned up
[1:01:46] to bring him back to life so even if we
[1:01:48] mentally think well
[1:01:49] that person's beyond they're never
[1:01:51] beyond if there's life in their bodies
[1:01:52] there's hope
[1:01:54] hallelujah and i'm glad that that's the
[1:01:55] case amen so
[1:01:58] so this word nation so shall not
[1:02:00] continually to slay the nations
[1:02:03] um this says here so it means a group of
[1:02:06] people
[1:02:07] it means a foreign nation or also means
[1:02:09] a gentile
[1:02:10] now when we speak of a gentile when we
[1:02:13] go into the book of ephesians
[1:02:14] when when um paul speaks of don't
[1:02:17] walkers other gentiles walk which we'll
[1:02:19] go into he's actually speaking of
[1:02:20] people who are pagans so you're not
[1:02:22] speaking of other non-jewish people in
[1:02:24] the sense of just a race
[1:02:25] spirit people are not believers so he's
[1:02:28] saying that this net will
[1:02:29] actually ensnare and slay those who are
[1:02:31] not believers
[1:02:35] remember we have the thing that can cut
[1:02:37] the net okay so this may sound pretty
[1:02:39] all we're enjoying this big trap and
[1:02:41] this is all a big trouble no
[1:02:42] we have what we we have the tool to cut
[1:02:45] the net
[1:02:46] and free those who are who are ensnared
[1:02:48] by it
[1:02:49] now brother braham says
[1:02:53] um he doesn't use the word net per se
[1:02:55] that i could find maybe if i looked a
[1:02:56] bit more but
[1:02:57] he uses the word web and he says and as
[1:03:00] eagle
[1:03:00] as the eagles stir with her nest in 1957
[1:03:03] men and women who are born to be free
[1:03:05] who are born to
[1:03:06] be born to be sons and daughters of god
[1:03:08] to live above sin and away from sin
[1:03:11] is carousing the bar rooms and dance
[1:03:13] laws because that a web like a spider
[1:03:16] has raked them around and around until
[1:03:18] they've until they've caught them into
[1:03:20] that thing
[1:03:21] and then and then notice how what he
[1:03:23] ties how they've been caught into it on
[1:03:25] uncensored programs
[1:03:27] the schools and arithmetic teachers so
[1:03:30] atheistic teachers and all the modern
[1:03:33] divisions of the devil
[1:03:35] and sorry to say this but many times the
[1:03:36] modern church who let them go loosely do
[1:03:39] do anything they want as long as they
[1:03:41] belong to church so he's saying
[1:03:42] this is this is the way that that people
[1:03:44] get ensnared in this net now he says in
[1:03:46] the message shalom
[1:03:47] 1964 but you notice a woman in our day
[1:03:52] they don't seem to have that lady like
[1:03:54] they once had
[1:03:56] they just um they're just like they want
[1:03:59] to
[1:04:00] but there's something that won't say
[1:04:03] they're just like they want to but
[1:04:04] there's something won't let them do it
[1:04:06] it seems like there's a heaviness you
[1:04:08] ever seen people who've got a heaviness
[1:04:09] on them
[1:04:10] they're not free and happy and you know
[1:04:12] you know you can have a lot of burdens
[1:04:14] but there's difference between having a
[1:04:15] burden and a desire and wanting to see
[1:04:17] something happen
[1:04:17] then having a heaviness
[1:04:21] that now that you tell a lady that she
[1:04:23] should not do such and such a thing and
[1:04:25] the lady looks upon that and believes
[1:04:26] that
[1:04:27] she wants to believe it but there's
[1:04:28] something that presses her the other way
[1:04:30] see
[1:04:31] poor thing i feel sorry for her she's so
[1:04:33] caught in such a web of hollywood
[1:04:36] and advertisements in television radio
[1:04:39] and newspaper
[1:04:40] on the street in the store windows with
[1:04:43] modern dress
[1:04:44] and so forth so he's just listed that
[1:04:46] was that was all the mediums in which
[1:04:48] things were advertised in those days
[1:04:50] that was the television the radio and
[1:04:52] the newspaper and on the street
[1:04:53] billboards and so on
[1:04:55] with modern dress and so forth and the
[1:04:57] way
[1:04:58] that other women meet her so even as as
[1:05:01] as how other women were meeting it was
[1:05:03] actually pushing them into this web of
[1:05:05] hollywood
[1:05:06] so you got to be very careful how people
[1:05:07] you know we can be so we can pick up
[1:05:09] other
[1:05:10] you know you know other people's spirits
[1:05:11] we're going to admire someone even you
[1:05:12] know in the world saying
[1:05:13] and we can actually pick up the spirit
[1:05:15] that's on them because we want to be
[1:05:17] like them
[1:05:17] and that actually presses us into this
[1:05:19] web
[1:05:20] yeah yeah peer pressure's a real thing
[1:05:23] it's not just a buzz word it's a or a
[1:05:25] phrase it's a real thing
[1:05:27] and so this is and the way that the
[1:05:28] other women meet her so that's actually
[1:05:29] a peer pressure
[1:05:31] maybe subconsciously being pushed upon
[1:05:33] her to act a certain way
[1:05:35] because you've got to fit in with the
[1:05:36] crowd
[1:05:38] there's one crowd i want to fit in with
[1:05:40] that's the redeemed of the law
[1:05:42] and it seems to be that there is
[1:05:44] something that they just can't pull away
[1:05:46] from
[1:05:47] but notice how who he lives here our
[1:05:49] young people
[1:05:50] our old people our middle age so it's
[1:05:53] not just a certain bracket of
[1:05:54] age or what it's it's everyone that this
[1:05:56] could be caught into this web
[1:05:58] now as i now as i said brother brown
[1:06:01] list television radio newspaper now
[1:06:03] as i said this is just a medium in which
[1:06:05] a a message is transmitted so
[1:06:07] once upon a time we never had printed
[1:06:09] books like this
[1:06:10] you know when when jesus would step into
[1:06:12] the synagogue and open the book of
[1:06:15] isaiah it was a scroll
[1:06:16] that's how that's how the message was
[1:06:18] written down and then eventually
[1:06:19] uh you know in the 1400s whatever they
[1:06:21] actually got the printing press it
[1:06:23] wasn't handwritten down
[1:06:24] you know and they used to bind books
[1:06:26] like this but they were far bigger so
[1:06:28] you know but then the medium slowly
[1:06:30] changed and eventually now i can read
[1:06:31] the same bible on here
[1:06:33] same words same message different
[1:06:35] different medium that it's transmitted
[1:06:37] on
[1:06:38] so we can take these things and all that
[1:06:41] all that television radio and newspaper
[1:06:43] has evolved into
[1:06:44] is social media and the internet which
[1:06:47] is called the world wide web
[1:06:50] so now as i said before we know that
[1:06:52] television radio newspapers the internet
[1:06:54] they're just mediums to get a message
[1:06:56] across it used to be it'd be by a
[1:06:58] carrier pigeon or morse code
[1:07:00] or there'd be a telegram some way to
[1:07:01] send a send a message now it's just
[1:07:04] well the whole world can tune into this
[1:07:05] if they got internet
[1:07:07] so it's not the it's not the medium of
[1:07:09] television or radio newspapers see you
[1:07:12] can use those things for good
[1:07:14] amen just like just like these
[1:07:16] instruments here these instruments can
[1:07:18] either be used
[1:07:19] there's nothing wrong with the
[1:07:20] instrument it's
[1:07:22] it's the one who's playing it can either
[1:07:24] call on the devil or can call on god
[1:07:27] right remember boogie woogie or rock and
[1:07:28] roll was actually first devised on a
[1:07:30] piano
[1:07:32] so you know it's not about the the
[1:07:34] device or the medium
[1:07:35] it's what's played over it is the
[1:07:37] problem
[1:07:39] so that's why you know so it's the
[1:07:42] there's nothing wrong with the medium of
[1:07:43] television radio newspapers the internet
[1:07:45] social media
[1:07:46] it's the content on those platforms is
[1:07:47] what traps people
[1:07:49] see it's the that content and i'll go
[1:07:52] into this maybe
[1:07:53] later later time but the content on
[1:07:55] those things exploits people's
[1:07:57] insecurities
[1:07:59] in such a way because they want to find
[1:08:01] where they fit in the world
[1:08:03] where do i belong who you know am i i'm
[1:08:05] with this group or this group how should
[1:08:07] i be you know
[1:08:08] and it exploits that insecurity even
[1:08:10] even how we look how we talk how we
[1:08:12] dress the car we
[1:08:13] you know the job the things with the
[1:08:15] other material things it exploits an
[1:08:17] insecurity
[1:08:17] people who are insecure not comfortable
[1:08:19] in the fact they may have nothing
[1:08:21] you know i've met people you know who
[1:08:22] have literally nothing and they're happy
[1:08:25] and they're not down you know as i said
[1:08:27] i think last time i was in papua new
[1:08:28] guinea we went round by the city dumped
[1:08:30] to go get some firewood
[1:08:31] and people are scavenging through the
[1:08:33] rubbish to get aluminium cans to sell
[1:08:35] that they can get money they're not
[1:08:37] walking along like this and life is
[1:08:39] horrible and i
[1:08:40] can't oh this is my lot and this is
[1:08:42] terrible they were smiling
[1:08:44] hello how are you morning through all
[1:08:46] ghetto yeah my hammer must be look at
[1:08:47] you now yeah yeah
[1:08:48] they're happy hello you know but this is
[1:08:50] what they're doing they're not paid to
[1:08:51] do it
[1:08:52] they just have to find the cans and get
[1:08:53] money for it but they're content they're
[1:08:56] not insecure in who they are
[1:08:59] but then a lot of people they would you
[1:09:00] know you you put the west
[1:09:02] into that kind of condition you know
[1:09:04] they'll think their life has fallen
[1:09:05] apart
[1:09:08] how can you take a selfie with that in
[1:09:09] the background this is my day
[1:09:11] hashtag i don't know saving the planet
[1:09:13] or whatever you want to do
[1:09:14] you know it's not going to work but so
[1:09:17] it exploits insecurities in people
[1:09:19] and also we know that it also appeals to
[1:09:21] the carnal nature of man because we know
[1:09:23] sin is enticing
[1:09:25] you know we'd be lying to say well
[1:09:26] there's nothing to it because if there's
[1:09:28] nothing to it it won't be
[1:09:29] you know it wouldn't be a multi-trillion
[1:09:31] trillion dollar industry
[1:09:33] so there's something to it because it
[1:09:34] appeals to this guy
[1:09:36] so well you might say well then i'll
[1:09:38] just cut the internet out of my house
[1:09:39] i'll just you know cut the landline
[1:09:41] y'all cut you know get all
[1:09:42] get rid of all the smart devices you
[1:09:44] know then i'll keep my family i'll keep
[1:09:46] myself i'll keep my children safe
[1:09:48] that won't work that won't work because
[1:09:51] unfortunately or fortunately actually i
[1:09:53] thank god
[1:09:55] i can i can um you know pass the emosses
[1:09:58] on a mission trip in garoka another part
[1:10:00] of papua new guinea
[1:10:01] he's on facebook messenger he's sending
[1:10:02] me photos saying how the convention is
[1:10:05] going things are going oh thank god
[1:10:07] that we can be in touch like that i'm
[1:10:09] really glad it's not a slow boat to
[1:10:11] china kind of snail mail two months
[1:10:12] later i might get a letter and
[1:10:14] you know but we can talk you know so i
[1:10:17] thank god for technology
[1:10:18] but you got to use it the right way and
[1:10:21] the thing is it is an integral part of
[1:10:23] the world in which we live
[1:10:25] it is you can't function in the first
[1:10:26] world and it's coming into the third
[1:10:28] world too the developing world you can't
[1:10:30] function without the internet
[1:10:33] unfortunately that's just how it is well
[1:10:36] wouldn't life be easier or not no but we
[1:10:38] we sure it would be but we have to use
[1:10:41] these tools
[1:10:42] we can't delete it we can't get rid of
[1:10:44] it it's part of our lives
[1:10:45] but it's how we use it but the internet
[1:10:49] and everything that's on it this
[1:10:50] worldwide web
[1:10:52] is like a landmine i mean you know it's
[1:10:55] like a minefield
[1:10:56] with snares and traps on it but the
[1:10:59] thing is
[1:10:59] the only uh danger
[1:11:02] of a minefield is if you don't know
[1:11:04] where the mines are
[1:11:06] if you know where all the mines are
[1:11:07] you're not going to be terrified you're
[1:11:08] going to step on a mine
[1:11:10] you can just walk through it oh there's
[1:11:12] a mine you know there's there's stories
[1:11:14] from
[1:11:15] one of the um you know israeli wars
[1:11:18] where the
[1:11:18] and you know you know a platoon or
[1:11:20] whatever is coming into a
[1:11:21] you know you know you know they're at
[1:11:23] night i think they're gonna make an
[1:11:24] attack or something and they find
[1:11:25] themselves
[1:11:26] stumbled into a minefield but then a
[1:11:28] wind blows
[1:11:29] pushes all the sand away and they can
[1:11:31] see where the mines are and they walk
[1:11:32] through
[1:11:34] so you know you'd be you'd be freaking
[1:11:36] out it's like if you find yourself in
[1:11:37] the middle of a minefield you and you're
[1:11:38] trying to do a sneak attacks you can't
[1:11:40] just
[1:11:40] you know and you've got to try and get
[1:11:41] through these mines but if you see them
[1:11:44] well
[1:11:44] there they are i don't need to be afraid
[1:11:46] of this i can walk in this place there
[1:11:47] can be a mine right there i can walk
[1:11:49] right through it it's not going to harm
[1:11:50] me because i know where it is
[1:11:52] i mean so it's the same thing with the
[1:11:54] internet or social media whatever you
[1:11:55] you know all those things youtube etc
[1:11:58] you know if you know where the mines are
[1:11:59] all the snares and the traps you can
[1:12:01] still use it
[1:12:03] but it means you won't get blown up
[1:12:08] now standing on a mine doesn't always
[1:12:11] kill someone but they get severely
[1:12:13] maimed
[1:12:14] and how they walked before they stood on
[1:12:17] the mind to afterwards is very different
[1:12:20] they they either lose a limb both limbs
[1:12:22] or maybe they're just so
[1:12:23] mad they just can't walk like they used
[1:12:25] to now that happens in the
[1:12:27] physical but the same happens in the
[1:12:29] spiritual
[1:12:30] where you you know you kind of open a
[1:12:32] website or you scroll through something
[1:12:34] and you just something just gets
[1:12:35] imprinted into your spirit
[1:12:37] and you weren't looking for it but it
[1:12:38] found you and it can kind of change how
[1:12:41] you walk with the lord
[1:12:43] because you can sit there under
[1:12:44] condemnation
[1:12:46] and thinking well you know this is all
[1:12:47] my fault and you know and you can even
[1:12:49] begin to open yourself up to a spirit
[1:12:52] and so now afterwards your walk with god
[1:12:54] is very different to how it was before
[1:12:56] you open that thing
[1:12:58] are we all together hallelujah
[1:13:02] see the thing is when when when
[1:13:05] something is presented to you
[1:13:07] you have to accept it so on the on the
[1:13:10] positive side
[1:13:11] if you want the holy ghost to come and
[1:13:12] fill your life you've got to agree with
[1:13:14] his word
[1:13:15] that's how that's how you really receive
[1:13:16] the holy ghost you receive the word
[1:13:19] right yes but then in order to then on
[1:13:22] the negative
[1:13:22] in order to to to receive a evil spirit
[1:13:26] you've got to agree with that spirit
[1:13:28] now see what happens is you can expose
[1:13:31] yourself to something online that you
[1:13:32] weren't necessarily looking for
[1:13:35] but then that spirit will try and make
[1:13:37] you entertain it
[1:13:38] so if there's a spirit of lust or
[1:13:40] whatever it may be on that thing
[1:13:41] it tries to get you to entertain that
[1:13:43] spirit
[1:13:45] now how do you how do you entertain
[1:13:47] someone
[1:13:48] you make them feel welcome right you
[1:13:51] make them feel welcome you know you
[1:13:52] serve them you you give them food you
[1:13:54] you know give them a good time but then
[1:13:56] how do you entertain a spirit
[1:13:58] well you entertain it by meditating
[1:14:01] on the thoughts that it gives you that's
[1:14:04] how you
[1:14:05] that's how you entertain the spirit now
[1:14:08] in order to not entertain someone you
[1:14:10] don't give them a nice time
[1:14:12] you don't make them feel welcome you
[1:14:13] kick them out and it's the same thing
[1:14:15] with the spirit that's how you do not
[1:14:16] entertain a spirit
[1:14:18] it tries to bring a thought into your
[1:14:19] mind you just get rid of that thought so
[1:14:21] i'm not giving you another second in my
[1:14:23] in my brain hallelujah and eventually
[1:14:27] that thing will go you've got to
[1:14:28] remember you've got to draw an eye unto
[1:14:30] god he'll draw nine to you resist the
[1:14:32] devil and he shall flee
[1:14:33] so you've got to draw an eye to god
[1:14:35] he'll draw an eye to you then you resist
[1:14:37] him
[1:14:38] so that thing comes into your mind you
[1:14:39] got to say no no i'm not thinking about
[1:14:41] this this is not this is not my portion
[1:14:43] this is not who i meant to be
[1:14:45] what you're resisting hallelujah i'm
[1:14:48] glad we have a we have a resistance
[1:14:50] amen it's not something that can get
[1:14:52] overcome no no our resistance works
[1:14:55] hallelujah i mean so so for example
[1:14:59] i just i i just put one example down
[1:15:03] depressive thoughts result from a spirit
[1:15:06] of depression
[1:15:07] that's how you know if someone's feeling
[1:15:09] down and they think always negative and
[1:15:11] thinking bad about themselves their
[1:15:13] ability
[1:15:14] it's actually a spirit making them feel
[1:15:15] that way
[1:15:17] and if they keep thinking about those
[1:15:18] things see see if the devil tells you
[1:15:20] and he will never say you're useless
[1:15:22] he'll just say
[1:15:22] man i'm just so useless i can't do that
[1:15:25] right i stuff this up i can't even
[1:15:28] you know i'm doing this wrong with my
[1:15:29] children and this is going on i can't
[1:15:31] you know what is that that's a negative
[1:15:32] thought pattern
[1:15:33] where did that negative thought pattern
[1:15:34] come from it's not from god because god
[1:15:36] says i can do all things through christ
[1:15:38] which strengthens me
[1:15:39] all things hallelujah but then that
[1:15:41] spirit comes along
[1:15:43] and it tries to make you think that way
[1:15:45] and if you keep thinking that way you're
[1:15:46] entertaining that spirit
[1:15:48] which will result in you having a spirit
[1:15:50] of of depression
[1:15:52] and that thought pattern will become
[1:15:53] normal
[1:15:55] right thinking bad about yourself your
[1:15:58] ability other people
[1:15:59] other believers that becomes a normal
[1:16:01] thought pattern but that's not meant to
[1:16:03] be our thought pattern
[1:16:04] our thought patterns mean to be positive
[1:16:06] whatsoever things are good lovely honest
[1:16:08] truth think on those things
[1:16:10] hallelujah i mean no person was ever
[1:16:13] born
[1:16:14] to think bad about themselves in a
[1:16:17] depressive way
[1:16:19] well then how do i get rid of it well
[1:16:21] true repentance will bring deliverance
[1:16:24] amen and it will bring healing from the
[1:16:26] effects so for example you know
[1:16:28] a natural hospital someone who stands on
[1:16:30] a landmine
[1:16:31] they may be mad forever but they can
[1:16:33] never grow their limb back
[1:16:35] but then in the spiritual you can be
[1:16:37] half blown in two
[1:16:39] but god can put you back like it never
[1:16:41] happened holy and then you have the
[1:16:42] memory thank god i got fixed
[1:16:44] hallelujah so so it's not a patch up job
[1:16:47] and well
[1:16:48] i'm sorry you're just going to have to
[1:16:49] have these spiritual crutches for the
[1:16:50] rest of your life
[1:16:51] oh no just like our brother john andy's
[1:16:54] preached the last youth without borders
[1:16:55] he said
[1:16:56] the reason for going to the wound
[1:16:57] healing center is to leave the wound
[1:16:59] healing center
[1:17:00] it's like you go to the doctor you don't
[1:17:01] go to the doctor to live there
[1:17:03] you go to the doctor to leave the doctor
[1:17:05] i mean it's just like you come and meet
[1:17:06] the lord you've got a problem you've got
[1:17:07] something in your spirit
[1:17:08] you don't go to him and just live in
[1:17:10] that kind of condition and say well i
[1:17:11] guess i'll never get made well no
[1:17:13] you go to him to get healed that you
[1:17:14] don't have to stay sick
[1:17:16] amen you go to the healer to leave the
[1:17:18] healer if that makes sense right
[1:17:20] hallelujah amen this can only but
[1:17:23] but having a true repentance saying lord
[1:17:25] forgive me i even open myself up to this
[1:17:27] thing
[1:17:27] it can only come by actually hating that
[1:17:29] spirit
[1:17:31] if if anyone loves a spirit and
[1:17:34] and and how do you love a spirit you
[1:17:36] love a spirit by
[1:17:37] thinking that you're justified to think
[1:17:39] or feel that way
[1:17:41] just like brother brahm said about the
[1:17:42] maniac who came on the platform in
[1:17:44] oregon
[1:17:45] brother bam says he justified it does
[1:17:47] not
[1:17:48] not verbatim but he basically that that
[1:17:50] maniac was not delivered
[1:17:52] because he worshipped that spirit
[1:17:53] thinking he was right
[1:17:55] so that's why he still had that spirit
[1:17:56] he thought he was right on what he was
[1:17:58] doing
[1:17:59] and the devil always try and give you
[1:18:00] enough evidence to actually validate
[1:18:03] the reason you are but we know he's a
[1:18:06] liar even if he's telling truth he's
[1:18:07] lying
[1:18:08] say you think hold up mr devil you're a
[1:18:10] liar and you're the father of lies
[1:18:12] see even if you're giving 99.99 truth
[1:18:15] you're still a liar so
[1:18:20] hallelujah amen as brother tazewell said
[1:18:22] it camp satan you're a liar
[1:18:26] amen anyways we'll be alive because he
[1:18:28] can't change
[1:18:30] so if you actually validate yourself
[1:18:33] justify
[1:18:34] you know if you hate the spirit you can
[1:18:35] be free but if you love it you'll never
[1:18:37] be free that's why we love the lord
[1:18:38] we'll never be free from him
[1:18:40] not that we want to be free but because
[1:18:41] we love that holy spirit we love his
[1:18:43] presence
[1:18:43] we love his goodness you can't be free
[1:18:45] from that
[1:18:46] not that we ever want to be free but you
[1:18:48] know you take from the negative you come
[1:18:49] to the positive
[1:18:51] don't you love his presence isn't he
[1:18:52] good you know he's so wonderful
[1:18:54] hallelujah now we'll go back to
[1:18:56] ephesians uh chapter four
[1:18:58] i'm going to read from verse 15 we're
[1:19:00] just going to kind of break this down
[1:19:01] you know
[1:19:02] um i really enjoy you know some well
[1:19:05] this is me you know
[1:19:06] i can just plow through a book i don't
[1:19:09] really get too much but i'll say i
[1:19:10] wonder what this word means
[1:19:11] it actually makes sense once i know what
[1:19:13] the words mean so
[1:19:14] if you may think boy you're a dummy well
[1:19:16] forgive me
[1:19:17] we're going to go through some words so
[1:19:19] ephesians 4 and 15.
[1:19:22] now now just a background to this
[1:19:25] the apostle paul before the lord
[1:19:27] inspires him to write this section of
[1:19:29] this chapter
[1:19:30] he's speaking about until you know until
[1:19:32] we all grow into the fullness of christ
[1:19:34] so he's talking about now this is where
[1:19:35] we're going he says we have the holy
[1:19:38] ghost we're filled with the spirit in
[1:19:39] chapter one but now we're going to grow
[1:19:41] into the fullness of the statue of
[1:19:42] christ so this is what he has in mind
[1:19:45] when he's about to give these
[1:19:47] instructions he says now but speaking
[1:19:49] the truth and love
[1:19:50] may grow up into him in all things which
[1:19:52] is the head even christ
[1:19:54] from whom the whole body is fitly joined
[1:19:56] together and compacted by that which
[1:19:58] every joint supplier
[1:20:00] according to the effectual working and
[1:20:02] the measure of every part
[1:20:03] maketh increase of the body unto the
[1:20:06] edifying of itself in love
[1:20:09] i say this therefore so because what
[1:20:11] i've just said i'm
[1:20:12] i'm about to say this bit okay so i say
[1:20:15] this therefore
[1:20:16] this i say therefore sorry and testify
[1:20:18] in the lord that he henceforth
[1:20:20] now we're in verse 17 yep thank you that
[1:20:23] he henceforth so from now on
[1:20:25] walk not as other gentiles now this word
[1:20:28] gentile
[1:20:29] by implication means a pagan so it's not
[1:20:32] it's not talking about other gentiles
[1:20:34] like other non-jews talk about people
[1:20:35] are not believers
[1:20:36] so don't walk as are the gentiles or
[1:20:39] people who are pagans
[1:20:40] in the vanity of their mind now this
[1:20:43] word vanity
[1:20:45] it means uh in utility which will get
[1:20:48] into that
[1:20:49] but also means a transientness now what
[1:20:52] is transientness thing that
[1:20:53] something just passes through it comes
[1:20:55] and goes it changes
[1:20:59] and so their thoughts so so the thoughts
[1:21:01] of these gentiles these pagans
[1:21:04] uh uh are vain thoughts they have vanity
[1:21:07] in their mind
[1:21:09] and that vanity is a transientness now
[1:21:11] just just just just follow me
[1:21:12] so it just changes it just changes like
[1:21:15] the weather
[1:21:16] you have four seasons in one day this is
[1:21:17] how they're changing you know this is
[1:21:19] how their thoughts
[1:21:19] you know in the morning they think about
[1:21:21] something this way then mid morning they
[1:21:23] think about it this way then they hear
[1:21:24] something else they think about it this
[1:21:25] way it just changes then maybe it'll
[1:21:27] swap all the way back to the beginning
[1:21:28] but it's not steadfast it just it's just
[1:21:31] tossed to and fro
[1:21:33] now this so it just changes like the
[1:21:36] weather
[1:21:36] or in other words their thinking just
[1:21:39] changes to whatsoever is trending at the
[1:21:42] time
[1:21:43] so what's trending you know you know
[1:21:44] there's there's twitter feeds there's
[1:21:46] trending this is trending people get
[1:21:47] caught up all this thought in this way
[1:21:49] what's happening
[1:21:49] their thinking is transient it's just
[1:21:52] jumping back and forth
[1:21:55] now in utility which is this word vanity
[1:21:59] it's the quality of having no practice
[1:22:02] practical
[1:22:02] use it means uselessness so their
[1:22:06] thoughts are actually useless
[1:22:08] that transit they just change there's
[1:22:09] nothing secure there's nothing stable
[1:22:11] about their thought pattern
[1:22:14] this is so paul saying don't be like
[1:22:16] this be steadfast the word is true
[1:22:19] we're going to heaven we're victorious
[1:22:22] the blood has paid it all he's taken all
[1:22:24] our sins away we're walking victory
[1:22:26] everything's going to be fine we're
[1:22:28] going to get there he's going to get us
[1:22:29] there
[1:22:30] that's how we should be just just
[1:22:31] steadfast doesn't matter what comes
[1:22:33] what goes what yo whatever the enemy
[1:22:36] tries to come against us worth
[1:22:38] just keep walking with the lord just
[1:22:40] love him
[1:22:42] amen so he says don't be like that
[1:22:46] as don't walk as other gentiles walk he
[1:22:49] says
[1:22:51] he says let no man deceive you with vain
[1:22:53] words for because of these things cometh
[1:22:56] the wrath of god upon the children of
[1:22:57] disobedience
[1:22:59] said no man deceive you with empty
[1:23:00] things with vain words things that have
[1:23:02] no value that are useless
[1:23:03] that are transient don't don't don't
[1:23:06] don't let anyone deceive you with those
[1:23:08] things
[1:23:09] and be not ye therefore partakers with
[1:23:11] them
[1:23:13] for we were so i've jumped down to
[1:23:16] forgive me i'm now in ephesians 5.
[1:23:19] and 8 for ye were sometimes darkness
[1:23:23] but now are ye light in the lord walk as
[1:23:25] children of light now notice
[1:23:27] he doesn't say sometimes you were in
[1:23:29] darkness but you were darkness
[1:23:31] why is because the spirit that was
[1:23:33] within us before we met the lord was
[1:23:34] darkness
[1:23:35] it was the spirit of this world so we
[1:23:37] were manifesting by the spirit that was
[1:23:39] within us we were manifesting the
[1:23:41] darkness
[1:23:41] that's why we were darkness but now ye
[1:23:44] are light in the lord hallelujah so now
[1:23:46] there's been a transformation take place
[1:23:48] where the devil's been dethroned off the
[1:23:49] throne of your heart the lord has taken
[1:23:51] residence now we are the light in the
[1:23:53] lord
[1:23:54] hallelujah so we were darkness
[1:23:58] but now we're light but he says here
[1:23:59] ephesians 5 and 9 for the fruit of the
[1:24:01] spirit is a new goodness and
[1:24:02] righteousness and truth
[1:24:04] proving what is acceptable unto the lord
[1:24:07] now now we're going back to ephesians 4
[1:24:09] and 18
[1:24:10] having the understanding
[1:24:13] darkened being alienated from the life
[1:24:16] of god
[1:24:17] through the ignorance that is in them
[1:24:19] because of the blindness
[1:24:21] of their heart now it really struck me
[1:24:24] being alienated from the life of god
[1:24:27] this is why they're this way
[1:24:29] it's not from being alienated from the
[1:24:31] teachings of god or from church or from
[1:24:33] doctrine but it's from the life of god
[1:24:35] now this having the understanding that
[1:24:37] that word understanding is there
[1:24:39] is is the person's mind how they think
[1:24:43] um being having the understanding
[1:24:45] darkened so it's there and that word
[1:24:46] darkened means to be made obscure
[1:24:48] so their thinking and how their thought
[1:24:50] pens are are
[1:24:51] obscure they're not clear thoughts the
[1:24:54] only way you can have clear thoughts is
[1:24:55] if you have the mind of christ
[1:24:57] if you have the word of god then you
[1:24:58] thinking clearly but if you don't well
[1:25:00] your brain's real foggy
[1:25:02] we don't want foggy heads we want real
[1:25:04] clear thoughts
[1:25:06] being being alienated from the from the
[1:25:09] life of god now to be alienated it means
[1:25:11] to be a strained away
[1:25:13] that is to be a non-participant so if
[1:25:16] you're not participating in something
[1:25:18] you are alienated from it it's not part
[1:25:21] of you
[1:25:22] you can't identify with it it doesn't
[1:25:24] belong to you
[1:25:25] so if you're alienated from the life of
[1:25:27] god you're not participating in its life
[1:25:30] but if you are not alienated from the
[1:25:33] life of god
[1:25:34] then you are participating in its life
[1:25:35] it's part of you it lives in you
[1:25:37] you feel its effects it changes you it
[1:25:39] moulds you amen but if you're alienated
[1:25:41] from it it doesn't change
[1:25:42] it doesn't it doesn't transform you it
[1:25:44] doesn't affect you i think we never want
[1:25:46] to be in that condition
[1:25:49] it says through the ignorance so are we
[1:25:50] still got thank you verse 18 through the
[1:25:52] ignorance
[1:25:53] that is in them because of the blindness
[1:25:56] now this word blindness
[1:25:57] it means stupidity or callousness
[1:26:01] which is a hardness no emotion so so
[1:26:03] that the blindness is all being hard
[1:26:05] you know having no emotion no response
[1:26:07] just putting up a wall
[1:26:09] and you know a blindness of their hearts
[1:26:12] now their heart means their thoughts or
[1:26:14] their feelings
[1:26:15] so so a person can get to a state where
[1:26:17] they have no feeling towards the lord
[1:26:19] they're callous they won't be changed
[1:26:20] they'll say no you're wrong
[1:26:22] i'm right and sometimes the worst
[1:26:24] callousness is a religious callousness
[1:26:26] where people justify themselves with
[1:26:28] quotes and with scriptures
[1:26:29] and they think they're right but they're
[1:26:30] callous and and you can actually see it
[1:26:33] in someone's life because the life of
[1:26:35] god is not manifesting in their lives
[1:26:37] that's not effectually living you know
[1:26:38] this message is more than quotes
[1:26:40] it's more than stories it's more than
[1:26:42] testimonies it's the life of god
[1:26:44] and that life of god wasn't just a mean
[1:26:45] to be in malachi 4 it's mean to be in
[1:26:47] you and i
[1:26:48] remember the purpose malachi 4 case is
[1:26:50] behold i send you who's you that's me
[1:26:52] elijah the prophet who is that brother
[1:26:53] brown to do what turn my heart
[1:26:55] back to the faith of the pentecostal
[1:26:57] fathers back to the original faith
[1:26:59] and in that original faith god lived he
[1:27:01] changed their natures transformed them
[1:27:02] set them free brought answers hallelujah
[1:27:05] brought stability overcame
[1:27:06] you know for them in their age and
[1:27:08] that's what this message should do
[1:27:09] amen hallelujah
[1:27:14] praise the lord i'm glad you know it's
[1:27:16] like
[1:27:17] john would say in other yeah i think
[1:27:19] it's in first john
[1:27:21] that we've seen wait let's just turn to
[1:27:24] that i don't
[1:27:24] um i said i don't have it on my
[1:27:26] slideshow but i don't even have a
[1:27:27] slideshow so
[1:27:31] he says in first john 1 1 that which was
[1:27:33] from the beginning
[1:27:35] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:27:37] with our eyes
[1:27:39] which we have looked upon and our hands
[1:27:42] have handled of the word of life
[1:27:46] for the life was manifested and we have
[1:27:47] seen it and bear witness and shown to
[1:27:49] you that eternal life
[1:27:51] which was with the father and was
[1:27:53] manifested
[1:27:54] unto us now if something's manifested to
[1:27:57] you it changes your life
[1:27:59] so john now john would actually come
[1:28:01] from a position here
[1:28:02] it's not just a second hand experience
[1:28:05] but that word of life
[1:28:07] hallelujah that life of god was
[1:28:10] manifested unto him
[1:28:11] and now he wants to share it with them
[1:28:13] it became a personal
[1:28:15] thing with him hallelujah so if
[1:28:18] something becomes personal in that way
[1:28:19] you're not alienated from it
[1:28:22] you're not a strained away now we're
[1:28:24] back to ephesians 4 and 19. but
[1:28:26] i'm you know i love those words of john
[1:28:28] because i can put myself there
[1:28:30] that life that was with the father has
[1:28:32] been manifested unto me
[1:28:34] hallelujah god's own life amen
[1:28:37] now um ephesians 4 and 19 we're back
[1:28:39] there who being
[1:28:40] who being past feeling which which being
[1:28:44] past feeling means they become
[1:28:45] apathetic that's how that their past
[1:28:48] feeling they don't really care about
[1:28:49] they become indifferent
[1:28:51] having given themselves over to
[1:28:52] lasciviousness to work
[1:28:54] all uncleanness with grittiness so
[1:28:58] so people who are past feeling they're
[1:29:00] not enthusiastic they're not passionate
[1:29:03] they're not on fire they just become
[1:29:04] indifferent to it all well years ago god
[1:29:07] did this but i guess well i've just got
[1:29:08] a
[1:29:09] you know i've got to simmer down and
[1:29:10] i've just got to you know because i've
[1:29:11] got responsibilities now and you know
[1:29:13] things are different no no
[1:29:14] god's not different god's the same so
[1:29:16] the fire we come in with is the fire we
[1:29:18] should still have
[1:29:19] the first love we started with let's
[1:29:21] continue on to that first love
[1:29:23] hallelujah that's how i feel about it
[1:29:24] amen so even though we have cares and
[1:29:26] responsibilities it doesn't mean we can
[1:29:28] be a victorious christian
[1:29:30] amen because even though we have
[1:29:31] responsibilities you know who cares
[1:29:33] we should still be able to rejoice in
[1:29:35] the lord
[1:29:36] hallelujah so now let's notice he says
[1:29:39] they turn themselves over
[1:29:40] unto lasciviousness and then jude would
[1:29:43] so so these are
[1:29:44] these are pagan people but it's amazing
[1:29:46] because in jude jude warns against
[1:29:48] ungodly men having turned the grace of
[1:29:50] our god until
[1:29:51] sorry i'm sorry ephesians 4 19 have
[1:29:54] given themselves over to lasciviousness
[1:29:56] i'm not sure if i said that right
[1:29:57] to work all uncleanness with greediness
[1:30:00] and then
[1:30:00] and then jude warns about ungodly men
[1:30:03] turning the grace of our god
[1:30:04] into lasciviousness so the pagans had
[1:30:07] this lasciviousness now there's a people
[1:30:09] coming among the believers that have
[1:30:11] turned the grace of god into the same
[1:30:12] thing
[1:30:14] denying the only lord god and our lord
[1:30:16] jesus christ but he says but ye have not
[1:30:18] so learned christ if so be that ye have
[1:30:21] heard him and have been taught by him as
[1:30:22] the truth is in jesus
[1:30:24] that ye put off concerning the former
[1:30:26] conversation the manner of life the old
[1:30:28] man
[1:30:29] which is corrupt according to the
[1:30:30] deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[1:30:32] spirit of your mind
[1:30:34] and that ye put on the new man after
[1:30:36] which god is created in righteousness
[1:30:38] and true holiness
[1:30:39] having the understanding hallelujah
[1:30:42] i mean so we're called to put on the new
[1:30:45] man so i had another um
[1:30:47] i i don't know what happens with my
[1:30:50] notes sometimes
[1:30:50] but you know he calls us to put on the
[1:30:52] new man we have to put off the old man
[1:30:54] we're walking in units of life amen so
[1:30:57] now the question is
[1:30:58] if the result of being alienated from
[1:31:00] the life of god would result in someone
[1:31:03] who
[1:31:03] is past feeling they don't care they're
[1:31:05] indifferent they're you know they become
[1:31:07] callous they're not
[1:31:08] you know they have no enthusiasm no fire
[1:31:10] no passion
[1:31:11] then what would result from being one
[1:31:14] with god
[1:31:15] so someone who's not alienated from the
[1:31:17] life of god but now they are
[1:31:19] in the life of god i mean so we are not
[1:31:22] now so now the believer is not a
[1:31:23] strained
[1:31:24] they are not a non-participant but he is
[1:31:27] active in the everyday life
[1:31:29] he is living in their lives manifesting
[1:31:31] his word hallelujah because you know if
[1:31:34] you know if if he is participating in my
[1:31:36] life and he is my life
[1:31:38] then he'll produce his life amen says no
[1:31:40] so so therefore
[1:31:42] i cannot become hardened i cannot become
[1:31:44] calloused
[1:31:45] right even though the devil will try and
[1:31:46] make us that way because he wants us
[1:31:48] you know the devil wants us to become
[1:31:50] ineffective
[1:31:52] he doesn't matter how much church we go
[1:31:54] to how much quotes we quote
[1:31:55] if the life of god is not living
[1:31:58] that is the thing that really shakes the
[1:32:00] devil when god puts on flesh he hates it
[1:32:03] god loves putting on flesh he loves
[1:32:06] being in his believers the devil hates
[1:32:08] god putting on flesh
[1:32:10] hallelujah so we don't want to ever
[1:32:13] shrink back and just just go through the
[1:32:15] motions
[1:32:17] i mean the move is on my lord the move
[1:32:19] is on
[1:32:20] holly god should live we should give him
[1:32:22] free course
[1:32:24] amen now this may be a segue but what
[1:32:27] does a new birth do
[1:32:28] sorry if this is like two sermons in one
[1:32:30] but here we are what is the new birthday
[1:32:32] remember we want to bypass this net
[1:32:34] because this net's over the world it's
[1:32:36] working it works really well
[1:32:39] it does its job people are getting
[1:32:40] they're multi look at the tech companies
[1:32:43] you know that are being made fat
[1:32:46] according to bible language because of
[1:32:48] this net
[1:32:49] multi-billion dollar company some of the
[1:32:51] biggest companies in the world and they
[1:32:52] physically don't really do
[1:32:54] much but it's all data
[1:32:57] amen or you know data understanding you
[1:32:59] and what
[1:33:00] what is it designed to do work out you
[1:33:02] so it can make you buy stuff
[1:33:04] or make you spend time you know
[1:33:06] knowledge is power and it's so true in
[1:33:08] this day
[1:33:09] amen so what does a new birth do it
[1:33:11] makes us new creatures in christ
[1:33:13] so the old man's dead we're now a new
[1:33:15] creature i mean it
[1:33:17] it produces god's own life in us it is
[1:33:20] the word being made manifested
[1:33:22] amen so what so what christ did the
[1:33:25] bride will do because his life is in the
[1:33:27] bride
[1:33:28] when when jesus was saying john 14 12
[1:33:31] verily verily i say unto you
[1:33:32] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:33:34] do shall he do also
[1:33:36] and greater works than these shall he do
[1:33:38] because i go unto my father
[1:33:39] now so he said he that believeth on me
[1:33:41] the works that i do he shall do also
[1:33:43] i mean so if you see the works of god
[1:33:45] that he did in your life you're on a
[1:33:46] good road
[1:33:49] no people say well what about the false
[1:33:50] anointed ones well you know
[1:33:52] the bride has to be anointed too there's
[1:33:55] not just one class of anointed one at
[1:33:56] the end time
[1:33:57] it's not just the false remember the the
[1:33:59] spirit or the rain you know how paul
[1:34:01] would speak about the wheat and the
[1:34:02] tears in the field
[1:34:04] the rain was never for the tear never
[1:34:06] ever it was for the wheat
[1:34:08] right so the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:34:10] was never for the anointed one i mean
[1:34:11] the false anointed one
[1:34:13] out there the anointing of the holy
[1:34:14] ghost is for the bride
[1:34:16] it's for us so just be just because they
[1:34:18] do what they do it shouldn't diminish oh
[1:34:20] we better not let that happen here oh
[1:34:22] it's god moving there we say well
[1:34:23] it's not for the tears it's for the
[1:34:25] wheat
[1:34:27] so we don't want to push those things
[1:34:28] away
[1:34:31] is everyone following me should i say
[1:34:32] i'm about to close and we'll wake up and
[1:34:34] here we are you know
[1:34:37] brother brahm says and is this a sign of
[1:34:38] the answer when he takes scofield's uh
[1:34:41] list of mysteries that be unfolded then
[1:34:42] he added
[1:34:43] um adds to them he says the mystery of
[1:34:45] the baptism of the holy ghost without
[1:34:47] sensation and many people put a full
[1:34:49] stop there but there's a comma
[1:34:50] but the person of christ performing in
[1:34:52] you the same works that he did
[1:34:54] amen so you may not you so so all that's
[1:34:56] why all of our testimonies may be
[1:34:58] different
[1:34:58] but you'll see the works of christ in
[1:35:00] you i mean because that is the mystery
[1:35:02] is now god coming into a person and
[1:35:04] living his life out
[1:35:06] i mean it's the person of christ
[1:35:08] performing in you the same works that he
[1:35:09] did well
[1:35:10] now the question is well what works did
[1:35:12] he did he overcame
[1:35:14] he overcame the religious system he
[1:35:16] overcame the
[1:35:17] the social pressures he overcame family
[1:35:20] pressure
[1:35:20] remember his your family he was he was
[1:35:22] in a house preaching and his family's
[1:35:24] outside his
[1:35:25] your mother and and your brethren are
[1:35:26] calling for you to come out calling to
[1:35:28] see you
[1:35:29] he says who is my mother my brethren all
[1:35:30] that do the will of god
[1:35:32] right so so he went beyond family
[1:35:34] pressure cultural pressure religious
[1:35:36] pressure
[1:35:36] i mean he overcame hell death and the
[1:35:38] grave he overcame all things
[1:35:41] hallelujah so if jesus overcame and and
[1:35:43] that same person is in you then you'll
[1:35:45] overcome this world
[1:35:46] you'll overcome the challenges and the
[1:35:48] precious pressures of this age you will
[1:35:50] overcome
[1:35:51] because he overcame and he can't change
[1:35:53] so if he ever came back there he'll
[1:35:54] overcome here and he'll overcome in the
[1:35:56] future that's just
[1:35:57] that's just what he does hallelujah he's
[1:36:00] a creature of habit too you know just
[1:36:01] like the devil but he's a creature of
[1:36:03] habit too he ever came there and he
[1:36:04] cannot change
[1:36:05] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:06] forever amen so if he will overcome
[1:36:10] if he ever came back there he has to
[1:36:11] overcome today and you and i
[1:36:13] if that same spirit is in you amen that
[1:36:16] doesn't mean we won't be tested or tried
[1:36:18] or even stand on a landmine
[1:36:21] but he's the healer he'll restore and
[1:36:23] many times sometimes we're going to go
[1:36:25] through something to warn someone not to
[1:36:26] step on that same mind
[1:36:29] well that's not very fair well god just
[1:36:31] has happens to ordain a plan that
[1:36:33] there's a power in the testimony
[1:36:35] and there's a real big power of a
[1:36:36] testimony being delivered from something
[1:36:38] and that's the reason why we actually
[1:36:40] god doesn't erase our memory of our old
[1:36:42] past or where we fall in sin
[1:36:44] is because he actually keeps it allows
[1:36:45] it there that we'll be thankful
[1:36:47] they were not that person anymore
[1:36:49] hallelujah that when you see someone
[1:36:50] about to stand on that mind
[1:36:52] you can you can tackle them off it well
[1:36:54] that's a bit radical well
[1:36:56] i'd rather do that then you go boof up
[1:36:58] and smoke
[1:37:00] well what well how does that exactly
[1:37:02] work you know the woman you know god
[1:37:04] tailors his people
[1:37:05] that when other seed is going to come in
[1:37:08] that they
[1:37:09] people have a testimony that are in that
[1:37:10] can actually step into the person of a
[1:37:12] burden who's actually in that transition
[1:37:14] from coming from darkness to light
[1:37:15] you take the woman at the well she had a
[1:37:17] powerful testimony not because she saw
[1:37:19] oh
[1:37:20] not not just because she said we know
[1:37:21] where messiah cometh he'll do these
[1:37:23] things
[1:37:23] but because now she came out of that
[1:37:25] life because there would have been other
[1:37:26] women at the well
[1:37:28] that would have been in the same
[1:37:29] predicament that would have come to
[1:37:30] christ as well
[1:37:31] but she could enter into the burden of
[1:37:34] them because she had just what she had
[1:37:35] stepped on that mine
[1:37:37] but now she had been healed from that
[1:37:39] explosion and now she could take them to
[1:37:41] the healer she could intercede on their
[1:37:43] behalf
[1:37:44] you following me right that they could
[1:37:46] but but peter and the apostles they had
[1:37:48] never been the woman at the well
[1:37:50] so they could sympathize but they
[1:37:53] couldn't enter into that burden like she
[1:37:54] could
[1:37:56] that's why never ever let the devil use
[1:37:58] your past against you there's power in
[1:38:00] that past
[1:38:01] god wants to use it to shake the kingdom
[1:38:03] of hell
[1:38:04] hallelujah just like in the old
[1:38:05] testament there was you know there were
[1:38:07] six
[1:38:08] cities of refuge and a lot of them were
[1:38:10] built they were actually used to be
[1:38:12] philistine or amalekite or whatever
[1:38:13] right garrisons
[1:38:15] you know it was enemy cities then israel
[1:38:17] came in
[1:38:18] cleared them out it became a city of
[1:38:19] refuge so before we meet the lord there
[1:38:21] might be a complex or a pain or a hurt
[1:38:23] where the devil actually is in residence
[1:38:25] in our life
[1:38:25] because of something we went through
[1:38:27] before we meet the lord but then when
[1:38:28] god comes in
[1:38:29] he clears out the devil he takes up
[1:38:31] residence now he wants to use that
[1:38:34] not to hold it against us never never
[1:38:36] never does he hold our past against us
[1:38:38] aren't you glad hello he never he never
[1:38:40] blackmails us uses the leverage that's
[1:38:42] not how god works
[1:38:44] but now that things in our life now can
[1:38:46] become a city of refuge to someone else
[1:38:49] well how is it a refuge they come to you
[1:38:50] and you can just say
[1:38:52] i've been there i used to have that and
[1:38:54] you can enter in
[1:38:56] that's why you know maybe i repeat
[1:38:59] myself too much but i can
[1:39:00] i can speak about being a gamer i can
[1:39:03] speak about being into music
[1:39:06] movies all kinds of things but i know
[1:39:09] that was a garrison in my life
[1:39:11] pornography all those different things
[1:39:12] that was the garrison of the devil in my
[1:39:14] life but now i've been freed and so now
[1:39:16] i can enter into a bird and say don't go
[1:39:18] there
[1:39:19] it's really not worth it it's really not
[1:39:21] worth it it's not worth the time it's
[1:39:22] not worth the pain
[1:39:24] you know don't stand on that mind what
[1:39:26] and it
[1:39:27] you know if you've stood on that mind
[1:39:28] i'll say there is a healer in the house
[1:39:30] today
[1:39:31] that can put your leg back on that you
[1:39:32] can walk with god
[1:39:34] hallelujah amen jesus said to him that
[1:39:38] overcometh
[1:39:39] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:39:41] even as i also overcame
[1:39:43] and have set down with my father and his
[1:39:44] throne it's amazing when
[1:39:46] when you read in the book of hebrews i
[1:39:48] just been thinking of this one verse
[1:39:51] or the first part of this verse hebrews
[1:39:52] 11 33
[1:39:54] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[1:39:58] so the faith they had um that word
[1:40:01] subdued means to overcome
[1:40:03] so the faith they had caused him to
[1:40:05] overcome kingdoms
[1:40:06] he said well how did you know give me an
[1:40:08] example
[1:40:10] moses through faith subdued egypt
[1:40:14] he went into the superpower of the day
[1:40:16] and his faith remember here's egypt they
[1:40:18] have their pharaoh they have their
[1:40:20] royalty they have their court they have
[1:40:21] their systems they've got their
[1:40:22] government
[1:40:23] they've got their all their all this all
[1:40:25] their system of
[1:40:27] of their nation is there it's not a
[1:40:29] haphazard thing it's an incredible force
[1:40:31] and they've got their armies and their
[1:40:33] spares and everything and here's one man
[1:40:35] 80 years old with a stick in his hand
[1:40:37] but there's a faith there's a revelation
[1:40:38] in his heart amen that's going to subdue
[1:40:41] this egypt and it's going to release the
[1:40:42] people of israel out of
[1:40:44] out of that country so his faith subdued
[1:40:47] a kingdom
[1:40:48] that's incredible faith hallelujah
[1:40:50] that's not just a i hope so no he had a
[1:40:52] revelation in his heart
[1:40:53] you go down there and you get those
[1:40:54] people out hallelujah and pharaoh said
[1:40:57] no but moses says you're going to say
[1:40:58] yes
[1:41:00] and it would no back and forth no but
[1:41:01] then god just kept plaguing that place
[1:41:03] because it was moses faith subdued
[1:41:05] overcame hallelujah so it's the same
[1:41:07] thing with you and i
[1:41:08] now we know we're not fighting a natural
[1:41:11] enemy
[1:41:12] we're not here to go subdue egypt again
[1:41:15] but we wrestle against flesh and
[1:41:17] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:41:19] principalities against powers against
[1:41:20] the rulers of darkness of this world
[1:41:22] against spiritual wickedness and high
[1:41:24] places now
[1:41:25] to me you know hell is a kingdom
[1:41:29] it's a dominion it's a domain of the
[1:41:31] devil and his angels and there's
[1:41:32] different hierarchies of fallen angels
[1:41:34] whatever more
[1:41:35] but if moses through faith can subdue a
[1:41:37] natural kingdom
[1:41:38] under the blood of bulls and goats now
[1:41:40] how much more people
[1:41:41] under the blood of jesus christ can
[1:41:44] subdue
[1:41:45] the forces of hell they can wrestle with
[1:41:47] hell and overcome
[1:41:48] why because their chief captain has
[1:41:50] already done the job but he says now
[1:41:52] i've won the victory but now i'm going
[1:41:53] to manifest that victory through you
[1:41:55] however i want you to enjoy the victory
[1:41:57] that i won for you
[1:41:58] amen so faith can subdue a kingdom faith
[1:42:01] cancer due to forces of health
[1:42:03] faith can subdue every demon power can
[1:42:05] wrestle and overcome it
[1:42:06] doesn't matter how big the trouble may
[1:42:08] be going through the faith that we have
[1:42:11] will subdue it will overcome it remember
[1:42:13] the apostle paul said that with the life
[1:42:15] i
[1:42:16] now live i live by the faith of the son
[1:42:18] of god he didn't say faith in the son of
[1:42:20] god but by the faith of the son of god
[1:42:22] so the life he was living it wasn't
[1:42:24] paul's faith
[1:42:25] that was he living by it was actually
[1:42:27] the faith of god himself was in paul
[1:42:29] and that was the life he was living he
[1:42:31] was living by that faith
[1:42:32] hallelujah so now you think about god's
[1:42:34] faith let there be
[1:42:37] and there was hallelujah and then that
[1:42:40] and that same faith prophesied the seed
[1:42:42] of the woman's going to
[1:42:43] crush the head of the seed of the
[1:42:44] serpent and it happened and that same
[1:42:47] faith said there's going to be a new
[1:42:48] hemis and a new earth
[1:42:49] other than that same faith said there's
[1:42:51] going to be a bribe without spot or
[1:42:52] wrinkle
[1:42:53] and that same faith said no man taketh
[1:42:56] my life
[1:42:57] i lie it down i'll raise it back up
[1:42:58] again hallelujah that same faith went to
[1:43:02] calvary with one scripture
[1:43:04] and with that one scripture it came out
[1:43:06] of the grave what is that scripture
[1:43:08] i'll not suffer thy holy one to see
[1:43:09] corruption
[1:43:11] so here's a man had a revelation in his
[1:43:13] heart this body can't rot
[1:43:16] i'm going to come out hallelujah that
[1:43:18] same faith is in you and i
[1:43:20] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:23] that's why we should never limit our
[1:43:25] faith just just let it have its free
[1:43:27] course
[1:43:28] let it live hallelujah amen
[1:43:34] first john 5 and 4 for whatsoever is
[1:43:37] born of god overcometh the world
[1:43:39] hello sons and daughters of god they've
[1:43:41] been born by the holy ghost being born
[1:43:43] by the word
[1:43:44] amen whereas children they overcome the
[1:43:46] world
[1:43:48] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:43:50] the world even
[1:43:51] our faith hallelujah so now we already
[1:43:54] have within us that which we need to
[1:43:56] overcome the world
[1:43:58] amen hallelujah say well the battle is
[1:44:00] pretty bad but we've got the weapon
[1:44:02] are the devils on every side we'll just
[1:44:04] start killing one at a time it may take
[1:44:06] all day but hey let it take all day
[1:44:08] i mean samson killed one philistine at a
[1:44:11] time
[1:44:12] one to a thousand years killed shamga
[1:44:14] kill one at a time fullest thing
[1:44:15] hallelujah
[1:44:16] the mighty men they killed one at a time
[1:44:18] oh there's a lot of devils in my life
[1:44:20] and my family just kill one
[1:44:22] at a time i'll leave the same faith that
[1:44:24] dropped the first one we'll drop the
[1:44:25] second one or drop the third one
[1:44:27] just keep chopping with the word
[1:44:29] hallelujah but don't stop until they're
[1:44:31] all dead
[1:44:34] hallelujah never ever call the truth
[1:44:37] truce with the devil he can wave his
[1:44:41] white flag
[1:44:42] ah no no we're not taking prisoners
[1:44:44] we're showing no quarter
[1:44:46] this is on amen so what we have see
[1:44:49] the victory that overcometh the world is
[1:44:52] even our faith this is what we overcome
[1:44:54] with
[1:44:55] hallelujah and it says in revelations 12
[1:44:57] 11 and they overcame him the devil by
[1:44:59] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:45:00] their testimony
[1:45:01] and their love not their lives unto the
[1:45:03] death amen so this is how we're going to
[1:45:05] overcome so this
[1:45:06] this net you say well it's a very
[1:45:09] dangerous thing sure it is a dangerous
[1:45:11] thing but we have a faith
[1:45:14] that can break its hold you know we know
[1:45:16] that spirits travel on words
[1:45:18] just like i i pray even now that when
[1:45:20] i'm speaking to you it's not my human
[1:45:22] spirit traveling to you
[1:45:23] it's the holy ghost right so so just as
[1:45:26] just as the you know the spirit of god
[1:45:28] will travel on words
[1:45:30] so will a demon power travel on words
[1:45:32] but now it's not just words it's in
[1:45:34] pictures
[1:45:35] it's in videos right so now it actually
[1:45:37] brings a spirit upon people
[1:45:40] that their lives change but we have the
[1:45:43] ability to actually break that spirit
[1:45:44] off someone
[1:45:46] i mean our faith will move it off
[1:45:48] remember there were slave masters that
[1:45:50] were that were beating down the children
[1:45:52] of israel
[1:45:52] moses faith kicked them off hallelujah
[1:45:55] actually caused him to be free of it
[1:45:56] amen so we have the same
[1:45:58] faith that can deliver hallelujah
[1:46:05] amen no no we're still asking the
[1:46:07] question what does the new birth do
[1:46:09] now abraham's journey types the
[1:46:12] believer's journey now i
[1:46:13] just want to say this first the new
[1:46:15] birth will produce the promise of the
[1:46:17] age
[1:46:19] it will it has to every every down
[1:46:22] through the bible people who say were
[1:46:23] born again either
[1:46:25] as a shadow in reality it produced a
[1:46:27] promise of that age
[1:46:29] i just want to take out all the fear of
[1:46:31] if i'm going to make the rapture or not
[1:46:32] i just want to i love to just get rid of
[1:46:34] that thing
[1:46:35] because there's always a wonder i know
[1:46:36] he saved me i know all my sins are gone
[1:46:38] but
[1:46:38] am i going to get there well remember
[1:46:41] the word of the age
[1:46:42] brings the promise of the age and if
[1:46:45] you're born by that word
[1:46:46] then the promise the age is going to
[1:46:47] happen now abraham
[1:46:50] the the promise of his age is he is
[1:46:52] going to have the promised son
[1:46:53] that was his promise that was the
[1:46:54] promise for the age
[1:46:56] and abraham's journey is a type of our
[1:46:59] journey
[1:47:00] there are three states we know there's
[1:47:02] three stages or works of grace that make
[1:47:04] up the new birth
[1:47:05] there's the water the blood and the
[1:47:06] spirit the life now abraham
[1:47:10] had had three stages of his journey now
[1:47:13] brother brown types this
[1:47:15] now sorry if i'm hopefully this will
[1:47:16] just all come together but
[1:47:18] brother brown types the new birth like a
[1:47:21] man
[1:47:22] finding a glass and a manure pile so
[1:47:25] just say if this was a glass
[1:47:26] and it's down in a manure pile this is
[1:47:29] how we were down in the world
[1:47:30] covered in dirt now that glass can't
[1:47:33] help itself
[1:47:34] it may know it's out of place because
[1:47:36] it's meant to be on a table
[1:47:38] being used but it's out of place but it
[1:47:40] takes someone who's greater than the
[1:47:42] glass
[1:47:42] to reach down and pick it up that's
[1:47:44] where god we call out to god because
[1:47:46] god's looking for us
[1:47:47] he said lord help me save me then he
[1:47:50] reaches down
[1:47:51] and picks us up out of the manure pile
[1:47:54] hallelujah isn't that wasn't it
[1:47:55] wonderful when that happened
[1:47:56] you're stuck in this mud how do i get
[1:47:57] out of this thing he just reaches down
[1:47:59] his hand and picks you up
[1:48:00] hallelujah but now but now the reason
[1:48:03] that the glass got picked up is because
[1:48:05] the one who wants to use it sees the
[1:48:06] purpose in the glass
[1:48:08] so he saw a purpose in you you're his
[1:48:11] bride
[1:48:11] that's why he picked you up out of the
[1:48:13] dirt of this world hallelujah
[1:48:15] but then yet i can't drink out of this
[1:48:17] because it's covered in manure
[1:48:18] so now that's so that's justification
[1:48:20] but now it's got to be sanctified
[1:48:22] cleansed and set apart for service so
[1:48:24] i take it and i wash it so abraham was
[1:48:27] called out of the land of er
[1:48:28] it's like god picking up the glass out
[1:48:30] of the manure but then he had to be
[1:48:32] sanctified just like the glass has to be
[1:48:34] cleansed
[1:48:35] and set aside for service so now
[1:48:37] abraham's sanctification came when lot
[1:48:39] was separated from him
[1:48:41] he was sanctified but so now i can take
[1:48:44] this glass i can i can
[1:48:45] i can cleanse i can take all the dirt
[1:48:47] off it and i can sit it there but now
[1:48:49] it's not in use yet
[1:48:52] but now with abraham and sarah the new
[1:48:55] birth in their lives was
[1:48:56] was represented by a change of their
[1:48:58] name
[1:49:00] now when because abram became abraham
[1:49:03] sarah sarah became sarah now the
[1:49:06] now the word i mean i mean abraham or
[1:49:09] abram
[1:49:10] if you look at the spelling there's an h
[1:49:12] that's put into sarah and abraham's name
[1:49:14] to became abraham and sarah
[1:49:16] now in the hebrew that that h represents
[1:49:18] the breath of god
[1:49:20] so what god is saying he had to breathe
[1:49:22] into them
[1:49:23] that they'd become new creatures that
[1:49:25] they could bring forth the promised son
[1:49:27] now jesus would jesus would would
[1:49:29] breathe on his disciples after his
[1:49:31] resurrection
[1:49:32] he breathed of them and said unto them
[1:49:34] receive ye the holy ghost
[1:49:35] but now that breath only came into them
[1:49:37] on the day of pentecost
[1:49:40] amen so so they had to be so so that
[1:49:42] breath
[1:49:43] or i say their names being changed
[1:49:45] they're represented or showed them
[1:49:47] receiving the holy ghost that was the
[1:49:48] third stage
[1:49:49] so now they weren't just cleansed and
[1:49:51] set apart for service but now they are
[1:49:52] filled
[1:49:54] that now the promise that was theirs
[1:49:56] would be manifested
[1:49:57] what was that promise they would receive
[1:49:58] isaac they'd receive the promised son
[1:50:02] because remember sarah herself had to
[1:50:04] receive faith had to receive a
[1:50:05] revelation
[1:50:06] that she could have the child as it says
[1:50:08] in in
[1:50:09] hebrews 11 11 through faith also sarah
[1:50:12] herself
[1:50:13] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:50:15] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:50:17] past
[1:50:17] age because she judged him faithful who
[1:50:20] had promised
[1:50:21] so beforehand she didn't judge him
[1:50:23] faithful because it wasn't her
[1:50:24] experience
[1:50:25] but after she met the lord there in
[1:50:27] genesis 18 with lord came down in a body
[1:50:29] of flesh discerned her heart
[1:50:30] then she realized because that was her
[1:50:32] visitation then she judged him faithful
[1:50:36] and the and and because she judged him
[1:50:38] faithful then she received the promise
[1:50:40] now have you judged him faithful have
[1:50:43] you judged the lord faithful
[1:50:44] lord you're able to fulfill your word
[1:50:46] for me not just for someone else not
[1:50:48] just for the preacher for whoever
[1:50:50] but for me you're able to fulfill your
[1:50:52] word and my life
[1:50:54] i judge you faithful you can do what i
[1:50:56] think is impossible you're more than
[1:50:58] able to do it
[1:50:58] there's no problem too hard nothing too
[1:51:00] difficult god can do it
[1:51:03] amen but you've just got to judge him
[1:51:04] faithful
[1:51:06] hallelujah now all this was done that
[1:51:08] they would receive the promise on isaac
[1:51:10] which was
[1:51:11] the promise for their age so i so i made
[1:51:13] the same before the new birth
[1:51:15] producers will produce the promise of
[1:51:17] the age now what is the promise of this
[1:51:19] age the body change
[1:51:21] that is the rapture so if you're truly
[1:51:23] born again
[1:51:25] you're going in a rapture if you truly
[1:51:27] are born again because remember
[1:51:30] the apostle paul said grieve you not the
[1:51:32] holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed
[1:51:34] into the day of redemption
[1:51:35] i mean so if you're truly sealed in
[1:51:38] holly you've really got the new birth
[1:51:40] you can't miss it
[1:51:43] there just goes a whole bunch of fear
[1:51:46] kick it out the window
[1:51:48] don't worry just press on with god just
[1:51:51] love him and walk with him everything
[1:51:52] will turn out all right
[1:51:54] whoa but brother braham said that you
[1:51:56] can receive the baptism of the holy
[1:51:58] ghost every day and still go to hell
[1:52:00] what's he talking about he's talking
[1:52:01] about an anointing on your spirit
[1:52:04] and that's true but god can come and
[1:52:06] dwell in your soul
[1:52:08] you're sealed in hallelujah well how do
[1:52:12] i know i have it what do you see his
[1:52:13] word put on flesh
[1:52:15] i mean when when the apostle paul or
[1:52:18] peter speaks about the fruits of the
[1:52:19] spirit
[1:52:20] and says how a believer should be and
[1:52:22] you just see that your life is actually
[1:52:23] living there before you read it
[1:52:26] hallelujah well what's going on the
[1:52:27] spirit in you bears witness with his
[1:52:30] right your spirit bears what the best
[1:52:32] witness with his that you are a son or
[1:52:34] daughter of god
[1:52:35] why because when you read in the word
[1:52:36] how believers should be say i'm living
[1:52:38] that
[1:52:38] amen who told you to be that way what he
[1:52:41] did
[1:52:42] because it's not a mental remembering
[1:52:44] what the fruits of the spirit are then
[1:52:45] trying to conform your life to
[1:52:47] match that it's not that at all it says
[1:52:49] that god comes in to manifest that life
[1:52:51] out of you
[1:52:52] hallelujah amen
[1:52:56] now the whole church is built upon
[1:52:58] revelation
[1:53:00] the whole church now i heard brother
[1:53:01] aaron mcgeary say this a while ago but
[1:53:03] he said you when when jesus
[1:53:05] spoke to the disciples and he you know
[1:53:08] your and and simon peter said thou art
[1:53:10] the christ the son of the living god
[1:53:12] and then jesus would say thou art peter
[1:53:15] and upon this rock i'll build my
[1:53:16] churches blessed thou simon by jonah
[1:53:18] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:53:20] this unto thee but my father which is in
[1:53:21] heaven
[1:53:22] and that and i said to thee thou art
[1:53:24] peter and upon this rock i'll build my
[1:53:26] church
[1:53:26] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:53:28] against it we know that that
[1:53:30] that rock is the revelation of who jesus
[1:53:32] christ is
[1:53:33] and and brother aaron mcgarry said
[1:53:34] basically all of paul's epistles just
[1:53:36] are just expounding upon that one
[1:53:38] thought
[1:53:41] amen and so the whole
[1:53:44] church is built upon revelation when god
[1:53:47] reveals something to you
[1:53:49] you should always treasure that very
[1:53:51] very very highly
[1:53:52] brother it says in the rapture see but
[1:53:54] to the church the bride the rapture is a
[1:53:55] revelation to her
[1:53:57] it's revealed to her that the revelation
[1:53:59] the true bride of christ
[1:54:01] will be waiting for that revelation of
[1:54:02] the rapture now it is a revelation
[1:54:04] for the revelation is faith you cannot
[1:54:07] have a revelation without it being faith
[1:54:09] faith is a revelation because it's
[1:54:11] something that's revealed to you faith
[1:54:12] is a revelation
[1:54:14] faith is something that's been revealed
[1:54:15] to you like it was to abraham
[1:54:17] that could call anything contrary to
[1:54:19] what had been revealed to him
[1:54:22] as though it wasn't so now faith that's
[1:54:24] what faith is is the revelation of god
[1:54:27] the church is built upon a revelation
[1:54:29] their whole entire body
[1:54:31] amen you know we read this
[1:54:36] there's a there's a um everyone knows
[1:54:38] the scripture
[1:54:39] for we walk by faith and not by sight we
[1:54:42] all know that scripture don't we
[1:54:43] now this does i hope tie into what i
[1:54:45] have been saying you know you may think
[1:54:47] we're doing this but hopefully we're
[1:54:48] doing kind of this
[1:54:49] but you know because paul told us in the
[1:54:52] beginning we read
[1:54:53] we need to walk circumspectly so how we
[1:54:56] walk
[1:54:56] and but that walk is by faith and not by
[1:54:58] sight now
[1:55:00] it's amazing well to me it was really
[1:55:02] neat when i was looking into the
[1:55:03] scripture because
[1:55:04] paul is tying a walk by faith with the
[1:55:07] revelation that you have an eternal body
[1:55:09] in the heavens already
[1:55:10] because he would begin that chapter and
[1:55:12] say that we know that if our earthly
[1:55:14] house of this tabernacle were dissolved
[1:55:16] we have a building of god a house not
[1:55:18] made with hands eternal
[1:55:20] in the heavens so he's tying in this
[1:55:22] because he's telling the believers this
[1:55:24] is really what's what's pushing you
[1:55:25] along
[1:55:26] this is why you groan you know i was
[1:55:28] thinking imagine being one of the
[1:55:30] believers in corinth before this letter
[1:55:31] came
[1:55:32] you know having such a desire to go to
[1:55:34] heaven but not really being able to give
[1:55:37] the reason that's causing it
[1:55:39] because you know we all grow we all want
[1:55:40] to go you know and you know maybe you
[1:55:42] could ask that person is it because the
[1:55:44] world's evil
[1:55:45] well yeah maybe because it's the world's
[1:55:46] evil but you know when i get to church
[1:55:48] or i get to a convention the prince of
[1:55:50] the lord comes or maybe i'm praying at
[1:55:51] home and the lord just comes real close
[1:55:53] there's still such a groaning and desire
[1:55:55] to go to be to hear you go to bed you
[1:55:57] know go to be with the lord so it's not
[1:55:58] because the world's evil necessarily
[1:56:00] but there's a hunger but you can't put
[1:56:02] your foot on what that hunger really is
[1:56:05] you know well it might just because you
[1:56:07] see the lord you know you want to see
[1:56:08] the lord jesus and you're feeling really
[1:56:10] happy well no
[1:56:11] that you know that may be true but you
[1:56:13] know sometimes that desire that hunger
[1:56:16] is still there
[1:56:16] even if i'm not happy it's just beyond
[1:56:18] emotion
[1:56:20] but then the apostle paul would write
[1:56:21] this letter and say the reason you grow
[1:56:23] and the reason you have this desire
[1:56:25] i mean it's because you have an eternal
[1:56:27] body waiting in the heavens already and
[1:56:29] that is that theophany is actually
[1:56:30] calling you
[1:56:31] that's why you have a hunger and a
[1:56:32] thirst because you've got a body calling
[1:56:34] for you to come up higher
[1:56:36] hallelujah wouldn't that give you such
[1:56:37] stability because you've got this
[1:56:39] something you can't express
[1:56:41] i've got this desire i really want to go
[1:56:42] i want to be you know but i'm not sure
[1:56:44] exactly there's so many different
[1:56:46] factors which may bring the answer but
[1:56:47] really the whole answer is that you've
[1:56:49] got a body calling you
[1:56:51] hallelujah and that's why brother rahm
[1:56:53] said when you recognize this message
[1:56:55] with eagle food you heard from your
[1:56:56] theophany
[1:56:57] hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:57:01] he says he says if be so that being
[1:57:03] clothed we shall not be found naked
[1:57:05] for we that are in this tabernacle do
[1:57:06] groan speaking of these bodies being
[1:57:08] burdened
[1:57:09] not for that which we would for not for
[1:57:12] that we would be unclothed
[1:57:13] but clothed upon that mortality might be
[1:57:16] swallowed up of life
[1:57:18] now he that hath wrought us for the self
[1:57:21] same thing as god
[1:57:22] who author also hath given unto us the
[1:57:25] earnest of the spirit
[1:57:26] therefore we are always confident so
[1:57:28] because of this because we've got a body
[1:57:30] in the heavens
[1:57:31] we're always confident hallelujah so
[1:57:34] even in trouble we can be confident in
[1:57:35] that trouble
[1:57:36] even in a trial we can be confident in
[1:57:38] that trial because the lord is my help
[1:57:39] he's my strength he's my god he's got
[1:57:42] this
[1:57:43] other knowing that while we are at home
[1:57:45] in the body we're absent from the lord
[1:57:48] for we walk by faith and not by sight
[1:57:51] so the whole reason we walk by faith and
[1:57:53] not by sight is because there's a body
[1:57:54] calling us
[1:57:56] hallelujah and we are and we are
[1:57:58] confident i say i'm willing rather to be
[1:58:00] absent from the body
[1:58:01] and to be present with the lord
[1:58:05] amen that's why that's why we open with
[1:58:07] that scripture see you then you walk
[1:58:09] walk circumspectfully not as fools
[1:58:12] but as wise that's why we can walk by
[1:58:15] faith
[1:58:16] i've got a body it doesn't get old
[1:58:19] doesn't age doesn't need patching up
[1:58:20] doesn't need a doctor
[1:58:22] it's eternal waiting for me already in
[1:58:23] the heavens
[1:58:25] hallelujah
[1:58:28] so what's revelation got to do with not
[1:58:31] being caught in the net
[1:58:33] everything everything because you can
[1:58:36] see it for what it is
[1:58:38] and you know who you are in the lord
[1:58:41] i mean everything if it's been revealed
[1:58:43] that you've got a body eternal in the
[1:58:45] heavens
[1:58:46] you'll live in such a way that
[1:58:48] everything else doesn't really really
[1:58:49] mean that much to you
[1:58:51] but walking with him oh yes and your
[1:58:53] whole motive and objective is serving
[1:58:55] him and loving him
[1:58:56] now that doesn't mean you don't have the
[1:58:58] internet you don't look at these things
[1:59:00] you know you
[1:59:01] you're not on social media whatever more
[1:59:03] but just don't
[1:59:04] get sucked into the rabbit hole you know
[1:59:08] don't get all caught up into it use it
[1:59:10] as a tool
[1:59:11] as i said there's nothing wrong with
[1:59:12] those platforms but what are you using
[1:59:14] it for
[1:59:17] because unfortunately many people in
[1:59:18] this day and age
[1:59:20] their main form of relationship is
[1:59:22] through a device with people
[1:59:24] not one-on-one interaction but man
[1:59:27] people are made to actually
[1:59:29] have one-on-one interaction not to
[1:59:32] communicate through a device
[1:59:34] and that's a big problem why the mental
[1:59:36] health of this world has fallen
[1:59:39] because everyone's actually discon oh
[1:59:41] we're so connected no we're actually
[1:59:42] very disconnected people
[1:59:44] and that's why this world is part of it
[1:59:46] why it's falling apart
[1:59:48] so i'll leave it with you i don't want
[1:59:51] to have a transient mind
[1:59:53] i don't want to have this changes like
[1:59:54] the weather
[1:59:56] you know i want to have a mind that's
[1:59:57] steadfast lord your word is true
[2:00:00] you've called me your blood has atoned
[2:00:02] for all my sin
[2:00:03] you're going to take me to heaven
[2:00:06] hallelujah
[2:00:07] and i'm going to win because you've won
[2:00:09] i'm going to win
[2:00:10] doesn't matter what battle i face i'm
[2:00:11] going to win the battle i'm going to
[2:00:13] wrestle and overcome
[2:00:14] hallelujah have the overcomers in you
[2:00:17] how how can't you overcome
[2:00:20] hallelujah we'll just leave it there
[2:00:23] let's have the musician's place this
[2:00:25] morning
[2:00:28] we might go into these things a bit
[2:00:30] later but
[2:00:32] there's a web but we've got tools that
[2:00:35] cut the web
[2:00:37] hallelujah aren't you glad you get so
[2:00:40] you know you see something that's caught
[2:00:41] in a net you know you just cut it out
[2:00:44] yeah so how's this going to happen in a
[2:00:46] prayer the lord will fight the battle
[2:00:48] and set people free
