[1:20:42] so we just a tiny cigar store in a rock
[1:20:44] and no story today no more ELISA just
[1:20:45] like brother Isaac preach so well about
[1:20:47] a month ago community - a pretty Co
[1:20:49] assume tiempo DRA your preacher you're
[1:20:52] built on a rock MOC loomed a low so we
[1:20:54] do not Roca and he sees the gates of
[1:20:56] Hell shall not prevail against you visa
[1:20:58] que no la puerta el infierno prevalent
[1:21:00] now I used to read that scripture your
[1:21:03] solely a lady's accurate una and I used
[1:21:04] to think if I'm built on the rock of
[1:21:06] Jesus Christ your Ben Sasse you're a
[1:21:08] sido if you con la roca Jesu Christo and
[1:21:11] all withstand the attacks to the enemy
[1:21:13] so you yesterday contra el amigo and to
[1:21:15] a degree that is true yeah I confirm lo
[1:21:18] que la verdad
[1:21:19] but a gate is not an offensive weapon
[1:21:21] pero way too important no algo que
[1:21:24] support yourself you are ma you don't
[1:21:26] build a whole bunch of gates if you're
[1:21:27] gonna go and buy the country with been
[1:21:29] called a know gone through year a poor

[1:21:52] catapults okay and if you gotta go sake
[1:21:55] boy instead of wayna para la die young
[1:21:56] because the guide is a defensive way
[1:21:58] yeah i defense
[1:21:59] porque él por tener una una forma
[1:22:02] defensa
[1:22:03] so when Jesus said the gates of Hell

[1:22:34] rid of that no gate of hell can stop you
[1:22:36] not worth any fear enough waiting for a
[1:22:38] day
[1:22:38] nothing can stop you receiving the
[1:22:40] promise now they look whate but i don't
