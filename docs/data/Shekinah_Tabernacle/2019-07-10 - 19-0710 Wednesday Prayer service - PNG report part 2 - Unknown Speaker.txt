========================================

back and forward so he's very smart man but he was he was the district fresh Britta of the same denomination brother cops he wasn't two years ago that denomination took him to America I can't remember the name of it across denomination they they took him to America and they wanted to make him bishop of I don't know if the whole country of Papua New Guinea of that denomination or what but then the Lord started dealing with them and these people don't cry a lot they're very stoic kind of kind of people and he said the law started everything him and he said the Lord said to him do you want to you want me to be the high priest or do you want to be the high priest yeah he just he's just out of crying said Lord forgive me I don't want to be a bishop I don't want to be a high priest so he quit and he stayed at home for a year praying and then the message came his way hallelujah now this brother was translating for me and he said after the services he said he had to fight so hard not to start crying as the word was impacting him so much and after one service I was closing him prayer then in the service finishes and it's only me and him standing on the on the platform and he comes to me says did you put your hands on me like this when you're praying at the end I said no I didn't put my hands on you he said someone came and put put their hands on my shoulders and I thought it was you praying for me that now wasn't me Holly there's no one else there I mean he's very impacted he said manners are so powerful you see he never never been in meetings like this with him you know with the messages he's just so blown away by the scripture because I asked them I said do you know you're prophesied of in the Bible and they didn't know I said well let's go to roof let's go to Rahab you know let's go to the woman at the well and I went through all those let's go the book of Esther wait a wonderful time hallelujah brother could been said something to me we're about here on that winch they'd last pre-meeting us here hey and that came to pass exactly what you said Allu yeah we serve a supernatural God why we do amen so uh so here's most pretty much all the ministers that were there so this is the host pastor brother Robert pasty Maas you know so brother Anton here was here's the one who was witness to by the cop see this is this is brother Michael he's from so these are Highlanders apart from have pasty mas and so they're quite stoic kind of not a lot of emotion but we had a service and and I felt lead to preach on the seal of God in the mark of the beast and in that service I'm so brother Ronnie dear who's translating at the end of the service people coming forward for prayer we pray for everyone brother Michael just because he is song leading he just starts weeping over the pulpit not just crying over but just just weeping I'm conflate can't even close he's so happy and free he's can't get the words out he just rejoicing and hum and hidden brother Ronnie says now the service he said he said he said it was a bit of that service three or four minutes where I didn't need to translate everyone understood in their own language everyone understood in pidgin no I don't know when that was because I just you get anointed and you just off you go they see it was like they Pentecost again they were so amazed mister God we serve hallelujah they know that were blown away because it wasn't just him but all of them recognized it out because because brother because I was in concert but he said I just stood there for four minutes while the Lord was speaking hallelujah we had a glorious though because the thing is member you have mechanics but it's the dynamics you need and this is the age of both I mean there's been a quickening happened to us bride hallelujah so that's why he was he was so happy weeping just rejoicing he just couldn't control himself he's so glad and um yeah yes I was wonderful time so this this is pastor Roberts a yute now now brother ed this is for you okay this isn't okay so one one of the people he knows founded out of the bush and they dragged out of the bush some mechanic friends fix it up that's a nice issue ute with a nurse and bull bars and the tray on the back is from a Hilux and it doesn't start you got to push that it so so I said I'll be the Kiwi battery I'll help push that this thing and so we're driving down the road and there's some weird noises coming out the gearbox I can't describe just this real weird noises and also added this front tire was you know we thought madness I don't know how this thing's going to go but it made it and so anyway so he took it down to because they had to drive a few case down to the river for the people to get baptized I didn't go to the baptism me and pasty Moss had a head of town fellowship and I by the way brother Isaac passed a moss tells you if you need a cameraman for the movie you've got a cameraman if you need a black brother to play a part you've got one and and he'll do his own stunts that's what he said ok so I've got to pass it on to you I got a facet out of me create a great time anyway so it's so brother Robert drives this thing down to the baptism down to the roofer and coming back was much these noises were really really bad and I'd been dry and this was the Thursday the baptisms happened the whole week before that I was driving with a minute and then and then he said coming back to the baptism they said lord I need my youth to keep going because you know the conventions going on can you fix it the noises stopped and it's not just a little noise yeah and it's like this is really bad I'm not in the camera thought man we're gonna hit - right you know but stopped and they didn't and I was driving with him in it for the rest of time didn't come back hallelujah amen praise the Lord yeah so here's some of the people you know who coming up for prayer and things but the Lord I've never seen them respond normally they're very quiet and they were clapping they were excited now rejoicing in such of us you know such a Liberty you know it's such a glorious time yeah and you're just amazing there was testimonies of of you know people would say I'll give the test may say you know I can for prayer they didn't say who pray for them it didn't matter but I said yo when I got pray for a burden lifted this heaviness lifted me yeah I mean I mean I mean lifted from me and you know things like that happening so it was really good so this is so Christine might know who this is this is sister July from rebels brother Ezekiel so now he lives down in Leh which is four hours drive on the coast but he needed to get some paper work or education from pasty Moss from home so he thought so Ezekiel thought that a moss was going to pass you know viola and give it to him but he mustn't know I'm flying up to grow here you have to come up he's never been here before anyway he gets on a bus he was there for the for that service with a Lord spoke but that way and so he so he's not coming to the message yet but he's already started a bit of a home fellowship down in lay and we need a church to lay how loose I and he was on leave that one service I believe there's a reason he was there yeah they means that any 20:26 he see people come to him for prayer and you know they oh praise the Lord hallelujah now so you know how sometimes your flights get canceled and you wonder why you know I flew in so it's not I flew into Papua New Guinea customs was fine transfers was fine it was all good I get into Port Moresby Airport go to the counter your flight I got bumped off the flight so yes the land of the unexpected so you know this place you have anyway don't get bumped other slide okay so I go and get get retic ative for the next morning they put me up in a hotel anyway so I didn't know so this is brother Pat hall and his wife and end boys and he lives and he lives and Moresby he's like the only believer in Moresby anyway so I get bumped off this flight I get a phone call for him from this guy hello are you staying I'm brother Pat LV nice to meet you sake come down here so so so we had some fellowship and it was wonderful good you know because he was wandering here you know here like a lot of questions about things and and you know I said two-minute answered a lot of his question I said you know many people come out of denomination but the nomination doesn't come out of them anyway so meetings are done we had a wonderful time the people were so happy and blessed I see and okay and and then so I go to my flight I'm sitting in grow career port like what should have been here not just boarding but flying away announcement over the loudspeaker your flights been canceled so I go back to the yo get get retaken it I'm there for another yeah I mean another another night preach another service and I fly down to Moresby worth with pasty moss and we have more fellowship with brother petal and he says oh can you dedicate Joshua our four month old so he had a baby dedication he said oh this is why he that's why your flight was canceled he had to dedicate Joshua but after that happened and I and I and I walk them to the gate of the hospital I mean I mean of the hotel I came back to a room the Lord just really came down was like the trips done I had this by such a you know release was so wonderful but um we had um we hate questions and answers on the last the last day and four hours later I finished them but they asked about yo serpent seed all different kinds of things and and and the brother said now I understand serpent seed and now it you know now it's now it makes sense now it's clear you know just so many things like they see it about how you know you start preaching about you know how hear it because I covered a whole bunch of things yeah I show prophecy in the scripture down to how we should treat our children husbands wives everything and they it was just you know such a wonderful time they really appreciated it but the Lord the Lord directs everything you know but I'm yeah but I see it men and and and I said why you know why can't we always have conventions like this I said well conventions should get better every time that's why you can't compare the camp we're going to have to the camp we've had before it'll be better opal you know just be way way up high cuz that's what the Lord does so yeah and then also we were talking about okay so that surrounds all the brothers your sisters even who came I was talking to the brothers about translation work and a few years ago we did have some translation work going from or from from some other brothers brother Derek got a lot of translation work but the translations weren't very good so we got part of them to be revised by the Saints up and up and rebelled just a little bit but but not all the work that that he had done but thing is is 8 million people maybe 40% of them speak English maybe they can't read most of them can't read so having out having them and then also with the pidgin language it's evolving constantly faster than say English is so because it's you know as me to be a bridge between the local languages and English always mean to be like a bridge but anyway so we're talking about audio translation and and pasty Massa's English is excellent very good and so he's sitting next me on the plane and in any of the message book in his hand and was and and then their eyes are open and they knew him or something I come in what it was cool but he just he just written the front first page it's translated in pidgin to me perfectly fine and uh yeah I know enough language to actually kind of follow what he's saying and so he's gonna start is where we need to pray he's gonna start doing audio translation and to you know in your into pigeon and then the other brothers say brother our brother Ronnie wherever he is his brother only here and a few of the other brothers they're gonna be be doing the written translation but it's the audio I meant because this message has gotta go there's a lot of cracks and crevices in that country it's got to get there God knows were as bright as well would it give him something to work with I mean so so he's going to start the audio translation oh we need to pray for pastor boss and they're going to have meetings in rebel evangelistic meetings and in september and also we need to pray i need to go back to so you probably won't really go back to the beginning so brother Robert who's the pastor of this church he's a church planter he's not married never been married but he wants to get back in the field linking because that's what he's always done he he said he said it used to be he had fast and prayed the Lord would tell him to go to a certain place there'd be a revival in the church or God would start a church or supernaturally and so he feels to get back in the field so they from another church his his brother John here who he felt lead to bring his family to Goroka to to take over the church and the church and groke is happy about it other Roberts happy about it other John's happy about it but brother John's not very well he's been sick for two weeks since he left Shambhu he's been he's been in broker for two weeks and he's been sick and so we need to pray for you brother John because brother Robert needs to get out we I want to go home who wants to go home I want to go home amen so we may not be able to do much but we can pray I mean because up there the denominational Spirit is very strong and very aggressive and you know one day hopefully we'll get past emos here and and he'll share better what he's been through with that but as I said these people we will see them again amen these your brothers and sisters so remember the bride and Papua New Guinea I see to them because what are the questions they asked was should we um we as a good if the government helps us I said we don't need the government to help us it's the Lord that helps us we don't need to lean on yeah because other bands need about the Reformation it was the government that shielded the believers in that day it wasn't like the book of Acts I mean so they have what they need to get the gospel out they mean sure we you know feel we can support them but you know what I mean like they have the tools if God's on them they're equipped amen and there's message you'll live through them but we had a wonderful time thank you for your prayers I really yeah I really agree I mean I think I think it's all I have a me so just yeah pray for y'all pray for your brother's Amy I mean it's um maybe you want to cut the video but there's anyone have a prayer request before we go to prayer
