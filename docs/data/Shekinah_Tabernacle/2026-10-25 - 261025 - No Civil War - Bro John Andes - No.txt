Good morning. &gt;&gt; Are you happy? The first song we're going to sing is this one. You asked me why I'm happy. So, I'll just tell you why. Because my sins are gone. I'd like someone to tell me what a greater thing you could have in your life outside of your sins being gone. Therefore, it shall make you the most happy. So, I can't think of anything more valuable than that. The fact that all of our sins are gone. Take everything else, but just take away that. I'm good. Take away my sins, Lord, I'm good. Do whatever else you want to me in my life or whatever. Just do that for me. I'm good. Which he has. Amen. We got Latabo on the piano this morning and she plays really nice like a little.

Because [music] my sins are gone. And when I meet the scoffers [music] who ask me where they are, I say [music] my sins are gone there underneath. There underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. [music and singing] They're as far removed as darkness from the wood. [music] They're in the sea of gospace. is good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. [music] Was at the old time altar. God came in my heart [music] and now my sins are gone. The Lord took full possession and [music and singing] the devil did. I'm glad [music] my sins are gone. They're underneath. Lord, [music] there are blood on the cross of Calvary. They're as far removed as darkness from the [music] there in the sea of God. Forgetfulness [music] that's good enough for me. Praise God.

An upper [singing] room party. [music] They were drunk on the new wine. Jesus stood among them and they knew [music] there was no doubt. This holy ghost fire, it will make you [music] dance and shout it just like fire shot up in my bones. This Holy [music] Ghost fire is shot up in my bones. is just like fire shot up in my bones. His holy [music and singing] ghost fire is shot up in my bones [music] from his mother's bed. Born to prophesy. The prophet [music] Jeremiah would lift his voice and cry. He quiet the folk command. Shut up and [music] leave us alone. But they said, "How can you be quiet when there's fire down in [music] your bones? Feels like my shot up [music] in my bones. This whole [singing] ego fight is shot [music] up in my bones. It's just like fire. Shot up [music and singing] in my bones. This holy ghost fire shot [music] up in my bones. fell in an open set upon Elijah's bones. The dead [music] man resurrected and he ran back to his home. When he tells the folks a story, well, you could hear him say, he said, "I [music] found that holy power in a dead man's grave just like shot up [music] in my bones. This Holy Ghost fire is shot up in my bones. It's just like fire. Shot up in [music] my bones. Holy Ghost fire is shot up in my bones. Well, [music] some people get offended because I leap and shout. [music] They say too much emotion and too much moving about, but don't tell me to be silent [music] or to sit down in my pew. Cuz if you felt what I felt, well then you'd be shouting, too. [music] It's just like fire shot up in my bones. [music] This whole eagle fire is shot up in my bones. It's just like fire. Good shot up in my bones. This Holy Ghost fire. [music] This is a special guy. Well, some people get offended because I leap and shout. They [music] say too much emotion and there's too much moving about. But don't you tell [music] me to be sad or to sit down in my pew. Cuz [music] if you felt what I felt, well then you'd be shot, too. It's just like [music] shot up in my bones. This Holy Ghost fire is shot up in my bones. It's just like fire [music and singing] shot up in my bones. This Holy Ghost fire is shot up in my bones. It feels like fire. Oh, it shot up in my [music] bones. This Holy Ghost fire is shot up in my bones. It's just [music] like fire shot up in my bones. This Holy Ghost fire is shot. One more time. It's just like fire. Oh, it's shot up in my bones. This Holy Ghost fire is shot up in my bones. It's just like fire. &gt;&gt; Shot up in my bones. This Holy Ghost [music] fire is shot up in my bones. [music] Amen. You can take your seats this morning. &gt;&gt; I noticed there's quite a few more people here. So the brother Kubin's sort of squeezing everyone in. You realize that all the brothers on the front row get called up for all the examples. You know say come up here brother. [laughter] You too brother. So be ready. That's why nobody sits there except Dave. Dave's got courage. Um, [applause] so we've got a special this morning. We just got one special um from Brother Onius. Where is he? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come up here, brother. Someone play. &gt;&gt; It's not that you don't play well. The tabbo. We'll find a time where we'll sing and you play. I want to greet you all in the wonderful name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; This time I see sister Naomi, we think of music. The first time we sang together years ago, I said, "Sister, can you do you know this song? Can you beg me?" And you said, "Uh, there's a piano out there. Let's go right now. So we went there. I haven't seen you for years. So when I saw yesterday, the first thing I thought, you think you can play this song? Said there's a piano right there. Let's go out there. So one day I plan to visit you down in South Island. I'll carry my rifle to hand with brother Matthew. You got guitars there? Your place? I'm sure I got a piano, but do you have a guitar? Okay. So, I don't need to get a guitar. When I come over there, we say, "Okay, sister, we going to really sing." All right. I want to teach you all the songs I know and you teach me all the songs you know. So, it's going to take some time. Might take us some days. Right. Just before I sing, I don't intend to take your time, but just feel like saying this. There was this man. He was traveling somewhere. It was in a forest. Quite a wild forest, right? The mountain. The sides are steep on this side, steep on that side. On the path that he was walking on, suddenly he saw this very large snake. You know those snakes in the Brazilian jungle, the anacondas right there. That was really a thick snake. So he's trying to go that way and the anal cond is laying right there looking at him. Now he has to go through. That's the path. But it's laying right there. If I go back home, I can't go back home. I got to go through there. But that anaconda is waiting to swallow me. So what do I do? So you can start screaming. You can start jumping. is not going to solve the situation because the anaconda is still there. Then while he was worrying all about it, oh, what's that snake doing there? What do I do? It's going to eat me. It's going to do this. It's going to, you know, a small bed just flew from the sky and landed on that big snake. And he started pecking this snake's eyes. And this neck never moved. And this man said, "What's happening here? I'm afraid of this thing. And this little bed is pecking it. The eyes are sensitive." That's when he realized the snake was dead all along. He was afraid of a death snake. Yes, it was big. He could see it was big. It wasn't moving. So he thought it was waiting to swallow him whole. But it took God to send a little bed to show him, look, this little bed is not afraid of that big snake. But you are afraid of that big snake. So why I'm singing this choruses here? Just an encouragement to someone that situation you are in today. Just start singing. Just start singing. Refuse to see the anaconda is dead. is dead. The Christian walk is sometimes get really hard. But have you tried singing, sister? Have you tried singing? Have you tried singing, brother? Give it a try. Give it a try. And you find out that snake was dead all along. And I have KG. We just sing it normally. Won't we won't make it worship. Just sing it. Sing it. just speak. You'll sing it no more. Okay. Down on my knees, [music] I found [singing] my Jesus. Down on my knees, I saw the Lord. [music] Not on the mountain, [singing] not in the valley, down on my knees. I sought the Lord. Down on your knees, you found [music] your Jesus. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; down on your knees. You sought the Lord. Not on [music and singing] the mountain, not in the valley, down on your knees. You saw [music] the Lord down on our knees, down on your [music] knees.

And I think it's just appropriate that we thank the host pastor and his family and the church for their hospitality and the meetings and just being here. So on behalf of us and uh mom and dad uh I should say pastor and our pastor and his wife who wanted to express our appreciation and say thank you and say God bless you. And uh we we've got brother Isaac and you singing with us? Give givea You got to give Isaac a hand. Hey, give him a hand. [applause] &gt;&gt; And I I I I wanted to publicly tell him Shakina Tabernacle. They got it this year. &gt;&gt; All right. They got it this year. So I want to say we appreciate you. Thank you for the food and uh the fellowship. And uh I um you know the benefits of being a of your p your father being a pastor is we uh we landed in the villa you know on the on the waterfront. We've got a beachside view and a villa and we walked in there and there was a gift basket and I saw a tie and I told I said that's my tie and cufflinks and when we opened the fridge there was drinks in there. So being a PK's kid there's a few benefits now and then. So I wanted to say thank you to brother Ben and sister Christine and brother Kuben at the back there and the believers. Thank you very much. So may you be blessed and may God bless you.

Did you enjoy last night's service? My thank you. [applause] My [cheering] thank you, brother Jonathan. Ah, now that that's some real preaching. &gt;&gt; That's some ministry right there. I I I just sit there and think, what am I doing here? I heard brother Daryl Ward was coming to the South Island and Christ Church to their kind. I said, "What does New Zealand need me for? They don't need me." And then after last night, I felt like crawling under a carpet or something. I'm like, "My goodness, what do I have to say?" God bless you, Brother Jonathan. Amen. That was fantastic. Amen. Well, we want to bring you greetings from our our little church and and greetings to the saints uh in New Zealand. To the saints that are in uh New Zealand. Sounds like we're reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh this is our little church again. We opened four years ago. Next Sunday be our end of four uh four four years now. We're going into our anniversary services. And we started in the uh building on the top, a community center, and then the Lord gave us a place that we can rent. I I wanted to show you and greet our greet you from our family. And uh we have three children and six grandchildren uh two boys and a and a girl and their children. And we just are thankful to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, how are the sheep doing today? &gt;&gt; I missed these yesterday. I bypassed them and I I don't know how I missed you but lambs and the sheep but uh I just pray that we would become like this. Amen. Hallelujah. Our mouths wide open. Our hearts are open. We love the word. &gt;&gt; My the Lord has done great things in New Zealand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Years ago my wife was um in New New Zealand. She had born and raised in the message. Her father's a pastor in Australia and she came here for some meetings at the end of December and she's 18 years old and a couple ministers were preaching and and she gave her heart to the Lord and and it was so wonderful. She went back to Australia for some time and then came back here and she started visiting a lot of the message churches here in New Zealand. And at that time, this is a long time ago. This is like 33 years ago. Well, we've been married 33 years, 34 years. And what was so disappointing to her was is there was just a lot of fighting going on in the churches and this church against that church and this church against that church. And it was so disappointing and so discouraging to her as a young uh Christian that had given her heart to the Lord. I think sister um Martin experienced that also in her area there. And so it's not just in New Zealand but other places. And so before we get in to our sermon this morning, we're we're speaking on no civil war. &gt;&gt; No civil war. And and I just wanted to say that um young believers uh cringe when there's fighting going on, &gt;&gt; when there's a lot of church fusses and church feuds going on and and church politics, it will drive your youth into the world. And so this morning is going to be just a little bit of uh a warning, but also just some words of instruction to you, my fellow brothers and sisters. Just some wisdom of the Holy Spirit and all of the things that go on since the Lord's called us to serve him in in the light of this message. And it's but if we're not careful, coldness can come in. I know I'm speaking here on the Sunday morning after a wonderful meetings and times, but we can't live at family camp. &gt;&gt; We've got to go back Monday, Tuesday. We got to go back to our lives. &gt;&gt; And these are mountaintop experiences and really some of the best times of our whole lives. And but I just want to say this that if it gets to where it's becomes stale and formal and indifferent starts moving into our churches that will quench the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; In fact, Paul said quench not the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And so a person can actually have the Holy Spirit and quench him. And so just remember that that a lot of church wrecks and things have happened and family have broken up and relationships have been broken because of a lack of love. &gt;&gt; And if you'd like to just write that down or in your heart, a lack of love. I was look looking at what brother Brandham said this morning about lack of love. Lack of love. It'll it'll it'll drive Christ right out of our midst when we can talk about it, sing about it. But we really don't have the depth of what it really is. &gt;&gt; And even brother Brandham, do you remember when he crossed over and had that experience of seeing his first wife and and she said and then he came she came back into the room and was patting him on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry about us." &gt;&gt; She had passed away and Sharon and his daughter and and don't worry about us. Don't worry about us. and he's p she's patting him in the room and and you've sung about it, you've talked about it, you've preached about it, but you really don't know what it is. And he said, "What are you talking about? Heaven." So if a prophet can preach about it and we can sing about it and talk about it and we really don't know what it is, is it possible that we that we can talk about love? We can hear messages on love. And I I really feel it's got to come from behind the pulpit, too. If if our ministry become where we're arrogant and proudful and we're the only ones that's got it and you know we've got the great revelations and and we start talking down the you know the the little church over here or that church over there and you know we're we're the big you know we're the mega church and we're the church in New Zealand that's got the deepest revelation. That kind of rhetoric will drive the Holy Spirit away because God is in the church in the mission. &gt;&gt; He's in the youth group. if he's with the young ladies and young girls today that might might go back and not even have a friend. &gt;&gt; In our prayer meeting this morning with the brothers or yesterday, there was one person that expressed that they're the only ones in their family that are believers. &gt;&gt; Then it's important at times like this that we have love one for the other and and not just talk about it, but people can sense whether you love them or not. That's true. &gt;&gt; And if we're trying to win the world for Christ and we can't even win one another, we're missing something. &gt;&gt; If we're trying to win people to receive the message and yet we can't even love one another, we're missing it. &gt;&gt; We can talk about it and sing about it, hear great messages preached about it, but I want it in reality. Who wants it in reality today? So, I just had those comments to say about that and receiving the Holy Ghost and and being born again is a good start, but your adoption is your placing &gt;&gt; and that's the maturity. &gt;&gt; And so, I I can sense in New Zealand, God's done great things in your lives and giving you great revelation. And we're all in a process of in our of receiving the Lord and being justified, being sanctified, being filled with his spirit. But we must go all the way to our maturity. And that is your adoption is when the word begins to grow through you. Christ grows through you and he can see in your life that you have the character &gt;&gt; to be able to reflect his word. And so be before I have you stand, I I wanted to say that the Lord wants us to use the sword of his spirit against the enemy. &gt;&gt; And often times as believers, we can become so aggressive and so zealous in our terminology that we begin to fight one another. We actually take the sword of the spirit and the word and begin to oppose and react and respond in a way that's not the nature of Christ. And the Holy Spirit in a service like this is just putting up a warning flag, a stop sign or a yield sign or just just maybe you need to just look at it another way. YOU CAN BE TOTALLY RIGHT IN YOUR DOCTRINE, but if you're wrong in your spirit, something's not right. And we can drive one another away from the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can offend our children &gt;&gt; and lose a whole generation in the message when THEY HEAR HOW GREAT OUR GOD IS AND HOW WONDERFUL a message has come and we go back home and fight &gt;&gt; and have strife &gt;&gt; and war. Today the Holy Spirit is calling an end &gt;&gt; to that kind of war. &gt;&gt; No civil war. &gt;&gt; So God bless you. Let's stand together again before we read. I'd like us to lay hands on one another and just reach across to that sister, that brother, please. And let's just pray that the Lord will give us strength and patience as we are hearing his word. Even our little children and our babies could just be calm today. And our dear heavenly father, lift up your hands over this congregation. Lift up your spirit of healing in the name of Jesus. May we be healed. You said in your word, "If my people that are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and look to that place that you will forgive them of their sins and you will heal their land. Heal our land, Lord. Deliver us from evil. Fill us with THE HOLY SPIRIT. CAP OFF OUR LIVES WITH THIS GREAT capstone of perfect love. scatter away ALL THE DARKNESS AND ALL THE EVIL, all the demon SPIRITS THAT MAYBE WE'VE catered to or been uh negligent of. Maybe we've been negligent, Lord, and not mindful of our character and how with it we are. Maybe we are offending someone, our spouse or our children. Maybe there's someone in the church that we could be more of the nature of Christ to. Lord, we lay hands on our brothers and our sisters. believing that demon spirits are cast out, our very hands laid on one another, we can bring healing, our very shadow over our loved ones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus, may every heart here today be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I thank you for the word that we heard. I thank you for the quality of the ministry. I thank you for the character of the New Zealand bride that is now coming to a capstone. Bless them Lord &gt;&gt; on this Sunday morning. I bless them in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; May their babies and their children and their teenagers, their offspring with them be there on that great day. Hallelujah. WHEN THE BLUE GRASS IS BLOWING in the wind, let these brothers and sisters come running over the mountain HAND IN HAND, SHOULDERTOSH SHOULDER, SAY, "WE MADE IT BY THE GRACE OF GOD." YOUR MERCIES are new every morning. BE NEW TODAY, LORD. CLEAR AWAY THE FOG of war. AND MAY THE HOLY SPIRIT, LORD, DROP DOWN INTO THE SOUL REALM. Come into our spirit. BRING BACK, LORD, A SISTER THAT'S WANDERED IN HER MIND. Oh Margaret, oh Margaret, COME BACK TO YOURSELF TODAY. OH BROTHER, OH SISTER, COME BACK TO THE MIND OF Christ &gt;&gt; and heal our bodies. I pray in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; IN JESUS NAME. &gt;&gt; And the church said &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's turn to the scripture in 2 Samuel chapter 2. And I thank you for your patience. I thank you for your kind attention as we come into this. I'm aware of our lunchtime schedule and um this is something been on our hearts and I wanted to bring it to you as one of your friends, one of your fellow uh servants, just washing your feet with our tears and knowing that our time is short and the days are evil. I just pray for the next few minutes, the Lord would season our words with his oil because we might need it. And if I say things that are uh clear and not between the lines, I just pray that God will give you grace to receive it and me grace to say it. &gt;&gt; I was in prayer today on my knees and I was Lord, if I say that, if I do that, so just be in prayer today before we go to lunch. 2 Samuel chapter 2 was a time in the message David had now come to be the king of Judah and Jonathan and Saul had died in the battle. And we're going to be just soaking in the nature of Christ this morning. Just watch his attitude. Watch his spirit. And then things begin to happen in the message. Chapter 2 11, David was king in Hebron for 7 years and 6 months. But then verse 12, we see that Abner Abner was the the general for Saul's army. Saul was the king of Israel. And now it was King Ishbath was the king. And Joab was under King David. And we find in verse 12 that Abnner came to this place in verse 13 and Joab. So Abnner was the the leader or the general for Saul's army. And David, David's leader in verse 13 was Joab. And and they went out and met together by the pool of Gibian. and they sat down and one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool. We're just going to have some good Christian message fellowship. &gt;&gt; But in verse 14, what happened? Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men now arise and play before us." &gt;&gt; And Joab said, "Let them arise." This, in other words, they said, "Let's have some war games. Let's let them sport." And the moment you bring your young people into the fight, you've lost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they pulled their young people in to this war game. Verse 15. And there arose and went by number. So 12 of Benjamin and which pertained to one side and 12 of the servants of David. So now we have 24 young people in the message. 12 on one side. Verse 16. And they caught one. everyone his fellow by the head and thrust his sword to his fellow side. So they fell down together. Now that's when anybody in their right mind SHOULD HAVE SAID, "STOP IT." &gt;&gt; WE GOT 12 YOUNG PEOPLE ON one side, 12 in on another. WE'RE IN THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; That's when ANY GODLY MOTHER SHOULD HAVE SAID, "I DIDN'T RAISE MY SON for this. But you look down through the next few verses, what happened? Just skip down to verse 26. And Abner called to Joab and said, "Shall the sword devour forever? Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness to the latter end? How long shall it be then, heir thou bid the people return from following their brethren?" And Joab said, "As the Lord liveth, unless thou had spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up everyone from following his brethren." So Joab blew a trumpet cuz there was a civil war going on. They're killing one another in the message. &gt;&gt; And Joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they anymore. And you look down through these next few verses, verse 30, Joab returned from following Amnner. And when he had gathered all the people together, their lack of David's servants, 19 men, and Ashel, we skipped those verses, but Ashel was a relative of Joab. And it's going to come back to hurt Abner because he died. So there was 19 or 20 that died on one side. Verse 31. And the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin and Abnner's men. So they had 303 score 360 people died on one side. Chapter 3 verse 1 speaking this morning on no civil war. The Bible says there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. I thought we were supposed to be all in the same message. Long war. Verse six. And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abnner made himself strong. And it goes on to talk about these things. God bless you. You can have your seats today. Are you ready to hear the word? Yeah, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, "We can scream and shout or do whatever we want to, and it'll never influence men until they see the life of Christ being projected in you." &gt;&gt; Someone who is tender and merciful and forgiving and ready to turn the other side of the cheek or give the second coat or go the second mile. Christianity in action. &gt;&gt; How many want to be a real Christian? Yes. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY'S THANKFUL FOR THE MESSAGE GOD sent in this day? &gt;&gt; How many KNOW THE MESSAGE IS CHRIST? &gt;&gt; Are we getting people to Christ? &gt;&gt; ARE WE GETTING ONE ANOTHER TO CHRIST? Do others see Jesus in you? &gt;&gt; Not just taught from the pulpit, &gt;&gt; but acted among the members, among the pastors. That's when you see Christ living in the church and decisions are made. We could scream and SHOUT OR DO WHATEVER WE want to. It'll never influence men until they see the life of Christ being projected in you. &gt;&gt; I want others to see Christ in me. &gt;&gt; We've been born and raised in the message. We've been born in the fire and we don't want the smoke. &gt;&gt; We don't want the fog of war. And the fog of war is when people on the same side start killing one another. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHEN THE THE BATTLE GETS TOUGH AND THE SWEAT COMES DOWN INTO YOUR EYES and you're and and there's men and women AROUND YOU THAT ARE dying and young people and people that you've been raised with and people that is maybe going to the world or families that are struggling. IT CAN PUT A CERTAIN TYPE OF SPIRIT AMONG US EVEN IN New Zealand WHERE WE START TO FIGHT ONE another &gt;&gt; and we start to war one another. In 2 Samuel 12 verse 10, this is Nathan the prophet prophesying to David. He said, "The sword shall never depart from thine house." Amen. &gt;&gt; In 1 Coronicles 28:3, this is God speaking to David because now it had come to the end of David's ministry and there was a transition into the new generation. And how many can recognize that you in New Zealand are in another season? &gt;&gt; Times have changed. &gt;&gt; Seasons have changed. AND YOU'VE GOT TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY in the season you're in. &gt;&gt; And here WE ARE IN 1 CORONICLES 28:3. God speaking to David. I'm trying to move along. Thou shalt not build an house for my name because thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood. A man of war is warlike. That's in their disposition. That's in their countenance. Have you ever looked into the face of someone and you can just see that they're upset? &gt;&gt; You can look into the eyes of a person and tell a lot about that person. You can often times look into a into the eyes of a person and tell whether they're in distress, whether they're whether they're fight or a flight mode. AND SOMETIMES AS BELIEVERS, we can get into that mode. I know we're in camp today and everything's good, BUT WE'RE GOING INTO A BATTLE THIS WEEK. AND THERE'S TIMES WHEN WE WANT WHEN WE HAVE WE FEEL LIKE FIGHTING and there's times we feel like fighting &gt;&gt; and it's not wrong to FIGHT AND IT'S NOT WRONG TO RUN. You know, you know, remember Joseph got out of that place. But it's finding the mind of the Lord for that season. Yes. &gt;&gt; Remember in modern events made clear by prophecy 1965, brother Bradom said it was Jesus Christ in David. &gt;&gt; It was Christ in Noah, Christ in Moses, Christ in Joseph. IT'S JESUS CHRIST AMONG his people today. &gt;&gt; How many WOULD SAY THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE MORE IS MORE OF JESUS in our lives? BUT WHEN DAVID COMMITTED ADULTERY WITH BASHEBA, THAT WAS NOT CHRIST in David. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PROPHET CALLED OUT THOSE SHEBEARS AND KILLED TH THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE, THAT WAS NOT CHRIST IN THE PROPHET. So there's SEASONS OF OUR LIVES THAT WE CAN SAY THAT'S CHRIST IN ME. THAT'S CHRIST IN THE CHURCH. THAT'S CHRIST IN THE MINISTRY. BUT WHETHER YOU WANT TO ADMIT IT OR NOT, WE ALL HAVE THE HINDER PARTS. &gt;&gt; WE ALL HAVE WEAKNESSES. WE all have flesh. &gt;&gt; WE ALL HAVE COMPLEXES. WE ARE A product of the environment we've been raised in. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY OUR CHURCHES SHOULD BE A SAFE PLACE. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE A PLACE WHERE SHEEP AND LAMBS COME TO. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S NOT FIGHTING IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; OUR HOMES SHOULD BE A REFUGE &gt;&gt; FROM THE STORMS OF LIFE. AND WE SING ABOUT IT. BUT WHEN WE SAID, "I SPEAK THE NAME OF JESUS OVER YOU," THERE IS AUTHORITY AND POWER IN YOU AS A MAN AND AS A WOMAN, AS A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CURSE, YOU CAN SWEAR, YOU CAN GET ALL UPSET. YOU CAN HIT YOUR FIST AGAINST THE WALL, OR YOU CAN SPEAK JESUS into the situation. &gt;&gt; And Jesus IS NOT A FIVE-LETTER WORD. IT'S POWER AND THE LIFE BEHIND THE NAME. And the message is not 1,200 sermons and it's not volume so and so and year so and so. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; If you remember Moses IN NUMBERS 20 11, THE PROPHET MOSES WHEN HE STRUCK THE ROCK TWICE CUZ THE PEOPLE NEEDED WATER. AND FRIENDS, WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT RIGHT AWAY WHETHER THERE'S VICTORY, WHETHER there's tambourines, whether there's loud MUSIC OR GOOD PREACHING. WE WE STILL NEED WATERMEN. &gt;&gt; BY MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, you can BE LIVING OFF THE THE AURA OF MEETING SO LONG, BUT WE STILL HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE WELL. &gt;&gt; WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE A FOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; AND FOR BELIEVERS, THE FOUNTAIN FOLLOWS US. &gt;&gt; IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, THE ROCK FOLLOWED THEM. GMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; AND THAT ROCK IS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY SPIRIT IS WITH YOU, even in you, &gt;&gt; TO CAUTION YOU, &gt;&gt; TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR, &gt;&gt; TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE BEING OFFENSIVE, &gt;&gt; TO TELL YOU HOW TO RAISE YOUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; OUR PASTORS IN THE MESSAGE WAS NOT CALLED TO RAISE YOUR FAMILIES. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, YOU ARE THEIR FATHER. YOU ARE THEIR MOTHER. &gt;&gt; GOD HEARS YOUR PRAYER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT REALIZE TODAY IS IS FROM BEHIND THE PULPIT. THE THE HOLY SPIRIT IS EMPOWERING THE CONGREGATION. &gt;&gt; BUT FOR MANY YEARS, A LOT OF OUR UH THE WAY THAT IT WAS TAUGHT AND THE MESSAGE, IT WAS FUNNELED IN TO THE PASTOR AND TO THE TO THE PULPIT AND AND THEY HAD TO BE DYNAMIC AND THEY HAD TO BE CHARISMATIC AND IT ALL REVOLVED around that. AND IT WAS TOTALLY OPPOSITE. THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST IS TO PUT THE WORD INTO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And we made superstar preachers and mega churches AND AND EVEN A CHURCH DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A MEGA CHURCH. IT CAN BE A SMALL CHURCH AND HAVE AN ARROGANT SPIRIT &gt;&gt; AND BE proud &gt;&gt; in the message. I've noticed that as we've traveled been able to travel around the world, I've noticed that you have in certain areas churches and and it's almost like they're they're the elite church. They're the church with the revelation &gt;&gt; and it kind they carry an aura with them even when they're around people and they kind of look around the way they talk about other churches and other ministries and other youth groups. It's always negative. It's a AND THAT IS NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT. I SAID THAT IS NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; Remember Moses struck the rock and water came. But it WAS THAT VERY THING LATER THAT CAUSED MOSES TO NOT TO GO INTO THE PROMISED LAND IS WHEN HE STRUCK THE ROCK TWICE INSTEAD OF SPEAKING TO THE ROCK. And it MIGHT HAVE WORKED YEARS AGO FOR YOU TO STRIKE THINGS AND HIT things and BE A TYPE OF PERSON THAT TAKES THE SWORD, BUT WE ARE LIVING IN ANOTHER SEASON. &gt;&gt; SAY, I'LL JUST PREACH THE SAME WAY AND GET THE SAME RESULTS. YOU MIGHT DO THAT, BUT GOD WILL DEAL WITH THAT PRIVATELY IN YOUR LIFE. AND BROTHER JOHN HAS PERSONALLY seen message CHURCHES THAT HAD CHOIRS AND AND GREAT CHURCHES AND AND GREAT MUSIC CRUMBLE AND ARE LITERALLY NOTHING TODAY. &gt;&gt; I COULD SAY NAMES AND I'M NOT GOING TO. IT'S NOT THE CHOIR. IT'S NOT THE SINGING THAT'S GOING TO GET US IN A BODY CHANGE. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BE THE WORD IS EFFECTUAL AND IT'S CHANGING LIVES. AND THEY ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE JESUS. &gt;&gt; Take this as A WARNING TODAY AND AS A A STRONG encouragement to us. &gt;&gt; Remember when MOSES STRUCK IT TWICE, WATER came out. They still had camps. They still had youth meetings. They still had church. &gt;&gt; HOFFMAN'S HEAD WAS STILL, you know, hanging on the platform. YOU KNOW, THE CLOUD PHOTO WAS IN THERE. BUT SOMETHING HAD BEEN LOST. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING WAS NOT THE WAY THAT IT USED TO BE. AND THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT IS GOING AFTER TODAY. TO RESTORE UNTO YOU ALL THE YEARS. &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE, SAYETH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; I just want to say some things very clearly. YOU CANNOT GO ABOUT THIS present season that we are in doing things the way you used TO BE AND EXPECT THE SAME RESULT. WE ARE IN ANOTHER SEASON. &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD DIDN'T ALLOW DAVID TO BUILD THE TEMPLE CUZ HE WAS A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART. BUT BECAUSE HE WAS A MAN OF WAR AND BECAUSE HE HAD SO MUCH BLOOD ON HIS HANDS, GOD HAD TO RAISE UP HIS SON SOLOMON THAT WAS A MAN OF PEACE. And the only way I'm speaking out of family camp THAT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHURCHES WILL BE A SUCCESS GOING FORWARD IS WHEN WE ARE A peaceloving people. &gt;&gt; God's people love peace. &gt;&gt; God's people I'm saying some things today. &gt;&gt; God's people are not warlike. God's people are peaceful. &gt;&gt; So what is brother John? What is civil war? Civil war is war between citizens of the same country. Is it getting a little warm in here? Are you a little warm? I think brother Cuban can help us with that. Civil War. And it's good for your children to hear this today. &gt;&gt; It's good for your young people to have a a minister come and actually preach on this. &gt;&gt; They might be sitting there very very quietly or looking down the row like this. &gt;&gt; But us parents need to be alert. &gt;&gt; Us older ones, us elders in the message need TO TAKE NOTE ON WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I I'm speaking to you TODAY FROM A HEART OF A MAN THAT'S BEEN BORN and raised in the message. &gt;&gt; And you watch ministry, even in New Zealand OR GLOBALLY, THEY SPEAK DIFFERENTLY WHEN THEY'VE BEEN RAISED IN the message. &gt;&gt; IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE A TESTIMONY. GOD DELIVERED YOU FROM smoking and drinking and drugs and and a lot of those things. But when you have uh men of God or sisters THAT HAVE BEEN BIRTHED BY THE WORD AND THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH AND RAISED, THEY TALK TO PEOPLE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; THEY TREAT THE CONGREGATION DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; Now y'all got quiet really fast. &gt;&gt; It's the love of God to you &gt;&gt; when he has gifts like you heard last night. IT'S THE LOVE OF GOD TO YOU THAT GOD WOULD ACTUALLY TALK SO CLEARLY to one of to us today on speak a message on no civil war. I could have spoke on a thousand other titles, but we have to speak what the Lord lays on our hearts. &gt;&gt; War between two countries. If you're writing notes, I just want to speak about civil war. Civil war can be within the individual &gt;&gt; war things going on. Always battling, ALWAYS WARING. THAT'S YOUR MIND. That's your spirit. &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR BODY. &gt;&gt; You have one one soul today. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SATAN HAS NO RIGHT TO COME INTO YOUR MIND AND DESTROY YOU. &gt;&gt; Come on. I I'm I'm I'm BATTLING WITH YOU. I'M JUMPING DOWN INTO THE TRENCH AND SAYING, "YOU HAVE ONE BODY. GIVE IT AS A TEMPLE TO THE LORD." &gt;&gt; I'M NOT HERE TO rebuke you. DON'T TAKE THIS AS BROTHER JOHN REBUKING ANYBODY HERE. I'm I'm just a a middle-aged man myself, getting older. MY MY BODY IS A TEMPLE OF THE LORD. YOUR MIND IS NOT THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND. &gt;&gt; All the SWIPING AND AND THIS AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS DESTROYING THE NEW GENERATION AND THEIR ABILITY TO EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND ANYBODY THAT MINISTERS KNOWS THAT THINGS HAVE CHANGED. IT USED TO BE BEFORE WHEN I WAS IN NEW Zealand uh 30 years ago and we had a a meeting in a sheep sharing barn and a youth meeting. Some are here that were there. WHEN WE GAVE AN ALTAR CALL, EVERY PERSON IN THAT BUILDING WAS AT THE ALTAR EXCEPT FOR ONE OR TWO, THREE PEOPLE. TODAY YOU HAVE AN ALTAR CALL, YOU MIGHT GET ONE, TWO, THREE, FIVE. WE ARE IN ANOTHER SEASON. THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS LIFTING UP OFF THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU WANT TO ADMIT IT OR NOT, IT'S LIFTING UP OFF THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT READY TO GO BACK TO THE JEWS. &gt;&gt; HELLO, BRIDE OF NEW ZEALAND. &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING AT THE END OF REVELATIONS 10. AND RIGHT BEFORE REVELATIONS 11, WHICH IS MOSES AND ELIJAH COMING BACK, &gt;&gt; and they're going to LOVE THE MESSAGE JUST AS MUCH AS YOU LOVE IT TODAY, THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; It's Christ. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE RIGHT AT THAT TIME OF THE SPIRIT LIFTING OFF THE EARTH FOR THE GENTILES. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME IN THE BIBLE WHEN THE BIBLE SAYS, "I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH." &gt;&gt; And people would just be slaying in the spirit. And they would WALK WITHIN JUST BLOCKS OF ISUZA STREET. Y'ALL HAVE HEARD OF THE ISUZA STREET REVIVAL IN LOS ANGELES. My wife and I's been right down there and walked down there WHERE THEY WERE. THEY SAID WITHIN BLOCKS OF THIS REVIVAL, PEOPLE WOULD JUST BE SMITTEN and repent of their sins. &gt;&gt; FRANK BARTLEMAN WAS A BLACK MAN AND other people THAT WERE LEADING SPEARHEADING THAT ISUZA STREET REVIVAL. THEY THEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE AN ORGANIZED MUSIC PROGRAM AND AND EVEN THEY WOULD GET INTO A CORNER WITH A BOX OVER THEIR HEAD AND JUST BEGIN TO PRAY AND BEGIN TO PRAY FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND THE MIND OF CHRIST AND THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS POURED OUT UPON THAT. IT WAS A PENTECOSTAL REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU AS BELIEVERS KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING BACK. WE WE ARE GOING FORWARD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS A SHOCK THAT WAS THAT WAS A SHOCK THAT WAS AROUND THE SEED. BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN THE SHOCK PULLS AWAY. &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE LIVING IN THE TIME FOR YOU AND I TO COME TO FULL MANIFESTATION. &gt;&gt; LORD, help us to just be focused. civil war between an individual. Number two, civil war in marriages. Satan comes in quarrels and fighting in marriages. You can have and remember I'm SPEAKING NO CIVIL WAR. IT'S TIME TO STOP IT. &gt;&gt; Waring number three IN FAMILIES, THINGS THAT GO ON IN FAMILIES. God brought you together. God allowed those things to happen. DON'T YOU BE THE PERSON THAT'S ALWAYS COMBATING AND ALWAYS DISPUTING. YOU'RE ALWAYS OPPOSITE. &gt;&gt; Remember friends, you can be you can have the HOLY SPIRIT AND BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU. THERE'S DIFFERENCES OF ADMINISTRATION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT PAUL TAUGHT US. &gt;&gt; THERE'S DIFFERENCES of approach. Even in ministry, WE CAN HAVE OUR FAVORITES OR WE CAN FA THIS BROTHER KIND OF MINISTERS TO ME MORE. I RECEIVE MORE FROM THAT BROTHER OR THAT BROTHER'S DEEP OR THAT BROTHER'S SHALLOW. BUT REMEMBER, AS A PACKAGE, &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT YOU MIGHT COME AGAINST OR NOT EVEN LIKE, YOUR YOUNG PERSON MIGHT BE RECEIVING from that. &gt;&gt; SO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT &gt;&gt; ABOUT MINISTRY AND ABOUT CHURCHES. IT MIGHT BE THAT VERY SISTER OR BROTHER THAT HELPS WIN THEM TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK NEGATIVE ALWAYS ABOUT THE SONG LEADER AND YOU GET HUFFY AND PUFFY CUZ THEY DON'T SING your the way that YOU LIKE. I JUST LIKE THE OLD FAVORITE SONGS. I JUST LIKE on the wings of a snow white dove. Do you know THAT WAS A SECULAR song that was being sung? I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE NAMES OF THE WRITER AND WHO SANG that song. only believe WAS SANG BY UN PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T EVEN BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST THE SONG, IT'S WHO'S SINGING IT. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to go here for ABOUT 30 SECONDS. WE ARE BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; And whatever music and the beat and THE WAY THAT IS SECULAR AND OUT IN CHRISTENDOM, THERE OUGHT TO BE A LITTLE CHECK MARK FOR US AS BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT BRING A SONG IN. WE MIGHT SAY, "WELL, THAT WAS GOOD OR THAT WAS THIS." BUT THAT BEAT IS from hell. &gt;&gt; And rock and roll IS THE MUSIC THEY PLAY IN THE REGIONS OF THE LOST. &gt;&gt; SO, GIVE ME A QUOTE FOR THAT. SOULS IN PRISON. NOW, &gt;&gt; WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS A YOUNG BOY, 14 YEARS OLD, AND THEY SHOT HIM THROUGH THE LEGS AND BLOOD WAS GOING EVERYWHERE, AND HE SAID, "LO," AND HE CRIED OUT TO GOD. HERE IT WAS YEARS LATER, &gt;&gt; 40 YEARS LATER, JUDGMENT. HE'S 54 and he's there there AND THE ESCALATORS GOING UP AND DOWN AND he heard the women coming up talking GOING ON ABOUT THE PRICES AND SO FORTH. BUT HE SAID IT'S THE SAME SOUND I HEARD WHEN I WENT DOWN INTO THE REGIONS OF THE LOST. Do you KNOW THAT'S THE BACKGROUND MUSIC FOR AC/DC? YOU PLAY IT BACKWARDS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. AND ANYBODY THAT'S EVER STUDIED MUSIC KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS TRUE. IT'S THE BACKGROUND MUSIC. YOU TURN IT AROUND, ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC, IT'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL TO HELL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND YOU BRING THAT INTO THE CHURCH, YOU WILL QUENCH THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT AGAINST DANCING IN THE SPIRIT, BUT I'VE SEEN A LOT OF DANCING AT MEETINGS AND CHURCHES IN THE MESSAGE, AND THAT OFFENDS THE HOLY SPIRIT. IT BECOMES SEXY. IT BECOMES WOMEN, A LOT OF WOMEN. IT BECOMES A LOT OF THIS. YOU CAN GET QUIET ALL YOU WANT TO. I'M HERE TO PLEASE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AND EVERY HOLY GHOSTFILLED BELIEVER OUGHT TO AGREE WITH THIS. WE WANT TO PLEASE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "YOUR THOUGHTS ARE HEARD LOUDER IN HEAVEN THAN YOUR WORDS ARE ON EARTH." &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU LISTEN TO IN PRIVATE, WHAT YOU'RE FEEDING IN IN PRIVATE IS BEING PIPED THROUGH HEAVEN. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO. I I DON'T I NEVER SAID IT ABOUT THE BROTHER, BUT I THINK IT YOU'RE YOU'RE GUILTY OF MURDER. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be embarrassing today if GOD HAD TO TELL THE ANGELS TO GO PLEASE turn down the volume of what's being coming through heaven because there's a lot of nonsense going on through my Holy Ghost fil believers that are down on earth. Number four is amongst friends you can have civil war. &gt;&gt; They're at variance. There's strife. They used to be close. They used to fellowship. They used to text. They used to call. I'm not I understand their seasons in our relationships, but don't become a fighter. &gt;&gt; Number five is amongst churches. WE CAN GET A SPIRIT OF COMPETITION. AND I'M JUST GOT TO go here. WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF RUGBY AND SOCCER and football and football and basketball and this and that and THE OTHER. AND IT BRINGS A SPIRIT OF COMPETITION &gt;&gt; AMONGST OUR FAMILIES, AMONGST OUR TEENAGERS, AMONGST EVEN IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS. AND WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL THAT DON'T COME INTO THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT HERE TO COMPETE WITH ONE ANOTHER. BROTHER JONATHAN MARTIN IS A MAN OF GOD. I'M A MAN OF GOD. WE DID NOT COME FROM AMERICA TO SEE WHO CAN PREACH THE LOUDEST or the DEEPEST OR WE DID NOT COME FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT COMPETING. &gt;&gt; WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM. &gt;&gt; And when you sing a song or YOU GET IN FRONT OF THE THE THE CHURCH AND I'm looking for a microphone. Here's one. And and we NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WE DON'T GET INTO THIS POSTURE, YOU KNOW, AND OUR HANDS HAVE GOT TO JUST BE RIGHT. AND WE JUST GOT TO LIFT UP OUR VOICE. AND FRIENDS, WE ARE HERE TO MINISTER TO ONE ANOTHER, &gt;&gt; BUT MINISTER TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THERE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN YOU SEE HOLLYWOOD COMING INTO THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; By the way, if you're praying about being a minister, you're out of your mind. &gt;&gt; If you want to be a minister, &gt;&gt; you better make SURE IT'S THE HOLY Ghost leading you. Souls of MEN AND WOMEN DANGLE OVER HELL BY ONE WORD. &gt;&gt; BUT IF THEY DANGLE OVER HELL, WHAT ABOUT THEY DANGLE ABOUT RAPTURING FAITH AND GRACE AND MERCY? JUST SPEAK ABOUT LOVE AND YOU WATCH THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE CHANGE. &gt;&gt; I could start right now and SPEAK FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS, young people, young girls, young boys, PEOPLE THAT'S BEEN SLEEPING HALF out of it, NO ATTENTION, THEY BECOME IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED. WE ARE NOT HERE HERE TO BECOME CANDY CANE MINISTERS OR CHRISTIANS WHERE WE'RE JUST HERE TO BRING SOME EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT IN. &gt;&gt; WE'RE MORE DETERMINED THAT GOD BE WITH YOU ON TUESDAY AND ON WEDNESDAY &gt;&gt; AND ON THURSDAY. HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW DID THE WORD AFFECT YOU? &gt;&gt; DID IT CHANGE YOU? &gt;&gt; LORD, I WANT TO BE CHANGED. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Number six is civil wars between uh countries. You know, I'm from Australia. I'm from New Zealand. I'm from America. I'm I'm from SOUTH AFRICA. AND THEY WATCH WITH a they just walk with a pride that you know there's all this pride and arrogancy and it can cause war. Number seven is amongst believers IN CHRIST AND AMONGST THE BODY OF CHRIST THERE CAN BE CIVIL WARS. There can be tension and STRESS THAT COMES IN RELATIONSHIPS AND FIGHTING THAT GOES ON. NUMBER EIGHT, LASTLY, is the civil war amongst message believers. You didn't want me to go there, did you? For years, you know, you'd go to meetings AND THEY'D PREACH ABOUT THE BAPTIST, THEY'D PREACH ABOUT THE PENTECOSTAL. AMEN, BROTHER. YOU PREACH ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. PREACH ABOUT THE POPE. YEAH. [screaming] WE pastored for some years down in Tennessee when I was 23 years old. Just young boot camp, you know, just young. Just really young. That was good for us. Amen. Now I'm getting older and I forget what I was going to talk about about Oh yeah, here it was. And our precious brother, he was the loudest AMENER IN THE CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. [screaming] AND ABOUT REVELATION, YOU TALK ABOUT THUNDERS and rainbows and all that. HE WAS RIGHT THERE. BUT YOU TALK ABOUT FAMILY. YOU TALK ABOUT THINGS RIGHT DOWN TO HOME. It just gets quiet. &gt;&gt; Don't go there. &gt;&gt; You know, I was with you, BROTHER, WHEN YOU WERE QUOTING OUR PROPHET. BUT NOW YOU'VE KIND OF GONE OUT ON A LIMB A LITTLE BIT. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY to do that. &gt;&gt; Say, who gave you the authority? The Holy Spirit. And you know, maybe it's just our makeup and and we're a brother John, but I always consider the innocent and ones caught in the crossfires of war. I always consider the collateral damage and those that are hurt and offended, the weaker one among us and people that ARE NEW CHRISTIANS. WAR IS A HORRIBLE THING. I THINK AFTER THIS SERVICE, the Lord is really working in hearts right now. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; War is a horrible thing. &gt;&gt; Anybody that even has A HEART, HEARS WHAT'S happening on the news in Palestine or Israel or Ukraine or Russia. &gt;&gt; WAR IS A HORRIBLE THING. HAVE Y'ALL SAW PICTURES AND IMAGES OF ALL THE BUILDINGS, all the families, all this, all the killing, ALL THE WARING, ALL THE BLOOD, &gt;&gt; ALL THE STRIFE AND ALL THE MURDER, all the politics. You know, I can speak about our country, America, that brother Brandham talked about. We have it in America. We have the politics and you have the Democrats, you have the Republicans and like they'll have a vote on something AND THEY'LL BE JUST AS OPPOSITE. IT'LL, you know, you have a hundred members and and it'll comes down to 4951. &gt;&gt; You have 400 and somebody 400 and something representatives, you know, have all THE ONE PARTY VOTE THIS WAY AND ALL THE OTHER PARTY VOTE THIS WAY AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET VOTES TO GET SOMETHING THROUGH. IT'S POLITICS. DON'T BRING THAT INTO THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; DON'T BRING THAT SPIRIT INTO THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; I'm going to sit down ON YOU BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE YOUR SON. I DON'T LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; Where if you knew what WAS GOING ON PRIVATELY AND YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON, THE HOLY SPIRIT KNOWS EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES THE LORD WILL REVEAL JUST SOME LITTLE SOMETHING about a loved one or family member and YOU'LL JUST GO ON at some TANGENT SOMEWHERE. YOU'LL BLOW UP THE CHAT. YOU'LL BLOW UP THE TEXT. AND THAT'S WHY GOD CAN'T REVEAL DEEPER THINGS to us. &gt;&gt; Do we REALIZE ALL THE BREAKUPS IN HOMES? WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IN THE MESSAGE ONENESS, HE SAID, "ANYTHING THAT COMES BETWEEN YOU IS NOT OF GOD." when churches AND I'M GOING TO COME DOWN A LITTLE TIGHTER WHEN CHURCH MINISTRIES ALWAYS FOCUSED on fighting and war and swords even in the MESSAGE &gt;&gt; AND IT STARTS in Sunday school you walk in and there's Ephesians there's the soldier there's the man and he's got his helmet and and I'm not saying THAT'S BAD TAKE UNTO YOU THE WHOLE ARMOR OF God &gt;&gt; and then they come into the service and they hear about war and they CARE ABOUT FIGHTING EVERYBODY TRAINING FOR WAR. IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, IT WILL RAISE A WHOLE GENERATION IN OUR CHURCH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE. THEY'RE FIGHTERS. THEY'RE WARRIORS AND THEY'RE KILLERS. AND IF YOU DON'T COME TO OUR CHURCH AND IF YOU DON'T STREAM OUR website and if you don't say good things about them, they become WARRIORS AND FIGHTERS. AND THAT IS NOT THE HOLY GHOST. the the armor is AGAINST THE ENEMY. IT'S TO BE DEF IT'S THE THE SHIELD OF FAITH IS TO STOP THE FIERY DARTS, THE SWORD AND ALL THE WEAPONS OF DEFENSE OR OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD AND WARRIORS FOR THE LIVING GOD. BUT YOU START PREACHING THAT EVERY SERVICE and every day and every one of your opening comments and all of your filler is fighting and waring AND LET'S GO TAKE THE HEAD OFF THE DEVIL. YEAH. [screaming] WOW. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, IT'LL BREED A WHOLE GENERATION OF FIGHTERS. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE NOT PART OF OUR YOUTH GROUP AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH US AND THEN IT BECOMES JUST OVER THE TABLE, you know, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TALKING AT THE LUNCH. &gt;&gt; I'm just putting it out there as a warning. &gt;&gt; GOD, HELP THE OLDER GENERATION. &gt;&gt; You live BY THE SWORD, YOU'LL DIE BY THE SWORD. I had that in my notes. It was in my next statement and I didn't even know. But just remember that, friends. &gt;&gt; I know that we're here in New Zealand and we're not back in America, but let me just give you a little bit of history about the American Civil War. Can I do that? &gt;&gt; The American Civil War. And if you look at these pictures that I'm showing you of all the shooting, all the killing, even ironclad, they called the boats and things ironclad. It becomes a certain mentality. It went on for four years, one month and two weeks. CIVIL WAR, PEOPLE OF THE SAME COUNTRY. AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE BROTHERS? &gt;&gt; Aren't we supposed to be in the same country? four years and one month and two weeks. It goes on to say that this American Civil War, this is in 1861 to 1865, it was a civil war in the United States between the Union, the North and the Confederacy, which was the South. And certain states in the South succeeded from the Union. And this whole conflict and things was in dispute. It wasn't all about slavery, but they used that as an emotional thing to actually put it out there and it began to expand to other territories. The American Civil War, you say, "Why do you talk about this? Why do you even bring up a natural thing?" Because it when you see it coming in AND BREEDING INTO THE SPIRITUAL, WE NEED TO TAKE NOTE of this. One of the things about this the the Civil War that a lot of people don't maybe realize, Brother Brandham spoke a lot about Abraham Lincoln, but it was actually in this in the season when he won presidential election. HE WAS A GOOD MAN, BUT IT WAS WHEN THE SPIRIT OF THE nation and the Confederacy came and and and wanted TO BREAK OFF FROM THEM. SEE, SOMETIMES YOU CAN SAY, "BUT IT'S FOR A GOOD REASON, OR IT'S IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE, OR THIS BROTHER DON'T BELIEVE IT A CERTAIN WAY, or he doesn't BELIEVE IN THE THIRD POOL, OR HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THE SEVEN seals have been revealed, or but friends, DIDN'T GOD GIVE YOU A SPACE?" THERE MIGHT BE A TIME THAT WE'RE A CERTAIN WAY AND WE'RE VERY STRONG ABOUT IT AND VERY PASSIONATE AND THEN A FEW YEARS GO BY AND GOD REVEALS THAT THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO IT. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE. NO MATTER HOW THIN YOU SLICE SOMETHING, THERE'S ALWAYS two sides. &gt;&gt; And everybody wants grace. Everybody wants forgiveness for yourself. BUT WHEN IT'S FOR SOMEONE ELSE, IT'S LIKE, OH MAN, &gt;&gt; but you don't know, brother John. I don't need to know. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT KNOWS. &gt;&gt; By the way, Brother Ben glowing and I probably had about few minutes together. He hasn't told me about what's happening. I've had very little time with brother Andy, brother Freddy, brother an Andrew Donaldelsson, my precious friend, brother Als and Tennessee. I haven't spoken to your pastors about your needs here. I believe it's the Holy Spirit. I &gt;&gt; I just feel and I know that you have done very well New Zealand. I've seen it in your love and in your brotherly kindness for one another. So, I'm not speaking about anything that someone spoke to me last night for two hours in my room. It didn't happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't hardly speak to my wife for two hours last night. In fact, our, you know, our young people that was next door to us, they came in later, like after midnight. They were so loud the night before. Brother Freddy, Brother Freddy, and those old young people, they were so loud the night before. We're trying to go to sleep and THEY'RE DA DA DA. So somehow my wife mentioned it jokingly to them and last night it was quiet. I think the party was at, you know, the Jeffrey's house or something and I I went to sleep good last night. Be very very careful. Be very sensitive about your movements, &gt;&gt; especially at this time. &gt;&gt; Ask the Lord if it's his perfect will &gt;&gt; for you to do whatever's in your mind to do. &gt;&gt; Cuz you might feel justified. You might feel totally vindicated, &gt;&gt; but you've got to BE MINDFUL OF THE SHEEP. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO BE MINDFUL OF the lambs. AND IT WOULD BE BETTER for you to be having a millstone hung around YOUR NECK AND CAST OUT IN THE OCEAN OFF THE New Zealand coast than to offend one of God's lambs. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU TO BE CAST INTO THE SEA AND GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND DROWN THAN FOR YOU TO GET ON YOUR LITTLE WEBSITE OR YOUR LITTLE CHAT BOX AND YOUR LITTLE social media &gt;&gt; or GO AFTER CHURCH AND BUM BUM. YOU CAN DESTROY THE EFFECTS OF THIS THIS CHURCH SERVICE FROM HERE TO THE DINING HALL." &gt;&gt; That's true. SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY QUICK TO GET OUT OF THAT DOOR. THEY NEED TO COME THE OTHER WAY. &gt;&gt; AND IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD IF IT STARTED WITH THE ELDERS. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in message blushing prophet and and those messages. He said, "And I'll be the first one who would join me at the at the altar today at the altar." And he came RIGHT AROUND IN THE BRHAM TABERNACLE AND HE PRAYED AT THE ALTAR. MY YOU GOD, GIVE US MORE LEADERSHIP like that. &gt;&gt; That's right. WILL NEVER BE THE PROPHET, BUT HE WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE. &gt;&gt; Did I offend anybody yet? &gt;&gt; So, in the civil war, there was like a wave of enthusiasm that swept through this time. You know, everybody was feeling vindicated because of their position. But I want you to look. I'm not asking you to take any notes of this graph or I'm not going to give you a test. But you can look on one side the United States and the other side the Confederate States. You can look on down through there. I want you to see the casualties and the losses of civil war. &gt;&gt; I'm just focusing a little bit those that were killed in action. KIA or DO died of wounds. Can y'all see that on the screen? &gt;&gt; 110,000 for the one side, 94,000 on the other. 230,000 died from accidents or disease in the United States Army. In the Confederate, it was 164,000 died from accidents or disease. 25 to 30,000 people died in the prisons on one side. On the other side, it was 26,000 to 31,000 died in prisons. You see the wounded wounded, broken hearts, broken homes, discouraged. God forgive me, but when our church services become to where our young people check out halfway through &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE BORED, THEY GOT THEIR ARMS CROSSED. &gt;&gt; AND OUR PASTORS AND OUR MINISTERS AREN'T SENSITIVE to that. &gt;&gt; We're too interested in the 99 and the TITHE PAYERS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE GIVING GOOD MONEY OFFERINGS. AND WE'RE not willing to allow our messages to get off the MOUNTAINTOPS AND COME DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS. &gt;&gt; There's a scripture for that. In the valley, he restores our soul. &gt;&gt; Especially for some of our brothers. I'll give you two scriptures. In Samuel, David said, "Thy gentleness hath made me great." &gt;&gt; In Psalms, HE REPEATS THE SAME VERSE. THY GENTLENESS HATH made me great. This is a man of war. THIS IS A MAN OF FIGHTING. &gt;&gt; Thy gentleness hath made me great. I've learned to be gentle. Can you all see that on the screen? How many casualties? &gt;&gt; And even free civilians died. There were mothers that died in the crossfire. There was grandmas. I'm just sitting out on my porch. I'm 73 years old and all of a sudden a bullet, &gt;&gt; an arrow, &gt;&gt; a cannonball. &gt;&gt; We're just all sleeping in our HOUSE AND ALL OF a sudden a cannonball rips through the living room and takes some of our young people. &gt;&gt; No civil war. By the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure had been destroyed. Can you imagine all the the fences, the roads, the buildings in the South? Much had been destroyed. When it collapsed and slavery was abolished, 4 million enslaved black people were freed. AND YOU'D SAY, "PRAISE GOD." BUT WHAT ABOUT THE COST? YOU SAY, "I DON'T THINK ABOUT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE." BROTHER JOHN, you're insane. You don't think about how it's being taken. You've lost your mind if you don't think about what people think about you and how you're coming across. &gt;&gt; You offend. You hurt others and yeah all THE TIME YOU JUSTIFY YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; You know what YOU'RE DOING? YOU'RE PART OF A CIVIL WAR. &gt;&gt; And let ME JUST SAY THIS VERY NICELY. MOST OF THE TIME THE people we offend the most are people right around us, &gt;&gt; OUR SPOUSES, OUR CHILDREN, &gt;&gt; people in our church. &gt;&gt; And I say, "GOD, FORGIVE US." AMEN. &gt;&gt; I lift our HANDS AND I SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE US IF IF I'VE COME ACROSS HOTTIE AND proud &gt;&gt; and arrogant." &gt;&gt; When you walk out of an airplane and you I think I mentioned this on Youth Without Borders, but you go out of an airplane and you walk up this jetway up to the airport. I think they call it a jetway. On the sides there, they sometimes have advertisements or stickers and things. When you fly into Seattle or Vancouver, I'm just forgetting which one. Along the side, they say this airport is a safe place. Have y'all heard of that before? Tell somebody. &gt;&gt; If you're being trafficked, if something's going on sexually, abused and drugs, you're flying in here because you've been taken from another country against your will, someone's forcing you, tell somebody. &gt;&gt; This is a safe place. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S AN AIRPORT. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE OF THE WORLD HAVE RECOGNIZED THERE HAS TO BE A safe place. &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE A PLACE THAT IF SOMETHING'S GOING ON PRIVATELY THAT YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE AND THEY WILL BE AN ADVOCATE FOR YOU. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT TODAY, OUR HOMES, OUR CHURCHES, OUR CAMP SERVICES LIKE THIS SHOULD BE SAFE PLACES. &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AND AND RELATIONSHIPS. I'M NOT SPEAKING IMMORALLY. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHERE WE CAN OPEN UP OUR HEART AND TELL SOMEBODY WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND IN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES WHEN WE WALK AWAY, IT'S NOT OUT ON THE CHURCH CHAT. &gt;&gt; PLEASE PRAY FOR THIS YOUNG PERSON. SHAME ON YOU. &gt;&gt; I'VE HAD IT IN AROUND THE WORLD WITH PRAYER LINES AT YOUTH meetings and youth AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE NEXT WEDNESDAY AND THE NEXT SUNDAY, WHAT WAS SAID PRIVATELY IS COMING ACROSS THE PUBLIC. &gt;&gt; IT'S COMING ACROSS PUBLICLY. AND I I SAY SHAME ON THOSE MINISTERS. Our prophet wasn't like that. &gt;&gt; IN FACT, IF THERE'D COME A LADY UP IN THE LINE, HE WOULD STOP THE MICROPHONE. HE WOULD SAY, "CAN I say it? SHE'S GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE. SHE'S GOING THROUGH A BLOOD ISSUE. CAN I SAY IT? Can I say it publicly?" &gt;&gt; HE'S VERY RESPECTFUL. OUR PROPHET WAS A GENTLEMAN. &gt;&gt; WHY DID IT RAISE UP A GENERATION IN THE MESSAGE THAT are so arrogant AND AND IT'S MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY? WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? WHY IS THERE ELEMENTS OF THE MESSAGE THAT YOU SEE one after the other after the other THAT CHURCH GROUP THEY STRUGGLE IN THEIR MARRIAGES? WHY? &gt;&gt; CUZ IT'S COMING ACROSS THE PULPIT. &gt;&gt; THAT OUR WOMEN ARE SOMEHOW WAY down here somewhere. She's a byproduct. And they say it with, you know, she buys product and they SAY IT, BUT THEN IT BECOMES A RHETORIC. THEN IT BECOMES THEY'RE TALKING NEGATIVE ABOUT THE SISTERS. Do you know that the SISTERS ARE THE GLORY OF THE CHURCH? &gt;&gt; OUR YOUNG PEOPLE REFLECT YOUR REVELATION. &gt;&gt; We don't even NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE, BUT WE SEE YOUR young people and we see how your sisters are. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just giving you a little secret. &gt;&gt; And if all the sisters ARE ARROGANT AND THEY'RE STRONG AND THEY'RE feminist and THEY'RE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALWAYS TALKING UP, SOME SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. BUT IF THE BROTHERS ARE OVERBEARING AND ALWAYS OUT TO CONQUER THE WORLD AND I'M THE man around here, I'M THE PAPA BEAR. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; I'm just going TO SAY IT PUBLICLY. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; AND PASTORS THAT BUT THE PULPIT THAT MIGHT HAVE WORKED YEARS AGO, &gt;&gt; MOSES, &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT HAVE STRUCK THE ROCK AND SHOOT IT OUT OF THE ROCK, BUT WE are in another season. I'm glad I got money in the bank with some of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can say these things. Some of you, where's he coming from? You don't know me. To you that know us, no. I would never say anything to you that would offend you. &gt;&gt; Even if I knew about it, &gt;&gt; you probably wouldn't know that I knew. But the Holy Spirit knows. &gt;&gt; And he's just like a gentleman. He's just like a dove. and he'll just come down and flutter down and we we say something arrogant. We say something against ANOTHER BROTHER, HE FLIES AWAY. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF US are living like that? HE'S ALREADY FLOWN AWAY A MONTHS AGO. &gt;&gt; You can sing only believe and amazing grace before every speaker. AND IF YOU'VE OFFENDED THE HOLY SPIRIT, the Lord won't move in that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; THEN IT BECOMES A CHURCH CULTURE. And people already know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; AND I JUST SAY, "GOD, OFFENSES WILL COME, &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LET ME BE THE one &gt;&gt; that doesn't exclude you from sometimes being strong and saying something." And the SWORD COMES AND IT GOES and it cuts both coming and going. BUT THEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT, YOU BETTER BRING SOME OIL. &gt;&gt; YOU BETTER BRING SOME BOMB RIGHT BEHIND THAT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN TRAINED VERY WELL BY OUR PROPHET. HE SAID, "SAY SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE THEM MAD and then say something that'll make him glad. &gt;&gt; Say something really strong and then he'll just give a little example and talk about lambs or sheep or what what I was going through this morning." And then you just SAY SOMETHING STRONG. OUR PROPHET DID THAT. But if the whole service is that way, then the next service, the next month, and you're just strong, BROTHER. YOU'RE STRONG, BROTHER. HALLELUJAH. This world's going down. THIS WORLD'S FALLING APART. That's all true. But we're not going down, &gt;&gt; and we're not FALLING APART. WE'RE GOING UP. &gt;&gt; But you CAN KEEP PEOPLE UNDERWATER AND JUST KEEP PUSHING THEM DOWN. KEEP PUSHING THEM DOWN. ALL WITH THE QUOTES OF BROTHER BRANDHAM. You could have 68 quotes. I better preach like it was my last service or last time to you see these states and things. I would just say, Lord, if if there's been civil war in our country of New Zealand, would you help us, Lord, navigate out of that, Lord? If we become always training our people for war, we talk about war. We dream of war. I'm talking naturally and spiritually. We sing of war. Our songs that are written because a minister preached a certain message. So, it's of war. So, for the next three or five years, we're singing that song. We've got our young people singing it. We got the people singing it. They're all into it. IF YOU IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TRAINING for war, we will never accept peace. &gt;&gt; It could be sitting right IN FRONT OF YOU. IT COULD BE STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU'D REJECT IT. SAY, "GIVE me an example. Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; The scribes, the Pharisees, the rulers, THEY KNEW THE TORAH, THEY KNEW THE BIBLE SO MUCH to where it was rolled up in a scroll. You just put a PIN UP THROUGH IT. THEY KNEW EVERY CHAPTER, every verse, every line. Yet when Jesus came to fulfill that, they crucified him. &gt;&gt; IT IS HAPPENING TODAY ALL OVER THE WORLD IN the message. YOU SAY, "WE BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. WE believe this." BUT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, HE COULD APPEAR RIGHT AMONG US IN THESE MEETINGS. &gt;&gt; WITH HIS PRESENCE, PUTTING HIS FINGER DELICATELY DOWN IN AN AREA THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. &gt;&gt; I I I just want to take about a two-minute detour. I I want to speak on behalf OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE, THEN I WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF of the parents. Cuz sometimes OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL LIKE, WELL, THEY'RE JUST GETTING AT ME. THEY'RE JUST ALWAYS AGAINST ME. THEY'RE JUST ALWAYS I CAN'T DO THIS AND I CAN'T GO THERE. IT'S SUCH A BONDAGE. IT'S SUCH A HINDRANCE. I was thinking of this on our walk yesterday before the service. BUT LITTLE DO WE REALIZE THAT THOSE WALLS THAT GOD HAS ALLOWED AROUND US IN OUR CHURCHES, IN OUR FAMILIES, AND FOR YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL IS ACTUALLY GOD'S PROTECTION. &gt;&gt; HE'S KEEPING YOU FROM EVIL. &gt;&gt; HE'S KEEPING YOU FROM HARDSHIP DOWN THE ROAD. HE SEES DOWN THE ROAD AND HE'S TRYING TO SAVE YOU. &gt;&gt; Then I want to speak for our parents. Sometimes we do all we can. We we work. We labor financially. We try to make a home. We'll move to another church. We'll try TO GET THEM IN A GOOD ATMOSPHERE. We'll take them to family camps. We'll try to CAN WE HAVE A YOUTH CAMP? We try to do everything that and then they come up in A IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THEN things start affecting and they start being influenced. I'm being sensitive right now. &gt;&gt; AND THEY START BEING INFLUENCED BY SCHOOL AND BY FRIENDS. I'M thinking of a young lady in Europe that was WHEN SHE WAS 12 YEARS OLD BECAUSE their culture is a little different than New Zealand. They're they're more in the cities and things. So they gave her a cell phone at a very young age cuz she has to go on a train to school. she has to go on a bicycle and go down to the train station and go. So, at a young age, she was already influenced by by the internet and and then boyfriends and then media and then certain music AND SHE'S JUST A YOUNG AGE. Little did she know down the road it would take her young heart into the world and into a relationship and and then what's that condition where you don't want to eat cuz I'm so fat. &gt;&gt; Anorexia. Yeah. I'm so fat. You know, everybody's taking photos and selfies and good times and and then she goes into that way because I see I you know I'm so fat and I'm so big. She wasn't. &gt;&gt; It's a lie from the devil. You're not beautiful. You're not pretty. &gt;&gt; You're just going to be an old nag. Nobody's ever going to want to marry you. You don't have no friends because of your nose or your toes. And it drugged this YOUNG LADY'S HEART. SHE'S RAISED IN THE MESSAGE. IT DRUG HER HEART OUT INTO THE WORLD. SHE ENDS up going to another country, marrying a Muslim. Now she's just divided from her family. And it all becomes opposite. and against. Let me just say this today in behalf of of of your parents. If you've been raised in the message, you are privileged. &gt;&gt; If you raised in a HOME THAT DOES NOT GLORIFY TELEVISION, YOU ARE PRIVILEGED. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A FATHER OR MOTHER that wants to limit your uh cell phone time and your TIME TO WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN SIT AROUND THE TABLE WITHOUT GETTING ON YOUR DEVICE. AND THERE'S A DAD OR THERE'S A MOM SAYING, "CAN'T WE JUST HAVE A MEAL TOGETHER AND TALK TOGETHER?" WELL, YOU KNOW this and THAT. AND WE BECOME A GENERATION OF FIGHTERS AND AGAINST AND OPPOSED. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A MOTHER OR A FATHER THAT'S LIKE THAT, YOU OUGHT TO SAY, "PRAISE GOD." &gt;&gt; I didn't expect a lot of amens &gt;&gt; because if the parents say amen and then the young people, BUT IT'S TRUE. YES. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN LOOK AT THE WALLS as being bad. I can't go out. OR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THAT THESE ARE WALLS THAT PROTECTION FOR me &gt;&gt; and I WANT TO GROW UP TO LEARN to say, "Thank you, Lord. I have a father and a mother." Maybe you're a single parent. Maybe you've been raised in a single parent and she tried. Your mother tried. &gt;&gt; MAYBE SHE'S NOT EVEN IN THE MESSAGE, BUT THE FATHER WALKED OUT. MAYBE IT WAS ALCOHOL. Maybe you're the black sheep of the family. And I don't mean your color. I mean IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE HAD IT ROUGH FROM WHEN YOU WERE BORN FROM SCHOOL. THEY BULLY YOU. They hate you. THEY TALK ABOUT YOUR HAIR. THEY TALK ABOUT YOUR DRESS. THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID FRIDAY NIGHT OR WHAT YOU DID ON THE WEEKEND AND and you're just boring. AND YOU CAN GET A complex &gt;&gt; and it just SETS UP A WARING. IT SETS UP A FIGHTING. I PRAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS THESE TYPE OF MEETINGS LIKE THIS AND AND SERVICES THAT YOU CAN GO OUT OF HERE SAYING I CAN BE A CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; I HAVE GODLY PARENTS. &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO SAY THIS TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE. WE ARE TRYING. &gt;&gt; AND IN SPITE OF OUR FAILURES, GOD IS GOING TO BRING YOU THROUGH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; And I have to make a public apology to every person here, and I mean this seriously. If there has ever been anything that has happened to you that has offended you in this message, I'm sorry. That happened in that church. That happened in the youth group and YOU'VE PULLED AWAY. THAT HAPPENED IN MINISTERS, YOU KNOW, MINISTERS. BUT THAT'S WHERE BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "I ALWAYS GOT IN TROUBLE WAS AROUND the ministers." &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN BECOME AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. We can always see it opposite. Do &gt;&gt; you understand why when I was praying this morning why I just feel Lord if I say that &gt;&gt; it's THINGS LIKE THIS &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING INTO DELICATE AREAS AND BROTHER JOHN &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A PROPHET BUT THERE IS A GIFT in my life AND WHEN YOU GO INTO CERTAIN AREAS AND THE LORD JUST GO THERE JUST SAY THAT THAT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT WE AT SOME POINT WE GOT TO SAY LORD YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT MY LIFE ABOUT MY FAMILY AND IT'S YOUR GRACE AND MERCY THAT YOU WOULD EVEN TALK TO US LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm thinking of a four-year-old little boy that in the time of trouble and his dad is dying and his grandpa's dying. One was the king and one was the prince. And his his maid hears that the dad has gone and she lifts him up and starts running and she trips and falls &gt;&gt; and he BECOMES LAME. &gt;&gt; FOUR YEARS OLD. She picked him up, I'm sure, screaming and crying AND THEY WENT TO LOABAR. THEY WENT TO A PLACE MILES AWAY WHERE THERE'S NO CELL PHONE SERVICE. THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE WANT this new king &gt;&gt; to come and because IF THEY FIND OUT THAT HE'S ALIVE, THEY'RE GOING TO KILL HIM. HE IS THE next prince in line &gt;&gt; and they're going to hate you. THEY'RE GOING TO HE LIVED FOR 16 YEARS &gt;&gt; THROUGH HIS TEENAGE YEARS, THROUGH THE PRIME OF HIS LIFE. And some of our young people deal with pornography. They deal with things that are are 10 times worse. And the music is mastered in hell and designed &gt;&gt; TO DRAG YOUR SOUL INTO HELL. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND THE FASHION DESIGNERS OF CLOTHES, &gt;&gt; THEY'RE ANOINTED BY HELL TO MAKE IT SEXUAL. &gt;&gt; TO PUT ATTENTION TO PLACES THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE ATTENTION TO BY A HOLY GHOST FIL SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD. And the church says, &gt;&gt; AND OUR FASHION DESIGNERS, AND THEY COME OUT OF PARIS OR HOLLYWOOD OR AUCKLAND or Wellington, CHRIST CHURCH, WHEREVER, BUT THEY'RE NOT BORN AGAIN BELIEVERS. and they become skin tight. &gt;&gt; It becomes where young ladies want to play the part and leave the house with my skirt on and then just roll up my leggings and then when I get to school and I'm going to the, you know, the the washroom, restroom, Lou, whatever you call it, and I change and now I'm cool. Now I'm out here. Now I'm myself. Then at 3:00, I'm back in the locker room back in and I'm going to change and get my dress on and go out and see my mama. and they live a fake life. &gt;&gt; I've personally heard of young ladies that were at the altar and they're screaming and in THE SPIRIT AND DOING ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN THE MEETINGS and then in between the services they're fixing their makeup in between the services in the dorm rooms. Something's wrong somewhere. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING'S WRONG WHERE WE GLORIFY CERTAIN THINGS OVER HERE. THE PUBLIC PART OF BEING A CHRISTIAN, BEING IN THE MESSAGE. THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS A REVIVAL YET IT PRODUCES SOMETHING OVER HERE AND IT'S NOT MATCHING. &gt;&gt; AND I SAY, GOD, GIVE US A REAL HOLY GHOST REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND that starts with repentance. &gt;&gt; WHERE I CAN LAY MYSELF AT THE ALTAR. I LAY MY LIFE BEFORE YOU. NOT TO WHERE I WANT TO LEAVE and then get myself all together and then SING IN THE NIGHT SERVICE like I'm the greatest singer in the message. No, you're not. We need more humble SISTERS THAT ARE JUST broken &gt;&gt; that can stand up and sing a song from their heart &gt;&gt; and all of A SUDDEN THEIR VOICE STARTS BREAKING AND CRACKING AND THEY BREAK INTO TEARS. THAT IS WHEN THE CONGREGATION, YOU'LL NOTICE THEY BEGIN TO MOVE &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT'S SOMETHING FROM THE HEART AND IT'S NOT A PUBLIC SHOW. GOD, HELP OUR CHURCH SERVICES NOT TO BE FOR THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL &gt;&gt; OR HOW MANY LIKES WE CAN GET OR HOW MANY PEOPLE FOLLOW US. &gt;&gt; YOU FOLLOW CHRIST, YOU'RE GOING TO BE REJECTED AND DESPISED. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HATE YOU. &gt;&gt; You You say you're thinking in the world. No, in the message. They want to stay comfortable in their little bubble and nobody say anything that'll break my bubble. Don't come into my private life. Let's let James talk to us for a few minutes before our lunch. Are you all doing okay? &gt;&gt; From whence come wars and fightings among you. Come not hints even of your lust that war in your members. Can you all see that on the screen? &gt;&gt; Ye lust and have not. Ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain. Ye fight and war, yet you have not because you ask not. Ye ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you might consume it upon your lust. In the Hebrew series, he said, "YOU PEOPLE WITH THESE SAWBLADE tempers that's always spouting off with the mouth at somebody, can't put up and things LIKE THAT, BE CAREFUL. You're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right." and not just GO AROUND AND TEAR DOWN AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO STICK A KNIFE IN A MAN'S back to kill him. You can break his character and kill him and kill his influence. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; say, "I'm guilty, Brother John. I'm guilty of murder." That's not the unpardonable sin. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ask God to forgive you and say, "From this moment on, I will not allow that spirit to rule my life." &gt;&gt; Think about it. What's going to WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE TO DEAL WITH THE CHURCH GOSSIPER? &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE HOLY SPIRIT. THEY THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR SO MANY MONTHS AND YEARS, THEY'RE PROBABLY THINK THEY'RE THE SPIRITUAL ONE IN THE CHURCH. IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE HOLY SPIRIT TO WORK IN THAT CHURCH GOSSIPER. &gt;&gt; Stop it today. &gt;&gt; Speak against your pastor. Say something bad about him. You might as just well shot him, TOLD SOMETHING THAT WASN'T RIGHT ABOUT HIM. WELL, it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that. AND YOU'RE GUILTY of it. Maybe you don't deal with it like we do in America, but over in America, there's a lot of guns and ammo and shooting and knives. And you have people that are all caught up in war games and movies of violence and rock and roll and heavy metal ROCK MUSIC. IT WILL TAKE YOUR SOUL TO HELL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU FEEL comfortable singing the same type of SONGS AND IN THE SAME TYPE OF MOVEMENTS AS SOMEBODY THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE MAKE IT IN THE RAPTURE? I'M JUST ASKING you the question. You do whatever you want to do. HOWEVER YOU LIVE AFTER camp is between you and God. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'RE A LEADER, EVERYONE UNDERNEATH you will come under that. &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S WHY IT'S A WARNING. THAT'S WHY IT'S WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT. BE CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LISTENING TO SONGS THAT ARE LIKE THAT AND AND YOU'RE WATCHING MOVIES AND THEN YOU'RE PLAY AND THEN YOU'RE PLAYING WAR GAMES. What's on the posters on your wall is warships and fighter planes. I'm not speaking against that. I'm just saying just watch your nature and what you're forming in yourself. Remember, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKING ABOUT THE picture of the warships that were in that that family's bedroom and they wondered why every single one of the young men went to the Navy and they started investigating. One after the other after the other went to the Navy. Y'ALL KNOW THE STORY. AND THEY RESEARCHED IT AND WENT BACK AND THEY FOUND IT WAS A PICTURE OF A BIG WARSHIP IN THEIR IN THEIR BEDROOM THAT WAS ON A CALM SEA. &gt;&gt; That's what they saw in the morning. That's what they saw at NIGHT WAS A WARSHIP OUT ON A CALM SEA JUST MOVING ALONG. AND ALL OF THOSE YOUNG MEN WENT TO THE NAVY. I SAY, GOD, IF IT'S THAT POWERFUL, &gt;&gt; PUT YOUR HOLY SPIRIT INTO OUR ROOMS. &gt;&gt; PUT A HOFFMAN'S HEAD INTO OUR ROOMS. DON'T MAKE AN IDOL OF OUR PROPHET, BUT WE NEED TO BRING THAT ATMOSPHERE INTO OUR HOMES. &gt;&gt; And I'm not speaking about a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; You can play them 24 hours, 24/7, but if we don't have the spirit of Christ, &gt;&gt; I pray God's blessings upon New Zealand, &gt;&gt; upon your churches, upon your families. I speak the name of Jesus over to you that our songs would be healing and deliverance. David played THE HARP AND EVIL SPIRITS went out of Saul. &gt;&gt; HE GRABBED A JAVELIN AND WANTED TO DESTROY DAVID AND DAVID HAD SO MUCH OF THE NATURE OF CHRIST IN HIM. HE PLAYED THAT HARP AND THE EVIL SPIRIT LEFT SAUL. &gt;&gt; All the time HE'S PLAYING WITH HIS JAVELIN LOOKING HOW HE'S going to destroy his character. But David was a man of God. &gt;&gt; He was already anointed to be king. He didn't need a the big uh you know things going around. Rah rah rah you know David's killed his thousand Saul has killed David his 10. He didn't need all the women screaming his name. &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL WHEN ALL PEOPLE SPEAK WELL OF YOU. You know, you go back to our opening scripture, and I I'm mindful of our lunchtime coming up in 2 Samuel chapter 2. We read about Abnner and Joab and bringing the young people into it. Pretty soon you have 24 young people in the message laying around. There should have been some godly mother went screaming out through THERE AND SAID, "STOP IT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT." YEAH. &gt;&gt; There should have been some father say, "What did we raise our young people for? They're dying all around us." &gt;&gt; Why do they keep leaving when they're 14? Don't want to go to church. 15, we struggle with them coming. 16, okay, you can stay home Wednesday, then it's Sunday, then I'm sick. Then by the 16, 17, THEY'RE REBELLIOUS. They're stubborn. &gt;&gt; And I JUST ASK FOR FORGIVENESS. LORD, WHERE DID WE GO WRONG? WHAT CAN WE DO NOW? &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; What could we do now, Lord? Brother Brandham said it was Jesus Christ and Moses. Jesus Christ in Noah. Jesus Christ in Moses. Jesus Christ in David. Jesus Christ and Joseph. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. It's Jesus Christ among his people today &gt;&gt; doing the things that he promised he would do in this age. It's Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and and we say amen to that. &gt;&gt; But the church has become so starchy and so far away. Like the brother said, our churches are becoming the same way. So we've got to have something to shake us back to the word. How do we know it's going to do it? IT'S GOT TO COME ACCORDING TO GOD'S PLAN. GOD'S PLAN IS NO CIVIL WAR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Watch the nature of Christ in David. Watch him when David was leaving out of the city and Shimi is throwing rocks and all the gravel and cursing and swearing. Shimi was a lot of church people. They take advantage of when they think it's going good and they're on a roll, THEY'RE JUST TEARING IT UP. That's &gt;&gt; Shimi. &gt;&gt; David's leaving the city. his son Abselam's taking over the church causing a split and all kinds of things are David could have stayed THERE AND FOUGHT BUT he was a real man OF GOD HE SAID LET'S LEAVE LET'S GET OUT OF HERE WE DON'T WANT conflict Shimi took advantage of all that and such cursing and swearing and little did David know that 800 years after that the son of David sat on a hill that was the spirit of Christ in David somebody SAID HERE I'LL TAKE OFF HIS HEAD HE TALK ABOUT MY KING LIKE THAT AND DAVID said let him alone the Lord told him to do that. Little did we know years later, Brother Brandham was going to say the same thing in a tax case and under pressure in his HOME AND THEY'RE SPOOTING OFF. SOMEONE SAID, "OH, THE LAWYERS, THEY'RE THIS, THAT, AND AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, MAYBE THE LORD TOLD HIM to do that." &gt;&gt; SEE, HE BROUGHT THE WORD INTO HIS DAILY LIFE. IT WAS JUST AUTOMATIC &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS ON THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF INSTEAD OF JUST FIGHTING AND WAR. OH, that that attorney's not a believer. He's not a Christian. It doesn't matter. THAT'S NOT HOW HIS attitude was. &gt;&gt; He said, "I I TOLD MY WIFE TO LIE. IT WAS A WHITE LIE. TELL HIM I'M NOT HERE." IT WAS THE PRESSURE I WAS UNDER. &gt;&gt; Y'all remember brother Brandham's first wife that passed away and her dying deathbed. Can I say this? She's I have something to tell you. She's passing away. Tuberculosis up there in Charles Town and it's flooded out and everything and she's ready to pass away. The thing that comes to her mind is back something that happened way before when we were going up to some meetings and brother Brandham went out to buy some stockings for her rayon chiffon. Ranch chiffon rayon chiffon. What kind of you know do they like this tile? Do they like this? Is it socks? Is it this rayon chiffon? He goes into a place. My I they're so cheap. I'll just buy two pair. And he buys two pair and so proud of himself comes back, gives them to his wife. And and then he wondered why in the next town they that she had to go buy some new ones. And here she's BRINGING IT UP ALL ON HER DEATHBED. She said, "Forgive me, Bill. Those those stockings you got were for older women. Forgive me. So sensitive. So sensitive. just so sensitive in relationships. God, help us to be a leader in New Zealand &gt;&gt; of ending any type of wars or fight. You be the peacemaker. &gt;&gt; You be the person that says there's not going to be that. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be the person. I have this scripture here. But I'm just going to 2 Samuel 18 verse 4-1 17 if you'd like to write it down. This is when David's son was causing trouble in the church and in the message. He's rebellious. David, the king said unto them, "What seemth you best I will do?" And the king stood by the gates, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. And the king commanded Joab and Epici and saying, "Deal gently for my sake with the young men, even with Abselam." And all the people heard when the king gave all the CAPTAIN'S CHARGE. BE GOOD TO HIM. HE'S CAUSING A SPLIT IN HIS CHURCH. HE'S BREAKING UP THE FAMILY. And David said, "When you find him, be gentle with him. Verse 6, the people went out into the field against Israel. This is 2 Samuel 18:6. And there was a battle there. Verse 7. And the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David. And there was a ve a great slaughter that day of 20,000 believers, men, PEOPLE IN THE MESSAGE. 20,000 died in this war. Have I flooded your mind with too much today? There ought to have been somebody stand up in some camp, some meeting AND SAY, "STOP IT. PEOPLE ARE DYING. &gt;&gt; Look at the direction you're going." &gt;&gt; For the battle, verse eight, was their seed scattered over the face of all the country, and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. That is their environment that they were fighting in woods. They were fighting in in an atmosphere. They were fighting in Leodysia. Can I say it like that? AND THE WOOD DEVOURED MORE OF THE BELIEVERS THAN THE SWORD DID. IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF TO BEING WARLIKE AND FIGHTING, IT WILL DESTROY YOU. &gt;&gt; Let me find a place to get off. God, help us not to be a fighting people. Help us not to be a fighting congregation. &gt;&gt; Help us not to be fighting in our families. &gt;&gt; Superior pride and hottiness better than everyone else. That's not one of the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; You find when brother Brandham even with nature speaks better of that. When he was before the bull, &gt;&gt; it was love. &gt;&gt; He said something came over me. &gt;&gt; Do you all remember that? when when the all the hornets CAME OUT AND HE DROVE HIS LAWN MOWER. He's busy. He drove it into the hornets AND THEY ALL CAME BUZZING AROUND. HE HAD HIS SHIRT OFF CUZ IT WAS HOT THERE IN INDIANA AND THEY CAME and they're all coming around. He said, "I'm so sorry." He spoke. God speaks to nature. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON DIFFERENTLY THAN WHEN YOU WALKED IN THE ROOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT JUST HAPPENS WHEN IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT COMING ON YOU. IT'S LOVE COMING ON YOU. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT MANIAC, I WAS READING IT THIS MORNING, CAME UP ON THE PLATFORM. EVEN THE EVEN the policemen were afraid of him, HE CAME RUNNING UP ON THE PLATFORM AND WAS GOING TO TAKE BROTHER BRANDHAM OUT. And brother Brandham standing there and and the policemen were all there like deacons. Should we stop him? He said, just let him come. He wasn't afraid. He started thinking about maybe he has a family, MAYBE HE HAS A WIFE, MAYBE HE HAS CHILDREN. Something come over him. It was love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said before you knew it, that man fell over brother Brennham's feet like this and they asked, "Is he delivered?" HE'S NOT DELIVERED. HE worships that thing. &gt;&gt; GOD FORGIVE US IF WE WALK OUT OF THIS SERVICE AND START KEEP WORSHIPING THAT VIOLENT SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING IN A LAND OF VIOLENCE &gt;&gt; AND A young man just IN HIS IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS ROOM OR EVEN UH BROTHERS CAN GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS IN THE MESSAGE AND IT'S war games and killing them. And we have some of our ministers and older ones that have come up through the drug era through the 60s and you come ON MY BLOCK, YOU DO IT MY way or hit the next block, buddy. And that becomes THEIR LANGUAGE. THAT BECOMES HOW THEY TALK TO THE PEOPLE. You come into my city, you start another church, you do something different. I'm going to take you out. I'm going to destroy you. &gt;&gt; That's not the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't do that. &gt;&gt; Brother Ruddle had a CHURCH TWO MILES UP FROM THE Brandom Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; BROTHER JUNIOR JACKSON IS 5 MILES AWAY from the Brandom Tabernacle. UDICA WAS JUST VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THE BRHAM TABERNACLE. BROTHER BRANDHAM DEDICATED churches in Clarksville, spoke in Louisville, and he didn't feel intimidated. &gt;&gt; He said, "They come in here and empty this place out, well, we'll just keep preaching and fill it up again." &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T INTIMIDATED BY THESE BROTHERS. &gt;&gt; YET, some of us in THE MESSAGE, WE WE WOULD TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THEM. We would, YOU KNOW, THIS AND WE'D BUILD CASTLES. &gt;&gt; Tear down your castles. &gt;&gt; CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE. WE LOOK AT THE SAME Shemi if you want to look it up in first kings. David's passing away and he said there was three things he he wanted Solomon to deal with and one of them was Shimi. Take care of that that man in your church. He's trying to undermine you. That spirit will destroy the sheep. Cursing, swearing, taking advantage. Loud, boisterous. It's my way, brother. In church meetings. How many desire to come to this statue of a perfect man? I put that on the screen. Who desires to come to the statue? &gt;&gt; Just lift your hand up as a testimony to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Have y'all ever counted those? Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness. Number seven is brotherly kindness. That's le oysia. Say, BUT WE'RE IN THE BRIDE AGE. WE'VE COME FURTHER. ABSOLUTELY. BUT THE IT'S IT SHOULD BE GRACE AND LOVE CAPPING OFF OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; But how MANY ARE TRYING TO GO AND AVOID BROTHERLY KINDNESS? are trying to avoid brotherly kindness and they talk ABOUT LOVE, PREACH ABOUT LOVE, have a 10- part series on love, yet they're skipping around brotherly kindness. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THAT'S HONEY IN THE box &gt;&gt; and in blasphemous names. The sister THAT THAT WONDERED WHY THAT SHE WOULD GO TO MEETINGS AND THE WATER WAS BEING POURED INTO HER BOX AND IT WAS GOOD AND good services and good meetings, but it was just flowing right out. And it was just going right OUT AND WONDER WHY. I WONDER IF I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. I WONDER. And he said, "Sister, you just need honey in the box." &gt;&gt; And you POUR IN THE POUR IN THE WATER AND IT'LL IT'LL HOLD IT. &gt;&gt; Blasphemous names. Go read it. &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness is honey in the box. &gt;&gt; It's love MIXED DOWN INTO BROTHERLY KINDNESS. THAT'S THE THAT IS THE ANOINTING THAT WILL COMBAT THE AGE WE'RE LIVING IN. BUT THE BRIDE IS COMING UP HIGHER THAN THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT PERFECT LOVE WILL NEVER SETTLE DOWN UPON A LIFE THAT DOESN'T have brotherly kindness. Never. &gt;&gt; Can we all say never? &gt;&gt; Never. You can scream, shout, have loud music, have the best preachers. Brother Brandham could be your pastor, &gt;&gt; but if you don't have brotherly kindness, That love has nothing to settle on. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Has this been okay today? &gt;&gt; I'm winning to your afternoon and [applause] [applause] I begin to move from that beautiful joyful place. Brother Isaac and and musicians just in a few minutes I want you to come. As far as my eyes could see, people were coming towards me, embracing me, crying, my precious brother. Suddenly, I was back on the bed again beyond the curtain of time. I was back on the bed again. I said, "Oh God, help me. NEVER LET ME COMPROMISE WITH THE WORD. LET ME STAY STRAIGHT ON THE WORD. I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY else does, Lord. Let me press on to that beautiful, joyful place. This is what a supernatural experience does for an individual. IT CAUSES YOU TO LOOK INWARD. &gt;&gt; It's me, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS THE PROBLEM. It's me. Is it me, Lord? Let me press. The Lord, help me. I'm so convinced. I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place. There was no jealousy, no tiredness, no sickness, no old age, &gt;&gt; no death, only supreme beauty and joy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, lay aside everything else until you get perfect love. &gt;&gt; Get to where you can love everybody, even every enemy. No matter no matter if the plane is rocking, the lightning is flashing, or the guns of the enemy are upon you. These things do not matter. Get perfect love. You might BE IN A HORRIBLE RELATIONSHIP. YOU MIGHT BE IN A CHURCH THAT has been NASTY AND BAD. YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE LEAVING YOUR JOB OR GOING TO ANOTHER SCHOOL, AND I DON'T BLAME YOU. But the main thing is get perfect love. If you're not saved, accept Jesus Christ as your savior. &gt;&gt; Next Sunday, this afternoon, no. Now, &gt;&gt; just take him right there in YOUR SEAT THERE. JUST SAY, "LORD, FORGIVE ME. I'VE BEEN WRONG. &gt;&gt; TAKE AWAY FROM ME ANY ARROGANCY OR PRIDE. IF I'D BEEN GUILTY OF CAUSING TROUBLE FOR ANOTHER BROTHER, OH GOD, FORGIVE ME, LORD. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T REALIZE, SISTER, THAT IT WAS AFFECTING YOU LIKE THAT. Is brother Joel Brother Seth here today? Is Brother Seth here? &gt;&gt; Brother Seth. Brother Seth, can you come out for a second? I just want to demonstrate a little something. God bless you, brother Seth. You know, and then we need to speak to our young people and speak to one another like this. Brother Seth, if there's ever been anything that has happened while you're growing up, how old are you now? &gt;&gt; 20. &gt;&gt; 20. If there's ever been anything that has happened in your life that's offended you, I'm sorry. in your school, in your family, something at church, something in New Zealand, something you heard from America, anything that would offend your heart and just cause you to to have anguish in your spirit. I'm sorry. Maybe it was a girl. Maybe it was a boy. Maybe it's something that nobody knows about. Maybe it's become public. Maybe it's very public now and and you all know cuz you live in New Zealand. Brother John's far away. Maybe it was something on Youth Without Borders. If I said anything or if I called you out or something embarrassed you, I'm sorry. It's amazing, you know, that elder son of the prodical son, he was just as backsliden, paying ti, coming to church, had the good looks as the prodical son that was out there in the world going crazy and wild and spinning and going and going and going. Thank you, brother Seth. That older brother in the message should have been texting his brother, "Can I come see you? I'm sorry. My heart's getting hardened toward you. You breaking up our family. You're come. You've been raised in the message. You know better than this." AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HE NEEDED TO HEAR. &gt;&gt; He was just as lost, the elder son, &gt;&gt; cuz he was too good. The Lord's dealing in the service and telling the church that you all ought TO BE HAPPY AND REJOICE IN THE LORD. GOD'S RESTORING. GOD'S DOING THINGS and and he just, you know, has another spirit on him. Yet, he pays his tithe. He's really good. Has a nice clothes. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a sister and SHE'S DRESSING THE PART and doing the actions. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN JUST JUST BE AS BACKSLIDING AS ANOTHER PERSON THAT'S IN A VERY HORRIBLE DARK. They're both dark. &gt;&gt; A RELIGIOUS SPIRIT'S WORSE THAN A A SPIRIT THAT SAYS, "FORGET you all." &gt;&gt; I don't want to come to your meetings. I don't want to come and be around you anymore. You know, sometimes when a person talks to you and sorry, brother Isaac, we'll sing in a moment, but they'll talk to you and share something with you and talk about something and THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT they want to talk about. They're just testing. They're just seeing if you're going to be a friend. &gt;&gt; And then after about 35 minutes or so, when you think it's all done and you've agreed and yeah, that's that that's this certain way, then they kind of just say something. And that's what it was. And we need to be more sensitive to that. I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GO TO LUNCH in a few minutes. God bless you, brother. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH ISSUES AND THINGS, &gt;&gt; mental things right here among us mentally, &gt;&gt; and struggling. Brother Brandham would go right down the line and say, "You with cancer, you with a female trouble, you with a tumor, you this, and you sister behind." And there was my there this this would have been moved back like this, Brother David. And there would have been Cuts and stretchers and wheelchairs and young people with legs cut off and PEOPLE LAYING THERE JUST I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH AN HOUR, HOUR AND A HALF SERVICE, but I hope they call my number. I hope they call my my prayer. I hope they call my number. They're just about they're just going in and out of pain and suffering. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT TODAY. WE DON'T HAVE CLOTS AND STRETCHERS AND WHEELCHAIRS AND YOU GOT CANCER. You got tuberculosis. Oh, you sister back there, YOU GOT THIS IN YOUR IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S IT'S THINGS THAT ARE SO HIDDEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S IN ANOTHER REALM. &gt;&gt; WE'RE FIGHTING AGAINST POWERS AND DEMONIC SPIRITS. &gt;&gt; I SAY, GOD, IN THE NAME OF JESUS, &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT TAKES, LORD, WE NEED HELP. &gt;&gt; WE'RE CRYING OUT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; JESUS, WALK THROUGH OUR SERVICES. &gt;&gt; AND LET THE HYMN AND THE BORDER OF YOUR GARMENT, I DON'T EVEN NEED TO TALK TO YOU, PREACHER. JUST LET ME TOUCH THE HEM OF YOUR GARMENT. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S LOOKING FOR MEN AND WOMEN THAT HAVE THAT MUCH POWER IN THEM. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T. BROTHER JONATHAN AND I DON'T HAVE A lot of time. We haven't even spent hardly any time together. AND THERE'S JUST A WALL IN BETWEEN US. HE KNOWS THAT. AND I DON'T AND I know that. &gt;&gt; But the Lord knows everything about every single person. How many believe that? Your name, your address, YOUR ISSUES. WE MIGHT HAVE WENT AN HOUR AND A HALF SERVICE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S JUST SOMETHING GOD'S GOING TO DROP DOWN IN YOUR HEART AND IT'S LIKE A KEY TURNING IN THE lock &gt;&gt; and you LEAVE THAT SERVICE. YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT WAS ON THE SCREEN, BUT ALL YOU KNOW IS GOD CARES. &gt;&gt; GOD CARES FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; HE LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; No one's got a gun to your head. No one's going to offer you drugs this afternoon. Nobody wants to have sex with you outside of marriage. No one's breaking into your dorm. We're not offering you cigarettes. Come on, friends. Let's Let's CLOSE THE SERVICE. NOBODY'S TRYING TO TAKE YOU TO HELL. &gt;&gt; NOBODY IN THIS ROOM WANTS SOMEBODY ELSE HERE TO GO TO HELL &gt;&gt; AND TO HEAR YOUR VOICE IN THE REGIONS OF THE LOST. &gt;&gt; NOBODY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; In fact, if all of you were somebody somebody here missed the rapture and you were on the other side and we were believers and we were part of the bride and you walked up, I WOULD SAY GIVE HIM GRACE. &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM MERCY. &gt;&gt; CAN SOMEBODY SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; OR ARE YOU SO HARDENED AGAINST THAT BROTHER, SISTER, THAT OTHER YOUNG PERSON YOU TALK BAD AND NASTY? DON'T DO THAT TODAY. &gt;&gt; HAVE ENOUGH HOLY GHOST ABOUT YOU TO TO JUST ZIP THE LIP. &gt;&gt; BE QUIET. BE SILENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, &gt;&gt; we're all guilty. &gt;&gt; We overt talk one another. We We're not We JUST DON'T EVEN CARE. We'll go a whole weekend like this. And not even listen to somebody else, not even be burdened, &gt;&gt; not even hardly pray. SOMETIMES WE JUST GET CAUGHT up in the food. or I didn't sleep good. Somebody didn't look at me good. I hope next year they have another TYPE OF SPEAKER. THAT'S ALL FINE. &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETIMES WE JUST NEED THE MEDICINE. &gt;&gt; We need a scalpel. WE NEED THE WORD TO COME DOWN ON THE INSIDE AND START MOVING AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND GO DOWN INTO THAT PLACE AND THEN CUT AROUND THAT ARTERY AND MOVE INTO THAT DELICATE SPOT AND BRING OUT THE CANCER, BRING OUT THAT CERTAIN TUMOR. And every single person HERE, IF YOU HAD A LOVED ONE THAT WAS GOING THROUGH A SENSITIVE OPERATION, a heart transplant, I DON'T CARE IF IT WAS 8 HOURS, &gt;&gt; you'd be sitting in that waiting room praying, &gt;&gt; DESIRING, SAYING, "GOD, GUIDE THE HANDS OF THE PHYSICIAN, BE WITH THE NURSE, AND WHY CAN'T WE SPEND AN HOUR, TWO HOURS, AND IN PRAYER AND AND MEDITATION AND SAYING, GOD, YOU'RE DOING SURGERY ON somebody &gt;&gt; that I'm GOING TO SIT HERE AND WAIT UPON YOU IF YOU DON'T TALK TO ME THIS WHOLE WEEKEND. &gt;&gt; I come for you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I come for my brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; I come to let you have your way. &gt;&gt; I come to be grace. So, if you'll give them grace then, why don't you give them grace now? &gt;&gt; If somebody would come at the white throne judgment and you're a son and daughter of God, the bride, the saints will judge the earth. Somebody come and stand in front of you and you know them. There should be love and grace and say, "Lord, they were my neighbor. THEY WERE AT THAT FAMILY CAMP WITH ME. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry you missed THE RAP. I'M SORRY YOU MISSED IT. HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THAT, BROTHER?" BUT LORD, LORD, COULD YOU GIVE THEM GRACE? &gt;&gt; I'm stretching out there FOR YOU TODAY. BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. WE'RE NOT AT THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. TODAY IS THE DAY TO RECEIVE YOUR GRACE. TODAY IS THE DAY FOR US TO PULL YOU ONTO THIS OTHER SIDE AND SAY, "WHY WOULD YOU WAIT? WHY WOULD YOU REJECT? WHY WOULD YOU LET YOUR HEART BECOME HARDENED &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE DECEITFULNESS OF SIN?" &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE DAY TO RISE UP INTO THAT STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN AND SAY, "BE IT unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless the technical team. &gt;&gt; God bless all the cleaners. &gt;&gt; I shook hands with the head chef TODAY AND I BLESSED HIM. HE'S HE'S NOT A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; He's from lineage is from India and in that area, but he's from New Zealand. I talked to him a little bit. I I spent minutes with him this morning. I could have been in my room. I was there just I I wanted to come and just see some of you. Went went on a run, exercised a little bit, came back, came down, got my wife a coffee. Okay, get her a coffee. Got a little porridge, talked to some people, shook hands, have a wonderful day. But if you notice, it's always positive. is never negative, always good, THINKING OF YOUR GOOD. THAT'S OUR HEAVENLY FATHER. &gt;&gt; I PRAY THE HOLY SPIRIT BAPTIZE THIS CAMP WITH SO MUCH OF HIS PERFECT LOVE. IT WOULD JUST BE milky in here. JUST BROTHERLY KINDNESS, SISTERLY kindness [applause] to where even our little children, WE CAME OUT OF THE PRAYER TIME THIS MORNING. THERE WAS ONE OF YOUR LITTLE BOYS DOWN on his knees and there was a great big bug, great big bug crawling. I said, "Man, YOU GOING TO EAT THAT THING?" I was connecting with him. &gt;&gt; One of the young men was riding his scooter around and said, "I better not ride on that scooter. I'd probably break it. I weigh too much. God, give us Christlike character. &gt;&gt; The trials that we're going through can either make us in a certain way. We get all twisted up and carry it or we can just say, "Lord, may the character of Christ flow through me." &gt;&gt; We all have trials. I'm quoting your prophet in the church age book. We all have trials. We're all tried and chasened. No one but goes through that. The church that's not suffering is not being tried and hasn't got it. It isn't of God. My precious New Zealand brothers and sisters, may God give you a new heart, &gt;&gt; a new spirit, and give you his spirit. I'm not saying you don't have it. I'm just saying I want more of it. &gt;&gt; If you'd asked BROTHER JOHN TODAY, "WHAT'S my greatest desire?" It would be more of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Say, "You're just too simple." Well, then back to simplicity again. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; I pray the Holy Spirit would just come at the close of this meeting. &gt;&gt; I think it was forecasted to be rainy this morning and the sun was shining. Lord, I pray the Holy Ghost sun would shine upon these people. As we pray and as we go into our lunchtime and begin to fellowship, this is our only Sunday afternoon that we're going to have a Shikina Tabernacles family camp. Heavenly Father, we want this nature of Christ above all things. The world has nothing for us. I'm asking for forgiveness of myself publicly if I have offended or hurt any of your sheep or your people. I was walking down the road today and I had to examine my own life. No civil war. We have to look inward and say, "H have I been guilty of this or of that?" We have to be able to take the looking glass and say, 'Lord, let your word be first partaking in my life. How could I ever say that to the people if if war is going on inside of me? Lord, let us be men and women and just let things go. Let us not bear grudges and have to get back at someone. And if what brother John said is true, and it is, that God's people are not warlike, that they're people of peace, if we've lent that, leaned that way in our lives and and and even influenced other people in our family or in our churches, forgive us, Lord. If there's one person that we've ever caused to take a stutter step after hearing something we've said or looking at one of our texts or our emails or just a side remark, it wasn't really a compliment to what you were doing in the meetings. It wasn't really in line with what the spirit would say to the church. Then would you forgive us? Kind heavenly father, would you put it under the blood and let the bleach take care of the chemicals? If it's a wrong spirit, if it's a wrong complex, if we are harboring, if we are harboring spirits and nurturing things that are not of you, forgive us. Forgive us of our sins and forgive us our debts as we forgive those that trespass against us. and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet today. God bless you. Let's give praise to God in worship. Hallelujah. [cheering] [applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Y'all did so good earlier. Why don't you shake hands with somebody and hug their neck as our musicians come and if you're able to do that. Amen. Shake hands and God bless you, brother. God bless you, sister. God bless you. Appreciate you, too. Thank you very much. Hallelujah. Yeah. Hallelujah. I'm sparing you from doing it before your your lunch. Amen. So, shake hands with somebody. Hallelujah. We're going to sing this song. Feel my way. Is that the song or we change it? &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. She wrote the same song down. Isn't that incredible? Brother Isaac wanted, "Let's sing this certain song." And it's a certain way. And I said, "Okay, let's sing that." Our sister over there said she had written it already in a text. Let's sing this song. There it is. Same song. &gt;&gt; What's that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Not to me, but she didn't text me. &gt;&gt; Was she texting during church? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Oh, just delete that from the tape. What's that? &gt;&gt; It's a text to herself. &gt;&gt; Oh, she texted herself. Okay. Wow. Speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns. Okay. I got a verse for that. Amen. Hallelujah. Okay. Let's sing this and then we're going to go and have a wonderful afternoon. &gt;&gt; Let me walk blessed Lord in the way that has gone. Leading straight to the land above. &gt;&gt; Giving cheer everywhere to the sad and the lone. Fill my way every day with love. Fill my way every day with love. As I walk through the hill, let me go for a while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day [music] with love. Keep me close to the side [music] of my savior and guide. Let me never end on darkness. [music] My heart right there in my soul. Satisfy my [music] love. As I walk, [music and singing] let me go all the while with a song [music and singing] and smile. The race will be over [music] and I'll in my home [music] my [music] away every day with my [music] go with a song and a [music] smile. Feel my way [singing] every day with love. I'll build my way [singing] every day with [music] love. As I walk through the heavenly love, [music] let me know all the while with a song [music] and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Hallelujah. We are a people of peace. &gt;&gt; No more civil war. &gt;&gt; No more bad attitudes towards one another. It ain't worth it. &gt;&gt; It ain't worth it holding any grudge, resentment, hatred. You're not built to carry those things. You're built to carry joy, peace, love, gentleness, meekness, temperance. That's what you're built to carry. &gt;&gt; Let's let's just let the past be the past. Let's move on in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who wants that honey in the box? Who wants that brotherly kindness? &gt;&gt; Amen. Where you just, you know, it's supernatural [music] where you see anyone, you just have a love for them. Amen. That's what we're built to have. That's what we're built to possess. That's what the message came to give us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful for that. Aren't you? God built you to be like that. Amen. I'm so glad. You know, I I think when I hear that was a master. Thank you, brother John. Thank you so much. Thank you. [applause] Amen. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. We need to hear We need to hear messages like this. We can't we can't be built to keep fighting someone else's war. &gt;&gt; And we're called to break the cycle. &gt;&gt; To break the cycle. &gt;&gt; So it's not just peace, then war, then peace, then war, then peace, then war. It's just the war's gone. It's ended. Now it's peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're built to break that cycle. &gt;&gt; So why not? Let's walk in peace. You know, there's a scripture. Yeah. We we talk about it. I was just thinking about so much during the service how [music] David would write in the Psalms, "Blessed are the brethren that dwell in unity." It's like the anointing oil that runs off Aaron's bed. Without that anointing oil, Aaron could not have gone into the Holy of Holies with the blood. He could never fulfill his office without that anointing oil. I tell you what, friends, we cannot fulfill our office as the bride of Jesus Christ without unity. &gt;&gt; So, let's just let the war go. You said, "This is all I've known." Say, "Lord, change my thinking. Change my speech as we heard this morning. Change my outlook towards one another." We all want to see each other on the other side. [music] &gt;&gt; So, let's live like it as we heard this morning. I'm not saying, you know, let's just encourage one another. Let's not let's not any negative thing come out of these lips, dwell in these hearts. May it all be positive towards one another. We're all the family of God. Thank God we live in a season of peace. And thank God I believe God has determined like it was a warning. We heard a warning. &gt;&gt; Don't go back into it. Don't go back into those old ways of fighting. Let's keep walking in peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. May this country, the believers around this country be known as a peaceful people where there's such a unity. There's not church boundaries and territories and those kind. just we're all one family where it's just a family reunion where we see one another and we and we appreciate Christ and one another and we appreciate how we're built differently. Amen. So let's pray. [music] I I just want to say thank you Lord for this morning. Thank you Lord for speaking to me. Thank you Lord for sending a a warning. We don't need to go there. Let's move on. Like the apostle uh Paul would say, forgetting the things which are in the past. Let's leave it in the past. Let's walk on in divine love. Amen. [music] So, let's bow our heads this morning. Gracious father. Oh, hallelujah, Lord. Lord, we want divine love, but Lord, we need brotherly kindness for it to rest on. Oh, God. May we have that may just be flowing out of our lives. brotherly kindness, a real care and concern, and a real a real hunger, Lord, to see one another do better and walk with you and love you more. And just may we have that heart for one another, dear God. Because, Lord Jesus, as we heard this morning, we don't just want to talk about divine love. We don't just want to talk about brotherly kindness and these things. We want to see it live. What's the good of talking about it if it don't live, Lord? We want to see that manifest in our lives like never before. So, Father, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, may you take your word which we heard this morning, may you anchor it into our hearts, Lord. May it bring forth a hundfold. Dear God, if we've been fighters, if we've just been had an attitude against one another, against another church, or Lord, may that be done. We don't want to cause collateral damage. Lord, we don't want any damage. Oh God, we want to call a stop to these things now in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray, Father, that this this day would be a a mark on the calendar where it was an end of any civil war, any remnants of it or attitudes or things that have been hanging up, oh God. May that just be done under your blood, Lord. [music] And may we now be in a complete season of peace, oh God, that your divine love can flow through all of us, Lord. No matter how old or young, no matter who we are, Lord Jesus, that brotherly kindness, that divine love of yours would flow through us, oh God. May you grant it, Lord. That's what we desire more than anything, Lord. [music] So grant it, Lord. We love you so much. We thank you for the service, Lord. Forgive us of our sins and our wrongs, dear God. As we heard this morning, we're all guilty, Lord. I place myself there, too, dear God. Oh, God. Wash us clean, Lord. Renew us, Lord. I pray. We thank you so much. We ask your blessings upon us, Lord. May dismiss us with your blessings, too. And as we go into the go into the lunch, go into the afternoon, Lord. May the this atmosphere go with us, oh God. Grant it, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. [music] Sorry. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name. [music] Take the love of the Lord with you. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] Heat.
