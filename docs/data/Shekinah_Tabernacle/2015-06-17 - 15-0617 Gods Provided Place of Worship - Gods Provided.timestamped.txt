[26:15] I mean let's just go to jus Tirana me
[26:18] will just read from chapter 16 will read
[26:20] from verse 1 and it says this it says
[26:23] observe the month of of a burb which is
[26:27] April and keep the Passover unto the
[26:29] Lord thy God from the month of ever the
[26:33] LORD thy God brought the forth out of
[26:35] Egypt by night thou shall therefore
[26:37] sacrifice to pass over unto the lord thy
[26:40] god of the flock and the hood and the
[26:41] place which the lord shall choose to
[26:45] place his name there that's very
[26:47] important to us thou shalt not eat no
[26:50] unleavened bread with it seven days
[26:52] shalt thou eat unleavened bread there in
[26:54] even the bread of affliction for the
[26:56] hour cometh forth out of the land of
[26:58] Egypt and hast that thou mayst remember
[27:00] the day when now come as fourth of the
[27:03] land
[27:04] Egypt all the days of their life and
[27:06] there shall be no living bread seen with
[27:09] thee and although Co seven days neither
[27:11] shall there be anything of the flesh
[27:13] which are sacrificed sacrificed the
[27:17] first day at even remain all night until
[27:20] the morning thou may us not sacrifice
[27:23] the Passover within any of thy gates
[27:25] which the LORD thy God giveth thee but
[27:28] at the place which the LORD thy God
[27:29] shall choose to place his name in there
[27:32] shall they'll sacrifice the Passover
[27:35] even at the going down of the Sun at the
[27:38] season that thou cometh forth out of
[27:41] Egypt and thou shalt roast and eat in
[27:43] the place which a lot of thy God shall
[27:44] choose and thou shalt turn in the
[27:46] morning and go into their tents six days
[27:49] shalt thou eat unleavened bread and on
[27:51] the seventh day shall be a solemn
[27:52] assembly for the Lord thy God thou shalt
[27:55] do no work there and I mean let's just
[27:58] pray together get Lord Jesus father we
[28:02] want to worship you and obey Lord not
[28:04] out of not out of rules but out of love
[28:07] father what you've done for us Lord with
[28:09] Lord we know that Lord we could live a
[28:11] million lifetimes and we could live
[28:13] every one for you but it would never
[28:15] repay the love debt we owe to you or God
[28:17] for what you've done for us and butter
[28:18] because when we could not go to where
[28:20] you were lured you came down to us O
[28:22] Lord you reach down your hand to us
[28:24] father and I'm so thankful you came that
[28:26] day to me Lord and father we just pray
[28:28] as we look into your word now father may
[28:31] you just come Lord you're the author of
[28:33] your work and father were so thankful
[28:35] that this what we just read it was
[28:37] written many thousands of years ago but
[28:38] it's still alive and fresh today as his
[28:41] first Moses pinned it down and father i
[28:43] pray you just come and speak out Lord
[28:45] speak out of your word to us I pray
[28:47] speak every heart O God and father may
[28:49] you just cause us to have a closer walk
[28:51] with thee O Lord and father we love you
[28:53] we thank you it can be gathered here in
[28:55] the middle of the week and father I just
[28:56] pray the busyness of maybe what we have
[28:58] to do tomorrow would just be laid aside
[29:00] Lord and we just sit here Lord and we
[29:02] just Lord we just rejoice and let off
[29:04] the pressure in your presence oh god
[29:05] please may you grant it father may you
[29:07] receive all the glory and honor and
[29:09] praise Lord because you deserve it all
[29:11] Lord and we love you and thank you in
[29:13] Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean you may
[29:16] you may be seated
[29:18] now I'd like to speak tonight I thought
[29:20] you know so so Melanie your your
[29:23] question is not forgotten we will get
[29:25] there don't worry it's not forgotten but
[29:27] I felt from last just from a week ago I
[29:30] felt to speak upon this and we have a
[29:33] very interesting piece of scripture here
[29:35] because God is declaring in a place
[29:37] where he puts his name that is that is
[29:40] God's chosen place of worship and we so
[29:44] we want to worship God where he has
[29:46] chosen us to worship because if we
[29:48] worship Him where is not chosen us to
[29:50] worship it's in vain and so it's a very
[29:54] critical thing even though the book of
[29:56] Deuteronomy who was written thousands of
[29:58] years ago we know this is the old
[29:59] testament some would say it's just
[30:01] history but everything God has written
[30:03] to us is for a purpose and he is giving
[30:05] instruction here that we would
[30:07] understand that there's a place that is
[30:09] provided by God and there's a provided
[30:12] place of worship that we must go and
[30:14] worship God in and I'm sure you're all
[30:16] familiar with the sermon by the ramp
[30:18] reached on God's chosen God's only
[30:20] chosen provided place of worship and
[30:22] it's going to go into the scripture and
[30:23] look into this now we have here we have
[30:26] Moses instructing the people where God
[30:28] says the place where I put my name
[30:30] that's where you worship do not worship
[30:32] anywhere else do not worship in your
[30:35] gates we just redo not worshipping your
[30:37] gate worship in the place where I have
[30:39] put my name and we will look into the
[30:42] scripture and we will see that that is
[30:44] not a geographical location like it was
[30:46] in the old testament but that place is
[30:48] available to everyone who'll come God's
[30:51] provided away and that place is not
[30:53] actually a location but it is a person
[30:56] and that is because God put his name and
[31:00] his son Jesus Christ and we'll go
[31:02] through the scripture and see this but
[31:03] so it's vital because he said do not
[31:06] worship and in any of your gates so you
[31:08] were instructed do not worship anywhere
[31:10] with this man's religion do not do not
[31:13] worship anywhere that is not of me and
[31:15] we know the only place provided can be
[31:17] the truth of God's Word because this is
[31:19] God in print form and we can see we you
[31:23] know we won't read it but if but if
[31:24] maybe a bit of homework you can go to
[31:26] first Kings chapter 12 and and there's
[31:28] an account there of Jeroboam and what
[31:30] happens is jira bombers
[31:32] as has given 10 10 of the 12 tribes what
[31:35] happens is God takes takes the kingdom
[31:38] from from Solomon the majority of it
[31:41] from his son and he gives 10 10 tribes
[31:44] to Jeroboam which was Solomon's enemy
[31:46] and two tribes were reserved for
[31:48] Solomon's son and what happens now is
[31:50] Jeroboam he he he he does not have
[31:54] Jerusalem the the ten tribes he has does
[31:56] not have Jerusalem and at that day once
[31:59] here that got to Jerusalem to worship
[32:01] because of that day that was God's
[32:02] provided place of worship that is where
[32:05] the temple was that's where the Ark of
[32:07] the Covenant was and God instructed
[32:09] Moses at the high priest once a year
[32:11] would go into the Holy of Holies where
[32:13] the Ark of the Covenant was with the
[32:15] blood and if the high priest was
[32:17] accepted that sacrifice was accepted
[32:18] then the sins of the people were
[32:20] forgiven them it was that it was that
[32:22] essential you know they they they had
[32:25] their Levites where they live they had
[32:27] their they would sacrifice where they
[32:28] lived as well but if that sacrifice
[32:30] wasn't accepted it was all in vain so
[32:33] they had to go once a year up to
[32:35] Jerusalem and they had to observe this
[32:37] time when the high priest winning with
[32:38] the blood and he he was afraid that if
[32:42] the people would go to Jerusalem then
[32:44] their hearts would be turned turned to
[32:46] his enemy because at that time Israel
[32:48] was divided it was civil war so he
[32:50] devised the plan that he would he
[32:52] wrecked two golden cuffs and he would
[32:54] put one in Bethel and one and Dan and he
[32:56] told the people it's too hard for you to
[32:58] go all the way to Jerusalem just go
[32:59] worship there so what happened now has
[33:02] he turned the people from God's provided
[33:04] place of worship and he made man-made
[33:06] places of worship and and they were
[33:08] turned into them and if you keep reading
[33:10] the book of kings and second Kings you
[33:12] know it's his cinder bombs sin of making
[33:15] the these two golden cuffs that was
[33:17] always remembered and it was always held
[33:19] against them and that I'd all just
[33:22] worship that man-made religion that came
[33:24] in there you know it causes rayul do to
[33:27] go down because they were not
[33:29] worshipping and God's provided place of
[33:31] worship because if they worship and gods
[33:33] provide a place of worship then
[33:35] everything God said they would would
[33:37] would receive forgiveness of sins living
[33:41] with God living among them the
[33:43] supernatural power to drive out every
[33:45] enemy
[33:45] the you know to actually have fellowship
[33:47] with God if they worship God said
[33:49] worship in this place they would receive
[33:51] that but if they worship somewhere else
[33:53] they would not receive that and that is
[33:55] why Israel came into a cold formula
[33:57] state where where the scribes and
[34:00] Pharisees were just arguing debating and
[34:02] learning the scripture and all these
[34:03] things they had no power of God with
[34:05] them they only had they said we have
[34:07] Moses if they really had Moses they
[34:09] would have had the god of Moses they
[34:11] would have had that same supernatural
[34:13] God but they didn't have them because
[34:15] all they had was a form and you know
[34:17] jesus said you you tithe and menton and
[34:21] cumin and anise and all these things but
[34:23] you've laid aside the weightier matters
[34:24] of the law judgment & mercy and faith
[34:27] these things you ought to have done what
[34:30] had happened they had laid aside the
[34:31] more important things yeah why because
[34:33] they weren't worshipping God's provided
[34:35] place anymore and so that's why it is
[34:39] vital because it's still the same today
[34:41] because man does not change history just
[34:45] repeats itself and if we can see the
[34:47] mistakes of the past we can avoid them
[34:50] today because we're just that man is
[34:53] just as susceptible to to to go the
[34:56] wrong way today as he was then because
[34:59] they knew the scripture they knew the
[35:01] scripture better than we do you know
[35:03] this a is a story like the scribes and
[35:07] Pharisees those who really really read
[35:09] the Old Testament apparently they could
[35:11] they could because of the scrolls they
[35:13] could wind up the scroll and they could
[35:15] put a pin through that Torah and they
[35:17] could actually tell you every letter
[35:19] every every jot and tittle that it would
[35:22] pierce through that's how well they just
[35:24] knew it written out now there's not a
[35:27] person here you pick up a Bible you roll
[35:30] it up you put something through it
[35:31] that'd be us excuse the pun a stab in
[35:34] the duck you wouldn't know where it goes
[35:36] through hey they could recite it from
[35:38] Genesis all the way to Malachi they
[35:39] could recite it perfect amazing amen so
[35:44] they knew the lid of it pretty good but
[35:46] that did not help them move but they
[35:49] still move from God's provided place of
[35:52] worship so now we will go I just want to
[35:55] let us go to Malachi chapter 3 we're
[35:58] just going to read a few scriptures
[35:59] and I'm just going to come down and just
[36:01] show you I just thought I'd tell you
[36:02] from the very GetGo that God's provided
[36:05] place of worship and this day is being
[36:07] in Christ that is it that is God's
[36:10] provided place of worship it's not a
[36:12] building it's not a denomination it's
[36:15] not a system of religion but it's being
[36:16] in Christ and if you're in Christ you
[36:19] are in God's provided place of worship
[36:22] so it's a very important things we just
[36:25] got to malachi chapter three and we'll
[36:28] read this verse one from I'm and Matthew
[36:30] are going to go back a bit because i
[36:32] want to show you and and i'm sure we
[36:34] have already gone through this but it's
[36:36] important to see that that that jehovah
[36:38] of the old testament became Jesus of the
[36:40] new it's not to God's not too different
[36:42] gods revealing themselves as the same
[36:45] God all the way down through the
[36:46] scripture and so that's why what he said
[36:49] in John I'm in Deuteronomy that we read
[36:51] applies today because if he put that on
[36:54] Israel then and he's the same God he'll
[36:56] put it on us today so Malachi 3 and
[36:59] verse 1 it says behold I'll send my
[37:01] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[37:03] before me and the Lord whom you seek
[37:05] shall suddenly come to his temple even
[37:07] the messenger of the Covenant whom you
[37:09] delight and behold he shall come saith
[37:12] the lord of hosts but who may abide the
[37:15] day of his coming and who shall stand
[37:17] when he appeareth for he is like a
[37:19] refiners fire and a full of soap and so
[37:23] now what we have is this this messenger
[37:26] he says there that the angel of the
[37:28] Covenant will suddenly come to his
[37:29] temple and Malachi is telling them there
[37:33] that they actually delight in this one
[37:35] and we understand that this messenger of
[37:37] the Covenant was the angel of the Lord
[37:39] that led Israel out of Egypt into the
[37:41] Promised Land this was the one who
[37:43] appeared as a pillar of fire by night
[37:45] and a cloud by day and here saying now
[37:47] that he will send one before one before
[37:50] him that will prepare the way and then
[37:52] this very God that they believed then
[37:54] would suddenly come down into his temple
[37:56] and he would become known to them and we
[38:00] understand from reading from Isaiah that
[38:03] that there be a voice of one crying in
[38:04] the wilderness to prepare the way of the
[38:06] Lord and that one that was the voice
[38:08] crying in the wilderness is the same one
[38:10] here that is the messenger too and he
[38:13] prepare the way before me and we
[38:15] understand from the scripture that was
[38:16] John the Baptist he had a ministry to
[38:19] introduce the people to the messenger of
[38:21] the Covenant he was he had the ministry
[38:24] to introduce Jehovah God to the people
[38:26] and so and he looked out his commission
[38:30] and there came a day where there there
[38:32] was a man who stood among them yo John
[38:34] was so sure of his commission he says
[38:35] he's standing among you now and he would
[38:38] begin to tell the priests and the
[38:39] Pharisees that the daily sacrifices
[38:41] daniel said would be done away with and
[38:44] and he began to one day he looked out
[38:46] over the crowd and he saw one as his
[38:49] behold he comes the Lamb of God that
[38:50] takes away the sin of the world here
[38:52] comes the man that will do away with the
[38:54] daily sacrifice and he pointed out this
[38:56] one he says he says I'll known because
[38:58] the Spirit of God will descend upon him
[39:00] and abide upon him only John saw that
[39:02] supernatural manifestation but when
[39:05] Jesus went into the water there and he
[39:07] was baptized said the heavens were
[39:09] opened and the Spirit of God like a dub
[39:11] descended upon him and as a voice came
[39:13] out of the heaven saying behold this is
[39:15] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[39:17] and this scripture was being fulfilled
[39:19] right in front of them because Jesus
[39:21] spoke of his body is the temple amen so
[39:25] that scripture was fulfilled right in
[39:27] front of them so that that that great
[39:29] pillar of fire that being that spoke to
[39:31] Moses out of the burning bush that one
[39:34] who who appeared you know he said Moses
[39:37] said to him I want to see you and God
[39:40] said to him you can't see me but just
[39:41] just my back parts and put him on the
[39:44] cleft of the rock and he passed by him
[39:46] and all the supernatural you know
[39:48] splendour on these things and Moses said
[39:50] I just saw the back parts of a man that
[39:52] one was now in a body of flesh and he
[39:55] came down to the body of flesh because
[39:57] the daily sacrifice had to be done away
[39:59] with because we understand from the
[40:01] scripture that the blood of bulls and
[40:03] goats could not change a man it just
[40:05] covers the Sun and they would go out
[40:06] with the same signaled sinful desire so
[40:09] I had to come a day where God would undo
[40:11] that son curse and a man and actually
[40:13] give them a heart of faith that one day
[40:15] they would stumble and fall of things
[40:17] that maybe were passed out from their
[40:19] family but then one day God would come
[40:21] and purge that man out and God would
[40:23] come and dwell in that man and they
[40:24] wouldn't be overcome by this sinful
[40:26] wish any more halloo I'm so glad for
[40:29] that so now we have the serg's asst says
[40:32] he says in John 5 and verse 43 he says I
[40:35] come in my father's name but you
[40:37] received me not and the angel Gabriel
[40:40] told Mary you shall call his name Jesus
[40:42] for he shall take it he shall save his
[40:44] people from their sin and in those days
[40:47] people didn't have surnames they just
[40:49] had one name behold your name is Simon
[40:52] you know Simon bar Jonah Simon son of
[40:55] Jonah he was just called Simon they only
[40:57] had one name and so if jesus said I come
[41:01] in my father's name and you receive me
[41:02] not that means now that the name of the
[41:05] Father is Jesus Amen because the very
[41:09] name Jesus means Jehovah Savior so now
[41:12] here was God's salvation being
[41:14] manifested in flesh and also Paul would
[41:17] begin to say in Ephesians 3 that the
[41:19] whole family in heaven on earth is
[41:21] called Jesus amen the believers because
[41:25] the believer takes on their saviors name
[41:27] as a as a woman takes on the husband's
[41:30] name when they are married so was the
[41:32] Bride of Christ when we are united with
[41:34] with our Lord Jesus we take on his name
[41:36] I mean that's why the whole family in
[41:39] heaven and earth is called Jesus so we
[41:42] understand that when God said there is a
[41:44] provided place of worship that I will I
[41:46] will give you access to and I will put
[41:49] my name in that place he's saying that
[41:51] in him as that provided place of worship
[41:54] and him as that place where you can
[41:56] truly worship me and spirit and truth
[41:58] amen are we thankful that we have access
[42:01] to that provided place because Cain and
[42:04] Abel they they both approach God and we
[42:07] can see all the way down through the
[42:08] scripture that it was blood blood had to
[42:10] be shared a life had to be given that
[42:12] man and God could have fellowship
[42:14] together and we see Abel there he had a
[42:16] revelation it was blood and he offered a
[42:19] lamb and that lamb was just a pre figure
[42:21] of the lamb to come Annie Annie
[42:23] sacrifice at lamb and God accepted a
[42:25] sacrifice amen he was at that time in
[42:28] God's provided place of worship because
[42:31] it was revealed to him the lamb had to
[42:32] die that he could go free and it's been
[42:36] all the way down that's way that's why
[42:38] Moses when he gave the Lord
[42:39] you must offer this sin offering and
[42:41] this is the trespass offering and this
[42:43] is you know all these different
[42:44] offerings and they were all a shadow
[42:47] pointing to the offering that would come
[42:48] which is Jesus Christ and we read from
[42:51] the book of Hebrews Paul is trying to
[42:53] get these Hebrew believers to to show
[42:55] them what you have now is greater in
[42:58] Christ than it was in the old testament
[42:59] the sacrifice of christ is greater it
[43:02] has more power in it it is more
[43:04] effective you know Paul would tell them
[43:06] that by one offering he has perfected
[43:09] them forever that are sanctified so they
[43:12] didn't you know Paul would begin to lay
[43:14] out he didn't have to give us blood
[43:16] every year like the high priest would
[43:17] take the blood and didn't have to offer
[43:19] it one more time it was done once and
[43:21] forever was settled and so he was trying
[43:24] to get these Hebrew people to be your
[43:26] lifted up out of there you know they
[43:28] came out of they came out of following
[43:31] the law as their fathers did but they
[43:34] are in that middle ground from coming
[43:36] out of their old religion and coming
[43:37] fully into Christ and that's why he
[43:40] would Paul where I say let us go on let
[43:41] us go on from what we have and in the
[43:44] end of the book of Hebrews he says let
[43:45] us go beyond the camp I mean let us go
[43:48] unto him beyond the camp amen so he was
[43:51] telling him we must go on and he said
[43:54] that because of one time the provider
[43:57] place of worship was what they did but
[44:00] because the lamb came when Jesus died on
[44:02] Calvary hey the day before that happened
[44:04] the lamb that was given their outer
[44:06] sincere heart that was an effect that
[44:08] blood was in effect but then when he
[44:10] shed his blood upon the earth that
[44:11] matter how many lambs the worshipers
[44:13] would bring it doesn't do any good
[44:15] because God had moves his provided place
[44:18] of worship and now was in the Sun and we
[44:21] understand that the blood of bulls and
[44:23] goats could only cover sin it could not
[44:24] truly bring man and God back into
[44:26] fellowship like God wanted us to be
[44:29] because we're sinners God cannot dwell
[44:31] you know we we see in the Old Testament
[44:33] when winner when someone came down with
[44:36] leprosy you read you read there in the
[44:38] days of Moses a leprous person could not
[44:41] even be within the camp where they are
[44:43] you know Tabernacle in the wilderness
[44:44] was in the middle and the tribes were
[44:46] situated around the outside someone with
[44:49] leprosy couldn't even be among the
[44:50] people they had to be outside of the
[44:52] camp
[44:52] and it shows how God when when sin is
[44:55] present how much actually separates a
[44:57] person from the presence of God and the
[45:01] blood of bulls and goats could only just
[45:02] cover that Senate could not actually
[45:04] bring man into the fellowship that Adam
[45:06] and Eve had before the fall that could
[45:08] not do it because it was animal life it
[45:11] was a lower kind of life that was shed
[45:12] we understand animals do not have souls
[45:15] they you know you go back however many
[45:19] thousands of years in a chimpanzees a
[45:21] chimpanzee then he still does the same
[45:22] things today a dog back then Ursula dog
[45:25] today they do exactly the same thing you
[45:27] know some birds will migrate up to
[45:29] Siberia then they'll come back down to
[45:31] New Zealand and they'll go back up to
[45:32] Siberia again it's just an endless cycle
[45:34] because they're governed by a law that's
[45:36] in them they can't learn a bit away it's
[45:38] just them that's what they do but a man
[45:41] is different but because we have a soul
[45:44] that's why man has always been you know
[45:46] studying and learning how to how to how
[45:48] to improve their society and improve
[45:51] their technology is because they have a
[45:53] soul on them as different kind of life
[45:55] so animal life could not come back on
[45:57] the worship her and change that
[45:59] worshipper so that's why God had to
[46:01] become as a man and when when when John
[46:04] pointed about as the Lamb of God he says
[46:05] here comes the Sun offering I mean they
[46:08] can take away the sin of the world and
[46:10] we understand that when the life because
[46:12] it's not if I had a vial of Jesus's
[46:15] blood it would be a priceless thing but
[46:17] it's only the chemical aspect of the
[46:20] blood it's the life that was in that
[46:22] blood which is more important because
[46:24] that those cells were just matter that
[46:27] came out of the earth and they would
[46:28] decay go back into the earth of olive
[46:30] oil because did things rot you following
[46:33] me if I just had evolved it but the life
[46:35] and that blood went when that blood cell
[46:38] was released sat down Calvary the life
[46:40] that was in him now was released onto
[46:42] the worshiper amen that that that life
[46:45] would burn out that sin nature and every
[46:47] man who would believe every woman that
[46:49] would believe and it would make them a
[46:50] new creature a new creation in Christ
[46:53] Jesus hallelujah because when Paul is
[46:56] saying that we are new creatures or you
[46:58] look at that word is as your new
[46:59] creation that's not the old creation
[47:01] patched up a believer is not a patched
[47:04] up you know just a model
[47:06] one thing new creation completely
[47:09] hallelujah we are new crap we've been
[47:11] made over I mean the old me you don't
[47:14] even know the old me I'm so glad you
[47:16] don't know that guy he's a scallywag
[47:18] praise the Lord amen but we are new
[47:21] creatures we are new creations
[47:23] hallelujah why because the life that was
[47:26] in the blood that that hang on Calvary
[47:28] comes into you and changes you and now
[47:31] because that blood is shed because
[47:33] without the shedding of blood Paul says
[47:35] there is no remission of sin there is no
[47:37] ability approach to God to have
[47:39] fellowship so now the blood has been
[47:41] shed and when we accept that blood by
[47:44] faith and the life that was in that
[47:46] blood comes into you it throws you into
[47:48] unity with God that God and man becomes
[47:51] one unit again just like Adam and evil
[47:54] one unit and the garden it makes man who
[47:57] serve a will that will come and makes
[47:59] them one that's why Paul says in the
[48:01] book of Ephesians great is the mystery
[48:03] you know speaking of of he speaks of the
[48:06] husband and the wife he says great as
[48:08] that mystery speaking of Christ and His
[48:10] Church that too would become one flesh
[48:15] amen so when the life is released into
[48:18] you you become one yes amen so now you
[48:22] are in God's provided place of worship
[48:25] amen hey the priests were anointed they
[48:27] are anointed with oil to symbolize the
[48:29] Holy Spirit God's / coming upon them
[48:32] amen is the same thing with us we're not
[48:34] just anointed all as a symbol but what
[48:37] that was pointing to the life of God
[48:38] coming and dwelling in the believer now
[48:40] we are walking because when you're
[48:43] sealed into that provided place of
[48:45] worship you cannot leave that provide a
[48:46] place of worship Amen because you're
[48:48] walking in the spirit of god amens now
[48:54] let's go to Romans chapter 8 we just
[49:01] read a couple of scriptures here hey if
[49:04] we know that's why it's not a
[49:06] denomination that's not knowing some
[49:09] doctrine does not have some some kind of
[49:11] teaching or you know God did not put his
[49:13] name in the Baptist gate on the
[49:16] methodist gate on the Catholic gate he
[49:19] put his name in geez
[49:20] is Christ and if you're in him then you
[49:22] can only worship God before you actually
[49:24] become one with him you're just
[49:25] believing unto a man until the day he
[49:28] comes and receives your faith and you
[49:31] know he's received your faith because he
[49:33] comes and lives in you how do you know
[49:35] you receive because you have met him
[49:38] amen that's how you know you received so
[49:41] it says here now so let's read here
[49:44] let's read eight and we'll read verse
[49:48] start from Romans 8 will reave in verse
[49:50] 8 it says so then they that are in the
[49:54] and the flesh cannot please God say that
[49:57] walk after the flesh cannot please God
[49:59] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[50:00] spirit and if so be that the Spirit of
[50:03] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[50:05] the spirit of crises none of us and if
[50:08] Christ being you the body is dead
[50:09] because of sin but the spirit is life
[50:12] unto righteousness pardon me but if the
[50:14] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[50:16] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[50:18] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[50:20] your mortal bodies by a spur that
[50:22] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we're
[50:25] not debtors I mean we are dead is not to
[50:27] the flesh to live after the flesh but if
[50:30] you live after the flesh you shall die
[50:32] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[50:34] the deeds of the flesh you shall live
[50:38] for as many as a lead of the Spirit of
[50:41] God they are the sons of God for you
[50:43] have not received the spirit of bondage
[50:45] again to fear but you have received the
[50:48] spirit of adoption by you cry ever
[50:50] father for the spirit itself beareth
[50:52] witness with our spirit that we are the
[50:55] children of God and if children then
[50:58] heirs is of God and joint heirs with
[51:00] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[51:02] we may also be glorified together so
[51:07] what he's saying here now is that if you
[51:09] have see if Christ be in you he says
[51:13] your your natural man is dead and then
[51:18] he says if you have the spirit home the
[51:19] raised up Jesus I'm dead he'll also
[51:21] quicken that Saints real quick it'll
[51:23] make a life change your mortal body why
[51:26] is that because you are end God's
[51:28] provided place of worship yeah
[51:32] Alleluia and that's why I says do not
[51:35] live after the flesh he says he says if
[51:38] we threw the spirit mortify the deeds of
[51:40] the body we shall live what does that
[51:43] mean that doesn't mean physically you
[51:44] get up and say body you're dead all
[51:45] nature you did and you try and work
[51:47] yourself into it no but there's a law of
[51:51] faith that if you believe it will cause
[51:54] this flesh to come into subjection to
[51:57] the spirit that's within you amen that's
[52:02] why I say it's not about trying to stay
[52:04] because you know I remember I was
[52:06] driving to a Christian campuses not even
[52:09] in the message but another one and thus
[52:11] and one of my sister's friends driving
[52:13] and I and I said to them you know
[52:15] there's a place that God has placed his
[52:17] name when we must worship Him she's
[52:19] driving along as he turns around and
[52:20] looks me right in the eye she's driving
[52:22] like a hundred case on the road you know
[52:24] she's like where's you know she's also
[52:25] caught up where is that because people
[52:28] want to be able to do something where
[52:31] can I go what mountain cannot climb
[52:32] where can I go seek something in my own
[52:34] strength yeah but we're not called to do
[52:37] that we call to lay ourselves upon the
[52:39] altar and let him do it amen to help so
[52:43] it's not us that it's like Lord if I can
[52:44] stay in that provided place he keeps you
[52:46] in that provided place if you reckon
[52:48] yourself dead you'll stand that provide
[52:50] a place of worship and and we know that
[52:52] we have God's provided place of worship
[52:54] because we have the true interpretation
[52:56] to this because jesus said by teaching
[52:59] the commandments and doctors have meant
[53:00] to the scribes and Pharisees it says the
[53:02] Word of God you make the Word of God no
[53:04] effect so because they made their own
[53:08] place of worship just like Jeroboam made
[53:10] the calves so it doesn't have to be a
[53:12] big Idol like a big buddha in a place
[53:15] how do people craft idols they take
[53:18] scripture and they take things and they
[53:21] and they craft it all together remember
[53:23] god's word interprets itself you don't
[53:26] need to add any interpretation you just
[53:27] take the scripture and align up from
[53:29] Genesis to Revelation yeah so but then
[53:34] if people take scriptures they build
[53:35] scriptures and all these things see I
[53:37] could I could go to Deuteronomy and I
[53:39] could build an idol and say we must keep
[53:41] feasts and we must keep New Moon's we
[53:44] must keep Sabbath's and
[53:45] you know every mouth should be
[53:46] circumcised up to eight days old we
[53:48] should wear the things in dual you know
[53:49] what is that that's making an idol it's
[53:52] not rightly dividing the word of truth
[53:54] and if you do that you have your own
[53:57] provided place of worship but if you had
[53:59] the truth of the word then you have
[54:02] God's provided place of worship yep is
[54:05] that all right so now Jesus as I said
[54:11] Jesus and Jesus is his word now I'm just
[54:17] going to wrap it up a little bit now I
[54:18] was going to bring it all together if i
[54:19] Ken but Jesus isn't John 1 it says in
[54:22] the beginning was the word and the Word
[54:23] was with God and the Word was God and
[54:25] the same was in the beginning with God
[54:27] and all things were made by him and
[54:29] without him was not anything made that
[54:31] was made as his in him was life and the
[54:34] life was the light of men and the light
[54:36] shine earth and darkness and the
[54:37] darkness comprehended not he then he
[54:39] begins to speak out about John the
[54:41] Baptist so saying that this word that
[54:43] was with God and was God by this word
[54:46] everything was made and then Paul picks
[54:48] it up and it and he says in Ephesians I
[54:51] think it's chapter 3 that Jesus Christ
[54:52] made the world's it wasn't the man the
[54:55] man of Galilee but it was before he
[54:58] became flesh because we read here in
[54:59] Perth in John chapter 1 verse 14 and
[55:02] that same word became flesh and dwelt
[55:04] among us so that same God that led
[55:06] Israel into you know out of Egypt into
[55:09] the Promised Land became flesh and that
[55:12] man Jesus Christ and and he did that now
[55:17] because in the old testament that was
[55:19] God's provided place of worship bring
[55:21] the offering here's the priest here's
[55:23] the altar here's the high priest you
[55:25] know and they had to come that way but
[55:27] then David speaks of Melchizedek and he
[55:31] says that Jesus he didn't know him as
[55:33] Jesus then he said this one shall be
[55:35] made after the order of Melchizedek and
[55:37] then a male kids Aquino met Abraham
[55:40] after Abraham rescued lot from the Kings
[55:43] the purpose is going this way and then
[55:46] he he knew who he was because Abraham a
[55:50] few chapters later in Genesis chapter 18
[55:52] when he saw the same one come to him but
[55:55] in a body of flesh he said Lord I'm ever
[55:57] meal with me he
[55:59] actually recognize that was God came
[56:00] down and spoke to him God came down to
[56:02] flesh and had a meal with him and then
[56:04] nothing else is mentioned now of
[56:07] Melchizedek until we come down to Paul
[56:10] there in the book of Hebrews and he says
[56:12] this Melchizedek it says without
[56:14] beginning of days without end of life
[56:16] without father or mother you know
[56:18] without the scent and all these things
[56:20] you know he's saying that Jesus now was
[56:23] made up the order of Melchizedek Annie
[56:25] any identifies us as Melchizedek as an
[56:28] eternal being yep without mother father
[56:31] beginning of days end of life who's that
[56:32] someone eternal who's eternal God yep so
[56:36] Paul was saying that this Jesus now was
[56:38] a high priest after that order as an
[56:40] eternal high priest so Jesus is there in
[56:43] the days of his flesh and and they went
[56:46] to the temple and then and and and his
[56:49] disciples now because in those days that
[56:52] temple was God's provide a place of
[56:54] worship yep and his disciples said look
[56:57] how goodly these stones are and that
[57:00] same jesus said no don't you know that
[57:02] not one stone will remain atop another
[57:04] nellis fulfilled went on the days of
[57:06] Titus they burnt the whole place took
[57:09] out all the stones to get the gold out
[57:10] that that that melted in between but now
[57:12] here's a man so beforehand there was a
[57:15] temple and there was a high priest it
[57:17] was blood three separate things yep now
[57:22] here comes a man who is the temple he
[57:25] spoke of his body's a temple Jesus
[57:26] Christ and him was the blood and he was
[57:29] the high priests I mean because he could
[57:32] only in the Old Testament type the high
[57:34] priest took the blood into the Holy of
[57:35] Holies and that symbolizes the people
[57:37] were forgiven but now he took his own
[57:40] blood that's why he's hit the Mary don't
[57:42] touch me because I having ascended yet
[57:44] and then afterwards he ascended he came
[57:46] back daddy said now touched me Thomas
[57:49] touched me touched the wounds and all
[57:50] these things failed me so now here's the
[57:53] high priest now he takes us he takes his
[57:56] blood into the presence of God and
[57:58] that's accepted and then we know it's
[58:00] accepted because of their Pentecost that
[58:02] same spirit came down and dwells and the
[58:04] people member he is the word in the
[58:07] beginning was the word so now here's the
[58:10] Word made flesh and he took his blood
[58:12] to the presence of God him it is a
[58:15] provider place of worship and then he
[58:18] comes back down and then Peter stands up
[58:21] full of that same spirit and he begins
[58:23] to tell the people how they get into
[58:25] that provided place of worship because
[58:27] he said this is that spoken by the
[58:29] Prophet Joel he because they preach this
[58:31] is that I'll pour my spirit out upon all
[58:33] flesh he begins and then they say had
[58:36] away because he he preaching in such a
[58:38] way he said you're guilty you killed
[58:41] your own Messiah his bloods on your head
[58:43] he just preached it as her as he could
[58:46] and so now now they say hey we're busted
[58:49] we're guilty hey we're condemned how
[58:52] could I get this off how can I get it
[58:53] off my conscience off my hands whatever
[58:55] you want to put it he says now because
[58:58] remember without the shedding of blood
[58:59] is no remission of sins yeah so how do
[59:03] you receive because the blood the Bloods
[59:05] dried on the ground it was done 50 days
[59:08] ago his body's not even the tumor you
[59:11] know he's ascended so they can't go
[59:14] physically and get the blood and try and
[59:15] apply it to themselves yeah so how do
[59:18] they how do they receive this blood to
[59:20] get the remission of sin you know how do
[59:23] they do it and then Peter just tell some
[59:24] real simple repent be baptized name of
[59:27] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[59:29] and you shall receive the gift of the
[59:30] Holy Ghost you shall come into God's
[59:33] provided place of worship hallelujah and
[59:35] they received it in their own gods
[59:37] provide a place of worship amen oh it's
[59:40] pretty simple isn't it hallelujah but
[59:42] that was God's provided hey was that
[59:44] there was a certain channel that the
[59:46] people had to walk through the Old
[59:47] Testament they had to get a lamb had to
[59:50] be a certain age you know when they when
[59:52] they did the you know the we read about
[59:54] the Passover had to be a certain animal
[59:57] had to be without blemish they had to
[1:00:00] keep it up for a certain amount of days
[1:00:01] and then they had to kill it and they
[1:00:03] had to apply the blood they do all
[1:00:04] certain think and they said if you do
[1:00:06] these things in the death angel will
[1:00:08] pass over you there was a provided place
[1:00:11] provided channel or way to to be covered
[1:00:16] by the blood that they would be free
[1:00:18] from the wrath that would fall upon
[1:00:19] Egypt and then we read there in
[1:00:21] Deuteronomy that they shall eat
[1:00:23] unleavened bread seven days and that is
[1:00:25] showing you the unleavened
[1:00:26] read it because living and the scripture
[1:00:29] is sin and Jesus said man shall not live
[1:00:33] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:00:35] proceeds out of the mouth of God so he's
[1:00:37] actually saying this unleavened bread
[1:00:38] you must keep as you must eat the word
[1:00:41] become one with the word but that would
[1:00:43] must not be living by man's ideas
[1:00:45] because of us it's living with men's
[1:00:48] ideas you've done what your Obama's done
[1:00:50] you made a golden calf and you can't go
[1:00:53] to Jerusalem anymore and receive what
[1:00:54] Jerusalem has amen hallelujah so Peter
[1:01:02] gave the instructions and those people
[1:01:04] went into God's provide a place of
[1:01:05] worship amen we have received the
[1:01:08] instructions that I know nearly eight
[1:01:10] years ago I went into God's provide a
[1:01:12] place of worship Alleluia and I've been
[1:01:14] stuck in there ever since amen i
[1:01:17] wouldn't want to leave and you can't
[1:01:18] leave because if you're sealed in not
[1:01:20] just anointed but sealed into the
[1:01:22] kingdom I mean you're stuck in God's
[1:01:24] provided place of worship because it's a
[1:01:27] person where I said it he is the word
[1:01:29] Peter gave them the word and the people
[1:01:33] that receive as many as believe will
[1:01:34] baptize yes Amen hallelujah praise the
[1:01:40] Lord queer see musicians a man we are in
[1:01:43] God's provide a place of worship thank
[1:01:45] you lose same it's not complicated as
[1:01:47] many as believed it was revealed to them
[1:01:51] they were baptized amen and they just
[1:01:54] walk in it that's right hey I'm glad
[1:01:58] aren't you thankful yeah we don't
[1:02:01] worshiping some gate that's why I say
[1:02:03] the name of this building this buildings
[1:02:04] are relevant it's not about the building
[1:02:07] it's not about the name doesn't matter
[1:02:08] what church you go does not about the
[1:02:10] church is about the people i mean and
[1:02:12] their relationship with God Alleluia and
[1:02:15] you know what I love about it is we
[1:02:18] didn't go because some people you know
[1:02:20] people make movies about finding some
[1:02:22] rare flower on the top of the Himalayas
[1:02:24] and and and curing some disease and
[1:02:27] doing all these things and they and they
[1:02:28] spend years trying to study things and
[1:02:30] you know there's a group of professors
[1:02:32] at at Canterbury University and they
[1:02:35] would look into natural products to try
[1:02:37] and cure cancer they went down they
[1:02:39] dived off
[1:02:40] or go these sea sponges and they did all
[1:02:42] these kinds of things trying to find
[1:02:44] something that can cure a sickness now
[1:02:46] we didn't go find it it found us I mean
[1:02:50] God's provide a place of worship found
[1:02:51] you allu you Amy that just changes
[1:02:55] everything to me hallelujah amen we're
[1:03:00] in God's provided place where I put my
[1:03:02] name Amen and the name of God is Jesus
[1:03:07] the Lord Jesus Christ amen alleluia amen
[1:03:16] let's just go to this has got number 8
[1:03:19] in your presence that's right I'm strong
[1:03:21] I mean do you love him tonight wait
[1:03:24] that's why you know look at the
[1:03:26] scripture we're not I I price that all
[1:03:29] the time but I trust us thank you no
[1:03:31] we're not just a church we're not just
[1:03:34] Christian people you know we're not just
[1:03:36] wear you out but with a blood bought
[1:03:38] redeem ones of God don't let the devil
[1:03:41] or ever tried twisted from you saying
[1:03:44] you that doesn't belong to you you know
[1:03:47] we can go into the scripture maybe to
[1:03:50] null do it the way to the Tree of Life
[1:03:52] all the way to God's provide a place of
[1:03:55] worship has always been guarded you read
[1:03:57] Genesis more that flaming sword of the
[1:04:00] cherubim was put there not to protect
[1:04:02] the tree of life to protect the way to
[1:04:06] the Tree of Life
[1:04:09] so it was it's being guarded because I
[1:04:12] said same chair members come all the way
[1:04:13] down through the scripture to protect
[1:04:16] the way so some people feel like
[1:04:20] security security let some people look
[1:04:22] security doesn't let other people in
[1:04:25] yeah and once upon a time that chair of
[1:04:29] them was guarding the way to keep people
[1:04:31] out but now it is actually causing
[1:04:34] driving people back into the tree of
[1:04:37] life and that tree of life is Christ you
[1:04:40] say how does that work one day God begin
[1:04:43] to tag on your heart and you begin to be
[1:04:46] influenced by an unseen realm and you
[1:04:48] couldn't what maybe couldn't put it in
[1:04:50] words but maybe I just put it in words
