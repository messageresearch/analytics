walk in the light of the world Amen god bless religions thank you brother Jeremy's brother Jeremy's birthday happy birthday amen it's great to have all the visitors here to God bless you amen wow just you feel welcome god bless you amen just I'm not feeling too good to just pray for me but um let's just go to the scripture so I don't have a slide show today this go to Genesis chapter 2 piece of familiar scripture here Genesis 2 and we'll read from verse 20 just picking up from where I kind of left off last Sunday this is here Genesis 2 and 20 and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slipped and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of men therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh Amen let's go to first Corinthians 13 I will read one one scripture from first Corinthians 13 we're gonna read verse 12 and then we're gonna go to 1st Peter 5 and then we'll finish there and so I first went in 13 verse 12 for now for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known so come a time when we ate we know as we are known so as God knows us we shall know in the same way Amen let's go to 1st Peter 5 as well and we're gonna read from verse 6 first beat a five and verse six will refrain verse five of SB to five likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder you all be subject one to another and be clothed clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and give us grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking and to whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us under his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen I mean this is Bauer he's in a word of Prayer gracious Lord father feel very insufficient to be standing here Lord this morning but lord I just pray you come and meet the expectation of every heart Lord I ask that you'll speak to everyone dear God just Lord us want to get myself out of the way Lord that you can accomplish that which you have purpose for the service Lord may you have your way among us dear God I ask father that you'll just anoint speaker and hearer Lord fathers what good would it be for the hero to be anointed or not the speaker or or the other way around what good it be to be anointed speaker and not anointed hero so anoint all of us father may your word find prepared ground and every heart Lord to bring forth a hundredfold Lord we just want to commit the service into your hands Lord we are so you'd have preeminence in every life Lord may you grant it please and Jesus Christ name Amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning and I want to continue on well I call that pearl so we'll call it pearls part two but I want to speak about God's masterpiece in the seventh seal now we know that the seventh seal is a person who does Jesus Christ and hears he has come you know upon the earth two together a bride for himself and we understand that everything that the Lord has made he's made it for a purpose you know he didn't just make this earth just to see if he could make it he made it for a purpose you know he made the Sun not just to see if he could make the Sun but the Sun has a purpose every asteroid has a purpose every planet has a purpose every bug has a purpose every animal has a purpose upon the earth God all bacteria has a purpose amen to everything that God made there's a purpose in it being made and he didn't just make it just to see if he could make something a mint but he had a purpose in making it and is the same with you I mean we have a purpose we and we understand that that purpose is not just to be a person I mean it's not just to go through life and have children and you know have a job and a career even though that is part of it but that is not the purpose we are here but we are here upon the earth that God's Word would find a little boat in our soul and he had manifest himself through us I mean that we would be a living conduit of his power and glory I mean that is that is why we're here I mean I trust you have come to that realization you know you didn't just come into the message haphazardly I mean God ordained your footsteps he knew how old you'd be he knew the situation in life you'd be and I mean but he and he preordained a season where he would meet you hallelujah and he did it for a purpose now brother Brahim says in the greatest battle ever fought he says and I thought of the order of that heavenly hosts so speaking of the Stars not one of them's out of place everyone's kept its time perfectly God's great army I thought of the soldiers how that if the moon would happen to get out of order the earth would be covered with water just in a few minutes the earth would be just like it was when God decided to use a to have here on it it was without form and void and darkness and water was on the Britt's of the earth earth and if that moon would ever move it would do the same again when the moon rocks a little away from the earth the tides come up and when it goes down it just follows the tides it's God's great army and when I thought of that being God's great army there now I went to bed and when I begin to think that not one of those get out of their place they all sit in place if there's a moving anywhere out of them it'll cause that will affect this earth we just see the effects of it now from some of their moving into other spots it's effective it affects everything and I thought then if that great heavenly host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the heavenly host what about when one of us gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the Spirit and I would to God this morning that we would bring this to a real healing service that we would keep this part this group that we have gathered under the roof this morning and such a harmony that the holy holy spirit would place every member of the body here this morning in such harmony till there be a spontaneous healing of soul and body F we'll just hold our positions hallelujah and he says and I and he says and as I said at the beginning this lady that had cancer that dr. Holbrook was going to take off now that God that just caused the fluttering noise to come into the coming to that clinic and that cancer without even leaving a scar didn't know don't you know that that same God's here the only thing he is waiting for us to get his army to get to position like the Stars get to position Amen think of the power of that where you know if we could just get in one mind one heart one Accord he says there be a spontaneous healing of soul and body hallelujah many times people could dwell on the negative of people getting out of order but I think we should dwell on the positive people getting in position I mean how much more powerful win went God's great army you think about God's incredible masterpiece other people that all have their own opinion they all have their own personality they all have their own ambition but yet they've surrendered their well completely to the Lord and then God moves them into harmony with us word hallelujah and with one another I mean that that that the whole Ransome body of God can move as one unit can move as one great army hallelujah don't you want to be part of that number amen so I think it's very powerful if we recognize that we are called for a purpose now Jesus would know I think I'll just jump to this quickly you know and I'll come back but you know this is just from I just took a bit from brother Dottie Reagan's sermon or from the Easter youth came about we need power and he brought out in there that the devil knows that he has power he knows his position let's go to let's go to Luke 4 let's just read a bit but it's a different kind of power than what we have but I want you to recognize that the devil knows has he knows his boundaries he knows his position he knows his authority and he's not afraid to use it he does not shrink back you know I'm not worthy to be Satan today no he just takes what he is and he just uses it to its full extent that he's allowed to use it I meant let's go to look for he says here to Jesus now notice this here look for an and and verse 5 and the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed and to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I I will give it if thou wilt if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine now notice Jesus does notice what Jesus is that jesus answered said unto him get thee behind me Satan for his written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve so he doesn't say no you're a liar Satan no you have no right to you have no power to give the kingdoms of the world to me he did not he did not tell him he actually was actually agreeing yes you have this power but this power is not the power that we're in dude when the Holy Ghost comes upon us but this powers are designated it's a sense of ability it's a privilege it's a delegated influence it's a jurisdiction amen so it's actually a it's a it's a delegated influence he's allowed this position right so so so the devil knows his position the devil knows his place and he is not afraid to operate from that place he's very willing he's very able he doesn't shrink back but when it comes to us how different it is to us where we shrink back and we and we take a step back when the devil starts to intimidate us and and and get on our case and challenge us how we shrink back too many times we should never be afraid of the devil's devices we should never be worried about what he's doing I mean because how God has made us greater than the devil I mean we are not a servant angels we know a servants right but we are family we are sons and daughters and when you take a natural you know a natural monarchy I mean the children of the king and queen have greater authority than even the best servant in the kingdom because the the servants not family right but they but the children are family amen but the devil always tries to punch it who we are and challenge who we are we shouldn't shrink back if God has made us thus we have us hallelujah if he's made me the bride I am the bride I can't help being the bride the moon can't help being the moon Satan can't help being sent on earth can't help being earth you know they can't help but the Sun can't help being the Sun because God made it thus I'm in a you know a blue Wow can't help being a blue well it'll do what blue whales do because it's made a blue whale hallelujah and if we are the sons and daughters of God I mean we can't if we just give our will to the Lord we do not try and pick it back up again then we will not be able to help being the bride I mean you can't build it because you made thus hallelujah so the devil he knows his position do you know yours amen we're here too we have to recognize the power in the body Alleluia the absolute power that is that is part of you know don't get nervous when I talk about these things because always get worried do I have the ability do I have the right to stand on my god-given privileges absolutely have the right amen you know if I gave you you know I know if I use the illustration before but you know if someone gave to you some some Island and you know some some some little paradise island somewhere tropical island he says it's yours would you go claim it you wouldn't be afraid you'll be oh I'm not worthy I'm poor I'm richer you know I can't you know no you would you would you would get there he would take possession of what belong to you what was given amen how much more yeah but but we wouldn't look in ourselves and say well am i worthy to live on that island no you just go get it wouldn't you well how much more now eternal life how much more the power of God amen how much more him dwelling in us how much more us coming to our position hallelujah Amen a if the Lord said that we shall knows we are knowing now we're living in that day I remember we we need to stop looking at ourselves by our perception what I think of myself doesn't matter Amen now what he thinks of me is the only opinion that matters amen but how much power does when people walk in harmony you you notice the children of Israel I mean when they when they cross the Jordan into the Promised Land they were moving as one body I mean they believe the land was theirs and when as long as they were walking in step with the promise they didn't lose a man they won every victory God supernaturally came down and conquered their enemies for them amen and that's just a shadow of you Allu you know it's Esau yo in Psalms 133 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity amen it's like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the the beard even Aaron's beard I mean that went down to the skirts of his garments so you know David or whoever wrote the psalm is saying this is what unity does because had to be anointed with the anointing oil in order to to exercise the office of high priest I'm in here to be anointed in order to go in and and go to the Holy of Holies and offer the blood on behalf of the people and he's saying this is what unity is like you can actually the body can actually function as it's meant to function hallelujah amen and so how you know we are we have a function we have an office to to exercise like the high priest he had a job right he had a job he was ordained to that job hallelujah we're ordained to a job amen now we're it well we didn't but I mentioned last last last Sunday how Rebecca was found by a well outside the promised land but then she was taken by Eleazar into the Promised Land and Isaac was dwelling in the South Country and he came from the way of the well of llaha Rory and there in the Eventide Isaac and Rebecca came together so now Rebecca was going to live by different well hallelujah it wasn't a well where she is from it was a different well and the name llaha Rory that means it's it's the well of a living one my seer the well of him that liveth and see if me amen to the well the well that she came to was in the promised land now our promised land is Christ right and we do not have a well that just trickles I mean that you know we don't have a well that has stopped up in every season maybe in the winter it flows in the summer is dry I mean that's not the world we have we have a well of living water that gushes forth hallelujah and as Jesus would say he met a woman at the well and this was a Jacob's Well but he was going to introduce her to another well and that well was living water I will give unto the living water not just natural water but living water and she begins to say well sir thou has nothing to draw with the well is deep whence hast thou living water are there greater than our Father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle and jesus answered unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life hallelujah and we know the rest of the conversation where you know he said go get your husband and and and he know she said well I have them then he says your that's right you've had six and the one you I mean you've had five the one you worth is not even yours you know and then he revealed to her that he was the Messiah it changed the whole life now she was now she was manifesting a different water a mint now was flowing from her a different kind of life hallelujah amen and it's the same thing it's exactly the same thing with us so yeah I just want to we're here for a purpose that God would flow that its word would manifest itself I mean but more than just an anointing that comes and goes but an abiding presence I mean with God your God us in Isaiah heaven is my throne earth is my footstool but where is the place of my rest he's saying I made all things but where's a place I can rest hallelujah I made the solar system I made the galaxies I made everything but where is the place of my rest and your response should be Here I am because the human soul is the place of God's rest said Lord here's a place you can take your rest I mean here's a place where you can make your abode amen hallelujah that's what we are we are the place of his rest Amen but he is now but if we're the place of his rest I say he's not just asleep he's living he's working hallelujah he's affecting those around us amen so now he season so Jesus so Rebecca was living by different well and now we begin to live by different well I mean we don't we're you know we're not drinking from some stagnated pull that gets common or get stupid or bugs growing at your brother and preaches yo bro consistence he goes that Jeremiah says that they have forsaken their forsaken me you know Springs of the Living God and have hewn themselves out cisterns amen we don't have a system we don't have a man-made tank that everything from the world just gets washed into it and then we have a spring of living water hallelujah the water we have flows out it doesn't flow in and sense I mean it flows out hallelujah there's a force behind and that's flowing out hallelujah trust that's every one of you there's a life pulsating for bezu there's a there's something pushing hallelujah I trust that's you and your life order I know yeah I'm not saying well do you have to feel on cloud nine every yo all day no I'm not meaning that but there should be a life that's flowing there should be a force like Brother Bear master you know well he didn't ask the stream buddy see no he came to a stream hunting and it was it was bubbling and he said well if I could ask mr. stream at say mr. stream why are you why are you guessing forced is it because the deer comes at drinks roost and the industry would say no is it cuz the foxes or whatever come and drink this is no this is why because it's something pushing there's something pushing out hallelujah and it should be the same thing with you and I this should be a life that's flowing Allu you Amen because you can't contain God you can't contain the word I mean man through the ages has tried to put him in a box he just says you can't box me you can't box me in I just keep growing I keep moving hallelujah so it's gonna be the same this should be a life that's pushing forth Jesus came it says in John 7 the last day of the great feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this he spake of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified and he's is fairly fairly this isn't John so wait we'll just leave that be seized now he that believeth on me out of his belly shall flow living water there'll be a life that's flowing forth now you know when water is flowing it brings refreshment you know it quenches our thirst amen water your grandma's trying hard become soft life can come forth hallelujah that's living water amen it should be the same thing with you and I if God because remember we are his resting place his word now he he is his word there comes and dwells in us to flow forth hallelujah I mean it's not just you know we memorize a bunch of quotes and scriptures that's not it he has a being he comes and dwells in you and then his life manifests through you hallelujah that you become a lively stone of living stone built into the temple of God I mean we have a Living God we serve a living God not just the man's ideas or some some convention of a religion no we serve a living God and he wants to use you and me to manifest himself upon the earth that's what the brightest for hallelujah we are his body upon the earth I mean we're not here just to debate and argue and have some kind of lifestyle no that's not what the message is the messages of the Living God comes into a living people and manifests his Living Word hallelujah that's what you're called to be that's why you're called to be now never ever let the devil try and push you back from that cuz that's your god-given right you have your god-given privilege and writers that God would live in you and God would manifest himself through you and that you would know him hallelujah that he wouldn't be a distant Jesus Christ is alive he is the same yesterday today and forever and he is present he doesn't just want to be with you why did he come upon the earth in his flesh he didn't just want to be with his disciples he wanted to be in his disciples hallelujah that's the same thing with you and I he doesn't just want to be with you our God's here no he wants to be in you he wants to come and dwell in your soul hallelujah I'm glad that's the case aren't you hallelujah but never ever let the devil said you can't never obtain to that because the devil he thinks you have to earn it look at all his religions people go on pilgrimages and they crawl up steps and they say how merry so they rub feet of statues they do all kinds of crazy things cause it's man trying to obtain something we're not here to obtain something we're here to give ourselves to him and then he takes us a mean and transforms us into the image of his word amen you know we had a we had a company conference you know and one of the keynote keynote speakers was says you know you've got to transform yourself I thought my no because I'll end up disappointed at me if I try and I'll turn over a new leaf it just turns back again all my good intentions just get thrown away you know I thought man no God has to do the transforming Allu yeah now so out of now Jesus season in John 14 14 and 12 he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works I do shall he do also and greater than these shall he do because he because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it so he is making a declaration he that believeth on him the works that I do shall he do also now let's just let's just think about that for a second what works did he do he cast out Satan he raised the dead he healed the sick I mean he restored the sight of the blind he opened people's understandings to who they really were right but the greater works is the impartation of eternal life amen that we can actually impart eternal life to others amen Peter went to Cornelius house now God always works for his body Peter Peter is you know he's in Joppa and he's praying or you know he falls into his a trance and he sees the other sheet with all the unclean animals you know and God says go slay and eat and all those things I think God says to me you know don't call what I've called clean unclean and then some men and then an angel before that go yo speaks to Cornelius who's a Gentile and and you know the angel says to me Oh your arms have come up before God now therefore go send men to Joppa you'll find Simon you'll find Simon Peter amen and he'll tell you the words of eternal life so then so then they go under expectation the men go to cut young you know go get Peter and then he comes Peter and then you know he begins to speak about the resurrection and how Jesus Christ is alive what God is doing in their day and while yet Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them they received eternal life what happens through the body turtle life was imparted hallelujah he say well I'm not a preacher you don't have to be a preacher to give eternal life I meant every part of the body every part of the body is ordained to cast out devils to to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover to speak in new tongues all those things that we've been designated I mean that's every part of the body amen hallelujah I mean we should look into our equipment bag and dig out some things and start putting them into action we should never be afraid or I can't do it no if God has commissioned you I mean they're very God that said the disciples went in the disciples hallelujah and he did the work I mean it's exactly the same with us we shouldn't just shrink back and say well I'm just a garden-variety Christian hallelujah if you're a garden-variety Christian Amen you know brother Bram said when the weakest of Christians gets on their knees the kingdom of Hell shakes hallelujah so even if you say you well I'm weak in the faith where you can still shake hell I mean you can still upset the devil's program I'm not strong in faith you don't need to worry about how you feel just take God at His Word that's all you need to do amen no brother Brown says he says we realize who we are wait where are we three two okay realize who we are we'll do the greater work since if we realize that he be he has become flesh in us oh sorry this is actually me so we're going to realize who who we are then we will do the greater works since if we realize that he has become flesh on us he has come in his bright form which is us white we realize that we can impart eternal life healing deliverance comfort peace because it's him in us manifesting through us we're here for a purpose amen hallelujah that brother is now notices is that down Calvary now notice the greater works was to have the power and the church not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it it took stooped degraded men and woman and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of God to heal the sick to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers men who at once unbelievers be made believers and apart spiritual eternal life how much greater is it hallelujah that's what Calvary who came to achieve I mean their God would take a people I was once stooped and degraded that but that was in the past that's not who I am now hallelujah amen we should never let our past derail our future my future sees I'm dancing on the streets of gold that's my destination doesn't matter where I came from it's where I'm going I mean the devil came from being the anointed cherub that covereth he's going to burn in the lake of fire so so he came from the throne but he's going to the lake of fire hallelujah we came from sin and darkness I mean but we're going to the throne hallelujah so we should just rejoice now Jesus says annex one he says but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth now this word power as different to the one that I mentioned about Satan having power remember the one that Satan's had all this power will I give thee was a designated influence it was a privilege it was a jurisdiction but this power that is spoken about next one is the Greek word Dunamis where we get the word dynamite from hallelujah so we have a different kind of we have a different kind of power I mean it's not just a designated Authority I mean but it's a power it's a dynamite power hallelujah I mean this is you shall receive power which is a force I mean specifically a miraculous power I'm in it is a strength that's a violent that's mighty wonderful works it's an abundance and it's an ability I mean so when you receive this power from on high which is the Holy Ghost you're given an ability to overcome all things I mean you give an ability to overcome all complexes I mean you're you've been given ability to overcome all the things from your past and we carry a lot of scars you can even look upon the earth itself this earth is going to be renovated it's going to be a new heavens and new earth it's going to change from what it is to a new but you look you go look at the great mountain yo ranges and things you can see all the strata of the rocks and sometimes the strata is going up like this it's not going flat why was heaven there's been a violent there's been a violent earthquake has thrust up I mean all of the rock who's seen it what's happening this earth has Scouse it has pain if I can put it that way it is scars but those scars are not going to stop it becoming a new heavens and new earth because God has ordained that it will become new again hallelujah now if the earth can be that way remember we have an eternal body waiting hallelujah we are we are gonna when we read in the scripture that he will come and wipe away all tears from our eyes that is literally going to happen we're going to be at the wedding supper table he'll come out in his glory and he'll come one by one wipe off all the tears all the pain it's all over children I mean you can rejoice it's all over hallelujah amen but see the earth the earth has to get rid of all these scars cuz God's ordained you can see all the fossil record great violence has happened upon the earth and has passed many things have been killed in cataclysmic floods and earthquakes and all kinds of terrible things that happen on it so it carries a lot of scars but it's not going to stay with those scars hallelujah we carry scars amen now I didn't expect the hallelujah but you know we all carry scars but those scars are not ordained to hold us back I mean they're not ordained amen to stop us becoming what we call to be hallelujah we should just look at those things you say well I've got scars from my past but rejoice you're no longer that person amen they don't affect you no more I trust they don't I mean because the Lord lifts you I mean from the effect of that scar hallelujah isn't a wonderful thing you know the devil puts pain and wounding in our spirits and he uses it as a doorway he use it as a doorway that that the person that did it to you may never be in your life ever again but someone else comes in and uh you know and somehow because that sky you relate to that person as you did the person that hurt you and the devil anoints that sky and you begin to react the way that you never expected why cause it's a doorway but how glorious it is when the Lord comes and he shuts that door hallelujah he shuts down the devil's ability to use your past against you hallelujah amen but then white Lord came and doesn't bother me no more hallelujah why cause he made mean overcomer he made me an overcomer of that part of rejoice hallelujah when we gather around the throne do you think we're just going to go like this well done good show old chap no we're going to be it's going to be the noisiest place earth is actually the quietest place you'll ever be I mean it's going to be a very noisy place why because we're beyond the washroom Lord you redeem me you saved me you wash me you set me free you took all my son away you took my pain away you took my scars the effect of the skies away hallelujah I was redeemed I was lost I couldn't save my own self you saved me I mean I was broken you mended me I was wounded you healed me hallelujah hallelujah that's that's why we rejoice it's like if you've never been healed before how can you worship God cause he's your healer that's why he allows you to be sick so you can say thank you Lord you healed me hallelujah how can you worship him because he's your Savior and this you've been saved if you've never been saved you can't say Lord you're my Savior because you don't know imma Savior hallelujah but now you can rejoice say Lord you saved me you delivered me from the clutches of the devil I'm not I don't belong to him no more and we never did belong to him anyway hallelujah so you know it's like I was troubled and you brought me peace now you can wash him he's my peace I give unto thee even seasoned John I don't have it on me says no man can will take your joy from you that doesn't mean the devil won't try and take your joy he sure will a member but you've got to stand there and say Satan you have no right that belongs to me that is my joy that is my peace hallelujah you gotta don't shrink back if it belongs to you belongs to you Amen hallelujah so we have power that power is dynamite power hallelujah now he says in Luke 24 and 49 let's just go there we shouldn't let Satan intimidate us we are his worst nightmare you know we're his worst nightmare here's here's people to actually hold the title deed to the earth in their position I mean brother Brahim said when the Holy Ghost comes upon you I mean that is God's abstract title deed now is in your possession and is showing that everything that the devil had against you are struck off I mean nothing is held against you you are God's purchased possession hallelujah so we're his worst nightmare his people that actually everything Adam lost now we have I'm carrying the paperwork in here how did you get it God gave it to me hallelujah Hey his lawyer searched through all of the all of the liens upon the title made sure that wiped off I mean all my son remember if Jesus Jesus doesn't run his business to save you one day lose you the next day amen he doesn't do that I mean if he saved you one day he's gonna keep you hallelujah sure people can backslide or whatever more but if you're one of God's you'll come back I mean he won't he won't leave you he won't leave you in that backslidden state hallelujah he take the I was gonna make making it to a whole service but here we are you take the man go Jesus was asked by a Pharisee or a scribe who's my neighbor Oh deep yeah you know who's my neighbor then Jesus told the parable a certain man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho Jerusalem's up here Jericho's low what's happening here is backsliding Jerusalem's up on the hill Jericho's down in the valley he is backsliding as he was backsliding the enemy got him he was beaten and torn up by robbers what's happening because backsliding always has an effect amen but then the people who should have been able to help remember we've got power we've got passage deliverer we've got power to heal got power to comfort amen so he comes the Levite sees the man can't help him walks on he comes a priest or whatever more but then a Samaritan comes along Samaritans were hated by the Jews you know the Bible says warn to you if all men speak good of you it's actually said why you're in a bad state if everyone likes you what does that mean I've got to make an enemy No if God's in you the devil's your enemy and he'll anoint people to come against you amen so now here comes a Samaritan who's hated by the juice but he's carrying oil and wine he's got what he's got what this man needs he's packing a man we've got power hallelujah here it comes with the oil and the wine and the and then he binds up the man's you know isn't it strange why would you pour oil and wine into words that doesn't sound like good medical sense but Jesus speaking of parable oil is the Holy Ghost and the wine is a stimulation of the revelation so now here's this man who's half dead on the floor and in this Samaritan comes long pause on the oil and wine binds up as wounds I mean what begins to show the word term encourages them it's a right brother amen you're one of them hallelujah it'll be okay isn't the Lord wonderful amen yo and then and then all the pain of the wounds begins to go away because they're now bound up with oil and wine and then the Samaritan puts him on his own beast as I'm power amen takes them into the end which is the church and tears to the pastor look after this one here's two pence or whatever it is and if you need any more I'll pay it when I come back I'll ooh yeah glory say you know we should just rejoice we have we have oil and wine amen we have what we need to help each other Allu yeah you just think you know you can be all down and downcast you begin to think about the Lord a little bit amen should make you happy hey you should be able to just yeah it just changes the whole mood around the place and then someone else comes a brother or sister comes along they can see you down there we're going to talk to you amen fellowship begins to happen and then what happens is you may be down or worried about something your burn is now a lighter brighter is your way everything is not so bad after all why because they have oil and why hallelujah amen so now we were going to look weren't we 24:49 and he says behold I will see in the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in Jerusalem and in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high that that word power again is the Dunamis the dynamite power hallelujah but to be endued it means in the sense of sinking into a garment the definition is to invest with clothing I mean to be a raid to be closed worth just now we put on a jacket we put on he actually says you're gonna be in Jude you're gonna be clothed with this power hallelujah you're gonna be endued with it so now it's part of your being amen it's not just a you know it's not just a temporary anointing but it's always there amen it says in 1st Corinthians 4 and 20 I'm gonna read a few of these for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power but in Dunamis amen as he the first Thessalonians 1 and fire for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and a much assurance as you know what men are of men we were among you for your sake I mean see saying now that the gospel didn't come just in word only but in power came and Dunamis I mean we've got dynamite power hallelujah we just have a designated Authority I mean we got dynamite power hallelujah and in much assurance amen so now I just read this he says this is from the from the church age book let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and any changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature he's just as immutable in his ways the Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God marked 16 in action as the true church that Jesus claims his own all houses false it has to be now remember this the church I'm sorry Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless and exposes Satan revealing his works which is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's work right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for then that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely thought of today as when Christ will stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them I mean so if we get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army now I just want to drop and right here we aren't just endured with power to do miracles I mean but wearing Judith pathan love the word Amen Satan can make no say thing could definitely preach better than me he could quote better than me he could well definitely sing a lot better than me but you know but one thing he cannot do is live the word he does not have the ability to live the entire scripture he cannot do it so the power he has can never enable him amen to live the word to live right I mean but the power we are endued with I mean causes the believer to live the word hallelujah you know that's why I think God changes your nature amen that's all he needs to do USA Lord changed my nature so it's your nature I mean that your desire becomes my desire what you love I love what you hate I hate you know what you what's pleasing to you it will be pleasing to me why because his nature comes into us hallelujah amen so he says this now he sees us in masterpiece I'm just going to read a few of these that I'm going to close he says but the bride came back because she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor he made him a masterpiece for as a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden and it took a piece form and another piece and that was marred and fell speaking of Adam and Eve there's the masterpiece family and that's what God is restoring us to I mean but he's not just restoring us to eat him where we can fall again Amy but he's restoring us past that now we are in a place that we can never fall and I'll say this I'll just echo brother brother Donnie's words you should go listen to the service he said that if you're sealed with the Holy Ghost I mean you're already in a position that you cannot fall from holy security you're already in a better position that Adam and Eve were in hallelujah before the fall hallelujah amen we're still into the day of our Redemption I mean that's what the scripture says so we're in a better place amen yeah we can't fall from then Adam and Eve were and how lujah I'm glad were in that condition aren't you amen so so it was modern it fell but now he's but he's been all this time building it up again and he brought forth this masterpiece and it was smitten so speaking about Lord Jesus Christ that part was smitten it was in order to bring back that masterpiece again so the masterpiece and the son of God the masterpiece and the bride it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the Lord and getting the masterpiece is now we could go back on that but I believe you have the picture what I mean God's building Becker's masterpiece we are part of his masterpiece I mean if we are part of the Lord Jesus Christ we're part of his masterpiece just as Adam or Eve was part of Adam right there and them together upon the earth was God's masterpiece I mean so as Christ and his bride the masterpiece and means that God is building us this is our privilege friends this is our right we are his workmanship that the work he started he will perfect he will complete amen if we stay yielded to him so it must be fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled we're ready for the coming of the Lord he says now see let us not forget that in the beginning when he smoked the side of Adam he took something from a side now the smiting of Christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride he might take him a bride so when his masterpiece was perfected then he had to smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation my brother don't think bad at this but just think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he could never make another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to the be the original word Living God in the word hallelujah he sees in Christ and mystery God revealed he's identified oh how the devil is howling about this the manifested truth of the promised word in her alone that's what we're identified by I mean God's vindicated word living in us that's our identification amen they don't have the answer when Jesus why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the finger of God who do you cast them out by sea he stood alone and the church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of us of the promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by that's why the devil is howling these great organizations has set something up to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she has now risen and by the power of the vindicated word promised to her amen now a bride holds that promise he told me he would return from me I believe it uh-huh yes sir to meet her here to meet her headship her oedema her husband her king her Lord her lover her Savior in the provided meeting place hallelujah I think we can rejoice I'm in queer the musician's place amen amen we ever right if God has made us a certain thing if we yield ourselves completely to him we can't see the difference between us and nature is nature doesn't have a free moral agency I mean it's just run by instinct like the birds and everything they don't have free moral choice but we have free moral choice and God respects that choice he doesn't make us be a Christian amen he just offers it and he says will you or won't you and it's up to you amen so if we want to be part of his great army we have to give our will over to him in order for him to have preeminence and the people our will can can no longer be our own it has to be his will in us amen the greatest victory a person can ever have us come to a place like the Lord and guess Emily not my will but thy will be done I mean where he said he surrendered his own will over to the will of the Father amen they stand shall we I mean brother Jeremy could you come lead us in some songs we're just gonna pray amen let's just close our eyes you're always gonna be a remember to pray just want to raise your hands gracious Father Lord I just asked lord
