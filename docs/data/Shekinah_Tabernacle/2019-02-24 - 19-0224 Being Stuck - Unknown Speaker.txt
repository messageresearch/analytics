been so good to us amen if you got your Bibles handy let's go to 2nd Samuel chapter 16 and just as we're turning so as of this year we only have two volunteers to to clean the church and it's a it's a very vital job you know we come in the place is clean we we don't really think about those kind of things but so if anyone would feel to join in - to volunteer to clean the church you please contact us - Chantal I mean it's a big job it's a very important job let's go to second Samuel 16 and then we're going to go to proverbs 18 and second Samuel 16 first I mean so god bless you brother Andy we city behind you I mean you know Jesus said that this gospel must be preached into all nations in the in shall come we want the in to come we want to go home amen so so let's find that last one it could be in Vietnam somewhere Amen so second Samuel 16 verses 5 to 13 so I don't have a slideshow and when King David came to bury him behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Jimmy I the son of Gera he came forth and cursed still as he came and he cast stones at David and at all the servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left look how bowl dispersed on us and I said show me I win he cursed come out come out their bloody man and thou man of Belial the LORD hath returned upon the all the blood of the house of Saul and who said thou has reigned and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of epsilon by süd and behold thou art taken and I mischief because thou art a bloody man then said Ebor shy the son of Zuria unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over I pray thee in take off his head and the king said what have I to do with thee sons of Zuria so let him curse because the Lord has said unto him curse David who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so now it's not recorded that the Lord actually told him to do it that's how David took it and David said to ever shy and to all the servants behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this Bend you might do it let him alone and let him curse for the LORD hath burden him and it may be that the Lord will look on my affliction and that the Lord will requite me good for this cursing the state and as David and his men went by the way show me I went along on the hillside over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust and the pit and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves there I mean let's go to proverbs 18 and 19 I mean quite a scene there isn't it Allu yeah it's amazing how people act when persecution comes really shows what's in us proverbs 18 and 19 Caesar see just a bit of a context see ya brother a fender that's harder to be won than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle I mean let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer gracious father we thank you we can gather one more time Lord it's such a privilege to be gathered in your presence Lord we thank you in your presence is the fullness of joy Lord everything we have need of us in you and father just asking as we take a little thought here I pray father you would anoint your word to every heart father may just be you speaking today Lord we're not interested to hear the mind my mind Lord what could a human thoughts Lord it takes your thoughts your word to come father and I pray you an anointing chart Lord anoint speaker and hear or one more time father we truly do pray for Vietnam Lord that you would Lord like a rushing mighty wind you'd go forth through that place and gather your elected ones out Lord I pray you be preparing hearts even now and father we just ask that you'll receive all honor glory and praise in this service Lord be at those who are away today father as well we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I'd like to approach the subject about the contentions are as bars of a castle I wanna talk about being stuck now it's amazing where you're we see shimmy I you know he comes out and he any any curses David and and you see cuz shimmy I was was of the tribe of Benjamin he was he was part of Saul's tribe you know he you know he was obviously offended that that God actually removed Saul and he put David in his stead as king and he was offended that that had happened and and and so he was holding on to that offense and then when the time was right he released it upon David and his mighty men it's amazing that it wasn't just David walking there being rejected he was with his mighty men all the people and he comes shimmy a hose one hand cursing him and then spitting on him and throwing stones and you know because that's what contentions are like they are like the bars of a castle where it actually holds a people back from moving we're with goddess and you see that God had moved from soul and God was now establishing the kingdom under David and God had already promised David that his son would would reign under stead and and and you know the house of the Lord would be built so God was moving but shimmy I because of his contentions and his old fence he was stuck in the past now we don't want to come into that category of people I mean so now a contention from the Strong's Concordance as a brawling it's a contest or a quarrel it's a discord or a strife and the and the root word of all there's actually to rule by implication to judge so it's those who are so so if someone who's offended they are they are contentious they are actually fighting a battle that's actually in the past they're holding on to the past but they're living through that moment into the present and so we don't want to be that kind of way I'm thankful that we have the blood of Jesus Christ to actually release us of our past and of our contingents I mean so now we do so we're not called to be stuck in one place no brother Bern he says in a few places but I'll just take a couple of quotes he says now and so in this speaking of Israel coming from you know going from Egypt into the Promised Land so when it came time and the showdown and Israel stood there before the sea God's path lead across the sea so god looked down through the pillar of fire the sea got scared and moved back and Israel went across on dry land got God's parsley through it then he went right up to the wilderness into the springs of a spring of Marah bitter water isn't it strange that God would lead his children through bitter waters but them all goes along the road and when he was there the remedy for the bitter waters were standing on the bank Moses cut down a tree throw it in the water it turns sweet again some through the waters some through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood I'm just continuing on I spoke a couple of Sundays about being detached because of pain I'm just continuing on because I don't I didn't tie it all up so I'm just continuing on you know that vein of thought if you're wondering you know if you think well maybe I'm repeating myself a bit but I'm doing it deliberately because I want to tie this together because you know God's Word is eternal you don't just put a full-stop under a subject and say that's all it just done for I've been so that's the way God leads his children his path God's provided way if the children of Israel would try to bypass go around go down this way they got in trouble they had to follow the cloud of they had to follow the pillar of fire that led them they followed that you know brother Baron he I don't have the quote on me but but he was coming he saw a trial coming up and the Lord actually asked him do you want to bypass this and he said no Lord I'll go through because you'll lead me you know we want to who wants the rugged hard way then I mean I mean I mean in our humanity and our humanity who wants the hungered runway yeah who wants the rugged hard way who wants the stress and the pressure and the you know who wants that no one but we need it I mean we need it hallelujah we need to go through things but we don't want to be eat caught in them in the past right jesus said of John the Baptist when when when he was imprisoned and and and Johnson has disciples to see Jesus and John asked the question are you him or should we look for another and then you know Jesus said to his disciples you know who sit down and see the meeting tell them that the blind see the dead erase the sicker healed the devils cast out he says blessed is he of whosoever is not offended in me so you're blessed if you're not offended by by whatever path you're going down because sometimes we get offended at the situation and we hold on to that we're not called to hold on to it I mean so that's the way so so and if the church and I will only follow the pillar of fire the Holy Spirit you'll make Canaan as sure as anything God has a way a provided way this two ways a man can go that's his way or God's Way and that's the right way or the wrong way your way is always the wrong way oh yeah hey when I read that I was like you say so true and God's Way is the right way God is always right Amy I'm sure we could just establish that God is always right as word as always right it's always correct and every circumstance every generation God's Word is right man way is always wrong that's why this world is heading to a tribulation cuz man's way is wrong because they rejected the Son of Man in this generation Jesus Christ and we're going into a chaos Alleluia but we're not but we're not call to stay here amen so you can't have your own way in God's Way at the same time so you've got to get out of your own way so God can have his way in you that's right God has a provided way a made he said that though there's from God's Way has been made for us in 52 now 1962 from that time but you see when you make an organization 19 percent of us when we make one we put down this is what we believe period if you would say this is what we believe comma plus as much as God will add to us that's all right then that's perfectly fine and that's exactly when the pillar of fire moved Israel moved with it and in the New Testament when it begin to move just exactly like it did in the Old Testament it moved the same way Israel had to follow that pillar of fire and set the tent up under it and when it began to move in this last the Reformation Martin Luther saw it and then as soon as Luther was over they built an organization around Luther's work God moves right out from under it Wesley saw it in a way he went after Wesley and Asbury many of the others and after that time then what happened they built an organization under it God moves right out from under us he went right on C and now we Pentecostals are doing the same thing you can't organize the holy spirit you can't do it we believe in organizations to keep Brotherhood and so forth it serves a good purpose but it always stretched the blanket out to to get the other brother see and hold your heart open to get what God is ready to send down upon us that's the way to do it that's the real Brotherhood and so I like that amen then he says and then he says and as your life worthy of the gospel 1963 remember Israel walk day and night by the pillar of fire when that pillar of fire moved they moved with it and remember it was the fire at night the cloud of day so it might come day or night any time but wherever it was there was a propitiation made that they would not fail to see it it was a light at night a cloud in the daytime and they followed it yes sir the same thing Martin Luther sort what did he do he came out of Catholicism what did they do they built a little fence around here where Lutheran's that's it when Wesley saw it moving right there he went what they do build a little fence around and said this is it where'd the light go move right on again Peter coughs aw where'd they go moves right out of the Wesleyan and Nazarene and so forth what did they do they built a little fence around it they call whether oneness with a Trinity whether United all this what did he do God moves right out of it see you cannot do that you've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way you've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ if you if we don't we take an organizational life and the life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy now what as an organizational life because it's easy to throw that on the denominational system but the message is not you know this is not a pitch walking message this message justice has been sent to mold us and shape us into the image of the word how Lewis does not all that's for that person what about me amen and so what is an organizational life an organizational life is a life your arranged for yourself instead of letting God lead you you can organize your life yourself you can organize your Christian life yourself and you actually become an organization you following me hey this comes down home amen so we don't want to organize you say but I am following the revealed word of this day if it's not a heartfelt real revealed love for God then it becomes an organization we're not called to have a working relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ amen so how is it done you know to be organized well you say you've got all the doctrine sorted out how you should dress and and what you believe I believe it cannot do and can do that's all organize see if it's just if it's just well you have your document of faith this is how you should live and it's just a arrangement it's just like a job you're following me I'm gonna go babe a bit slow but we're going okay we're going so and just like a job this is your job description I mean this is your job description this is your conditions of work this is how you should dress it your worksite whatever more and you take that same thing and you bring it into the into the message it's the same thing if it's not a heartfelt relationship all it is then there's an organizational life Amen you say well you've painted a lot of people with a lot of brushes no that's that's how it is if it's not from here if it's if it's from here it's not gonna that's why people if it's only in their mind then what happens is they hit a bump in the road they come to a midlife crisis or some Junction in their life they always fall off the track because they're not tied to the absolute of God revealing himself in his word to them amen so we don't want to be that kind of way we want to be led by the pillar of fire personally I mean Moses knew the pillar of fire and that's why he was victorious and bringing Israel out of Egypt taking them up to your to Sinai all the way up to the border and then Joshua met that same God hallelujah Koren Nathan did not know them and that's why they rose up that's why they're people who who join themselves with with with Moab different ones they didn't know the pillar fire personally they had a working relationship we're not called to have a working relationship the Bible is a love letter not a rule book right but it will be a rule book to all those who are not the Bride of Christ amen you take you contrast the rich young ruler with the woman at the well the rich young ruler comes up good master what can I do what can I do that I may inherit eternal life there's no pricking in the heart like like x2 he's wanting what can I do well it's happening he's trying to change his job description right he wants to change his pay his wages he wants eternal life as the wages how can I change and then so and then so he says what can I do and then so Jesus approaches them as the return rule or approaches them you know the law do this do this do this he says I've been doing this in this in this one thing now lakor's you've got a by Potter takeaway yogurt they shall I sell all that you have give our your identity give it up what you think you are take up your cross and follow me and he couldn't do it because it didn't fit his preconceived idea but yet he was a good church member outstanding member of society he was a good message believer but he did he just had a working relationship the woman at the well very different she didn't begin to speak to him when when Jesus says bring me a drink and they began to talk about Wells and then he said woman if you knew the water I could give I mean that that your drink of this and never thirst again she didn't say no what do I need to do said give me a drink give me in this water hallelujah and then she said now we know where Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things and brother Bram said that the light quickened the seed and her salt holy and she God redeemed amen why is that because it was a because she was part of the bride it wasn't a rule book it was a love affair hallelujah and that's why the Bible I trust to you is a love letter Lori it's not a rule book it's a love letter but those who just have a working relationship it's a rule book amen and that's why the critics raised up they say are you just bunch of rules no no no to you it might be to me it's not close to me it's a love letter hallelujah when I came into this message where I met the Lord Jesus Christ I had no church to go to people didn't tell me where I needed to stop and do whatever more I just listened to the tapes I read my Bible and I said Lord cleanse me of everything this country to your word that you can come and dwell in me and he transformed my life hallelujah I don't need to say I need to give up this and what shall I do Lord change me Lord transform me hallelujah and that's what he did hallelujah and I follow living witness at works Amen that's why we don't want some organizational life we want the life of God lujah and that's what we have Laurine amen now it's very vital it's very very vital that we don't take and I think I don't know who said it but this has been on my heart for a couple of weeks but we don't want to let the word I think it was on Wednesday someone said it but anyway never let the word become common never ever Scofield and his notes now brother bear I'm said summer Scofield's notes a right and some are not right any preacher from a lot of them cuz barter melikhaya Falls ministry was to type the Lucien's right they all had partial truth down through the ages they weren't totally wrong right but then he said part of that ministry was to type the leucine so he did and he said so summer Scofield's notes are right some are not right but he would took when when Scofield was laying out the mysteries of the kingdom from and the Gospel of Matthew and he lays out what the mysteries of the kingdom of the brother room adds to it when he preaches services it's the time of the end but Scofield says about the mysteries of the kingdom a mystery in the scripture as a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but in which a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation so what I'm so the reason but me I see that is that sure oh I know what the doctrine is but there's a supernatural element contained in that truth and that is the important thing amen that when God opens his truth there's a supernatural power is released but there's a supernatural element right and so now there is a supernatural power released as revelation breaks forth upon you amen and it may be well you've heard many many things to be very elementary but never let it become common because the reason that it may be ministered on is because there's a supernatural element which can contain within it needs to be released to us amen so so that's why it's so important when we come to worship the Lord we come to church who are we worshiping are we are we here based on who's around us amen yo contingents are like a bars of a castle and can be a massive thing or it can be a little thing they can still be bars right buzz buzz stop people coming in and out of a castle and offenses you think about offenses really only hurt the person who's offended amen as that's why it says Paul says in the book of Hebrews do not lead a root of bitterness grow within you whereby many are defiled so it may never be the person who caused the offense but it's those who get hurt and offended they're the ones that are actually still stuck right so it actually does you or does us more harm than good to hold on to things it doesn't do the other person they could be on they could have forgotten they could have moved on completely but now we're still carrying something and a slight bars of a castle we just stuck I want to walk on don't you hallelujah so now so when we come to church we're here to worship the Lord Jesus Christ so and and I'll come into this later but you know the main thing about walk our life should be what has impact upon us his influence right our whole life should be out of because he met us right our whole life so when we come to church now and we worship our worship should not be in a condition of who's around us right so we shouldn't be louder or quieter because of someone else that has nothing to do with it when I come and worship I don't worship because you're here I worship Him because he's here and because he saved me I can't speak for you but he saved me transform me he redeem me heal me he set me free amen he broke the power of sin and death off me that's why I worship Him because of what he has done to me hallelujah because he's opened his word to me amen so so our worship should never be based upon well there that person's here or this person's here so I better not maybe shout or scream because this person or I better be loud because this person's here why it's not you them and God it's you and God Shannon with God in the secret place hallelujah but now the problem is the devil comes along because there's power your the scripture says we believe and therefore speak right so if you believe you've got a you got to respond I'm into the wood you've got to respond to it you can't just sit back and shell up I mean you really want God to have a great effect in your life you've got to audibly say from your heart yeah god bless all the hard work amen so you know take the clip off too but you know we well you know the devil doesn't want us to respond turn me down a bit you know I went so there's a testimony and I've already shared it but when we had the Kemp went down to brother Greg's family camp in Christchurch last evening service I went up for prayer I said I want a revival for myself and and revolver for the church and a few other things and then after you pray for me he said go receive it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and my response was I receive it that's what I said back because I wasn't saying it to brother Craig I sang it to the Lord and the Spirit of God came down upon me Holly and I had a Jubilee I mean but the reason is because I responded saying yes I receive it that's why it's so important to say Amen I mean to respond you've got to actually break break that sound barrier the devil doesn't want us to shout and rejoice and be free I mean because we you know if someone's real teens okay if someone's really tense and you go to speaking to them about something very important how do you think that's going to go might be a very difficult conversation right but if the person's relaxed and they're happy and everything's fine you can go speak to them about the same thing and it can go way better and it will impact them a lot more why cuz they're free they're relaxed they're happy hallelujah it's the same thing when we come into church hallelujah I like to wonder I mean it's funny when you you know you see some people's face you can see some looks like it when I go like this like a little colorless some people go why what's gonna happen I don't know myself sometimes you start doing some things and you're a man you like I can't believe I just did that oh yeah hey we're gonna be free I mean that's why you know what we're coming to church don't worry don't worry about anyone else who cares about them oh you being selfish absolutely I want to meet my god I wouldn't wish my love for him I want to give them praise I want to say thank you Lord our Lord enjoys worship our Lord enjoys it when we come down we begin to praise Him he's a yeah his angels gather they begin to watch they can't sing and rejoice I can't join in they probably say they say I wonder what it's like they can't imagine it they don't know what it's like to be redeemed hallelujah they just servants they know they're a team once and then you know and then you know then the Lord comes down we begin to rejoice and he says I know Oh hallelujah I redeemed you I I took on your iniquity your sins are upon me I carried them up Calvary that day I was sick I know what it's like to be sick I know what it's like to me afflicted I know if I can be tempted on old voice I understand what you've been going through I know what it's like to overcome sorry joy say you're ever me hallelujah you know what it's like he goes through a great thing you come out the other side and you see someone come out the other side as well yyyyyes good you can do it oh yeah I know it can be done why should you cheering them on we want to cheer each other on hallelujah I been said now we don't want to but see the devil he wants us to be quiet there's no glue on these seats okay I just say that now oh really would be big Luke the devil puts glue the devil tries to put some tape over here be silent sit still no devil you sit still you shut up and sit down I'm going to worship God hallelujah because the thing is now when we really pull we really say Amen we're not a meaning the minister we're not a meeting the minister you you're a meaning you're agreeing with the word and when you agree with the word a metre releases power to you it releases the Holy Ghost to you I mean when you agree with the word so it's very important to say Amen it's very important to be locked in don't be distracted by anything don't be don't be sidetracked by all of this and this and this that's you know what that is it's called the fiery darts of the devil he has a bow any fires arrows but we have a shield of faith hallelujah I sealed her face and and we're hot and were called to hold it up withstand the fiery darts of the enemy and you know the greatest way to actually withstand the fiery darts what does he fire at you oh brother songs or the song soda and you know you know the best way to actually hold up that shield of faith how do you how do you deflect those always give them the benefit of the doubt it's really that simple are they wouldn't really say to em oh they would really they didn't really mean that hallelujah it goes a long way I mean but then if it turns the other way and you agree take that done pull into yourself we're gonna be a casualty on the battlefield the only casualty on this battlefield is Satan oh yeah only one Amen so the more and then also the more you Amy in him the Lord you will cause the minister to say things he never even thought he is saved he had come to your address the Lord will not the man right brother Ram said we are not feeding off the mind of them of a man but we're feeding of the body word of the son of man this is you're not feeding off my thoughts he's saying you're feeding off the body word the Lord Jesus Christ himself hallelujah amen so the more our faith pulls on the gift even even if someone singing a special you in Turin you say mean what happens then you're actually receiving because when people are singing it's this is not an entertainment david got us harp he played in Saul's palace and it brought God down the devil got cast out why do people sing specials amen that God would come down and the devil gets cast out hallelujah that's why you know Saul he had that spirit is all you know that evil spirit is all tormented in his mind what happens a spirit and you may not be possessed but you could be a priest all torn up in here amen and then and then someone who's anointed begins to sing a special and then afterward you like oh I enjoyed that that was nice what's happening that tormenting is gone away hallelujah now you're a peace or wasn't that a nice song I enjoyed it what's happened now you can relax the devil's been kicked out oh yeah I mean you know I'm just trying to say you know this is what happens sometimes we think of some you know but this is how it just really works how lujah amen okay so never let the would become common amen and we don't and figures you say well I can't say I mean I'm not in the right place well I'll say this we agree with the word not based upon what the devil is telling you you are right or what you think you are Amen we don't agree with the word because well I'm this person no I agree with it because it's what G sis I am a mink Caleb and Joshua they I know I've said it many times but they had the same whip marks and slave beatings that the rest of us are all had that were slaves in Egypt but something in them said we have a land and we're gonna go occupy that land we are not slaves no more amen so they weren't agreeing with the word that came through Moses because of what they felt they were they agreed with it because God said go take your land it belongs to you hallelujah it's the same thing with us I'm it's not well I'm this I'm this frail person whatever whatever would no no look at what God says you are and agree with that Amen hallelujah Amen now see then that's why mine battles come on it's cuz the devil is trying to rob us of our victory and distract us of what we have and for us to focus on his nonsense and not the Lord I mean this got a first job three I see time is running away let's catch up time through John first John I believe first John three and one behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is we have living at the time of the appearing at the coming of the Lord amen brother Brahim see that there's the difference between the appearing in the coming right the coming you could say is the meeting in the year but he's already come in spirit form but he's appearing among us so when we shall see him we shall be like him we're seeing him now his word is manifesting I mean so when we see him and we and we do see him we shall be like him so he see him working among us this is round the world not just in these four walls I'm glad it's that case hallelujah the bride around the world is coming because they are she is see him and she is becoming like him I mean we're becoming more like his word because we see his word manifested hallelujah we shall see him for for we shall see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure now the word hope we know in the Bible that means to anticipate usually with pleasure and expectation or a confidence so every man that has this expectation to to to be like him see him as he is right so everyone who has this expectation this confidence or anticipating this will you with pleasure purifies himself even as he is pure now when I'm talking about this now I'm talking about getting rid of offenses getting rid of you know we don't want those things we want to be pure of those things we want to be cleansed amen now whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for the sin i so for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither knoweth him now we know that him that sinneth me to continue to practice but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us amen never ever let the devil get you down with your failures amen let the Lord lift you up he focus on his work I meant now we know we're living at a time when in does the fullness of adoption comes we're waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our bodies now I want to I want to read this from from this from show us the father and it will satisfy us he says God lives forever God's eternal God can't die they killed the body Jesus but God raised it up again he's alive forevermore his spirit lives in the church today his spirit is here now has spirits among his people he proves herself not by something he could prove himself alive by this he could prove himself alive by the sunset he could prove herself alive by his word he could prove herself alive by a spirit that's in the building now by men and women who will commit themselves to him amen you can make yourself to him and say what happens brother branham when you see those visions it's nothing in the world but just having a gift to know how to relax myself get William Branham off to one side that's the biggest enemy I got as William Branham he's always in my way that's why we've got to relax push ourselves off to one side that's what a gift is getting yourself out of the way allowing God to use you I mean he's always in my way he's always in God's way I will say he always gets in God's way he gets too tired he don't want to do this he don't want to do that if I can just crucify that guy God can use it God can use this body use this microphone it's a mute till I speak in it or someone else speaks in it but it can't speak itself how can a man see a vision how could a man heal a sick person how could laying on of hands bring a dead baby to life and so forth how could it ever do it it's not the man it's God in that man just the same God as in the sunset God's everywhere hallelujah so you know I'm sure all of us have that expectation of that hope that when we when he appears we shall be like him fool see him as he is and we're living in that hour right so if we're living in that hour he's appearing among us then everything else you go off to one side right because ultimately what really matters in life you know we talk about issues and problems and they can be very real I'm not diminishing anything that's happened but at the end of the day you put them on one side and you put what God's election that I'm going to be that I'm the Bride of Christ he's appearing among me he's revealing himself to me I'm becoming more like like him every day he's fighting my battles he's leading me he's redeem me he's washed me he's transformed me well you take that on one side and you take that what the devil is trying to do to you what really should outweigh a man I think just tip that scale up because it doesn't matter and just let the Lord have his way I mean but as I believe I said in the beginning it's the thing that M access the most will be what we live through in life right so you just take it in the natural you know we someone who had a big massive trauma in their life like a car accident yeah I'm talk about physically now that will impact them the rest of their life how they can operate in their body right they could be crippled they could be in a wheelchair whatever more but then if but they never say the Lord came along or say in the natural realm Edison came along and totally restored their bodies that they had normal function again what's gonna have the biggest influence it won't be the car accident amore it'll be the healing right it'll be the healing that will impact the person not the character anymore and it's the same thing with the Lord you know what what what governs our lives I'm just trying to look for the right words but what governs our lives has the greatest influence in our lives I think it is easy to say well I'm a Christian but what is actually living through you what's the greatest influence you know Amen now brother brown spoke about the Apostle Paul he spoke about a few when he when he preached the sermon the absolute or the absolute his homework class go listen to the two to absolute amen now now how could so how we could go through the scriptures daniel has absolute Shadrach Meshach Abednego there absolute David has absolute they all absolute that absolute as the final say the final authority you know we all have to have an absolute and we all do have an absolute every person on this earth actually has an absolute whether they realize it or not everyone has an absolute now Paul had one too the one we are reading about he had a christ-centered life I mean so he had a christ-centered call and that was his absolute that's the reason he wasn't afraid of what Agrippa would say standing there Agrippa was a Jew as we know and so then when he is standing before these kings and things God had already told them he would stand there so he had an absolute so he told exactly the heavenly vision said I am NOT I wasn't just dishonorable - it did not misjudge it I didn't misbehave myself but he held to and was not disobedient it carried out to the minute for it wasn't absolute and any and any christ-centered life that's your absolute I mean when the when the god of the message when the God of the Bible meets you hallelujah that becomes your absolute I mean because you know now the word is an absolute I mean there's no there's no doubt in the scripture anymore you know it's God's Word hallelujah because you've met the author of the word amen and that's like the Apostle Paul you know many things he wrote he didn't he didn't a reference to the Old Testament he just said it I meant but because he meant the author of the Old Testament he could say you know there was no reference he had for the Lord himself shall to see him with a shout with the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God that did in Christ to be raised he didn't reference it with anything only he brought it out I'll show you a mystery not it you know he didn't say that write it down because everyone else was saying it no because God revealed it to him I mean but because he knew the God of the Old Testament he could say that and the only way you can actually believe in a 3-fold this tension of God in the river yo and the rapture the shout the voice in the trumpet was because you believed the Apostle Paul's writings amen and if he knew that God same God the Apostle Paul knew then you say Amen and then you could say to someone near what you know what we just heard at this meeting the Lord's gonna see him with a shout the voice and the Trump of God that didn't cross the race and someone asked you who told you that well the Apostle Paul did Paul of Tarsus yeah he did and some people say no I can't believe that but if you had a christ-centered life you'd know the same God that spoke through Moses spoke through Paul hallelujah same thing with brother Branham I mean just these things it's all in the scripture but people don't look they just take a snapshot of what the devil says and they take that swallow down and walk on and stead of waiting upon the Lord say Lord is a word prophet it'll be in here amen no so any Christ centered life that's your absolute the word becomes your apps amen now since meeting him face to face on the road to Damascus that was that meant so much to Paul now remember he was a scholar beforehand he was a mighty man in the scriptures but he didn't have any type post but the Sanhedrin would back him up in a diploma and a great teacher that that was his absolute that's what Vietnam needs it's not a it's not a church backing up but meeting God and themselves then he will become their absolute but that's all of us - amen that means he won't be tossed around by culture or criticism or questions or whatever more if we're anchored on the Word of God I mean then we will endure he was Amen the only thing he had his absolute was only as strong as his organization was that's all the stronger he could be and he was working faithful to that and he was taking Christians and binding them and making havoc of them and he even stone Stevens why cuz that was his absolute and now but he hadn't there was an organizational life we don't want to have an organizational life in the message we're not called to it that's not the reason we're believers we're believers because we met the Lord Jesus Christ who is his word amen now brother Brown speaks about a house being built I'm so I'm just throwing these things out there I trust we the Lord will put it all together I believe it isn't us same direction but he's speaking about a house being built and and and a brother here yo this is nothing early in his ministry he is having a debate with someone about the baptism and then that man had a dream that night about building a house and in the and in the so he has given the plans and he and he built this house but he rearranged it cuz he thought no it's not quite right but then the one who gave him the job to build the house looked at the plans looked at the houses said no this is not right tear it down and build it again like I said and when he woke up he realized the Lord is telling him no you have to be built according to the blueprint so he got rebaptised name our Lord Jesus Christ cuz that's the Bluenose Isle Lou you the blueprint if the house goes out country - the blueprint the contractor will tear it down and rebuild it but it's got to go to the blueprint no matter what your experience is then if something and you tells you that the Bible isn't true that power of God the apostles prophets teachers and pastors and the gifts of the Spirit just isn't the same as it was when it flow through the Apostles at Pentecost there are something wrong with your absolute it has to it has to tie to a denominational Creed a seat of gods Bible then he said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail watch what your absolute is you might be absolutely sure that you're in a good fellowship with the pasta and might be absolutely sure that you're in fellowship with a district priests peretta and might be absolutely sure that you're in fellowship with the bishop or some other great man in your church but that then your absolute isn't Jesus Christ upon this rock I'll put my absolute and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it spiritual revelation of who he is and knowing all right now when you become like Paul having the same absolute that he had a christ-centered life as a different life than what you once had and it might have been a very religious life that you lived amen if you can read in that Scripture something that Christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because of some twisting around if someone could tell you that that was for the disciples or someone else and then you don't hold on to that then Christ is not your absolute that person who led you out of the way as you absolute but if that word Christ still holds seed and he's your absolute you mustn't let anything stir us out of the way the word see so whatever leads us out of the way becomes our absolute because it has the greatest influence upon our lives now I won't just say that's people but I can say that as events in our life can lead us out of the way I'm bringing it down that angle now right so whatever leads us becomes our absolute the person that leads us the person or the thing that leads us becomes our absolute now so you know as I said before the greatest the thing that impacts us the most or influences in our life is what will manifest amen you take you take someone who becomes a like a Buddhist if Buddhism becomes the greatest influence in that person's life they will manifest it amen many people they will you know become a Buddhist they'll go join a monastery change their whole life why because it becomes their absolute amen you read many accounts I'm sure of of young people when when Isis was coming into its strength in a Caliphate or whatever as was being proclaimed and many people from overseas went to join Isis young people and it's because they begin to sing their videos online and reading their teaching then they begin to manifest it amen and many fled overseas to Syria to join up why because the spirit behind it anointed them and it became their absolute everything they did them was a result of it as I say Beck can be the same thing with her well I haven't done that kind of thing but then they can be a bruisin in the spirit something could happen and wound us in our spirit then then there Bruce brother is like a cancer cells get bruised then a demon power enters into that cell and then begins to multiply itself what happens life comes into it because if something happens and then our life goes very differently he takes sickness some people allow it to rule them and they put a far greater restriction upon themselves because of the sickness as opposed to those who have exactly the same thing wrong with them and don't allow it to rule them yeah you understand what I mean some people get sick and they go extreme right some people get sick they take the medication of course their lives have to changed a little bit because they're sick but they don't let it rule them you understand what I'm saying right so what has the greatest impact now and it's the same thing you say well those can be little things or it can be extreme yeah but what about those things will we allow past hurts and pain to they become our contentions and they allow and we allow them to be like bars of a castle okay men I'm doing massive things or little things we should be free I mean we should be free to worship if we feel to be quiet we can be quiet of a filter be loud we can be loud I mean I'm not saying gods on a cookie cutter I'm expecting Yvonne to dance on chairs but if you if you feel lead to and God's anointing you to do it shouldn't you be feel feel free to do it if you feel free just to sit in your seat and pray quietly shouldn't you be feel free to do it amen now so we have to the Apostle Paul it's amazing really you know he lists everything he went through shipwrecks beatings you know hunger failure whatever he was he went through a lot of things he said none of these things move me because those things the Lord meeting him on the road to Damascus was a far greater expect upon him and all of those things none of those things moved them amen and that should be the same with us if we've really met the Lord nothing should move us hallelujah nothing should really sure yo you know we get burdens for one another you see things get burdens be you both always just pray for that person pray for that thing but don't let it wear you down because we should be able to have a burden at the same time rejoice hallelujah I mean don't need anything rob you of the joy of your salvation you know the art no so so the armchair sportsman as the biggest critic any athlete has the armchair sportsman he is the biggest critic an athlete has okay and some of them analyze the game and far more greater detail than it ever would and they look at the replays and say what'd he do this here and they had gone to great discussion who's had friends like that who's been thanked that may be but that's it but the problem is their persons not on the field you know what if what if there's a big stadium right and you're playing I just take the soccer world cup or some Olympics 100 you know and you're about to run I don't know who the fastest doesn't matter that guy you're about to run and there's a bunch of critics in the stands like this but yet they're on the colors of the you know the same nation they mean to be on his site and they're criticizing him what if he just said okay hold on you come down and run then you can take my place and they're out like this you know do you think they'll get off there do you think they'll come around 100 in this place they can't do it they're not cool to do it you know but now criticize long until the night they'll say I'll bet about this and listen II put you although most know most my new things but they can't do what the athlete does now listen friends we're all on the field amen we are not in the grandstands we're all on the field and then we're all we're all in the game hallelujah so who cares about what the armchair critics saying who cares about them don't worry about what the devil tries to put a cold breeze through the church all and tries to divide and whatever more who cares about that hallelujah listen I played soccer inhale I played it on sunshine I played it in rain well the first games I played when I was five every other team game was cancelled on the field it was just us and the other team we were playing five hailing down holy you just got to run a bit more don't need the cold Bobby hey you you want to play you want to play the game we're gonna win what about the hail in your eyeballs who cares we're having fun hallelujah it's the same thing with the I know it's a very crude illustration but aren't we are we running are we running this race this race is set before us I mean are we in a race he said well the devil's doing all kinds of things run he's just distracting you although sore focus no okay I've never really seen it but you watch a I've never seen a sportsman who's focused you see a real top athlete they're not running maybe children are like this because they're running on and seeing if mum and dad are watching them yeah when they're little but you know they get to a certain age they just get in the zone hallelujah and and I've never been in like a big European football stand but apparently the noise is so all like South America they don't sit there like us you know that was nice let's go home no they're all singing imagine that a hundred thousand or 80,000 people see seeing the same song what an atmosphere that the devil creates and his cathedrals hallelujah but do you think that those sports were really focused on what their fans are doing no they're focused on on on their role on the field and they're zoned out hallelujah we should be zoned out to what the Devils doing so we're not ignorant to his devices but no way we're gonna score a goal how are we going to run this over the final finish line maybe we're gonna the dead in Christ they're gonna rain we're gonna win over a finish line with the beddin holy and this one we're gonna do don't worry about the crowd don't worry about what this thing or chanting you know we had you know boarding school yeah boarding school we're all in different houses we had chants we have ones against other houses you know boo knew your dozen different songs and which aren't PC anymore so but you know anyway don't want to offending you anymore and so anyway you know but but but we were booing them and say singing songs against them and listen listen listen us you know that's what the devil does you know we should what we should really do is just rise to the occasion God rises to the occasion he rises to the occasion every time he's not afraid of a scrap yes brother Isaac preach fight hallelujah we shouldn't be we shouldn't shrink back either you know to me how Lou you don't be you're the devil tries to push you down no you just push back you're gonna say burger first Satan Here I am I'm showing you whose side I'm on I'm not on your side hallelujah I'm here to worship the Lord Amen so don't worry about what someone else might say just walk with God hallelujah and if you're carrying the ball we're here to support you hallelujah amen now brother BAM says and then Jesus came in 1957 I'm just gonna read the whole quote he says the world is ready for judgment we're going to receive it now you mark my word it won't be too long until there's going to be something take place when I seen this revival that swept in a moment that's when over standing there then that Morningstar hanging yonder on the river twenty-something years ago he said the message will sweep the world and there's been an old-fashioned Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Ghost and revival fires the healing services have covered the globe they have made many mistakes the newspapers right up here not longer off of Mackrell or McCall's when that man set my meeting up here and Minneapolis some of them mr. Peterson and em came telling me that he was in the meeting I said no doubt at all but I never searched but you never searched your article right you said aaand wrote that book and Al and had nothing to do with it then if that was such a mistake I believe the rest of its a lot of mistakes I see truly the Brethren might deserve a lot of criticism they made many mistakes that's all right but brother I drop those RL Israel want to get to my brother I'd rather be found on the battlefield making mistakes then be a criticized of the man who's trying to get soul saved to God what are you doing about it blessed be the name of the Lord God the power of the Lord Jesus Christ is just as sufficient tonight I'll say this morning it's the only raucous the only hope it's the only faith and Christ has presented it to you we will make mistakes but I'd rather be on the battlefield trying to get soul saved he says what are you doing about it hallelujah now let's go to Ephesians chapter 3 you know I'll learn - yeah but you know oh you know God's what you're one of God's greatest complaints against brother Bernie said I'm always trying to have to push you into something that's what he said to him just go I'll lead you you know you're sure we want to be lead have confidence and Lord's with us but we have standing orders go yet go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe so it's not to just the apostles but to them of a belief hello believers and my name you shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpents though in your drinking anything will show no harm you amen let's have Commission that's our standing orders if God wants to deviate from it he'll tell you amen so let's go Ephesians 3 chapter 16 and then I'll just I'll just wrap up with wrap up with us and then something else now Ephesians 3:16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory be strengthened with might by his spirit and the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height amen and to know the love of God which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God now under him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think according to the measure that I'm according to the power that worketh in US and to him be the be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end amen now we keep reading because you don't just stop there I therefore now the word therefore means for that reason so for the reason we just read that you would know the height breadth depth you're the fullness of Christ the love of God you know you you'd be filled with all the fullness of God this is a that this would happen I therefore so for that reason that that would happen to you either prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation when you are called with all lowness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity the Spirit in the bond of peace there is one body one spirit so I am one spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the gift measure of the gift of Christ see saying because of this this is how we should be we all want to be filled with the fullness of God we don't just want a part of the land the son of man we want to be in the fullness of it well Ouya so because of that and that we would know the love of God because of that for that reason I beseech you this is how you should walk not to be offended I mean not to hold on to grudges but to let it go hallelujah to be with all lowness and meekness and with long-suffering your long-suffering means you suffer long Amen I'm just trying to you know what a change the atmosphere a bit but to but to have long-suffering means you suffer long and Peter plea said well how long should I be with someone would Peter asked Jesus how many times should I forgive someone seven times a day no seventy times seven there's 490 times a day you should forgive someone I don't know how many things to forgive a minute but that's a lot or how many how many offenses are now that you need to forgive and that's not just giving lip service there's actually generally forgiving and when you forgive someone you surrender the right to hold it against them that's how you know you've actually forgiven someone as you don't hold it against them anymore it's been given over amen and then we drop down we're still in Ephesians 4 let's drop down to verse 27 neither give place to the devil so don't give him room I mean don't give him real estate in your mind or in your life don't give him room because the only way he can come in as a few retreat I mean so when an offense comes and you take on that offense what's happening you're retreating I mean you've given place to the devil now he can come in and Tom it now he's got a door he can come through we're not called to have a door to the to the devil hallelujah let him that still let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with us hands the thing which is good that he may give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the hearers why's he stay sir why does he say rather let him that stole steal no more but let him labor he's saying do the opposite because if you're a robber you're a thief then that that lodges in your conscious what's happening you've given place to the devil to work so now he's saying you really want to overcome that do the opposite that's what brother Graham says if you got a complex do the opposite of the complex it will shall be broken hallelujah amen and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you this is this is how we should be I don't want to be living in a castle I've got a whole land a castles a limited space a lot of powerful fortresses are quite small I don't want it to be walking and you know what a fortress really becomes a prison amen you may be the king of that prison but you're still in a prison or the Queen I don't want to live in a little prison I want to walk up and down the land let's go into the field of joy hallelujah let's got the mouth and of peace let's go by the rumors of cold water follow these guys are the glades of fellowship whatever you want to call let's walk hallelujah let's enjoy the whole word amen now let's go to Jobe we just got to finish with Jobe you say well let's go the last chapter of Jobe now the key the key of all these things we'll read here you say well I've been wounded we've all been wounded amen and Jesus where did he get his wounds in the house of his friends that's what he's gonna tell the Jews when he comes back to them so it's closest to us hurt us the most amen Joe Bloggs on the street well he's Joe Bloggs on the street but someone you've been Worth and you love them and you know them then they hurt you that's the pain now job job jobs friends came to him and for the whole book of Job when they're talking they're actually lying to him about who God is I mean trying to confess that he's something that he's not you're a secret center this is why this happened here they were giving him they were actually lying to him but now notice it's got a job 42 and 7 and we're going to read down to verse 10 and it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Jobe the Lord said to to LFS the temanite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath therefore take unto you now seven bullets and seven Rams and go to my servant job and offer up yourselves our burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will I accept least I deal with you after your folly and that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job what they were actually telling lies they they thought they were telling the truth but they're actually telling lies they weren't saying what was true about the Lord so L Affairs the temanite and bildad the shuhite and and therefore the nemah night went and did according as the LORD commanded them and the Lord also accepted Jobe and the Lord now notice this is this is the final part I know brother Billy Williams preached on this but and the Lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the Lord gave job twice as much as he had before so job's trial finished when he prayed for his friends when he actually forgave him and interceded on their behalf because God's wrath was kindled against them amen and we're to be like Jobe amen and that's how job's captivity with it we see because no cuz I'm sure the question as well I've got this in my life I don't want bars of a car I don't want a contention of some of the passing how do I get rid of it you have to be able to intercede his brother fruity Easter seed about you know rid their quark to stand shoulder to shoulder with that person and lift them into the presence of God not to stand shoulder to shoulder with have been condemned him as a God you deal with this person no stand shoulder show them that when you come into the prints of God you will intercede on their behalf amen and that's how job's captivity was turned it wasn't his friends captivity it was jobs captivity and Joe had a big trial in his life and he wasn't asking for it he didn't deserve it and we don't deserve things that happened to us right really we don't but it happens because God wants to prove his salvation amen and many times we don't even know the reason why it happens but yet we've got to come to a place where our Lord I whoever did this to me you have to pray in such a way now if you actually have a real of relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ you'll be able to do it amen that you can actually say Lord forgive them what did Jesus do Jesus wasn't hanging on the cross saying no I don't mean this is a joke but he didn't say now are you gonna ask me to forgive you yet they were killing him he didn't care about how they treated him he just said Father forgive them they don't know what they do amen so his cry as he interceded for those who are killing him he was into sitting for those who rejected him he interceded for those who hated him and it was in the house of his friends he received the wounding he said Father forgive them they don't know what they do it's not friends if that's how we meet to be if our Lord can do that and we're made in His image we can't do that do listen he isn't amazing how the Lord just brings us down to a showdown what are you gonna do are you gonna hold on are you gonna let go I'd let go I'd say Lord so many times not why you know we come into a place well quite often if you look at yourself and you get disappointed with yourself something happens it's like a button just gets pushed and you explode you know something happens and you think it's like Lord why am I like this sometimes it can be something from your past that now you're reacting because of something that happened to you and you may be it could be years ago but there's a button and you kept up to it we don't have to be captive to anything we're not called to be captive to anything I mean we are called to be a free people hallelujah so I'm just going to close with that they stand to our feet shall we we have the musicians come I'm glad we are no longer slaves to certain or any such thing amen this is a place of healing brother Jeremy I'm gonna need you to come and help out amen it's gonna let's just pray and if anyone would like pray you're more than welcome to come forward so do you know this let's just drop our contentions and our brawling in our fighting the only one we should be fighting your Satan and the best way to fight her mr. serve the Lord and love him with all your heart that a life surrendered to the Lord completely that lives in sweetness and humility that is the Thunder that shakes the devil I
