tonight can be centered around your word holy spirit we depend on you my father my god we commit everything father gordon and all the hearts of your people and their needs into your precious hands for we know that you are the prayer answering god for we know father god that out of the foolishness of preaching you have saved the souls of men and that is why we commit ourselves to you with all humbleness in the name of our savior our lord jesus christ the name above all name lord god the name of our lord jesus our savior lord jesus christ amen amen amen i greet you this evening tonight in the name of our lord jesus christ can you just get me my glasses in the office there please sorry i forgot my my four eyes may god bless you while we're standing we are going to read uh if brother ed can put that one for us sorry my brother is just all by himself thank you so much musicians brother phil brother marion isaac uh brother kira sister god bless you and thank you for playing the music for us thank you while we're standing we're going to to read the bible because that's that's the only book we've got no law but the bible amen amen we've got no other tradition but the scripture amen we want to speak about the first born the tithing of the lord amen and while we're standing let's read one scripture and then hebrews chapter 12. let's read hebrews chapter 12 i believe that is a verse sorry right hebrews 12 23 amen he prospered 23 sorry i'm already very nervous and i'm reading hebrews 11 instead of hebrews 12 amen and i'm surprised why the scripture has given me something else amen let's read the hebrews i'm trying to go back with this thing that's right sorry right hebrews chapter 12 are we there the bible says in hebrews chapter 12 to the general assembly and the church of the first born which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect hallelujah that is our scripture tonight i believe we can enjoy our sins i just wanna i just want to to get relaxed and settled are you are you fine this evening i like how brother isaac likes to greet didn't he just make everyone relax he said hello is everyone okay so i'd like to copy him tonight is everyone all right everybody had a wonderful day just relax amen and then let's be in the presence of god amen but let's be cautious that in as much as we can be relaxed in as much as we can be comfortable but we are in the presence of the most high god all of you are welcome in the service of the lord but let us pay attention to what the lord might have for us this evening it may not be so much from me because i'm not i'm not a a preacher as you may you may catagorize the preachers i'm just your brother who just come and talk to you but based on what the lord has laid in my heart and i don't even ask to preach he's the pastor who asks me so i find it very difficult for saying no because previously i bent my fingers in so many ways by refusing to do what god wants me to do and that is the only reason why i agree otherwise i was going to say brother there's so many many men in the church who are capable better preachers than me but because the lord puts things in our hearts and the lord wants us we don't want to be like the prophet jonah in the bible and be forced to do the will of god we want to be available and willing to work amen so we have read the scripture and then the lord has laid a thought in my heart for some time now and i've i struggled to to to put it the way that it comes in my heart and i believe today the little bit that i have we can be able to share and and and and enjoy just to encourage you to motivate you to show you exactly who you are because it is only when you understand who you are that you can be able to navigate through the storms of life because if you don't understand and don't know who exactly you are it becomes very difficult it becomes almost impossible because you don't understand who you are you are you are confusing your identity so if you understand and you know who you are in the body of the living god then it's easy to tell the devil to separate between the thoughts of god and the thoughts of the devil because they are all coming fighting in this common battleground as we previously spoke which is the human mind but it can become difficult if you don't know who you are if you don't understand who you are if you can't identify yourself in your name amen so that is the first one and this this church of the firstborn that i'm talking about in all simple times it is you you are going to see how are you you going to are you a firstborn of the living god you of all the people on earth you are going to understand why why would god make you the firstborn why why would god choose you of all the people what did you do nothing what did i do zero i did absolutely minus zero i did minus zero i actually did even worse he still decided to take me off all the good people of all the capable people of all the the willing people willing people yeah he did not bring them in but he decided to bring you in this is a very challenging question brother and sister it is a challenging question because it it it requires me and you to pause it requires me and you to stop and think about why did god choose me for what reason why did god save me why would god out of his powerful mighty eternal elective love sorry choose me why did god do that but that's not our discussion tonight our discussion is to show you that even though you might not get the answer of that question he has chosen you you are his chosen one you me and you and tonight i'm not going to bless you or bang you or be hard on you i'm just going to try my best to show you that you are the firstborn of the living god am i are we together so let's move on and see we've i'm going to if you will tolerate me and allow me i'm going to read those scriptures it's long but that's what our message is about this evening hey this is the anna that's what it is tonight and i would like you the young ones and the older ones please just pay attention as we go deeper try to just put yourself in what is being spoken if you put yourself in what is being spoken if you listen and go with that what is being spoken then you do not lose track of what is coming from the front you do not you cannot find yourself your mind floating elsewhere when you are here physically are we together your body your spirit your soul will be here you will actually be seeing the lord jesus if we say the lord jesus talks to the woman you'll actually be imagining and seeing her him talking to her ah so you won't be hearing the lord jesus but you are saying hey that food whatever can come to your mind so you want you won't float around because that's the job of the devil you the devil will be able to be outside of your thoughts if you just focus on what the lord wants to speak to us tonight amen we have read let me just read that for you quickly that is just a quote not necessarily relevant right now but every word of god is relevant but i just thought of reading it for you before we start that this this is brother branham in god hiding himself in simplicity he says this will just not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of jesus christ in every person that comes amen that's powerful that is so big when every believer comes through the door i must be able to see jesus christ characteristic do you know what is a characteristic a characteristic is something that explains someone it forms part of your personality part of your makeup part of your makeup so every person who comes there i must see the makeup of jesus christ amen in that person who comes there this is an instruction the word of god is an instruction it's not ah you may do it you may not do it no no you must be born again simple so that is the scripture that is the spoken word brother branham says everyone who comes every person who comes in that's how i should perceive that person right let's move on and a concentrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is this is what this build the building that we have or the church or even the structure of a person huh the body is a structure right even the structure of a person no matter how the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people i trust this always be a house of god of beauty because if we cannot be that character if we can't have that characteristic if we cannot see a characteristic of jesus christ in my sister in my brother what are we actually saying to the devil what are we saying to the world why why why why are we here then see it brings so many questions why did i leave everything and come here who forced me to come here if i come and i don't see a character of jesus christ in my brother if i i allow the attitudes that are no that's not that's not my message i didn't plan for this but the point i'm trying to say is if i come here and i do not see you from the bottom of my heart not from at the bottom of my tongue from the bottom of my heart if i cannot see you as a character of jesus christ and take you like that as part of jesus christ why did i come here why do i come here every sunday and every wednesday what am i trying to achieve that is the question that i don't want an answer from you i just want to leave it with you in your hearts to say it does not matter what i see it doesn't jesus christ is promised to be here and he is in his people and that's what i must see yes and operate alone i must operate on that basis and that basis alone i just thought i should just throw that in that we have read and let's read the next one genesis 27 i'll read for you if he's okay so that we can we can hurry up tonight i don't want i don't want to finish late tonight i just want to make sure that um you you said the word of god even if we we one wait is enough from the lord amen so i'll make sure that the time is is said hallelujah i forgot stop watch amen gave up in the book of genesis 27 and jacob said unto his father am i have done according as thy bed as me arrives i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that that thy soul may bless me the key way that i would like you to focus is the statement that says i am iso thy first born it is jacob talking he says i am israel first born and he is not eso but why why is jacob lying to his father that he is the firstborn when he is not what is he why can't he just say i am jacob that second born here's the venison yes you send iso but here is my piece i want you to blame why why does he has to use first born pin code if you can call it why does he want to use that access code of the first born why what what is it in the first ball that that jacob saw that his mother advised him to what is it in there right hold day we'll go to the next scripture and exodus chapter 4 23 20 22-23 and now shall say unto pharaoh that said the lord israel is is my son even mine even my first book and i say unto thee let my son go that he may save me if the if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even die but what is it about this first pawn that's the question i'm asking what is it about this first born why israel is my first born and god is addressing israel as his firstborn he's not addressing the imagination in that veil he said he's my firstborn even my son huh and if you don't want to allow my first one to come out were you pharaoh i'm coming for you yeah why doesn't god say i'll come for your last vote i asked myself this question brother phil why doesn't he say okay if you can't allow i'll come for your first daughter if the daughter is not the first one i'll come for your third bone why doesn't god say that and this is this is the thought that i would like us to take along this thought of the first born the first the importance of the first born the significance of the first ball and this first one i would like to explain to announce to you brothers and sisters that you are that first born but i would like to share with you how important is it why is it so important for god right genesis sorry i've got so many scriptures genesis 48 let's read verse 14 and israel stretched out his hand his right hand his right hand we know the lord is sitting on the right hand of the lord right of god his right hand that's another significance we're not talking about about the right hand tonight but israel which is jacob raises his right hand and then laid it upon ephraim's head ibrahim was the second born of joseph we all know that right who was the younger and and his left hand upon manas head guiding his hands wittingly waiting for manasseh was the firstborn manas was the firstborn right and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he laid up and he held up his father's hand to remove it from ephraim's head and to manaza's head and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the first ball who manasseh are we together put thy right hand upon his head because he's there are we together brothers and sisters we are together and his father refused and said i know it myself i know that he's the firstborn listen to this my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be a great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his head his seed shall become a multitude of nations this last verse i would like you to hold it on the side don't throw it away hold it on the side because this is what is going to this is why i'm going to show you how you come in how me and you come in right because batman ephraim is not the first boy physically speaking but jacob is making him a first born okay let's read romans 8 verse 29 the bible says i've made that one slightly bigger so i can see it for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to to be conformed to the image of his son i was listening to the spoken word the images of christ man go and listen to that to the spoken word you know it's i can't talk about it now but that is powerful but he might be the first born among many brethren my own whom he did procrastinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified there is an image of jesus christ that we me and you need to be conformed to because he is the first born our lord jesus are we together he's the first born you will see in the next uh scripture that will read that he is actually the first born of everything that ever existed the lord jesus he's the firstborn of everything and we will hear later that if the lord jesus is the firstborn and you are part of the lord jesus who are you are we together are we together we are the firstborn by virtue of us being part of jesus christ by virtue of us being predestinated if he is the head i am the head in my house my wife is the body we are one so she's part of me if i'm the first born even if she's the last one she's the firstborn you're not getting me but i'm trying to say that sister pal is the firstborn oh sorry the youngest is speedy sorry i'm trying to say baby is the first born right in the books of god pity is the first born there is no grandchildren great-grandchildren and then cousin of cousin cousin of my mother and sister and the great no no facebook that is why god said he created adam and we were there in the mind of god in that we were there we was going to be created ending is your turn now come not sibling of sorrow and soul no no you just come not you know no you're about 1970 mama you were born you on this birthday no no you come today maggie your time now each one in our own right each one in our own speciality our own uniqueness that is tell us the plan of god for adam to call us into existence but somebody disrupted it and we had to come like this we were now forced to sing happy birthday every year it's not a problem i'm just saying we were brought in this situation because of what happened we were not supposed to come this way we were supposed to come like the real despond i never forget that someone that brother i said preach during zoom you didn't lock down through zoom if i'm not mistaken or it was here change but and brother james also preached a similar someone that talks about amnesia who remembers them if you remember if you can just if now can god can just take this physical mind and and unblock it and you remember exactly what happened i'm telling you brother and sister nothing is going to be nothing is going to be to mean anything for you except that everything is going to come last and what god has done and revealed for you is going to be number one the scripture of matthew or john 24 will be revealed we will every second take love the lord god our god with our soul with our mind with our body with everything amen every second thought will be about him amen and us yes that's right that is what will happen but because this that this that body this this body that paul calls that what does he call it and in thessalonians who are my bible reader sorry this body this dark book this body and he talks about it a.m at last darkly thank you that's the highlight it loves ugly so your bible readers but you didn't know what i'm trying to say i don't mean you're not bible religious you are that last ugly this classically is blocking us from actually seeing what god had us before the foundation of the world so the first one for whom he did for noah he also procrastinated to conform to the image of of his son to conform to the image of his son that he might be that he might be the firstborn among many brethren because jesus christ was the first even physical he was the firstborn of mary imagine jesus christ was the third bone it wasn't going to be it wasn't going to fit because firstly apart from apart from the vision issue that she was supposed to be born by a vision apart from that he was supposed to be the one because the first one meaning is quite a specific significant meaning a first born it does not mean that the second one is not important it does not mean that that the state born or the last born my gabi does not mean they are not important they are important but there is a there is a powerful testimony there is a powerful ministry and a mystery on the first born there is a task there is there is there is a benefit a blessing on the first born who you are tonight how many are happy to be their first boss i'm so happy because i didn't qualify i'm so delighted because i did not i did not even wait it to be a first ball amen let's move on well this is i think this is our last scripture colossians chapter chapter 1 verse 15 who is the image who jesus christ who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every brothers and sisters are we together no sorry i i like to talk like i mean class to to to talk to you so that i can see that we are you are following me who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible do you listen to that whether they are they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him man i'm so happy if everything was created for me remember when i when we talk about jesus christ i talk about you who believes that you are part of jesus christ let me tell you i'm trying to show you that you are god but what is it that is a statement that you know unless you don't understand what god means to be god because that thing says everything visible and invisible dominions everything was created by you because you are in the mind of god you were you were part of that logos you are part of the logos jesus christ and you i cannot be separated how can i separate christ and his head then he won't leave because it will be a heartless body yeah i mean it will it will be a bodyless head and you will be a headless body so i cannot there's no way jesus christ and you you were there at the beginning because before the foundation of the world before creation god you had you in his mind and as we spoke previously god's thoughts are eternal god's thoughts are not like this box or this cell phone no no this is zero this is this can be alienated is that the right word this can be demystified but the thought of god as the thought of god are so real they're so genuine that to think about you just for him to think the trouble that makes you real that makes eternal because god's thoughts are eternal so we are part of him let's listen to that verse what he says our principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things he is before meaning he was first and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body remember we said this in the church who is the beginning the firstborn of the dead that in all things he might have preeminence meaning that the first born from the red meaning that we are not afraid even to die because we can resurrect we can raise and resurrect that is why we are not afraid when the devil challenges us or challenges one of us and take him and they find themselves in the wilderness dying because we believe in resurrection we know that they will come and resurrect that is why we are not supposed to be prisoners to fear it doesn't matter what the devil brings the moment we think about our father the moment we think about who he is what he does the moment we understand who we are everything must be history every challenge they will come it's not one mean challenges are not going to come they will come because we in that focus memorial huh it says everything should mean zero test comes to try us to show and to bring out who we are into reality that's what the tests are for so we need to be able to get to a point where we understand our first born sheep if there's such a way that our firstborn would i don't know which one is the right one but now i want to talk about uh right let's start with that the importance of the firstborn i i've went and researched for a long time about what what what what is the significance of a firstborn in greek sisters in greek in greek greek david in greek the word firstborn came from the word called prototypos that protocols in greek they say it means the first born doesn't always mean the first one in terms of the number or the one who was born first wow are we together it does not always mean that because uh brother jeremy sorry he's not here so i can i can talk about it it has not been because he was the first born and then uh he he would become the firstborn obviously all the time no no otherwise me and you were not going to have a chance because we are not the first one israel was his firstborn israel god chose it and he said he is my first born otherwise me and you we're not going to have a chance if ever it will always come according to our natural number there are people that are first born by a national number and they become first borns in their spiritual meaning right but there are people who are first borns but they do not become firstborns in the spiritual realm according to how god wants it you will see what i'm talking about that was by the way prototypos meant in the ancient greek as they explained the one who was supposed to the one who inherits the one who's chosen to inherit the one who is chosen to take the leadership of the kingdom the one who isn't who is found to be worthy to be qualifying to become the firstborn that is why jacob could stop the heads i mean the hands all right that is why that is why joseph would become a leader but yet he was not jacob's facebook who then was the firstborn physically speaking and he he i'm sure reuben used to tell his father no no papa you are making a mistake i am the firstborn and this boy then jacob told him that no no no and jacob did it later on with joseph's sons by that time joseph should have understood that me i'm even the leader now i'm the ruler right but my uh i'm not the first boy so i shouldn't be arguing with my father when he crosses the hands because he knows what this is how i came at that time joseph yourself joseph joseph was more taking it on the emotional side because physically those were his children manager was supposed to be to take the inheritance and the leadership but no jacob the prophet crossed the hands okay so who is chosen or acknowledged to be the leader that is what the word was mean so it's not does not mean that because i am the firstborn automatically in god's books then i'm the facebook but you'll see as we go along that the physical times there spiritual there are shadows right internationally as we when we grew up in many cultures the firstborn is the inheritor is the one who becomes the king the firstborn is the one who's listened to the most the first one it does not mean that the other children don't get listened it doesn't mean that the first one has quite a certain position in this kingdom the first born that is how things were done but it may be that the father will see that this other child has got wisdom this other child has got a sentence called responsibility this and the father without mentioning that you are demoting you as the facebook he things will just happen and he'll just take a leadership the other child because the national fact he is the first boy you know i've heard some time ago that just to try to emphasize on this point that certain things what they mean is not what they mean they they right now each one of us have got ages we we got a certain age number maybe maybe i'm i'm i'm 23 or i'm 25. and then my friend here penny maybe he's 16. but if at least give him a realistic maybe he's eight right but you may find that the way he conduct himself he's conducting himself like a 12 year old boy the way he's matured he's conducting himself like a 16 year old boy his maturity level right again they also say in biology you know there's our physical years and there's our biology years some of us are maybe 40 or 44 now but you find that hey i'm so gray man i'm actually looking like i'm 50. you know it's possible and if they check my health how it is deteriorated they can say hey yeah actually you're biologically here you're 50 years old is that why why are the scientists is it there in biology is that but you can be so fit and so good mentally in everything but you found that even if you are 16 but in actual effect you are 43 biological so certain things what they mean they don't necessarily mean what we see because the five sense realm always deceives has always have certain limitations there was a lady in the u.s who started to be on this thing what are the sisters call it this thing that is very popular with the with the sisters believers or unbelievers is very important diet diet yes died you still called died that lady she went into a diet from the baby she went into a diet healthy eating she started to eat raw vegetables raw vegetables for a very long time her husband didn't her husband continued like me like many other husbands continued with coke continued with other unhealthy stuff so them for coke will forgive me they must sue me so that lady she was 70 if i'm not mistaken or 75 but she looked like she was 42 or 41. only the voice could tell that this lady ah she's old she was very young but her husband was like her grandfather so now what exactly is her age physically yes she's silent but in actual effect biological she's very young she's very healthy her immune system is very strong she can outrun me and you but you at the same test event huh so the point i'm trying to tell you brothers and sisters is that your firstborn physically you may not be best born in the books of god right that is what happened between jacob and joseph sons that's what happened that's what happened between joseph and his brothers that's what happened between israel and the bride that's what happened you were not the firstborns me and you were crafted in and we were made that was by version of the predestination of god how he planned you see the mind of god it must confuse you the devil mustn't come and ask you but uh but if god knew don't question just believe it because if you can try to understand the mind of god you will never be able to god knew everything and he still allowed things to happen that way he still yes you were chosen yes you were in his mind but he still allowed you to come the way of the second one who became firstborn did anyone get it god allowed it to happen that way because god wanted to show his plan of salvation god wanted to bring out his thoughts god wanted to bring his power to save his power of predestination his elective love to take charge and force that's what god wanted to do between me and you a firstborn second bullet a first one is someone who has the revelation of the birthright if we read about esau who sold his birthright in genesis 32 we will understand that israel led the revelation of the birthright we understand that eso did not understand that he is the firstborn and he must take charge he understood he didn't understand but jacob understood the power and the significance of the first born wood or the first-born ship he understood it that is why he said okay sell it to me and that man gave him a way a worse discount that i've ever come across do you know a discount when you go to the shop to buy things or a customer ask you for a discount batman get sold it to him so cheap cheap church a bowl of what of soup man you should have just asked him to pay more at least we could understand it a bowl of soup yeah eso went so cheap that's how much the level of revelation can take you and me if we don't realize who we are yeah we need to understand and get the revelation and get the gist of who we are then we cannot walk every day and and be angry until the sunset and tomorrow morning we are still angry do you understand who we are we are selling to the devil so cheap to be angry to my sister for the whole week i can't phone sister maggie because she didn't give me a call if you want to enter your house sorry i don't mean it literally [Laughter] i'm sorry but what happened a true believer a true first born understand understand that don't they barely what do you call it now this flesh can pull you can fight you and bring you law sometimes the songwriter said but it will never bring me down yes ideally we were not even supposed to come low no but because we are in this place for god to prove his weight the lord allowed this devil to bring us law sometimes but one thing for sure he will never bring you down even when you are down you must never believe that you are down never confess it i was asking my family a question i said to them tell me if that you walk around the street and you meet the devil and the devil says to you hello hello hi hi he says i'm the devil the very old lucifer liar father of liars i asked them and you can see that yes that's him i say i ask them a question will you believe him and this is not the new doctrine you don't have to believe what i'm saying now you don't have to to believe agree with my answer that's what i mean brother james but mario don't have to agree but this is how i it came to me will you believe him and for sure it's him you see that this is the devil exactly how the bible explained it and you are you have even made sure you have made proof you've proven that this is the devil we don't believe him let me hear will you believe in you i don't want you answered because we've already discussed i i said to them no no me i can't believe it because he is a liar it is me who must tell him that he is the devil i must tell him that hey you devil come here under my feet not him telling me no no no no no no be careful because the devil never means what he says he's a liar in the battle of life it could be that he just wants to swallow you yeah come on the moment the devil will tell you the truth know that there is a lie in there no matter how hidden it can be because he can tell you the truth 99.99.99999999999999999998 0.000001 truth or a lie sorry in the he just put 0.000 a lie in there knowing that god does not take nothing less than 100 percent a clear cut hundred percent god will never take less than that so the devil if he comes to say i am a liar i'm the devil please come with me can you hear me because there's there's an intention behind every devil's statement he does not just speak to you for nothing why would the devil want to waste his time and can come in your mind and talk to you why why why does me and you get evil thoughts or wrong thoughts or angry or anything is the devil at work and we must be aware and alert at all times with the holy spirit must be able to bring us back to the stage when we say hey come on this is the enemy now that is why the lord jesus said to peter get thee behind me satan he was not talking to peter he was talking to the devil was trying to take advantage of his son yeah right amen so that is exactly how we need to approach the devil that is how i'll approach him i'll say you can't tell me you said it you are satan i'm the one who tells you that you are the devil yeah amen and another one can say but you have said exactly how the devil said no i didn't say exactly what the devil said because the devil his intention had lies had males inside me i was telling him the truth that he is the devil him he was because god reached the heart read what you say amen you can tell me hey brother paul i love you and i say oh brother ed oh my brother i forgive you lying with open eyes i said brother you know i love you so much my brother i appreciate you come on when my heart does not mean it that's how capable the devil is he can say hey you know what you are the son of didn't he to the lord he said to the lord that is the son of the most high he said drop yourself and the angel will pick you up why did mata say scripture he's there and psalm is there that his food will not touch the ground the angels will catch him the devil told you but the lord said hey devil get thee behind for it is written you see never believe the devil and no matter how truthful he can sound appear if he says your brother is like this like you say you are a liar was teaching at the camp there tell him put him in his place because behind every devil's word there is a poison there is a poison that me and you must watch out for and be careful whether he talks to you through the sister or through another brother or through your mind directly never believe him that means you must be able therefore to know the sort of god and the thought of the devil and for you to do that you must be in a good position to understand that you are the firstborn how are you going to do you're going to confuse like issue if you don't know who you are if you don't understand who you are children when you go to school there's so many trials and temptations there's so many things but i said to my children and to you all of you my children it doesn't matter what the devil does you see the drivers will understand me when we drive on the road our focus is on the our car that we are driving number one are we together we focus on our car that number one i've got the seatbelt i'm driving within the speed limit and i'm on my lane and i'm on the right side of the road those are the basic things of when i'm driving before i can check what other drivers are doing my car is on the right lane i've got their seatbelt i'm doing the right fit limit i've got a seat belt everybody in the car is going to sit there are you together all i do is to maintain my position to maintain my speed limit if anyone comes and bump it's not my fault right is that person's fault and i can try to avoid the accident but i imagine if i get an accident and i'm i'm out of my position i'm going that way and the cars are going that way yeah what will happen that's how the cops will not even listen to me the police because i'm out of my position yeah you must be fast in your opposition with the seat belt all right with the speed limit the moment the police come and find that oh you made an accident and they see that hi that person who had an incident with you is actually in the room but when they checked with the machines and everything they found that you were doing 200. what will happen yeah yes that person bumped you that person came from there or he came out of his lane and everything but what speed were you doing oh did you have a seat belt why did you fly out of the car if you had a seat there you didn't even sit there that is why i am in the wrong because i was not in my right position that is exactly how me and you should be with the devil let's not confuse the devil our thoughts with the devil's thoughts especially you children because you are at the time where you are changing you are learning you are learning the things of the devil you are watching mama and daddy how they do things you are learning you are praying that's you're growing be careful how that's maintain your position all you do you just drive in your lane within the speed limit you just do everything according to the word of god then you don't have to worry about 2 000 pages of the devil's tricks don't have to worry about those ones all you do you just remain keep your five pages of position then the devil can come and pump you with so many things at the end of the day the great judge our great police officer the target cop will tell him devil you are in the room this one is in position he's got your seatbelt right leg driving within the speed limit sit back everything then he's not in the room you don't go back you are in the room go to jail that's what our judge will do to the devil but you make it difficult for the judge if the judge comes and the judge found that ah you are actually flying in a spirit zone of 50 you ain't doing hundred then you make it even the devil will say you see a lot even the devil he's got the gods he will even say can you see what i told you then he did not take the mercies of god to say no devil i allowed that you see it will take the grace of god now to say no no i allowed that to because my child is going to confess to me listen now then you go to the lord and say lord i'm sorry i confess i made because god if god allows anything in your life it is for a reason and we must be managed and be controlled or be guided by the purpose of god in our lives that is why some threw the waters some through there some through the fire but all through the blood that is why we can never come through the same experiences right and those experiences god allowed them i like what isaac thought because it really it really moved inside me to realize that okay i was just dramatizing in my mind thinking that okay and god said okay you go now you go when we go home we're going to realize that my my my mind has been a long journey things have always been like this but we are not aware you see that is what is going to happen let's take the third bullet jesus was the first born physically to marry so was brother branham i like that brother brandon was also the firstborn he was the first boy even me i'm the firstborn at home but that means nothing what means something is that you are the firstborn also right now because to be a first body physically is of less significance right to be the first one physically is of less significance it may be important i agree but what's the word fight i don't have a better way persevere to be a first born spiritually because that is the most significant and important first bond sheet that you need to to fight for joseph was not the physical firstborn to jacob but he was made by god to be a leader but by predestination and elective love that's how god made it from the onset david also david also was a perfect example allah is born physically but he becomes the king the one whom today will talk about among big brothers capable intelligent well structured people who who were like like soul men they were great men but david god produced needed him to be there i can say spiritual firstborn confidently speaking i can say that way because that's how god made him to be and god used him throughout saint joseph there joseph sons as we have read in the scripture are we together so israel was made blind for you and for me we were crafted in i know these things you know them the purpose is to refresh you tonight we click on the computer then we click refresh why so that the computer can update the computer can save things the computer can do everything must be up otherwise if the demo comes you are going to lose everything that you timed the whole day imagine imagine mama chisol you don't save that chapter it's a problem you always must click refresh in fact they make the computer nowadays to have an auto save in my days we used to have you must always click save save save otherwise you lose thousands and thousands of spreadsheets having a lot of work and that's how the devil went he wants you to work so hard at the end he just confused the computer and it freezes and you lose everything that you have worked for all your efforts all your dedication everything be careful young people the devil wants you to lose all the data that you you have worked so hard for the devil wants to lose your best life the devil wants you to lose a free gift of life to be born in the message family many people who are not born in the message family many i was privileged to be born but i also realized late man that i was so blessed i was so in the lab in the world till i was so lucky you children you are so blessed to be born by believing brothers that's right because mothers and fathers because you are like someone who already somebody has run a race for you you are taking it halfway through so your job is to run as if you are dead and run faster before the devil catches you that's what you young people must do and that's what all of us should do because the lord jesus has already done it for us the real first born has already done it for us me and you we got this message for free we got this word for free he we never went looking for god amen we never never none of us went out with his own effort god came looking for us and he found us and he brought his way to us and he pulled us no brother indeed it was him amen who pulled you and you didn't understand yourself but eventually you realize that oh my i'm a son of the living god that's what happened to me and to you that's what happened therefore brothers and sisters it is important for us to understand the meaning of the firstborn let's hear what the prophet says there let's get to the second point the first point that we were talking about what's about the first board so let's talk about the tithes of the lord brother branham in the spoken word uh images of christ oh there i have it i forgot he says oh lord you are god and your god forevermore and we are so happy to know that you've you promised that you would have a remnant when you come to earth to the earth regardless of what goes or comes there is going to be people that's going to be ready we know that there is this there is a tithing that man gives to god and there is a tight thing amongst the people now this is now what fascinates me i spoke to brother then i can't remember the ending about these types many times we talk about tithes and then we give our tithes in church which is wonderful that's a scripture that's an obligation by the way that's on the physical side but it is called spiritual meaning as i said the physical types they're spiritual there are shadows and types right listen listen the shadow of jesus christ physically was so powerful in the shadow the shadow of the lord jesus some people they just wanted even just to touch a shadow and be healed that lady who wanted to touch the helm of hitman she didn't want to greet him and hug no she just wanted to touch the hem right some people the apostles they were just walking and people just touched their shadows and they got healed so how much more about the shadow of the lord jesus christ how much more about this shadow that is called the new and the old testament the things that are happening in the old testament the shadows are powerful men because they come from the mouth of god but they are still shadows but they are powerful right now is enticed and we pay tithes and and did you know that you and me are the tithes of god amen we are the times of god you know we and we are not the ned tithes we are the gross i don't know does any one of you want to be a gross type i i want to be a i mean i want to be a net i i'm not bringing i'm not i'm not here to encourage you to to go cross or native because there's people argue about that but i am a gross tithe you choose which ties you want if you are the type of eyes of god you you choose whether you want to be a gross or a name but me i'm a gross all right because because can i tell you why can i tell you what because you jesus christ did not pay you as a tithe amen he did not bring half of you and the power he brought you complete without reservation he brought you a full fresh tithe before the father and he said this is my time you are the the the lord jesus you are also that she so i'm not saying go now and change your you can do it but i'm just saying gross or ned it's up to you i want to be the growth if if we agree as the prophet says today that perhaps maybe we would say a tenth of all the world's harvest through the ages will be the elect that has been called that means the bride is the tigers the pride is the tithe of the lord the pride abraham gave time to melchizedek all our forefathers have paid tithes now when when they were paying tithes through their harvests through their uh plowing and that i remember my father paying a cow and he called the deacons to come and say the one that come he didn't say no no i want to give that one no i learned from the from him that time he said you can't come the tenth cow is the tithe of the lord and he gave it to the church that was a great lesson for me he allowed the cows to come out of the kettle i'm in the crawl they come one by one that the one that came number 10 is it is that one the lord chose for himself but nowadays we want to say no no no you just look at the one that is skinny over and you want to give the lord a skinny one i don't know time to be hard on you but that skinny one to me looks like the net i'm sorry to say that just eat the meat and leave the bones are we together the point that i'm trying to bring to you is that we need to do the best of the best for the lord if the tithes is the bride if abraham paid tithes what portion did abraham if abraham did abraham pay gross on it and that's not my sermon tonight about grosses and nets and all that i don't know why i keep on emphasizing money but the point is up in those days there was no tax in that sense so how how how did they give to the lord when they harvested 100 bags of meat of course i'm a farmer now here brother phil i i make 1 000 picks and now i want to convert it to because nowadays i have to deal with cash isn't it i must convert those picks to cash so that i can fight for the lord but had it been literal peaks how was i going to deduct cross or how it was going to be gross but now when i catch those peaks of mine to cash now i want to are we together that's not the point the point is perhaps maybe we would say a tenth of all the world's harvest through the ages will be the elected that's been called today we are the tithes of the lord brothers and sisters and the lord did not limit his hand he gave us everything because we are the bride because we are the tithe of the lord he he made sure that that church will be without spot without wrangle without blame without the christian mark from the devil i taught myself from a young age that if there's anything that i don't understand for the lord for example issues of ties and everything and arguments and we don't know we debate people who can spend sleepless nights debating and all our argument will make sense now we can debate that and we can listen at the end of the day it's going to be who has got the most powerful reasoning capacity is the one who wins right but the point of the matter is that if i don't understand or i don't get things isn't it let's say let's say let's say let's let me use another this same example of time let's say about ties and everything and then i say no no but i can't okay okay i don't understand gross or not i mean i called me and said to me they're at your church not here i was begging south africa fellowship in some way hey brother calls me and say because his wife was fellowshipping there he was not fellowshipping them and i was trusting at the time he says how are you managing the tithes because he was not happy i said no my brother the lord the holy spirit must guide you i can't tell you how and then he said no but you are doing you are telling people to do gross i said no no no we are not you're not you need to speak to your wife perhaps then then we can address it the two of you because i cannot address issues of your family or personal revelation for you and for your wife and everything but the point of the matter is that if you don't understand there's an argument i give you two choices the first one we are not sure about is what i must be made the final one is what that must be gross and if you do not the bible says if you do not and then you find at the end that you are wrong are you going to reverse now when we are already on the other side but you are safe if you can go gross and you find that you were wrong you are still safe the lord will say what a wonderful child you are because you you you you did what you called you mitigated your risk so well to say hi i'm not sure but if it is led then it's fine because of doing it to the lord but it is it is gross so what i want to say is that if it is gross and then i given him lead and i found to be wrong now then i cannot reverse now what i'm trying to say to you let's come to the spiritual let's stop thinking about money physical let's come to the spiritual now let us give the lord cross of our lives yes let's give the lord gross of everything that we have let's not limit the lord spiritually now i'm talking about right i'm not talking about salaries let's talk about the growth of spiritual lives let's give the lord full maximum more if possible because you will be blessed for going what you call it an extra mile for the lord the lord won't punish you the lord won't blame you for giving him grace but the lord will ask you why did you do so little when you could have done so much the lord will ask you and say my boy my daughter why i'm not happy with you you say hey lord yeah man i was busy hey no no no no no no no no it's ending he made me angry no his sister bro when he didn't talk to me properly when i could have given gross and encapsulated her with my love and and forgiven her unconditionally and i loved her without her telling me that she asked for forgiveness love her oh my brother my sister i don't know why i keep on talking about loving it you know it's just that it comes so strong to me that love even people who just call themselves christians who just denominational people they know that the love of god is so great they make even songs and say love can change the world if sun can t sun can turn into a if sand can turn into a pearl or a sister if pelican sun can turn into policy beautiful name sand can turn into pearl and a coal can turn into diamonds and they make poems and say love can change the world yeah they are just talking about love physical love you know loving one another how much the love of god can do i'm closing now when the negatives becomes the positives again when nothing becomes something that is what happens all the negatives when they become positives we start to see our reality of being the firstborn we start to understand he cometh from like a flower and is cut down he inflates also as a shadow and a continuous note that is job chapter four if i'm not mistaken i think it's job chapter four i forgot to put it there but now we are leaving a shadow life here and we must understand that there's coming a time of reality this reality that we are living here brother ben taught us that the real reality is coming and we are just on the shadows of it right now when we are on the shadow we are so close i've never seen a shadow that is far from this object a shadow is so close when when i do this my shadow also do this when i jump my shadow jumps that is the shadow it gives you a true reflection of reality a shadow so ah while we are here in this life being a shadow shadowing the real love that is coming the reflection must be of reality all the time are we together the shadow cannot be able to do something and then the reality do something we reflect heaven while we are here everything happens as if we are already in that is why we say we are in the bright age we fly high like eagles because we our shadow takes from some way that is what's happening now i want to show you for those for those who are who are older will know that picture you see in those days we used to have where's my picture here in those days we used to have that thing that is there on the board you see that that's the shadow we used to have you see how many knows this thing young people who who knows this one this is for the the young guys when do you know it for sure yes what is this hurry i'm gonna tell you tonight my girl i'm going to tell you what this is this is a shadow it's what we call a negative of reality it's a negative of a shadow in the early days our cameras were not digital they were not taking you a selfie now and you print now already digitized no everything was manual and we had shadows this is called a negative film that comes from a from a film membrane that is a big role that was in the film and you take pictures and you move pictures and they improve the then it goes to be developed when it goes to be developed on my shadow is why are you there sorry there is worry there on the picture there but that's why you look ah even now you can't tell me you can't tell me what is this child doing you can see is she wearing a blue or a red shirt that child huh is what what is that thing she who what's this one why is the eye for this one like that why because it's a shadow yeah there are eyes i can see even that t-shirt is striped that looks like a beautiful house i don't know if it's day or night only the reality can tell you because that is a shadow all right so i said my wife must bring me the pictures and i i just sent my any pictures i'm sorry i should have said the ones within it with clear images you see then we will take these images yes we print them from a developer and you come with yeah an image like this those days we didn't have computers to put this we put this in photo albums big ones and small ones these ones like this it comes out like this you say ah what's that brother more on that picture i thought it was his brother on the shadow because the shadow will never tell you exactly right but you can see that ah that resemblance looks like brother moon that one looks after the bend that one looks like sister brother p you can see that ah yeah but what is only when the printout comes then you see the reality of the shadow but meanwhile the shadow shows a little bit of this because everything that is in that shadow is going to come on the picture are we together that is the picture of earth and we love our earth just that is getting destroyed but we love it it's a beautiful planet we love it but it's just part of the shadow that of the earth that is coming yeah it's only a picture it's only a shadow the real earth is not gonna look like this i don't think so the bible says there will be no seas isn't it so it's not gonna look like that you see there they see everywhere waves they're angry you can see angry way pacific may be somewhere i can't see i can see this is africa maybe we are down here in new zealand somewhere under they call it and we are the eh the real that is coming it's not like this but why i'm showing you this picture i'm just trying to tell you that brothers and sisters me and you are small we are absolutely small and we are absolutely can i say nothing until the lord jesus christ came amen you're nothing so nothing we are that even our own earth that one is absolutely nothing looking who knows that picture that picture that picture they say is that is the image of our galaxy our galaxy is a body of billions and billions of planets and bodies in this in the universe there we are part of it our solar system is part of it our solar system is part of that galaxy that that galaxy is so huge that to move from that point to that point they say you will take 100 years one hundred thousand years sorry one hundred thousand years to travel and you know how fast must you be traveling you must be traveling at a speed of 186 000 a mile per second which is the speed of light you must be traveling at 186 000 miles a second to travel from there today and do you know what in there in that planet in in that galaxy there is before we go there this galaxy there is many other galaxies billions of them oh my this makes you mad now there is billions of these galaxies billions nobody will ever reach them they just think and tell us an imaginary picture and say maybe send pictures and and then build up an image like that this could be closer to the reality but there are billions and billions and billions of other galaxies now our solar system is maybe in this area here somewhere and you know where is our earth our earth is here you see this dot this distance this one is here somewhere there sorry i can't expand it further but this one that we love so much it's there it's there and can i tell you something inside there that earth day there is you hey man and there is me on that door today maybe i can cover even our earth with my with my hand there is earth there where i put my hand in that earth that can be covered by this on that image there is me so how small am i i'm not trying to make you like small i'm just trying to help you to realize that you are small and i am small i'm just trying to assist you that i am very small but let me tell you the good news the good news is my lord jesus my lord jesus your lord jesus have seen that smallness and then he decided to come and dwell in that smallness to make you the first born now you are bigger than the billions and billions and billions of universes you are going to travel with the speed maybe more than life when we go home because that's the fastest we know now we're not dead now but when we go home sister vanessa we are going to travel perhaps more than that so which means we are even going to see our own universes that's what you are isn't it something that we are supposed to be grateful for that is why this video of this guy when i watched it i cried man because he described me so well he explained it so nice and i was waiting for an opportunity you know to tell you about it because it's so much powerful it's so powerful that in this nothingness that i am god decided to make me to make you something to never ever underestimate what is inside you yeah if you undermine yourself or you disregard yourself just do me a favor one favor at least respect and uplift your god that is in you hallelujah because there is a god inside you he needs to be comfortable he needs to be happy he need to produce things inside your life therefore i don't have time to make him uncomfortable i don't have the time to make god uncomfortable in my life amen if i fault her i must stand up amen if you fought up you stand up and say lord i can't not after having done this not after having done what you have done i don't believe they'll ever discover how big the universe is that's right i i personally think and this is not a new doctrine but i think it is it's endless right i don't want to say eternal but that's what it means i don't think your universe will ever finish it because the negatives types there in my view in my books i don't think they'll finish the universe but they'll find out that the universe starts from here and here i don't think you'll ever find it i think it's so fast it symbolizes eternity of god because nobody will ever exhaust the eternity of god and that is your life man when i come to you with a check this is yours like eternal life yours and it's given to you and and that is by the god who makes these things who made these things the bible says he spoke and they came out of his mouth all those things i mean who is mankind yeah that me and you who is the devil to trick you to be allowed to be to trick me and you no he must never be given that opportunity let me die in my boots fighting let me die and that's my message for tonight brothers and sisters that let us realize who we are yeah let's understand maybe some other time the lord will give me more about this fascinating first born ministry or mystery that i love so much the way i love you so much the first time i met vanessa i told her here in new zealand it was just a few days and we were chatting and my brother chris remember my sister and i was sharing with her about the firstborn because it just moves me and i don't know how to express it i was preaching to my daughter many years ago we were driving going somewhere in south africa we were driving i think i was going to drop here somewhere i said you know what let me tell you something can i preach to you she says yes then i start to preach to her about the purpose of the first born and what it means so you are not just people yeah me and you are not just people not with pride because pride is not found in the first born no pride but you are just saying who you are yes that's who you are that's who i am and nobody can change it no devil can change you so have you said that i'll repeat the voice over the bell if you are going to fight a battle and you you are told that before you start you have one how is how are you going to react you before you start they say are you don't worry that's your crown that one is your crown but you need just for project call you know phil you have to run you just have to run this race no for protocol but you have already been given this is already yours let's just give you a taste then they just give you a taste you say this is when i touch it when you touch it you know that's how brother brandon went overview in the kitchen of time he was going to touch what you're going to have for us and then you know we said you men of god you went there he said yes he's just giving the earnest that's the feeling these bodies can't take if he gives us all now but once we change our bodies that's what you're going to get how will you react if they tell you no you have won the battle already i'm telling you you'll pray every day you read your bible every day without feeling compelled just with excitement and happiness you'll pray because when i think of the goodness of jesus and all he has done for me my very soul cries out hallelujah praise god for saving me because nothing can stop you when you think of the goodness of jesus this little mind of mine when he thinks of death my great mind propels me that nothing should discourage you you should always know pasta when you are down there in the south island that i am a daughter of the most high god last story when we go home a young man who was taken to slavery to slavery in america the prophet talks about him they took him by force together with other people and they were taken to a land far off in america and he was a slave with other slaves beaten no more hope and for going back home to your motherland sure that you're going to die here because there was no airplane perhaps there was nothing you were trapped he was a slave but you know what this young man when he was there he did not walk like a slave he did not talk behave like a slave he did not conduct himself like a slave no no no no until another buyer came to buy slaves he he chose that i want to buy that slave and the owner said no no no no that one is not for sale he said no no why i want to buy him he said no i'm dead serious i don't want your money i'm sure he added more money right he said no i don't want last one is not for sale he said just tell me why do you treat him special have you trained him he said no i did nothing to him do you give him special food he said no no no he eat just like all other slaves so why is he like that he said my friend it took me a long time also to realize but when i came to realize i realized and i saw that that young man where he comes from back in his mother country in his home country he is a son of a chief or a ki so when he's here in slavery land he behaves himself and conducts himself like a son of the king when he walks when he talks when he do everything he behaves like the son of the king you know david david was not ashamed in front of the multitudes of israel to say i am sorry me your king i have sinned before god right and i don't deserve any better i deserve to be punished and to die that was the attitude of the son of king so that young man he walked talked everything he did as if he was at home because he knew that where i come from my father i'm a king at home he knew that i'm a son of the king and me as the firstborn when my father dies i am the king i might be here in slavery land i might die here but back home my name is raining high so you could be here but there's a much bigger hope than that slavery slave boy because you very soon he promised that he's coming next year this time i'm coming for you be ready you know the story of cinderella how many noises next year i come you must be ready therefore whenever she was working doing everything she was conducting himself like i said queen a queen that is my message by the grace of god this evening because you are the first ones you are the tithes of god you have been punished properly with pride good pride to the lord here am i lord i am your tithe so that the lord can use you to bring tens and thousands of other souls to his kingdom for his honor and for his glory that is the god who made that our god let's leave hands for the lord jesus amen amen i've just got 11 minutes out after one hour so forgive me then it's a beautiful song before we pray that says by his grace if the musicians can come please by his grace i will prevail by his grace i will prevail we sing it three or four times just guide me then we repeat say by his love i will prevail by his love i will prevail i will prevail i will overcome by his love i will prevail if you don't know it just
