[19:48] I mean God bless you all it's great to
[19:51] have Yvonne here tonight let's turn to
[19:55] Genesis chapter 6 I'm going to read a
[19:57] couple of scriptures here and then with
[20:00] them we're gonna go to Psalms 100 and
[20:03] 133 then we have a time of Prayer if we
[20:15] speak for just um just briefly but so
[20:18] I'm sorry Genesis 16 verses thought 13
[20:23] and 14 and God said unto Noah the end of
[20:33] all flesh has come before me for the
[20:35] earth is filled with violence through
[20:37] them and behold I will destroy them with
[20:41] the earth make their ark of gopher wood
[20:43] rooms shalt thou make in the Ark and
[20:46] shalt pitch it within and without with
[20:48] pitch let's go to Psalm 133 verse 1
[21:02] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[21:05] for brethren to dwell together in unity
[21:07] it is like the precious ointment upon
[21:10] the head which ran down upon the beard
[21:13] even Aaron's beard that it went down to
[21:15] the skirts of his garments as a Jew of
[21:17] Hermon and as a Jew that descended upon
[21:20] the mountains of Zion for there the law
[21:22] commanded the blessing even life
[21:24] forevermore I mean let's bow our heads
[21:27] in a word of Prayer if you ever need
[21:29] just want to raise your hand to God
[21:30] while we're in his presence Lord Jesus
[21:32] we are so thankful that we can sing into
[21:36] us as more than a song it's a reality

[21:41] us here dear God we've heard that we've
[21:43] heard your call from another dimension
[21:45] law from glory and thank you you put
[21:47] something in us to respond to your word
[21:49] and say Lord Jesus thank you for making
[21:51] a way that we can come home Lord to wash

[22:58] blessings upon the word and be at those
[22:59] who couldn't be here tonight as well
[23:01] Lord we lift them into your presence by
[23:03] prayer as well and Jesus Christ name
[23:04] Amen and then god bless your friends you
[23:07] may have your seats what I want to speak
[23:10] very quickly about we we have a job to
[23:12] do
[23:12] now we read there in Genesis chapter 6
[23:15] where where
[23:16] I was instructed to to build the Ark and
[23:19] and we understand that Noah the the the
[23:22] would that he got it was very porous you
[23:25] know if you put it in water it just
[23:26] absorbs all the water and you know
[23:28] absorbs everything that's around it but
[23:30] the pitch that he actually sealed the
[23:33] Ark worth kept the world out and it
[23:35] became a it actually change the
[23:37] properties of that wood from being very
[23:39] porous to being actually very strong
[23:41] that it could withstand anything that
[23:43] would bump against it and it's exactly
[23:44] what has happened to us you know the
[23:47] scripture says that men are like trees
[23:48] you know he says you know we'll be like
[23:52] trees planted by the water side and you
[23:55] know even I think Balaam said about
[23:56] Israel they're like ello trees and you
[23:58] know and and and as Jesus when he would
[24:00] heal the blind man one of them and Andy
[24:03] Andy and he told the blind man to look
[24:05] he says I see ministries and he prayed
[24:07] for again he looked normally so men are
[24:10] his trees now we were once built in a
[24:13] certain way where we could absorb
[24:14] anything of this world we were porous
[24:16] you know the whatever wind of doctrine
[24:18] would come whatever spirit was moving
[24:20] through the country whatever was
[24:21] trending I mean we would just adopt that
[24:23] trend we'd become one with it because we
[24:25] were porous but then even before that
[24:28] ever happened the Lord prepared himself
[24:30] a tree and he took that tree and he cut
[24:33] that tree down he took the SAP out of
[24:35] that tree a manatee poured it into all
[24:37] many other trees amen so that we are now
[24:40] like the Lord so now we don't absorb a
[24:43] min the world
[24:44] holy there's something that's covered us
[24:46] inside and out they meant to keep the
[24:48] world out and brother Brown would say
[24:49] about about the are cases he says you
[24:53] know but let's notice then that God told
[24:55] Noah to pitch this Ark put pitch in it
[24:58] on the inside and on the outside both
[25:01] sides well then I've seen what picture
[25:03] was made out if it was a pine tree a
[25:05] hard tree that was cut down an evergreen
[25:07] tree ever a live tree oh yeah our Lord
[25:10] is a he's alive forevermore I mean I hey
[25:13] men and it was cut down and they beat
[25:15] the tree with a beating iron until they
[25:17] beat the rosin out of it and they put
[25:18] the rosin in a pot and boil it until it
[25:21] became real real hot and then this hot
[25:23] rossum was poured upon this gopher wood
[25:25] and it open it just soaked it in and it
[25:27] become full of this rosin
[25:29] and when it once full of that rosin it
[25:31] settled and setup it was harder than
[25:33] steel and I thought that sent Lord get a
[25:36] good old open-hearted person and pour in
[25:39] that pitch which is the Holy Ghost into
[25:41] the believe with the Holy Spirit and
[25:43] fire until they're so soaked full
[25:45] they're not their selves anymore then
[25:48] she can blunt the waves bump against the
[25:50] logs knock them out of the way keep on
[25:52] going hallelujah the only thing that can
[25:54] stand the judgments today is a
[25:56] born-again Christian filled with the
[25:58] Holy Ghost God heat the holy God hid the
[26:03] Spirit of God and poured it upon them
[26:05] and soaked us his whole being full amen
[26:08] I like that need then he can really
[26:10] shove out and into the devil's territory
[26:12] without looking left or right he's
[26:14] talking about you I mean you've been
[26:16] filled with an oil hallelujah that
[26:18] changed your properties of your life
[26:19] where once you absorbed everything
[26:21] everything in this world but God poured
[26:23] in oil and do you hardly think I'm
[26:25] harder than steel you can you can be
[26:27] pushed out to the devil's territory come
[26:29] what way I mean you just go straight
[26:31] through hallelujah I mean without
[26:34] looking left or right I mean that's what
[26:36] the believer is he's actually poured he
[26:38] soft hard and God just pours him full of
[26:41] divine love that he can brace the divine
[26:44] judgments that God's it I mean I mean
[26:46] the divine judgments that sent of God
[26:48] and it carried Noah through
[26:50] now you could individually if you take
[26:53] the ark just for a brief moment you
[26:55] could take each individual but a wood
[26:57] that will comprise that ark you could
[26:59] fill it with pitch and it would float
[27:01] but it had to come together to contain
[27:04] life the ark had to be built for life to
[27:07] be preserved and it's the same thing I
[27:10] mean with a body of believers you know
[27:13] all of us I believe by God's grace and
[27:16] if you haven't been I pray by the end of
[27:18] this meeting you will be we're being
[27:20] filled with the Holy Ghost I mean we'll
[27:22] be made new creatures in Christ God has
[27:23] changed us he's changed our very nature
[27:26] to match his nature I mean by the spirit
[27:29] within us so we will go above the
[27:30] judgment just like the ark did but I
[27:33] mean but as individually and your just
[27:35] as individuals I mean we could never
[27:37] hold life as much as a body now we
[27:42] right there in psalms 133 I'm not gonna
[27:45] be very long on these remarks bro just I
[27:47] just pray we would we would look at you
[27:49] know we're here for a reason we're here
[27:52] for a divine reason we're not here just
[27:54] to go through a religious act but we're
[27:56] here for a reason and the reason and and
[27:59] we still have a purpose upon the earth
[28:00] that's the reason time are still going
[28:02] on the rapture hasn't happened yet the
[28:05] bride has a purpose and we're going to
[28:07] get into the rhythm we're going to get
[28:09] into that purpose a god what is the your
[28:11] will for my life right now and we notice
[28:14] when we read in Psalm 133 I trust you
[28:16] notice it anyway it says how pleasant it
[28:18] is for brethren to dwell together in
[28:20] unity and David would pick that up and
[28:22] say unity it says it's like the pressure
[28:24] precious ointment upon the head that ran
[28:26] down upon the beard even Aaron's beard
[28:29] that went down to the skirts of his
[28:31] garment so now Aaron we understand was
[28:34] the high priest he had to be anointed to
[28:37] fulfill the high priests office I mean
[28:39] he was like any way any other man but
[28:42] God called him for a specific role and
[28:44] we know the high priest wing and once a
[28:46] year into the Holy of Holies with the
[28:49] blood on behalf of the people no other
[28:51] priest could do it no one else could do
[28:53] it it was him but he had to be anointed
[28:56] to fulfill his role upon the earth and
[28:58] the Apostle I mean sorry
[29:00] David is saying here that unity among
[29:03] the Brethren must be there in order for
[29:06] the body to fulfill its role he is
[29:08] likening unity in a body as the same as
[29:11] Aaron being anointed to fulfill the role
[29:13] of the high priest
[29:14] so saying this is why it's so pleasant
[29:16] for brethren to dwell together in unity
[29:17] they can fulfill their purpose upon the
[29:21] earth more than just being a group of
[29:23] people gathered more than just a church
[29:25] but they can fulfill God's divine call
[29:27] amen in their lives that's how that's
[29:30] how important unity really is amen and
[29:35] it's more than and I'm not talking about
[29:36] unity for the sake of it but when
[29:38] brother L says we're in the revelation
[29:40] you get those people together when
[29:41] revelation is flowing in harmony you
[29:44] watch it then winner where the
[29:45] revelation of the word not thee not the
[29:47] mental understanding not a conformity to
[29:49] something but when God divinely reveals
[29:51] himself to a people you get those people
[29:53] together they should recognize the
[29:56] living word and each other and if you
[29:58] can recognize God the word and one
[30:01] another then you can work together you
[30:04] know I was thinking about the Ark you
[30:05] know some of the Ark you know some of it
[30:08] was very big bits of timber you had that
[30:09] you had to kill a big bit of timber you
[30:11] you had the ribs very big bits of timber
[30:13] but then you said very small bits and
[30:16] something you may never ever see but it
[30:18] had a job just like when you build a
[30:20] house every bit of Timbers important
[30:22] it's got a roll and and David would say
[30:25] I'd rather be a doormat or a doorkeeper
[30:27] in the house of God I mean them then
[30:29] dwell in the tents of the wicked so he's
[30:31] saying I don't care what part I am as
[30:33] long as I'm part of the body it's the
[30:35] same thing with the Ark you know ff1 but
[30:38] it would could recognize the other bit
[30:39] we're all part of this ark for the
[30:41] saving of people's lives I mean it
[30:43] wouldn't matter where they were fit and
[30:45] the and the boat as long as our part of
[30:47] the boat it's the same thing I could be
[30:49] a little bit of wood under a step
[30:51] somewhere I don't care as long as I'm
[30:52] part of the boat then I'm happy because
[30:55] I have a purpose amen and we all have a
[30:57] purpose doesn't matter what part of the
[30:59] body it is we all have a purpose I mean
[31:02] like I think I've said before you know
[31:03] you may never ever think about the
[31:05] smallest bone in your little toe until
[31:07] you hurt your toe amen and then you
[31:10] realize that bone has great importance
[31:13] amen it's like yes yo some parts of the
[31:16] body you see other parts you don't see
[31:18] but it's the hidden parts that are the
[31:19] most important parts I mean but every
[31:22] part every joint supplies the need now
[31:27] Aaron Aaron would be instructed in
[31:29] numbers chapter 16 and maybe I'm just
[31:33] jumping here to myself but they all say
[31:35] there was a dispute came up with Cora
[31:38] and Dathan and then and then de 'then
[31:40] and cora thy swallowed up by the earth
[31:41] and and but still the influence of those
[31:44] men upon the congregation of israel they
[31:47] even said to Aaron and Moses you've
[31:49] killed the people of God and God just
[31:50] got fed up with the children of Israel
[31:53] he says I'm just going to consume them
[31:54] in a moment
[31:54] and there was a plague plague begin to
[31:57] fall among Israel and and and Matt and
[32:00] Aaron and Moses fell upon their faces
[32:01] then Moses said to Aaron take a sensor
[32:05] put fire then in from off the altar and
[32:07] put on incense and go quickly into the
[32:09] Congre
[32:10] gation and make an atonement for them
[32:12] for their a stress going out from the
[32:14] Lord the plague has begun now we know
[32:16] there is a death plague in this day I
[32:18] mean there's a death plague in this day
[32:20] and Aaron took as Moses commanded I ran
[32:23] into the midst of the congregation and
[32:25] behold the plague was begun among the
[32:27] people and he put on incense and made an
[32:29] atonement for the people and he stood
[32:31] between the dead and the living and the
[32:33] plague was stayed this was part of
[32:35] Aaron's job to stand between the living
[32:37] and the dead this is how important his
[32:39] role was he took that sense of filled
[32:41] her with incense we know incense is the
[32:43] prayers of the people you've got to
[32:45] recognize how powerful your prayers are
[32:46] I mean your prayers can change the world
[32:49] your prayers can change a nation your
[32:50] prayers can change history that one
[32:54] person in the hands of God can change
[32:55] the world I mean you better look at
[32:57] yourself and say God you've called me
[32:59] for this hour you've called me for a
[33:00] reason I mean it doesn't matter how
[33:02] small you think you are you're important
[33:04] to God holy is to Aaron with the center
[33:06] I mean this this the sense of instance
[33:09] he stood between the dead and the living
[33:11] to stop the plague I mean that's how
[33:13] important it is I mean not to look at
[33:15] people with a critical way but to
[33:17] recognize you've got the prayer of faith
[33:18] I mean you can stand between the living
[33:21] and the dead I mean you can stand there
[33:23] in the brief between the people and stop
[33:24] the plague of death striking hallelujah
[33:26] that's how important you are I mean it's
[33:30] not just a casual thing to pray I mean
[33:32] your prayers have more power than God
[33:34] then and I can't you're talking to them
[33:36] Harley because you've been redeemed by
[33:39] the blood Amen you God's love has been
[33:41] poured out upon you you're very
[33:42] important to God hallelujah so you've
[33:45] got to recognize your prayers are
[33:47] important the devil will think that you
[33:50] not getting nowhere but heaven is moving
[33:52] on the account of your prayers you say
[33:55] well my prayers don't mean too much
[33:56] there was a man and a woman
[33:58] there were Israelis living in earth
[34:00] living in Egypt one day and they begin
[34:02] to read description they begin to
[34:03] recognize the delivery was going to come
[34:05] and
[34:06] and and ramen and and Jakob ate I think
[34:09] was the woman's name you know and RAM
[34:11] was so consumed and he would brother
[34:13] bran would tell us he would yes there's
[34:15] a slave and he'd go work in the fields
[34:17] would they he'd get beaten he'd get what
[34:19] are you mistreated but he had come home
[34:21] and he'd go up on the housetop and he'd
[34:24] begin to call out upon Jehovah God and
[34:26] call that say God where's this delivery
[34:28] of your promise you said we'd be in the
[34:31] promised land the time is coming to an
[34:33] end we're not we can't stay here no more
[34:35] because your word says we're leaving and
[34:37] and Jakob it would Sam ma'am wait what
[34:41] are you you know you're so tired you're
[34:43] so wore out you're so you know why don't
[34:45] you let someone else Prairie says no but
[34:46] the but I've got the burden I'm in the
[34:49] burdens mine I know sure but you know he
[34:51] was stirred up because he saw a prophecy
[34:53] was going to be fulfilled in his day and
[34:55] so he he was there calling on God and
[34:58] then God came hallelujah and answered
[35:01] their prayers and Berthe deliver into
[35:04] their house I mean they had Moses
[35:06] hallelujah that's how important I mean
[35:08] his name wasn't written in the scripture
[35:10] but he was part of that prophecy and God
[35:12] moved on his heart I mean those hard
[35:14] people was just a sincere heart to God
[35:17] God meets that heart well you say well
[35:20] we just we just coasting along no we're
[35:23] not this year I pray will be different I
[35:26] mean we'll just have more than just
[35:28] church in a nice time no I pray this
[35:31] this year is different I mean you got to
[35:33] recognize that your God has built lead
[35:36] for a certain way at the body just like
[35:37] I said on Wednesday I mean last week I
[35:40] was talking to Christine on the phone
[35:41] and my girls are singing in the
[35:43] background as they're driving and
[35:44] heavenly armor will enter the land the
[35:46] battle belongs to Lord and I was walking
[35:48] in the car Plomin sook she she comes
[35:50] stands in front of me I still remember
[35:52] seeing a do it points to the scripture
[35:53] goes and gets a toy mask gives it to him
[35:56] and then and then he just broke down
[35:58] says the Lord spoke to me and four weeks
[36:00] before that he is saying where's this
[36:02] telephone we can talk to God he said God
[36:06] just spoke out of a two-year-old ain't
[36:08] man and told me I need to take off my
[36:10] religious mask and obey the word and he
[36:12] got baptized a my Lord Jesus Christ and
[36:14] he's made a different man ever since
[36:16] Allu yeah now and I'm not saying that
[36:20] because it's my daughter no God can use
[36:22] anyone to the natural it may just seem
[36:25] like a little child that's just busy
[36:27] running around but God said I'm going to
[36:29] anoint that one to do that
[36:31] hallelujah yeah I hope you don't mind if
[36:35] I say brother Kayla but we're now at
[36:36] first in our house he had this big mind
[36:38] battle if he's going to make it to the
[36:39] rapture or not big all the devil had him
[36:41] in a corner lilius ones room wanders
[36:44] into the room and says and you glad
[36:46] Caleb we're going in the rapture she
[36:49] said that a and it just broke hallelujah
[36:55] our God is alive now she doesn't
[36:59] normally talk that way if you're
[37:00] wondering she doesn't rapture it's not
[37:02] her every second word but you're an
[37:06] important part of the body you're
[37:08] important you have great value you're
[37:11] worth more than ten thousand worlds holy
[37:14] and you wake up and you just think
[37:15] you're just little old you and God's
[37:17] looking at you and you're and you're in
[37:19] God's mind and you're important to him
[37:20] and God wants to use you like never
[37:22] before
[37:23] you know we're called to be living
[37:24] epistles written on of all men this
[37:26] message must put on flesh hallelujah and
[37:29] it is putting on flesh more than books
[37:31] more than quotes more than scriptures on
[37:33] the wall but a Living Word of Living God
[37:35] I mean God putting on flesh and his
[37:37] bride Holly that's how important you are
[37:40] amen so so he was commanded to run and
[37:43] stand between the living and the dead
[37:45] and your praise can change someone's
[37:49] life
[37:51] hallelujah singing a song you saying
[37:53] something could change someone's life
[37:56] now Jesus would tell a parable and and
[38:00] and I always love this scripture we'll
[38:02] just finish on the scripture but there's
[38:05] a time when Jesus was sitting in a house
[38:07] and he was he was speaking he was
[38:09] preaching in this house and there were
[38:10] there was a man who was on a cot and he
[38:13] couldn't walk he you know he was sick
[38:15] but his friends his friends had a burden
[38:18] we must get him into the presence of
[38:20] Jesus of Nazareth
[38:21] and they couldn't get through the door
[38:23] they couldn't get through the window no
[38:25] no this is more than a story this is
[38:27] more than a story what I was right
[38:29] this is this is faith in action and so
[38:31] so they couldn't get remember they had a
[38:34] revelation this is the Christ we just
[38:36] need to get him into his presence get
[38:37] him into the presence of the word amen
[38:39] and then all of our friends problems
[38:41] will be taken away and so they couldn't
[38:44] get him in the door they couldn't get
[38:46] him in the window they couldn't carry
[38:48] him and so something moved on them we're
[38:50] gonna take this place apart
[38:51] waking up we're gonna make a Sun roof
[38:54] they carried him up on the roof they
[38:56] begin to take the tiles away
[38:58] Jesus is down there they saw maybe maybe
[39:01] they lifted the first tile he's there
[39:04] undo those ones and maybe the man's on
[39:07] the cautious laying there thinking well
[39:08] these guys doing what they doing
[39:10] but their faith has moved they had a
[39:13] burden we're not just gonna leave our
[39:15] friend in this condition they're gonna
[39:17] he's gonna get into the prints of the
[39:19] Son of Man he's gonna be changed I mean
[39:21] so so so they finally took the tiling
[39:23] off enough and in the man I just
[39:25] thinking about the men's laying on his
[39:26] back on this on this couch and they said
[39:29] all this cot and they tell him stay
[39:31] still
[39:32] they're gonna pick it up tied ropes to
[39:35] every four corner they begin to lower
[39:36] him down and as this man is lying on his
[39:39] back he's just looking into the sunshine
[39:41] seeing his friends lower him down and
[39:44] then he comes finally I don't know if
[39:46] everyone got a bit quiet when they saw
[39:48] this man being lorded you know but
[39:51] finally this man was laying on this
[39:53] couch and he looked into the eyes of a
[39:55] man and it was a different kind of look
[39:57] more than a religion more than a church
[40:00] service more than just teaching here was
[40:04] the creator he was the one that could
[40:07] heal all disease and then it's amazing
[40:10] it's seasoned so so I'm in Luke chapter
[40:12] 5 and it says in verse 20 and when he
[40:16] saw their faith he didn't see the man on
[40:20] the catches faith he saw their faith
[40:23] that lured him down into the prints of
[40:26] the Son of Man says when he saw their
[40:29] faith your prayers can remove tiles your
[40:32] prayers can remove hindrance aim in your
[40:34] life you can actually cause walls to be
[40:37] to be evaporated you can cause obstacles
[40:40] and we take you out of the way that
[40:41] people can get into the presence of God
[40:44] that's why I said it's more than a story
[40:46] this is a reality this is you say little
[40:49] old me yes you see how powerful your
[40:52] life is you can literally when you can't
[40:54] get them through even maybe the door of
[40:56] a church or the window I mean to where
[40:58] God is you can get them into his
[41:00] presence I mean wherever you may be you
[41:02] can remove the obstacles many times we
[41:04] think of our prayers knowing and you
[41:06] know your are they even doing any good
[41:07] in heavens moving God has an appointed
[41:10] time I mean the prodigal son had a
[41:12] journey quite a long way he had to spend
[41:14] a lot of money he had to get to a
[41:15] certain condition but when he got to the
[41:17] Pigpen brother Ram says the angel Lord
[41:19] came came to that Pigpen where he was
[41:22] hallelujah then he came to himself I
[41:25] meant sometimes we think is God really
[41:27] hearing my prayers he's right on time
[41:29] you ought to keep in confidence the
[41:31] Lord's heard the prayer the cry of my
[41:33] people I'm in head and and he will
[41:36] answer see here he was he looked into
[41:40] the eyes of a man it was different look
[41:44] this man see because when he saw their
[41:47] faith he said unto Him man my sins are
[41:50] forgiven me he was a man who was
[41:53] crippled maybe here's thinking this man
[41:55] could heal him but we know our Lord goes
[41:58] deeper than just natural healing it says
[42:00] thy sins are forgiven thee and the
[42:03] scribes and the Pharisees begin to
[42:05] Reason saying who is this which speakers
[42:06] blasphemies who can forgive sins but God
[42:09] alone oh my
[42:11] but when Jesus perceived their thoughts
[42:13] he answering said unto them why reason
[42:15] ye in your hearts whither is easy to say
[42:18] thy sins be forgiven there you also rise
[42:20] up and walk
[42:20] that you may know that the Son of man
[42:23] has power upon earth to forgive sins he
[42:26] said unto the sick of palsy I sound to
[42:28] the arise take up that couch and go to
[42:31] thine house and a measely immediately he
[42:33] rose up before them took up that wrong
[42:35] he lay and departed to his own house
[42:37] glorifying God hallelujah to me that's
[42:40] more than a story your faith your faith
[42:44] can lower a person into the prison's of
[42:47] God
[42:48] and their sins can be forgiven your
[42:52] faith so I say we've got a job to do
[42:55] we're here for a purpose
[42:57] you're not here just to fill the seat
[43:00] we're not here just to fill seats and
[43:02] sing and just go through emotion we're
[43:04] here for a purpose you say God manifests
[43:07] your purpose in my life may your work
[43:09] put on flesh move me into what I'm
[43:11] called to be and you but you actually
[43:14] find yourself naturally going into that
[43:16] position how blessed it is help pleasing
[43:22] it is for unity to dwell for the Britain
[43:25] to dwell together in unity it is like
[43:27] the precious ointment upon the head that
[43:29] ran down upon the beard even Aaron's
[43:31] beard and went down to the skirts of his
[43:33] garments that's how precious unity is we
[43:38] can fulfill our role upon the earth
[43:40] listen we can go to places with God that
[43:43] I just say it this way the bride can go
[43:45] to places with God that other people
[43:47] can't because we're his wife I mean
[43:51] we've got a relationship it's very
[43:52] different to the servant hallelujah we
[43:55] can speak to him amen and and we can
[43:57] move his heart I'd say in a greater way
[43:59] than 10 servants can I mean there's
[44:02] nothing like the voice of your spouse
[44:04] Holly it moves your heart like you know
[44:07] knowing others voice to us and it's like
[44:09] when you talk to God something stirs in
[44:11] his heart oh my honey bee is talking to
[44:15] me
[44:16] hallelujah what do you have need of
[44:19] glory had to love affairs or not let's
[44:21] house your feet amen you are important
[44:27] to God your priest can change the world
[44:30] I mean this world is falling apart
[44:33] I say Lord may we come together as one
[44:36] like never before
[44:37] may every part of the body just just
[44:40] function may we just be like one heart
[44:42] one mind one Accord I mean the guy could
[44:45] just come down hallelujah that we can
[44:47] take people and we can we can like those
[44:49] men their faith got that man sins
[44:52] forgiven it wasn't her sin I mean I mean
[44:55] I mean sorry it wasn't his faith it was
[44:57] his friends faith that got his sins
[44:59] forgiven him that's how important prayer
[45:02] is that's amen so I'm gonna leave it
[45:06] there I think we should pray all
[45:09] together amen
[45:11] you say well I've heard this before well
[45:13] you just heard it again we can't get
[45:15] slothful let's press the battle this
[45:18] could be the last year we ever have
[45:19] let's have a different kind of year you
[45:22] know sometimes we have in our mind well
[45:24] the message uses me like this and church
[45:25] will be like this and well I've read
[45:27] that chapter before so it'll just be
[45:28] like this don't let God speak to you
[45:30] every when you open the scripture said
[45:31] well I've written a million times the
[45:33] million million and one could be the
[45:35] difference
[45:35] I meant that could be the one that
[45:38] changes you I've heard that message
[45:39] before but the next time could be the
[45:41] different one where he speaks you like
[45:43] never before
[45:44] I say God come and move on our hearts
[45:46] amen may your work be finished
[45:49] may your divine plan be finished in this
[45:51] earth I mean there's many lost and dying
[45:53] in this world God back we may we felt
[45:56] overflowing your kingdom amen let's
[45:58] let's give the invitation Amen one soul
[46:02] is worth more than ten thousand worlds
[46:03] and that's the one thing I want to see
[46:06] this year soul saved I want to see
[46:10] people transform literally before my
[46:12] eyes
[46:12] I mean that's why I want to see shackles
[46:15] broken their past God I'm in the blood
[46:17] washing them see the power of God in
[46:19] every life that's what I want to see
[46:22] Amen he say can I do the job absolutely
[46:26] now he you read in the book of Zechariah
[46:29] there was Josh
[46:30] the high priests and and and he was
[46:32] closed and filthy rags and Satan was
[46:34] here to withstand him then the angel
[46:36] Lord said Satan I rebuke thee and he had
[46:38] to leave then he commanded that Joshua
[46:40] would his rags will be taken out of the
[46:44] way and a miter will be put upon us hit
[46:45] him and and priests garments put upon
[46:47] him now the devil's there to fight you
[46:50] coming to your position amen but the
[46:53] angel Lord is present amen to rebuke the
[46:55] Devourer amen to rebuke the devil I mean
[46:58] that you can come to your god-given
[46:59] place now remember Joshua will always
