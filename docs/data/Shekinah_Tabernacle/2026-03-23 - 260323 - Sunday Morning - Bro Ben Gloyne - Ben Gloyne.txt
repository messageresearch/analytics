pray Lord you'd come once again Lord Jesus Lord anoint speaker and hearer of god father may just take control Lord we love you we submit Our Lives into your hands we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's just before we take our seats we're going to read a piece of scripture from Mark chapter four and I just want to apologize I don't have photos and videos to to show right now um I'll put some more on the on the WhatsApp but I want to kind of incorporate the trip into this morning's um service because I had a real education I had a real or I had a real education you hear Brother Bram talking about certain things you said in reality it just it is astounding amen so Mark 4 and we're going to read verses 26 down to 29. um so this is the Lord speaking here well all of his Bibles I'm speaking but anyway it's in read and he said so is the kingdom of God so if a man should cast seed into the ground it should sleep and Rise night and day and the seat should spring and grow up and you know if not how for the Earth bringeth forth fruit of herself now notice his four stages of this first the blade then the ear then after the full layer in uh full corn in the air but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put us forth the sickle because the Harvest is come God bless you friends you may have your seats uh this morning it's great to be back amen it's um had a had a wonderful time in Chile the Lord really blessed I believe and um but this is this is the thing that really astounded me is because we we really went the whole idea was burden on brother Pedro's heart he wanted to go home and and share the message with the Pentecostal denomination that he came out of and um and it's amazing because many of them they have long hair they have long you know they have skirts they look like us but there's a totally different it's a totally different world in terms of the liberty of the god and him moving in in there and you know brother Baron speaks about how you know there was the restoration of of the the truth right as as Jesus said you know unless a corn of wheat you know falls into the ground and dies it abides alone he's speaking about himself you know he has to be a death burial resurrection that now would be the life his life would not just be in himself but being as Believers right but then also that same process would happen down through the church where we go on the Dark Ages the church was you know buried in the ground but then we'll come forth on a reformation and a restoration and it's amazing when when you hear Brother Brown talk about it you just take it for granted that you know the grain is here again and you know there's been a restoration and you know there's you know the life has moved on from you know from where from where Luther was or Josh I live by faith the life of God was in that movement right but then the but then you know they denominated they formed a denomination and God had to raise up the wesleyans with the second work of Grace they took they took justification but they believed in sanctification God was restoring back to the original faith and you know but then they formed a denomination you know then they put a full stop behind what they believe in God had to move on and um and then there was the Azusa Street movement the restoration of the gifts and in in Chile there was a big powerful movement in the Pentecostal Church you know they but there it's interesting uh Jimmy could probably described better than me but you know it's not like here where you say these people are methodists they look a certain way and these people are Catholic they look a certain way and these people are you know what a Baptist but they're they all look the same that can look like us but they can be Catholic or they can be methodists and then the gifts and different things can be in the Methodist Church you know there's all these it's like a big mouthing pot of of things but there used to be a powerful outpouring of the Holy Ghost there in that country and people would shout and scream and speak in tongues and God would generally move but now it's because the life has moved on it's just a tradition you know I don't know if brother Isaac's watching this but you know Chile is the land of guitars this mandolins all kind of get there's like a whole whole band of people playing it doesn't matter what church you're in you know yeah I mean uh you know denominational church but they all look the same but there's not a liberty for God to move anymore see God will give you God will take as much as you give him you know he always comes where he's invited just like with um you know Jesus when Simon the Pharisee invited him to the feast right invited him to the feast Jesus knew he'd be there with unwashed feet made unwelcome sitting in the corner but he took that corner right so so in the Pentecostal churches they believe people are instruments they believe in the gifts that's their major thing and um and people seem to be gifted but that's all where God can move God doesn't move anywhere else it's just a total it's very it's very like okay now we're going to stand and we're going to pray for this now the young people are going to pray for them and now this person is going to pray for the country and they all will just repeat Glory adios three times through the service but it's all like it's all a traditional formal worship it used to be years ago people start crying out glory to God and the spirit of God will fall upon them they'd be slain in the spirit they'd be changed but now it's just been it's become a family tradition and you know but sincere people lovely people we had wonderful time with them humble sincere but God has moved on and then when we came to the came to the message churches it just felt like home there was a liberty because remember God will God will take what you give him so if you give him just a little bit of your life he'll take that but you've got to open every door of your heart he can't just be your savior he's got to be your Lord you've got to allow him into your private life brother bam says there's doors within the door in your heart so your pride you've got to let them into that door your private life God let him into that door your faith got to live into that door well what do you mean the door of faith will people say well I don't believe that anymore well that door's closed to God then pride is don't tell me how to change my life well there's a door of Pride don't you know who I am see and you know different things see private life well I can be whatever I want no we're Christians 24 7. Amen to these different doors and and he'll he'll let you in I mean he'll take as much as he can get amen so so it's very um I found it very interesting that way but very very traditional but very formal way of worship didn't used to be that way and um yes I got a very big education because it's more than just because some people think well if you've got you've got uncut hair and you've got a skirt then you must be a believer and God will move in power no that's just a small part of it that's not the life of the word because they all a lot of them had that a lot of them appreciate it because I shared Christine's testimony of the power of uncut here you know to everyone everyone knows those testimonies I'm sure maybe I'll share it anyway we're here you know why not but because even even sharing those things because pastors message pastors were watching the services when we're preaching the message churches then they finally understood the whole reason for it you know because we know remember everything we do is affected by the Unseen World and we affect the Unseen World just like when you get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you're telling this world also Heaven and Hell whose side you're on right you are telling the Unseen World because remember because remember it's just like if I had a natural thing where where where we can see you're the wavelength of light we can see a small portion of it most of it's unseen right so it's like the world that we live in most of it is far greater in the Unseen World than in this world that we think we know everything about amen so I tell them how you know when she was in her late teenage years and there was people in the church she was in sisters were tempted to trim her hair and you know if it says it says in First Corinthians 11 that you know that word long means to let grow to be uncut to have long hair right and then she had a dream where she had scissors in her hand and she'd probably tell us far better than me but you know where where she was about to cut her hair there were Angels around her pleading with her saying don't cut your hair because we cannot protect you if you do and then one of the angels went to First Corinthians 11 and we'll let's just find that and then you know and and read this one scripture to her but it all ties together First Corinthians 11 and verse 10. I just felt because over there they believe in these things the Pentecostals the the younger generation not so much but the older generation yes it says for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angel so for this course what's this cause that she has uncut here which is long hair right it's not a length it's being uncut then she has power in her head so she's got protection Angelic protection on her because and the angels are that protection so so if you obey this word in faith because you're a Christian then you have the best security detail in the universe President Biden's got nothing on what's around you 24 7. amen so then I you know so I shared those things and then they begin to see actually there's a reason for it it's not just where you've got to follow this thing no there's there's a spiritual application Amen to the other God you know and then and then so she had that dream she didn't cut her hair right and then she had the dream where she was working her father's knife shop and I would we need to go there and take photos of the layout because I couldn't emphasize strong enough where she's standing in that shop it's impossible for her to escape anyone right if a man came in crazy with a knife saying I'm gonna kill you but because she had Angelic protection the the man could not kill her and then two weeks about after that there's a quiet afternoon this you know in the shop it was a public holiday no one was around and a man who looked exactly like the one in Her Dream came in with a knife crazy sack I'm gonna kill you swearing at her and so on but then she felt the anointing of God come down and the man froze and he ran out and then even came out came back and later said sorry about that lady then ran out again something like that AC but why because her hair was uncut she had a revelation because it's uncut she got Angela protection and then a couple of years after that you know she's walking down the park there in a secluded area of the park there's a man with a dog you know and they're in the past she decides to walk past him anyway and as soon as she gets to where he is there's three other men jump out the bushes and Surround her now I believe she would have ended up dead and she thought I'm in a bad position but then she then the Revelation came to her again her hair is uncut they can't touch her and the prince of God came down they all froze and she pushed the dog out of the way and kept walking on amen see see these things work if you if you believe the word in faith then God will vindicate the word in your life amen but even even pastors there didn't even understand these things when they heard that like Ah that's why see it's more than just a do and I don't it's that's got nothing to do with it amen so that was very powerful and I shared a few other testimonials and things around but that one I think really spoke to a lot of people amen but it's amazing when you see and you know and we were in one one um one church so I'm just gonna that this may be a bit of scramble leagues today but you know but but so so we spoke at five Pentecostal churches and then two message no three message or something like that anyway and so so so what happens there is they have a hierarchy in the Pentecostal Church where there's a pastor and he's got like six other churches underneath him and he just goes around there every soft and any any preachers but there's other men there that aren't well they just fill in for him when he's not there and so we went to one and um and and and then also so I should say we had what we call the paparazzi come around with us which is a husband and a wife and then another Young Brother they came to all of the services to support us and they made a world of difference see because you think look because all we did was basically just go through the scripture you know it's just like a Bible study just taking things like anointed ones at the end time you know you know the devil Howie made the angels fall and that battle came on us the battle of the mind all these things but they they were amening and they made a world of difference so she's never underestimate when you say amen and Faith to the word yo it can change your service it can change your service from just a mediocre one to God moving in power when you say Amen in faith amen sir so we call them the paparazzi and um and um so so they came to one service and um now because so the Pentecostal churches they are led by gifts they call the people instruments they you know and they have dreams and they prophesy and all different things and I don't know if it's true or not maybe some things are but it's all very much that way the word is put to one side see Jesus is in the corner with unwashed feet he's not he's not made welcome anymore because they've taken credential traditions and and they've emphasized those things above him so he's in the corner with unwashed feet and then so we went to this one service and we're there in the song service now I can't understand half of what's being sung but I was just there and I was going to preach on anointed ones at the end time and but that was just in my head it wasn't in my heart but I just fell in my head this is what and I was kind of wrestling is this the right thing to preach and I just saw the people I thought these people are genuine sincere they do love the Lord but they are bound in denominational slavery and I thought these people deserve to be free and um and then and then I begin to think about Samson being blinded there going into the Temple of Dagon to push down the pillars you know where because that's what brother bam said is the Pentecostal Church became has become that enslaved they dance with the world they've been enslaved by the world and the devil's put out their spiritual eyes and if we're not careful that can happen to us too we know what I mean from those things right I mean so so I was standing there saying these people deserve to be free Yo think in my mind then we had a time of prayer and I just began to pray Lord just once more and now now I'm wrestling in my mind but I'm preaching an anointed ones right I shouldn't be you know this and then and then and then I um and then Pedro's next to me says you know the world that the church is Dancing with the world just like Delilah was Samson was dancing with Delilah I thought well I'm just going to preach that and so I preached I I took their own history to prove to them where they had fallen from you know because because he you know you know Pedro explained the history of the Pentecostal church God moved in power it wasn't now let's all stand up and say Glory adios three times and sit back down God moved and power people's lives fear would transformed but now it's become a family tradition I use that just like brother I did with the Pentecostal church just to explain to them look you're once this but what's happened to you I said I'm not being here to be critical I say this out of love but what's happened you were once this and then there are some old people in the church they're agreeing with me they were nodding saying yes we were once this but what but what has happened for you to become this way and um and so and so after the service so I just thought well we're probably not going to be invited back again but the pastor was there and he said thank you we appreciated that and and there was one of their instruments got up and energy and and she said she doesn't normally um get up and say things at the end of a service but she had a dream a couple of weeks ago and uh in that dream Pedro and I were in that dream and we're in a church in a house and then and then and then also um so I don't have all the details exactly right but then she had in the um she said now during on this service one of the other instruments um took her and took her to the front to pray for her but before that happened the pastor's wife came and took a young baby off her so that could happen and that happened in the song service in this in this dream and then now in this dream they were actually all prisoners in this church and there were men coming from the outside an old-fashioned army uniforms to come and kill them and then she was lifted up above the church and she saw two columns of angels coming down and then she was told read Matthew 24 if I can find it here one scripture Matthew 24 and 31. and then so then she read this and said and it says here and he shall and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his lick from the four wounds from one end of the Earth no I'm not sure if it's that one I might have it wrong but there's a scripture if it's not that one that says he'll send us angels in the end and they'll separate the weed and the tears right I think it's that one actually I think I've got the wrong scrubs just think about it now but that was going on right there right there but then it was interesting because the paparazzi when they're driving to that service they were talking and they said God will take one of their instruments and vindicate to them what was happening right now is the truth because that's the only way they'll listen and that's exactly what happened amen because because they've because they've placed the word to one side and they've taken gifts Above The Giver you know and we've got to be very careful because remember because where he is welcome he'll take all the room right so if you make the word first place in your life he will do whatever he wants and it's more than just prophecies and tongues interpretation and gifts and miracles and dreams whatever more but heat comes and lives in a very powerful way amen I believe it amen so so because remember also in this in this age where where brother Brown would say about you know taking the ladies in church age we know we live in that condition right this world is Rich and keep increased with Goods have need of nothing but don't you know you're a miserable wretched naked poor and blind and don't know it he says I stand at the door and knock if anyone hear my voice open up the door I'll come in and sup with him and he with me and what is that that is Jesus on the outside of the church world trying to get back in see it's the first time in history in the Gentile dispensation where he's actually on the outside of his religious systems we can't get back in because they've accepted creatures and traditions above the word of God and it was the same thing when we were when we were there it just felt like we were on the outside there wasn't like a welcoming spirit wonderful people had Great Fellowship had lots of last shared testimonies all different things with them outside but when we came into the church it was like we're trying to like we're trying to speak through a window like you're on the outside of someone's house trying to get their attention why because Jesus is on the outside of the church system amen but then when we went into the message churches like well the door was open he's already there why because he the word was had had preeminence amen so I was it maybe I'm not showing you I mean giving you the right but I trust you can see the difference between see we take for granted where we are we take for granted what we have that we're not living in you know living on the memory of a past move of God right because that's what they have sadly because God has moved on and I was saying to them you know saying to people you know if if if there's no denominations the Catholic Church would be in the message Church because I would have moved on that would have seen the era of their ways and they would have all just thrown out the Hail Marys and the sprinkling of babies and all the stuff that's contrary to God's word and they would have walked on but because of the spirit of denomination religious spirits and we said it's not we're not against the people we're not even against the church we're against the religious spirit in there that holds the people back so that's why brother said he so he said I feel so misunderstood because people think I'm just against their denomination I'm not against the the people I'm not against the churches I'm against the system that holds the people back amen it's exactly the same thing today the good sincere people but then they but then they that that spirit in there holds them back from who they should be in the in the Lord amen and then so we drove four hours to a place called Constitution and um there's a church there and and that's where I sent the um sent the videos and saying you know they've made Jesus town already who said you know I put that on the brothers and sisters now how that actually happened it wasn't actually a purpose-built village it's called worship Village so it's not it's not okay we're building a church commune everyone's gonna live here that's not how it worked the pastor felt to buy four acres of land now there's no minimum subdivision kind of thing like here and and and he he lived there and he and his wife lived on this basically this rock of a hill and they and for six years they had no power or water she had to go down and get the water from the stream and all different kind of things but then other people started to move there and so what happened is he would I don't know if he I come here if he gave it or just sold portions of land to people so it's now basically a subdivision where everyone owns their own property builds what they want and so on and then eventually they decided let's move the church here too so that's just how it evolved it wasn't like a we're building a commune right does everyone understand that yeah there's quite a difference between a commune and a let's build a subdivision happen to have a church there 95 of the people are believers so it's like Camp all the time it's quite it's quite neat but you know people you know will go to school different places they have jobs you know whatever more and but it's amazing because there it's a very small town the Constitution is not a big place you know in San Diego um San Diego what is it Santiago muchas gracias Santiago that's the capital rights you expect big churches there but in Constitution very small kind of small uh um coastal town but but it's one of the biggest churches in the country second biggest is in that place now how that church started is is the is the brother there uh Pastor Elias he was having a so he started you know felt there to start having meetings and he's having a street meeting and and on that day about 10 hours before that someone got murdered multiple stab wounds was dead in the morgue and um and his family so so the Dead Man's family was actually in in the street meeting admits some of them were drunks and all kinds of things and but he was preaching and then he felt a voice and he thought it was behind him said if if I raise him from the dead will you follow me and then and then he heard that voice and then everyone just got on their faces started crying out to God and he didn't realize he thought it was the Lord speaking there behind us actually came out of his lips and then and then while he's preaching about those things the man was actually on the autopsy table he is about to be sliced open to have an autopsy and he came back to life and he and he ran out of the morgue and so now while we were there he was sharing testimonies because because so now his family is mainly Pentecostal so the ones who are not Believers but if they have a hard case of a disease or a sickness they bring them to him now if God is all powerful in their Church while they're coming to a message believer right so now so now when we're there he was just sharing so this is just in the song service now you couldn't hear it because it's in Spanish but he said you know they thank the Lord there was a there was a there was a there was a mother having a baby and the baby was deformed in the womb so they prayed and the baby was born healthy strong and well there was a praise report of her sister who had cancer now she doesn't have cancer and he said there's been multiple times leukemia all kinds of sickness as God is just supernaturally healed and people bring their sick to him and God God heals them I'll go see see I think we take for granted where we live you know you know you know where we live we think well we're in the message we just have church no this is where God's life is this is where the life of God the final manifestation of the restoration of of of God's word is actually here right now right says the grain has come back again amen the fruit is here now the Harvest is going on it's not the shook anymore see the Pentecostal church was the shook that protected the grain who knows about wheat anyone here you know so so first there's a shook grows and it looks like the the wheat but the wheat is growing on the inside then as the wheat gets a certain size begins to push the shook away then it can be in the presence of the Sun and ripen to become exactly like it was when it was planted and that's where we are it was a good shook God lived in the shop just like God lived in Luther's time and then Wesley's time but the life came up the plant right then it came into the head and everything became golden then the shook pulled away and then the grain became golden right and that's where we're living Hallelujah and now you've got to realize friends that if we're back at grain again well who is the grain the real believer is the grain right so we're made of the same material of faith that was planted right so we're made of the same material as our Lord Jesus Christ the only difference is he was born sinless and we were born in sin shaped and liquor he didn't know who we were right but in our souls we're built of the same material that that that he's made of Amen so I think we should really treasure and rejoice what we have don't just take for granted that almighty God has come down revealed his word he's not on the outside of the church trying to get back in right he's been welcomed amen he's not sitting in the corner with unwashed feet saying well I'll take you as my savior I'll take you as maybe a philosopher or someone's good ideas but I've taken you as my Lord and Savior You're My All In All amen and we've washed his feet we've made him welcome now he's the head of the feast amen amen I trust I I trust that's that's what's happened in your own life not just collectively but individually Alleluia so they had they had many um yeah so they have many testimonies of God moving in power and it was amazing man it was such an electric atmosphere in that place where it's such a blessed time with them and um yeah it was a real it was a real blessing amen and then we um and then we went back to Los Angeles again preaching some more uh Pentecostal churches and so on the Mrs Church at the end and and it was just a real blessing like this you know people came to me they said you know you've just preached my life you know questions I've had for years things I've been struggling with you've answered them they're gone you know we'd have with our fellowship with people and it was like man you just start talking and then you know things with examples will come you think where'd that come from you know you know it's just like like we're talking to um uh Jimmy's parents and they want to know about you know doing you know do we worship brother Baron these things because there's all these there's these scarecrows around see I said no there's no no we don't worship him I said it's like and this never came to me and to me I mean I was blessed by it that you know it's like it's like the eunuch there you know in the book of Acts he's going in his Chariot right and he's reading Isaiah he has no idea what it means he's reading the Prophecies of the Messiah and then and then the Lord directs Philip who knows the interpretation of that scripture to join himself to The Chariot and then now Philip says do you understand what you're reading he says I don't know unless someone teach me and then he takes that scripture and preaches Jesus Christ so now when that unit goes down into Ethiopia what would he do he'd take that he would take that prophecy he'd say Philip told me this is what it means and I Know It means that because God Vindicated in my life it's the same thing with brother Baron people say well you you know you worship no he's like Philip he shows us what this means right and God vindicates us to be true Hallelujah so so I found that you know you know things like that would happen you know people would you know but but yeah so so it really helped I mean it was a blessing all all around and it was amazing the last service that I preached in the Pentecostal churches where so so I felt to take anointed ones at the end time showing you know you can't just go by an anointing you can't go by enthusiasm you can't go by people prophesying all kinds of things because you've got to take it all back to the word the word must be number one amen you know taking like Makaya there with the 400 profits and these 400 prophets of Ahab and their Prophet saying go up and take ramoth Gilead the Lord's with you I said I said you know even even even the king of the I mean I mean the leader of that organization you know took the horn you know made two horns and got all enthused and this is gonna happen and see because signs should not follow us yeah science no sorry science should not lead us signs should follow us right because if you take the profit you know if you take King Saul and David right David science followed him signs laid Saul because remember Sammy would say to him you know okay now I'm going to anoint you now you're going to go here someone's going to give you some bread and some wine you go here you're going to prophesy with these people and all these things signs led him but but he wasn't actually a man after God's Own Heart but then what happened to David he got anointed just went back to being a Shepherd now whose testimony is better outwardly think man brother Saul wow God's leading him it's amazing but he wasn't a man after God's Own Heart but then science began to follow David and those signs are actually a Vindication of who he was because remember he was anointed he was King over Israel he already was King the anointing just brought it to life so now God would vindicate he had Dominion he had Dominion in whatever Kingdom he was in the first Kingdom he was in he had sheep that was the Sheep Kingdom right lion came in beer came in and and God proved to him you are King in this Dominion because because he killed those Lion in this Bear right they could not take the sheep and then now he comes into he comes into battle there's Goliath right amen David kills Goliath why because because David was the rightful king of Israel and where the Philistines came in was actually a part of Judah which was the inheritance of David amen so so David was actually in his position in Judah enemy came into his position what happened the enemy died David lived and that was a Vindication that was a sign following him that the anointing that came upon him was you're going to be king is everyone following I made this morning I mean so science should follow us to vindicate we are the bride of Christ right God should our testimony should be a Vindication that our Lord is with us and that we're the bride because you see now where we may join us with Jesus Christ right where joint is everything he purchased on Calvary we fell there too because he's given it to us he's made us join us amen so all authority and Power in heaven has been made given unto us amen amen and as now now now you look at the authority he had amen every funeral he went to then it's their funeral remember he was lit amen he says the son could do nothing to the father shows me and what the father does the son does likewise he was led by a vision I remember death had to give way to Jesus Christ Lazarus was in the Tomb four days that that had to give way amen his rotting carcass had to become healthy strong and well he stepped back into that body and he came out of the Tomb why because death praise the Lord Death had to be subject to life I mean death is subject to life not the other way around amen because I'm talking about eternal life now amen and then he had he had dominion over all manner of sickness all manner of disease religious Spirits couldn't conquer him culture couldn't conquer him rejection couldn't conquer misunderstandings couldn't conquer him why because he's the great king of glory amen and then what happens is his own life now comes into you and I and then now God is going to remember because what happened now is they are anointed they're in the upper room right and then science started to follow them amen signs started to follow them they meant to show them that they had passed from Death unto life amen that now Peter wasn't wasn't buckling Under Pressure right of of you know you're questioning you know because remember he's saying that Jesus is being you know you know he's on trial Jesus um Peter's on the outside watching he's trying to see what's going on he's warming himself by the fire and some women come along aren't you one of them you know even your own speech betrays you that you're a Galilee and it only swears and he denies him three times and but then he said to the Lord I'm not I'm not I'll never deny you you know I'm a I'm I'm Simon I've walked on water twice I've done Mighty things you know but the thing is because it was his own but he was sincere he was genuine but because the Lord hadn't stepped into his life there was nothing to to overcome the pressure of the age right so then so then he crumbles under that but then now after Pentecost right he could stand the pressure because remember he wasn't just questioned because remember his question by a woman not even in the court on the outside and he buckled and then after Pentecost that he was questioned by the same Sanhedrin that crucified the Lord Jesus Christ and he didn't buckle he said what should we do should we please man or God what should we do we're going to please God we're Christians here that's what we do amen so he didn't Buckle under a far greater pressure than he did on a far lesser pressure what had happened because that was actually a Vindication that he had passed from Death unto life amen and brother Branham uses uses the example of when he is there and his you know hope has died his first wife has died and his little baby Sharon Rose is is dying of the same disease right and then and then so what happens is of course the Devil comes along because he always comes in moments of weakness right remember if you're tired of you're feeling you know down he comes to you then that's why that's why what you should do is you should turn the sign on your door saying actually business is closed come back when business hours are open don't talk to me now devil you've come at the wrong time and actually I have power to tell you to shut up and go away but anyways comes you in weakness and stress and problems that's when the Devil comes he doesn't come when you're on the Mountaintop rejoicing he always comes in a moment of weakness right amen but you see now here was here was the you know yo so so here was here was Peter right he overcame now Jesus no brother Brown was there and his and his brother I'm sorry his his his baby is dying and he's praying with all his heart Lord please may not take her and he just sees this black sheep come across like he's God's not going to answer the press and the Devil comes along and says I thought he said he was a good God I thought you said he loved you I thought you said he's a Healer you've told many people he's a Healer you know and that he's a god of love and mercy and look what he's doing to you and then brother bear because he's in his last points when the devil came he said I was about to agree with him but then something came up with him he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and what was that and he always came back to that that that that that that quickening power of the Holy Ghost was in him he always came back to that to show him the Darkest Hours god holds on to us not us holding on to God Amen he showed us because that was I've never been in that position that would have been a horrible position to be in but yet brother Brown would take it back to that saying actually no the Lord has done a work in my life he's changed me that when pressure comes on he comes on the scene to to that I can overcome what the devil does see many times we're looking at Big Miracles and things that's a miracle yeah Hallelujah that's a great miracle when the enemy comes along like that and you say and he said I was about to agree with him because everything he said was true then something came up with him he said the Lord gives the Lord takes away amen Hallelujah so now you see signs begin to follow the Believers proving to them that the Dominion that their lord had now is in them over all sickness and diseases right over everything and it should be yes we should look back in our lives and say the things that once bothered us tormented us ruled Our Lives those Spirits they don't rule us anymore amen that we should go from glory and to Glory that it shouldn't be that that it's not our emotions anymore that lead us it's not memories and scars and hurts and pains and trouble and Trauma you know God wants to use those things you know God doesn't waste anything in our lives he wants to use it but you're gonna be willing to give it to him you see it's just like in the Old Testament there were six Cities of Refuge right that uh you know that someone who you know you know they committed manslaughter was a mistake or something they could run in there right they had to get in there before the Avenger of blood got them right like a family member who could who could who could settle the score but once they got in there they could let off the pressure because their case would be heard and they are safe once they got in the doors right but the seventh is always a mystery the seventh just like you know there were you know Jesus at the Feast of you know winning Feast of Cain remember there are six six water pots to be filled but he was the seventh right six Cities of Refuge the seventh is Christ himself amen just like the seventh seal is Christ himself returning to the Earth winding up his plan Amen to the seventh is always a mystery hallelujah amen so now the seventh is Christ now now a lot of those Cities of Refuge they were once they want strongholds of the enemy in the land just like Caleb he took one of them it was a malachite City or whatever it was right they see so so what happens is the devil puts pain in our lives and that can become a stronghold where they're thinking can can so traumatizer and trauma's real right remember we're all human I've got some I've got some people I'm a person too right trauma is a real thing okay so there's no I'm not diminishing anything that's happened to in our lives okay so don't get me wrong but if we allow the devil to Harbor that thing that thing will make us live in a way that normally we would not live that way if it wasn't there right you take a you take a enemy City your enemy soldiers are coming up they're raiding other places they're causing havoc and trouble and all because they're in that city right if you took away the city and you took away them there wouldn't be that trouble right so now what God does is he wants to use those things and turn them into actually a blessing where it's no longer a stronghold that's why the Bible says we've got to cast down strongholds right don't allow strongholds to build in our lives well how do they start building how's the how's the foundation build well you allowed that situation to make you bitter instead of better right it comes with a choice amen so so it starts with that okay and then and then the enemy can get into that wound right and then he began to project himself in our lives to our families and all these things we think man what is going on here it's not the person it's that Spirit has gone into their Spirit doesn't mean we're not Believers either by the way right because remember the enemy has a right to inflict us with sickness he has a right to to to to get into our spirits but he can't get into our souls a means if God has stepped down into your soul amen you've been turned from unbelief into Faith what's happened God has stepped in amen so now what happens is now is is the nature of your soul has changed right and then now so now that changes the nature of your spirit amen but then what happens is the enemy can get into your spirit and start causing trouble but it depends who you surrender to see but then now we often wonder why on Earth did that happen to me well God wants to use it you know God wants to use it as a powerful testimony amen because now Caleb comes in it was an enemy City now it becomes a City of Refuge in the promised land amen where God can you know man can run into that testimony and be safe they can be healed they can be redeemed it's the same thing with you and I it's just like brother brownie said you know when his baby was dying Sharon Rose her eyes would cross over in pain and then he said every cross-eyed child that came across the platform what came to his mind his own his own daughter so he could now enter into prayer for that child because he had walked that way before I mean to God use it as an immense he said every cross-eyed child never left cross-eyed and but but but they never knew the pain and anguish that God allowed him to go through to get to that spot that he could enter into their prayers and God could deliver them but what happened it could have been a Philistine Garrison it could have been it could have been just a wound it could have been a stronghold of the enemy in brother Brown's life but he gave it to God and it became actually a City of Refuge we could enter into someone's burden pray for them I mean we could all pray for a cross-eyed child but but it's far different if you've been there before so you can actually step into that burden far more because many times we just sympathize right but if but but but if you've been in that before then you can really relate and you can really pray like no one else can and that's why we have every different testimony under the sun right here right Hallelujah someone walks in these doors they think no one will understand me here just hold on just come for lunch a few times you know let's have some fellowship people were going to open up and say this is where I'm from this is what happened to me but God brought me out and then they can bring it to realize I'm not a special case Hallelujah actually God has delivered them and if he's delivered them he can deliver me Hallelujah so what is that now so that's a sign following amen that's powerful if God has brought you somewhere from somewhere into into this present truth transformed your life you're a living miracle and that's why I said to the people over there I said you know we rejoice in cancers and things being healed but actually the greatest Miracle you ever see is a soul converted that was once dead and trespasses and sins given their life to the Lord being transformed by us Holy Ghost that's a miracle so when you get up in the morning you brush your teeth you live you're actually looking at a living miracle Hallelujah wait you are the miracle amen you are a living Miracle every day you live in this earth you're a living Miracle amen because you know sadly sadly this world is falling apart right Chile is falling apart they have the same problem sure it's not first world like here but you know you know there's economic pressures prices have gone up the value of the currency has gone down wages haven't gone up to reflect those things they have all the troubles we have and I said to them it was funny Pastor Elias you know he's saying everyone should move to New Zealand in the service and then I said in the service you know New Zealand's falling apart too and I listed all the trouble you know one of the highest suicide rates in the world all mental health has gone skyrocketing prices have gone up wages haven't gone up things are families have fallen apart all these things and they said to me after the survey said you know you're kind of wise I tried to get everyone to move to New Zealand and then you said it's not that great so they're going to stay here he said he actually said I tried to get rid of them man that's hilarious man but you know the world is falling apart but why are we not falling apart why our family staying actually getting stronger why is the love between husband and wives and between children why is the family unit getting stronger it's not it's not mental ability it's not because you're in a self-help book or you went on a YouTube clipping you know it's not well I'm deciding our family's going to be better no it's actually because we are beneficiaries we are beneficiaries of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and that and we know really that is the message of the hour right so when you receive this word see he's not on the outside trying to get into your life but you actually open the door because remember that that scripture there in Revelation is not just the church level it can also be in the individuals too because it says if any man hear my voice see and we've heard his voice in this day you open up your heart he comes in you have communion now hallelujah what happened because now you become a beneficiary amen of the open Word of God in this day and then so now our lives don't fall apart like the world sure we may have times have have times of great distress and trouble we're not immune to those things right but God will see you through those things see we have we have a way of Escape you know you know the Bible says you know if there's any trial or Temptation you look for the way of escape and he is the way of Escape amen and he wants to show us right he wants to show us something in the trial see aren't you so glad I'm so thankful you know we're not just but you know you know it's all the grace of the Lord right we understand we're only in this message by Grace right we could be in some charismatic Pentecostal church somewhere amen being sincere with all our hearts you know and and sure God will bless you a little bit in there but you know but he's brought us into present truth he's brought us into present truth you know I'm so thankful that we're not looking backwards but we're looking forward you know where where we see you know you know it's like sadly many have made Christianity a family tradition you know we don't want him to become a family tradition you know I wish I could take you to Chile and show you the contrast and then even even um Jimmy's parents saw the contrast you know and then one of the biggest things that spoke to to his mum was the young people worshiping she said that showed me there's such a liberty in here because in the Pentecostal Church you just kind of stand there there's no yo some don't even believe in clapping of hands or anything you know it's very very rigid like a Catholic Church in a way you know we're going to do this now stand up and pray this everyone stand up and say Gloria adios and now we're going to pray for this and do yes like a system of religion there's no Liberty where you know God can move and so I wish I could take you there and show you that then take you to among the message people and say man this is a day and night contrast we're actually among you know because because even his mom said where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty right amen and I'm so thankful it's not because of us or anything we've done is because no what happened because because you know brother Brahm says if you want to see deity in your midst if you want to see God himself in your midst welcome and receive the word amen if you want to see him he says I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed by a deity which is in our midst are we sufficiently have we been sufficiently impacted Amen to think God has stepped out of History he was once bound at the doors of denominations by Creeds and dogmas but now the end time message because we've been restored back to the truth has has loosed the Holy Ghost I mean I'll share the testimony there you know housing last time I was in New Guinea and you know you know you know Papua New Guinea there's over 800 languages and I was at a convention there's about people from 40 different places you know so at least 40 languages were sitting in that church and and I said this message restores us back to a true Pentecost of Acts chapter 2. and when I was preaching on those things The Interpreter stopped interpreting because everyone understood in their own language I had no idea what was going on I was just preaching away I thought he was interpreting I was just there but after the service people you know pastors who are like because they're you know you know some of them are very stoic they're like you know this one brother he's from he's from the base of the tallest mountain in Papua New Guinea where it where it snows up there Mount Wilhelm you know you know he says you know with our young people we take up the mountain we train them we train them I don't know what that training entails but oh boy but anyway after that service he came to close in prayer and he was just weeping over the pulpit never seen him do that before in my life but he was so moved and then they told me what was you know what happened I say it does because in Acts chapter 2 the day of Pentecost everyone understood in their own language see so we don't have just we're not following a religion we're following the resurrected Jesus Christ amen that is here to change us into the image of his word amen that we can become true Bible Christians amen I'm so thankful that you know that God is so mindful of us you know that it's not us you know it's not us trying to be anything it's what the Lord has already said you know because the reason the reason he's brought us into the truth is because we are green right we are grain yes we are the fruit amen and it's not because of the color of this or the age of this or how smart or the top two inches in my case is definitely lesson two here you know it's not about no it's a seed that God planted by foreknowledge right he looked through time he saw you he says I'm going to predestinate that person and spy for knowledge and it doesn't matter what we came out of hey man it's it it's the seat on the inside you know saying to the people there you know it's like you know you know our our past can be so real and you know Abram had Ishmael we know that hey and so so Abraham but but then he became Abraham and we know the reason that you know a name represents a life right it's when God changes the name he showing a change in life and so Abraham and Sarah Sarah was changed to Abraham and Sarah and in the Hebrew that H represents the Breath of God so when he changed the names from Abraham to Abraham there's an H winning there from Sarah to Sarah and H he's representing now the Breath of God Has Come unto these people and changed their lives now when Jesus was there there before Pentecost before he before he ascended he breathed on his disciples saying receive ye the Holy Ghost and they did in the upper room so there was actually so the Holy Ghost really is the Breath of God comes unto you now the life of God and changes our nature changes our lives and then so now now Abraham has Isaac but then God says to Abraham take your son your only son and take him you know but you think now hold on God made a mistake this Bible's wrong because there's Ishmael Ishmael probably even looks like Abraham he would he'd probably talk a bit like him have the same mannerisms well as Abraham right but he was Abraham's son he wasn't Abraham's son so when God spoke to Abraham and said take your son your only son he was exactly right because that man Abram was dead he may have been living in the same house Abraham and Abraham looked the same but one had died and now a new man had come forth because remember we are not a patched up people we're not a reformed people hallelujah we are transformed we are new creatures in Christ Hallelujah like it says in Revelations it says about our age he says he's the beginning the author of the creation of God right wait let's just let's just read that shall we hey man it's so good to be home Hallelujah but you know it's like we get used to the atmosphere we live in you know if we went up Mount Everest too quickly we would die because not used to the atmosphere because there's a way thinner yo there's way less oxygen up there same same same Earth but different oxygen because it's lower precious less but if you slowly went up the mountain you'd slowly acclimatize as you went up right it's the same thing with you and I we may have been raised in church but there comes a time when God comes and speaks to our hearts and what happens is we begin to live in a different atmosphere of the Holy Ghost actually the word becomes alive you see people scream and shout you under what's going on with those people but then you have the same experience you know you realize that God's grace is amazing amen because it falls on you and then so now you step into a whole different atmosphere then because you because we once we're all dead and trespasses and sins right doesn't matter how much we were we may have been had our first nappy here in this church you know but we all need to meet him right so so it doesn't matter oh I'm in the message that doesn't really mean anything it's like saying I live in New Zealand what does that mean you know it doesn't make you anything you know but you have a we have to have a personal encounter with the Lord ourselves right then what happens is it once and didn't trespasses and sins we once were actually ruled by the prince of the power of the year the Bible says right but then when we give our lives to the Lord because he pulls on our hearts what happens is he breaks that yoke of the enemy and then now we walk in units of life with the Lord right when he fills us with us holy ghost who's who's following me amen and then now we realize the air is way better up here you know this is way different to living down in the dumps of sin I'm I'm living where the air is air is um you know pure you can see for eternity to Eternity before I can just see small doing rubbish burning and all those things but see and you're actually in shock you've been you're here now you're here well that that was my experience man I can't believe I was that and you think man how did I even think how did I even used to be who was that person I don't want to find out I'm just I'm glad I'm not that guy anymore but then what happens is we get used to where we live and we take for granted what we have because you come acclimatized we shouldn't become just acclimatized we should treasure what we are not and what we are what we are not we're not sinners right brother Brown says that many times we make a mistake and we think we have to get saved all over again don't do that see you know for some reason we think oh we've got to go back to the start again give our lives a new and start again no no no no don't do that right if the Lord has met you and changed you cannot be unchanged right if he's really done a work in your soul you cannot be unchanged you have your ups and downs sure but you won't be you don't be coming you don't go back and become lost again right so but what do you do just repent and move on with God right make it right if you've got to make it right with someone make it right move on with God don't don't hold on to condemnation right we're not meant to carry those things let go of it Hallelujah amen praise the Lord oh yeah where were we oh yeah Revelations three yep that's where we go amen so just verse um verse 14. have a going for time all right verse 14. it says and unto the angel of the Church of the later sians right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now if we if you actually look into that that beginning is the author of a new creation and that's exactly what we are God has made us a new creation remember we are not a patched up creature he is the author of the new creation of God and that's what he did that's what he's done in our lives see we're not the old creation patched up we're actually totally New Creations I mean that's why we're telling that's why we think different that's why we act different talk different you know because we're different people just like Abraham was once Abraham but then he then God breathed into him and he became a new creation just like Sarah she became a new creation I mean in Genesis 18 when when when God had a visitation with her according to time of life you're going to have the promised son amen so where once she was doubting and being frustrated and all these things at the promise you couldn't do it in her own strength but then when God came down gave her that visitation she then judged him faithful of whom had promised it says in Hebrews 11 amen and when you judge him faithful what's that you're actually because God has done a work in your life I mean you no longer frustrated and and being annoyed at God's promises not seemingly being fulfilled but you judge him faithful that he can do that which he has promised and then what happens we you can just praise him all day even because remember faith faith looks beyond what you see Hallelujah we don't look at what we see right now what we hear with our ears what we feel in our spirits and our emotions we look to the promise of God Amen so we can look beyond what we see it doesn't matter what people say it doesn't matter no we've got to take that person and say no that person is part of the promise I mean you take prodigals whoever it may be they are part of the promise of God I mean our children actually must receive the Holy Ghost Hallelujah because Jesus because Peter said and I can say Jesus said because Peter spoke through Jesus spoke through Peter right he said repent be baptized every one of you amen for a mission of sin in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promises to you and to your children those who are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call right so so really if you've received the Holy Ghost your children have to Hallelujah I mean we can just take it that simple because it's all part of the same promise Hallelujah so you know but if we look at what we see we can be discouraged but don't look at what you see look with eyes of Faith to what you should really be seeing amen which is the promise of God Amen that's why Jesus said only belief only belief so that means don't believe in reason that means that you know that doesn't mean believe and look at the circumstances right because hope brother Bible says is the greatest enemy faith has see Hope and Faith both believe the promise but Faith doesn't look at circumstances hope does right so don't look at the circumstances because that's hope and that can actually he says it's the greatest enemy faith has this hope right many people hope it's going to happen I hope the word is true and hope you know that the promise will be fulfilled don't look at it with hope say Lord change my hope into faith a man that doesn't matter see because hope doesn't look at circumstances hope looks only at no sorry Faith looks only at the word faith does not look at the circumstances I feel like I just made a big mess of that Faith takes the word only hope does as well takes the word but it takes circumstances as well takes what the five senses declare so it's the enemy of Faith right so just only belief amen because all things are possible to them the belief Hallelujah so you know brother Brian said that the Pentecostal move was a great shook it protected the grain real well but it pulled away why did it pull away because the word came and declared himself right Jesus Christ stepped out of history and said here I am I am the resurrection and the life this is what my word really says this is who I really am and they had a choice either hold on to Traditions or walk with God right and it's the same thing with Israel when they came out of Egypt they had to follow the pillar of fire all the way into the promised land amen and that same Pillar of Fire was there with the Apostle Paul Amen in Acts chapter 9 he saw a great Shining Light there on the road to Damascus and that was Jesus returning his Pillar of Fire and he spoke to Paul amen because because Paul said who are you Lord he says I am Jesus whom you persecute who is he persecuting the church well who was in the church Jesus how did he get into the church he came as a pillar of fire into the upper room separate himself into the uh into the 120 right so now the people had to follow the pillar of Fire they couldn't just stay they had to follow the word as he unfolded himself right so through the writings of Paul even Peter said you know the things that brother Paul says are hard to understand and many wrestle with them and the scriptures to their own destruction so even Peter had the Revelation that what Paul was saying was actually scripture right so we don't want to wrestle with the word will say Lord I don't hey I don't understand this whole thing right this is an eternal book amen If we're honest we say Lord you know it's like when I was studying science at University one of the lecturers said you know the more you think you know it's actually you realize the more you don't know because it actually unlocks so many things you know oh yeah I've got this all down packed and then you learn something more it just like opens a big vast areas like man I have no idea really what's going on it's the same thing with God right yeah amen he opens his word and you think man praise the Lord I know that much but it just opens up a whole thing like when the seals come open Amen to you and you realize actually it's not four horse riders only in Tribulation and the Jews and all those things it's actually the lamb coming forth to redeem you amen it changes your whole man the whole world just I mean the whole Bible just opens up Hallelujah amens let's just keep walking with God but we have to keep following the pillar of Fire right the the lutherans see see Martin Luther I'll say this in a you know as an example he was in the Catholic church but he saw the pillar of fire move the Josh shall live by faith he followed it that far but then the Lutheran stopped and the pillar fire moved on Weasley John Weasley actually he actually heard the commentary of Martin Luther on the book of Romans being read he said he felt a warming in his heart he was a minister he had already gone to America and tried to preach he miserably failed he came back to England then this happened it transformed his life what happened is the messenger of the previous age wrote that commentary and and by reading that by him hearing that amen Faith came transformed his life what happened he saw the pillar of fire move it's not just a Joshua live by faith it's not by Good Works it's by faith alone in Jesus Christ you're Justified but also we live a holy life as well and he followed the pillar of Fire right and then the Pentecostal saw us more than just the Joshua live by faith you know and you know living a holy life but God's power should be back in the church there should be Divine Healing and gifts and all those things they saw the pillar of fire move they followed it but then when Malachi 4 is come and open open the word the full all of Jesus Christ has been restored they had the decision as well are we gonna follow the pillar of Fire or we're gonna stay here right God came now to fully restore his truth hallelujah and here we are the beneficiaries of that amen so let's I'm I might just finish that there it's kind of like a half of a hash of a trip report but what a blessed time and the Lord undertook in not just preaching and things but also um having fellowship with people people said I had questions for years now my questions are answered had no idea what the questions were just explaining things and talking you know having fellowship and you know people said I've been struggling with things for years but now that struggle's over God did God did things like that so it was a real blessed time I thank you so much for your prayers and because remember if one of us goes like that we're all connected with that person going right so it's not just me going but it's actually we are all represented in that same with um Andy and Dave down in Dunedin so thank you for your prayers you know the Lord really was good and I just flew in yesterday but I feel okay so praise God as well thank you for your prayers too amen but aren't aren't you thankful where God moves on we don't just stay in in the shadow but we walk with him something in US is like Joshua right something in Joshua and Caleb because remember the pillar of fire move Moses called Israel out but something in them said it's more than just being here by Sinai and complaining of the desert the pillow fire is going to move and take us into the promised land and they walked with the Lord until they until the lord gave them their inheritance and you're glad God puts up because God put something in them to do it they weren't smarter than the other spies they weren't you know better or whatever something God deposited something in them to say what that man is saying with those Ten Commandments is not him but it's God speaking and now we can take the land because God says it's ours we're just going to go fight for it but God is going to give us a land and they walked with the pillar of fire and possessed their promises and aren't you thankful we're the same amen that it's not just God's end of prophet and you know long hair and dress and baptism and one God and serpent seed but there's more than that but the whole word of God has opened up that now every Divine promise that he has given us we can inherit amen and we just walk as he leads us in his word we walk with him like that it's amazing I wish I could take you to one of those Pentecostal churches find people humble kind generous all those things but yet unfortunately they're living in the past and that Spirit has bound them like that I pray God the God just break the shackles and they'll come into the fullness of the word of God amen because remember we're not against gifts some people think you have one or the other no spirit and Truth we must worship Jesus once filled to worship and spirit and truth so we can't just have the truth without the spirit right and you can't just have the spirit without the truth which is the word we need both running together and I believe by God's Supreme Grace we have that and may we ever stay humble and thankful and appreciative that for whatever you know God's Grace has found us and he'll keep us and let's just keep walking on and love Everyone don't ever look down on anyone say humble love everyone out in the world wherever because remember as God found you right you didn't find yourself and just because you know just because that person hasn't been found it doesn't mean they won't be found amen so let's prayerfully find that last one so we can all go home they might be here somewhere you never know let's just love the Lord and this yeah just continue walking with him can we have the musicians please this morning amen amen I know well I've been here for a couple of Sundays so we can sing it now thank you Jesus for the blood

you know the Brazen serpent the water from the rock that was Israel and they were fulfilling the word going into the promised land amen so people can look the same they can even sing the same dress
