[17:42] I mean when you let a fully trust in the
[17:45] Lord you don't have to worry about
[17:46] anything whatsoever it's very very
[17:50] capable of handling pretty much every
[17:52] situation that we can even be involved
[17:55] in he made the solving and then we can
[17:58] just fully trust in the Lord we save
[18:01] ourselves a lot of problems and a lot of
[18:03] stress a lot of worry because the end of
[18:06] the day our war in space doesn't change
[18:08] anything anyway but you know those the
[18:14] trust in the Lord I've just their lives
[18:15] getting beliefs it seems like then we
[18:19] trust in the Lord the more the Lord can
[18:20] work in your life you'll be like a tree
[18:27] planted by the rivers of water yes and
[18:29] when the drought comes your leaves won't
[18:31] wither and it's such a nice thing too to
[18:37] just watch a believer in every situation
[18:39] trust in the Lord it is to see them
[18:41] prosper we just had a testimony today
[18:43] from one of the Bridgman here maybe I
[18:44] watched here but you know the what she
[18:47] was up against this big supposedly this
[18:49] big metal was Goliath community but
[18:52] that's all just been defeated and we've
[18:56] seen that those of us that have been
[18:57] used for us for a while now we've seen
[18:59] that time and time and time and time
[19:01] again amen
[19:02] with north of Brisbane I remember
[19:04] telling you it's just we were always
[19:06] asking for her Visa Visa Visa and then
[19:08] you know what's gonna happen one day
[19:10] she's gonna get there easily
[19:12] she got her visa residency sorry which
[19:15] that was year was residency and it was
[19:17] we've just watched different ones ever
[19:21] have some sort of struggle or something
[19:22] that they're believing for or something
[19:24] in a divorce
[19:24] they always is it we were just we've
[19:29] just seen it over and over in us it's
[19:31] always exciting but it's never it's
[19:34] never surprising if you know what I mean
[19:36] it's like well we were expecting that
[19:37] like luck with the situation today I was
[19:39] expecting that that this whole situation
[19:42] was going to just go away and sister was
[19:43] gonna be victorious we were expecting
[19:44] there to happen but it's always nice
[19:46] when it does happen you think this lets
[19:48] out a check on Amy they start down a bit

[31:37] your friends you may have your seats I
[31:38] want to take a very simple thought
[31:41] tonight about lifting him up now we had
[31:44] the we had the prayer meeting a couple
[31:46] of weeks ago and you know you know we
[31:48] know that you're the Lord spoke you said
[31:49] you know as as Moses lifted up the brass
[31:52] serpent at the wilderness you know if
[31:53] you lift up if I am lifted up then those
[31:57] who've been bitten by the devil the
[31:58] snake bites they'll be healed I mean our
[32:01] young ones will be healed the other ones
[32:02] women but will be healed so I want to
[32:04] talk about lifting him up you know
[32:06] brother Andy was around at our place
[32:09] last night and he was just preaching my
[32:11] notes completely having fellowship I'm
[32:13] like oh dear I was there on Monday just
[32:15] at work and Lord just opened a wonderful
[32:17] time he just you know and you know he
[32:19] gave us a Monday but then brother Andy
[32:20] was just all over my sermons on idea
[32:22] anyway praise the Lord so you know when
[32:26] God does anything in a generation it it
[32:30] generates it's it's done in order to
[32:33] generate a response from his people you
[32:36] know your when when when Jesus was
[32:38] riding into Jerusalem on you know on the
[32:41] donkey we won't go and read it but you
[32:43] know here was God God he was here
[32:46] fulfilling the prophecy of the Old
[32:48] Testament here was the king coming and
[32:50] desire and here was the king you know
[32:52] the Lord of glory was riding meek and
[32:54] humble on on the back of a donkey back
[32:56] of an ass and here he was fulfilling
[32:58] Scripture
[32:59] and we know the people they got excited
[33:02] they cut down the palm your branches
[33:04] they laid them down you know you know
[33:05] we're here be growing they take off
[33:07] their coats they put them down as heroes
[33:08] yo you know for him to write over them
[33:10] and they cried out Hosanna blessed is he
[33:12] that comes in the name of the you know
[33:14] the name of the Lord and you know the
[33:16] scribes and Pharisees they're all upset
[33:18] yo tell them to be quiet they said to
[33:20] Jesus but Jesus says I tell you that if
[33:23] they should hold their peace stones
[33:25] would immediately cry out they said that
[33:28] there will be a response Amen from
[33:30] something and if they hold their peace
[33:33] the rocks will cry out I because here he
[33:36] fulfilling his word and they're very
[33:38] Mets and they were they were rejoicing
[33:40] they maybe didn't even fully understand
[33:42] what was going on but here they were the
[33:45] lord of glory was riding into Jerusalem
[33:47] to fulfill his word and they there was
[33:50] something and the people just had to cry
[33:51] out Hosanna blessed is he that comes in
[33:54] the name of the Lord
[33:55] they couldn't contain it they couldn't
[33:56] hold it and Jesus said if they hold
[33:59] their peace the stones will cry out now
[34:01] I want to say I don't want to let a
[34:03] stone take my place I don't want to let
[34:05] a bird take my place or the trees or
[34:07] nature nothing's good I don't want
[34:09] nothing to take my place I want to take
[34:12] my place and cried Hosanna blessed be
[34:14] the son of David Hosanna blessed is the
[34:17] Lord Jesus hallelujah I wanna I want to
[34:20] take my place Amy because when God when
[34:24] God sends his word into a generation he
[34:26] does it not just to excite us but he's
[34:29] looking for a response he's looking he
[34:32] does it to generate a worship and a
[34:34] praise and the people I mean you go
[34:36] through Genesis when God met Abraham
[34:38] then Abraham would predict an altar he
[34:41] would he would offer a sacrifice in
[34:43] response to what God had just done to
[34:45] him hallelujah
[34:47] so that's when God opens his word to us
[34:49] what does it do it should generate a
[34:50] praise it should generate a worship that
[34:53] should generate a Thanksgiving
[34:54] hallelujah amen when you come to a place
[34:56] when you realize what God has done it's
[34:59] not just for your parents or your
[35:00] siblings or you or your spouse / it's
[35:02] for you kaalia they should generate a
[35:04] praise and a worship glory Lord you died
[35:07] for me you redeemed me you shed your
[35:09] blood for me Holly you've saved me
[35:11] you've given me hooda life hallelujah
[35:13] and should generate a praise aren't you
[35:15] thankful I've imagined being on death
[35:18] row and you know you're guilty you know
[35:19] you must suffer the death penalty but
[35:22] then someone steps in hallelujah I mean
[35:24] the jailed jail door comes open someone
[35:27] walks and maybe never seen them before
[35:29] but they said no the case has been
[35:31] dismissed color you are free to go
[35:34] hallelujah now do you think do you think
[35:37] honestly do you think honestly if you're
[35:40] on death row and someone comes in with
[35:43] proof that you're free
[35:46] do you think you just stay on your seat
[35:49] and yoyo in your cell and say that's
[35:52] pretty cool
[35:53] no parlor yeah you'll be rejoicing you'd
[35:57] be shouting you'd be having a jubilee
[35:59] all the way out of the prison hallelujah
[36:03] it's a good buy warden goodbye officers
[36:06] goodbye fellow prisoners I'm gone
[36:09] hallelujah hallelujah and then when you
[36:12] get out of the prison you'll keep
[36:13] dancing because you knew where you were
[36:15] but you know you know where you are and
[36:18] you know where you're going and a stop
[36:19] back in the prison cell you're free
[36:21] hallelujah yeah the Lord has done all
[36:25] things for us we just need to accept it
[36:28] rejoice in it and walk in it that's all
[36:31] we need to do oh it's not as generating
[36:34] anything it's him
[36:36] in us that does the work hallelujah
[36:41] so they rejoiced you know so basically
[36:46] I'm talking about how do we lift them up
[36:48] how do you lift them up it's not rules
[36:51] and say thou shalt thou shall not it's a
[36:53] life it's a life expressed it's a life
[36:56] expressed out of you that's how you lift
[36:57] them up you know human nature is
[37:00] actually people don't look up human
[37:03] nature people people normally look down
[37:04] they don't look up hallelujah I mean
[37:08] we're gonna lift them up high lift them
[37:10] up high in our lives he's done so much
[37:13] for us
[37:14] hallelujah he's done all things well
[37:15] he's done incredible things I'm glad I'm
[37:19] saved and I'm still glad I'm saved I'm
[37:22] still glad I'm redeemed Oh Louie it
[37:25] wasn't anything you did did you mirror
[37:26] that no way no way it's not God didn't
[37:30] save us that we would earn it God would
[37:32] save us he died for us that you just
[37:34] receive it and walk in and and rejoice
[37:36] hallelujah but it's up to you will you
[37:38] walk in and say yes or no I'd say yes
[37:41] who wants a stain a dank rank stinky
[37:45] jail cell hallelujah I'd rather walk
[37:49] free on God's green pastures and just
[37:50] rejoice to have a wonderful time
[37:52] amen so that's how we now as I said when
[37:58] when Jesus rode into Jerusalem
[38:00] there was a worship but the people
[38:03] didn't know who is this they see what's
[38:06] this going on that's God fulfilling his
[38:08] word and went from the Prophet to the
[38:10] prophecy now is the prophecy being
[38:13] fulfilled and here we are living in this
[38:15] day hallelujah Malachi fours gone off
[38:19] the scene now it's the son of man and
[38:21] his bride God is fulfilling his word and
[38:24] his bride hallelujah that should
[38:27] generate a praise hallelujah we're a
[38:29] happy people we're rejoicing people I
[38:32] mean with where Jesus is there's a lot
[38:34] of noise hallelujah amen there's a lot

[39:01] about being a gardener and things on
[39:02] Sunday you let him be the gardener you
[39:05] just yield and let him do it it's not
[39:07] now all I've got to rearrange my life
[39:09] though how I rearranged my life I was a
[39:12] drunken University student that was me
[39:13] rearranging my life humanities tried to
[39:16] rearrange his life and look there's
[39:17] going to be a nuclear war and hasn't

[39:38] he never cuts corners he never does a
[39:40] shoddy job he does all things well now

[44:07] and oh you know let's just read from
[44:10] verse 6 I really just want to read verse
[44:13] 14 but I but I like reading Ephesians
[44:16] yeah amen to the praise of the glory of
[44:20] His grace wherein he hath made us
[44:22] accepted in the beloved what's the
[44:24] intent to the praise of the glory of His
[44:26] grace and whom we have redemption
[44:28] through his blood the forgiveness of
[44:29] sins according to the riches of His
[44:31] grace when he had the bounded towards us
[44:34] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[44:36] known unto us the mystery of his will
[44:38] according to the good pleasure which he
[44:40] hath purposed
[44:41] himself that a dispensation of the
[44:43] fullness of times he might gather
[44:44] together in one all things in Christ
[44:46] both which are in heaven and which are
[44:49] on earth even in him and whom also we
[44:51] have obtained an inheritance being
[44:52] predestinated according to the purpose
[44:54] of him who worketh all things after the
[44:57] counsel of his will that we should be to
[44:59] the praise of his glory who first
[45:02] trusted in Christ in whom you also
[45:04] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[45:06] truth the gospel of your salvation and
[45:08] whom also after ye believed you were

[45:13] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[45:15] until the redemption of the purchased
[45:17] possession unto the praise of his glory

[1:08:11] hallelujah amen you know John John in
[1:08:18] the book of Revelation types us brother
[1:08:21] BAM says one man in a vision represents
[1:08:23] a whole body of people you come to the
[1:08:25] end of the Ephesian leader revelations
[1:08:28] for one I saw the voice that spake with
[1:08:31] me I saw him up in heaven the doors over
[1:08:32] to see come up ever that's the
[1:08:34] translation of the saints right one man
[1:08:37] in a vision represents a whole body of
[1:08:39] people and there he is
[1:08:40] lifted up into the eternity and he sees
[1:08:43] he sees the book seals and the right
[1:08:46] and of the original owner and he wept
[1:08:48] much he was he was he was he was crying
[1:08:52] he was said he went much because he knew
[1:08:54] if someone if a man wasn't found worthy
[1:08:56] to take that book then whole of creation
[1:08:59] is in jeopardy because a man as a man
[1:09:02] forfeited the throne in Eden a man had
[1:09:04] to step forth they meant to reclaim what
[1:09:06] what man had in the beginning and no man
[1:09:09] is worthy no prophet was worthy come on
[1:09:12] Paul wasn't worthy brother Brown wasn't
[1:09:14] worthy Moses isn't worthy John nah none
[1:09:17] thermal worthy cuz rock worn and sin
[1:09:20] amen and then I remember here's John he
[1:09:23] lay on the bosom of Jesus he he he ate
[1:09:26] with him he walked with him you know
[1:09:27] there he was he but here so he wept much
[1:09:31] heavier as someone who weeps a lot whit
[1:09:34] much at something their brokenhearted
[1:09:36] thick their crestfallen but then one of
[1:09:39] the other says don't weep John don't
[1:09:42] weep to the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:09:44] has prevailed and when he turned to look
[1:09:47] he didn't see a lion though they are
[1:09:49] both line and he is Jesus lion and lamb
[1:09:52] he turned and saw his lamb here's the
[1:09:55] one that was offered on my behalf he
[1:09:57] steps out of the eternity and then when
[1:10:12] the book came open brother said John
[1:10:15] must have got real happy I mean because
[1:10:17] when the seals came
[1:10:19] consul Jang all in heaven and on earth
[1:10:35] and Maria hello and proud because the
[1:10:45] seal came off the Lord and God said
[1:10:54] [Applause]
[1:11:00] hallelujah and it produced a rejoicing
[1:11:04] and a shouting the book came open and
[1:11:20] the book showed John's inheritance was
[1:11:23] in heaven
[1:11:26] when the word came open he realized if I
[1:11:29] have representation over there if I have
[1:11:32] a theophany body over there then I have
[1:11:34] to step into that
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:41] [Applause]
[1:11:46] and because I had that body I have to
[1:11:49] become sinless upon yeah
[1:11:51] hallelujah yes because no one's gonna
[1:11:53] miss their body in terms of not make it
[1:11:55] toward their body that's what I mean yes
[1:11:57] hallelujah
[1:11:58] you follow me that's we have if you have
[1:12:00] a theophany over there amen
[1:12:02] then you have to be really here to step
[1:12:04] into their body right and then pick up
[1:12:06] your glorified body after that
[1:12:08] hallelujah so John rejoiced that
[1:12:11] produced a worship out of his life he
[1:12:15] had seen Lazarus come out of the grave
[1:12:17] he had seen Jesus hung on Calvary he saw
[1:12:20] the tomb but when he saw that he
[1:12:41] experienced now if John is a symbol of
[1:12:46] the bride color bright I mean that means
[1:12:49] that we must experience and all the
[1:12:54] symbols that looked out they were
[1:12:56] magnification Mystery Babylon we see
[1:12:59] that big benefices you know America's
[1:13:01] coming up we see a benefits of speaking
[1:13:03] as a dragon it's all lived out if that
[1:13:05] Potts lived out what about John having a
[1:13:10] revival because the wood comes or James
[1:13:19] or someone else it wasn't even the
[1:13:21] elders saying look
[1:13:35] John is a symbol of you let's just ask
[1:13:38] the question I I just want to plow with
[1:13:40] this a little bit that powerful I mean
[1:13:52] the machineries being up for that
[1:13:54] death to ride I mean in effects been if
[1:13:59] that's happened what about job rejoicing
[1:14:02] in the would come over what about you
[1:14:05] John looking building to the time saying
[1:14:07] I see myself already
[1:14:09] I shall I see myself there already
[1:14:12] whoo yeah and when the Lord the Son of
[1:14:14] Man comes for you and it was he trying
[1:14:16] to tell you you're with me your are the
[1:14:18] antenna race and then you can't guy you
[1:14:22] top pears you got me like ever get a
[1:14:24] body in the hands already hallelujah
[1:14:27] hallelujah that's a debate and waste the
[1:14:50] tabernacle will be dissolve aces we
[1:14:59] should be such ragged burly Cristiano oh
[1:15:01] right because whatever comes against us
[1:15:03] we should just realize God's allowed it
[1:15:06] just like Jesus hit the pilot Paz I
[1:15:08] don't know how to crucify your Liga
[1:15:10] Jesus teach them and I doubt very much
[1:15:12] anyone here browse it that's the pilot
[1:15:14] who's about to be crucified
[1:15:15] don't you know that the only patty
[1:15:17] happens because it's my father's
[1:15:18] guillotine no one else hit those with
[1:15:21] the fire I got very much
[1:15:23] yeah I'm a pilot he's a man yes scourged
[1:15:30] you have no power so everything that's
[1:15:35] coming everything that comes against us
[1:15:37] we should look at you might not just
[1:15:51] keep going and then whole trial what did
[1:16:00] that whole trial do before the trial the
[1:16:03] flower comes up dies goes back again
[1:16:06] Nixon comes up in the tree that's the
[1:16:08] same thing a cheese in a cycle as he
[1:16:11] goes within that whole trial
[1:16:15] look at that trial dude open up a
[1:16:16] supernatural around the world women
[1:16:24] speak to him before that trial to happen
[1:16:28] that God would come down and speak to us
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:33] I mean so you know we should just
[1:16:37] rejoice why is this happening to me
[1:16:40] God wants to open you know it's not like
[1:16:52] God has some kind of trial generator and
[1:16:55] heaven pushes a button that does this is
[1:16:56] all throwed this person to this trial
[1:16:58] know he knows what's going to happen to
[1:17:00] you and he does it because he wants the
[1:17:06] first thing where as questioners God are
[1:17:08] you angry at me happen something goes
[1:17:13] sideways and I worry about that wrong
[1:17:15] and it's because we sincere we want to
[1:17:17] serve God and we don't want to displease
[1:17:19] him in any way that's why the first
[1:17:21] question always is Lord have I done
[1:17:23] something wrong to displease you
[1:17:25] right but God doesn't do that God can't
[1:17:29] diminish his love for his bride his love
[1:17:37] is not based on our performance right
[1:17:40] it's not based on it God's love doesn't
[1:17:43] change with how we think we are behaving
[1:17:45] how we are tracking on the graph or
[1:17:47] whatever analytics we seem to have in
[1:17:49] our own life his love is based on
[1:17:53] election right sure he will correct us
[1:17:56] he'll chastise us but it's but but he
[1:17:59] has our best interest in mind
[1:18:01] right he doesn't just do it because he's
[1:18:02] frustrated I'll teach you a lesson you
[1:18:04] know that's not how it works
[1:18:06] he has our correction and mind and he's
[1:18:09] guiding us on a bit away but his love
[1:18:11] has shown an election well how do I know
[1:18:14] I'm elected who's met him who sealed
[1:18:18] into the kingdom that means you're
[1:18:19] elected

[1:18:23] know the Lord brought me out of alcohol
[1:18:25] and party singing all the darkness of
[1:18:27] the world when I wasn't looking for him
[1:18:29] when I was running away he found me he

[1:23:00] something and you said yes look let's
[1:23:02] just read Psalms 27 and then and then we
[1:23:04] need musicians we really do amen let's
[1:23:08] go Sam's 27 brother Brown preaches the
[1:23:19] rapture message from Psalm 27 speaking
[1:23:22] of the condition of the believer that
[1:23:24] it's ready for a rapture amen Laurie I
[1:23:28] mean Sam 27 the Lord is my light and my
[1:23:33] salvation whom shall I fear
[1:23:37] he's my light he guides my path I can
[1:23:40] see where - gonna start workers he's my
[1:23:42] light and he's my salvation he's my
[1:23:44] deliverance hallelujah he's my atonement
[1:23:46] amen whom shall I fear if he's my light
[1:23:49] and my salvation what do I have to fear
[1:23:52] amen the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:23:55] of whom shall I be afraid I mean the
[1:23:58] strength of my life is not me and my
[1:24:00] ability he is the strength of my life
[1:24:02] when the wicked even my enemies and
[1:24:05] my folks come up upon me to eat up my
[1:24:07] flesh they stumbled and fell there was a
[1:24:10] day when when the enemy and my folks
[1:24:12] came upon me to eat up my flesh I
[1:24:14] stumbled and fell there was a day but
[1:24:17] then he came and then and then the
[1:24:20] tables are turned and that same enemy
[1:24:22] came against me it stumbled and fell
[1:24:24] because of him hallelujah
[1:24:27] so our host should encamp against me my
[1:24:30] heart shall not fear that's why we we
[1:24:33] don't need to fear this world I mean we
[1:24:36] don't need to fear the devil sure
[1:24:38] there's been a hundred million or
[1:24:40] whatever devils loosed on the sage that
[1:24:42] weren't before sure the devil's rampant
[1:24:44] but we don't need to fear him
[1:24:46] I mean I've God is greater than all the
[1:24:48] hosts of hell amen our God wouldn't
[1:24:51] allow us to be in this evil age if he
[1:24:53] didn't believe he could keep us in this
[1:24:54] world I mean Jesus said Jesus said I
[1:24:57] don't take them from the world but I
[1:24:59] just pray you be you'd keep them in this
[1:25:00] world amen and that prayer still rings
[1:25:03] true today hallelujah so we don't need
[1:25:05] to worry how bad the world get so we'll
[1:25:07] get bad and the scripture says it will
[1:25:09] wax worse and worse I mean but we don't
[1:25:12] need to be terrified of it because God's
[1:25:14] salvation is always greater than what
[1:25:16] the devil can produce amen so the host
[1:25:19] should encamp against me my heart shall
[1:25:21] not fear though war should arise against
[1:25:24] me and this will I be confident who's
[1:25:27] who said war come against you if you're
[1:25:29] a believer you'll be facing some battles
[1:25:31] hallelujah
[1:25:33] why do you say praise your God to that
[1:25:35] because God is greater than the battle
[1:25:37] God is greater than the enemy I mean one
[1:25:40] thing so and this will I be confident
[1:25:43] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[1:25:45] that I will seek after that I may dwell
[1:25:47] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[1:25:49] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:25:52] and to enquire in his temple from the
[1:25:54] time of trouble this is a time of
[1:25:56] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:25:58] and the secret of his Tabernacle shall
[1:26:02] he hide me he shall set me up upon a
[1:26:04] rock proverb says the third pull is not
[1:26:06] a public show I think that is gardener's
[1:26:10] bride becoming one a man that's a secret
[1:26:13] because the devil don't manufactured he
[1:26:16] doesn't a man he can't produce it
[1:26:19] I mean so this on the time of trouble he
[1:26:21] shall hide me in his pro villian and the
[1:26:23] secret of his tabernacle Shelli hide me
[1:26:25] he shall set me up upon a rock hallelu
[1:26:28] who's who's built upon the rock of
[1:26:29] Revelation amen hallelujah
[1:26:33] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:26:36] mine enemies round about me
[1:26:39] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:26:42] sacrifices of joy I shall sing I'll sing
[1:26:46] praises unto the Lord here our Lord when
[1:26:49] I cry with my voice have mercy also upon

[1:27:15] leave me not neither forsake me O God of
[1:27:17] my salvation when my father and my
[1:27:20] mother forsake me then the Lord will
[1:27:21] take me up teach thee or teach me thy
[1:27:23] way O Lord and lead me in the plain path
