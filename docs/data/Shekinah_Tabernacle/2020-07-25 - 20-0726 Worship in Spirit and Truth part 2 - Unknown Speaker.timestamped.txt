[54:35] down to verse 3 here and many of them
[54:37] that sleep in the dust of the earth
[54:38] shall awake
[54:39] some to everlasting life and some to
[54:42] shame and everlasting contempt
[54:44] and they that be wise shall shine
[54:48] as the brightness of the firmament so
[54:50] they'll shine like the stars in heaven
[54:53] and they that turn many to righteousness
[54:55] as the stars forever
[54:58] and ever amen let's go to ephesians
[55:00] chapter one very familiar piece of
[55:02] scripture
[55:04] to us all i'm sure i'm just going to
[55:05] read the first three
[55:07] verses maybe this must be child proof i
[55:11] can't use it
[55:12] oh no yes we'll come to him later
[55:16] ephesians 1 and from verses 1 down to
[55:19] verse 5
[55:20] or verse 6 rather so paul
[55:23] an apostle if everyone's there
[55:26] of jesus christ by the will of god i
[55:28] like it pretty much every time he
[55:30] addresses the saints
[55:31] i'm an apostle by the will of god not my
[55:33] will it's it's god's will
[55:35] that i'm in this office and it's god's
[55:37] will that we are his bride today
[55:39] i mean to the saints which are at
[55:41] ephesus and to the faithful
[55:42] in christ jesus grace be to you and
[55:45] peace from god our father
[55:47] and from the lord jesus christ so not
[55:49] strife
[55:50] not not not not fear but grace and peace
[55:54] be to you blessed be the god and father
[55:57] of our lord jesus christ who has blessed
[55:59] us
[56:00] us with all spiritual blessings in
[56:03] heavenly places
[56:04] in christ according as he has chosen us
[56:08] before him
[56:09] i mean in him before the foundation of
[56:11] the world that we should be
[56:13] holy and without blame before him in
[56:15] love this is how he chose us this is how
[56:17] he wants us to be
[56:18] and if god wants us to be a certain way
[56:20] we're going to end up that way
[56:21] i mean having predestinated us unto the
[56:24] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[56:27] himself
[56:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[56:29] will to the praise of the glory of his
[56:32] grace when he hath
[56:33] made us accepted in the beloved even
[56:36] everyone say i'm accepted in jesus
[56:37] christ today hallelujah

[58:08] much we thank you for what you're doing
[58:09] in this time lord in jesus christ's name
[58:12] amen amen god bless you may have your
[58:15] seats today
[58:16] um i want to continue on where i was
[58:19] speaking last
[58:20] last week about worshiping him and
[58:22] spirit and truth but i just wanted to
[58:23] drop this in
[58:24] uh this morning now this is this is
[58:27] brother ronnie
[58:28] and um i've mentioned him over the years
[58:30] he was my translator there when
[58:33] the convention was there in garoka a
[58:34] couple of years ago and
[58:36] and it seems to be the lord is using him
[58:38] to share the message and people are
[58:40] coming out of denomination churches are
[58:42] coming out and they're coming into
[58:44] you know and and but he he called me i
[58:46] believe it was friday and he said
[58:48] he said him and his family went to a
[58:49] prayer meeting and when they came back
[58:51] their house had burned down
[58:53] um a car or something hit their house or
[58:55] something happened and
[58:56] the place burned down they lost
[58:58] everything um but he's not asking for
[59:00] sympathy
[59:01] he's just asking for prayer um this
[59:05] this weekend 30 odd people have have
[59:07] come to where he is to be baptized named
[59:09] lord jesus christ
[59:10] they they heard about this happening and
[59:12] they said you know should we uh
[59:13] should we not come you know because of
[59:15] this he said no no this is just the
[59:16] devil trying to upset
[59:18] god's program come anyway so they're
[59:20] being baptized
[59:22] and um mighty things are happening
[59:25] uh but that's why and then but then he
[59:27] said you know pray for me pray for us
[59:28] because there's a lot of people saying
[59:30] that he's bringing a false gospel and
[59:31] all those different things and
[59:32] that's why i have this scripture up here
[59:34] for a great door and effectual
[59:36] is open unto me but there are many
[59:39] adversaries
[59:40] so when the lord opens the door you know
[59:41] there's going to be trouble
[59:43] so keep him in his and his family in
[59:45] prayer uh up there in papua new guinea
[59:48] but there's literally i don't know how
[59:50] many people have
[59:51] have come come into the lord since
[59:55] since those you know that convention a
[59:56] couple of years ago and remember it's a
[59:58] body work
[1:00:00] so whenever one of us goes overseas to
[1:00:01] preach you're preaching
[1:00:03] right remember because we're all you
[1:00:04] know you know it's all the body work so
[1:00:07] uh everything he's doing is actually
[1:00:08] connected to to you here
[1:00:11] amen so anyways but but i put that in
[1:00:14] there because it's interesting because
[1:00:15] sometimes we think we have it hard
[1:00:18] but there's always someone who has it
[1:00:19] harder right but you know sometimes we
[1:00:22] just got to look beyond the natural
[1:00:24] you know you know he's got to maybe
[1:00:26] let's just stop
[1:00:28] or you just say we started well let's
[1:00:29] just stop you know we read in daniel
[1:00:31] that the wise
[1:00:33] will shine as the stars in heaven
[1:00:36] right during this time when there's
[1:00:38] going to be a time of great trouble upon
[1:00:39] the earth as it never has been
[1:00:41] never been you know as is being such a
[1:00:42] nation you know there'll be a time when
[1:00:45] thy people will be delivered every one
[1:00:46] that should be found
[1:00:47] written in the book but he says the wire
[1:00:50] shall shine as the brightness and the
[1:00:51] firmament
[1:00:52] and they shall turn many to
[1:00:53] righteousness as the stars forever and
[1:00:55] ever
[1:00:56] so there has to be a people that are
[1:00:57] wise in this day
[1:00:59] amen but but we know that the wisdom of
[1:01:01] god is not the wisdom of man it's not
[1:01:03] something learned it's not something you
[1:01:04] can
[1:01:05] earn as you know go to a school and get
[1:01:07] a degree and then get post graduate
[1:01:08] study and
[1:01:09] you know become a postdoc and then you
[1:01:11] begin you become a lecturer that's not
[1:01:12] how this works no this is this is a
[1:01:14] different kind of wisdom
[1:01:16] and the wisdom that we speak about is
[1:01:17] holy ghost wisdom
[1:01:19] and the only way to me a person can be
[1:01:21] wise is if they have oil in their lamps
[1:01:23] and their lamp is on fire amen if they
[1:01:25] have the holy ghost burning in their
[1:01:27] lives
[1:01:27] that's the only way people can be wise
[1:01:29] in this hour amen because even it says
[1:01:32] in in proverbs it says here and we'll
[1:01:35] jump back to that one but you know the
[1:01:37] fear of the lord is the beginning of
[1:01:39] wisdom
[1:01:40] and the knowledge of the of the holy is
[1:01:42] understanding so even the fear of
[1:01:43] thought is the beginning of wisdom so
[1:01:45] to me wisdom is when you receive the
[1:01:47] mind of christ which is the holy ghost
[1:01:49] coming and dwelling in your
[1:01:51] in your in your being right so so so the
[1:01:54] fear of the lord will start you on that
[1:01:56] journey
[1:01:57] i mean two you know it's the beginning
[1:01:59] it's the start of wisdom
[1:02:00] but it will should end you up that you
[1:02:02] actually have the lord living in your
[1:02:04] life
[1:02:04] i mean so there's a people now in this
[1:02:07] hour that will
[1:02:08] shine as the stars of the heaven now we
[1:02:10] know that god wrote his first bible
[1:02:13] up in the heaven right so every star is
[1:02:15] in a position
[1:02:16] and it's actually telling a story and
[1:02:18] it's the same thing amen with the people
[1:02:20] upon the earth because we know the
[1:02:22] heavenly host brother brown would speak
[1:02:23] about and
[1:02:24] i believe its greatest bad level fought
[1:02:26] that heavenly host
[1:02:27] should reflect should be a reflection of
[1:02:29] an earthly host
[1:02:31] right so as they are in their position
[1:02:32] they're telling a story they are
[1:02:34] actually speaking
[1:02:35] i mean the stars actually speak the plan
[1:02:37] of redemption i mean to
[1:02:39] to to the earth and it's amazing because
[1:02:41] if you look at um astronomy
[1:02:44] how the earth is actually in the best
[1:02:46] position in the milky way to actually
[1:02:47] observe the heavens
[1:02:49] god put it here that you could see the
[1:02:50] whole plan of redemption i mean if we
[1:02:52] were maybe in another
[1:02:53] galaxy somewhere we wouldn't see what
[1:02:55] we'd see we wouldn't see the zodiac as
[1:02:56] we should
[1:02:57] but god put us here that we could
[1:02:58] actually read the scripture
[1:03:00] i mean actually understand it and i'll
[1:03:02] say that's why god has put us here upon
[1:03:04] the earth
[1:03:04] that we can read the stars we can read
[1:03:06] the scripture and actually understand it
[1:03:08] amen
[1:03:09] and to see our position in it now now we
[1:03:12] have to understand that we're living in
[1:03:13] a day where this is a body work now when
[1:03:15] i
[1:03:15] when i spoke last sunday about the
[1:03:17] dynamics coming into the body
[1:03:19] i mean we know that not all of us are
[1:03:21] called to prophesy
[1:03:22] well we're not all called to speak in
[1:03:24] tongues and even to cast out devils you
[1:03:25] know there was
[1:03:26] you know brother brown um speaks about i
[1:03:28] think it was demus chicarian's wife or
[1:03:30] or or daughter and she would say you
[1:03:32] know i'd fast and pray i'd fast and pray
[1:03:34] and pray
[1:03:34] but i haven't cast out the devil yet and
[1:03:36] and brother baby
[1:03:37] now the reason is god calls you to fast
[1:03:39] and pray and then someone else casts the
[1:03:41] devil out
[1:03:42] right so so it's a body work so so
[1:03:44] whatever position you're called to be in
[1:03:46] the body
[1:03:47] i mean we're going to stand in that
[1:03:48] position well we can't all be deacons we
[1:03:50] can't all be song ladies we can't all
[1:03:52] sing like this we can't all play like
[1:03:54] this
[1:03:54] you know we're not all called to one
[1:03:56] position god
[1:03:58] is not a cookie cutter as brother on
[1:03:59] spencer says it just just smashes us
[1:04:01] into a mold and we come out the same way
[1:04:03] we're all built differently but we have
[1:04:05] to be comfortable in our
[1:04:07] own skin what god has called us to be i
[1:04:09] mean if i'm called to be a teacher let
[1:04:11] me teach with all my strengths if i'm a
[1:04:13] preacher if i'm an evangelist whatever i
[1:04:15] am you know i said to brother johnny
[1:04:16] demoff years ago
[1:04:18] i said it doesn't matter on the delivery
[1:04:20] of a sermon
[1:04:21] some people think you know the
[1:04:22] preacher's got to jump off the pulpit
[1:04:24] and do
[1:04:25] some assaults and then that god's really
[1:04:26] moving no no no it's not the delivery
[1:04:29] it's the power of the
[1:04:30] of the anointed word in a person's life
[1:04:33] so a teacher can say something and it
[1:04:35] can just be talking like this
[1:04:36] and it can deliver a person like this
[1:04:38] because that word is anointed
[1:04:40] right so it's all how the gift operates
[1:04:42] it's all god in different forms right
[1:04:44] but it's god speaking i mean so you know
[1:04:47] so we're all built differently some of
[1:04:48] us are prayer warriors
[1:04:50] some of us want to be prayer warriors
[1:04:52] right some of you know what i mean so
[1:04:53] but i mean
[1:04:54] so but that doesn't mean we shouldn't
[1:04:56] pray but whatever god leads you into
[1:05:00] irrespective of what your flesh wants
[1:05:02] god's moving you into a position
[1:05:05] so it's a body work amen now
[1:05:08] but now though if if
[1:05:13] if we have the holy ghost we truly do
[1:05:16] god will move us into that position
[1:05:18] but it actually has to be us now
[1:05:21] yielding ourselves to him
[1:05:24] you know this world is a world of a
[1:05:26] comfort zone
[1:05:27] you know this first world this first
[1:05:30] world you can tailor your world into
[1:05:32] such a way
[1:05:33] that you don't even need to leave your
[1:05:34] house virtually for anything
[1:05:37] right you can order everything online
[1:05:39] you can order food online people can
[1:05:41] come and fix your house
[1:05:42] you know you can order everything online
[1:05:44] you know you can have such a short
[1:05:45] little comfort zone
[1:05:46] but god doesn't want us in a comfort
[1:05:48] zone god wants us to walk
[1:05:50] with him wherever that is we're going to
[1:05:52] go beyond our
[1:05:53] comfort zone and what we're used to and
[1:05:54] just walk with god
[1:05:56] i mean and actually find the people that
[1:05:58] live the most fulfilling lives
[1:06:00] not just now now i'm not even talking
[1:06:02] about spiritually now i'm talking about
[1:06:03] naturally
[1:06:04] they get out of their comfort zone
[1:06:06] hallelujah
[1:06:08] and we know the thing is when you're
[1:06:09] when you're growing up like for example
[1:06:11] i was at boarding school so your whole
[1:06:12] life was dictated to you
[1:06:14] you had to get out of your comfort zone
[1:06:16] right you had to get up at a certain
[1:06:17] time
[1:06:18] even didn't matter if you're a morning
[1:06:19] person a night person you got up
[1:06:21] right you had to go to breakfast at a
[1:06:23] certain time didn't matter if you wanted
[1:06:24] breakfast not you
[1:06:25] you went you had to dress a certain way
[1:06:27] because you had to have uniform
[1:06:28] everything was
[1:06:29] you know this even after school
[1:06:32] everything you had to get out of your
[1:06:33] comfort zone and you're thrown into a
[1:06:35] boarding house with 70 boys
[1:06:37] you know from all different kind of you
[1:06:39] know uh
[1:06:40] backgrounds and age and everything oh
[1:06:43] boy
[1:06:44] you're you're out of your comfort zone
[1:06:46] and you couldn't really
[1:06:47] you know determine that no i want to
[1:06:49] sleep in this room and this no no no no
[1:06:50] no you got told you had to get out of
[1:06:53] your comfort zone
[1:06:54] right and those who just said okay i'm
[1:06:57] going to push out of this comfort zone
[1:06:58] i'm going to get into this thing
[1:07:00] they enjoyed it right for those who are
[1:07:02] not willing well it was pretty tough
[1:07:03] but anyway but the thing is when you're
[1:07:06] young
[1:07:06] you get kind of forced out of a comfort
[1:07:08] zone but then when you get older then
[1:07:10] you have more choice
[1:07:13] keep pushing it out keep pushing that
[1:07:15] comfort zone
[1:07:16] amen but because if we get too
[1:07:18] comfortable we can actually stop god
[1:07:20] from doing what he wants to do in our
[1:07:21] lives now
[1:07:22] now i want to now i think i i say this a
[1:07:26] lot but i
[1:07:26] you know i find having slides hard
[1:07:29] because
[1:07:30] um you know they never stay in the right
[1:07:33] order
[1:07:38] now we're going to come to that here we
[1:07:40] are see now notice abraham i'm going to
[1:07:42] come back to abraham later now i trust
[1:07:44] this all comes together
[1:07:45] in the end now what was it now god
[1:07:47] called abraham
[1:07:49] because he was a good man no god called
[1:07:52] abraham by election
[1:07:53] god elects people and over in the book
[1:07:57] of
[1:07:57] ephesians the first chapter about the
[1:07:58] fifth verse paul states that the word
[1:08:00] pre-de
[1:08:01] word predestinated us the adoption of
[1:08:04] sons that's the placing of people in the
[1:08:05] body of christ
[1:08:06] that means we're predestinated unto that
[1:08:08] position
[1:08:10] you know it's amazing you know people
[1:08:11] get birthed into the kingdom
[1:08:13] and god does a glorious thing heaven
[1:08:15] comes down and glory fills their soul
[1:08:17] and then we can bring it to wonder am i
[1:08:18] going to make it to my adoption
[1:08:20] of course you're going to make it to
[1:08:21] your adoption because the word called
[1:08:23] you i mean to a birth
[1:08:24] it's going to take you to your place
[1:08:26] hallelujah now paul states and many
[1:08:28] times many of us are actually adopted in
[1:08:30] the body and we don't realize it
[1:08:33] amen brother bam says about a housewife
[1:08:35] being an adopted
[1:08:36] part of the body hallelujah
[1:08:40] remember when you're in your position
[1:08:41] that's power hallelujah you're in your
[1:08:44] land you're in your inheritance and woe
[1:08:45] to any devil that comes upon it
[1:08:47] hallelujah because amen you know where
[1:08:49] you are and about the
[1:08:50] so now that doesn't mean that god just
[1:08:53] puts you
[1:08:54] in a little channel and runs you through
[1:08:56] and you can't help how you go
[1:08:59] right then there would be no reward
[1:09:02] but god gives you the free moral agency
[1:09:04] to make your choice
[1:09:06] but god will keep his believer that
[1:09:08] means that god just doesn't force you
[1:09:10] through a pipe and then you'll be on the
[1:09:11] other side rejoicing no no no
[1:09:13] you've got to give yourself over you're
[1:09:15] going to surrender yourself to the will
[1:09:16] of god for your life
[1:09:18] hallelujah basis but god will keep us
[1:09:20] believer
[1:09:21] i mean so so we have to keep that in in
[1:09:24] perspective
[1:09:25] now the wise will
[1:09:29] the wise have the holy ghost the mind
[1:09:32] let this mind mindless in christ be
[1:09:34] in you and this is the age where the
[1:09:36] mind of christ is definitely in a people
[1:09:39] now here here here's a picture picture
[1:09:42] you know
[1:09:43] you know there's a thousand words or
[1:09:44] whatever here's the wise and here's the
[1:09:46] foolish
[1:09:47] now we're living in this era and and you
[1:09:50] can see there's some here and they know
[1:09:52] they have no oil
[1:09:54] one's just pouring the oil in and it's
[1:09:55] going to be lit others this one's saying
[1:09:58] sorry you got to go by
[1:09:59] we're going this way you know go by you
[1:10:02] know and but but these ones are wise
[1:10:04] these are the wise ones because they
[1:10:06] have oil in their vessel
[1:10:08] hallelujah and so now they know what to
[1:10:10] do with the word
[1:10:11] in their day hallelujah these ones are
[1:10:14] just going along for the ride and and
[1:10:16] i just want to maybe you know don't just
[1:10:18] go along for the ride
[1:10:20] don't just come to church for the ride
[1:10:22] don't just be a believer just for the
[1:10:23] ride and everyone else is doing it this
[1:10:24] is my circle and
[1:10:26] you know no no we want to have an
[1:10:27] individual walk right we want to know
[1:10:29] him in the power of his resurrection
[1:10:31] as a reality in this day amen hallelujah
[1:10:34] i pray god help us this hour
[1:10:35] you know this is this is incredible
[1:10:37] where where god would actually put his
[1:10:39] mind in a people
[1:10:40] i mean anything and those people would
[1:10:42] see the world through the eyes
[1:10:44] as god would see them right so so they
[1:10:47] would think about things as god would
[1:10:48] think about them
[1:10:49] their heart would be god's heart holly
[1:10:52] they would they would treat others as
[1:10:53] god would treat others
[1:10:56] incredible thing really when you take
[1:10:57] people you know it says in the scripture
[1:11:00] not one man seeketh after god we're
[1:11:02] actually built not we're actually
[1:11:04] physically built not to look after him i
[1:11:06] mean i mean look look look after him
[1:11:07] seek him
[1:11:08] right but there's something that goes
[1:11:10] beyond that beyond this that's down in
[1:11:12] the soul
[1:11:13] and god begins to call that person
[1:11:15] harley and i don't know where you were
[1:11:17] but i was in a dark place but then a
[1:11:19] light came
[1:11:20] this message came my way i mean heaven
[1:11:23] came down and glory filled my soul
[1:11:25] hallelujah
[1:11:27] amen you know and now our lives are no
[1:11:30] longer the same
[1:11:32] amen amen yeah it was amazing i was
[1:11:35] talking to the girls last night about
[1:11:37] martin luther
[1:11:38] and martin luther you know you know i
[1:11:40] may have may may kind of condense the
[1:11:42] story real
[1:11:43] real down but he was a catholic priest
[1:11:45] and he sincerely
[1:11:46] wanted to serve god and he did all the
[1:11:49] things catholics did and you know tried
[1:11:51] and he tried and he just
[1:11:52] failed but then i think one of his
[1:11:54] superiors gave him a bible
[1:11:57] and he was reading the book of romans
[1:11:59] and he came to the place where he said
[1:12:00] the just
[1:12:01] shall live by faith and that little few
[1:12:04] words
[1:12:05] changed his life and change actually the
[1:12:07] course of history
[1:12:09] i mean we're just the just shall live by
[1:12:11] faith hallelujah he read that and it's
[1:12:13] like a whole weight came off
[1:12:14] him and he realized it's not my my work
[1:12:17] serving a man-made system that
[1:12:19] that that saves me but my faith in jesus
[1:12:21] christ i'm justified by my faith
[1:12:23] and and a big weight of sin fell off his
[1:12:25] shoulders and he was freed by
[1:12:27] just by one scripture hallelujah and the
[1:12:30] whole world was changed by it
[1:12:32] hallelujah now and you know i was
[1:12:34] telling them i said now if one scripture
[1:12:36] can do that for someone
[1:12:37] what about a whole book what about every
[1:12:40] promise of god
[1:12:42] if one can change the world what about
[1:12:44] the whole book
[1:12:45] what could it do hallelujah amen
[1:12:48] but the wise recognize what they have
[1:12:52] hallelujah but isn't that you know i i
[1:12:55] think it impacted me that more
[1:12:56] impacted them i was thinking about that
[1:12:58] just it's just
[1:12:59] the just shall live by faith if i can
[1:13:02] count six words
[1:13:04] change his life and then john weasley
[1:13:07] after he
[1:13:08] he i think he failed in england i mean i
[1:13:10] mean i mean america came back to england
[1:13:12] and and and and they had a group there
[1:13:14] and someone was reading
[1:13:15] uh martin luther's um commentary on the
[1:13:19] book of romans
[1:13:20] it says like a warming just filled his
[1:13:22] heart hallelujah
[1:13:25] change the world again amen
[1:13:28] there's a power in faith hallelujah
[1:13:31] faith we have will change our bodies i
[1:13:34] mean remember the word gives you
[1:13:35] rapturing faith
[1:13:37] hallelujah so the wise now there's a
[1:13:39] people upon the earth that can actually
[1:13:41] walk in this world and they're not
[1:13:42] caught up in this world
[1:13:44] you know this might come out wrong but
[1:13:45] i've been thinking about it you know
[1:13:47] there's people around the world
[1:13:48] tearing down statues because your people
[1:13:50] are you know
[1:13:52] confronting the past now to me they're
[1:13:54] tearing down the wrong statues
[1:13:56] okay well what do you mean is it because
[1:13:58] the people they're tearing down no no
[1:14:00] no there are statues you know a statue
[1:14:03] is a monument based on a historical
[1:14:04] event
[1:14:05] right and that country rallies around
[1:14:07] history
[1:14:09] now you can take a statue and people
[1:14:11] glorifying things
[1:14:13] but there's other kind of statues that
[1:14:14] need to be torn down
[1:14:16] and they are statues that are in
[1:14:18] people's hearts
[1:14:19] they are monuments to things in the past
[1:14:22] i mean that people carry around in their
[1:14:24] hearts
[1:14:25] right pain i mean traumatic events in
[1:14:28] their life
[1:14:29] i mean bitterness maybe their their
[1:14:32] their
[1:14:32] their parents hurt them and now they're
[1:14:35] carrying the statue around
[1:14:37] and their whole life is being dictated
[1:14:39] to by a history
[1:14:40] that's the kind of statues that need to
[1:14:42] be torn down i mean their hearts has
[1:14:44] changed
[1:14:45] hardly they were no longer living by
[1:14:47] things in the past are you following me
[1:14:49] you know i don't agree with all the
[1:14:50] statues and whatever they do that's them
[1:14:52] but you know
[1:14:52] we can't walk around living
[1:14:55] in the past amen hallelujah
[1:14:58] that's the kind of statues your
[1:15:00] indifference unbelief i mean whatever
[1:15:02] the devil puts in someone's life that
[1:15:04] appears to be so important
[1:15:05] tear it down let god let god tear it
[1:15:08] down today well you know some people are
[1:15:11] just so
[1:15:11] caught up in you know physical needs and
[1:15:14] you know things and
[1:15:15] but there's people like this that they
[1:15:16] lose everything they just keep walking
[1:15:18] with god
[1:15:19] i mean they're not worried about it he
[1:15:20] doesn't have he can't go to the
[1:15:22] government and get a
[1:15:23] you know go on the dole and things he's
[1:15:25] up in his 50s at least
[1:15:26] you know but he's got children he's got
[1:15:28] to look after he says no no
[1:15:30] just pray for us this word's going forth
[1:15:32] people are coming to the lord
[1:15:34] hallelujah i say i say that's a wise man
[1:15:37] man because the devil will try and throw
[1:15:38] us off the road with everything he can
[1:15:40] i mean but the wise will continue on the
[1:15:42] road hallelujah
[1:15:45] amen so i hope that came out right but
[1:15:48] you know
[1:15:49] you know people you rewrite history
[1:15:53] but it doesn't convert anyone it doesn't
[1:15:55] take them to heaven i'm interested in
[1:15:56] people going to heaven
[1:15:58] that's my agenda i don't have any other
[1:16:00] kind of agenda i want to see
[1:16:02] i want to see all of us around the
[1:16:03] throne
[1:16:05] that's what i want to see all the same
[1:16:07] age rejoicing
[1:16:09] hallelujah we made it hallelujah we can
[1:16:11] shake each other by the hand and say we
[1:16:12] made it
[1:16:13] god got us here hallelujah
[1:16:16] hallelujah you know we can sit down and
[1:16:20] reminisce
[1:16:21] for a thousand years and then another
[1:16:23] thousand years and we go up
[1:16:24] go up into the great city and sit at his
[1:16:27] feet i don't know how it's going to be
[1:16:28] but it's going to be good
[1:16:29] you know what i mean hallelujah
[1:16:33] glory to god so there's the people that
[1:16:36] will come to their position in this day
[1:16:39] and god will get us there now brother
[1:16:40] brahmi says
[1:16:43] he says this and he and he mentions this
[1:16:45] all the way through
[1:16:46] through his ministry we'll come back to
[1:16:48] that
[1:16:50] this isn't uh the identified christ of
[1:16:53] all ages
[1:16:54] and the word is a thought made manifest
[1:16:57] you think
[1:16:58] you think it then speak it like i say
[1:17:01] the light i had to think light before i
[1:17:03] said light
[1:17:03] microphone i have to say or think
[1:17:06] microphone
[1:17:06] before i say to say microphone and we
[1:17:09] are god's
[1:17:10] attributes displayed so we are god's
[1:17:13] attributes
[1:17:14] his thoughts made flesh he thought of us
[1:17:18] he spoke us and here we are amen right
[1:17:21] hallelujah but notice what he goes into
[1:17:24] after he he says this
[1:17:27] and i find out i find two classes of
[1:17:30] people
[1:17:31] as it goes along so there's after the
[1:17:33] seals are open
[1:17:34] this is after the words come open you
[1:17:37] know all those
[1:17:38] but but he mentions this all the way
[1:17:40] through his ministry
[1:17:41] and i find out i find two classes of
[1:17:43] people as it goes along one of them
[1:17:45] is the fundamentalists and on and the
[1:17:48] other one is the pentecostals
[1:17:50] now the pentecostals got something but
[1:17:52] they don't know who they are
[1:17:54] right and the fundamentalists know
[1:17:56] something but it ain't got nothing with
[1:17:58] it
[1:17:59] so now there it's just like a man having
[1:18:01] money in the bank
[1:18:02] and can't write a check the other one
[1:18:05] can write a check
[1:18:06] got no money in the bank if you could
[1:18:09] ever get
[1:18:09] that thing together it would be a great
[1:18:12] thing
[1:18:13] right to those who love to spend but
[1:18:16] have nothing to spend
[1:18:18] and those who have everything to spend
[1:18:19] but can't spend it
[1:18:21] so there's the stingy who won't spend it
[1:18:23] those are the fundamentalists
[1:18:24] right there's the pentecostals who who
[1:18:26] want to spend everything but they've got
[1:18:28] nothing to spend
[1:18:29] he says if we can ever get these two
[1:18:31] together it will be a great thing now
[1:18:34] now to me this is just my mind you're
[1:18:36] being able to read that kind of thing
[1:18:37] you think how can we get these two
[1:18:38] together
[1:18:40] don't we we say how can we join these
[1:18:42] two because
[1:18:43] you know we always find these two
[1:18:45] classes of people and they're all the
[1:18:46] way down to 2020.
[1:18:48] right and this is not the peanut cut
[1:18:50] this is not out there this is
[1:18:52] in in the realm of the bride of christ
[1:18:55] amen but now the only way that they will
[1:18:58] come together as god puts them together
[1:19:00] right that that god would send a word
[1:19:03] into our agent he has that will actually
[1:19:05] make a people
[1:19:06] that have all the money in the bank they
[1:19:08] recognize that their bank is the bank of
[1:19:10] heaven it's not the bank of new zealand
[1:19:12] it's not it's not the federal reserve
[1:19:13] whatever
[1:19:14] it's the bank of heaven right and they
[1:19:16] have a checkbook
[1:19:17] where the lord jesus put his name signed
[1:19:19] in the blood of jesus christ it says
[1:19:21] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:19:24] hallelujah so
[1:19:25] it's those kind of people that will will
[1:19:27] will be manifested in this end time so
[1:19:29] now if we can just find this here
[1:19:33] brother abraham says this now like
[1:19:36] israel this is the feast of the trumpets
[1:19:37] i believe
[1:19:38] like israel back in her promised land
[1:19:40] sorry there wasn't any
[1:19:41] espanol for this for this message um
[1:19:45] she don't know how she got back there
[1:19:47] she just automatically put back there
[1:19:49] why
[1:19:50] national force put her in her place now
[1:19:52] i'm going to say something
[1:19:54] national force put israel in her
[1:19:56] homeland national force
[1:19:58] will put the church in the world council
[1:20:00] of churches but the power of god will
[1:20:02] put the people
[1:20:03] in the bride right as the power of god
[1:20:07] will put the people in the bride now you
[1:20:09] just take that little thought there
[1:20:11] and you run it through the scripture
[1:20:13] what put caleb on his mountain the power
[1:20:15] of god
[1:20:16] right wasn't because he was different to
[1:20:18] any of the other israelites
[1:20:20] no the power of god moved on his heart
[1:20:22] he says give me this mountain
[1:20:23] doesn't matter about the scars remember
[1:20:25] he could have had a lot of statues in
[1:20:27] his heart of being a slave
[1:20:28] but those were actually pulled down and
[1:20:30] all that was put in as hard as i have a
[1:20:32] promise
[1:20:33] i have a position in the word and i'm
[1:20:35] here to fulfill that position
[1:20:36] hallelujah says give me my mountain i
[1:20:39] mean so the power of god
[1:20:40] actually put him in his pl position i
[1:20:43] mean the power of god
[1:20:44] put david on the throne hallelujah
[1:20:47] it wasn't david's ability that put him
[1:20:49] on the throne it wasn't david's ability
[1:20:51] that killed the lion and killed the bear
[1:20:53] and killed goliath
[1:20:54] that was the anointing of god hallelujah
[1:20:56] to put him on the throne
[1:20:58] amen and we can go through even the
[1:21:00] apostles you know we go through the
[1:21:01] prophet of god's life
[1:21:03] we can go through our lives as the power
[1:21:05] of god
[1:21:06] will put us into the bride of christ but
[1:21:08] i really want to say it that
[1:21:09] we are there right we are there
[1:21:13] amen now don't look at me mr
[1:21:15] fundamentalist and say i know that
[1:21:17] but you got nothing in the bank or you
[1:21:19] know or or mr pentecostal
[1:21:21] uh well i don't know that but i got all
[1:21:23] this money just i got all this faith
[1:21:25] right you know you're going to say no
[1:21:26] you've got to recognize where are we
[1:21:29] who are we not who are we becoming who
[1:21:32] are we remember when when when when when
[1:21:35] moses looked out on the um
[1:21:37] you know um israelites are slaves in
[1:21:40] egypt
[1:21:40] he saw the children of god he saw god's
[1:21:43] son
[1:21:44] and then god said out of egypt i've
[1:21:46] called my son
[1:21:47] they they were knee-deep or whatever
[1:21:49] deep in mud and they were making bricks
[1:21:51] and all that stuff and god said this is
[1:21:52] my heritage
[1:21:54] this is my children they'll not become
[1:21:56] my children because they cross the
[1:21:58] border from egypt into the promised land
[1:21:59] that does not make them my children they
[1:22:01] already were by birth
[1:22:03] they were living under a promise right
[1:22:05] they are living under a promise that god
[1:22:07] said you're going to come and dwell in
[1:22:08] the promised land
[1:22:10] hallelujah so they were already sons of
[1:22:12] god
[1:22:13] sons and daughters of god they already
[1:22:15] were
[1:22:16] right and then god had to call them amen
[1:22:19] and those who responded to the call
[1:22:21] said yes i'm coming holy yes i'm coming
[1:22:24] and and and they had to realize i do not
[1:22:26] become a son i already was a son
[1:22:29] but because the word became alive and me
[1:22:31] i mean that's
[1:22:32] that's actually god making you recognize
[1:22:34] you're a son and daughter of god
[1:22:36] right it's really us that our eyes need
[1:22:37] to come open that's why that's why god
[1:22:39] pours the spirit out service after
[1:22:41] service you pray and god comes down
[1:22:43] he changes your life and he quickens his
[1:22:45] word to your heart and you
[1:22:47] and you realize i'm not from this world
[1:22:48] i'm not from a church and from heaven
[1:22:50] that's god trying to get your attention
[1:22:53] you're my child
[1:22:54] you're my son you're my daughter that's
[1:22:56] why that's why my word has an effect in
[1:22:58] your life because you
[1:23:00] are my child hallelujah
[1:23:03] so now if we are as children i have a
[1:23:06] checkbook
[1:23:08] from the bank of heaven remember it's
[1:23:11] not it's not what i consider me to be
[1:23:13] it's what god says i am holier caleb
[1:23:17] could have still been drenched in mud
[1:23:19] saying i want my mountain
[1:23:21] you know he said hold on you're not
[1:23:22] ready no no i was born ready
[1:23:24] remember david was carrying food down to
[1:23:26] his brothers and the badly just heard
[1:23:28] you know goliath his boss fell on the
[1:23:30] wrong ears that day
[1:23:31] bring me a man something in him said
[1:23:33] david said hold on
[1:23:35] where's that coming from that guy that
[1:23:38] guy right there
[1:23:39] you know he was just serving his dad and
[1:23:41] all that stuff then you know he wasn't
[1:23:43] like i'm gonna kill a giant today when
[1:23:44] he woke up
[1:23:45] i'm gonna you know how should i stand
[1:23:47] when i kill this you know he wasn't he
[1:23:49] wasn't planning nothing he's just he's
[1:23:50] just serving in the body
[1:23:52] you just serve in the body of christ and
[1:23:55] when the devil comes your way hallelujah
[1:23:56] you know you don't have to plan it it'll
[1:23:58] just happen
[1:23:59] but then when the devil comes your way
[1:24:01] hallelujah he came to the wrong person
[1:24:04] i remember we're a predestinated people
[1:24:06] amen that every devil will be under our
[1:24:08] feet
[1:24:09] and brother ham said eve was ordained to
[1:24:11] fall but this bride is ordained that she
[1:24:12] cannot fall
[1:24:13] i mean she cannot fall to the deception
[1:24:16] of the devil
[1:24:18] ah but i'm sick i have this need i have
[1:24:20] this need to know but are you walking in
[1:24:22] faith
[1:24:23] are you walking in faith hallelujah
[1:24:26] because it's the biggest challenge has
[1:24:28] always been through the ages will they
[1:24:29] take
[1:24:30] god at his word or will they take what
[1:24:31] the devil says
[1:24:34] right and and that's always the battle
[1:24:37] but we have but i believe i have to be
[1:24:39] looking at a people that say i just
[1:24:41] i just believe this something in me says
[1:24:45] it's true it's for me it's not for the
[1:24:48] future it's for now
[1:24:50] hallelujah this word is yan amen i don't
[1:24:52] know how it's going to be fulfilled
[1:24:54] that's not my business that's god's
[1:24:55] business
[1:24:56] hallelujah do you think do you think
[1:24:58] mary had to go and become a doctor
[1:25:00] i mean and and and work out how wombs
[1:25:02] work and all that thing you know you
[1:25:04] know
[1:25:04] to become pregnant she didn't run down
[1:25:07] to the local hospital and say now tell
[1:25:08] me how
[1:25:09] how do the birds and the bees and show
[1:25:10] me all you know how does that all work
[1:25:12] she didn't have to work that out she
[1:25:13] just took god at his word
[1:25:15] hallelujah and that you know and it was
[1:25:18] god's
[1:25:18] it was god's responsibility to bring it
[1:25:20] to pass
[1:25:22] amen now where are we
[1:25:26] yes but the power of god will put the
[1:25:28] people in the bride
[1:25:30] and we should be able to say amen
[1:25:34] that's happened it put me in the bride
[1:25:37] hallelujah god's power did remember it's
[1:25:40] not him that willeth or runneth but to
[1:25:42] god child's mercy
[1:25:43] and he hath he showed me a lot of mercy
[1:25:46] hallelujah
[1:25:47] amen but his spirit put me in the bride
[1:25:49] the power of god
[1:25:51] amen will put the people to the bride
[1:25:54] the world forces this way and the world
[1:25:56] forces that way but god forces upward
[1:25:59] the spirit of god which is the word of
[1:26:01] god my word is spirit and life
[1:26:03] will put the bride in her place because
[1:26:06] she'll recognize
[1:26:08] her position in the word then she's in
[1:26:11] christ
[1:26:12] now when you think about now no
[1:26:15] this is me and maybe i'm anyway but when
[1:26:17] you read about you know read those kind
[1:26:19] of words she'll
[1:26:20] recognize her position sometimes it can
[1:26:23] put a pressure on people now i've got to
[1:26:25] work it out
[1:26:26] you know that we have to mentally work
[1:26:28] it out and you know you know it's kind
[1:26:29] of like a maths question at school
[1:26:32] you got to open these brackets and do
[1:26:33] this and integrate and differentiate and
[1:26:37] you know all those things some of us
[1:26:40] know what that is and some of us
[1:26:41] are happy we're forgotten you know
[1:26:45] but it's not something you know it's not
[1:26:47] something we have to mentally work out
[1:26:50] remember the god of the bible reveals
[1:26:52] himself you just
[1:26:54] this is the pattern of the bible god
[1:26:56] before the beginning had a burden
[1:26:58] i want a family i want to have relate i
[1:27:00] want to have a relationship with people
[1:27:02] and they'll love me and i'll love them
[1:27:04] and i'll prove my love to them and
[1:27:05] they'll respond and love me back
[1:27:08] so he made this universe he made this
[1:27:10] earth he put adam and eve upon
[1:27:12] upon this earth he began to reveal
[1:27:14] himself to them
[1:27:16] and then the devil comes in you know as
[1:27:18] soon as
[1:27:19] i'm not sure what that means okay
[1:27:22] i thought i was getting signals but i
[1:27:24] was never in the army
[1:27:25] anyway you know and then and then and
[1:27:27] then sin came in and
[1:27:28] and god's masterpiece was mad but god
[1:27:32] cannot be defeated so he begins to
[1:27:33] rebuild
[1:27:35] and then down through the scripture
[1:27:36] because it's remember it's god's burden
[1:27:38] i want to have relationship i want to
[1:27:40] know people i want people to know me i
[1:27:42] want to love people and people love me
[1:27:44] you know as a response this is god's
[1:27:47] heart all the way through the scripture
[1:27:49] so he came to enoch enoch loved him
[1:27:53] he walked with god yeah enoch didn't
[1:27:54] wake up one day saying i'm going to walk
[1:27:56] with god
[1:27:57] i'm 65 years old you know and i'm going
[1:28:00] to walk with him 300 years
[1:28:01] then he's going to take me in a rapture
[1:28:02] no no he was doing whatever he was doing
[1:28:05] and then and then god came to him and
[1:28:07] god began to call him
[1:28:09] and he responded to the call and and
[1:28:11] then he began to walk
[1:28:12] and then one day he got so far up up the
[1:28:15] ladder
[1:28:15] god said you just want to keep coming
[1:28:19] yes hallelujah how could you say no to
[1:28:23] that kind of call you know so it was god
[1:28:25] calling
[1:28:26] and enoch responding right moses tried
[1:28:29] to moses knew he was a son of promise he
[1:28:31] knew he was the serpent bruiser
[1:28:33] right that was going to deliver israel
[1:28:35] out of the hand of the egyptians
[1:28:36] he knew he was ordained for that job but
[1:28:39] when he tried to figure it out
[1:28:41] he killed one guy and that was it and
[1:28:44] and
[1:28:44] and he ran away as a runaway prophet
[1:28:46] because he failed
[1:28:47] but then because why he was trying to
[1:28:49] act before god revealed himself
[1:28:52] amen and then now suddenly he's he's
[1:28:56] 80 years old he's basically forgotten
[1:28:58] maybe the call and he's looking after
[1:29:00] his father-in-law's sheep
[1:29:01] and then the bush is on fire god wanted
[1:29:04] relationship
[1:29:06] he's my son he's been on the run he's
[1:29:08] been there for 80 years and i mean
[1:29:10] yo he's now 80 years old yo i want a
[1:29:12] relationship with him
[1:29:15] and he comes down the burning bush he
[1:29:16] speaks and moses responds
[1:29:19] hallelujah joshua lived an incredible
[1:29:22] life
[1:29:23] he was with moses many times when god
[1:29:25] came down
[1:29:27] amen incredible things he saw but he had
[1:29:30] to meet that same god for himself
[1:29:32] hallelujah and then now here comes heck
[1:29:34] you know he
[1:29:36] they're about to cross jordan you know
[1:29:38] or maybe they had already by that stage
[1:29:40] you guys should know the detail you
[1:29:42] barber readers yep
[1:29:44] and then the captain of the host came
[1:29:45] down and he and he just saw him as a
[1:29:48] regular looking man with a sword
[1:29:50] because he's the euphoria against us he
[1:29:52] said no no
[1:29:53] i'm not for you and i'm not against you
[1:29:55] i've come to take over your battle
[1:29:57] right and then so joshua responded to
[1:29:59] how god revealed himself
[1:30:01] so he realized now this is not me going
[1:30:03] to lead this campaign but god has come
[1:30:05] down
[1:30:06] to take over this campaign i mean that
[1:30:08] he will lead us in the battle and it's
[1:30:10] the same thing with you and i
[1:30:11] i mean it's not that if jesus is on our
[1:30:14] side but if we are we on jesus side
[1:30:17] hallelujah that's the key amen so now
[1:30:19] here here he is
[1:30:20] he just lays himself at the feet of the
[1:30:22] captain
[1:30:23] and then that captain leads him all the
[1:30:24] way through why because god wanted
[1:30:26] relationship
[1:30:27] amen hallelujah and you come down to a
[1:30:30] library you go down all through the
[1:30:32] scripture
[1:30:33] yes it's the same thing isaiah is there
[1:30:36] in the temple
[1:30:37] he just had a big big big heartache in
[1:30:39] his life because the king that he loved
[1:30:41] so much and he
[1:30:42] leaned upon his shoulder so much now
[1:30:44] became a leper
[1:30:45] and it was in the year that he died he's
[1:30:48] in distress
[1:30:50] and he's in the temple praying to god
[1:30:51] saying god what's going on
[1:30:53] and then and then he sees the lord high
[1:30:55] and lifted up he saw a vision of god
[1:30:57] high above with his train filled the
[1:30:59] temple and
[1:31:00] and the burden that he went in with i
[1:31:02] think it left him
[1:31:04] because he was he was god saying i want
[1:31:07] relationship with my son
[1:31:08] amen but he's leaning too much on the
[1:31:11] shoulder of this king
[1:31:13] so i've got to take this earthly
[1:31:14] influence away i mean that i can reveal
[1:31:16] himself to my son and god has to do that
[1:31:19] sometimes
[1:31:20] hallelujah abraham wanted to bring all
[1:31:23] of his family worth when god called him
[1:31:25] that's an individual walk amen
[1:31:29] he had to be willing just to walk with
[1:31:31] god
[1:31:32] amen anyway and then and then and then
[1:31:35] god
[1:31:35] speaks to isaiah because why god wanted
[1:31:38] a relationship with isaiah
[1:31:40] i'm repeating this because this is this
[1:31:41] is all the way down through the old
[1:31:42] testament
[1:31:43] god reveals himself and the people
[1:31:45] respond to him
[1:31:47] hallelujah and they take god at his word
[1:31:49] and they act upon it now that is the god
[1:31:51] of the bible
[1:31:53] because you see the same thing in the
[1:31:54] new testament
[1:31:56] god has manifested in flesh and jesus
[1:31:58] christ and he goes by the way of peter
[1:32:00] james and john come follow me
[1:32:03] and then god began to reveal himself to
[1:32:05] to the apostles and they responded to
[1:32:07] that call
[1:32:08] and then finally there's the um you know
[1:32:09] yo the apostle paul on the road to
[1:32:11] damascus
[1:32:12] he's going to tear this thing up he's
[1:32:14] sick of this all this fanatics and all
[1:32:15] this crazy stuff going on
[1:32:17] you know he's going to put an end to
[1:32:18] this but then the god of the old
[1:32:20] testament which was jesus christ
[1:32:23] came and revealed himself to the apostle
[1:32:24] paul on the road to damascus and what
[1:32:26] apollo he responded
[1:32:28] who are you lord i am jesus whom you
[1:32:30] persecute
[1:32:31] oh boy imagine having a real shaving
[1:32:34] down
[1:32:35] oh boy but but he had to have that
[1:32:37] experience then he began to know the
[1:32:38] grace of god and begin to know god in
[1:32:40] the power of his resurrection
[1:32:41] he didn't know that beforehand i mean
[1:32:44] but he knew it then
[1:32:46] and that same god is the same god today
[1:32:49] right the same god that reveals himself
[1:32:51] then is the same god the reveal
[1:32:52] reveals himself in the same way today he
[1:32:55] sends his word
[1:32:56] hallelujah amen he manifests himself
[1:33:00] and we see that manifestation and we
[1:33:02] respond to him
[1:33:03] hallelujah and we take him at his word
[1:33:05] and then he begins to fulfill that word
[1:33:07] in our lives
[1:33:08] remember he hasn't called us just to
[1:33:10] make us religious
[1:33:11] he hasn't called us just to have a
[1:33:13] church no he's called us remember we're
[1:33:15] under a a specific message
[1:33:18] and that message is going to do a
[1:33:19] specific thing what's it going to do
[1:33:21] change our bodies
[1:33:22] remember that's the reason that it came
[1:33:24] it's not just no your
[1:33:25] you know that with no mystery so that is
[1:33:27] good but it came to change our bodies
[1:33:30] i mean to bring the dead in christ from
[1:33:32] the grave hallelujah and to change our
[1:33:34] mortal bodies
[1:33:36] that's the point of the whole message
[1:33:39] hallelujah that god would be god would
[1:33:42] express his love to a people
[1:33:44] and those people would love him out of
[1:33:45] their free choice back with all their
[1:33:47] lives in their hearts amen hallelujah
[1:33:51] amen so now his word his spirit
[1:33:55] my word is spirit and life will put the
[1:33:57] bride in her place
[1:33:59] so now he's saying that god's word this
[1:34:02] message is going to put a people
[1:34:04] in their place that they have all the
[1:34:06] money in the bank
[1:34:07] and they have all the checks hallelujah
[1:34:10] you know it used to be i i think checks
[1:34:12] are being phased out nowadays i think
[1:34:14] you know you know it's like a what we
[1:34:17] call a floppy disk you know there was a
[1:34:19] couple of years ago my old job we found
[1:34:21] some
[1:34:21] and some of the older colleagues took
[1:34:23] them to the younger ones than me said
[1:34:25] you know what this is
[1:34:26] and they had to think real real hard is
[1:34:29] it
[1:34:29] a save icon you know what is it
[1:34:32] now we used to save stuff on this how
[1:34:35] many gig can you fit gig
[1:34:36] what are you doing you know but you know
[1:34:39] what i mean i mean so
[1:34:41] so it's like a checkbook many of us
[1:34:44] don't know what checkbooks are
[1:34:46] but there comes a time when the
[1:34:47] checkbook runs out you've got to get a
[1:34:48] new one
[1:34:49] because you use all your checks god's
[1:34:51] checkbook isn't that way
[1:34:52] it never runs out of pages hallelujah so
[1:34:56] his so there'll be a people that will be
[1:34:59] put
[1:35:00] in their place because she'll recognize
[1:35:03] her position
[1:35:04] in the word then she's in christ now
[1:35:08] what does it mean to recognize our
[1:35:10] position in the word
[1:35:12] it's to recognize who we are in the lord
[1:35:16] right we you know what are we
[1:35:19] this is a very probably very ver well we
[1:35:22] are christians we are you know but what
[1:35:24] are we
[1:35:25] we are prophecy made manifest
[1:35:29] this is what the bride is prophecy made
[1:35:31] manifest
[1:35:32] well what is prophecy god's thoughts
[1:35:35] being spoken upon the earth when he said
[1:35:38] let there be light he thought about it
[1:35:41] he spoke
[1:35:42] it it became material right
[1:35:45] when he said i'm gonna have a bride
[1:35:46] without spot or wrinkle washed in the
[1:35:48] blood of the lamb
[1:35:50] rejoice because the marriage of the lamb
[1:35:51] has come right
[1:35:53] what was that that was he thought it
[1:35:56] yeah and then he spoke it
[1:35:58] now it has to become material amen no
[1:36:01] but when he thought about that
[1:36:02] yo the marriage of the lamb has come it
[1:36:05] wasn't just a blanket audition
[1:36:08] though it is for everyone if they will
[1:36:10] accept it right because it's to
[1:36:12] whomsoever we'll let them come
[1:36:14] right we know that but when god thought
[1:36:16] about that
[1:36:17] he thought about every single bride
[1:36:19] member
[1:36:21] amen where they came from their age how
[1:36:24] tall how fat
[1:36:25] how thin how much hair how little here
[1:36:27] our bigger eyebrows are our nose out
[1:36:29] whatever
[1:36:30] he knew everything about us our family
[1:36:34] our forebears their problems our parents
[1:36:37] problems our problems he knew all about
[1:36:41] it glory he knew where would be
[1:36:45] you know what color would be whatever he
[1:36:48] knew
[1:36:49] all the detail of all of those bride
[1:36:51] members
[1:36:52] yes right amen didn't he because he he's
[1:36:55] not a finite god
[1:36:56] you know it's not like we kind of some
[1:36:58] you know like you build a house
[1:37:00] and you and you look at the plans and
[1:37:03] you have an idea of what it'll look like
[1:37:05] but you don't really know what it'll
[1:37:06] look like until it's built
[1:37:08] god ain't that way he has the full
[1:37:11] image in his mind because his thoughts
[1:37:13] are different to us
[1:37:14] right so so when he said let us be glad
[1:37:17] and rejoice for the marriage of the
[1:37:18] you know the marriage of the lamb has
[1:37:20] come revelations 19 and
[1:37:22] his wife has made herself ready he knew
[1:37:25] exactly
[1:37:26] are you all following me i trust this
[1:37:27] means something to you because you
[1:37:29] actually realize
[1:37:30] i'm a fulfillment of prophecy
[1:37:33] i'm a fulfillment of revelations 19.
[1:37:37] hallelujah where where god thought of it
[1:37:39] just like when he
[1:37:40] when he spoke to abraham and said your
[1:37:42] seed is going to sojourn in a strange
[1:37:44] land
[1:37:45] remember you know i heard brother john
[1:37:47] andy say it
[1:37:48] you could probably know where i'm going
[1:37:49] with a lot of things i say
[1:37:52] but let it minister to you i mean don't
[1:37:55] don't don't let it become a predictable
[1:37:56] outcome though it might be
[1:37:58] but just just just enjoy the ride and
[1:38:00] let it minister
[1:38:02] i mean so so so abraham was told by god
[1:38:04] your seat is going to sojourn in a
[1:38:06] strange land 400 years
[1:38:07] i'm going to bring them out with a
[1:38:08] mighty hand in his mind
[1:38:11] he knew moses moses was in that prophecy
[1:38:15] caleb was in that prophecy miriam was in
[1:38:18] that prophecy aaron was in that prophecy
[1:38:20] korra even day through that prophecy all
[1:38:22] of them were in there
[1:38:24] because he knew the trouble they'd faced
[1:38:25] he knew the hardship they had faced
[1:38:27] but yet in spite of that he knew that
[1:38:30] that end up without end up
[1:38:32] hallelujah just now now what are we our
[1:38:34] position in the word is that we
[1:38:35] are we are the word made manifest we are
[1:38:39] prophecy fulfilled remember god
[1:38:41] interprets his word by bringing
[1:38:43] it to pass amen where where
[1:38:46] you know isaiah spoke for the virgin
[1:38:48] shall conceive
[1:38:49] right and no doubt everyone in israel
[1:38:52] that believed isaiah was a prophet would
[1:38:53] say well how's that going to happen
[1:38:55] and they'll try and work it out but when
[1:38:58] mary received the visitation of the
[1:39:00] angel
[1:39:00] and she said and she said let it be unto
[1:39:02] me according to thy word
[1:39:04] did there was no debate it was
[1:39:07] interpreted
[1:39:08] right because it was fulfilled amen and
[1:39:11] now here we are
[1:39:12] god has called us out who's been called
[1:39:15] who's been called
[1:39:17] who's received faith to believe what
[1:39:18] jesus did on calvary
[1:39:20] who's been washed the things you once
[1:39:23] said you can't do because your nature's
[1:39:24] been changed
[1:39:25] right who's been given an overcoming
[1:39:27] life
[1:39:28] you know the bible says in mark 16 and
[1:39:30] my name thou shall cast out devils
[1:39:32] well there to come a time where you cast
[1:39:34] the devil out of your own life
[1:39:35] where he once led you but you said satan
[1:39:38] get away in the name of jesus christ i
[1:39:39] accept the cross and there's a change in
[1:39:41] your life what happened you just
[1:39:43] dethroned the devil out of your own life
[1:39:45] i mean and god came in how there's the
[1:39:47] supernatural work
[1:39:48] [Applause]
[1:39:49] hallelujah so who's been
[1:39:53] saved who's been sealed by the holy
[1:39:55] ghost
[1:39:58] remember god has his mind i'm gonna have
[1:40:00] a bride without spite or wrinkle or any
[1:40:02] such thing
[1:40:03] amen when you're on brother bram said
[1:40:05] she'll be born of his bone life is life
[1:40:07] flesh is flesh she is him
[1:40:10] amen shares him in feminine form
[1:40:11] hallelujah upon the earth
[1:40:14] when god was speaking those things it
[1:40:16] wasn't just to excite people
[1:40:18] god was announcing this is how she will
[1:40:20] be she and the bridegroom will become
[1:40:23] one
[1:40:25] hallelujah you know when jesus was
[1:40:28] jesus was was having the last supper
[1:40:30] with his disciples
[1:40:32] and he would pick up the pick up the cup
[1:40:35] which
[1:40:35] would not be this at all i'm just using
[1:40:37] it illustrator he said
[1:40:38] this is the new testament in my blood
[1:40:41] drink this as off as you remember me
[1:40:44] so in him was the new testament
[1:40:48] in him because he is he he was the whole
[1:40:50] word made flesh
[1:40:52] so in him was this
[1:40:55] more than ink on paper now but i'm just
[1:40:57] using it as an example
[1:40:59] in him was the gospels
[1:41:02] in him was the apostles coming to their
[1:41:04] position
[1:41:05] in in in him you could say was timothy
[1:41:10] right in him was the apostle paul's
[1:41:12] ministry
[1:41:13] in him was john receiving amen
[1:41:17] the book of revelation in him was the
[1:41:19] seven church age messengers
[1:41:21] men because they're the word right they
[1:41:23] are fulfillment of the word
[1:41:25] because it's very easy for us to you
[1:41:27] know go through the book of revelation
[1:41:28] and say well
[1:41:29] the first messenger was paul because
[1:41:32] it's history it's easy to look back and
[1:41:33] say
[1:41:34] of course he fulfilled that because
[1:41:35] brother brown's criteria was
[1:41:37] the ministry that was the most would
[1:41:39] that brought people back to the word the
[1:41:40] most it was the most spirit-filled
[1:41:42] that was the one that influenced the age
[1:41:44] the most that was the church age
[1:41:46] messenger
[1:41:47] so it's very easy to go of course it was
[1:41:49] irenaeus of course you know of course it
[1:41:50] was martin of course it was columba
[1:41:52] of course it was luther of course it was
[1:41:54] wesley
[1:41:56] and you know it's very because it's
[1:41:58] history of course it was brother bram
[1:41:59] you
[1:42:00] even read church history says that he
[1:42:02] initiated his ministry initiated the
[1:42:04] post-world war
[1:42:05] ii healing revival it's easy to
[1:42:08] god's history but remember all that when
[1:42:10] he said this
[1:42:12] is the new testament in my blood because
[1:42:14] they were the fulfillment
[1:42:16] they were in him they had to be
[1:42:18] expressed
[1:42:20] and so it's very easy now to say oh of
[1:42:22] course it's them
[1:42:24] but then we would look at that and say
[1:42:25] well this is the f
[1:42:27] but many times the fulfillment and what
[1:42:30] we think the fulfillment should be
[1:42:32] doesn't reconcile you take you take
[1:42:35] martin luther for a second
[1:42:37] he smoke smoke a pipe drank beer
[1:42:41] you know didn't believe that the jews
[1:42:42] were god's chosen people but yet he was
[1:42:44] the church messenger
[1:42:46] because that was god beginning to
[1:42:48] restore that little bit of truth came
[1:42:49] forth the just shall live by faith
[1:42:52] right so we say how could this reconcile
[1:42:55] it did
[1:42:56] because that was god's fulfillment you
[1:42:58] follow me
[1:42:59] and then now now let's just jump way up
[1:43:01] to where we are
[1:43:03] she'll be bone of his bone life of his
[1:43:05] life flesh of his flesh
[1:43:07] and and we're actually not saying when
[1:43:10] are these people going to turn up
[1:43:12] they're here are you following me
[1:43:15] they're here well who are they
[1:43:18] yes hello good morning hello good
[1:43:21] morning mrs jesus christ how are we
[1:43:23] today
[1:43:25] but the fulfillment and the reality
[1:43:28] i mean sorry the fulfillment and what we
[1:43:30] think the fulfillment should be
[1:43:31] many times it's like this pole or
[1:43:33] opposite
[1:43:35] but god called you right
[1:43:38] the reason you've responded to him in
[1:43:40] this day
[1:43:41] is proof to me that you're part of this
[1:43:44] word
[1:43:46] right it's not actually oh are these
[1:43:48] people gonna match it no no god ordains
[1:43:50] the people that will fulfill his word
[1:43:52] hallelujah amen amen so so we have to
[1:43:56] actually look and say hold on
[1:43:57] okay let's just stop here how can you
[1:44:00] say the bride has been called
[1:44:02] it's very simple jesus says when you see
[1:44:05] the fig tree put forth its buds and all
[1:44:07] the trees
[1:44:09] you know that the summer is knifing at
[1:44:10] the door so the millennium is going to
[1:44:11] be here
[1:44:13] israel's been in the nation how long
[1:44:14] class could do some quick math anyone
[1:44:17] this is the interactive part of the
[1:44:18] service
[1:44:20] i don't have the answer in front of me
[1:44:21] you could say anything
[1:44:23] about 70 years 1948 they became a nation
[1:44:26] okay so that generation that sees them
[1:44:29] become a nation
[1:44:31] shall not pass until all things be
[1:44:34] fulfilled
[1:44:36] okay we see sin how it is we see all
[1:44:38] that god we see the tears come to their
[1:44:40] maturity
[1:44:42] but remember what about the wheat now
[1:44:45] it's not just them coming mature and
[1:44:46] we're still on the ground trying to put
[1:44:48] our heads up a bit you know try and grow
[1:44:49] but no no no
[1:44:50] they both grow together
[1:44:53] hallelujah so based on that i can say
[1:44:56] she is here
[1:44:58] right there's a people upon the earth
[1:45:00] that are bone of his bone life is
[1:45:02] life fleshless she is him she is the
[1:45:04] word made flesh
[1:45:06] not she will be she is amen we have to
[1:45:10] you know sometimes we've got to really
[1:45:12] take stock lord you called me
[1:45:15] you've saved me you put something in my
[1:45:17] heart to respond to the call
[1:45:19] i see you changing my life as i walk
[1:45:21] with you
[1:45:22] hallelujah and then and then what was
[1:45:24] the purpose of the call the purpose of
[1:45:26] the call isn't that we'd go into a
[1:45:27] tribulation
[1:45:28] we're not preppers right

[1:45:48] oil in their lamps you know they were
[1:45:50] waiting though already
[1:45:51] they're under expectation they were
[1:45:54] prepping for the right thing
[1:45:56] they are preparing to leave this world
[1:45:59] i mean the treasures were in heaven
[1:46:00] where the bridegroom was they are
[1:46:02] waiting
[1:46:03] for his call and they are ready as soon
[1:46:05] as the call said behold behold the
[1:46:07] bridegroom comes
[1:46:10] i've got oil i'm ready
[1:46:13] hallelujah
[1:46:16] these ones not so much we don't want to
[1:46:19] be in that category of people
[1:46:21] we want to be in this category of people
[1:46:24] hallelujah should be a burning desire
[1:46:26] lord
[1:46:28] i want oil i want the holy ghost of my
[1:46:30] life
[1:46:32] amen so but we're not prepping to stay

[1:46:58] long game
[1:46:59] but play the short game too what does
[1:47:01] that mean play a long game like it might
[1:47:03] be the next generation god comes

[1:47:13] amen so she is bone of his bone life is
[1:47:17] life flesh of his flesh she is him

[1:47:55] hallelujah don't you just want to see
[1:47:56] his will fulfilled in your life
[1:47:58] amen now let's just let's just jump
[1:48:00] through this okay i might have to
[1:48:06] skip a few of this now it's amazing when
[1:48:10] brother brown speaks of
[1:48:13] we'll come to this another time
[1:48:17] he speaks about abraham here and
[1:48:20] this isn't the greatest bad i've ever
[1:48:22] fought he says abraham said get your
[1:48:24] bonnets and everything together we're
[1:48:25] taking
[1:48:26] off to the land where are you going i
[1:48:28] don't know
[1:48:29] amen but we're going anyhow here we go
[1:48:32] packed up and going hallelujah
[1:48:34] that's the real word of god what was he
[1:48:36] holding in front of him the promise of
[1:48:38] god the word of god we're going to have
[1:48:40] it
[1:48:40] amen amen and and that should be how we
[1:48:43] should be
[1:48:44] we're going to have it amen we're
[1:48:45] anointed to win amen

[1:48:48] battle but we're anointed to win
[1:48:50] we're not anointed to lose amen we're
[1:48:52] anointed to win hallelujah
[1:48:54] amen so abraham had that kind of faith
[1:48:56] he says now come out from amongst your
[1:48:58] people abraham
[1:48:59] they're the thing uh of it is their
[1:49:02] doubters and unbelievers and they'll
[1:49:03] have you in the same fix come out
[1:49:05] come on out separate yourself and live
[1:49:06] for me what is it now
[1:49:08] many times and and maybe i should have
[1:49:10] put this together in a more clever way
[1:49:12] but it's
[1:49:12] i i can't read spanish i can't divvy it
[1:49:14] out but you know
[1:49:15] many times when people hear this kind of
[1:49:17] thing separate your people
[1:49:18] you separate yourself they think i've
[1:49:20] got to separate from all my worldly
[1:49:22] associates
[1:49:24] all of those unbelievers and doubters
[1:49:26] but he's not saying that here
[1:49:27] he says leave all of your conscience yes
[1:49:30] and senses behind like that right open
[1:49:34] up your mind and remember it's me
[1:49:36] come live with me i mean so so

[1:49:45] memories all the pain all the hurt let's
[1:49:47] go beyond those things today
[1:49:49] let's go beyond the hurt let's go beyond

[1:49:55] moving forward

[1:49:58] things separate yourself from your
[1:49:59] disappointments
[1:50:01] hallelujah amen hearing disappointments
[1:50:05] we so
[1:50:06] often sadly roam do we not sing that and
[1:50:08] everyone rejoices in praise of the lord
[1:50:10] and glory i love that song because we're
[1:50:12] looking for a city
[1:50:12] but hearing disappointments we so often
[1:50:15] sadly rome
[1:50:17] it's all part of the walk remember god
[1:50:20] just doesn't put us through a channel
[1:50:21] and just push us through and we're good
[1:50:24] amen but he will keep his people amen
[1:50:27] he says god's calling every seed of
[1:50:30] abraham
[1:50:30] this morning to that same kind of a life
[1:50:34] great battles are now worldwide god
[1:50:36] wants us children separating themselves
[1:50:38] from what
[1:50:39] see taste feel smell here imaginations
[1:50:42] conscience memories reasons affections
[1:50:44] everything
[1:50:45] open up their mind that every word come
[1:50:47] in and march
[1:50:48] with that with the word that's a real
[1:50:51] soldier
[1:50:53] this is the great battle well my mind
[1:50:55] tells me one thing but what does god's
[1:50:57] word tell me
[1:50:58] my feelings say one thing you know many
[1:51:02] well why don't people go want to go
[1:51:04] beyond their
[1:51:05] comfort zone because they feel
[1:51:06] uncomfortable
[1:51:08] and they let that uncomfortable feeling
[1:51:10] override maybe they know they've got to
[1:51:12] do it
[1:51:12] but they don't do it i've got to do it
[1:51:14] but i feel uncomfortable we're going to
[1:51:15] push past it
[1:51:18] amen you know so he says separate from
[1:51:21] all those things
[1:51:23] open up their mind that every word come
[1:51:24] in and march with the word that's a real
[1:51:27] soldier amen that's what we're called to
[1:51:31] that's what we're called to be in this
[1:51:32] hour take god's word first
[1:51:35] above our feelings amen above our
[1:51:37] emotions above our memory
[1:51:39] above our conscience whatever it may be
[1:51:42] our imaginations let's lay that remember
[1:51:46] the apostle paul said cast down
[1:51:47] reasoning well what's the reasoning we
[1:51:50] should cast down
[1:51:51] is the word true or not is the word for
[1:51:53] me or not
[1:51:55] that's the reasoning isn't it really
[1:51:57] it's not reasoning about
[1:51:58] moral things or whatever no it's
[1:52:00] reasoning is it is the word true
[1:52:02] yeah it's easy to say it's true but what
[1:52:04] about is it for me
[1:52:06] oh boy that's when reason can really
[1:52:08] come in am i worthy to receive this
[1:52:09] promise yes
[1:52:11] what do you mean of course i'm worthy he
[1:52:14] died for me that i'd receive it amen
[1:52:16] amen hallelujah
[1:52:22] we don't want to this is the life we we
[1:52:25] we really want to walk in and if he says
[1:52:28] if every
[1:52:29] if he says that god is calling every
[1:52:31] seed of abraham this morning to
[1:52:32] for that same kind of a life this is
[1:52:35] what the wise will walk like
[1:52:37] yes oh can i do it of course you can do
[1:52:40] it
[1:52:41] amen what what do you mean he will
[1:52:44] enable us
[1:52:45] he has enabled us to do it amen remember
[1:52:49] god doesn't say
[1:52:50] go on a rapture and then just leave you
[1:52:51] to work it out right you know this is
[1:52:53] not trying to get to the moon in our own
[1:52:55] ability
[1:52:55] we call specialists together we build
[1:52:57] prototypes and whatever
[1:52:59] no no god just says i'm going to give
[1:53:00] you astronaut faith i'm going to give
[1:53:02] you a power to go through the
[1:53:03] stratosphere into another realm
[1:53:05] hallelujah i'm going to equip you that
[1:53:06] way hallelujah
[1:53:08] and so you know if god says this is how
[1:53:11] you got to be i'd say amen yes lord
[1:53:12] amen yes lord amen hallelujah
[1:53:18] amen
[1:53:23] amen sees us here
[1:53:27] maybe we'll stop see the new birth as a
[1:53:30] as christ as a revelation as christ
[1:53:31] mystery god revealed
[1:53:33] god has revealed to you this great
[1:53:34] mystery and that's a new birth
[1:53:36] that's what and what are you going to do
[1:53:38] when you get all that group together
[1:53:41] where revelation is perfectly in harmony
[1:53:43] and god expressing it through his word
[1:53:45] by the same actions
[1:53:46] the same things that he did making the
[1:53:48] word manifest
[1:53:50] now a lot of people take this and say
[1:53:52] now we've got to get all the doctrine
[1:53:53] straightened out
[1:53:55] and we've got to have some right humanly
[1:53:57] speaking
[1:53:59] god will get the doctrine straightened
[1:54:00] out right as we walk with him
[1:54:03] but what is the revelation i mean that
[1:54:05] that that he is also talking about here
[1:54:08] right that christ has revealed himself
[1:54:10] personally to a person
[1:54:12] right are you with me harley says now
[1:54:15] what are you going to do when that
[1:54:16] revelation where the revelation is
[1:54:17] perfectly
[1:54:18] in harmony amen and god is expressing it
[1:54:22] through his word by the same actions
[1:54:25] you know we know the truth is if we
[1:54:26] really have the holy ghost when the
[1:54:28] correct doctrine comes away we'll accept
[1:54:29] it
[1:54:31] amen why because the mind of christ is
[1:54:33] in us hallelujah so it won't be a battle
[1:54:35] and we'll be able to lay aside
[1:54:37] you know scarecrows are the biggest
[1:54:38] problem
[1:54:40] but scarecrows are there because there's
[1:54:43] food
[1:54:44] right you don't put just say if i had a
[1:54:46] veggie garden i'm not gonna put a
[1:54:48] scarecrow by my litter box
[1:54:50] where there's nothing growing to keep
[1:54:52] the whatever's away from you know
[1:54:54] because all of my food is up you know
[1:54:56] i'm going to put a scarecrow where the
[1:54:58] food is
[1:55:00] you know if the bugs or whatever afraid
[1:55:01] of a scarecrow by the letterbox well
[1:55:03] they're gonna die anyway because they're
[1:55:05] dumb bugs
[1:55:06] right but you know a scarecrow is where
[1:55:08] food is yes
[1:55:10] so we should never be worried like i
[1:55:12] should be able to say
[1:55:13] thunders i should be able to speak about
[1:55:15] perugia
[1:55:17] right i should be able to speak about
[1:55:18] son of man ministry some of you look at
[1:55:20] me like what are you talking about
[1:55:21] because you
[1:55:22] haven't lived through those days right i
[1:55:25] should be able to talk about the seals
[1:55:26] open the books open the mighty angels
[1:55:28] here
[1:55:28] you know anything that oh that's
[1:55:29] controversial oh you know
[1:55:32] the lord's going to ride a trail i'll
[1:55:33] ride this trail again
[1:55:35] return ministry what is return ministry
[1:55:37] the holy ghost returning in his people
[1:55:39] it's not brother brown coming back and
[1:55:41] returning right so but we should be able
[1:55:42] to speak about these things
[1:55:44] doesn't matter what everyone else has
[1:55:46] done with it
[1:55:48] i mean what god allows scarecrows to
[1:55:51] rise up and people to fail
[1:55:53] because it's the genuineness of our
[1:55:55] faith will be tried
[1:55:57] right church splits god allows it to
[1:55:59] happen
[1:56:00] god allows conflict between ministries
[1:56:02] god allows laity to have fights all
[1:56:04] these different things why
[1:56:05] it's because the genuineness of our
[1:56:07] faith would be tried
[1:56:09] is our faith a genuine faith in him or
[1:56:12] is our faith in while everyone else is
[1:56:13] going in it's exciting
[1:56:16] right that's the challenge see so but if
[1:56:18] we have the mind of christ
[1:56:19] it doesn't matter what everyone's doing
[1:56:21] let them do it
[1:56:23] i said god help them yeah god help us as
[1:56:25] well but you know
[1:56:26] let's just walk with the lord abraham
[1:56:29] had to walk with god
[1:56:31] he had a burden why are you going this
[1:56:33] way but god called abraham
[1:56:35] god brought a lot out before the burning
[1:56:38] yes
[1:56:38] so i'm not diminishing lot right but
[1:56:41] we've got to walk with god alone
[1:56:44] it's me and jesus i'm going all the way
[1:56:47] hallelujah that's how we're all going to
[1:56:48] be you know
[1:56:50] our walk with god is not based on
[1:56:52] shekinah tabernacle
[1:56:54] we don't have a relationship with jesus
[1:56:55] christ through this this thing
[1:56:58] it's got to be individual i mean that
[1:57:01] that if there's no more church there's
[1:57:03] no more whatever
[1:57:04] we still walk with him but god allows
[1:57:07] all those things that the genuineness of
[1:57:09] our faith would be tried is it genuine
[1:57:11] faith
[1:57:12] or is it mixed with humanity and this is
[1:57:14] what the group's doing this is what
[1:57:15] these ones do
[1:57:16] or is actually i'm walking with him
[1:57:20] amen oh if the church
[1:57:23] only knew its position it will one day
[1:57:26] then the rapture will go
[1:57:28] when pardon me it knows what it is
[1:57:31] yes and that's why i was speaking before
[1:57:33] about jesus said
[1:57:36] this is the new testament in my blood
[1:57:39] do this is off as you remember me he's
[1:57:42] saying actually
[1:57:43] it's in me it's just got to be expressed
[1:57:46] upon the earth what are we today now
[1:57:49] this is not this shouldn't be some
[1:57:51] abstract idea that's just exciting you
[1:57:53] should have you see no no
[1:57:54] i've been called abraham was just like
[1:57:57] any other man
[1:57:58] i'm gonna quit with this he's just like
[1:58:00] any other man
[1:58:01] but god spoke to him amen and he just
[1:58:04] began to walk with god
[1:58:06] and then he found himself in this land
[1:58:09] right and then god said i'm going to
[1:58:10] give you a son he found himself he had
[1:58:13] the son
[1:58:15] who who gave him the son god gave him
[1:58:17] the son
[1:58:18] and then when god said okay take that
[1:58:19] son and gonna sacrifice him well
[1:58:21] abraham said well i received his as one
[1:58:23] from the dead so god can raise him up
[1:58:25] again
[1:58:26] and then he found himself so it was just
[1:58:29] because of a supernatural call
[1:58:32] and then he found himself burying his
[1:58:33] wife sarah in a cave
[1:58:36] that he bought in a
[1:58:39] in that place he just found himself
[1:58:41] doing these things
[1:58:43] and then sarah's buried there then
[1:58:44] eventually abraham's buried there
[1:58:48] just found himself living this life
[1:58:51] and when he passed from this world to
[1:58:52] the next world
[1:58:54] he just happened to find himself in
[1:58:57] paradise
[1:59:00] he just all because of a call see see
[1:59:02] many times you know we look at what god
[1:59:04] has done in the scripture and we think
[1:59:06] that's
[1:59:06] incredible and it's incredible but he
[1:59:09] will believe as though just living up
[1:59:10] their everyday life
[1:59:12] abraham had his good harvest he had his
[1:59:15] bad harvest he had
[1:59:16] trouble and whatever more and strife and
[1:59:18] trouble in the family all these things
[1:59:20] but god called abraham right and he just
[1:59:23] found himself walking with god
[1:59:24] and then he found himself in paradise
[1:59:27] hallelujah and then adam and eve and all
[1:59:29] the redeemed came and embraced them and
[1:59:30] they rejoiced and
[1:59:32] you know but it was just and then
[1:59:34] finally here they are
[1:59:35] and then more of the redeemed come
[1:59:36] through and then isaac came through
[1:59:38] hallelujah and isaac would tell abraham
[1:59:41] about his journey with the lord
[1:59:42] and you know jacob and all the different
[1:59:44] ones and david they came through
[1:59:46] and then eventually the thief on the
[1:59:47] cross came through
[1:59:49] how long was your earthly journey with
[1:59:51] the lord about five minutes
[1:59:55] god ordained i know i've said it before
[1:59:57] but god ordained him for that five
[1:59:58] minutes
[2:00:00] right it's not about oh i wish he you
[2:00:02] know sure we all wish we
[2:00:03] we you know we met him earlier but god
[2:00:06] ordained him to know the lord
[2:00:08] five minutes that was the part of the
[2:00:11] word he had to fulfill
[2:00:12] glory right there had to be a thief that
[2:00:15] was pardoned and a thief
[2:00:16] not pardoned just like the butler and
[2:00:18] the baker there in joseph's prison that
[2:00:20] had to be fulfilled in reality
[2:00:22] hallelujah so now they're all in
[2:00:24] paradise
[2:00:25] and then finally you know they're
[2:00:26] rejoicing and then finally the one that
[2:00:28] they were waiting for
[2:00:31] walks through the door and then
[2:00:34] he says come on boys we're going up
[2:00:36] higher yeah i'm just i'm just
[2:00:38] giving a very brief overview and they
[2:00:40] ascend up on high into the great city
[2:00:43] and if you asked abraham abraham why are
[2:00:45] you in that city
[2:00:47] because he called me down there amen and
[2:00:50] something in me said
[2:00:51] that's god the world was full of
[2:00:54] religion in that day too
[2:00:56] but something in him said that's the one
[2:00:58] who made this
[2:01:00] made all things something in him said i
[2:01:03] can serve a god like that
[2:01:04] hallelujah and he just found himself
[2:01:06] walking amen
[2:01:08] and then he ends up in glory and here we
[2:01:11] are
[2:01:11] amen and god called us yes did god
[2:01:15] has he called you does he become real
[2:01:19] he called you for a reason he doesn't
[2:01:21] lead you just down some garden path and
[2:01:23] whatever more and just down to a dead
[2:01:25] end no no
[2:01:26] he leads you into a new body
[2:01:30] hallelujah why are you saying all this
[2:01:39] we'll get there suspense i planned it
[2:01:48] why are you saying all this because
[2:01:52] it keeps us in
[2:01:55] perspective it keeps everything in
[2:01:58] perspective
[2:01:59] right it doesn't matter about what
[2:02:01] happens in life
[2:02:03] i didn't get into it but it says in
[2:02:04] daniel here that the that
[2:02:06] that michael will stand up that great
[2:02:08] prince you stand up for the children of
[2:02:09] the people
[2:02:10] so there's now daniel is told michael
[2:02:13] the great prince is going to stand up

[2:02:21] heaven and we're going to look after the
[2:02:23] children of thy people

[2:02:26] of jesus christ i mean we are the most
[2:02:28] looked after people
[2:02:29] i mean in the whole of existence we are
[2:02:31] never out of his care
