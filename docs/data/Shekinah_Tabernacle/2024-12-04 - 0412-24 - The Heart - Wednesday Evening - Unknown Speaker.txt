that you desire so much to fellowship with us and to speak to our hearts this evening lord it's such a humbling thing for us but yet we receive it Lord because you said come Lord so we just commit this um uh this night to you in jesus' name amen amen amen praise the Lord God bless you all this evening it's good to be um here as while you're standing let's just um go to um Ephesians 3:17 we'll just open with the scripture then you can have your seats thank you musicians thank you for the songs I feel a nice atmosphere uh here tonight amen Ephesians 3:17 that Christ May dwell in your hearts richly by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may God bless his word you can um take your seats this evening do we have any tissues up here brother kumin I don't know what's happening to me I'm being serious I don't know what's happening but the Lord's doing something and and and he he's either going to let this thing that's been this enemy that's been at me for about 15 years totally defeat me or he's going to totally defeat it because there's something going on man it's unreal but you know yeah and sometimes overwhelming you know Shannon was just I didn't get a chance to listen to the message that brother Ben put on this week yet but Shannon listened to it and she said oh this is you should listen to this this is exactly for you and she was just as I was getting this ready this afternoon she was she just kind of preached to me recap the sermon and I I don't know man there was something about it just tears were streaming down my face as she was just saying these things and you know God's God's always doing something in your life even if it seems like he's it's quiet he's always doing something he's always planning something he's never just he never just forgets about you and thinks oh whoops that's right brother imp's there oh I forgot about him and he was going through that and oh man and I should have started this process years earlier because now I'm behind in it and I I was supposed to have something in place there by the time you met that person and here and there he's never like that he's always perfectly on time he's always got it all together amen that's the god that we serve um and I appreciated the songs this evening they were the opening one was um come now is the time to worship come now is the time to give your heart and the other one was um Lord I give you my heart and so my the the the word that I want to speak on tonight is heart last time I checked we've all got a heart do you have a heart it's good because you wouldn't be here if you're not the heart and and you know as Christians we're not going to talk about our natural heart although it's vitally important for us to sort of connect to this earth here but I want to talk about our spiritual heart and uh the Greek word apparently is cardus is that similar to like cardiac arist or something is it you know we think we're so smart us humans and US English people use all these Greek words to name our things you know and we call all the parts in our body a different or Latin or something you know it's like come on man say English if you're English say English but we like to show we're intelligent um but it's um it's the thoughts or the feelings and it's also the middle it's like your thoughts your feelings and everything kind of all put together is what we're going to call your heart so you've got this thing somewhere in you that's called your heart and it's it's the center of you it's it's everything that you are and it's it's it's all your thoughts it's all your feelings it's your emotions it's your it's it's it's basically everything that's you housed in this little place called your heart and I want to just take you through a few things about the heart and the first thing is is that the heart is actually a big big big place it's not a small place the heart's a very big place your heart's a very big place maybe there are places in your heart that You' never been to before your own heart brother Colin maybe places in his heart he's never been that's how big his heart is you could probably search your heart your whole life and never never quite find everywhere that's in it so the heart is a very very big place and as the Bible says here they search out iniquities they accomplish a diligent search both the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deep or here's another scripture to make it a little bit um different more understandable they devis acts of Justice saying we are ready with the well-conceived plan for the inward thought and the heart of man are deep mysterious and unsearchable that's what lies in your heart an unsearchable place okay now but unfortunately as would be the fact that we are born in sin the unfortunate thing about this place is that it says the heart is deceitful above of all things and desperately wicked who can know it it's a because we're born in sin we're shapen in iniquity and we we came this way then this this heart that we've got has the ability to be such an evil place and and it by default is an evil place when we're born a heart is just evil and maybe when we're small only small evil things come out like we steal a cookie you know about some of those people that stole a cookie end up killing Millions cuz the heart can be in such an evil place and and and that the the heart is the reason why it's so evil is because it's it's just born evil but it's also got the ability for spirits to come and manifest themselves inside this place we call the heart but it's not all evil but I'm saying that the evil these evil things can't really go into this water here and make and express itself but it's got the ability to come into us and express itself it's the heart can be deceived it can be manipulated all these things can happen in the human heart to make the human heart can start to think good is evil and evil is good it can be manipulated the human heart it's a very interesting place the things that go on in the human heart a and and and this scripture here is about when Jesus was going to be um sold to the Pharisees and Judas was going to betray him it says that he said Jesus said whoever takes a so and eats it he'll be the one and and Judas did it and then it said as soon as he'd finished that then it said Satan entered into him went into his heart and Jesus said unto him that thou do us do quickly so this heart's got the ability that can it can be so evil if if we so let it and yet there's another scripture here that says the opposite that says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love so the heart has also got the ility to invite the spirit of God in and God could come down into our heart into this place we call the heart and begin to do a fantastic work in our hearts and on that note we understand then that God has this great being that fills all time and space that actually has an interest in the human heart it's one of his most interesting places to go is down into the human heart it's actually his most interesting place of all the places on the whole the Earth he doesn't go up in the hills somewhere he doesn't go there he goes into the human heart and he loves to search out the the human heart to go he's got a torch and he he walks down in there and he searches around in the human heart to see what's in there it says I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year God is searching every single heart daily searching the heart can you imagine how wonderful he feels when he sees a good heart he feels so happy wow look what's here I believe I'll stay that's why David said search me oh God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts Lord come and search me imagine God's even invited Lord then search me if you're the great Searcher search me bring your big Spotlight of the word of God and search my heart search my spirit search my motive search my intention search everything that I Am Lord search me it's such a wonderful thing the Lord and you know life's experiences and all your assessments of them and everything that they are all get housed down inside your heart every single thing every thought everything that came to you everything that went from you everything every place you existed in every emotion you felt everything you heard that's right everything you thought everything you remembered everything you said everything it's all just housed in this place called the human heart it's this fantastic place but everything that you are how's there and I want to say this the heart is actually a it's a dynamic place that actually gives and receives it doesn't just sit stagnant and not do anything it things come in and things go out it it it moves it's alive this hard things happen in it that's cuz the if the Lord said Thou shalt love the Lord God with all your heart if something can come out of your heart then something can come back into it if love can go out then love can come back in if Joy can can go out joy can come back in if hope can go out then hope can come back in it's a dynamic place it doesn't just sit there stagnant like a stagnant pool that just sits there to rot it's Dynamic and unfortunately at the same time that that if if someone lets it there can be Evil coming out but we can praise God we're right into that and another fantastic thing on this Bas is that it's so Dynamic that it can be renewed the human heart can be renewed if it's if it's old and run down it can be renewed it can be changed God's Got ability to come in hearts and change them to to come into this place with this torch and figure out what needs to be done and change it for the better that's what God can do in the human heart he's such a wonderful God and he says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit I will put within you and I'll take you out the Stony heart of your flesh and I'll give uh Stone your heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh I'll change your heart you realize we can't even change our own Hearts we don't have the ability to come in and change it we didn't even know where it is we can't even find our heart where is where's my heart where does it lay can I go there but you can't God go there search me find me Lord sa if there be some Wicked way of me Lord and he can change it all for the better if we don't let him he says to give to appoint unto them in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes if he's these ashes there he can make Beauty there if he sees mourning if he sees a heart to in mourning he's got the ability to make it joyful to give it the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness if someone's heavy he can change it to praise that spirit that can weigh down our heart to make your heart so heavy to to almost pull down your whole being that to just drag you down he can put that off you he can strive that thing away and give you the the Garment of Praise that's the god that we serve this morning and that's uh this evening that's why David said Lord create in me a Clean Heart Lord do this to me give me give me the oil of Joy oh God for the spirit of heaviness Lord God that's the god that we serve this evening the god that can change our hearts that can renew us that can make us a new hallelujah praise the Lord and then and then we have this fantastic ability we're in possession of this heart we've got this fantastic ability that we can take all of that heart that we know cuz we don't know how big it is we can take whatever it is and say Lord here can you have this Lord here's my heart isn't there a song Here's My Heart Lord we can say Lord take my heart Lord put it in your hands God take my heart and then what does God say he says cast all your cares upon me for I care for you give me your heart and I'll care for you I'll make sure it doesn't get run down and ruined I'll care for you give me that heart I'll care for it I'll love it I'll look after it Hallelujah that's the god that we serve he doesn't he doesn't just get it and throw it aside somewhere who cherishes it cares for it that's the god that we serve and when we get into places like like what David said he said from the end of the Earth will I Cry when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the Rock that's higher than I oh God when I'm overwhelmed when I just feel like I can't go on Lord care for me Lord lead me to the Rock that's higher than I what a God that we serve and yet and yet through all that we actually realize that you know see it seems like well it's this bit complicated thing you know it sounds quite complicated you know but really that the way that life is though it's actually quite simple you know we God's made it that things can be so complex but so simple at the same time it's the heart's actually very simple you just are your heart that's where he says as water reflects as water as in water face reflects face so a man's heart reveals a man saying he's basically saying if you look at a guy you look at his heart that's how simple it is you want to see his heart that's in there if he's happy his heart's happy if he's down his heart's down if he's angry his heart's angry that's simple you just look at it and that's it it's not it's nothing mysterious at oh he was like that but then his heart's really over there somewhere no it's what it is what it is that's him does that make sense now now as a result of that that that every day then we deal directly with human hearts that's actually what we deal with and and and whether you're rich poor whatever you are it doesn't matter you got the heart the same as everyone else and people deal with your heart the same as everyone else it's you understand what I'm trying to say is it and and the thing about this human heart is that they they respond best to to to love to care to to compassion understanding encouragement this heart will respond if you if you deal with a human heart like that it'll respond it'll give you you'll get a favorable response there'll be something in their heart that goes wow what's this I like this and you deal directly with human hearts every single day when you shake someone's head when you talk to them you're dealing directly with this thing that's called their heart and you're part of that Dynamic of their heart of this going in and coming out you're part of the sewing into their heart for that day when you see them when brother Aman say someone's awesome that goes into their heart and they think I'm awesome and you do a good thing and it's good to if you know Hearts it's good to encourage people I'm saying that because you we should encourage Hearts like there was a forgive me H but there was a guy that was going to be shf uh he wanted to cook pizzas at the at the cafe and um I met him once and I really liked this guy I thought man this is a neat guy he's just a really he's got something in him he's real I liked him he's I I I saw his heart he's a neat guy this guy and and he really wanted to work there but he was a bit despondent cuz he hadn't had a job for so long he was a bit down on himself but I kind of realized he wants to give it his best shot and he wants to make it work and he and he wants to achieve this thing but I didn't really get a chance to have much to do with as he was being trained in the first few weeks so I kind of uh wasn't really a part of his uh Early Times there and I was there for maybe one or two times but he he started to go uh the people started going a bit negative on him started say man this guy's actually no good he ain't going to make it you know you started to have to talk more more and more this guy ah he's going all he was bit funny tonight getting a bit angry and he was just going downhill this and sort of when people start talking like that that means they want to get rid of this guy like you know he's and the the chatter gets louder and louder and louder till you kind of have to go oh well goodbye but I thought no no no I know that guy I only met him twice but I know that guy I know his heart I thought to myself you the problem here is you're not you're not dealing with this man's heart in his heart he wants to you got to get to his heart and he'll be fine he'll be fine so I said leave him with me for a couple of nights man I've got this guy I got him and I dealt with his heart you're awesome bro you got it man look at that cool good you made a mistake don't worry about it don't worry ah we all do man I make mistakes all the time you should have seen me when I started who I'm burning everything don't worry about it and over Day Day and day after this day after that day after the day of doing this this man started to feel good again he just started to get better and better and better until now he's he's he's topnotch why because you got to deal with somebody's heart deal with their heart don't just not realize their heart is there deal with their heart and wonders in your life if you got children friends anyone deal with their heart and love them like give them a genuine love and it will change them and will change how they view you they'll love you even someone that hates you will love you when a man's ways please the Lord even his enemies will be at peace with him I want to say this you can you can also if you don't watch it we like to encourage other people you can also discourage your own heart anyone ever done that I'm no good you're discouraging your own heart because the Bible says as a man thinks in his heart so is he so if you think you're no good then it technically you are no good because whatever you think is what you are and and and it's such a disappointing place to get to where you just speak down to your heart you just discourage your own heart I don't think Jesus would come along and tell you you're no good so why do you tell yourself you're no good who's telling that who's saying that like if you wanted to play an instrument but someone always told you I'm no good I'll never do it chances are you'll never do it because you are what you think I'm telling you that because it's you you cannot discourage your own heart I know sometimes it's hard when you get down about something you think man I'm such an idiot I'm just no good I'm never going to amount to nothing but don't listen to that please man don't discourage your own heart David showed an example when when he left Zig and and he went off and fought and then zigg got burnt and everything was taken and the men were going to Stone him that's right yeah amen instead of getting down about it what did David do he encouraged himself in the Lord he said in his heart it's going to be all right in his heart no wor don't worry about this David God's got you you're all right David come on man keep going go David you can do this just Rejoice move forward God will overcome he encouraged his heart he encouraged his heart and he overcame it would have been the opposite if he discouraged his heart there's a scripture that says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor but if for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow husband and wife you know have you noticed that most of the time only one's down at the same time such a good scheme you know very rarely are two down at the same time cuz then it's like man I'm on the dumps and then the other person's like I am too down you go usually one person's doing all right you know you're like man I've had a bad day you've had a what I've had a wonderful day really and you encourage each other but the Bible says here but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he ha not another to help him up and if you fall and you're alone and then you're down and then and you and you can't even lift up your own heart What a Sad hard place to be that you you can't even lift up your own heart and you're just down and and you just can't get yourself out of that oh Lord lead me to the Rock that's higher than I sometimes only it can it's only God that can go there and lift you up say it's all right and I've had that before many times I want to go through this keep this concept of the heart it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life or in other words Above All Else guard your heart for everything you do flows from it or guard your heart above all else for it determines the course of your life look after your heart look after it don't let it be a negative evil place don't let it be a down place let it be a happy place say God fill my heart with joy make make me happy Lord Make Me positive don't let it be a negative Place guard it remember you are what you think guard your heart I can sure as anything guarantee you God does not want your heart to be negative he doesn't want it to be down and negative he wants it to be positive he he wants to love you he wants you to know in your heart I'm awesome oh brother you sure I'm positive cuz if I was if he was standing right here he would tell me I'm awesome so why can't I tell myself is that right a merry heart does good like a medicine but a broken Spirit dries the bones you think God wants you to have dry bones you R Dry Bones back to life H in the valley of dry bones he's in the business of raising Dry Bones back up so why would he why would he want to have you down and be be dry bones he wants you have a Mery heart so it's you're you're just refreshing itself cuz because this this whole can I just talk a little bit about this little heart thing right here's a funny concept for you even in laughter the heart is sorrowful quite a powerful concept right have you thought about this before you can be very depressed about something very depressed and and it's heavy on you but go to a even go to church or go to a a group social Gathering where it's happy or watch a play that's happy or do something that's happy and you can laugh and genuinely laugh at that occasion or what what you're watching or what you're a part of you can laugh and genuinely laugh but in your heart you're still sad so that's why Solomon says even in in laughter the heart can be sorrowful but you know what but you know you know want to know something about it if it's the other way around you can't be sad if you're happy when you're happy you know when someone's trying to be serious and you're just so happy they're like they have to tell you hey bro can you just calm down we're supposed to be a bit serious here like what happens to admand all the time you know we're trying to be serious and he's and he's all just joking because he's so happy but he'll have to pretend now that he's that he's that right he can't genuinely be down when he's happy but you can genuinely be happy when you're down you ever thought about that that's a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken or in other words a happy heart makes the face cheerful but heartache crushes the spirit I don't believe God wants us to have heartache so if you see someone with heartache just encourage them help them it's all right bro it's all right we're good you're good man it's all right we don't want heartache in our and and amongst us we don't want sorrow we want joy I'm just going to read you this heart disease and depression often carry overlapping symptoms such as fatigue low energy and difficulty in sleeping and Carry On The Daily rhythms of Life basically what they're saying is if you've got depression you've generally get heart disease or it drags you down it they all go this natural thing that could weight us down and our spirit then affects our body which is what we read before here's one maintaining a positive attitude about treatment and holding the belief that our actions can have a beneficial effect on our own health are very important in other words they're saying uh a Mery heart does good like a medicine that's what they that's what they're saying without admitting that they want to say it a Mary heart does good like a medicine but a broken Spirit dth the bones I just want to move on now one thing that you have to always check are your intentions and the motives of your heart because they just come out and do what they do or actually sometimes they don't quite come out but that's there I really want to do this but I shouldn't I never do that but you guys do now when I do do that I say well what's that why is that there and what if I let that come out what would it achieve and it if achieved bringing someone down or making them worse off I think then what sort of spirit am off where that where does that thing come from and I can I give you a powerful very powerful analogy of that is that all right if I feel any sort of animosity to anybody here in my heart but I don't admit it but it's a little bit of animosity or something meaning that I want to bring them down just slightly like I want Josh to only play the guitar uh instead of eight times a month seven times a month cuz I'm getting a bit M he's getting he's he's a he's getting near my skill level we can't have this sounds trival but yeah and I want to I'm going to take one away from him just so we can just hold this back for a bit longer cuz I just and then I do the schedule and okay we just cross Josh out from the Wednesday now I have to be honest with myself and say where did that come from that's right cuz I've got some sort of desire in me to want to bring him down slightly let me tell you something that will shock you that spirit that does that is the tip of the iceberg that Spirit wants to absolutely kill him ma him slash him to death rip him apart and Chuck him down in the gutter and that he and gone forever that's what it wants to do it's just manifesting itself in a tiny little way the guitar that's what that spirit is that's the end of it if it had its way and some people it takes them over so much that they do that these killers they do that because the spirit can just it does that but I got the same one if I don't want them to seven instead of eight guitar plays it's exactly the same thing it's no different because it's anything that anything that comes in you that desires to pull someone else down just a little bit is from the pit of Hell and it's that spirit that wants to absolutely destroy you and everything you love hands down no question about it so if there's any sort of intention in your heart that ever does that I'll be real quick and say Lord search me where's that thing hiding where's it hiding I saw it you just saw it in the corner of your eye Lord I saw that where is it hiding Lord bring your search light and find that thing and God will search it he'll on the Sunday someone will preach the word of God and it'll go right down there it'll catch it out where it is you'll say there it is I want that gone that's the god that we serve he searches the hearts amen amen is that all right the Lord knows in my heart I don't have any ill intention for anybody ever never I I can't let it get past my thinking process to think do I want Josh absolutely Torn to Pieces and cast aside no then why would I ever think any sort of thing that would bring him down just a tiny tiny bit why would I ever let that come into my heart what spirit is that of certainly not the spirit of God I can assure you of that we want the spirit of God that loves that encourages that's compassionate that wants to build up that edifies that that is happy when someone else does better than us happy my children tell me all the time I'll be better than you soon I'm like that's so good man can you put it in writing or people at work you know that like my my mate William Will I Am you know the the chef guy he sort of jokes now I'm on the I'm on the main oven now I said yeah you are man yeah you got the job awesome man you're awesome not just here but everywhere you're awesome in your life you're good man don't don't be down don't be down on yourself plenty of people in the world are going to tell you useless Satan's got plenty of people that going to tell you you're no good tell you you can't do it tell you this and that I'm here to tell you you can I here to tell your heart you're awesome you're amazing you're You're such amazing people this evening that's who you are and that's what God thinks about you every day you wake up he get so proud he's like wo here they go that's what he thinks I'm not making this up because what does love do it wants to build up and if he's the Fountain of all love the source of all love that comes for forth then what are his thoughts going to be towards you when you wake up in the morning yes they're going to do better today oh but they failed in that St thing for years I don't care and here we go at the end of the day if it's a big failure he's so proud another day tomorrow how when will he ever say actually no I to destroy them his own yeah never he'll never think that of you never will that thing that tells you that is a liar in your heart it's a total liar it's just Satan wants to bring you down CU this whole he's in the game the business of bringing people down that's all he knows how to do to destroy to pull down but God's in the business of creating and renewing and making us amen just don't get a big kid though you think you're all good okay that was a joke is that right you know when you go on in the Lord you realize Lord if it wasn't for you I'd be nothing but then I don't let but then when the devil says I so you're nothing then I'm like no I'm not nothing no no no no no no I'm not talking to you I'm talking to the Lord when I talk to you I'm a mighty conqueror I'm a lion I'm an overcomer no weapon formed against me will prosper that's what I talk to how I talk when I talk to you I'm Victorious undefeatable oh God I'm a sinner Lord help me Lord Lord I'm unworthy Lord uh I fail every day Lord forgive me help me Lord that's how I am before the Lord but not before my enemy before my enemy I'm a mighty warrior Fearless in battle is that all you got is that all you got beat me down on the carpet is that all you got Bring It On can I just talk about this for a minute the heart of a man the seems to be that a man's heart is slightly different than a woman's heart Naturally Speaking because in a heart housed all of your emotions and your being you know and and a man has this ability now the woman's heart is fantastic but I need to talk about this because it's types the man's heart does have the ability a bit more to be a bit more stable a bit more steadfast would you agree like it can sort of hold the for slightly better like a man could be the same if you choose to you could be exactly the same sort of guy for the next 365 days exactly the same all day every day and you know you could the only thing that would affect you is if if you let outside circumstances affect your being but if you didn't let them you you've got the ability to just be the same all the time CU you're you're you don't you're not plagued plagued you're not run so much by your emotions you rule over them slightly more that makes sense so so the man's heart can actually is slightly stronger but that but we know that anyway because God's heart is slightly stronger than our heart very much very strong you know and it's us that go to God and say Lord I'm just I was so happy this morning now Lord Look at me now you know but the Lord's always the same he's got a strong heart and he cares but but the heart of a man though should should actually reflect and the Heart of a woman but I just want to do this to type because I'm going somewhere with this okay you understand it it it should actually reflect God and and be this be a sound heart like it it should be humble be uh these are just a few examples be kind it should be caring uh fear shouldn't be unfear it should be fear it should be um Dependable should be able to it should be strong and dependable like you can rely that it's going to be the same the next day when you talk to it it's going to be this heart's going to be strong it should be loyal uh it should be courageous man it should be all these God makes a man's heart like this and it's for a purpose because we get put on this Earth we have to then deal with human hearts and and this to me is one of the it's one of the most amazing it's an amazing journey in life and yet it's one of the most could I say I think I could say absurd that we can have children and have to be a father because I think Lord do you realize who I am I'm just honestly me and I'm supposed to be this figure this person to and and and be a father like you are to me I'm supposed to be that to these children you're talking about me I can't even sort myself out and yet before I not I've got me personally I've got five that are supposed to be like this you know some days I've sat back and thought this is a cruel Joke Man and it actually is because it wasn't designed that way I wasn't actually designed to really be a father but yet God in his great wisdom allows me to live through it so I can understand him as a father and I I can I can start to see types of things that so so I know I understand there reasons why we go through it but but still then I I end up dealing with the heart of a child now the heart of a child is a very very precious thing because you understand with the heart of a child it's for for the first portion of their life it's generally just one way and that's straight into them when you get older you can decide what comes and what comes out and change your circumstances change your environment change this change that to protect your heart when you're young it's one way and that's into you you don't have a choice you just get whatever wherever you born and whatever situation you're born in it just gets fed into you and you have no control over really what comes into your heart so if you have children my best advice I could give to you is just love them and care for their heart and I loved what brother impo said I wish I had an this earli but he said he said his mother told him this he said look at that little baby that little child is exactly the same as you all it lacks is experience that little thing that big it's exactly like you it's fully grown it just lacks experience I thought man I find you that when they were younger I was very nice of it you know but remember you these these just love them like just just feed love unto them cuz we always mess up you know and we think we parent this way and that way and this other way and read all the books and everything ah just be yourself but love them CU that's really what is going to affect their heart that person loved me he loved me or she my mother loved me see I love my dad and you know one thing I love about my dad I knew my Dad loved me there was there's never a thought in my mind your dad didn't love you my dad didn't talk much or anything hardly at all and he but I knew my Dad loved me that's never been a question I've wor SP like a million bucks my dad loves me you don't have to succeed in nothing else my dad loves me and don't forget the power you've got on your children you know because especially when they're up to about seven or eight or nine or 10 dads and Ms especially dads though Sorry Ms but dads are like the cool guy and dads are the hero you're a here enjoy it Ben you're a hero bro for the next couple of years anything you do man is just fantastic they're like wow look how look at Dad's throw that ball wow he's so strong oh my goodness they tell their friends they used why dad the other day threw that wall so far couldn't even see where it went was just over the backyard and all the brothers are going is that all you scow like that bro but to your son you're amazing and and when their hearts are open like that you can speak back and them hey you're amazing to too bro you they can be just like me you're awesome man really can I be like you yeah man better than me wow imagine how that makes them feel can I speak on this one I've got five daughters here one two three the heart of a daughter this one you know when you're a man it's a funny thing but you but I know it's the type God but you actually men seem to get Hearts put into their hands it's an unusual thing you you sort of don't you don't really get a son's hand put into your hands if you're a father but you it's you get a you get a daughter's heart that gets it gets put there and you know through the years you you love that heart and you you know when they're down you you embrace you it's all right when they when they when they come home and say look Dad look what I did he that's fantastic you're awesome man so good you you just care for this little heart you know you kind of have it in your you hold this thing and and I've often wondered like like if some guy say cuz and no I was not marriageable age yet in this country anyway but Hannah is but she's never getting married never mov and go to home because she's going to stay there for rest of her life so Brothers don't even bother but if one of you do roll in rolling the door I'm here for Hanah you know I do this I said look that do you know what's sitting in there bro you know what's sitting in here that's my daughter's heart right there in my hand that's the heart that I've looked after for 20 years when she when she had tears I embraced her when she did well I encouraged her uh I I've been with through thick and thin highs and lows ups and downs This Heart here this this means something to me and what you tell me you're just going to Walt in the door and tell me to Chuck it over to you forget it you hold out your hand hold out your hand you hold out your hand is that hand strong enough to hold this heart is it caring enough to hold this heart is it loving enough to look after this heart I don't care how much money you got money doesn't look after heart I don't care if you're you're you're you're talented in something talent doesn't look after this heart I don't care if your famous Fame doesn't look after this heart love looks after this heart care do you care are you compassionate are you loyal are you going to be loyal to that I Ain just going to hand it over to you I want to check what's in your heart what sort of heart have you got so that heart ain't going nowhere until I know it's going to a safe place and that's the way it should be this is the heart I'm talking about you tell me what what more valuable thing I could hold in my hand you tell me what's more valuable that I can hold in my hand but one of those hearts nothing that that's why when you get a heart of a wife it's such a I don't know I hope we Brothers realize what we get given when we get given a heart I hope we realize there is nothing greater in the whole wide world world than a human heart there's nothing there's nothing greater than it you tell me what there could be greater than it you do the math you work it out and to think that that Brothers we get this heart placed into our hand you're holding the most valuable thing that you're ever going to hold in your entire life right there in the palm of your hand that's the most valuable thing you're ever ever ever going to hold sir what do you think you're going to do with that no man you've been given a heart to look after care for it love it look after it be loyal to it don't mistreat it it's it's the it's honestly that you cannot put value on what you hold in your hand and the fact that someone else is willing to put theirs in your hand is outstanding when you think about it you you you'll never hold anything as valuable as that and I pray God that we understand that and we each day we realize that Lord what do I hold in my hand wow because that it goes on to a bigger picture here that God showing look I'm holding your heart in my hand and and when you think about it what's the most valuable thing that God has in his possession then on that basis what the most valuable thing God has in the whole of the universe it's exactly right it's you and I that's actually the most valuable thing that he holds in his hand is you and I because he we've given him our heart Lord I give you my heart we've given him our heart and he holds that heart in the palm of his hand and to him that's the most valuable thing in his whole world is that heart that's been placed in his hand that's why when what happens to us when we mistreat one of those hearts there you think about it that heart that God values above anything else and someone comes along and mistreats it the even speaks the wrong word until it tries to mess around with it it's such a a dangerous place to go when you begin to Tamper to harm This Heart that God has in the palm of his hand that he loves his bride something that he loves and if you look L to you and you look right to you or if you're no one's sitting next to you look up in front of you cuz that's me what you're looking at is the most valuable thing that God has in his possession is sitting right next to you that's it the most valuable thing that he has in his possession look after that thing if you want to please God look after that person sitting next to to you if you want to make God happy with you look after that heart be merciful to it if it's wrong say it's all right bro keep going encourage it love it because you don't know how much God loves that heart you know if that heart failed every single day God will still love it the same in the morning as what he in the evening as what he did in the morning before they started and went on its big failure Mission he doesn't love it less but I failed you're amazing man honestly you wouldn't believe how good you are he his his love towards that heart doesn't change it's just 100% you're amazing all day long every single day that's that's that's all it ever is it never it never changes it never it never stops it's the unquenchable Fountain of love going towards that heart and that's who we deal with here it's one thing to you know Satan gets hold of hearts and he does what he wants to you know and that but it's another thing to mistreat one of the hearts that are in the palm of God's hand and I've always been been careful of that I thought Lord I just I don't want to do Lord if it's your people Lord I'm Lord I'm going to be as good as I can I'm going to be as nice as I can to them Lord they this they in the palm of your hand I'm going to really look after this thing Lord if I if I song lead to it I'm going to speak as good as I can if I minister to him I'm going to minister grace and mercy and the truth you know I'm going to Lord I look after this sometimes he gives it to us to say here hold this me on behalf of me hold this it's such a power ful thing that was that was that was the thought that I had um on my heart excuse the pun but this evening and I just I hope that yeah we can [Music] um mainly understand really how much God loves your heart you're never a failure never you're never not good enough you're never once you're on the palm of his hand you're just the most amazing thing that it ever was so don't let Satan tell you otherwise and and on that note make sure you look after the hearts all around you like be be loving to people care for them encourage them be like brother admand you know he's full of encouragement who's been encouraged by brother admand see you're a Serial encourager does this is Brother Armand arand he's a Serial
