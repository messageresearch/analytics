[18:54] and read from Exodus 17 we're going to
[18:57] read verse 11 to 13. and um it means
[19:01] we're just going to I want to speak on
[19:02] Harmony tonight this may seem a bit of
[19:04] an odd text to open with uh but I just
[19:07] kind of I was walking along the
[19:09] riverbank
[19:10] a couple of days ago and uh this just
[19:13] you know it's good when the Lord kind of
[19:15] talks to you as you look up walk along
[19:16] the way I enjoy those moments I mean so
[19:19] um Exodus 17 and 11 and it came to pass
[19:23] when Moses held up his hand that Israel
[19:25] prevailed and when he let down his hand
[19:28] amalek prevailed this is of course
[19:29] Israel fighting the amalekites but
[19:31] Israel but Moses hands were heavy and
[19:33] they took a stone and put it under him
[19:35] and he sat there on and Moses and Hurst
[19:38] stayed up his hands uh the one on the
[19:40] one side and the other on the other side
[19:42] and his hands were steady until the
[19:43] going down to the Sun and Joshua
[19:46] discomforted amalek and his people with
[19:48] the edge of the sword amen let's um
[19:52] let's go to prayer tonight after we've

[22:06] God so have your way Lord For Your Glory
[22:08] in Jesus Christ's name amen
[22:10] hey man God bless you friends you might
[22:12] have your seats tonight so they're
[22:14] saying I want to talk about Harmony now
[22:15] now there was a Harmony between between
[22:18] what was going on on the mountain and
[22:19] what was going on on the battlefield and
[22:21] as I've said uh you know
[22:23] um a few Services ago that you know this
[22:26] this represents victory amen where where
[22:29] Moses hands were lifted up and when his
[22:31] hands were raised Israel was winning the
[22:33] battle when his hands went down Israel
[22:35] was losing the battle so it wasn't the
[22:38] victory wasn't based on the quality of
[22:40] the soldier it wasn't how how well
[22:41] Israel was trained it wasn't how good
[22:43] their weapons were you know no that had
[22:45] nothing to do with it the reason they
[22:47] were winning is when Moses hands were
[22:49] raised and we know that Samson's hands
[22:51] were raised between two pillars and
[22:52] dagon's Temple one day and he won a
[22:55] great Victory because he was willing to
[22:56] surrender and say let me die with my
[22:58] enemy and he and he killed more in his
[23:00] death than he did in his life as the
[23:02] same thing with you and I friends that
[23:03] we when we really die out to ourselves
[23:05] and let God take over you'll see more
[23:07] victories than you ever had in your
[23:08] entire life and we know that the
[23:10] greatest victory was won that down
[23:11] Calvary where now messiah's hands were
[23:13] raised like this and we know it wasn't
[23:15] the Roman's hands that you know it
[23:17] wasn't the Roman nails that held his
[23:18] hands there it was his love for you and
[23:19] I amen but he didn't just conquer a
[23:21] natural enemy he conquered whole death
[23:23] in the grave amen but you see there's a
[23:25] Harmony between what was going on in the
[23:27] battlefield and what was going on on the
[23:29] mountain top and and that should that
[23:32] that is how it should be between us and
[23:34] our Lord that there should be such a
[23:35] Harmony between us and God that his
[23:38] great victory that he won amen should be
[23:39] manifested in our lives but the only way
[23:42] that that can happen is when we are
[23:44] fully surrendered to his word so so who
[23:47] wants Harmony amen who wants Harmony
[23:49] between you and God Amen you know that
[23:51] Harmony will now come down into your
[23:53] life into your family amen so the Bible
[23:55] says in Romans chapter 8 that for as
[23:58] many as are led by the spirit of God
[23:59] they are the sons of God for we have not
[24:02] received the spirit of bondage again to
[24:03] fear but we have received the spirit of
[24:05] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father or
[24:08] my father my father the spirit itself
[24:10] beareth witness the with our spirit that
[24:12] we are the children of God and if
[24:14] children then ears ears of God join ears
[24:16] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[24:18] them we may also be glorified together
[24:21] now the reason his Spirit Beth witness
[24:23] with ours is because we agree with his
[24:25] word I mean it's it's it's such a
[24:27] Paramount thing that the holy ghost that
[24:30] wrote the Bible through maybe many
[24:31] different authors over many big space of
[24:33] time was the same God writing the same
[24:36] word amen but through different vessels
[24:37] but I was still the same author writing
[24:39] it so now if if the Holy Ghost wrote the
[24:42] Bible and the Holy Ghost is within us we
[24:44] cannot disagree with his word I mean we
[24:46] cannot we cannot fuss against his word
[24:48] we cannot say it's not true because if
[24:50] the spirit in US is the spirit that
[24:52] wrote the Bible there'll be the spirit
[24:54] answer will say Amen to every word of
[24:56] God and that's how we have harmony with
[24:58] God as when this Holy Spirit comes
[25:00] within us then everything in our life
[25:02] will say Amen to that word the word may
[25:04] expose us and say hey you've got to
[25:06] surrender you've got this besetting sin
[25:08] in your life it may test
[25:10] um strips off your back spiritually but
[25:12] you'll say Amen to it amen hallelujah so
[25:15] it's so Paramount that we always have a
[25:17] spirit that bears witness with the word
[25:19] of God
[25:20] amen because it's very eerie fair to say
[25:22] well my spirit his Spirit Bears witness
[25:24] with me but how does that come down to
[25:26] manifestation it's when the spirit in
[25:28] you says Amen to the word doesn't say
[25:30] Amen to culture doesn't say Amen says to
[25:32] someone else says or some tradition or
[25:34] something we learn but it's Amen to the
[25:36] word of God
[25:37] now I see this 365 of the fear knots or
[25:41] don't be afraid in the Bible's here's
[25:42] one this is something that I didn't get
[25:44] to on Sunday but I thought just to put
[25:46] it in my notes it says here and when we
[25:48] and when I saw him this is John the
[25:50] Revelator when he's in the character the
[25:52] spirit on the Lord's Day
[25:53] he sees the glorified Christ he says I
[25:56] fell down at his feet as dead and he
[25:57] laid his right hand upon me saying unto
[25:59] me fear not I am the first and the last
[26:01] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[26:03] behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and
[26:06] have the keys of hell and of death so
[26:09] here's the mighty conqueror amen
[26:10] revealed you know he was John he lay on
[26:13] Jesus bosom he ate with him you know he
[26:15] he was in the ship with him he slept
[26:17] with them he he journeyed with him all
[26:19] these things he didn't fall down as dead
[26:21] in that Ministry but then when he saw
[26:23] him he was glorified form he fell down
[26:25] as a dead man because he was such an
[26:27] awesome yo his presence was so awesome
[26:29] but then you see his right hand Christ's
[26:32] right hand of power came upon him said
[26:33] fear not I'm the first and the last I am
[26:36] he that liveth and was dead and behold
[26:38] I'm alive forever more amen and have the
[26:40] keys of Helen of death see women walk in
[26:42] harmony with God this is what God wants
[26:44] us to know in great trials don't fear
[26:46] I'm just going to continue a bit from
[26:48] Sunday we're just going to merge all the
[26:50] surface into one right you know don't
[26:52] fear Amen in great times of trouble fear
[26:54] not
[26:55] God has not called us to be fearful amen
[26:57] you know sir because this is what the
[26:59] mighty conqueror wants us to know
[27:00] because remember when we have fully full
[27:02] confidence in God I believe will stand
[27:04] harmony with him
[27:05] because we have full confidence in our
[27:07] ship but he'll guide us through good
[27:09] times Hard Times confusing times he'll
[27:11] guide us through every every time amen
[27:14] but if we don't have confidence in him
[27:15] then Harmony will be broken why because
[27:17] we'll try and take the situation back
[27:19] into our own hands I mean but if we have
[27:21] full confidence in him we'll commit it
[27:23] all fully to him and he'll lead us
[27:25] through
[27:26] Amen brother Bram says this now no human
[27:28] being
[27:29] could stand the full effect of that
[27:31] Vision his strength utterly Gone John
[27:33] fell at his feet as though dead by the
[27:35] hand of the Lord and love touched him
[27:37] and the voice of the blessing said fear
[27:39] not don't be afraid I'm the first and
[27:41] the last I am he that liveth and was
[27:42] dead and behold I'm alive forever more
[27:44] what is there to fear the Judgment that
[27:47] fell upon him at the cross at the grave
[27:48] and when he descended was for was for us
[27:52] he absorbed the full brunt of the wound
[27:54] of sin and there is therefore now no
[27:57] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[27:58] Jesus I think we should go happy
[28:00] shouldn't we hallelujah amen why because
[28:02] remember he took your judgment that's
[28:04] why we don't have to go to through a
[28:06] Great Tribulation the bride doesn't go
[28:07] through the Great Tribulation she goes
[28:09] in the Rapture before that time why
[28:10] because the Judgment that the world
[28:12] receives he received it for us on
[28:14] Calvary amen and because we take the
[28:16] fullness of his atonement his word amen
[28:18] we don't go to that place we go on a
[28:20] rapture glory to God I mean so the Wrath
[28:23] that was put out upon him that we should
[28:25] have received I mean it was put out upon
[28:27] Him aren't you glad he went he died as a
[28:30] sinner in your place he went to hell so
[28:32] you don't have to go
[28:33] praise God Amen he died lost so you
[28:35] don't have to die lost hallelujah amen
[28:38] I'm so thankful he died forsaken that
[28:40] we'll never die forsaken I'm so what a
[28:42] good exchange eh what a good deal
[28:44] Hallelujah there's no there's no sub
[28:46] Clauses and this is just all good
[28:48] praise the Lord
[28:50] amen now see for a surety our attorney
[28:53] is our judge he is both attorney and
[28:55] judge as judge the case is settle that
[28:57] is finished now there is therefore no
[28:59] condemnation why should the church fear
[29:01] what promise has he ever failed to
[29:03] manifest before us we can just stop
[29:06] there and just think about that for a
[29:07] second what promises he not has he what
[29:09] promise has he ever failed to manifest
[29:11] here in our lives amen he's he's healed
[29:15] the sick he's given the Holy Ghost amen
[29:18] he's cast out demons he's brought
[29:20] prodigals home amen he's brought peace
[29:22] amen he's brought Joy amen he's manifest
[29:25] every promise in his word the only thing
[29:27] we haven't seen is the physical
[29:28] resurrection of the Dead
[29:30] I believe he can do it don't you I mean
[29:33] but what promises he failed to manifest
[29:35] in our midst Hallelujah
[29:38] praise God as true as isn't he a god of
[29:40] his word he is the amen amen and he
[29:42] amends his word he has the final say
[29:45] Amen means so be it Hallelujah he's not
[29:48] afraid of any promise that he's given
[29:49] amen why should it why should it fear
[29:52] punishment or death it has all been
[29:54] overcome
[29:55] amen now here is the mighty conqueror
[29:57] here is the one who conquered Both
[29:59] Worlds of the scene and unseen not like
[30:01] Alexander who conquered the world at the
[30:02] age of 33 and you no other way to turn
[30:05] for further Conquest so he died a victim
[30:07] of sin and righteous living not like
[30:09] Napoleon who conquered all of Europe but
[30:10] finally Was Defeated at Waterloo and
[30:12] banished to Alba only to find himself
[30:14] conquered but nothing could conquer
[30:16] Christ he that descended has now
[30:18] ascended above all and unto him has been
[30:20] given a name that is above every name
[30:22] yes he conquered death hell in the grave
[30:25] and as and has the keys thereof what he
[30:27] loses is loose and what he binds is
[30:30] bound there's no changing for it there
[30:32] is no conqueror before him and there is
[30:34] none beside him he alone is the savior
[30:36] the Redeemer he's the only God in the
[30:38] Lord Jesus Christ is his name don't fear
[30:41] John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I
[30:43] am you are here too all my power is
[30:46] yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand
[30:48] in your midst I have not come to bring
[30:50] fear and failure but love and courage
[30:52] and ability all powers given unto me and
[30:55] it is yours to use you speak the word
[30:57] that I will and I will perform it that
[30:59] is my Covenant and it can never fail
[31:02] Hallelujah
[31:03] praise our God Amen and you know you
[31:06] read mark 16.
[31:08] Jesus gives the Great Commission to the
[31:10] church and that last verse of that says
[31:12] and and and the Lord went with them
[31:16] manifesting the word
[31:17] right see so what is he doing there he's
[31:20] he's performing that which he promised
[31:21] amen that you speak the word in our
[31:23] performance that is my Covenant and it
[31:25] can never fail so he's not he's not set
[31:28] us up for failure this is not a setup
[31:31] for failure I mean this Christian walk
[31:33] no he has not come to give us fear and
[31:35] failure but love courage and ability
[31:37] Hallelujah he's given us ability in
[31:40] every situation he's given us courage to
[31:43] withstand amen his love is far above
[31:46] the love of human being amen so he's
[31:49] given us all these things that we would
[31:51] overcome every situation amen but the
[31:53] but the thing is we need to trust him in
[31:55] every situation see he is the unfailing
[31:58] one right we fail many times but he's
[32:01] the unveiling one I mean so if we just
[32:03] keep our confidence in him therefore I
[32:06] believe if we do that we can stay in
[32:08] harmony with him see it's not God never
[32:10] God never loses his position he never
[32:13] gets himself out of the way it's man who
[32:15] who wanders off the path it's man who
[32:18] actually forgets their position so it's
[32:19] God always remains faithful even when we
[32:22] are not that's what the Bible says let's
[32:24] see is if we can just stay in harmony
[32:25] just love the Lord
[32:27] I mean was he giving us love to do love
[32:30] him in every circumstance amen Praise
[32:32] Him in the storm give him glory when
[32:34] things are good give him glory when
[32:36] things are bad Hallelujah this is what
[32:38] he wants us to do and you thankful we
[32:39] can do that amen what do you do
[32:41] abilities to stand in every situation
[32:44] like Shadrach me and the baby go they're
[32:46] given the ability to stand they had no
[32:49] vision they had nothing apart from the
[32:51] word of God and they said we are going
[32:53] to stay in harmony with this word that
[32:55] says you're not bow yourself to any
[32:57] Graven image
[32:58] Hallelujah to me the greatest Victory
[33:00] really yo we say about the Fourth Man In
[33:02] The Fire that's incredible but even if
[33:04] they got burnt up it was still been an
[33:06] incredible story because they didn't bow
[33:08] to any of the pressure of the age amen
[33:09] remember it wasn't just something done
[33:11] in a back alley that they were coming
[33:12] under the influence of it was the king
[33:14] trying to make them bow it was quite a
[33:16] procession it was quite an occasion but
[33:18] they had already made up their minds
[33:19] we're standing with this word so they
[33:20] were in harmony with the word and then
[33:22] God backed up the word
[33:24] Hallelujah
[33:26] see we want to be in harmony
[33:28] being in harmony is something the devil
[33:30] knows nothing about
[33:32] hell is full of fighting
[33:34] one devil can't get along with another
[33:37] they may be fighting for the same team
[33:38] but really it's just like Parliament
[33:40] during question time you know and really
[33:42] all the parliamentarians they say well
[33:44] I'm National I'm labor I'm greens I'm
[33:45] whatever they're all really they're
[33:47] ready to stick the knife in each other's
[33:49] back they won the top job
[33:52] that's just kind of like hell I'm sorry
[33:54] you know we pray for our Parliament do
[33:56] we not we pray for our leader the Bible
[33:57] says we should do so right but it's all
[33:59] fussing and fighting and you know it's a
[34:01] bunch of 12 year olds and you know
[34:02] actually that's an insult of 12 year
[34:04] olds you know I'm sure they can get
[34:05] along better than that but you know
[34:07] they're all they're all fragmented
[34:10] and it's because the enemy doesn't know
[34:12] anything about what Harmony really is
[34:14] because Fallen man doesn't know what
[34:17] Harmony really is sure we can agree
[34:19] maybe in principle of some things but
[34:21] there's no true Harmony it may be just
[34:23] Harmony and the same kind of thinking
[34:25] even the spirit but it takes God to
[34:28] unify Body Soul and Spirit together as
[34:30] one amen and when and when a people are
[34:33] in harmony that's actually that's
[34:35] actually Eden restored in a family
[34:37] this is what we want to have amen any
[34:40] man in his family a good Noble obedient
[34:42] family is one with another any family
[34:44] and if there's something in the family
[34:45] that moves them apart then it's not
[34:47] right that family is broken somewhere
[34:49] they should all be one father with
[34:50] Mother Mother with father children with
[34:52] parent parent with children all in
[34:54] agreement and when you see that you'll
[34:55] see one lovely picture who wants to see
[34:57] that kind of picture sure we can you
[34:59] know brother bam says it's like him and
[35:01] his siblings they used to fight in the
[35:02] backyard you can have disagreements you
[35:04] can have these things but when someone
[35:06] came against the Brandon family they
[35:07] were unified in the front yard
[35:09] I mean so it can be the same kind of
[35:11] thing we can have trouble you know
[35:12] disagreements and mama she did this and
[35:14] they did this and he said but but then
[35:16] when when someone comes against the
[35:18] family we're shoulder to shoulder amen
[35:20] you may have a black eye from your
[35:22] sibling in the back lawn just a moment
[35:23] ago but if someone comes against the
[35:25] family hey we're together on this one
[35:26] and it should be the same thing with the
[35:28] children of God
[35:29] Hallelujah sure we'll have disagreements
[35:31] we've had disagreements we'll have more
[35:34] in the future
[35:36] I'm glad no interrupted an appraisal
[35:37] Logistics but you see we're family I
[35:40] mean we can look beyond the natural amen
[35:43] we can look beyond the Flesh and
[35:44] identify we are all part of the same
[35:46] Jesus Christ amen I trust you can see
[35:49] that when you see your brother your
[35:50] sister look beyond what you see with the
[35:52] five senses should be able to discern
[35:54] they are part of the same body I am part
[35:56] of
[35:57] amen and if we can look Beyond then we
[35:59] can see a family that's United something
[36:01] that the devil knows nothing about and
[36:03] cannot manifest but if we're in harmony
[36:05] with God we'll be in harmony with one
[36:07] another I believe
[36:09] amen see that's God's purpose and his
[36:11] purpose was father Supreme as one as to
[36:15] be one with his family Earthly family
[36:17] Adam and Eve and the only way they could
[36:18] ever be one with the family or with God
[36:21] was because God's nature was in them so
[36:24] that made them with God's nature in them
[36:25] them with each other and God they all
[36:28] they became all one isn't that a
[36:29] beautiful picture God and his family
[36:31] father over all Supreme no death no
[36:34] sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy
[36:36] unspeakable never a sick never a
[36:39] heartache just one with God what a
[36:40] picture because the very nature of God
[36:42] was in these people and therefore what
[36:45] they did they followed just in line with
[36:47] God and God with them made them one
[36:51] amen why because God's nature was in
[36:53] them so walking in harmony with God now
[36:55] we know how people leave God as God as
[36:58] as people leave his word it's really
[37:00] quite simple it doesn't matter what they
[37:01] profess if you leave God's word you've
[37:03] left him because he is his word he
[37:05] doesn't compromise for nothing because
[37:06] his word is who he is so if we want to
[37:09] stay in harmony with God we're going to
[37:10] we need to stay harmony with his word
[37:12] amen and we know that that is not a
[37:14] lining up of rules and Ticking boxes
[37:17] because people can do that and just be
[37:19] totally dead on the inside right but if
[37:21] that same nature of God the Holy Ghost
[37:23] is within you and there's something
[37:25] within you that will want to line up
[37:26] with his word because you love him amen
[37:28] your motivation is love it's not fair or
[37:30] fail or anything but because you love
[37:32] him you want to live his word amen and
[37:34] that's how we stay in harmony with God
[37:36] now
[37:38] brother Brown would um yo was it Jack
[37:41] Moore one of the brothers he knew very
[37:42] well he said one of the most outstanding
[37:44] messages that he ever preached at
[37:45] Shreveport he preached there A lot of
[37:46] times was the lamb and the dove and
[37:48] brother Bram after he preached that he
[37:50] said one of the most outstanding
[37:51] anointings that ever came upon a service
[37:53] when he preached that service
[37:55] and
[37:56] to me it's one of the most fundamental
[37:58] principles of Christianity I'm going to
[38:00] come to the quote soon but you know one
[38:02] of the most fundamental principles of
[38:04] Christianity is the same nature that's
[38:05] in God is in us and that's the only way
[38:08] we can be in harmony with his word if
[38:11] the nature of the word is in you and I
[38:13] that's why Jesus when he went to the
[38:15] river John to be baptized by John John
[38:17] look beyond what Jesus looked like he
[38:20] looked like any other man but John said
[38:22] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[38:23] the sin of the world he identified
[38:25] prophetically that he was a man with the
[38:27] nature of a lamb Hallelujah and then
[38:30] when Jesus was baptized John saw the
[38:32] spirit of God descend upon him like a
[38:34] dove now we know the nature of a dove
[38:36] and a lamb of the same nature it wasn't
[38:38] it wasn't a raven coming down God never
[38:41] rippers out as a as a raven he was a he
[38:44] was a dove and he was a lamb very Meek
[38:46] Natures if Jesus had the nature of a
[38:48] wolf a dove would never come and descend
[38:51] upon a wolf nature because they're
[38:52] contrary Natures but because they were
[38:54] the same kind of nature the spirit of
[38:56] God could come down and dwell in him
[38:59] that's what we want isn't it that's what
[39:01] we want amen tonight amen is to have a
[39:04] lamb lamb nature not a wolf nature we're
[39:06] all born with a wolf nature fussing and
[39:09] fighting in life you don't need to teach
[39:11] a child to lie
[39:12] you don't need to teach them to steal
[39:14] that's just built within them why it's a
[39:16] wolf nature or a fallen nature
[39:18] you don't need to teach them those
[39:19] things right and Fallen man the older
[39:22] they get the more crafty they get in
[39:23] stealing cheating lying defrauding doing
[39:25] all those things but when the baptism of
[39:27] the Holy Ghost comes into a soul of a
[39:29] person it changes their nature from Wolf
[39:31] to lamb I mean where it's God's nature
[39:34] takes over and then the spirit of God
[39:36] can descend upon that person and dwell
[39:38] on them I'm so thankful that there is a
[39:41] power in this room that can change the
[39:42] nature of a person amen from a wolf to a
[39:45] lamb amen from a fallen nature of man to
[39:47] God's divine nature Hallelujah aren't
[39:50] you glad for that amen that's what
[39:51] Calvary was done to achieve Amen to take
[39:54] our sins away that God can dwell in us
[39:56] once again that was the purpose of the
[39:59] Messiah giving his life for you and I
[40:01] Hallelujah so we need to have we need to
[40:03] have a nature of a lamb amen for the
[40:06] dove of the Holy Ghost to come back Upon
[40:08] Us amen see he's the son same way
[40:11] someone that came the same one that came
[40:13] down on the day of Pentecost and led the
[40:15] church is the same holy spirit that came
[40:17] down upon uh that came down upon the
[40:19] first lamb at Jordan it's the same one
[40:21] that leads today amen and he will never
[40:24] lead you out of his word he will always
[40:27] lead you within this word this Bible
[40:28] amen he'll never take you outside of the
[40:30] pages of it amen when someone says that
[40:32] they're a Christian and says we don't
[40:33] need the Bible no more I wouldn't trust
[40:35] that person amen if someone says the
[40:38] Bible's not their absolute I'll be wary
[40:39] of those people brother Brown said the
[40:41] Bible was as absolute therefore the
[40:42] Bible is my absolute as well we know the
[40:45] message reveals Christ in the Bible we
[40:46] understand those things but you know we
[40:48] have an absolute word
[40:50] we don't have Creeds of dogmas I mean we
[40:52] have the word of God Amen Hallelujah and
[40:54] you see we have the word of God there
[40:56] and because we have the word of God and
[40:59] the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the
[41:01] word will manifest itself in our lives
[41:03] Hallelujah only glad for that praise the
[41:06] Lord amen I'm just trying to go and
[41:09] 12th gear
[41:11] you know so just keep up with me amen
[41:14] jump on board it's a free ride
[41:16] I remember you say it's very important
[41:18] that we have a lamb nature who knows
[41:20] what it's like to be carnal
[41:23] you know when you're carnal and you know
[41:25] when you're not carnal right never try
[41:27] and justify yourself when you carnal
[41:31] you're on a hiding to nowhere
[41:33] that's when because remember this thing
[41:35] needs changing right when the body
[41:37] change happens I think the older ones
[41:40] will be the happiest ones not because
[41:42] necessarily because this thing is
[41:43] getting wore out and you've got to drag
[41:44] it up and you pull muscles just getting
[41:46] out of bed in the morning but you know
[41:48] but because you've been wrestling with
[41:49] this human nature and you've seen God
[41:51] come on the scene time and time again
[41:53] but then you go into a carnal State and
[41:55] you hate yourself and then you repent
[41:57] and then you go back into Walking with
[41:58] God again and you know there's a wrestle
[42:01] right but thanks be to God the Holy
[42:04] Ghost changes our nature and gives us
[42:06] overcoming power over this thing but it
[42:09] depends who we yield our members to is
[42:11] that the one who will lead us amen so do
[42:13] we want a wolf or do we want a lamb lamb
[42:15] I like lamb I don't like wolf
[42:18] you know you take like husky dogs you
[42:21] know they can be pulling the same sled
[42:23] but something can go wrong they'll turn
[42:24] on each other and kill each other if
[42:25] they can hunting dogs different ones
[42:27] it's in the nature just to devour each
[42:29] other so I can scare one they'll attack
[42:31] the one or the owner or whatever more
[42:32] see we don't want to be like that but
[42:35] that's how humans can be something goes
[42:37] wrong they start the blame game blame
[42:38] shifting and they start tearing each
[42:40] other apart but the lamb nature can't do
[42:42] that it's not in its nature see amen so
[42:45] if that Nature's within us we just can't
[42:47] do it yeah well turn the other cheek
[42:49] amen we'll have a soft answer that turns
[42:51] away Wrath
[42:52] Hallelujah we will go pray for the those
[42:55] that despitefully use us we will love
[42:57] the unlovable
[42:58] amen I'm glad we can be like that not by
[43:01] our own ability but by his ability
[43:03] hallelujah amen so we need the Holy
[43:06] Ghost to lead us now
[43:08] I mean when we get in harmony now
[43:11] with now don't just just I hope I don't
[43:15] sound like I'm saying you get the Holy
[43:16] Ghost in you get in Harmony when you get
[43:18] the Holy Ghost you're in harmony okay so
[43:21] don't put it way off in the future I
[43:23] don't like that kind of preaching it's
[43:24] now it's here the Bible says today is
[43:26] the day of salvation today he's the same
[43:28] yesterday today and forever amen so yeah
[43:32] don't don't just get that out of your
[43:35] thinking if if you think I'm talking
[43:37] about two things here it's the same
[43:38] thing
[43:39] okay so and the church has to do the
[43:41] same thing get out of that group of
[43:42] rejecters come into the promise before
[43:44] Messiah can never be manifested before
[43:46] them you see it the life of the Messiah
[43:48] manifested making a church ready a bride
[43:50] a woman can marry a man and disagreeing
[43:53] with him it would be some kind of a fuss
[43:54] continually but when a man and his wife
[43:57] his girlfriend his espoused when they
[43:59] are in Perfect Harmony like one Soul one
[44:01] mind because they're going to be one
[44:02] flesh then when the church can get in
[44:04] such a harmony with God until the
[44:06] manifestation of the bridegroomers
[44:08] manifesting the bride because they're
[44:10] going to be one oh what a great lesson
[44:13] he said see and this is this is where
[44:15] we're at friends this is where we're at
[44:17] amen we've been we've been here for a
[44:18] while actually don't don't put this off
[44:21] in the future well one day when I'm good
[44:23] enough for long enough and I'll be in
[44:24] harmony no no we've graduated
[44:26] you've thrown your cap in the air your
[44:28] significance in your hand you've walked
[44:30] long shaken the guy's hand and you've
[44:32] gone on run Hallelujah we've Grant if if
[44:36] you've given your life to the Lord like
[44:37] really giving you I've and he's filled
[44:39] you with the Holy Ghost you've graduated
[44:41] sure you have a you know you'll be
[44:43] maturing and growing from that day on
[44:45] but remember all power of Heaven and
[44:46] Earth is actually by the Holy Ghost is
[44:48] in you the rapture's in you already amen
[44:52] all overcoming Powers within you already
[44:53] if you really have the Holy Ghost
[44:56] Hallelujah and the ability to be in
[44:59] harmony with God that he can manifest
[45:01] himself through you is in you because
[45:02] he's in you remember the Holy Ghost is
[45:04] not a part of the godhead he is the god
[45:06] here they're not three they're one right
[45:09] the fullness of God here bodily dwelt in
[45:11] Jesus Christ we know that amen
[45:13] so and the same one that came into Jesus
[45:16] in The River Jordan the fullness of God
[45:18] here bodily came down in the upper room
[45:19] and filled the disciples and he spread
[45:22] within his church and he's the same one
[45:24] today
[45:25] amen not a different God the same one
[45:27] amen you see there's a great promise
[45:29] many times people get in their minds the
[45:31] devil twisted their minds that you know
[45:33] if you really give your life to the Lord
[45:35] you know life will be no fun no really
[45:37] life really starts when you meet him
[45:39] amen a whole world opens up that you've
[45:41] never even seen before fed them before
[45:43] amen and it's a glorious walk it's not
[45:47] an easy walk all the time but life's not
[45:49] easy anyway
[45:50] you ask Elon Musk if you ever get a
[45:52] chance has it been easy he'll say no
[45:54] he's basically 24 7 or 27 hours a day
[45:58] he's played crams that many into his you
[46:00] know he's working he's trying he's
[46:02] putting effort in he's losing money
[46:04] making money upsetting a whole bunch of
[46:06] people
[46:07] we're not ordained to upset a whole
[46:09] bunch of people but just walk with God
[46:10] but you know but but he'd say no this
[46:12] took effort this this just wasn't handed
[46:15] to me
[46:15] and it's not all glamorous but people
[46:18] think man he's really he's going to Mars
[46:20] I'm going to heaven
[46:22] holy I trust you've got your ticket too
[46:24] people want to go to Mars they want to
[46:26] go in the sub-orbital flight I just want
[46:28] to take a flight that I go from this
[46:30] Dimension to the next amen like brother
[46:32] Braham said people are trying to get
[46:33] people on the moon this is back in the
[46:35] 50s and 60s saying this we've got to met
[46:37] we've had National in heaven for 2 000
[46:39] years
[46:40] hallelujah amen so I've got a better
[46:43] ride than him coming up I trust he joins
[46:45] me it'll be good but you know people
[46:47] think that you know there's there
[46:49] there's no excitement really compared to
[46:51] the world we have no excitement we
[46:53] actually have a far greater excitement
[46:54] you know a spirit of entertainment will
[46:57] just really drag you down it will never
[46:59] it'll never leave you satisfied maybe
[47:01] for a season it will but there'll come
[47:03] in emptiness and you'll seek after
[47:04] something else and you'll seek after
[47:06] something else and you'll seek after
[47:08] that other thing and the other thing
[47:09] won't satisfy you like the first 12. I'm
[47:11] listening to this band now and then
[47:13] another one I'm watching this platform
[47:15] this one this one this one trying to
[47:17] fill a void that cannot be filled by
[47:18] that kind of stuff it doesn't satisfy is
[47:21] the world Happy
[47:23] this is the most entertained age that
[47:25] the world has ever been in
[47:27] is it happy no it's the most unhappy
[47:29] world that's ever been
[47:32] anyway you see better walk with God is
[47:35] far more better than being entertained
[47:37] by an evil spirit amen it's far more
[47:39] satisfying it's far more rewarding all
[47:42] this in Heaven Too Hallelujah
[47:45] praise God Amen but you see now to be
[47:48] separated to the Lord people think well
[47:51] you there's a lot of things you can't do
[47:52] in life actually there's a lot of things
[47:54] I can do in life I can actually do
[47:55] anything I want
[47:57] but God changed my nature there's a lot
[47:59] of things I just won't go near
[48:00] because it's like a little kid that just
[48:02] doesn't like broccoli they just don't
[48:04] like it it's not in them to like it I
[48:06] remember I was that age I remember
[48:07] sitting at the table and seeing food for
[48:09] the first time and saying I don't like
[48:11] it and then and then the earth goes
[48:13] around the Sun a few years and here I am
[48:15] on the other end of that saying Eat Your
[48:17] Greens eat this food and you see this
[48:20] little face saying I don't want it
[48:23] I know where they got that
[48:25] but you see when a nature changes
[48:28] Hallelujah when a nature changes then
[48:30] hey give me the greens I need it you
[48:31] know I know it's good for me hallelujah
[48:34] amen you know why because there's been a
[48:36] change in the nature the same thing with
[48:38] the things of God Colonel nature says I
[48:40] don't want it there's nothing to it but
[48:42] let God get a hold of you once and you
[48:44] say Lord I love your presence I love
[48:45] knowing you Lord
[48:47] amen hallelujah so what agreement has
[48:50] the temple of God with Idols for ye are
[48:51] the Temple of the Living God as he has
[48:53] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[48:56] them and I'll be their God and they
[48:58] shall be my people amen wherefore come
[49:01] out from among them and be separate
[49:02] saith the Lord that's not the unclean
[49:04] thing and I will receive you and I'll be
[49:06] a father unto you and you shall be my
[49:08] sons and my daughter saith the Lord
[49:11] Almighty amen so this is a great benefit
[49:13] from to being separated to God that God
[49:16] can walk in us he can live through us he
[49:19] can talk through us and if he does that
[49:20] then Harmony comes in or rather that is
[49:24] perfect harmony amen and then that
[49:26] Harmony now can come into the family
[49:27] it's not the father with his own selfish
[49:30] little Hobbies pulling this way you know
[49:32] and then the mother pulling this way
[49:33] trying to do what she wants to do and
[49:35] then trying to use the trying to
[49:36] convince the children that they're the
[49:38] better one
[49:39] parents would not mean to be politicians
[49:41] trying to get our children's vote
[49:43] vote for me I'm way more fun than that
[49:45] guy or votes me and wait mom she's
[49:48] boring I'm way more cooler vote for me
[49:50] but but saying it and doing it in such a
[49:53] way that they don't like this other
[49:55] spouse
[49:56] that's actually demonic we shouldn't be
[49:58] like that at all we should be saying to
[50:00] our children like I tell I tell my girls
[50:03] they can vouch for this I say you got
[50:05] the greatest mom in the world
[50:06] there's no one like her she's the best I
[50:09] say in all the lands and there's a lot
[50:10] of lands that's what I say and I mean it
[50:13] why because they need to appreciate it
[50:15] appreciate her and they need to realize
[50:18] I love worth everything within me and I
[50:20] appreciate it right and that's how we
[50:22] should be
[50:23] it's like with you and the Lord isn't it
[50:25] he's the greatest one ever
[50:26] we should all be his biggest fan
[50:29] Hallelujah amen that that's how we
[50:31] should feel and about one another we say
[50:33] they're the greatest bunch of people
[50:35] sure there's people like us all around
[50:37] the world we're not the only ones thank
[50:39] God but this should be something in us
[50:41] and I should feel and I feel everyone
[50:42] should feel this about their home church
[50:43] it's the best one not that we compare
[50:46] right but they should be something to
[50:47] say I love this family of God sure I
[50:49] love to travel see other families of God
[50:51] around the world and through the country
[50:52] but this one there's no place like home
[50:56] Hallelujah
[50:58] amen you see now there should be
[51:00] something within us that punctuates
[51:02] every word with an amen
[51:04] it's so vital that there's that we do
[51:07] not fight against the word of God if we
[51:08] want Harmony see it's easy to say we've
[51:10] got Harmony praise God but what about
[51:11] when it comes down to the nitty-gritty
[51:13] and even simple things like water
[51:15] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ that
[51:18] the prophet says you don't even need
[51:19] Revelation for you just read Matthew 28
[51:21] 19. it says baptize in the name of the
[51:24] father son Holy Ghost and then you go to
[51:26] Acts chapter 2 and Peter says what that
[51:28] name is because I'm a father I'm a son
[51:31] I'm a brother I'm an uncle I'm a nephew
[51:33] I'm all kinds of things but that's not
[51:34] my name my name is Benjamin John Glenn
[51:36] so when Jesus said baptized in the name
[51:38] of the father son Holy Ghost one name
[51:41] Peter came the same Jesus that was
[51:43] speaking in Matthew 28 came and dwelt in
[51:46] his church and he said repent to be
[51:48] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[51:50] a mission of sin there's no
[51:51] contradiction the same Jesus in Matthew
[51:53] is the same Jesus and acts remember the
[51:55] book of Acts is the acts of the Holy
[51:57] Ghost and the apostles
[51:58] it's not the acts the apostles like
[52:00] people say they didn't do those things
[52:01] they were cowards hidden in the upper
[52:03] room but then the other day of Pentecost
[52:05] they went out with boldness
[52:07] Hallelujah so now there should be
[52:10] something within us that punctuates that
[52:12] word and says amen and we can go through
[52:13] hundreds of those those kind of things
[52:15] we're just going to leave it with that
[52:16] one but there should be something within
[52:18] us that doesn't fight against the word
[52:20] of God if the spirit in US fights
[52:22] against the word we need to get rid of
[52:23] that Spirit when he realized that spirit
[52:25] is our enemy it's not our friend amen
[52:28] because any spirit that stops you
[52:29] fulfilling the word of God is not the
[52:31] Holy Ghost
[52:32] it's really that simple like um
[52:34] Christine's dead Albert he was baptized
[52:36] in the titles
[52:37] came among believers he saw people
[52:40] should be baptized in the name of Jesus
[52:42] Christ he was wrestling in himself about
[52:43] it then he thought to himself what is
[52:45] trying to stop me fulfilling the word so
[52:48] he got baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:50] yes that's not rocket science we need to
[52:52] think about these things what what stops
[52:54] US
[52:56] what stops us because we've got to
[52:57] realize that God this harmony actually
[53:00] God hates disharmony we could go through
[53:03] you know there's a statue of the perfect
[53:04] man in the Bible there's also the statue
[53:06] of the imperfect man
[53:08] right you go on Proverbs and things
[53:10] there's actually the statue of the
[53:11] imperfect man we don't have time to go
[53:13] through it tonight but part of that is
[53:15] actually breaking up Brotherhood
[53:18] lies malice all those things and so God
[53:21] hates the spirit of this Unity he hates
[53:25] factions and fussing and fighting and
[53:27] building walls and well I won't talk to
[53:29] this group I won't talk to these people
[53:31] no we should never have that kind of a
[53:33] kind of an attitude
[53:35] you say well they don't believe the same
[53:37] way as you and I if you've got a
[53:39] revelation you can go anywhere you
[53:42] shouldn't be afraid amen
[53:46] I'll talk to him later
[53:49] you see this should be such a Harmony
[53:52] between believers
[53:54] birds of a feather flock together
[54:00] Steve says hi
[54:04] I can't decline this
[54:09] okay we'll leave that alone hopefully
[54:12] but there should be such a Unity Among
[54:13] Us
[54:14] we should love everybody
[54:16] doesn't matter what they've done you can
[54:18] still love them
[54:19] you've done a lot of bad things yourself
[54:22] but Jesus look Beyond those and loved
[54:26] you anyhow
[54:27] amen but you see Rebellion is the sin of
[54:29] Witchcraft see and your and stubbornness
[54:31] is as iniquity and idolatry this is what
[54:34] the Lord says about these things so many
[54:36] times we think of witches stirring a big
[54:38] cauldron with a big pointed hat but
[54:41] really actually a lot of Witchcraft can
[54:42] just be people who look like message
[54:43] people
[54:45] who are actually stubborn and rebellious
[54:47] against the word of God because they've
[54:48] got a spirit that doesn't bear witness
[54:49] with the Holy Ghost
[54:51] we don't want to be in that kind of
[54:52] group we say Lord I want my spirit to
[54:55] say Amen to your word
[54:57] if I'm wrong I'm wrong Lord but you're
[54:59] here to make me right and I want to be
[55:01] right
[55:02] Hallelujah this is how we want to be
[55:05] now
[55:06] I'm going to kind of wrap up soon with
[55:08] this I know I've been going
[55:09] a bit quick
[55:11] but brother Brown was was inspired and
[55:13] he wrote what he called the word to the
[55:15] church and this is just a part of it he
[55:17] says from a little group of the true
[55:19] seed of the word God will present Christ
[55:20] with a beloved bride she'll be Verge she
[55:24] is a version of his word she's virgin
[55:26] because she knows no man-made Creeds or
[55:28] dogmas and buying through the members of
[55:31] the Bride will be manifested all that
[55:33] was promised of God to be made manifest
[55:35] in the Virgin the words of Promise came
[55:38] to the Virgin Mary but that word was the
[55:40] promise was he himself to be made
[55:42] manifest God was made manifest he
[55:44] himself acted at that at that time and
[55:47] fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the
[55:49] Virgin it was an angel that brought her
[55:51] the message but the Angel's message was
[55:53] the word of God Isaiah 9 and 6 he
[55:56] fulfilled at that time all that was
[55:58] written of her because she accepted his
[56:00] word to her
[56:02] the members of the Virgin bride will
[56:04] love him
[56:05] and they will be his potentials as he is
[56:09] their head and all power belongs to him
[56:11] they are subject to him as the members
[56:13] of our bodies are subject to our own
[56:15] heads
[56:17] see
[56:18] to raise this hand I don't need to say
[56:21] hand raised now then my hand thinks
[56:23] about it and decides I should do it it
[56:25] just doesn't right I step here it just
[56:28] happens there's not a there's not a
[56:30] committee meeting and all the nerves in
[56:32] my hand to say well should we really do
[56:33] this one I'm tired I don't feel like you
[56:35] know no it just happens right it's the
[56:37] same thing with the bride of Jesus
[56:39] Christ
[56:40] if we're in harmony with him
[56:43] whatever his word says do we do
[56:46] if we've gotta forgive someone this is
[56:49] something in us that can't hold it
[56:50] anymore we've got to if we're gonna go
[56:52] make something right we just need to go
[56:53] do it amen we may be looking at
[56:55] something on our phone something that
[56:56] displeases him and so I'm going to say
[56:58] is we should stop watching that we put
[57:01] it down
[57:02] amen we get a bit stubborn we get we
[57:05] think we've made it and we get full of
[57:06] Pride and all these things something
[57:07] gonna says I don't like that anymore you
[57:10] shouldn't be that way
[57:11] praise God Amen all power belongs and
[57:14] they are subject to him as the members
[57:15] of our body are subject to our heads
[57:17] notice the harmony between the father
[57:19] and the son Jesus never did now this is
[57:21] really where my thought came from Jesus
[57:22] never did anything until it was first
[57:24] showed him by the Father John 5 19. this
[57:27] harmony is now to exist before the groom
[57:29] and his bride John 5 19 as the son can
[57:33] do nothing till he sees a father do it
[57:34] and that what the father does the son
[57:36] does likewise right so he was led Jesus
[57:39] because remember Jesus though he was the
[57:41] god man we understand that right he
[57:43] wasn't a Jew he wasn't a gentile it was
[57:46] God made flesh right it was more than
[57:48] just a Jew we're not saved by Jewish
[57:50] blood we're not saved by Gentile blood
[57:52] we're saved by the blood of God
[57:54] amen and so now but you see he had to
[57:57] conform himself to be a human to be like
[58:00] us to be our Kinsmen Redeemer see at the
[58:03] limit as understanding limit himself
[58:05] exactly as we are limited we don't know
[58:07] the future
[58:08] Jesus said it's not given to me to know
[58:10] only the Father in heaven right he was
[58:12] led by Vision amen amen you know you can
[58:16] see that in the gospels right but you
[58:18] see now as he was led by the and he said
[58:20] it's not me that do it the works of the
[58:21] father dwelt in me he do he does the
[58:23] works right so now Jesus was led by the
[58:27] spirit of God within him
[58:28] and so what he was led to do he did it
[58:31] that's why he went to the pool of
[58:33] Bethesda there were multitudes of
[58:34] sickler but he's led to one man why
[58:37] because he is led by a vision to that
[58:39] one man when he went to the well by
[58:41] Samaria where the woman came the woman
[58:43] at the well we call her he was led there
[58:45] he says I need to go by the way of
[58:47] Samaria he saw it by Vision he went
[58:49] there and saw the vision fulfilled
[58:51] praise God you say well I don't see
[58:54] Visions but you do have the Holy Ghost
[58:56] we're not all called to see visions
[58:58] right but we do all should have the Holy
[59:01] Ghost leading us amen we have his word
[59:04] that guides us
[59:06] so this harmony is now to exist between
[59:08] the groom and his bride he shows her his
[59:12] Word of Life she receives it she never
[59:14] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[59:16] not even death for if the seed be
[59:18] planted the water will raise it up again
[59:20] here's the secret of this the word is in
[59:22] the bride as it was in Mary the bride
[59:25] was in uh has the mind of Christ if she
[59:27] knows what he wants done with the word
[59:31] now that may sound a bit cryptic but we
[59:33] know what he was done with his word in
[59:35] other words we know he's not three he's
[59:37] one we know how to baptize right we know
[59:40] how to dress a way that pleases him we
[59:42] know how to treat each other the right
[59:44] way
[59:45] that's that's us knowing what he wants
[59:47] done with his word we know how to treat
[59:49] the people to treat everyone in the
[59:51] Earth with love and consideration yeah
[59:53] right right we know not the whole
[59:55] grudges we know not to fuss and fight
[59:58] and and and and spread gospel and Malice
[1:00:01] amen that's all part of his word we know
[1:00:03] those things don't we if you've got the
[1:00:05] mind of Christ then you know what he
[1:00:06] wants and then what is also what he does
[1:00:08] once done with his word he wants his
[1:00:10] word to have preeminence over us that's
[1:00:12] not our Humanity that leads us it's his
[1:00:15] word that leads us
[1:00:17] right that's exactly what he does uh
[1:00:20] once done amen he doesn't be because
[1:00:22] what's happened is man has taken his
[1:00:23] word put it to one side and taken Creed
[1:00:26] and dogmas and traditions and made that
[1:00:28] be the head of the body
[1:00:29] but we don't want that to be our head we
[1:00:31] want the word of God to be our head
[1:00:33] because Jesus is his word amen in the
[1:00:36] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:00:38] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:00:40] Word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us
[1:00:42] amen she performs the command of the
[1:00:44] word in his name for she has thus saith
[1:00:46] the Lord
[1:00:47] what do we have we have the Vindicated
[1:00:49] truth of the word we don't have man's
[1:00:52] opinion we don't have a good idea we
[1:00:54] don't have hashtag trending gospel we
[1:00:57] have the word of God right not based on
[1:01:00] culture not based on anything like that
[1:01:02] it's based our walk is based solely on
[1:01:04] the word of God Amen she performs the
[1:01:07] command of the word in his name for she
[1:01:09] has thus saith the Lord then the word is
[1:01:10] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:01:12] pass like a seed that is planted in
[1:01:15] watered it comes to full Harvest serving
[1:01:17] its purpose those in the bride will do
[1:01:20] only his will none can make them do
[1:01:24] otherwise they have thus said the Lord
[1:01:26] all they keep still so for example if
[1:01:28] we've got scripture on it we do it
[1:01:30] that's why we lay hands on the sick
[1:01:31] that's why anoint the sick with oil
[1:01:33] according to the scripture amen
[1:01:35] everything we do the Bible says
[1:01:37] everything in word or deed do in the
[1:01:39] name of Jesus Christ right so everything
[1:01:41] we do
[1:01:43] that's a lot of things now I'm not just
[1:01:45] talking about church now I'm talking
[1:01:46] about your whole life
[1:01:47] right can you do it in the name of Jesus
[1:01:50] Christ
[1:01:51] things you watch places you go your
[1:01:55] conversations
[1:01:56] you know you
[1:01:58] there's some things that we say to one
[1:02:00] another
[1:02:01] we can't really say
[1:02:03] we can't say it in the name of the Lord
[1:02:04] Jesus Christ or about people
[1:02:07] everything we should say should be we
[1:02:09] should be able to say this in the name
[1:02:10] of Jesus Christ
[1:02:12] help us Lord
[1:02:13] help us Lord
[1:02:15] amen they know what uh it has they know
[1:02:20] it has to be God in them doing the works
[1:02:21] fulfilling his own word we know it's him
[1:02:24] right
[1:02:25] I trust you know that it's he's the
[1:02:27] Christian in your life not your own
[1:02:29] ability amen he did not complete all his
[1:02:31] work while he was in his Earthly
[1:02:33] Ministry so he now works in and through
[1:02:35] the bride he never came to New Zealand
[1:02:37] he never went to South Africa
[1:02:40] amen he never went to Europe he was
[1:02:42] never in America he was only there in
[1:02:44] Palestine but he says as the father has
[1:02:47] said me so I send to you yeah amen the
[1:02:49] father sent him went in him right and
[1:02:51] the same one went in his church and he
[1:02:53] still does today
[1:02:55] praise the Lord amen that's why
[1:02:57] Redemption has always actually been tied
[1:02:59] into mankind maybe we'll go through that
[1:03:01] another time but you see he works his
[1:03:03] ministry he now works in and through his
[1:03:05] bride now we know that doesn't mean we
[1:03:06] purchase anyone's salvation he did that
[1:03:08] on Calvary right but God uses his body
[1:03:11] to gather his elect to himself remember
[1:03:14] like Peter was P Peter you know or we'll
[1:03:18] go to Cornelius Cornelius had a
[1:03:20] visitation of an angel said you're a
[1:03:22] devout man Cornelius your arms and
[1:03:24] prayers are coming before God now the
[1:03:25] angel didn't say now this is the way of
[1:03:27] Salvation he said go get Peter and Joppa
[1:03:29] right and then and then Peter had the
[1:03:31] vision of the um your unclean animals
[1:03:33] coming down the sheet three times and
[1:03:35] those things then Peter went to
[1:03:36] cornelius's house because Cornelius sent
[1:03:38] servants to find him and then he
[1:03:40] preaches the word and cornelius's house
[1:03:41] the Holy Ghost Falls right the people
[1:03:44] receive eternal life and he says shall
[1:03:46] we forbid water as they have received
[1:03:47] the Holy Ghost like we did and they'll
[1:03:49] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but
[1:03:51] he said the angel could have said here's
[1:03:52] the Holy Ghost but he said no go get
[1:03:54] Peter why because God works through his
[1:03:55] body
[1:03:57] hallelujah amen amen amen
[1:04:00] praise the Lord she knows that for us
[1:04:02] not yet time for him to do certain
[1:04:03] things he must that he must do now but
[1:04:06] he will now fulfill through his bride
[1:04:07] the work which he left for this specific
[1:04:09] time
[1:04:11] Hallelujah
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:16] and praise the Lord now
[1:04:19] I'm just going to kind of close with
[1:04:20] this now what a confirmation to see a
[1:04:22] lamb and Dove come together Heaven and
[1:04:24] Earth United God and man united and one
[1:04:28] of the sins of the world was kissed away
[1:04:31] all roughness and all Death and All
[1:04:32] sorrow and all sickness was kissed away
[1:04:35] when the lamb and the dove became United
[1:04:38] together and it'll do the same thing to
[1:04:40] you when it unites with you when the
[1:04:43] Dove and lamb comes together their
[1:04:45] Natures are the same
[1:04:47] I mean saw the roughness all the fussing
[1:04:50] and fighting of the world all trying to
[1:04:51] be better than your friends and trying
[1:04:53] to be the one who's the big shot you
[1:04:55] know God will take that all out of you
[1:04:57] we're really all you'll really worry
[1:04:58] about it's not what your Social Circle
[1:05:00] thinks of you it's what the Lord thinks
[1:05:02] of you that's the thing that will matter
[1:05:04] Above All Things why because the Dove
[1:05:08] and the lamb come together your nature
[1:05:10] becomes a lamb nature or a dove nature
[1:05:14] amen you see if you just you know firing
[1:05:17] lots of barbs with your tongue you got
[1:05:19] to realize Lord that that's not your
[1:05:21] nature speaking out of me that's my
[1:05:23] Fallen nature Lord take this out of me
[1:05:24] help me to brighten my tongue Lord you
[1:05:26] take over lord Jesus might not feel any
[1:05:28] order yo you say well I'm tired I just
[1:05:31] had a bad day don't worry about those
[1:05:33] things
[1:05:33] we all have bad days we'll have hard
[1:05:35] times but that doesn't give us license
[1:05:37] people say well I'm grumpy they're gonna
[1:05:40] let grumpy rule you
[1:05:42] right honestly you know I'm grumpy this
[1:05:45] is just I just rolled out the wrong side
[1:05:46] of the bed
[1:05:48] we have ability by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:50] see nowadays people say however you feel
[1:05:52] you just become that way
[1:05:54] right Feel Like a Woman become a woman
[1:05:56] feel like a man become a man do this do
[1:05:58] that you know but no God gives us the
[1:06:00] ability to buy his holy spirit to take
[1:06:02] grumpy and say grumpy go away
[1:06:05] I might feel this way I'm not living
[1:06:07] this way
[1:06:08] I might feel grumpy I may have a bee in
[1:06:10] my Bonnet well I'm just going to open
[1:06:11] the Bonnet let the bee go away
[1:06:13] right that's how we should be why
[1:06:15] because God has given us if we stay
[1:06:17] surrendered to him we stand harmony with
[1:06:19] him we can't help maybe feeling grumpy
[1:06:21] if I have I don't have afternoon sleeps
[1:06:24] if I do I wake up grumpy I feel like I'm
[1:06:27] jet lagged and my face is a little
[1:06:28] mushed and it's not good it's not good
[1:06:30] for anyone so we don't do that stuff you
[1:06:33] know but see the thing is you may wake
[1:06:35] up grumpy don't let grumpy rule you you
[1:06:38] may be frustrated don't leave
[1:06:39] frustration rule you you may feel
[1:06:41] resentment don't let it rule you you
[1:06:43] don't need to it's not your portion
[1:06:44] you've got a greater ability Yo God is
[1:06:47] greater than grumpy God is greater than
[1:06:50] flusterations fussing with it
[1:06:51] frustration God's greater if you're
[1:06:53] frustrated take it to God
[1:06:55] if you're feeling grumpy take it to God
[1:06:57] those things really should just harness
[1:06:58] you and put you into prayer
[1:07:01] say Lord I'm not meant to feel this way
[1:07:04] and we shouldn't be governed by feelings
[1:07:05] anyway
[1:07:07] you know what are we
[1:07:09] which is going to finish with us now
[1:07:10] what do we do then the mind let the mind
[1:07:12] that was in Christ what is that what the
[1:07:15] Bible said the mind that was in Christ
[1:07:16] be with you now this is actually my last
[1:07:18] slide and and that's for real life what
[1:07:20] kind of a mind did he have stay with the
[1:07:22] word that's right stay with the word the
[1:07:24] father's word and defeated the enemy
[1:07:26] every time now when the enemy attacks
[1:07:28] and tries to say you've got to do this
[1:07:29] and God to do that what are you going to
[1:07:31] do stay with the word that's right what
[1:07:33] do you want to do then take the word
[1:07:34] what is the word the Bible said here we
[1:07:36] just read it for the spirit and of the
[1:07:39] word and of God is the word see look
[1:07:41] here and take the helmet of salvation
[1:07:42] and and The Sword and the sword of the
[1:07:45] spirit the sword of the spirit what the
[1:07:47] spirit that come in through your mind
[1:07:49] and enters into you and the sword that
[1:07:51] of that spirit is the word of God what
[1:07:54] does that Spirit fight with what does
[1:07:56] the Holy Ghost fight with Sensations
[1:07:58] feelings the word
[1:08:00] I'm in heart few Glory what does it
[1:08:02] fight with feelings word word just stay
[1:08:04] with it words see word of God is what
[1:08:06] the spirit fights with and because Jesus
[1:08:09] showed in the desert that he conquered
[1:08:11] Satan after 40 years 40 years 40 days
[1:08:15] amen no food hungry say it because Satan
[1:08:19] always comes at our weak points he never
[1:08:21] comes when you're full of Vitality
[1:08:23] you're having a good day maybe you're a
[1:08:25] morning person you're feeling really
[1:08:26] good in the morning the devil don't turn
[1:08:28] up then
[1:08:29] maybe you're a night person he doesn't
[1:08:30] turn up in the night time when you're
[1:08:31] feeling 100 he comes when you're feeling
[1:08:34] down you're feeling wore out you've had
[1:08:36] a hard day hard week hardly you know
[1:08:38] that's when he comes against you because
[1:08:40] he knows you're in a weakened State
[1:08:41] isn't the devil a coward
[1:08:43] isn't he a cow that guy but he'll come
[1:08:46] against you when you're in that kind of
[1:08:47] state but you re but you see Jesus after
[1:08:50] 40 days in the in the desert he proved
[1:08:53] it doesn't take his great power to
[1:08:55] conquer Satan it just takes the word of
[1:08:58] God will defeat him any place any time
[1:09:02] anywhere how do you think Jesus felt
[1:09:04] after a 40-day fast he wasn't running
[1:09:07] laps he wasn't feeling good he was
[1:09:09] starving he was hungry he would you know
[1:09:12] he wasn't feeling the best but he's
[1:09:14] showing that the word is greater than
[1:09:16] the feeling
[1:09:17] you don't have to feel good to be an
[1:09:18] overcomer it's not feelings that
[1:09:20] overcome it's the word of God Amen and
[1:09:23] if you walk in harmony with the word not
[1:09:25] your opinion but the word of God you're
[1:09:26] walking in Harmony Just quote the word
[1:09:28] no matter how you feel
[1:09:30] you may feel like a total
[1:09:32] waste of space quote that word you might
[1:09:35] feel like there's no way that you're
[1:09:36] going to take a Rapture quote that word
[1:09:38] don't get caught up in how you feel
[1:09:40] remember it's not my feelings are you
[1:09:41] saved it's not by feelings are you
[1:09:43] healed it's not by feelings you take a
[1:09:45] Rapture it's not you it's not going to
[1:09:47] be this euphoric feeling that's going to
[1:09:49] wash over us and then we're going to
[1:09:50] take and then we're Rapture Ready no
[1:09:51] it's when the Holy Ghost comes into you
[1:09:54] and he lives through you he seals you
[1:09:57] into the kingdom to the day of your
[1:09:58] Redemption your Rapture Ready
[1:10:01] some of us probably be feeling not so
[1:10:03] good the day of the Rapture these bodies
[1:10:04] will still be changed some of us will be
[1:10:06] feeling great these bodies will be
[1:10:08] changed some of us will be asleep
[1:10:10] maybe even having a bad night's sleep
[1:10:13] because it says in the Bible there'll be
[1:10:14] two work in the field one will be taken
[1:10:16] when I be left turn the bed one will be
[1:10:18] taken one of we left the Rapture is a
[1:10:19] universal Rapture around the world so
[1:10:21] whenever it starts there'll be people
[1:10:23] asleep
[1:10:24] and maybe they've just hurt their back
[1:10:25] just rolling over in their bed I know
[1:10:27] it's I'm not trying to sound like a joke
[1:10:29] but yeah there'll be some people in that
[1:10:30] condition but they'll be taken away
[1:10:32] because the Holy Ghost has sealed them
[1:10:33] into the kingdom and they're ready to go
[1:10:36] if you're awake or you're asleep you're
[1:10:38] ready
