i would love to greet you in the precious and wonderful name of the lord jesus christ and it's a wonderful privilege for me to stand in front of you here today bringing you greetings from the church back home and may god bless you all good to see all the familiar faces and to stand here together and just to worship the lord in spirit and in truth it is wonderful to be a child of the living god to find your position and to know that he is an unchanging god a wonderful god and we appreciate the lord this morning i'm happy to have my wife with me here today and just being such a blessing in my life and such a support it is wonderful and we are happy to hear that our precious brother ben is going full time into the ministry that's quite a big surprise and i'm sure the church is happy and excited and it's it's just good when the lord has called the man he has called his wife and together they will be able to stand in faith to be faithful to be true to that calling and we are blessed to know them and we appreciate the invitation to stand here today and we really appreciate them they love and their love for the lord and the love for the people of god that's what counts and i believe that is what god has called them for to serve the bride of the living god and we want to say may god bless them and just continue to strengthen them and keep them strong in the faith of the lord for your sake as a church as moses arms became weak somebody had to lift them up and we know that we are in a battle you know this journey is a long journey but it's a wonderful journey a journey full of experiences full of joy full of the gladness of the lord but the lord is faithful in all things so we trust and we believe that he will help in all these things as we come together this morning amen i'm happy also for brother and paul and the family sister chappie to take good care of us and feed us and make sure we don't starve you know so far it's been going well they're actually overfeeding us at this stage but we appreciate them for their love and their kindness and just to be able to see them all again so may god bless you amen thank you let us stand and turn in our bibles this morning the philippians chapter 2 verse 5 philippians chapter 2 verse 5. we really appreciate the songs of zion this morning just wonderful to create such an atmosphere because without the atmosphere that word of the lord can never flow but the importance of laying that foundation amen philippians 2 verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of his servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also had highly exalted him and giving me a name which is above every name that that the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in earth and things under the earth that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father amen let's bow our heads again father as we bow in your presence one more time this morning we appreciate thee lord for thy presence we appreciate thee for thy unfailing word of promise we thank the lord that we can come together this morning lord with our cups raised high because you said oh father god whatever we desire you can complete that desire in our lives and so this morning lord we want to surrender ourselves this meeting everyone present here that you will be moving from person to person that your word will speak life into our hearts of god that you will quicken us o god closer unto thee o father and that your grace will be sufficient in our midst this morning we surrender the meeting to the asking thy hand of grace upon us all now asking thy presence in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen you may take your seeds amen wellington has got strange weather is that right last time we were here i said to the brothers no this weather is beautiful we have sunshine no wind nothing but this time around it's different but you know god is a god of variety so sometimes the wind must blow and sometimes the sun must shine and sometimes it must rain but we live through all these things more than victorious in christ jesus so i want to just talk to you this morning to have the mind of christ amen you know it's an expression as the bible teaches and as an expression let the mind be in you which was also in christ jesus now it's a crucial factor for every one of us to understand this morning that that god is an unchanging god and god's ways is not our ways it's it is a secret principle that every believer must remember every morning of your life you know my ways is not god's way god's ways which we're talking about your natural ways your natural mind the way you think the way you reason it is not god's way of reasoning it's not god's way of thinking and if we understand that principle it helps us to to face difficult situations it help us to make right decisions it help us to guide us along the journey of life because the prophet says we are human and all the worldly knowledge is no more than a canary brain amen so you can be the most cleverest person on the face of the earth you can be an einstein you can be somebody that can do mathematical genius work and and discover things but it's all a canary brain compared to god it is not even coming close to the capacity of the mind of god amen all that you do you will just hurt yourself with it you've got to have the mind of god so with your mind you will only hurt yourself once you realize that that even if i'm the most cleverest person in the church i can only hurt myself with that mind once you lay that aside and you realize you know this mind is going to hurt me yeah have you ever thought about it that way my mind is actually something that can hurt me it cannot bless me it cannot come close to the things of god it cannot achieve the things that god wants us to achieve then that takes some pressure off me because then i know i don't have to be clever in the worldly things i don't have to have an eye iq i don't have to have anything like that i have to have the mind of god that makes the difference in life because your own ideas will only hurt you and it's important to understand that amen 1 corinthians 11 verse 1 he says be followers of me even as i am also of christ amen so the mind of christ brings a believer to its position the mind of christ reveals to you who you are what is your position in christ and in the world that we live in and it brings us stability amen it removes you from the spiritual amnesia and placing you into the full knowledge and understanding of who i am it is that that position that's why when paul says be followers of me even as i am of christ that is not the natural mind speaking amen that is not that is god's mind speaking that people will come and they will follow a man but into the world it would look like i'm following a man but from god's perspective i'm following god in the man that anointed gift that god is bringing forward that's why when people were following they followed paul but it wasn't paul they followed he says follow me as i follow christ not my own doing not my own ideas but as i follow christ you follow me and so every messenger came with that same inspiration be followers of me which doesn't mean be ye equal with me i mean be ye the same as me in that sense because when god is not the author of confusion that's why when he sends a messenger like paul there was not a second paul there was not a backup to paul there was not a number two to paul paul was number one and that's where it ends that's why he says do follow me and if i'm not there follow that one it is not like that in the mind of god because when god sends a messenger he is the only messenger for that age there is no replacement there is no second one there is no third one fourth one it is him and him alone amen so we have to understand that it brings a a principle of discipleship yes that's why when you become a disciple of jesus christ you become a follower a disciple becomes a learner of jesus christ amen not a somebody but you look at the master and the disciples desire is to be like the master man that's his greatest desire amen that's why they said lord teach us to preach teach us to bring teachers these things they didn't come with their own inspiration when they tried their own inspiration they got a big rebuke yeah that's right like one day jesus told them you know i'm the end is near i'm going to be killed yeah oh my my man and who got excited peter rolled up his sleeves and grabbed him and start to shake him oh my god i'm gonna cast out this demon from him and jesus said to him get behind me satan not to him but the anointing that tried to hinder the work of god and peter was a bit deflated but the principle of the disciple is to become like the master to become in the real sense not in pharisee or an actor but to be real in every essence to say if i can be like the master then i have achieved my discipleship i don't want to become more than the master i don't want to know more than jesus christ i don't want to know more than what he has revealed what he has become that's what i need to become amen so he says with the mind of christ you serve god the inward part the inward part you serve god the subconscious that's where faith lies amen so many times you know something is going to happen you get a thought you get an inspiration and it happens he says that's the mind of god that inspiration that works through us it comes from that deep sense that unconscious part where faith dwells that you can see things and things come to you now the christian looks at things that he doesn't see with his eyes for we look at the unseen you know with the inside eye you see by faith amen you see from that principle because the whole christian armor is an unseen armor not one of the christian armor is seen armor you don't walk in here with big swords on your side big helmets people like to make it seen and that's why they like the physical expression some churches they bring big horns and they blow horns i don't know if you have it here but by us you know they like that expression they blow horns and they do funny things because i want to see the natural armor but god's armor is not a synonym it is a complete unseen armor so as you sit here this morning you are equipped with certain armor to fight this battle but it's an unseen armor is that's why you when i look at you i see faith when i look at you i see the expression of god's grace but it's not physical but from the inside amen because paul said i serve god with my mind but with but my flesh from the natural mind my flesh serves the flesh but from the inside of the mind of god i serve god so there's always a war inside of you there's a natural part and there's a spiritual part that's why with your natural mind you cannot understand the things of god never ever and it's very important so what is in the mind of god as the prophet comes he says let me take you into the back parts of the man the mind of god let me take you before god was god let me take you before there was a world let me take you hundreds and billions of years before there was time and he take us back into the mind of god that's only a prophet that can do that because he gets that inspiration from the mind of god and he can tell you what happened in the garden of eden exactly he will tell you how the serpent operated and how they were kicked out of the garden and how they were crying and he can even describe to you the emotions that you can see with your own spiritual eyes see man what a scene that was not a good storyteller that was not somebody that just put something together it is the mind of god in a prophet just going back right in time and then bringing that back in a reality for us that it is a real happening that you can say i believe it everything that he has done remember god has always had a plan of redemption the prophet says he has always had a plan of redemption and that's been through the blood ever since the very beginning and the dawn of time perceived in the mind of god before the world ever came into existence now i want you to get this now he says that before this certain thing called the new birth ever happened to man he cannot no way at all understand or even understand god no man can understand god i don't care who you are in the natural sense no way at all understand or even understand god or have any knowledge of god though the word speaks it his mind cannot comprehend it because it's a human mind so you can sit under the word for 100 years and you will still not understand god because the human mind cannot comprehend it he's got to have the mind of god in him to understand godly things all the reading all the school all the teaching as good as that may be yet it's not the real principle yet amen he says because we cannot even interpret one another's mind amen i can look at your brother like i know what you're thinking you're smiling yeah yeah so i'm starting to think what can you think i'm trying to interpret you cannot tell me what i'm thinking right now amen i'm thinking brother andy's got a nice jacket on you would never have thought that so what is the principle you cannot interpret another human's mind now imagine you're trying to interpret god's mind with that same mind that you have this morning that god has blessed you that you can walk and talk and worship god from in the body but there's no interpretation from that principle and that's why it is an important foundation to really understand the principle that god works from amen god interprets his own mind now let's go to jeremiah 29 from verse 1 just as a background you see the way that god operates jeremiah 29 1 it's a letter that jeremiah sent written to those that were in exile taken away into babylon captivity now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives and to the priest and to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon after that joking the king and the queen and the eunuchs and the princes of judah and jerusalem and the carpenters and the smiths were departed from jerusalem by the hand of elisha the son of safram and gerema the son of hillary whom zedekiah the king of judah went unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all that are carried away captive whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem and to babylon so what is god telling them is telling them i have caused you to be taken captive because remember we sitting in situations and your mind that where does the devil work amen so you're sitting there and things happen to you and while things happen there's another preacher that comes which is called the devil and he's a good preacher don't underestimate him he can tell you things which sounds reasonable amen so he says thus save the lord the god of israel and to all that i carried away captive whom i of course to be carried away from so god makes it sure that they understand is not your own doing it's not this or that it is me that has done the following because it places it things in order it places in the right perspective because once you get the right perspective it takes pressure from you now look what it tells them in captivity in their current situation birdy houses dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them amen take your wives and begot sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that you may be increased there and not diminished and seek the peace of the city where the i have caused you to be carried away and pray unto the lord for it for in the peace thereof shall you have peace it is a wisdom a principle from god yeah you know what would we do we would say manly i'm captive yeah i'm not i don't want to be here they've captured me against my will i'll fight them every day i'll fight them i'll fight the government i'll fight every organization i'll fight every because i i'm not from here i'm going to heaven but god says why are you here pray for the government pray for your city pray for the people because the peace that you pray down is your blessing it is your blessing don't think i'm gonna be a vigilante man i'll become an underground movement i'll fight every unevil spirit in the end time man i'll show you by blood because even when jesus called his disciples he called different ones he didn't call them all out of the same church thinking the same man having the same attitude if i would call my deacons and trustees i want them all to think like me and that will make my life easy [Laughter] if i say we're going left they say amen you know and so we do but no jesus he called a tax collector yeah man i would never call a tax collector because everybody hates a tax collector and then he calls another one simon the zealot next to him now simon the zealot was a vigilante he was a killer a murderer of the roman system they believed god gave us the right to kill every room now the tax collector and the simon sitting next to other next to jesus so when jesus says you pay taxes matthew says amen amen and so you can see the dynamics that's why when god calls the church together we are each one different and unique in the right sense because god wants us to be that way he doesn't want us all to be the same he wants us all to be the same in loving him but in your own natural way to be an expression some of us can be quiet some others can be expressive some of us can be this and that but god calls us together as a family so we pray for those things god tells them to pray for that city where i have pleased you yes because their peace will be your blessing amen now he says verse 2 verse 8 for thus have the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which you cause to be dream for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them say of the lord for thus say of the lord that this that after 70 years be accomplished that babylon i will visit you and perform my good work towards you in causing you to return to this place so what was happening there was prophets and people coming up to say man we're going to take over this country we're going to overthrow this we're going to do this you know god is going to deliver us very soon and that caused them to have the wrong perspective of what they are busy doing yeah that's why if somebody comes and say man uh the rapture is upon us let's sell everything we have right and let's go and live on a mountain for for a year or two it is the wrong perspective because that's not what god gave us he says you plant your potatoes every day of your life because when the rapture comes some of you yours gonna be at work he says there's two in the field i'll take one i'll leave one it doesn't say all of you will be isolated on a mountain he says you will be where is he working laying floors or painting a wall then the rapture will happen so we gonna work until jesus comes naturally and spiritually it's never going to stop amen but those false prophets false diviners came and they gave them another perspective now he says i will wait till my time is for food and when my time is fulfilled then i will take you back to that land i remember when we were saved 30 years back god came in our lives in a mighty way and we were just saved and baptized and sat in the church and i said to sister it was a man we just made it i can't believe that god just waited for me because i can see the rapture is upon us and it was true but that's already 30 years back but today i'm glad god waited because after me many souls were added to the same body of christ don't be selfish don't think it's about you it's about the body of christ if we must mate another 100 years we wait if it's tomorrow we are happy if it's after tomorrow we're also happy but let's have that right attitude to say lord not upon my will but your will be done when the last one comes in the body is complete then we're going home so the fact that we're here this morning means the body is not complete that's all so we are patiently waiting looking for the last one i thought i was the last one but i was wrong imagine if i was the last one many of you would not be safe this morning that would have been terrible but god says no i know my own yes and we have to wait patiently patiently upon god yes amen and so the devil comes and he tries to influence our minds to push us away then look at the conclusion he says in verse 11 for i know the thoughts so he's comforting them with thoughts they are in exile they're under pressure they are rejected but i know the thoughts that i think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end amen so god's thoughts never changes so there's a constant divine flow of thoughts from god's mind to us as a church it never stops it is permanent amen as the psalmist says i am poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon me amen so it's a constant yielding of of thoughts now the people in judah were under pressure they were under under under some danger because when false things comes your way it creates danger amen the first one they were they were kept afloat by false hopes right people were telling them man don't worry the rapture is next week just just hold on or giving them certain things which wasn't from the mind of god but those gave them some some hope which was not a correct hope your hope your faith must be based upon the word of god not upon what somebody promised you or can deliver to you or you know if i can just wait another month i'm gonna hang on there because then i'll make it it's not about you hanging on it's about god holding you it is not you hanging on it's god having you so that first one was the false hopes created by those false prophets and the second danger was to go in total despair yeah that's the dangers we are you're either going to hang on to false hopes or you're going to go into total despair to say no i can't take it anymore i can't live i can't do this anymore i'm sick and tired of this life you know that false despair that comes upon you but then in the midst of that there's a reality the mind of god is the sustaining power that that revelation amen but god says to them in the that's why he explains to them the false prophets the things that they are not doing and then he says but i've thought towards you because when you start to think about the thoughts of god it gives you stability it gives you strength it gives you something on the internal and you cannot think about the thought of god with your own mind because your own mind will deceive you you have to go to the word of god and to say what are these thoughts that god thinks towards me amen you cannot do it otherwise so we are not to live in the false hopes of the world all the false hopes that we ourselves devise we many times like to devise false hopes for ourselves don't live on that because it's temporal you have to live upon a reality the only sustaining power is the word of god those thoughts that he revealed to us amen because we can in despair in trials of loneliness trials of of of rejection and many things we are exposed to so what are false hopes false hopes and things like my works will save me man i'm gonna work just a little harder than i feel better yeah your works can never save you you can work every day of your life for the kingdom of god it does not make you saved you are saved by grace and by grace alone nothing else can save you amen another fault hope is my church will save me a church can never save you a church is a safe haven it's a place where we congregate together it is important to have a home church but the church does not save you jesus christ save you and then he places you upon a body that you can be a benefit to that body amen false teachings that creates false expectations is a problem that people hang on to people that they hang on to if you hang on to a person and that person die you in trouble yeah that's right imagine here's the followers of the message yeah i wasn't in the message then when the prophet died but imagine you were a follower of this message and yeah the news comes the prophet is dead the devastation if you listen to those testimonies they were so convinced that god is gonna raise him from the dead yeah they actually postponed the burial they did many you know you can read between the lines how they how they how they tried and had their own interpretations and because how is it possible that god can take the last prophet of the earth how is it possible the mind cannot understand it i cannot even understand it because i would have loved him to be still alive today oh yeah because i will if i've got a question i'll pick up the phone and send her what's up i've got this dream i've got this question i'll tap into that source because it was for me it was a blessing a gift for me i will use it to the fullest right i won't be ashamed i won't no i'll be there i'll be you know but god then says this is the line and he takes him off the scene now those people that were heavily dependent upon him now he's shaken shaken to the roots to say but what's going to happen to the message now how is it going to go they could not understand but here we are many many years later and that same word is still alive moving forward because it's not a man-made system it is from the throne of god to you it would have died so many years back when the prophet died in 65 it would have been finished that's right but that's when it started to spread across the world that's where the power then became because he decreased and now jesus increased in our lives because if the prophet was still here today we would have focused on the wrong thing amen so god brings the man like john on the scene he delivers the word identifies the word and then he takes him off because he doesn't walk with two of them at the same time amen so you can see the mind of god our mind would they say lord keep him alive till the rapture we need it we need jesus christ in our lives we need the mind of god in our lives amen ephesians 1 from verse 9 ephesians chapter 1 from verse 9 the mind of god ephesians chapter 1 verse 9 we can see that god has got away having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which you have purposed in himself verse 10. that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ both which were in heaven and which on earth even in him in water we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him work all things after the council of his own will amen so god has got a council yeah and his council is his mind his will the thoughts that he had he always goes back to that he never forgets that when moses and them were in trouble after 400 years the burning bush came along and met moses and says i have remembered the promise that i made to my people that i will not forget about them amen his counsel of his own will now god is ever conscious of his thoughts against me and you the thoughts that he thinks about you is ever conscious of those thoughts we are always before his mind he never ceases to think about us his thoughts are so much higher than the thoughts we have and he's got all these promises that we can understand now the experiences of god's people in babylon made them think that the lord has forgotten to be mindful of them because how you want to tell me god is mindful of me when he exiled me he took me from my homeland he dropped me from my children he did this and that to me you want to tell me that's the mindfulness of god i cannot understand it that's why your mind is an enemy because our mindfulness is put him in a glass box lock the door no harm no evil no summer no winter everything perfect no problems nothing no diseases no nothing that's mindful of god that i like i like god to be mindful of me that nothing ever happens to me that i'm perfect you know and everything is just fine and no problems no diseases no no test no trials it is that's the mindfulness that i like as a human because if i'm blessed of the lord nothing must happen to me if i am the child the chosen of the king i must walk like the king and nothing must touch me but there says god says i'm mindful of you yet he has put them in exile i am mindful of you yet they are under pressure i am mindful of you yet they are not where they want to be they cry every day lord take us back but he says i am mindful of you because i've got thoughts of peace towards you peace towards you how is that peace when i'm in exile how is that peace when i am here living in 2022 in an ungodly godly places among ungodly people how is that mindful but god says i am mindful of you i have not forgotten about you amen amen they were acts out from their land of promise how could these events indicate that god thought about them in kindness you see already your mind cannot comprehend that that's why i'm saying this morning if you can just realize that that my mind cannot comprehend god's kindness because i've got a human kindness and i've got a godly kindness i've got a human peace and i've got a godly peace it's two different things you cannot even compare them amen and they were tempted to ask that did god care at all for me it's temptations that come our way did god forget about me did he forget about me psalms 139 verse 17 psalms 139 verse 17 he says how precious also are thy thoughts unto me now it's an expression how precious are they thoughts unto me how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more than the number of the sand when i'm awake i am still with thee so god's thoughts to you as an individual is more than the sands of the sea that's billions upon billions upon billions of thoughts for you it's precious it's something that he thinks about you just to know that he knows about me brings her peace so what does this mind of god in you produces because remember if paul says have the mind of god inside of you it must produce results if i have the mind of einstein i will do mathematical things for you this morning i will open the blackboard and i'll start to write x y z and we will do math because i can only but express what's in my mind yeah and so if i was a teacher a music teacher i'll move behind the drums i'll say look at the f this is f this is c this is b move from here there because this will pull me because it's in my mind so that's the same thing he says with god when the mind of god comes into you what does it produce what does it what does it bring forth the mind of god in you is not there to make you an intellectual genius on the message it's not there to make you a quota of the message it's not there to give you intellectual knowledge of the seven seals and seven thunders it's there to give you a life in victory amen so the mind of christ brings things to us the first thing that it does it's a mind of sacrifice the mind of christ brings sacrifices that you are willing to sacrifice your own ideas that you are willing to lay down your own ideas to say that is my own ideas does not count anymore but it's a sacrifice that's why roman says your body is a living sacrifice you can only do that if you have the mind of god if you don't have the mind of god you will never become a living sacrifice because you will hang on to your own ideas you will not sacrifice next thing he says the mind of christ brings a mind of humility to be humble to be humbled above everything let's go to luke chapter 14 verse 8 because remember james says humble yourself in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up a believer that has the mind of christ is not fighting for position i don't want to fight for my position because when god gives me my position it's an eternal position amen when god places me in the church nobody can place me out you know when somebody places you in another man will places you out but when god places you it's eternal into heavenly places luke chapter 14 verse 8 he says when they are arbited of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room amen so when you are caught you want to sit at the main table is that right because that shows your importance when you walk into a venue you look for the best seat in the house and you go and plant yourself there because i'm a son of the king no he says when you go to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be burdened of him and he that bathed thee and him come and say to thee give this man place that thou began with shame to take the lowest room so imagine how embarrassed that is you move to the main table brother and paul and the guest of honor comes and he taps you on the shoulder you know come come sit at the back there there's yours so you moved up with proud and arrogancy but when you move down you move down with humility you've been humbled because the main man doesn't see you fit for the big table he says that's the human character the human character always wants to be somebody special yeah man if they can just appreciate me for what i can do for this church and the ability i can bring you know all those mind thoughts there were places in us amen now in verse 10 he says but when they are buried go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that paid thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher then shall i have worship in the presence of them that sit and meet with thee for whomsoever ever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humble himself shall be exalted amen that's why the prophet says eternal life is to live for others so if you ever want to please god humble yourself don't lift yourself up see how humble you can become because then god will lift you up the mind of christ brings a mind of obedience so you can start to see if i have the holy ghost the mind of christ i will be a sacrificial life i will be a faithful life i will be obedience a life of obedience to the word of god amen because that is how the scriptures teach us because it brings obedience because unbelief will always misinterpret the act of god unbelief will always see the act of god as a punishment as a problem as something but faith says amen to every word amen faith believes the word of god faith brings it to the reality that we can understand the principles of god 1 peter 4 verse 1. is that the rain coming down thank god for rain one peter 4 was one for as much then as christ have suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that suffered in the flesh have seen from sin that he no longer should live with the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of god so if your flesh is still ruling you you have not armed yourself with the mind of god he says arm yourself which then means the mind of god is a weapon a weapon of mass destruction a weapon that can con that can defeat any demon it is arm yourself with that mind so if the enemy comes because if you arm yourself with the mind and the flesh rises up you can fight him you can put him in its place because the mind of christ then becomes the ruler in your heart so the mind is a weapon arm yourself not with your own mind but with the mind of christ because when you're in trouble then your reference becomes the word what does the word say about this because remember the word is the mind of christ amen the word is every thought that god put down for us he says those words were written from the mind of god it becomes word and then he puts it down in the bible isaiah 26 3 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon thee because he trusteth in thee so if you've put your mind to trust in god he says you will have perfect peace perfect peace in the midst of trouble in the midst of disaster you will have perfect peace amen but now as god is eternal the prophet says and he was the perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect joy perfect satisfaction all those seven spirits as we get in revelation they came out was made up of god was perfection everything else outside of that has been something that's been perverted now the only way that we can come back to perfection is to come back with that perfection which is god then we come to perfection then we have eternal life without ant without anything it's just forever eternal life amen so that's why he says no weapon formed against you will prosper because you've got an arm that you've armed yourself with you've got a weapon that you armed yourself with which is the mind of god so if the nep forms a weapon against you you fight him with that armor that you've got which the mind of god is an important part of because you can then discern him and look at all these things that he brings up against us so what kind of a piece are we talking about we're not talking about a piece that there's no problems yeah that's right right you've got a man-made piece every year they sign peace treaties man the world governments come together all the big presidents of every big major nation come together they sit in a room they argue their reason and when they leave they sign a peace treaty and when they go back is there peace no everybody feels better because there's a peace treaty but there's no peace because it's a man-made peace a man made peace can never bring peace but he says you as a child of god will have peace amongst the greatest trouble you will have peace in your heart you will have peace in your mind you will be peaceful thank you you will have problems but you will be at peace now that's a paradox that's the mind of god amen why is that because the bible says christ made peace for you he made peace colossians colossians 1 20 and having made peace through the blood of his cross so there was no peace for you i'm not talking worldly peace i'm talking godly peace he says but jesus made peace when he died on the cross he paid for peace peace that you know if whatever happens to me my footsteps are for ordained of the lord nothing can happen to me that god has not allowed not even a hair from my head can drop to the ground because god is my god i belong to him he bought me on the cross when satan comes to me there's a big board on me on my head here you can't see it but it's there bought by the blood property of jesus christ the way i walk i'm not my own i have lost my own ability i've lost my own mind i belong to jesus christ and when i walk down the street the enemy can look at me and say here comes another one yeah and now he wants to attack me yeah i can't come to brother and porn just take his car keys and disappear and come back in the months time before i go to south africa i say yes your car brother he will say to me how did you manage to take it you never asked me now i had to suffer without my car you know we had to go on the train and the bus and this and that luckily the buses are working here but it's still an inconvenience where we come from the buses are always on time is that right brother-in-law not anyway so i need permission because the car does not belong to me it belongs to brother and paul and if you don't belong to the devil but you belong to jesus christ who has he asked permission to come and attack you he has to ask the lord the owner and the owner looks at every petition and he grants certain certain certain acknowledgement he grants it and permissions but they're all restricted because i don't belong to myself i belong to him and he is the owner and nobody can touch me until the owner says yes it brings peace i'm at peace whatever happens to me there's a great god that has allowed it and he says i will never test you about what you can endure i will never destroy you but i'll make you peaceful ephesians says christ preached peace upon us he came and he preached peace to you which were afar of unto them which were nigh so he died for peace on the cross his word being preached is another form of peace another one he says he gives peace in john 14 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth i give unto you so he clearly stated don't look for worldly peace don't look for a perfect world yet there is no perfect world here look for the perfect word in your life and that will bring perfection that will bring peace to know you know what this world is full of trouble a peace above worldly peace a peace that i can become and know that my god is in control even in the face of death amen and then he says in ephesians for christ is our peace when you have christ you have peace because he is the author of peace amen jeremiah 6 14 because the world says and the bible warns us when they say peace be sudden destruction will be upon them jeremiah 6 14 they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly have you ever heard that they have heard they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly and saying to them because the hurt of the slight healing comes from saying peace peace when there is no peace i don't want a man to tell me this peace yeah i don't want to tell a man to tell me i'm on my way to heaven when i'm not right i don't want a man to appease me i want the word to be straight with me to tell me repent or perish to tell me exactly what he expects of me because that brings peace so god rebukes them here to say you have tried to heal the people slightly right because if you come to me with a problem and i'll tell you and i give you some soft story which is not true it will bring slight relief it will bring a little bit of relief that you will go away and feel a little bit better but guess what tomorrow the problem is still there god is not like that when god comes and he heals you he takes the problem away he relieves it he heals you he delivers you of every demon i don't care what attraction or addiction or whatever comes your way god can deliver you of all of them completely that's right not halfway completely but this peace that jeremiah speaks of it is a piece of ignorance ignorance many times message people they become ignorant of the reality of life of the reality of the word of god of all these things and they want this this is this artificial peace don't look for peace in that sense look for the word of god in manifestation in my life because the greater the word manifest the greater the enemy will attack you the more problems you will have right it's true every time i make a testimony at churches the elder tells me afterwards oh why did you do that because from monday there's trouble we fight we argue we struck not against each other but against the enemy then you know he's behind you because you made a public testimony that i am full of peace i've got the peace of the lord and then monday morning the devil is there to take that peace out of you amen so it's an important principle but that gives you character it gives you the ability to show i am more than able through jesus christ my lord to face every trial every test so there's a piece of ignorance amen that you just ignore the facts and think everything is fine don't be in that peace there's a piece of stagnation where the waters are so calm yeah man it's so wonderful it is so blessed but that calm waters what does it create stagnation brings all kinds of evil things lizards snakes everything that you don't want because there's a stagnation yeah that's why the waters of the world needs to move upon the water so that it can shake it up that it can throw all the dross on the side and that's the principle that god uses but we think man god has blessed me i'm it's so peaceful around me no it's not a p it's not a sign that everything is fine yeah it's a sign that you're in trouble a sign that you must start to pray say lord just shake me up a bit amen but we don't want to pray like that because we don't have the mind of god because the bible says jesus learned obedience by what oh i thought the things that didn't happen to you so if jesus had to learn obedience what about you him being the full manifested son of god he learned obedience by the things he suffered and i guess what you can add your name to that to say lord my name is included in there i have learned obedience with every tribe every suffering every shake-up of the tree i've learned to be obedient that's how god works i don't care where we live what we do that is the same principle god knows how to shake us how to move with us then there's a peace an imperfect piece of dependence amen we depend on a person it's an imperfect peace because if you depend on a person that person is going to die if the lord doesn't come that's right then your peace has also died with that person my peace is in jesus christ who rose from the dead who can never die again i don't care what happens what satan brings he is the king of king the author of life so my peace is an eternal peace amen it's perfect that's right in the in the midst of the storm it is perfect now we all know the story about the prophet and the bull yeah it's one of those famous message things that happened to the prophet for us to teach us a lesson every day and you can look at it from different angles and different ways but you can just do other lord engineers in life yeah the lord has engineered your life yes he allows things and he does things that to to bring us to a position so he goes and he's going to pray for the sick sister and as he comes he parks his his little bucky or you to what you call it and he gets out he leaves his gun yeah we call it the bucky i know when i said the bucky nobody knew what i was talking about so they corrected me a few weeks back so here's the the he puts his gun on the seat jumps over the fence and here he goes and now he comes to the middle of the of the of the camp and all of a sudden he sees a big animal laying there a bull and he realized mice the killer bull that killed somebody last week so now you can see god has taken away the gun now all of a sudden the bull also sees the prophet now the bull ma maybe on his mind he still had that fresh impression of what he did last week and he's so anointed of the devil and so on and he jumps up now what does the prophet do he does what every one of us does go to our own human ability yeah that's right he never fell on his knees raise his hand and say oh lord jesus be merciful to me first thing he goes for the gun because if he had his gun he would have shot the bull yeah and he would have paid back the owner your life is more than the bull so he realized the gun is not there then the next thing he says i was looking for a tree and god made it that in that camp there's no tree before the foundation of the world because there's no con incident it is not just a haphazard happening it is god's mind engineering the circumstances to bring to me and you the reality of the god that we serve now he looks for a tree and he says there's no tree and then the next thing he looks for the fence he says the fence is too far i don't god didn't make him a hundred meter sprinter because he could not outrun the bull yeah and he says no i'm in trouble and the bull gets up and the bull gets excited and he says the bull drops his head and here he comes now look at what he says and here he comes well he's got perhaps within 20 yards no need of trying to run you couldn't run anywhere no push three to get into you just have to stand and face it that's all so he just decided now i'm gonna face it and something happened instead of hating the bull or wanting to kill it a perfect piece settles him can you see how powerful that piece is if i don't say an angel appeared to stand between me and the bull no he said perfect peace came and settled where yeah amen perfect peace in the face of uncoming certain death not perhaps not maybe the man the bull at the track record he's a killer so the bull coming he says a perfect piece settled down and i thought look how he changed his thoughts as we saw now earlier the perfect piece is linked to the mind of god so yeah perfect peace settled and immediately his thoughts changed from before country just that now he says and i thought i disturbed the poor fellow and the bull is still coming yeah now he's not worried about the bull coming his thoughts has now changed and he says my i destruct the poor fellow and when he got coming to me real close i said now i'm sorry i disturbed you he's apologizing to the book perfect peace i am the servant of the lord and i charge thee in the name of the lord jesus christ our creator that you go over there and lay down and here comes the bull coming right on but samuel i wasn't a bit afraid then i'm right here before lovely christians he got within about 10 feet of where i was standing and i just stood there looking at him not a more afraid than i am of this meek looking little lady sitting here looking at me and he ran right to me when he got right up close to me he just throwed out he just throwed out his feet and stopped and he looked this way and he looked this way can you imagine and he looked away so depleted and he turned around walked over and go and lay down under that little bush he says what happened what did that bull experience if you think about it yeah because both of them had no experiences the prophet had an experience and the bulleted experience because the prophet says everything that comes close into the presence of god has got an experience even when the devil came to kill jesus on the cross he had an experience yes he did he says nothing can be the same when they come into the presence of god you're either closer to god or you're further away from god the maturity of the seed in your heart if you are a true seed you are closer to god if not you are farther away because the word matures amen so he says the bull must have experienced an adopted son there was an atmosphere the bull must have experienced adam again because remember the creation is groaning for the manifestation of the son of god and all of a sudden the bull comes into an atmosphere and in his mind he must have gone back and said here's adam my creator my ruler my king and he can never touch his end creator and the prophet must have experienced perfect peace to apologize to the bull he spoke like adam spoke to them yes amen so that bull must have heard that same voice that said to him peace tree move here wind stop it's the creator that adam condition that god is bringing us because he says you are an atmosphere creator and that's why it's so important to have that mind of god but if you don't have that you can never do these things you can never come to that full maturity that's why it's so important to have that mind of god the baptism of the holy spirit the revelation and the growth in jesus christ amen so that obedience was upon him because he comes to that principle to say you know what the mind of god brings you to an obedience brings you to a point where you realize god is god the prophet is when you come to total obedience then you can have possession but until you totally obey you've got to completely surrender your own thoughts your own world your own mind and let the mind of christ operate in you the bible you cannot say the bible is right in some places and not in others the mind of christ would sanction every word of christ and say amen every word of christ that's right not some those that you like you can get excited thank you jesus those that you don't like every word is an amen not some not the ones i like if i don't like it i can still say amen as long as it's written in the bible i say amen to every word doesn't matter if it hurts me it doesn't matter if it blesses me i say amen that's the mind of god hallelujah now here comes a woman she's got a sick child jesus is busy with an important meeting with the disciples she comes from the site and she says oh son of david master as she approaches him but she calls him constantly peter says lord sander a wage is disturbing us because peter already said no the lord is ignoring her so he felt he can also ignore her so all right he says lord send that away now they imagine though they talking about her she's present they're talking about you how do you like people talking about you yeah i don't like it you hear from the grapevine you know that one said this about you and it hurts you you think my how can they say that about me now imagine people talking about you and you're standing next to them wow yeah and that's that's that's strong now she hears him say yeah peter you're right you know what uh i'm not sent to the dogs i cannot give her the bread of the children i cannot do these things now he's calling her names yeah he's calling her first he ignores her then he calls her names and so you can start to see the magnitude of that test now rising up but she had a deep desire in her and she made a decision that whatever he says is right right i don't care what he says i need something from him and for me to receive i has to deny myself and say amen to every word and when he says she's a dog what does she say amen which means it's true which means it's true lord she knew he cannot lie if he calls me a dog then i say amen she says amen i'm a dog but lord the dogs can eat the crumbs that fall from the table he turns to and says my daughter is he'll come without a prayer without anything she pulled right from heaven right through him what he needed because she was willing to say amen to every word we must be willing to say amen to every word every quote everything that god delivers don't try and reason it don't even try to understand it amen because there's many things you will never understand according to the prophet revelation is the important part by faith because remember if you understand everything you don't need faith that's right it's true if you know the message from a to z you don't need faith but he says there's certain things that you need to believe by faith how is it going to happen i don't know but i believe it when is it going to happen i don't know but i believe it's going to happen all those things like the date for the rapture is by faith if it comes tomorrow we'll be ready is that true that's fine let's say the lord's coming tomorrow 12 o'clock who's going to pack his van tomorrow to go to work [Laughter] amen no we will say lani just make me a nice breakfast i'm not going to work today you know the lord's coming at 12 i'm gonna not waste my time on the job but the prophet says if you know the lord's coming you go that morning you plant your potatoes as if you're gonna harvest that's the christian attitude that's the way we live is not based upon time your life has been changed completely and therefore it's a life style that comes now it's not based upon anything else so that woman called the dog she understood and she said amen and the amen produced the result amen so we have it brings also the mind of obedience when you have the mind of christ it brings the mind of obedience to say amen to every word because what god was he brought into christ and what christ was he brought into the church is that right he's brass produced that now he says in plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally through though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body that's the bright is the literal spoken word seed bride that's right so you are the literal spoken word seed bright that's right that way in the mind of god that was spoken into creation and in the right time and season god found you amen in this very time that you live in so she was predestinated amen he says we did not become seed by rebirth we were seated and therefore were reborn for only elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened non-seed there is nothing to be quickened if there were no seed inside of you you would cannot be quickened so the fact that you can see and understand by revelation the word of god is the greatest blessing that you will ever have that's why the prophet says there's only one way you know god loves you he gave me a nice job he gave me a big business he gave me a big car he gave me the no only reason you can know he loves you is by election yeah the fact that he elected you is proof that he loves you whatever happens after that is by god's grace whatever he seems fit for me is by his grace amen because it's a principle that we have to understand amen amen now he says when they were traveling in the old testament all of a sudden they did things wrong serpents came and started to bite them some died burnt like fire the bible says they were under pressure now they cried to god and god makes a way for them he says and god says to moses make a paul put a snake upon it and if they look upon that they live so he presents something to them now the prophet says the paul represented the cross everything represented christ why did he foreshadow that god in the beginning he was only letting the children of israel draw interest and what he was going to do so here he comes with a beautiful principle that in the mind of god jesus was crucified before the foundation of the world did it happen exactly because god's minds are eternal his thoughts are eternal so here he comes and they're in trouble and he produces something that must happen two thousand years later produce a stick with a snake and they starting to draw interest on something that must happen later i want you to follow that in the mind of god christ was already crucified for he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world back in eden christ in god's thoughts which became his word had not materialized yet but he knew it was what he had promised it and he let the children of israel draw interest before the deposit was made amen amen amen draw interest i've never seen that before every bank wants you to deposit money yeah and then you can draw interest right but the bank of god doesn't work like that he says you can draw interest on a deposit that has not been made yet when they were there jesus christ was gonna die and they got the healing before he even died what about you and me after the deposit has been made how much more can you come to that bank and say lord i need something today the deposit has been made everything is placed there you can take it if you want it it's a principle if they can draw interest before the deposit my the prophet says how is it possible that you cannot draw interest if the deposit is already made they could come and say the deposit is not there but i'm drawing on the future prospects you don't have to come like that you can come and say lord it is done it is finished the word declares it i'm coming to a deposited bank every promise is there everything i need is that i'm drawing i believe amen for my protection for my provision for my healing amen amen because i'm coming there it must be a principle now listen to what he says here and then he handed it down his knowledge to the prophets and they wrote it out and year by year and century of the century we see it coming to pass exactly god giving us a shadow of the old force foreshadowing the new and we see it word by word being fulfilled what a faith we ought to have established in god he says you as a believer here your faith ought to be established this morning because you've got no excuse you have seen what god has done in your day you have even seen from the very first from adam right till today what god has done he says that's there for you to be established to know what god is capable of to understand and believe it by faith and to say lord i believe it amen it's done yes i'm coming to draw interest on what has been done for me i'm a son of god i have dominion this earth has been given to us he says like adam was a controller a god to this earth so you'll be a ruler a judge but my faith needs to be established amen because how are you going to rule if your faith is not established how are you going to judge if your faith is not established because remember he says you're gonna judge with him yes right now it's easy to say man that's a wonderful thought but just think about it let's say it's now the great white throne judgment and you're standing on that side of the judge next to him yeah and now if somebody comes up and the lord turns you and say you judge the case wow think about it wow the reality of it the consequences of it that you're gonna tell this person heaven or hell then it becomes a fearful thing then it becomes the reality is now weighing up on your hands to say man what i'm doing now is going to be life or death then it's no more quotes flying around and one brother cutting the other brother and one church against the other church then it's life or death and you must know where you're standing you must have the mind of god and you must act like it was god himself standing there judging rightfully so where do we start with that we start here not in the millennium not at the end he says here you start to live godly here you start to exercise your faith here you start to be a son of god not waiting for the heavens heaven we're gonna be but you'll have no trial or no test in heaven that's why he says here the life is where you live years where you gain your experiences you will gain new experiences in heaven because you'll be complete your character you'll take with you he says your character is not formed in heaven it's formed here that's why every test every trial you should you should look at it like god it's not a burden it's not a it's not a shame it's not something that god is punishing you it is gold to me as a son of god it's gold to me he could have left me and i would have no testimony but now we can call up anybody and they'll have something to say you know i was in trouble god did this for me i was down deep in the mud god pulled me out i was lost but he saved me i was weak but he made me strong i was lost but he found me and this testimony upon testimony that's why when you come into heaven the angels will like to know what happened how did this come and everyone will have a test the angels has got no testimony like you that's why you are a son and daughter of god amen says heavens will sing when you enter because there's an expression there's a life and we can draw interest from what god has done but how what's the problem we don't have the mind of god so here's the bank now you're coming you've got banks in new zealand was everything online you know you're such a first world country i'm not sure what has allowed you and what not but by us we've got banks you stand in it in a queue so let's say you go to the bank and you're gonna come and you're gonna draw from the deposit you know there's a million round of million dollars of interest already in your account i'm gonna draw just just a hundred dollars i just need a hundred dollars this morning so when you come through the door how do you come i don't know some of us come like this you know looking around coming to the lady at the tower ah and then you said sorry sorry i'm sorry to disturb you i hope you can help me yes what can i do oh i'm sorry can i come back later you know you're so scared you're so uncertain of yourself so unsure you're so and she says man don't waste my time you know and so you stand and say oh i'm sorry i just want you to check for me this is my account number here can you just check if there's something for me there and i just love if you can help me please can you just give me a hundred if it's too much give me five you know you're so apologetic you're so uncertain you you there's no there's no certainty there's no i'm not talking arrogancy yeah i'm talking certain certainty to know who you are certainty to understand and stand your position certainty to know i'm a son and daughter of god redeemed by the blood a certainty today i'm not coming in my own name i'm coming in the name of jesus christ i'm not coming here because of what i have done but what he has done for me i'm not going to ask excuses for when i come i'm coming with boldness to you not with arrogance so how do you walk in as a son of god the daughter of god you come in good morning good morning god bless you how are you this morning you are happy you're excited because you've got a certainty that the deposit is made my interest is guaranteed nothing can take it from me you don't worry if it's there or not you know it's there by faith you know my god cannot lie so when you come to the lady she might have a bad day yeah she might treat your root it's got nothing to do with it her rudeness is not dependent upon my blessing her rootness is not gonna diminish my blessing i can just come and say i need my hundred dollars and make it quickly [Laughter] and she can't argue she can't reason she might feel bad she might feel sad she has to deliver that promise and it's the same with us when you come to god come with the certainty to know the deposit is made the interest is there for me when i need it i can walk in there and i can just collect it because god has done it if they can do it on a pre-deposit i can do it after a deposit it's certain because it's an unchanging god but your faith needs to be established amen he says the prophet says what a faith we ought to have established in god amen now the word established means having existed or done something for a long time how many times have you seen god move how many testimonies have you heard how many in your own life how many things has god done for you small things big things little things whatever it is there repeated time after time for you to have a faith established amen that you can stand with that boldness to say i know my god and i know him in the power of his resurrection and i know him in the strength of the ability that he can do it's an unfailing word hebrews 4 2. do we still have time you must tell me when my time is up thank you he wasn't sure if he must not or not not but he favored me when i look at you you just go like this and i know it's finished thank you it's still going okay so hebrews 4 verse 2 for unto us was the gospel preached amen as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that hurt it so you can sit under the true anointed word and it cannot profit you if your faith doesn't mix with that word not your own faith but god's faith inside of you to be mixed to be able to believe it to say lord i believe every word that's been preached so that word being preached did not profit them because it was not mixed with faith in them that hurt it now the prophet says my brethren let me stop here for a minute no matter how much the word is preached how well you like the way it's been preached unless you yourself are a partaker of that it won't do you any good not being mixed were faith by them that hurt it they've seen the miracles of moses they said that's pretty good and they walked over they seen him perform miracles they seen the pillar of fire maybe or heard them talk about it oh that's all right but it wasn't mixed with personal faith for as soon as they got in the wilderness they began to murmur and god says because they adopted it was sin don't doubt nothing believe don't help no matter how hard the case is believe it because the word preached can only profit you if you believe it if you don't believe it it cannot profit you now he says god showed them the purify he showed them signs and wonders he let them out he brought them into temptation to try and prove them amen so something will happen and then god will to prove you it happens like that let's think about job here's job a man of god a servant of god a prophet of god when his children have a party he goes and sacrifice in case they sin he was a believer of the blood sacrifice and he was real sincere and now there's a meeting in heaven and satan is found among the sons of god and god approaches him and says have you considered my servant job why does god do that because he wanted to give job a deeper understanding a deeper revelation and satan says yeah now i've looked at him but you have hedged him up what is a hedge god has put a fence around you no demon can come to you no devil no nothing because god says this is the fence i've built myself and satan saw the fence and satan knew i cannot touch him and god says fine i'll remove a part of the hedge a small part i'll remove you can do this do this but you cannot take his life god always puts the conditions down not just giving satan an open book amen he doesn't have any troubles he doesn't have any worries and god allowed it and opened it up the prophet says he doesn't have any worries he doesn't have any financial burdens everything is fine he doesn't have sickness any pain let me have him and i'll make him curse you to your face and god opened the hedge because god knew job will never curse him but it was for job's benefit it was not for any other one's benefit it was not for satan's to enjoy himself it was for god's benefit job's benefit amen even accusing him of a certain of a secret sinner amen and all the things that happened to him but at the end job came out stronger when the trial was finished job could rise from the airship and he was a stronger man than when he entered him every trial every test you enter when you come out on the other side you are stronger remember when you came into their word man i can remember maybe you are not like me but my when when something happens to me it upsets me me and my wife will go on we'll cry together how is this possible how can this happen to us a small thing and as you grow after that trial another trial comes and you don't realize but you become stronger now today if something like that happens to me it won't even touch me because it's such a small test i don't even see it sometimes because you have grown mature you've gone stronger and it's time goes so your tests increase as a baby comes in there's certain things aloud when he starts to walk he will fall but as he gets stronger and stronger god will allow more things and we must realize god is working in every life every one of us has got a trial a test something that we work with and god is working with us and bringing us to a stronger point so your test and trials is not there to destroy you it's not there to take faith from you it's not there to see how much punishment you can take it's there to make you stronger because after every test after every trial you come out stronger you come out more pure you come out closer to god because that's the way god purifies us that's why the prophet mentioned things finances sickness trials diseases you know no troubles worries he says those things comes upon us and god takes us through them but he makes us stronger every one of them makes us stronger amen because unto them the gospel was preached but it didn't profit them so the secret is faith is a gift of god your foundation because without faith it's impossible to please god you cannot do that so in closing the devil will always try to get you in a corner where is the greatest battle right here that's why paul many times in the bible mainly mentioned many times get the mind of god because that's the battleground you've got your own mind where satan has got access to you can sit in church and you can have an evil thought that's right you're not immune to that but the prophet says is what you do with that thought that makes the difference you must realize that's not my thought it's the enemy's thought and you ignore it you reject it just start to praise god if satan comes and attacks you in church and you sit there your mind start to wander you must realize this is a tactic of the enemy he places thoughts real thoughts about real problems that you face monday he's not he knows about your life he knows about the trials he knows about the situations and he will work on that he will give you something that's important to you and all of a sudden your mind starts to drift and you have to have the mind of god to say no but how do you do it the first thing you must shake the devil off and just by saying amen to the world not to satan amen not to those thoughts but to the word amen so if he comes again you give a louder amen amen there's a tactic behind it it's a way that you scare him yes it's a way even if you're not somebody that can say amen try it once amen when the enemy is upon you and he's trying to give you that thought just say amen and if we refuse to watch just go up our higher amen and if he still refused go amen and if he still refused stand up and clap your hands and say amen i'll guarantee you i guarantee you he will run he will sit down and you will be wide awake and you will excited and you will be happy and the devil will move away from me and you will focus on the word amen it's a principle that you must understand when it gets you in a corner there's a way out of the corner the battle is in the mind and even in church the battle continues satan also comes to church there's not a boat out there that says not allowed he doesn't care what boat you put up he even comes and sit next to you that's right you believe me oh yeah he does it yes in this building there's angels there's god but there's also the enemy because he's allowed if he's allowed in the throne room of god to come and talk he can go anywhere but his purpose is not yet to get you focused on the word his purpose is to distract you that's right so the mind of god then becomes a battlefield that's why he says arm yourself with the mind of god because when the enemy comes in the mind of god can raise up and say amen amen amen hallelujah thank you jesus and it becomes an expression amen remember when jesus was there and he was tempted he went out into the wilderness and the bible says he fasted 40 days he never got hungry he was just praying fasting for and after 40 days the bible says he became hungry when he became hungry who was the first one who appeared first one think about it the enemy himself where was the enemy all the time he was next to him he never bothered him on day one day 15 day 39 but on day 40 when he became weak he was dead when the devil says no he's weak right yeah he says yeah i am you know the bible where does it go bible bible bible he says the bible says if you're hungry you can speak to these stones and create bread that's how evil and how sly now he is that's why you have to have the mind of god because if you ever have the mind of god it will make sense and say yes amen i can create bread let me create it but it wasn't the season it wasn't the time for that scripture and he says depart from me because the bible also says men shall not live by bread alone remember jesus at the mind of god because everything that was in god was brought into him so one day he's coming there and he gets to the well and he sits there and he tells his disciples go buy food i'm very hungry you remember that and they all depart into town and he sits at the well but he's waiting for the woman at the world and when the woman of the well comes he deserves her he tells her her husband's situation and she runs back into the city and here comes the disciples with packs of food maybe chicken and chips and everything they had those days breads and so on and if they packed it then this master here's the food let's eat and all of a sudden he says i'm not hungry anymore they thought he had something else to eat while they were gone he says no meat for me is to do my father's work that to me feeds me more than any food that you can ever feed me that's the principle it is better than your food to do the work of the father to do the word of god so when he was fast at 40 days he became weak and then the enemy comes you need the mind of god to then fight him he will look at you when you're weak he will come and he will speak to you yeah start to talk to you not when you're on top of the mountain yeah he will leave you until you cool down because he knows you cannot be on the mountain forever there's no christian on the mountain forever you can run up and down the aisle you can be excited and we are excited but guess what somewhere in this journey you're going down into a valley and he waits for you down in the bottom of the valley he's waiting and when you arrive they start to tell you god don't love you god has left you you are on your own he doesn't care for you and then starts but the mind of god says then he says he never leave me no forsake he's an ever-present help in a time of trouble even if i don't feel him even if i don't see him i still believe that he cannot leave me i won't feel anything even if i see no miracle in my life i still believe in miracles even if i see no healing i still believe in healing that's the approach the mind of god expression amen so the devil will even use the word to confuse you and he will even use the message to confuse you the mind of god then brings clarity say no no no something is wrong here amen yes so if you go into the mind of god as the the word then declares when jesus when god spoke to job and he asked him the question where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy it's a good question where were you when the gods when the sons of god shouted for joy the prophet says job was in the mind of god as a son of god given the expression of rejoicing about what god has done so in the mind of god job was a was a servant and he was worshiping god now where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy you were also in the mind of god before there was time god saw you in the church and he saw you how you loved the word and he could see you raising your hand and say oh god i love you it's an expression yes gloria how did abel know how to bring the correct sacrifice a blood sacrifice by revelation amen where were you when jesus christ went to the cross when god says in my mind he's already crucified where were you you were in him hallelujah when he went to the cross you as the bride were in him that's why you went that walk with him into the cross where were you when the lamb's book of life was written ready it's already written your name is already in the book when was your name put down there before the foundation how did god do it because he saw you in his mind amen that's why you can never go lost when god wrote your name there you have got an eternal certainty that it's not him that will have no in the drama but god that give of grace amen amen amen so we can start to doubt our doubts we can start to really know that you know what is not up to me god has given me so much grace that i can look at him and say lord thank you for the mind of christ thank you that i don't have to depend on the canary brain that you've given me that i can ignore it and know it's so stupid it's so you know it can reason things and it can be upset about things but the mind of god has got a different approach so the greatest battle is in the mind and it's basically about your ideas versus god's mind amen your ideas versus the word of god because satan uses that channel to plant all kinds of things and you must just say put it through the word filter to say no the mind of god to me is important the mind of god to me gives me revelation it shows me my position it helps me to live a daily life godly dedicated to him that i can go from this place and know that i'm more than a conqueror i'm more than able to overcome every test of every trial amen because with our own mind you will hurt yourself remember that it's not me that said the prophet says you're gonna injure yourself with this mind so don't think like this think what how god would have done it think and pray and say lord give me inspiration give me guidance when i make decisions let me pray for your will let me pray for your mind to guide me because then i'll make the right decisions that i don't go in my own world and my own desires but that your will will guide me like the prophet had many desires one of his greatest desires was to go and live in the bush he says if i can just live in the bush and if god gives me a message i'll run out i'll deliver it and i'll run back it was his mind his desire but then god comes to me and says it's the wrong mind it's the wrong desire just because you'll end up totally deserted your wife won't even leave you yeah god knew that he says my mind for you is you're a prophet ordained for the end time you're gonna preach and you're gonna record every message because there's people coming that needs that word that was god's mind i am thankful for god's mind in the prophet that he didn't follow his own mind then we would never have a message but god is not dictated to and god doesn't listen to our mind thankfully you know he does his own thing and he will lead us he takes us as prisoners of love divine amen that he can say like paul says i'm a prisoner of jesus christ i'm a prisoner of love divine which means all my ideas has been taken away all my own thoughts my own desires i have surrendered to god yes and he is now in charge of me he decides where i go he decides when i go your footsteps of the righteous are for ordained of god and nothing can happen to you that god is not allowed not even a hair fall from your head that's how his thoughts are towards us that he knows everything about me he knows every he even knows what's going to happen till the day i die if he should tarry and if my name is written next to the rapture i will go in the rapture it's whatever god has planned and designed so it brings peace to know i'm not going to produce anything amen i'm going to walk by faith believing the word of god and that takes of pressure because it's not up to me because remember you're living in a world of pressure you know what's pressure-like at school you've got pressure at work you've got pressure you've got deadlines you've got so many pressures upon life and it's just adding and adding and adding and adding and the prophet says we live in a time where it's so difficult but it's spiritually it's the same thing there's pressure all around us but it's the mind of god in you that gives you the ability to handle that pressure to withstand that pressure because he's an equalizer he's a god that says in the time of trouble when the enemy comes in like a flood i'll raise up the standard of the word so what happens as the pressure goes on the outside in the inside where's the word it raises as well that's right so if the pressure on the outside goes to 100 bar and you feel you're going to explode just go to the scripture and say lord increase the word inside of me so if the pressure on the outside comes to 100 bar and the pressure on the inside comes to 100 bar what is the pressure zero you don't have to face anything that's right just get god to raise up the standard and you will be at peace the pressure will still be there the problem will still be there but now you're at peace because you've found the grace of god amen to live in a difficult circumstance the way that god wants you to live or because of the mind of god that's why paul says arm yourself use it as a weapon get something to fight this enemy with think like god with a thing that's why he says you are sons and daughters of god and that's why the prophet says the word is in the bride she knows what to do of the word she knows how to handle the word because of that principle the mind of god the word of god inside that little pride amen let's buy it lord as we bow in your presence today we are so thankful for your word for the revelation it brings for the understanding it brings in the stability amen that lord doesn't matter what happens to us oh lord there is always a certainty that god is in control when we come to thee of father god we ask thee that you will be gracious unto everyone here this morning that you all father god help us to understand that the mind of god has been delivered by your word that we have a clarity by the baptism of the holy spirit in our lives to walk this life that when the enemy comes oh god let us not become despondent or run to our own means but that we always turn to thee to say oh god my help comes from the lord the one who created the heavens and the earth lord i pray for every brother every sister every child in this building may you give us the grace and the understanding of god to raise up to the occasion to face the enemy and to know oh god we are more

man he's wonderful isn't he amen you can have your seats and uh sister sepi's got a testimonies you'd like to share so god bless you god bless you saints [Music] about a few weeks ago i came for prayer what happened was i think 2018 as we arrived one of the welcome pegs included a sun fly biting my neck and i think it bit a little bit too high so the skin went deeper on the inside then the dead cells started gathering together in that hole that it formed and then it became quite a huge cyst in there and out of the blue all of a sudden it started being painful but what happened was i was sharing with her sister on a saturday morning and she had a problem with her neck i said to her we'll pray together then i went to go light and when i woke up my neck was extremely so i couldn't and i could not do anything then i found that the cyst was very much inflamed then i i came for prayer on the sunday i remember after service the pastor said to me you know what while i was praying for you i felt something then i said to you thank you and the monday i tried booking the appointment nothing happened they said i can come on the tuesday then when i went on the tuesday the doctor looked at the seat and said it's badly inflamed i can't even touch it i can only measure it after measuring it he said at the moment we can't do anything i'd like to take it out but i can't touch it so take the pain kill up take the antibiotics go away for two weeks i looked at him i said i must stay with us for two weeks he said yes go away for two weeks then come back in two weeks let's take it out then as i was busy taking the medication i thought of a testimony where brother branham prayed for the two sisters one had a tumor can remember what the other one was struggling from but the angel visited the neighborhood they got healed i said lord i actually don't want an operation i know i'm not a vain person but an operation where people are going to see i don't want a scar and i left there then it was hardly three days after then i realized that the cyst is starting to clear itself up but whenever it clears when you finish when you're touching you can see there's no opening where you say it opened here it cleared it will just open and clear and close itself again then it happened for about seven to nine days then it was totally cleared up then i said okay fine the doctor said i must come let me book with him to go see him when i when i tried booking they said he was off he's got covet then it extended by a week then on the third week when i went he looked at it he said i would have loved to remove the whole thing but as you said it creates itself there's nothing in there anymore there is nothing i can do we don't need to do an operation wow then i was like thank god because i am i did not want the operation yet i wanted the cyst to go and the lord made a way that it cleared itself there's no scar you cannot even see how it cleared itself because the skin looked the same everywhere so it can only be the hand of the lord and i just wanted to bring praise and thanks to the lord because i came for prayer and the lord answered prayer amen amen is the god who wants us back praise the lord well god bless your friends you're dismissed in jesus christ's name and we've got lunch strictly after yeah but god bless you all praise the lord actually sorry the youth are going on the snow
