thinking brother John amen god bless you all you got your Bibles handy let's go to Genesis chapter 5 Amen it's good to be good to be home I'm so the Saints up in Auckland brother Derek Donaldson and saints they you know they send their greetings and their love was good to be up there with them you know and it's funny I honestly feel nervous yeah normally you know when you go visiting some of your eyes just the you know I feel like that anyway Genesis 5 and 21 and then we're going to go to Jobe 14 and it's going to read a couple of scriptures here so so Jenna says 5 and 21 and Genesis 5 and 21 says I mean and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begat methuselah three hundred years and he begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty and five years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him I mean wouldn't you like that for your testimony I'll leave just to walk with God now a job chapter 14 this is really I want to get my my thought from Joe 14 and 7 now this in the midst of job's great trial he doesn't know what's going on he doesn't even know of the life hereafter or even though he does believe in God he offers sacrifices continually but he's here and he's and he sitting in the midst of his trial and he and he begins to speak he says now speak of nature he says now for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that that tender branch therefore will not cease though the root there of wax old in the earth and the stock thereof died on the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth bowels like a plant but man dieth and wasteth away yeh man giveth up the ghost and where is he as the waters failed from the sea in the flood decay and dries up so man life down and raiseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep o that they would have hide me in the grave that they would have keep me secret until they wrath be passed that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come I mean my lord bless his word you may have your seats I want to I want to take a foot therefrom well you know until I will wait I will all the days of my appointed time while I wait till my change come now we understand from the from the reading of the scripture that Joe that sorry that that Enoch now Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so he was alive he didn't die and he walked with God and God took them from the earth into heaven and we understand from the you know that that the Old Testament is a shadow of the New Testament so what you see in the Old Testament is a pre figure of of what has been lived out in the New Testament era that is not just a bunch of stories or your history but there's a it's a shadow it's pointing to something and so if there's a shadow there has to become a reality and so Enoch now Enoch was the seventh from Adam it says and in the book of Juden and Enoch now he so being the seventh from seventh from from Adam it speaks of being in the seventh church age of the believers in the last days they will walk with God and they'll be not for God will take them upon the earth so now it's not just a nice prophecy of future time that may come but it's actually being lived out I mean I trust you can identify yourself yo in Enochs life you say I am actually living out what Enoch was was a foreshadow of Alleluia because if you look into the scripture you should be able to find a character in the Bible that's actually already lived out what you are facing and if they overcame you'll overcome I'm in there secrets you know in the scripture that you got you're like here's a chi or you take David or Moses or any other believers down through how they overcame you'll overcome in the same way now it says and so now we understand that the Christian life is a walk of faith now we may not know what we're going to face even maybe next week you know we have no idea what what could happen to us you know you know even even tomorrow even when we walk out these doors you don't know really what's going to happen but we understand we know where we're going to go I mean we know our our in destination where it's going to be and so it is a walk of faith so soft Enoch so Enoch had to walk by faith remember Enoch didn't just have it all he just lived in paradise and everything just went well and he never had a bad day in his life he faces hand controls you face a mess just in seed form in the book of Genesis but you know so he had ups and downs he had hardship but the main thing is he walked with God amen now seasoned Hebrews 11:5 if you want to go there now I am going to get to speak about Joe but I just want to lay this lay this out because it says now by faith in Hebrews 11:5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so now many times you take that people take that scripture all without faith as a possible to please them but you've got to take the opposite of it with faith it's impossible not to please them amen and we know faith is not just a mental understanding you know the book of James tells us you believe there is one God you do well the devil's also believe and they tremble so they have some kind of faith but it's not what it's not it's not revealed faith it's just an intellectual faith they just have it under ending amen so real faith well well cause you to please God amen if you have revealed faith if it's been revealed to you you're like Peter was their knees and Jesus is speaking to his disciples and said who do men say that I am well you are your Jeremiah our lives or one of the prophets but who do you say though he says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God is blessed our Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven so it became a revelation to him it was revealed to have and faith when when something is quickened to you this is not a member Christianity is not just learning something it's not just a change in behavior that's not Christianity the the Pharisees had a change in behavior they they had now what appearance with just a holiness I mean but Christianity is a life comes into you changes your your thinking your way of doing things changes your nature I mean it changes your nature you know we're not we don't I don't believe in a reformation amen I don't believe in just our good behavior means you have the Holy Ghost amen brother Graham says after the seals open it's a definite experience he has asked the question he says it's a definite experience so you have to meet God Abraham didn't thought he didn't think I've met God he really met him Moses really met him a mentor you know all the all the believers down through they actually really met God the same God on the day of Pentecost is they really had an experience here on the day of Pentecost they didn't say well now we've been here long enough should we go start our ministry they waited until I meant even though all they'd say well well we believe but I had to be quick and made alive to them I mean it's a definite experience whoa what should I look for just just seek Him and watch what he does to you and look at the life that's produced afterwards I mean by your their fruits you will know them and it's not a hope so I think it's a no so howl ooh yeah I believe God's God speaks to people I mean I believe that he speaks to people as not just you speaking them he speaks to you hallelujah remember if he's the same yesterday today and forever you say well he's not walking around in a body of flesh the way he appears may be different but the same God he's still the same God in character and nature and the things he does I mean if he healed someone and the passing you'll heal the same today if he fills with the Holy Spirit and the and the past you'll do the same today I mean if people speak in tongues in the past I'll speak in tongues today if they prophesied in the past I'll prophesied the day they lay hands upon the sick amen and they recover he'll do the same thing today if they cast out Devils in the past he'll do the same thing today hallelujah if he breaks changed in the past he'll break change today amen if he restores I mean if he if he heals the brokenhearted he'll do the same thing today because the anointing is the same Alleluia we don't serve a dead you know we I'm jumping away he to myself but nothing against them but the Baptist say you believe it you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe but Paul came you're Paul and an ex 19 he was speaking to a policies have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I said we don't even know about anything about the Holy Ghost he was preaching Christ you go read it he was preaching Jesus from the scripture he was a believer but he hadn't been quickened he hadn't been made alive hallelujah so we're not a bunch of message Baptists we're not just a bunch of professors without really possessing something Alleluia amen so enoch now so with faith if it's been revealed to you early that's why real revealed not a hope so but something anchors in your soul has words changing you early if something's happened to you I mean you no longer the same person Allu you with that kind of faith it's impossible not to please him I mean cuz it's faith yo our walk is a walk of faith maybe our brother perhaps hid in the church book at your own ages past they believed was the blood and works gave you salvation it was the blood and then your works but it's but it's not that way at all it's all the blood I mean it's all the blood it's just that life that was released there on Calvary comes into you and it does the works out of you works as faith Express I don't have to try and do anything I just yield myself and he lives but man doesn't want to live that way they will I need to do something you just need to die you just need to fully a real repentance turns your heart I mean repentance not just I got busted and I'm sorry is actually a real repentance turns your heart hallelujah because otherwise you'll be the same person but we all have a free moral agency we have a free moral choice yeah we all have a free moral choice but your nature will govern what you choose to do Amen we're not just a bunch of blank canvases that I would just do it know your nature will govern you so it depends what your nature is that's what you'll choose that's why we need a nature change I mean that's why you know man when they're born we have a fallen nature that's why man doesn't seek after God the scripture is not 1:6 after him because their nature is pointing the wrong way but then God comes along I'm so glad I'm glad it's his work amen and cause this unit because you were to give yourself over cause you to turn and really repent he leads you through the repentance and your heart has turned he said there's been a change in me this jesus hit me free hallelujah that's what real repentance is amen now I want you to just notice here Enoch it says now he lived sixty and five years and beer and beget Methuselah and he not what with God after he begat methuselah three hundred years and he beget sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years and he not walk with God here is not for God took him now there's no record in the scripture of Enoch walking with God the first 65 years as just me there's no record of it doesn't say he walked with God 65 years then he beget Methuselah then no there's no record so something happened to him when he was 65 years old there's just me a meant something happened to him and it caused him to walk with God hallelujah and he was one there were a whole bunch of other people upon the earth but yet God chose to walk with him amen and there's a whole bunch of people upon the earth and God chooses to walk with you hallelujah amen friends if faith I'm just going to forgive me if I just jump around but a faith is because something's really been revealed to you that gives you overcoming power against the enemy your faith is your victory Eliott season and John first John five and three for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith earlier doesn't say that's born of the church that's born of God I mean we're not here to make people into Shekinah Tabernacle uns Amen or little bin blinds this is not the purpose of of gathering as that God would come and transform us that we would become this lived out this is not a joining a church you know you can come to this church you can still miss it it's an individual affair between you and God that you must personally meet him for yourself Alleluia amen so the faith is our victory that causes us to overcome no she didn't say it's his own ability or how you're built it's your faith though you're faithful you're Moses he knew here's the proper child that's why I killed the Egyptian you want to stir something up how am I going to deliver my people fail but then now God met him in the burning bush and it became a life to him hallelujah and then he went down by faith he went down into Egypt 80 years old with a stick in his hand with us with us with his wife and couple of young boys on a donkey where he going Moses I'm going to take over think about that magic going to Washington today superpower the world where you going I'm going to take over the thing is he did it because it was revealed to him and that whole kingdom had to bow to the what he said hallelujah the whole kingdom he didn't have to work it up he was just by led by God and that was under the blood of bulls and goats how much more how much will them they're under the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah you know when God speaks that brings order out of chaos amen see you see in the beginning the world was covered in darkness covered in water and then God began to speak it was chaos then became an order those in Eden amen it's the same thing now when God speaks today there can be a sickness in a body what is what is a disease in a body its itself and it's wrong you know as fallen from her how it should be into a wrong state so it went from order to chaos I mean but there within God speaks it takes that chaos and puts it back into water Alleluia and it's all because he paid for it all on Calvary and then he released the power amen - to whatever you have need of to give it to you so if you're sick you know God created you I came to a conclusion you know about our daughter Emily she had the tongue tie it had to be it had to be not just a little one but had to really cut and we prayed and so I was all booked in for the surgery because I believe in medicine - it's all booked them for the surgery and we prayed I said Lord before the surgeon goes to cut her tongue might be gone Christine's taking her a week later is a bit of mouth blood comes in her mouth she says no pain takes her straight that's virtually on the way to the surgery the surgeon opens the mouth says there's no tongue tie here now I just came to a conclusion if God can separate cells and and lactation could you know a lactation consultants is that doesn't happen that way completely healthy and well he didn't need to cut a little bit more help it was just done and I came to the conclusion if God can separate cells amen he can put them back together he can restore house meant to be hallelujah we can't limit God friends Alou yeah well you've never seen it happen if he's done that he can do more amen hallelujah yes just what but let's see what you speak in faith if it's God it doesn't matter how you feel it's not do you feel it do you believe it I felt this is a post when I prayed that prayer but yet God still came upon the scene you yeah it's just like Christine she had a little white growth on the side of her head you know up here and she and she would pray against it and then but then one day it was quickened to her that's not part of her and it fell off had some roots didn't darling what happened her confession her faith now cause that thing which not part of it'll everbody Alleluia now so faith causes us to overcome you say well what you still have had enemies had the surgery if God didn't do that absolutely she was booked in she's on her way so I believe in doctors too God gave us good medicine but don't limit God just to medicine amen now it says in Psalms 37 23 now just as you're turning there it says now this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so there has to be a battle in order for there to be a victory if it's just given to you on a silver platter that's not a victory that's just given to you amen but it has to be a Esther be a battle in order to have a victory now it says here in Psalms 37 23 remember we have a walk like Enoch had a walk with God he was the shadow you're the reality right and it says here in Psalms 37 and 23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand now this word the step yeah the word good man here and the in the Hebrew it means a valiant man or a warrior they can't just it can't just actually mean just a person but also means a valiant man or a warrior and the root word of this Hebrew word it means to be strong by implication to prevail Amy sir says the steps of a person like this are ordered of the Lord hallelujah and he delighteth in his way so God the lights in his way you know God you know it's like we're in a God wants to prove himself in your everyday life he wants to prove himself and you Amen it's like Lord show me your ways and then things begin to happen to you because he wants to reveal he was show himself and what you're going through just like we're in a boxing room devil you're the devil's our opponent but Jesus is our trainer we may go around to get knocked down but then we go back to the corner because tell us they'll do this do this change change how you doing things amen isn't it that way and then you begin to change what you're doing through his instruction and then eventually you're the devil's face down on the on the mat but don't just yo kick him when he's down don't let him get back up kick him when he's down but God wants a shot he wants to prove himself you thought Lord show me your ways and then he'll allow trials to come and hardship and you may not know which way to go but he wants to reveal himself to you through those things hallelujah so if you're looking for him you'll see them in your life amen send out the steps of a good man are ordered a lord so a walkers a we know it's a bunch of steps yep so God now maybe I just going to turn the corner a little bit but you know if this is the way if our steps are ordered in the good times and the bad times are ordered the hard times and the rejoicing times are ordered the happy times the sad times are ordered it's been predetermined your walk has been predetermined by God God doesn't get surprised when you fall or when something happens you know you're in a car crash or whatever may happen he's not he's not going I didn't see that coming because if he didn't see it coming he wouldn't be God he wouldn't know the end from the beginning amen so but we don't we don't always look at things that way we think things are going well God's please things are going bad gods not belief amen but it's actually in the bad times is when gods really wants to prove himself enjoy the good times but also enjoy the bad times because the bad times when gods want to show himself to you remember Enoch had a walk now brother Bram says this in the Lamb's Book of Enoch called the Lamb's Book of Life of 56 remember its season and in the book of Revelation that they would not worship the Beast whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life in the foundation of the world so there's a whole group of names that God has written say these are mine Amen see if your name is there he said how do I know my name is there when God spoken to you something quickened in your soul amen and that to me that shows I don't I'm predestinated because it's word has changed me Amen it's not just a change of a it's not a mental assent to an idea but it's become a living reality you know you could learn all about God but that's actually totally that's that that's futile you got to meet him I meant now last book of life he says now word is a thought express God begin to think as he began to see every human being it ever came on earth and every bird and every flea and every fly hallelujah that makes him the almighty eternal ever-present God that's the one we serve this morning way back in the beginning when he seen that there were some people who was going to desire to be saved some people who was going to want to be saved some people who would be loyal in their heart they wanted to be saved then he's got to make a preparation for their salvation that's right or they will never be saved and he knows that anything imperfect cannot come into heaven so he has to make a way of perfection for that amen you see it then back there he said I myself will come down into the world take on human flesh I'll pay the penalty that's required here I'll take the place I'll make them perfect because I'll bring them I'll bring them in me and I am perfect then when Jesus said be therefore perfect even as those which are and even as your father in heaven is perfect then here was this mangled body that was beaten and bruised for sin in every sin that the world ever had or ever would have was laid upon him and he is the body that Jehovah raised up in the last days there on the third day after his death and if we are in that body was just as perfect as the body is amen there you are how do I get to that body how do I get into it the Bible said in Romans 8:1 therefore there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but the Spirit they don't care what the world says or what anybody else is or even what their family says they walk in the Spirit of God perfect divine love you see it how do you get into it by joining church by shaking hands by water baptism no sir the twelfth chapter of 1st Corinthians is by one spirit all baptized into one body and become members of that body then it's not what I've done what I am who I was or nothing about it that's what God has done for me in Christ and we are perfect with our sacrifice he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if he wasn't worthy he knows your heart that's right he knows what you are he knows your motives he knows what you are there's traps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say god I didn't mean to do that God you know it you're still perfect because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day and a bleeding sacrifice hanging before the throne of Almighty God that's right how do you get in there God by foreknowledge now God said that Jesus now put on your caps open your heart look the Bible said that Jesus was slain at the lamb slain from where the foundation of the world here slayed way God the Father when he looked down and seen how Jesus never come just to die haphazard death and you ever come to say well maybe somebody will have pity when they see the way I die and everything naught wasn't God doesn't run his business like that God runs his business perfect that's right he note exactly what was going to take place that's where he could for say he knows exactly what he he's not willing that any should perish he's not willing but if he's infinite he knows who will and who won't therefore you can rest assure if you receive God and been filled with the Holy Spirit you're anchored to your eternal destination correctly he for know how lujah no job joke said I'll wait to my point of days until my change come so he was waiting in a place he was waiting just in life until until death until has changed come now we are not in that same kind of bracket because he didn't know what was coming thank you very much he did not know at at stage of his walk what what what is there beyond this beyond this world but then after God came and spoke to me says now I know my Redeemer liveth amen and I will stand with him that day on the earth amazed I'll see God with my eyes I'll see God so he had a revelation though that it wasn't just now I'm just going to wait here until my until I die but he knew that there was a place Hereafter now Jesus had a walk in this world he had a walk in this world God the word God became flesh and dwelt among us we're not saved by the blood of a Jew we're not saved by the blood of the Gentile we're saved by the blood of God that was shed amen he was he was not a Jew if not a Gentile he was God as a man God became flesh and dwelt among us now his ministry started with death because Jordan is always a type of death in his baptized in the River Jordan says ministry started with a death and ended with his death physically you're humanly speaking his walk was a denial of self amen he says if any man be my disciple you take up your cross deny yourself take up your cross and follow me and he doesn't make people do things that he hasn't done himself already a mentor was a walk of self-denial but you see and a walk of death but he had to do that in order for you to walk with God for him to walk with you now here he was and he took on it says in Hebrews 2 he has made a little lower than the Angels they came as the seed of Abraham became a man and using death he took it that he might destroy the power of death that is the devil who took death upon himself I mean to destroy the power of death that he would deliver us and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage so he delivered us because you know if man is man is scared without knowing Jesus Christ people are scared where am I going to go I don't know you know when they come down to the last few moments they realize what's really happening but the believer we're not afraid amen Anna Anna but Christians can still be afraid if they don't really know him a mint because you know I know some people they're afraid Oh am I doing this right am i doing this right you know is this and they and their whole life is just a whole bunch of fear am i pleasing or I'm not bleating in they're all like treading on eggshells the whole time because they don't know because the fear hasn't been taken away perfect love casts out fear cuz this all right now he says oh Jesus now because many times we want to hold onto things because others say well you don't know what I've lived through yeah some people don't are not willing to give things over to him because they well you don't know where I've been through you wouldn't understand my walk Jesus I just think that's the other weekend I was just rejoicing Jesus died as a sinner I meant when he was crying out my god my god was out forsaken me it was just I have to fulfill some prophecy that will speak you meet but he was generally crying that up he died as a sinner taking your sin upon himself here so he actually died lost in a way amen he died as a sinner in your place you've never experienced that and he took your son down to hell amen oh you wouldn't understand he's been through far worse that we have been through and that and to me that is far more terrifying than just just the beatings and the scourging and the crucifixion I mean because that's just human pain that's not going into an endless eternity hallelujah so he died in our place as a sinner and he took our sins to hell that's why we can sing living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified me freely forever one day is coming oh glorious day hallelujah now there is a place for the believer job said I'll wait my appointed days until my change come now the believer has a very different kind of in this hour we're not just living out life until we die yeah but we are heading away in Christ Jesus it's got a Deuteronomy 16 and 1 there is a place of worship that God has ordained and it's not four walls of a building amen I've talked about individual believers now he says in its own judor army sixteen and one now if you're in this place you can just let off the pressure if you're in this place a many seas now observe the month of ever see this goes beyond it goes beyond well I understand doctrine Amen or I live a moral life it goes beyond there we should live a clean moral life because we love him I mean we should understand he says when the spirit of truth is come here Legion guide you into all truth so you should understand doctrine but it's more than that because if you're just in a in a just just living a living a life that's one kind of place that's one kind of position you're in but if you're in this place this is where you need to be observed the month of abbath and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God from the month of Abbot the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover answer the LORD thy God and of the flocking of the heard and the place which the LORD hath chose to place his name there notice a place God chose to place his name thou shall eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therefore even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt and hast that thou mayst remember the day when thou comest forth our land of Egypt all the days of thy life and there shall be no leavened bread seen within all biko seven days neither shall there be anything of the flesh which else we shall sacrifice us the first day it even remain all night until the morning thou mayst not sacrifice the Passover within within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God has given thee but the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name it there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover it even at the going down of the Sun even at the season when thou come us forth out of Egypt Amen see he's saying no there's a place where you must sacrifice where I have put my name right so God is actually designating a place that you must be to sacrifice right it's not just any old place it's not where you have put your name but it's where God has put his own name that's where you must that's the place you must be in Alleluia and so it's very quite simple Jesus came and he said I come in my father's name and you received me not what is the name of the Father Jesus you know he he had lots of down through the Old Testament he was known as Jehovah I mean he has done as as Elohim else Shetty I you know he had many different titles but his name the greatest revelation of who God is is Jesus Jehovah Savior and it's not just to save from from sickness or or a physical salvation like the Israelites are taken out of Egypt but it's but it's a spiritual salvation where people can be delivered from from the bondage of fear and death and be translators the scripture says into the kingdom of a son I'll either they can be taken so there's no fear there shouldn't be no fear in our lives if this heart fails right now I'm ready I trust you have that revelation in your soul I'll loose you say no there's a place where God has chosen to put his name and so God put his name in his son Jesus Christ that's the place that he put his name and the only way you can get into that place has to be baptized with the Holy Spirit of God that's how you get into that place hallelujah and if you're in that place friends you've you've won you've won the game of life hallelujah you've yeah you've come to the place you really need to be in you know when the disciples went into the upper room hallelujah that same God that was on Calvary that ascended on high came down in another form and dwelt in them and they became God's place of worship Olu you I mean God was in them and he became that was God's chosen place of worship was being in Jesus Christ Allu you Amen no it's yours he sees in God's provided place of worship he says they were quickened into the prints of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost God's quickening power baptized them into that they were in the place of worship then they were where they could actually worship amen it's more than just coming to a building this is not you know you have to be in Christ to really worship God that's very elementary but you must be in him to really worship Him because that's where God said this is whether this is where you're going to this is where you're going to offer the you know Passover and we have what pastor that's been given by one offering I have perfected forever them that are sanctified I mean the lamb has been killed on our behalf amen and so he's be saying I'm going to I'm going to sacrifice in this place and this is where you must be you can't do it anywhere else I mean so we can't we can't actually worship God give sacrifices in our own understanding I mean we can't worship ever according to Creed's and dogmas of man but you got to be in Jesus Christ and Christ as his word Alleluia so if we are if we are in that place of worship now worshipper has has some very you know a worshiper has has rights yeah if their worship is accepted then God can step on their behalf and help them Alleluia I mean but if God doesn't accept the worship Abel Abel by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain amen and and he wasn't lost when he was murdered but he went up into paradise right and the and the worshiper so it's like us now we have a need who has a need Amen if you ever need and you're in this place of worship and cry I'm not this this for walls just a building Amen this is just a building that that we can rent and we can have Church in but just coming to this church doesn't give you eternal life I mean doesn't give you eternal life just because you're around the believers you got to know him for yourself I mean you've got to be baptized into this place of worship he baptized into Christ they were there didn't they could really worship the Sanhedrin or nothing else could ever bother them because they work wicked they were new people that's after they was baptized look at little herb Stephen he come into he came into God's provided way was quickened by the power of God he came into the gate God's provided way and then when they went to kill him to stone him he says I see heavens opening Jesus standing on the right hand of God hallelujah they were sealed away into glass provided place of worship now when you're in that place then you can stay I will wait all my appointed days and there might change you'll come a mess does not mortal life leaving but the change is the change of the body Alleluia if you're in that place things are very different I mean Philip Stephen was just it was killed it didn't it didn't face him didn't matter what they through didn't against them amen the Holy Spirit came by a bunch of stiff necked hearts and ears you do is resist the Holy Ghost as your father's do but he wasn't too worried about your what they'd do to him because he was quickened amen and he was taken right to the prints of God when he died Alleluia so when you get baptized into that place then you can wait until your change comes this means something to you amen if you're in Christ those are in Christ God will bring with them Alleluia and so now if you're sealed away and there nothing can harm you I mean nothing can harm me if you're sealed away in there Amen you've won no weapon formed against II will prosper your fallen ear of all things if you're in this place Amen Sam's twenty seven and one let's just go there does this mean something to you free who isn't God if you're in God's provide a place of worship in Christ I mean you got to be in Christ that's God's provide a place of worship and if you're in that place I mean you've been quickened unto that place then you can really worship God Alleluia the blood puts us back on speaking terms again amen we're by that sacrifice now you talk to him and he talks to you amen and it's not your ability that puts you on speaking terms it's his blood Amen it's his life in you that's what puts you on speaking terms Alleluia Sam's twenty-seven and one now when brother Brown comes to the end of his ministry he preaches on the rapture and he goes to the scripture this is his opening scripture about the rapture and to me he's speaking of the condition of the people that go in the rapture right amen a psalm of David see the the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid he is the strength of my life I trust you can see that he is my light and my salvation God's my salvation God's my deliverer earlier he's my light I'm not walking in darkness amen whom shall I fear whom shall we fear if God is for us who can be against us if God is for you who can be against you earlier formulism won't hold you back Amen Stefan starchiness won't hold you back hallelujah you know we don't want to have just a formal worship we don't want just a formal statue walk with God we don't just want beautiful worship I mean well polish things we want God to live nothing wrong with Polish worship II know if we just settle back on these kind of things that's yo the devil doesn't care how how formal we can be and even how you know how dogmatic we can be if we miss that life amen and if we fail to let it live that's the problem Alleluia the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear people are afraid to let go I just say people are afraid to actually lose control of themselves don't be afraid to just let go and let God have his way I met the devil the devil loves you to keep control he comes to church he said before anyone else is here and he's the last one to leave and he says don't enjoy it don't don't be blessed by the singing don't trust all your off-key or you're too loud or too young he's always there trying to keep you down hello does this just be don't enjoy the work don't stand up and praise God and shout and clap or whatever more amen hey we should feel free to do what we want to do Allu you and it might just spread no one else's do it might just spread if it's an order if it's God doing it it's not out of order I mean the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell I mean once upon a time we stumbled and fell hallelujah but whether your quickened by the Spirit of God it's not you are not the devil's punching back anymore but he's your punching bag Holly there is a change in role amen it's likethey you know it's like when the when when the you know when the King you're king of hazardous he couldn't sleep he says bring me the records and now the book becomes open and and it's open to a certain place and speak about what Mordecai does and when the book became open Mordecai before that was going to be hung and Haman was Joe still gonna be Prime Minister but then when the book when the wood came open their roles their positions were changed I mean where was now Mordecai became prime minister at Haman was hung because that was actually what their inheritance was going to be hallelujah and now we're standing here this is not a book of mystery anymore and God opens it and he reveals your portion in the word he reveals what you've been what's been allotted to you hallelujah and if he is a lot of something to you he quickens it to you makes it Lou Alleluia you know we're not trying to struggle and obtain to become something it's just God says I'm going to make you this it's not if you do this older this he says I made you this and you just walk with God Enoch just walk is just another day God said you want to come home Olu yeah he just he just kept walking and went from this realm to the next realm and he was gone just another day in his life Alleluia it'll be the same thing with you and I just be another day the rapture is just going to be another day like any other day doesn't matter how we feel about it you may wake up Greeks and Crohn's groans and children not sleeping the night before in they turn 18 hallelujah their voices drop or whatever things change you see some people just turn up and there's something familiar about them beat but they're young they're been between 18 and 21 hallelujah they begin to speak to you and then they disappear and to do in Christ will rise first amen and they and they rise first because they're because they're going to come and tell you you're in you've made it because you're in God's provided place of worship Allu you I've seen a few Saints going to the ground I expect to see them one day and they will not be old they'll be young Alleluia amen da host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear amen to the enemy sorry go back that verse came upon me on my flesh they stumbled and fell amen so that's sickness that's anything anything that can be named you just you just put a tag good if you want that will stumble and fall the host should encamp because why it will not take your faith away yes I mean we do not live according to all my faith is strong because things are going well all my faith is weak because things are going bad that's not how we walk that's not how we walk with God if things are good praise His name if things are terrible praise His name anyway only a things are going sideways hallelujah because he's ordained my steps this way hallelujah we don't need to worry about anything because the devil wants to rob you of your faith if he can but if it's been revealed to you you must try to deny yourself you can't deny yourself Alleluia the host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing I've desired the law that I'll seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple from the time of trouble he'll hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle chellie hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now my head will be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer this Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing you I'll sing crazes unto the Lord he's not speaking about a physical building freeze the temple wasn't even built when David wrote this he's talking about a place hallelujah he's talking about a place God's provide a place of worship Alleluia he says this is the thing I want to be in this place and I'll tell you this much if you've gone into that place you can't come out of that place I mean you can't you can't be sealed into the kingdom then be unsealed and is that you'll walk again you can have your sealed in your sealed in when God when God fills you with a spirit he's figure he's shown you're forgiven you of your past president future sins I'm not condoning said be shown I have I have examined you you're part of me I've branded you with my spirit early I've sealed you under the kingdom it says don't grieve the Holy Ghost we're by your seal you can grieve them but doesn't unseal you it doesn't mean you come in and you go out you come in and go out and it's all of your and then you begin to because if you get stuck in that kind of right of a way you look at your how am i tracking how's my stats doing am i you know am i hitting my personal best with my walk with God or am I am i really something's happened and you're looking at you that's right hello you look at the wrong person Alleluia so he says we're sealed away he says now this is the place you want to be in remember we're justified by faith we're sanctified by the blood and then we're sealed into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost amen there's three stages to the walk and it's God doing all three amen so don't just don't just be justified don't just be sanctified cleansed set apart for service you got to be filled Amen it's like me you know if I fell into a massive debt that I couldn't pay and then a very rich guy came along said I'll pay your debt and then I accept then I accept his has money to to pay off my debts there's no change in me so I can fall back into how I got into debt but if the spirit of that businessman who has all the money comes into me then I'll have the ability that I can't fault that did anymore I mean it's the same thing with us God can justify us but if the nature still the same then we can fall back into a debt again amen or we can be sanctified but if the nature of whom doesn't come into us then we can become unsanctified because it's our nature you following me but if he comes and dwells in you alert then your nature has changed and then things are totally different hallelujah amen he's meeting the Lord as a definite experience I meant you got to open your heart and just let him do what he wants to do Allu you so if we're in God's provide a place of worship it doesn't matter what happens with us that you're in Christ you've won everything your fallen ear to all things as well so you got to really look by faith and look what belongs to you I mean but we're not just like Jobe I'll wait here until my change comes amen in a way because we're not just waiting for for the clock to tick around you know you you come into this place right you come into this place you're waiting for a body change you're under expectation for a body change sure but now it's like now what belongs to me you're not just sitting back I trust you not this way you know the spirit searches out the deeper things of God Alleluia I want more of a reality I want more of a reality I just don't want to go service after service and we have this and we have this and I want God to be more real I don't just want to have camp experiences at camp or convention experiences at conventions it should be every Sunday that's my expectation that's what I want hallelujah now I've just finished with this I don't know work what the time is but he says now this is in the deity of Jesus Christ he says the Son of God that was in the cradle is in the heart now he's the deity of God he's God the Creator he was in the world and the world was made by him in the world knew him not and today that's what's the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism of the holy ghost has come into the people's hearts and they don't recognize what it is they think it's a little Church joining or something like that but that is the the God the Creator living in you and giving you all the power and you're in possession of everything that he had so then you to abstain from evil to do good to shun evil and flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation or malice hatred strife envy so forth come away from it and that all and that'll take him from your heart if you receive them embrace them and love them and hold them in your heart and love them I tell you the church together and that kind of a power has the power to bind the heavens to heal the sick to open the eyes of the blind hallelujah the Deaf speak that I've cited so the dumb speak the Deaf hear the cripples walk the blind see why it's recognizing the power of your mighty God into your heart there hears the deity he says do you love them amen I'll finish with this note you may think sometimes we we sit and we listen we think I could not how could I even grab that I can I can't get it's here somewhere and the dear voice is where you don't hear somewhere you can't you've know you're not worthy enough to actually lay hold of that and I'll say this I've said it a few dives but Jacob wanted the birthright what do you want this morning he wanted the birthright so Ennis but he was born second so he couldn't he there's no way he could have received it it was impossible for him to receive that birthright he couldn't go on before his father and say give me the birthright as far as you say I can't give it to you you're not my firstborn son right it was impossible and so now here he comes and his mother says now dress up like your older brother Esau so basically deny yourself cover yourself with the with the goat skins put on Esau's jacket and things gone before your blind father that you can receive what you need and so remember his daddy was a prophet God could have shown him this is this is Jacob he's lying to you he's trying to deceive you so he Leah he would he would have got in there with fear yeah he would have gone there with fear but yet his heart was I want the birthright what do you have need of this morning I just want to challenge you what do you have need of you say well I can't obtain healing or deliverance or salvation I can't I have no right to go Oh God and get that I'm unworthy I'm just a man I remember he became a man he came down in your place amen and he felt it to all things and Jacob denied himself denied who he was he goes in before as you know as far this is who are you says I'm Esau he didn't know who he was deny his condition and whatever state he is and he says I am your older son amen and God honored it and God gave him the birthright and God blessed them amen because in his heart was I want the birthright but he had to deny himself and what he thought about himself amen take on the identity of his older brother to receive what he needed and it's the same thing today because we look at ourselves I look at myself saying I can't how can i how can this body be changed how can I walk in at you know an overcoming life how can I receive healing or deliverance or whatever I did off I'm not worthy to receive it you're looking at the wrong guy amen he went in and got what he needed how about you amen if you ever need this morning you're welcome to come for prayer but it's according to your faith EEMA jesus paid it all pay for everything he didn't have to pay any more interest off he paid it in full who paid for all healing he paid for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he paid for overcoming power he paid for a people to be restored back what they should be in he he paid for dominion over Satan hell death and the grave Amen he yo you know he paid for all the love joy peace longsuffering all those different things amen whatever you have need of he's already paid for it and brother Bram says that faith in the finished work of Calvary unlocks every promise Amen so it's for it's not in faith of what you are it's faith in what he has done Amen Alleluia and and the reason you say well how do I know he did it well I know he died on the cross because he transformed me how do you know that bias stripes we were healed because I've seen him heal a man how do you know that you know the anointing was come to bind up the brokenhearted at liberty them that are bruised I've seen it happen amen so and if he's done it before he'll do it again baby you say well I'm not worth it you just got to give yourself over to him don't be afraid to let go well he might reject me all that come to me I know wise cast out that's what he said all that come to I know wise cast out so he can't say that and do something else amen we have some musicians to come I'll Lou you now God is a life I'm contending you know people say oh you're against things no I'm not against I'm for things I mean I'm for a living reality I mean if people only really knew the reality of a walk with God it's not about stopped us do this don't do this do this now if you only knew the reality of walking with him things would be totally different lujah we've had God alive in this generation we should never settle for anything less than him being alive today because if he is if he is God he'll be the same today amen I want to own a sing that song there is a name I love to hear I love to sing it's worth oh how I love Jesus because he first loved me I mean you love them this morning who's in gods provide a place of worship hallelujah Amen I'm going to stay in this place until my change comes
