[55:03] 5 and 21 and then we're going to go to
[55:05] Jobe 14 and it's going to read a couple
[55:11] of scriptures here so so Jenna says 5
[55:13] and 21 and Genesis 5 and 21 says I mean
[55:22] and enoch lived sixty and five years and
[55:25] begat methuselah and Enoch walked with
[55:28] God after he begat methuselah three
[55:30] hundred years and he begat sons and
[55:32] daughters
[55:32] and all the days of Enoch were three
[55:35] hundred and sixty and five years and
[55:37] Enoch walked with God and he was not for
[55:41] God took him I mean wouldn't you like
[55:42] that for your testimony
[55:43] I'll leave just to walk with God now a
[55:46] job chapter 14 this is really I want to
[55:52] get my my thought from Joe 14 and 7 now
[56:02] this in the midst of job's great trial
[56:04] he doesn't know what's going on he
[56:05] doesn't even know of the life hereafter
[56:08] or even though he does believe in God he
[56:10] offers sacrifices continually but he's
[56:13] here and he's and he sitting in the
[56:15] midst of his trial and he and he begins
[56:16] to speak he says now speak of nature he
[56:19] says now for there is hope of a tree if
[56:21] it be cut down that it will sprout again
[56:23] and that that tender branch therefore
[56:25] will not cease though the root there of
[56:28] wax old in the earth and the stock
[56:29] thereof died on the ground yet through
[56:33] the scent of water it will bud and bring
[56:35] forth bowels like a plant but man dieth
[56:38] and wasteth away yeh man giveth up the
[56:41] ghost and where is he as the waters
[56:44] failed
[56:45] from the sea in the flood decay and
[56:47] dries up so man life down and raiseth
[56:50] not till the heavens be no more
[56:52] they shall not awake nor be raised out
[56:55] of their sleep o that they would have
[56:57] hide me in the grave that they would
[56:59] have keep me secret until they wrath be
[57:01] passed that thou wouldest appoint me a
[57:04] set time and remember me if a man die
[57:07] shall he live again all the days of my
[57:10] appointed time will I wait till my
[57:12] change come I mean my lord bless his
[57:15] word you may have your seats I want to I
[57:19] want to take a foot therefrom well you
[57:23] know until I will wait I will all the
[57:27] days of my appointed time while I wait
[57:29] till my change come now we understand
[57:33] from the from the reading of the
[57:35] scripture that Joe that sorry that that
[57:38] Enoch now Enoch walked with God and he
[57:40] was not for God took him so he was alive
[57:44] he didn't die and he walked with God and
[57:46] God took them from the earth into heaven
[57:48] and we understand from the you know that
[57:51] that the Old Testament is a shadow of
[57:54] the New Testament so what you see in the
[57:56] Old Testament is a pre figure of of what
[57:58] has been lived out in the New Testament
[58:00] era that is not just a bunch of stories
[58:02] or your history but there's a it's a
[58:04] shadow it's pointing to something and so
[58:07] if there's a shadow there has to become
[58:08] a reality and so Enoch now Enoch was the
[58:14] seventh from Adam it says and in the
[58:16] book of Juden and Enoch now he so being
[58:21] the seventh from seventh from from Adam
[58:23] it speaks of being in the seventh church
[58:25] age of the believers in the last days
[58:27] they will walk with God and they'll be
[58:29] not for God will take them upon the
[58:31] earth so now it's not just a nice
[58:35] prophecy of future time that may come
[58:37] but it's actually being lived out I mean
[58:40] I trust you can identify yourself yo in
[58:42] Enochs life you say I am actually living
[58:44] out what Enoch was was a foreshadow of
[58:47] Alleluia because if you look into the
[58:49] scripture you should be able to find a
[58:51] character in the Bible that's actually
[58:53] already lived out what you are facing
[58:55] and if they overcame you'll overcome
[58:58] I'm in there secrets you know in the
[59:00] scripture that you got you're like
[59:02] here's a chi or you take David or Moses
[59:04] or any other believers down through how
[59:06] they overcame you'll overcome in the
[59:08] same way
[59:09] now it says and so now we understand
[59:16] that the Christian life is a walk of
[59:18] faith now we may not know what we're
[59:22] going to face even maybe next week you
[59:24] know we have no idea what what could
[59:25] happen to us you know you know even even
[59:27] tomorrow even when we walk out these
[59:29] doors you don't know really what's going
[59:30] to happen but we understand we know
[59:33] where we're going to go I mean we know
[59:35] our our in destination where it's going
[59:37] to be and so it is a walk of faith so
[59:42] soft Enoch so Enoch had to walk by faith
[59:45] remember Enoch didn't just have it all
[59:47] he just lived in paradise and everything
[59:49] just went well and he never had a bad
[59:51] day in his life he faces hand controls
[59:53] you face a mess just in seed form in the
[59:56] book of Genesis but you know so he had
[59:58] ups and downs
[59:59] he had hardship but the main thing is he
[1:00:01] walked with God amen now seasoned
[1:00:05] Hebrews 11:5 if you want to go there now
[1:00:09] I am going to get to speak about Joe but
[1:00:13] I just want to lay this lay this out
[1:00:15] because it says now by faith in Hebrews
[1:00:19] 11:5 by faith Enoch was translated that
[1:00:27] he should not see death and was not
[1:00:29] found because God had translated him for
[1:00:31] before his translation he had this
[1:00:33] testimony that he pleased God but
[1:00:36] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:00:38] him for he that cometh to God must
[1:00:40] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:00:42] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:00:45] Him so now many times you take that
[1:00:47] people take that scripture all without
[1:00:48] faith as a possible to please them but
[1:00:50] you've got to take the opposite of it
[1:00:51] with faith it's impossible not to please
[1:00:54] them amen and we know faith is not just
[1:00:56] a mental understanding you know the book
[1:00:58] of James tells us you believe there is
[1:01:00] one God you do well the devil's also
[1:01:03] believe and they tremble so they have
[1:01:04] some kind of faith but it's not what
[1:01:06] it's not it's not revealed faith it's
[1:01:09] just an intellectual faith they just
[1:01:10] have it under
[1:01:11] ending amen so real faith well well
[1:01:14] cause you to please God amen if you have
[1:01:18] revealed faith if it's been revealed to
[1:01:20] you you're like Peter was their knees
[1:01:22] and Jesus is speaking to his disciples
[1:01:24] and said who do men say that I am well
[1:01:27] you are your Jeremiah our lives or one
[1:01:29] of the prophets but who do you say
[1:01:30] though he says thou art the Christ the
[1:01:32] Son of the Living God is blessed our
[1:01:34] Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has
[1:01:36] not revealed this to you but my father
[1:01:37] in heaven
[1:01:38] so it became a revelation to him it was
[1:01:41] revealed to have and faith when when
[1:01:43] something is quickened to you this is
[1:01:46] not a member Christianity is not just
[1:01:48] learning something it's not just a
[1:01:50] change in behavior that's not
[1:01:52] Christianity
[1:01:52] the the Pharisees had a change in
[1:01:54] behavior they they had now what
[1:01:56] appearance with just a holiness I mean
[1:01:58] but Christianity is a life comes into
[1:02:00] you changes your your thinking your way
[1:02:03] of doing things changes your nature I
[1:02:05] mean it changes your nature you know
[1:02:07] we're not we don't I don't believe in a
[1:02:10] reformation amen I don't believe in just
[1:02:13] our good behavior means you have the
[1:02:14] Holy Ghost amen brother Graham says
[1:02:17] after the seals open it's a definite
[1:02:18] experience he has asked the question he
[1:02:21] says it's a definite experience so you
[1:02:23] have to meet God Abraham didn't thought
[1:02:25] he didn't think I've met God he really
[1:02:27] met him Moses really met him a mentor
[1:02:30] you know all the all the believers down
[1:02:32] through they actually really met God the
[1:02:36] same God on the day of Pentecost is they
[1:02:38] really had an experience here on the day
[1:02:39] of Pentecost they didn't say well now
[1:02:41] we've been here long enough should we go
[1:02:43] start our ministry they waited until I
[1:02:45] meant even though all they'd say well
[1:02:47] well we believe but I had to be quick
[1:02:50] and made alive to them I mean it's a
[1:02:53] definite experience whoa what should I
[1:02:56] look for just just seek Him and watch
[1:02:59] what he does to you and look at the life
[1:03:01] that's produced afterwards I mean by
[1:03:04] your their fruits you will know them and
[1:03:07] it's not a hope so I think it's a no so
[1:03:09] howl ooh yeah I believe God's God speaks
[1:03:13] to people I mean I believe that he
[1:03:15] speaks to people as not just you
[1:03:17] speaking them he speaks to you
[1:03:19] hallelujah remember if he's the same
[1:03:23] yesterday today and forever
[1:03:25] you say well he's not walking around in
[1:03:28] a body of flesh the way he appears may
[1:03:30] be different but the same God he's still
[1:03:32] the same God in character and nature and
[1:03:34] the things he does I mean if he healed
[1:03:36] someone and the passing you'll heal the
[1:03:38] same today if he fills with the Holy
[1:03:41] Spirit and the and the past you'll do
[1:03:42] the same today I mean if people speak in
[1:03:45] tongues in the past I'll speak in
[1:03:46] tongues today if they prophesied in the
[1:03:48] past I'll prophesied the day they lay
[1:03:50] hands upon the sick amen and they
[1:03:52] recover he'll do the same thing today if
[1:03:53] they cast out Devils in the past he'll
[1:03:55] do the same thing today hallelujah if he
[1:03:58] breaks changed in the past he'll break
[1:03:59] change today amen if he restores I mean
[1:04:02] if he if he heals the brokenhearted
[1:04:04] he'll do the same thing today because
[1:04:06] the anointing is the same Alleluia we
[1:04:09] don't serve a dead you know we I'm
[1:04:11] jumping away he to myself but nothing
[1:04:14] against them but the Baptist say you
[1:04:16] believe it you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:04:18] when you believe but Paul came you're
[1:04:21] Paul and an ex 19 he was speaking to a
[1:04:24] policies have you received the Holy
[1:04:25] Ghost since you believed I said we don't
[1:04:28] even know about anything about the Holy
[1:04:29] Ghost he was preaching Christ you go
[1:04:31] read it he was preaching Jesus from the
[1:04:33] scripture he was a believer but he
[1:04:35] hadn't been quickened he hadn't been
[1:04:37] made alive hallelujah so we're not a
[1:04:40] bunch of message Baptists we're not just
[1:04:44] a bunch of professors without really
[1:04:47] possessing something Alleluia amen so
[1:04:51] enoch now so with faith if it's been
[1:04:54] revealed to you early that's why real
[1:04:57] revealed not a hope so but something
[1:04:59] anchors in your soul has words changing
[1:05:02] you early if something's happened to you
[1:05:05] I mean you no longer the same person
[1:05:08] Allu you with that kind of faith it's
[1:05:10] impossible not to please him I mean cuz
[1:05:14] it's faith yo our walk is a walk of
[1:05:16] faith maybe our brother perhaps hid in
[1:05:18] the church book at your own ages past
[1:05:21] they believed was the blood and works
[1:05:23] gave you salvation it was the blood and
[1:05:26] then your works but it's but it's not
[1:05:27] that way at all it's all the blood I
[1:05:30] mean it's all the blood
[1:05:33] it's just that life that was released
[1:05:35] there on Calvary comes into you and it
[1:05:37] does the works out of you works as faith
[1:05:39] Express I don't have to try and do
[1:05:41] anything I just yield myself and he
[1:05:44] lives but man doesn't want to live that
[1:05:47] way they will I need to do something you
[1:05:50] just need to die you just need to fully
[1:05:52] a real repentance
[1:05:53] turns your heart I mean repentance not
[1:05:56] just I got busted and I'm sorry is
[1:05:58] actually a real repentance turns your
[1:06:00] heart
[1:06:01] hallelujah because otherwise you'll be
[1:06:03] the same person but we all have a free
[1:06:06] moral agency we have a free moral choice
[1:06:07] yeah we all have a free moral choice but
[1:06:10] your nature will govern what you choose
[1:06:12] to do Amen we're not just a bunch of
[1:06:15] blank canvases that I would just do it
[1:06:16] know your nature will govern you so it
[1:06:19] depends what your nature is that's what
[1:06:21] you'll choose that's why we need a
[1:06:23] nature change I mean that's why you know
[1:06:25] man when they're born we have a fallen
[1:06:27] nature that's why man doesn't seek after
[1:06:29] God the scripture is not 1:6 after him
[1:06:32] because their nature is pointing the
[1:06:33] wrong way but then God comes along I'm
[1:06:36] so glad I'm glad it's his work amen and
[1:06:38] cause this unit because you were to give
[1:06:40] yourself over cause you to turn and
[1:06:42] really repent he leads you through the
[1:06:44] repentance and your heart has turned he
[1:06:47] said there's been a change in me this
[1:06:49] jesus hit me free hallelujah that's what
[1:06:53] real repentance is amen now I want you
[1:06:57] to just notice here Enoch it says now he
[1:07:00] lived sixty and five years and beer and
[1:07:02] beget Methuselah and he not what with
[1:07:04] God after he begat methuselah three
[1:07:06] hundred years and he beget sons and
[1:07:08] daughters and all the days of Enoch were
[1:07:10] three hundred sixty and five years and
[1:07:12] he not walk with God here is not for God
[1:07:14] took him now there's no record in the
[1:07:16] scripture of Enoch walking with God the
[1:07:19] first 65 years as just me there's no
[1:07:21] record of it doesn't say he walked with
[1:07:24] God 65 years then he beget Methuselah
[1:07:26] then no there's no record so something
[1:07:28] happened to him when he was 65 years old
[1:07:30] there's just me a meant something
[1:07:33] happened to him and it caused him to
[1:07:35] walk with God hallelujah and he was one
[1:07:39] there were a whole bunch of other people
[1:07:41] upon the earth but yet God chose to walk
[1:07:43] with him amen and
[1:07:46] there's a whole bunch of people upon the
[1:07:47] earth and God chooses to walk with you
[1:07:50] hallelujah amen
[1:07:52] friends if faith I'm just going to
[1:07:55] forgive me if I just jump around but a
[1:07:56] faith is because something's really been
[1:07:58] revealed to you that gives you
[1:07:59] overcoming power against the enemy your
[1:08:02] faith is your victory
[1:08:04] Eliott season and John first John five
[1:08:08] and three for this is the love of God
[1:08:10] that we keep his Commandments and His
[1:08:12] commandments not Grievous for whatsoever
[1:08:15] is born of God overcometh the world and
[1:08:17] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:08:19] world even our faith earlier doesn't say
[1:08:23] that's born of the church that's born of
[1:08:26] God I mean we're not here to make people
[1:08:28] into Shekinah Tabernacle uns Amen or
[1:08:32] little bin blinds this is not the
[1:08:34] purpose of of gathering as that God
[1:08:37] would come and transform us that we
[1:08:40] would become this lived out this is not
[1:08:42] a joining a church you know you can come
[1:08:44] to this church you can still miss it
[1:08:45] it's an individual affair between you
[1:08:48] and God that you must personally meet
[1:08:50] him for yourself
[1:08:52] Alleluia amen so the faith is our
[1:08:56] victory that causes us to overcome no
[1:08:59] she didn't say it's his own ability or
[1:09:00] how you're built it's your faith though
[1:09:04] you're faithful you're Moses he knew
[1:09:07] here's the proper child that's why I
[1:09:09] killed the Egyptian you want to stir
[1:09:10] something up how am I going to deliver
[1:09:12] my people fail but then now God met him
[1:09:15] in the burning bush and it became a life
[1:09:17] to him hallelujah
[1:09:19] and then he went down by faith he went
[1:09:21] down into Egypt 80 years old with a
[1:09:24] stick in his hand with us with us with
[1:09:27] his wife and couple of young boys on a
[1:09:28] donkey where he going Moses I'm going to
[1:09:31] take over think about that magic going
[1:09:34] to Washington today superpower the world
[1:09:36] where you going I'm going to take over
[1:09:38] the thing is he did it because it was
[1:09:40] revealed to him and that whole kingdom
[1:09:42] had to bow to the what he said
[1:09:44] hallelujah
[1:09:46] the whole kingdom he didn't have to work
[1:09:48] it up he was just by led by God and that
[1:09:50] was under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:09:52] how much more how much will them they're
[1:09:55] under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:56] hallelujah you know
[1:09:59] when God speaks that brings order out of
[1:10:01] chaos amen see you see in the beginning
[1:10:04] the world was covered in darkness
[1:10:06] covered in water and then God began to
[1:10:08] speak it was chaos then became an order
[1:10:11] those in Eden amen it's the same thing
[1:10:13] now when God speaks today there can be a
[1:10:16] sickness in a body what is what is a
[1:10:18] disease in a body its itself and it's
[1:10:21] wrong you know as fallen from her how it
[1:10:23] should be into a wrong state so it went
[1:10:26] from order to chaos I mean but there
[1:10:29] within God speaks it takes that chaos
[1:10:31] and puts it back into water Alleluia and
[1:10:35] it's all because he paid for it all on
[1:10:37] Calvary and then he released the power
[1:10:40] amen - to whatever you have need of to
[1:10:44] give it to you so if you're sick you
[1:10:46] know God created you I came to a
[1:10:49] conclusion you know about our daughter
[1:10:52] Emily she had the tongue tie it had to
[1:10:55] be it had to be not just a little one
[1:10:57] but had to really cut and we prayed and
[1:11:00] so I was all booked in for the surgery
[1:11:02] because I believe in medicine - it's all
[1:11:04] booked them for the surgery and we
[1:11:06] prayed I said Lord before the surgeon
[1:11:08] goes to cut her tongue might be gone
[1:11:11] Christine's taking her a week later is a
[1:11:14] bit of mouth blood comes in her mouth
[1:11:16] she says no pain takes her straight
[1:11:18] that's virtually on the way to the
[1:11:21] surgery the surgeon opens the mouth says
[1:11:23] there's no tongue tie here now I just
[1:11:26] came to a conclusion if God can separate
[1:11:28] cells and and lactation could you know a
[1:11:32] lactation consultants is that doesn't
[1:11:34] happen that way completely healthy and
[1:11:35] well he didn't need to cut a little bit
[1:11:37] more help it was just done and I came to
[1:11:40] the conclusion if God can separate cells
[1:11:43] amen he can put them back together he
[1:11:46] can restore house meant to be hallelujah
[1:11:49] we can't limit God friends Alou yeah
[1:11:53] well you've never seen it happen if he's
[1:11:54] done that he can do more amen hallelujah
[1:11:58] yes just what but let's see what you
[1:12:02] speak in faith if it's God it doesn't
[1:12:05] matter how you feel it's not do you feel
[1:12:07] it do you believe it I felt this is a
[1:12:09] post when I prayed that prayer but yet
[1:12:11] God still came upon the scene
[1:12:13] you yeah it's just like Christine she
[1:12:14] had a little white growth on the side of
[1:12:16] her head you know up here and she and
[1:12:19] she would pray against it and then but
[1:12:21] then one day it was quickened to her
[1:12:22] that's not part of her and it fell off
[1:12:24] had some roots didn't darling what
[1:12:27] happened
[1:12:28] her confession her faith now cause that
[1:12:31] thing which not part of it'll everbody
[1:12:34] Alleluia now so faith causes us to
[1:12:39] overcome you say well what you still
[1:12:42] have had enemies had the surgery if God
[1:12:43] didn't do that absolutely she was booked
[1:12:45] in she's on her way so I believe in
[1:12:46] doctors too God gave us good medicine
[1:12:48] but don't limit God just to medicine
[1:12:51] amen now it says in Psalms 37 23 now
[1:12:58] just as you're turning there it says now
[1:13:00] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:13:02] world even our faith so there has to be
[1:13:04] a battle in order for there to be a
[1:13:05] victory if it's just given to you on a
[1:13:07] silver platter that's not a victory
[1:13:09] that's just given to you amen but it has
[1:13:12] to be a Esther be a battle in order to
[1:13:15] have a victory now it says here in
[1:13:18] Psalms 37 23 remember we have a walk
[1:13:22] like Enoch had a walk with God he was
[1:13:25] the shadow you're the reality right and
[1:13:27] it says here in Psalms 37 and 23 the
[1:13:31] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[1:13:33] Lord and he delighteth in his way though
[1:13:36] he fall he shall not be utterly cast
[1:13:39] down for the lord upholdeth him with his
[1:13:41] hand now this word the step yeah the
[1:13:45] word good man here and the in the Hebrew
[1:13:48] it means a valiant man or a warrior
[1:13:51] they can't just it can't just actually
[1:13:53] mean just a person but also means a
[1:13:54] valiant man or a warrior and the root
[1:13:57] word of this Hebrew word it means to be
[1:13:59] strong by implication to prevail Amy sir
[1:14:03] says the steps of a person like this are
[1:14:06] ordered of the Lord hallelujah and he
[1:14:09] delighteth in his way so God the lights
[1:14:11] in his way you know God you know it's
[1:14:13] like we're in a God wants to prove
[1:14:16] himself in your everyday life he wants
[1:14:19] to prove himself and you Amen it's like
[1:14:22] Lord show me your ways and then things
[1:14:23] begin to happen to you because he wants
[1:14:25] to reveal he was
[1:14:26] show himself and what you're going
[1:14:28] through just like we're in a boxing room
[1:14:30] devil you're the devil's our opponent
[1:14:31] but Jesus is our trainer we may go
[1:14:34] around to get knocked down but then we
[1:14:35] go back to the corner because tell us
[1:14:37] they'll do this do this change change
[1:14:38] how you doing things amen
[1:14:41] isn't it that way and then you begin to
[1:14:42] change what you're doing through his
[1:14:44] instruction and then eventually you're
[1:14:46] the devil's face down on the on the mat
[1:14:48] but don't just yo kick him when he's
[1:14:50] down don't let him get back up kick him
[1:14:54] when he's down but God wants a shot he
[1:14:57] wants to prove himself
[1:14:58] you thought Lord show me your ways and
[1:15:00] then he'll allow trials to come and
[1:15:02] hardship and you may not know which way
[1:15:05] to go but he wants to reveal himself to
[1:15:08] you through those things hallelujah so
[1:15:10] if you're looking for him you'll see
[1:15:11] them in your life amen send out the
[1:15:15] steps of a good man are ordered a lord
[1:15:17] so a walkers a we know it's a bunch of
[1:15:19] steps yep
[1:15:21] so God now maybe I just going to turn
[1:15:24] the corner a little bit but you know if
[1:15:26] this is the way if our steps are ordered
[1:15:29] in the good times and the bad times are
[1:15:31] ordered the hard times and the rejoicing
[1:15:34] times are ordered the happy times the
[1:15:36] sad times are ordered it's been
[1:15:38] predetermined your walk has been
[1:15:40] predetermined by God God doesn't get
[1:15:42] surprised when you fall or when
[1:15:43] something happens you know you're in a
[1:15:45] car crash or whatever may happen he's
[1:15:47] not he's not going I didn't see that
[1:15:48] coming because if he didn't see it
[1:15:51] coming he wouldn't be God he wouldn't
[1:15:53] know the end from the beginning
[1:15:54] amen so but we don't we don't always
[1:15:59] look at things that way we think things
[1:16:02] are going well God's please things are
[1:16:03] going bad gods not belief amen but it's
[1:16:08] actually in the bad times is when gods
[1:16:09] really wants to prove himself enjoy the
[1:16:12] good times but also enjoy the bad times
[1:16:15] because the bad times when gods want to
[1:16:17] show himself to you remember Enoch had a
[1:16:20] walk now brother Bram says this in the
[1:16:23] Lamb's Book of Enoch called the Lamb's
[1:16:25] Book of Life of 56 remember its season
[1:16:28] and in the book of Revelation that they
[1:16:30] would not worship the Beast whose names
[1:16:33] are written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:34] in the foundation of the world so
[1:16:36] there's a whole group of names that God
[1:16:38] has written say these are mine
[1:16:40] Amen see if your name is there he said
[1:16:43] how do I know my name is there when God
[1:16:45] spoken to you something quickened in
[1:16:48] your soul amen and that to me that shows
[1:16:52] I don't I'm predestinated because it's
[1:16:54] word has changed me Amen it's not just a
[1:16:57] change of a it's not a mental assent to
[1:16:59] an idea but it's become a living reality
[1:17:02] you know you could learn all about God
[1:17:05] but that's actually totally that's that
[1:17:08] that's futile you got to meet him I
[1:17:11] meant now last book of life he says now
[1:17:14] word is a thought express God begin to
[1:17:16] think as he began to see every human
[1:17:18] being it ever came on earth and every
[1:17:21] bird and every flea and every fly
[1:17:23] hallelujah that makes him the almighty
[1:17:25] eternal ever-present God that's the one
[1:17:27] we serve this morning way back in the
[1:17:30] beginning when he seen that there were
[1:17:32] some people who was going to desire to
[1:17:35] be saved some people who was going to
[1:17:37] want to be saved
[1:17:38] some people who would be loyal in their
[1:17:39] heart they wanted to be saved then he's
[1:17:42] got to make a preparation for their
[1:17:44] salvation that's right or they will
[1:17:46] never be saved and he knows that
[1:17:48] anything imperfect cannot come into
[1:17:50] heaven so he has to make a way of
[1:17:53] perfection for that amen you see it then
[1:17:56] back there he said I myself will come
[1:17:57] down into the world take on human flesh
[1:18:00] I'll pay the penalty that's required
[1:18:02] here I'll take the place I'll make them
[1:18:04] perfect because I'll bring them I'll
[1:18:06] bring them in me and I am perfect then
[1:18:10] when Jesus said be therefore perfect
[1:18:13] even as those which are and even as your
[1:18:15] father in heaven is perfect then here
[1:18:18] was this mangled body that was beaten
[1:18:21] and bruised for sin in every sin that
[1:18:23] the world ever had or ever would have
[1:18:25] was laid upon him and he is the body
[1:18:27] that Jehovah raised up in the last days
[1:18:29] there on the third day after his death
[1:18:31] and if we are in that body was just as
[1:18:33] perfect as the body is amen there you
[1:18:36] are how do I get to that body how do I
[1:18:37] get into it the Bible said in Romans 8:1
[1:18:40] therefore there is no condemnation to
[1:18:42] them that are in Christ Jesus that walk
[1:18:45] not after the flesh but the Spirit they
[1:18:47] don't care what the world says or what
[1:18:49] anybody else is or even what their
[1:18:51] family says they walk in the Spirit of
[1:18:53] God
[1:18:53] perfect divine love you see it how do
[1:18:56] you get into it by joining church by
[1:18:58] shaking hands by water baptism no sir
[1:19:00] the twelfth chapter of 1st Corinthians
[1:19:02] is by one spirit all baptized into one
[1:19:05] body and become members of that body
[1:19:07] then it's not what I've done what I am
[1:19:10] who I was or nothing about it that's
[1:19:12] what God has done for me in Christ and
[1:19:14] we are perfect with our sacrifice he
[1:19:16] makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you
[1:19:19] in if he wasn't worthy he knows your
[1:19:21] heart that's right he knows what you are
[1:19:23] he knows your motives he knows what you
[1:19:26] are
[1:19:26] there's traps all along the road sure
[1:19:29] the devil will cause you to stumble and
[1:19:32] you say god I didn't mean to do that
[1:19:34] God you know it you're still perfect
[1:19:36] because there's a perfect blood offered
[1:19:39] for you every day and a bleeding
[1:19:41] sacrifice hanging before the throne of
[1:19:44] Almighty God that's right how do you get
[1:19:47] in there God by foreknowledge now God
[1:19:50] said that Jesus now put on your caps
[1:19:52] open your heart look the Bible said that
[1:19:54] Jesus was slain at the lamb slain from
[1:19:57] where the foundation of the world here
[1:19:59] slayed way God the Father when he looked
[1:20:01] down and seen how Jesus never come just
[1:20:04] to die haphazard death and you ever come
[1:20:06] to say well maybe somebody will have
[1:20:08] pity when they see the way I die and
[1:20:10] everything naught wasn't God doesn't run
[1:20:12] his business like that God runs his
[1:20:15] business perfect that's right he note
[1:20:17] exactly what was going to take place
[1:20:20] that's where he could for say he knows
[1:20:22] exactly what he he's not willing that
[1:20:24] any should perish he's not willing but
[1:20:26] if he's infinite he knows who will and
[1:20:28] who won't therefore you can rest assure
[1:20:31] if you receive God and been filled with
[1:20:33] the Holy Spirit you're anchored to your
[1:20:35] eternal destination correctly he for
[1:20:38] know how lujah no job joke said I'll
[1:20:45] wait to my point of days until my change
[1:20:47] come so he was waiting in a place he was
[1:20:50] waiting just in life until until death
[1:20:53] until has changed come now we are not in
[1:20:57] that same kind of bracket because he
[1:21:00] didn't know what was coming thank you
[1:21:02] very much he did not know at
[1:21:07] at stage of his walk what what what is
[1:21:10] there beyond this beyond this world but
[1:21:13] then after God came and spoke to me says
[1:21:15] now I know my Redeemer liveth amen and I
[1:21:18] will stand with him that day on the
[1:21:19] earth amazed I'll see God with my eyes
[1:21:22] I'll see God so he had a revelation
[1:21:24] though that it wasn't just now I'm just
[1:21:27] going to wait here until my until I die
[1:21:29] but he knew that there was a place
[1:21:31] Hereafter
[1:21:31] now Jesus had a walk in this world he
[1:21:36] had a walk in this world God the word
[1:21:38] God became flesh and dwelt among us
[1:21:40] we're not saved by the blood of a Jew
[1:21:42] we're not saved by the blood of the
[1:21:44] Gentile we're saved by the blood of God
[1:21:46] that was shed amen he was he was not a
[1:21:48] Jew if not a Gentile he was God as a man
[1:21:51] God became flesh and dwelt among us now
[1:21:53] his ministry started with death because
[1:21:57] Jordan is always a type of death in his
[1:22:00] baptized in the River Jordan says
[1:22:01] ministry started with a death and ended
[1:22:04] with his death physically you're humanly
[1:22:06] speaking his walk was a denial of self
[1:22:10] amen he says if any man be my disciple
[1:22:13] you take up your cross deny yourself
[1:22:15] take up your cross and follow me and he
[1:22:17] doesn't make people do things that he
[1:22:18] hasn't done himself already a mentor was
[1:22:21] a walk of self-denial
[1:22:22] but you see and a walk of death but he
[1:22:25] had to do that in order for you to walk
[1:22:27] with God for him to walk with you now
[1:22:31] here he was and he took on it says in
[1:22:34] Hebrews 2 he has made a little lower
[1:22:36] than the Angels they came as the seed of
[1:22:38] Abraham became a man and using death he
[1:22:42] took it that he might destroy the power
[1:22:45] of death that is the devil who took
[1:22:46] death upon himself I mean to destroy the
[1:22:49] power of death that he would deliver us
[1:22:52] and deliver them who through fear of
[1:22:54] death were all their lifetime subject to
[1:22:56] bondage so he delivered us because you
[1:22:59] know if man is man is scared without
[1:23:02] knowing Jesus Christ people are scared
[1:23:04] where am I going to go I don't know you
[1:23:06] know when they come down to the last few
[1:23:07] moments they realize what's really
[1:23:09] happening but the believer we're not
[1:23:11] afraid
[1:23:12] amen Anna Anna but Christians can still
[1:23:15] be afraid if they don't really know him
[1:23:18] a mint because you know I know some
[1:23:21] people they're afraid Oh am I doing this
[1:23:23] right am i doing this right you know is
[1:23:24] this and they and their whole life is
[1:23:26] just a whole bunch of fear am i pleasing
[1:23:28] or I'm not bleating in they're all like
[1:23:30] treading on eggshells the whole time
[1:23:32] because they don't know because the fear
[1:23:34] hasn't been taken away perfect love
[1:23:36] casts out fear cuz this all right now he
[1:23:41] says oh Jesus now because many times we
[1:23:44] want to hold onto things because others
[1:23:47] say well you don't know what I've lived
[1:23:48] through yeah some people don't are not
[1:23:51] willing to give things over to him
[1:23:53] because they well you don't know where
[1:23:54] I've been through you wouldn't
[1:23:54] understand my walk Jesus I just think
[1:23:57] that's the other weekend I was just
[1:23:58] rejoicing Jesus died as a sinner I meant
[1:24:02] when he was crying out my god my god was
[1:24:04] out forsaken me it was just I have to
[1:24:07] fulfill some prophecy that will speak
[1:24:08] you meet but he was generally crying
[1:24:10] that up he died as a sinner taking your
[1:24:13] sin upon himself here so he actually
[1:24:15] died lost in a way amen he died as a
[1:24:19] sinner in your place you've never
[1:24:21] experienced that and he took your son
[1:24:23] down to hell amen
[1:24:25] oh you wouldn't understand he's been
[1:24:27] through far worse that we have been
[1:24:29] through and that and to me that is far
[1:24:31] more terrifying than just just the
[1:24:32] beatings and the scourging and the
[1:24:34] crucifixion I mean because that's just
[1:24:37] human pain that's not going into an
[1:24:39] endless eternity hallelujah
[1:24:42] so he died in our place as a sinner and
[1:24:44] he took our sins to hell that's why we
[1:24:47] can sing living he loved me dying he
[1:24:49] saved me buried he carried my sins far
[1:24:51] away rising he justified me freely
[1:24:53] forever one day is coming oh glorious
[1:24:55] day hallelujah
[1:24:58] now there is a place for the believer
[1:25:02] job said I'll wait my appointed days
[1:25:04] until my change come now the believer
[1:25:07] has a very different kind of in this
[1:25:10] hour we're not just living out life
[1:25:12] until we die yeah but we are heading
[1:25:16] away in Christ Jesus it's got a
[1:25:19] Deuteronomy 16 and 1 there is a place of
[1:25:22] worship that God has ordained and it's
[1:25:26] not four walls of a building amen
[1:25:29] I've talked about individual believers
[1:25:30] now
[1:25:31] he says in its own judor army sixteen
[1:25:33] and one now if you're in this place you
[1:25:39] can just let off the pressure if you're
[1:25:41] in this place a many seas now observe
[1:25:44] the month of ever see this goes beyond
[1:25:46] it goes beyond well I understand
[1:25:48] doctrine Amen or I live a moral life
[1:25:53] it goes beyond there we should live a
[1:25:55] clean moral life because we love him I
[1:25:56] mean we should understand he says when
[1:25:58] the spirit of truth is come here Legion
[1:26:00] guide you into all truth so you should
[1:26:02] understand doctrine but it's more than
[1:26:03] that because if you're just in a in a
[1:26:06] just just living a living a life that's
[1:26:09] one kind of place that's one kind of
[1:26:11] position you're in but if you're in this
[1:26:14] place this is where you need to be
[1:26:16] observed the month of abbath and keep
[1:26:18] the Passover unto the Lord thy God from
[1:26:21] the month of Abbot the LORD thy God
[1:26:22] brought thee forth out of Egypt by night
[1:26:25] thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[1:26:27] Passover answer the LORD thy God and of
[1:26:29] the flocking of the heard and the place
[1:26:31] which the LORD hath chose to place his
[1:26:33] name there notice a place God chose to
[1:26:35] place his name thou shall eat no
[1:26:37] leavened bread with it seven days shalt
[1:26:39] thou eat unleavened bread therefore even
[1:26:41] the bread of affliction for thou camest
[1:26:43] forth out of the land of Egypt and hast
[1:26:45] that thou mayst remember the day when
[1:26:47] thou comest forth our land of Egypt all
[1:26:50] the days of thy life and there shall be
[1:26:51] no leavened bread seen within all biko
[1:26:54] seven days neither shall there be
[1:26:56] anything of the flesh which else we
[1:26:58] shall sacrifice us the first day it even
[1:27:01] remain all night until the morning
[1:27:03] thou mayst not sacrifice the Passover
[1:27:06] within within any of thy gates which the
[1:27:09] LORD thy God has given thee but the
[1:27:10] place which the LORD thy God shall
[1:27:12] choose to place his name it there thou
[1:27:15] shalt sacrifice the Passover it even at
[1:27:18] the going down of the Sun even at the
[1:27:21] season when thou come us forth out of
[1:27:24] Egypt Amen see he's saying no there's a
[1:27:27] place where you must sacrifice where I
[1:27:29] have put my name right so God is
[1:27:33] actually designating a place that you
[1:27:35] must be to sacrifice right it's not just
[1:27:39] any old place it's not where you have
[1:27:40] put your name but it's where God has put
[1:27:42] his own name that's where you must
[1:27:45] that's the place you must be in Alleluia
[1:27:48] and so it's very quite simple Jesus came
[1:27:51] and he said I come in my father's name
[1:27:53] and you received me not what is the name
[1:27:56] of the Father Jesus you know he he had
[1:28:00] lots of down through the Old Testament
[1:28:02] he was known as Jehovah I mean he has
[1:28:04] done as as Elohim else Shetty I you know
[1:28:08] he had many different titles but his
[1:28:10] name the greatest revelation of who God
[1:28:12] is is Jesus Jehovah Savior and it's not
[1:28:15] just to save from from sickness or or a
[1:28:18] physical salvation like the Israelites
[1:28:21] are taken out of Egypt but it's but it's
[1:28:23] a spiritual salvation where people can
[1:28:25] be delivered from from the bondage of
[1:28:28] fear and death and be translators the
[1:28:30] scripture says into the kingdom of a son
[1:28:32] I'll either they can be taken so there's
[1:28:35] no fear there shouldn't be no fear in
[1:28:36] our lives if this heart fails right now
[1:28:39] I'm ready
[1:28:41] I trust you have that revelation in your
[1:28:43] soul I'll loose you say no there's a
[1:28:46] place where God has chosen to put his
[1:28:48] name and so God put his name in his son
[1:28:50] Jesus Christ that's the place that he
[1:28:53] put his name and the only way you can
[1:28:55] get into that place has to be baptized
[1:28:57] with the Holy Spirit of God that's how
[1:29:00] you get into that place hallelujah and
[1:29:02] if you're in that place friends you've
[1:29:05] you've won you've won the game of life
[1:29:08] hallelujah
[1:29:09] you've yeah you've come to the place you
[1:29:11] really need to be in you know when the
[1:29:13] disciples went into the upper room
[1:29:15] hallelujah that same God that was on
[1:29:17] Calvary that ascended on high came down
[1:29:20] in another form and dwelt in them and
[1:29:22] they became God's place of worship
[1:29:25] Olu you I mean God was in them and he
[1:29:30] became that was God's chosen place of
[1:29:32] worship was being in Jesus Christ
[1:29:35] Allu you Amen no it's yours he sees in
[1:29:39] God's provided place of worship he says
[1:29:42] they were quickened into the prints of
[1:29:43] God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:46] God's quickening power baptized them
[1:29:48] into that they were in the place of
[1:29:50] worship then they were where they could
[1:29:52] actually worship amen it's more than
[1:29:55] just coming to a building this is not
[1:29:57] you know
[1:29:58] you have to be in Christ to really
[1:30:00] worship God that's very elementary but
[1:30:04] you must be in him to really worship Him
[1:30:06] because that's where God said this is
[1:30:08] whether this is where you're going to
[1:30:10] this is where you're going to offer the
[1:30:12] you know Passover and we have what

[1:30:38] Creed's and dogmas of man but you got to
[1:30:40] be in Jesus Christ and Christ as his
[1:30:42] word Alleluia so if we are if we are in
[1:30:46] that place of worship
[1:30:47] now worshipper has has some very you
[1:30:50] know a worshiper has has rights yeah if
[1:30:54] their worship is accepted then God can
[1:30:56] step on their behalf and help them
[1:30:58] Alleluia I mean but if God doesn't
[1:31:01] accept the worship Abel Abel by faith
[1:31:04] Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice

[1:31:10] lost when he was murdered but he went up

[1:42:40] I'll have the ability that I can't fault
[1:42:42] that did anymore I mean it's the same
[1:42:44] thing with us God can justify us but if

[1:42:56] whom doesn't come into us then we can
[1:42:58] become unsanctified
[1:42:59] because it's our nature you following me
[1:43:02] but if he comes and dwells in you alert

[1:43:27] happens with us that you're in Christ
[1:43:29] you've won everything your fallen ear to
[1:43:32] all things as well so you got to really
[1:43:35] look by faith and look what belongs to
[1:43:37] you I mean but we're not just like Jobe
[1:43:40] I'll wait here until my change comes
[1:43:43] amen in a way because we're not just
[1:43:46] waiting for for the clock to tick around
[1:43:48] you know you you come into this place
[1:43:51] right you come into this place you're
[1:43:54] waiting for a body change you're under
[1:43:56] expectation for a body change sure but
[1:43:58] now it's like now what belongs to me
[1:44:00] you're not just sitting back I trust you

[1:44:05] searches out the deeper things of God
[1:44:07] Alleluia I want more of a reality I want
[1:44:12] more of a reality I just don't want to
[1:44:14] go service after service and we have
[1:44:16] this and we have this and I want God to
[1:44:18] be more real I don't just want to have
[1:44:20] camp experiences at camp or convention
[1:44:23] experiences at conventions it should be
[1:44:25] every Sunday that's my expectation
[1:44:27] that's what I want
[1:44:29] hallelujah now I've just finished with
[1:44:35] this I don't know work what the time is
[1:44:37] but he says now this is in the deity of
[1:44:40] Jesus Christ he says the Son of God that
[1:44:45] was in the cradle is in the heart now
[1:44:46] he's the deity of God he's God the
[1:44:49] Creator he was in the world and the
[1:44:51] world was made by him in the world knew
[1:44:53] him not and today that's what's the
[1:44:55] matter with the church the hope of glory
[1:44:56] the baptism of the holy ghost has come
[1:44:58] into the people's hearts and they don't
[1:45:00] recognize what it is they think it's a
[1:45:02] little Church joining or something like
[1:45:03] that but that is the the God the Creator
[1:45:07] living in you and giving you all the
[1:45:09] power and you're in possession of
[1:45:11] everything that he had so then you to
[1:45:13] abstain from evil to do good to shun
[1:45:15] evil
[1:45:16] and flee to righteousness to turn away
[1:45:19] from temptation or malice hatred strife
[1:45:21] envy so forth come away from it and that
[1:45:23] all and that'll take him from your heart
[1:45:26] if you receive them embrace them and
[1:45:27] love them and hold them in your heart
[1:45:29] and love them I tell you the church
[1:45:31] together and that kind of a power has
[1:45:34] the power to bind the heavens to heal
[1:45:36] the sick to open the eyes of the blind
[1:45:39] hallelujah the Deaf speak that I've
[1:45:41] cited so the dumb speak the Deaf hear
[1:45:43] the cripples walk the blind see why it's
[1:45:46] recognizing the power of your mighty God
[1:45:48] into your heart there hears the deity he
[1:45:52] says do you love them amen I'll finish
[1:45:55] with this note you may think sometimes
[1:46:00] we we sit and we listen we think I could
[1:46:03] not how could I even grab that I can I
[1:46:07] can't get it's here somewhere
[1:46:09] and the dear voice is where you don't
[1:46:10] hear somewhere you can't you've know
[1:46:12] you're not worthy enough to actually lay
[1:46:13] hold of that and I'll say this I've said
[1:46:16] it a few dives but Jacob wanted the
[1:46:19] birthright what do you want this morning
[1:46:22] he wanted the birthright so Ennis but he
[1:46:27] was born second so he couldn't he
[1:46:29] there's no way he could have received it
[1:46:31] it was impossible for him to receive
[1:46:33] that birthright he couldn't go on before
[1:46:35] his father and say give me the
[1:46:36] birthright as far as you say I can't
[1:46:39] give it to you you're not my firstborn
[1:46:40] son right it was impossible and so now
[1:46:44] here he comes and his mother says now
[1:46:47] dress up like your older brother Esau so
[1:46:51] basically deny yourself cover yourself
[1:46:54] with the with the goat skins put on
[1:46:56] Esau's jacket and things gone before
[1:46:58] your blind father that you can receive
[1:47:01] what you need and so remember his daddy
[1:47:04] was a prophet God could have shown him
[1:47:07] this is this is Jacob he's lying to you
[1:47:10] he's trying to deceive you so he Leah he
[1:47:13] would he would have got in there with
[1:47:14] fear yeah he would have gone there with
[1:47:16] fear but yet his heart was I want the
[1:47:19] birthright what do you have need of this
[1:47:21] morning I just want to challenge you
[1:47:23] what do you have need of you say well I
[1:47:24] can't obtain healing or deliverance or
[1:47:27] salvation I can't I have no right to go
[1:47:29] Oh God and get that I'm unworthy I'm
[1:47:31] just a man I remember he became a man he
[1:47:34] came down in your place amen and he felt
[1:47:37] it to all things and Jacob denied
[1:47:40] himself denied who he was he goes in
[1:47:43] before as you know as far this is who
[1:47:45] are you says I'm Esau he didn't know who
[1:47:48] he was deny his condition and whatever
[1:47:51] state he is and he says I am your older
[1:47:53] son amen and God honored it and God gave
[1:47:59] him the birthright and God blessed them
[1:48:02] amen because in his heart was I want the
[1:48:05] birthright but he had to deny himself
[1:48:07] and what he thought about himself
[1:48:10] amen take on the identity of his older
[1:48:12] brother to receive what he needed and
[1:48:15] it's the same thing today because we
[1:48:17] look at ourselves I look at myself
[1:48:18] saying I can't how can i how can this
[1:48:22] body be changed how can I walk in at you
[1:48:25] know an overcoming life how can I
[1:48:27] receive healing or deliverance or
[1:48:29] whatever I did off I'm not worthy to
[1:48:31] receive it you're looking at the wrong
[1:48:33] guy amen
[1:48:36] he went in and got what he needed how
[1:48:39] about you amen if you ever need this
[1:48:43] morning you're welcome to come for
[1:48:45] prayer but it's according to your faith
[1:48:47] EEMA jesus paid it all pay for
[1:48:50] everything he didn't have to pay any
[1:48:53] more interest off he paid it in full who
[1:48:55] paid for all healing he paid for the
[1:48:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost he paid for
[1:49:00] overcoming power he paid for a people to
[1:49:03] be restored back what they should be in
[1:49:04] he he paid for dominion over Satan hell
[1:49:08] death and the grave Amen he yo you know
[1:49:11] he paid for all the love joy peace
[1:49:13] longsuffering all those different things
[1:49:15] amen whatever you have need of he's
[1:49:18] already paid for it and brother Bram
[1:49:20] says that faith in the finished work of
[1:49:23] Calvary unlocks every promise Amen so
[1:49:28] it's for it's not in faith of what you
[1:49:29] are it's faith in what he has done Amen
[1:49:33] Alleluia and and the reason you say well
[1:49:37] how do I know he did it
[1:49:38] well I know he died on the cross because
[1:49:40] he transformed me

[1:49:46] man how do you know that you know the
[1:49:48] anointing was come to bind up the
[1:49:50] brokenhearted at liberty them that are
[1:49:51] bruised I've seen it happen amen so and
[1:49:56] if he's done it before
[1:49:57] he'll do it again baby you say well I'm
[1:50:00] not worth it you just got to give
[1:50:01] yourself over to him don't be afraid to
[1:50:03] let go

[1:50:08] me I know wise cast out that's what he
[1:50:10] said all that come to I know wise cast
[1:50:12] out so he can't say that and do
