isn't he lovely isn't he wonderful amen he sure is amen thanks brother ed thank you musicians amen god bless you welcome to this prayer meeting trust everyone's happy and well um amen so we're just going to listen to a portion if you we'll just read the scripture then um we're going to um so we're going to go to revelation 6 and we're going to read from verse 12 down to verse 17 so we're just going through the seven seals and um i actually found it quite difficult to find a portion of this message to you know say this is this is the whole message within the message because it's so much in the six seals message to um yeah so um so anyway let's just read here so revelation 6 and verse 12. so we read as we went through the fifth seal last time it says here and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and though there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of here and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell onto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together and every mountain and ireland were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men every bond man every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand amen sisters bow heads and word of prayer gracious heavenly father i'm just very thankful that what we're about to hear tonight we don't have to be in lord jesus because we know this is during jacob's trouble or the great tribulation time but you promised there'd be a bride on the earth that would not taste death but would walk with you and would be not lord because you'll take her away lord jesus you will keep her from this great wrath that you're going to pour out upon the earth so that's why i can say thank you lord i don't i don't have to go there lord because you've made a way lord jesus for us to escape that wrath to come and go to be with you for eternity but dear god i still ask dear lord may you anoint this father to our hearts may it live in our lives lord jesus lord may it stir us up father knowing that soon and very soon lord these scriptures will be fulfilled lord they may have been sitting in prophecy for hundreds and hundreds of years but now has come the time soon will be that it will be fulfilled so i pray give us real heart for this world and everyone we come in contact with oh god that lord through much prayer we can seek and seek after those whose names are written in the land's book of life and whosoever will lord jesus that they would come and drink of the waters of life freely father and meet you so may you granted i pray we thank you for this evening lord also ask for the prayer time we're about to have after this as well lord may not be us praying but mate you'll be praying through us lord there's many needs oh god this world is reeling under heavy things but i pray to god that you would take our voices and our lips and our tongues and just pray what you would have prayed granted for your glory lord in jesus christ's name amen means you may have your seats i just thought very briefly to um kind of overlap from last because it's been a while since we went through the fifth seal because we had locked down and now here we are and um so the fifth seal we know are the souls under the altar which are the jews which they receive eternal life because they stood for the word of god and the testimony that they held it's not christians because they're crying as souls under the altar saying how long until god you avenge your blood you know so they're calling out for vengeance and we know christians cannot call out for revenge but they call out for mercy amen that man is a bit of a you know don't just look at me yeah that's how we should be remember jesus jesus when he was dying on the cross he'd father forgive them they don't know what they do stephen was being stoned he said lord do not lay this to their charge so that's how we should be so the souls under the altar and the fifth seal they are jews and it ties into where um it says in matthew 24 when the lord we know he's asked three questions when will be the destruction of the temple the sign of his coming in the end of the world and through matthew 24 25 he answers those questions but but he says here in matthew 24 and 29 says immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes the earth mourn they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory so this here so it says after the tribulation of those days now this is not the great tribulation this is the tribula the amateur tribulation brother brahm calls it that happened during world war ii that was an amateur tribulation and if you've ever looked at or looked at documentaries or studied world war ii if that's an amateur tribulation i don't want to be when it's the if i can say not saying it as a joke but the full real life tribulation because that was incredibly what i know how many million tens of millions of people lost their lives in that carnage and so this tribulation of those days is that and this is where the um the souls under the altar part of that portion of them were killed under brotherhood says under the eichmann and you know you know hitler in different ones how they wanted to exterminate the jews so um but then they had to rest a while till their fellow servants are also killed as well which we understand i believe is 144 000 in the great tribulation period but in the great tribulation period there are 144 000 jews are called because the dispensation of grace has already ended to the gentiles that's winding up right now i'm thank god we're in if you're in praise the lord you want to be the most help happy person in all the world that you got in before the door shut hallelujah but remember the reason you gotten is because god called you and you responded to that call but don't don't be called and not respond pick up the phone swipe to answer say here i am lord i don't mean that as a joke but you know if he's calling respond amen more than anything else you want to get in and then just thank god you're in and then have a burden for everyone else on the outside but just thank god you're in um and so uh yeah so the dispensation so in the great tribulation time there's no there's no salvation for the gentiles because god has turned back to the jews and that's why israel is a nation again because there will be 144 000 jews in the promised land amen that will receive the same lord jesus christ we have glory amen and we know that uh just this sixth seal here is also the time of jacob's trouble as it's called in the old testament or the great tribulation where there's a great interruption of nature that's what we just read and the two prophets that actually you could say open the seal brother brown says is the two witnesses of revelations 11 which is the ministry of moses and elijah that return back to the jews because a real jew will only accept a prophet so so when we're in the wedding supper in the sky then god sends these prophets or anoints their ministry or you know because i believe they're possibly already on the earth right now right they must be there you know brother brown at the age of 37 even though god was dealing with him through the you know through his life at the age of 37 he met the lord in the cave and god commissioned him to take the two gifts of healing you know in his hand and discernment to take the gift of healing to the world and it sparked a revival so he was walking around for 37 years wondering about his life and you know all these supernatural things happening and then finally at the right time because remember at the same time brother brown was called in 1946 47. someone helped me yep 47. yep israel became a nation in 1948 right and the world council of churches really formed at that time as well so here was a prophet seen to call the bride for the lord jesus israel became a nation in the homeland and then the world council of churches the tears were beginning to be bound everything being orchestrated by the scripture everything everything coming together as the same thing in the great tribulation there will be the wrath of the lamb is pulled out poured out upon the world but in israel the 144 thousand being sealed by the holy ghost i mean under the ministry of moses and elijah and at that same time we're in the wedding sap in the sky rejoicing so the sixth seal just to condense it before we listen to this because i thought i better kind of give a real brief overview because it's hard i found it as i said hard to find a snippet within the message that it you know this is the whole like a whole thought condensed into a bit um so it's a great interruption of nature brother braham says that the ones that really open the seal are the two prophets because you know both the ministry of moses and elijah were an interruption of nature moses yeah i mean i mean yeah moses darkness upon egypt turn turn the nile into blood you know all those you know hail came down great you know interruption of nature elijah said not one bit of jewel rain will fall till i call for it interruption of nature and that's what these ones will do they'll just plague the whole earth fire it says comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemy all these things happen and but then it says that they are killed and they lay on the in in jerusalem it says for i think three three days and the whole world sees it now can you ask ever was a time when the whole world can watch an event live i wonder what's happening with those two dead bodies and you know and you can just watch it the whole world can watch it even in the back blocks of new guinea they can live stream things you know so it's the whole world and but then they see then they're resurrected and they get taken up into heaven but this is the season because the technology technology is here for the whole world to see it but thank god we're not here i'm so glad that the lord found us to say you don't have to go through this i took your great tribulation i took that judgment on the cross for you that you don't have to suffer and go through amen because remember he took our judgment on calvary the wrath of god was put out upon him that we should have received hallelujah because god's law must uh you know what's the law without a punishment so so the law said they either of they you shall die i mean to the lord jesus our lord jesus took that punishment upon himself that we don't have to die as a sinner we don't have to go to hell he took that for us that we can go to heaven so thanks be to god for this great hour amen so without further ado god bless you but yeah i encourage you go listen to the whole whole tape if you haven't already [Music] [Music] that's our head just a moment [Music] lord we are again gathering it for the service and we think of the time in the early days when they all come up to shiloh for the blessings of the lord and now tonight we have assembled here to hear your word and as we have been studying in this certain portion of the scripture that the lamb was the only one that could open the seals or to loose them but we find out now that israel in that time of trouble when he was jacob he wrestled with the got a hold of something that was real there was a man come down jacob got his arms around him and he stayed there and the thought said i must be going that's coming daylight oh that breaking of the day but jacob said i'm not going to leave you you just can't go i'm going to stay right with you i won't things change here that's that 144 000 that money scheming bunch and things like that when they see the true genuine thing to get a hold of their stands moses and their sins elijah amen they'll wrestle with god until 144 000 of the tribes of israel are called out right now [Music] that's just before the tribulation period oh how wonderful also jacob's trouble here is when the and forty four thousand is called out the the the preachers and two prophets they preached like john the baptist the kingdom of heaven is a hand repent israel repent what repent from your sins your unbelief and turn back to god now let us remember something here these great happenings the nature has happened before in this uh 12th verse here see the sun became as black as sackcloth of hair now compare this now remember that does not happen in the gentile it's israel let me show you i remember i said it's calling out to 144 000. this time now it's what is the tribulation which is to do it and this is telling what happens in this tribulation now let's turn to exodus 10 21-23 and watch here when exodus is when of course israel was coming out going to be taken out exodus the 10th chapter and the 21st 23rd verse i'm so excited to shout and want to write these notes down and sometimes i might get them mixed up all right exodus 10 21-23 all right here we go 21 and 23 and the lord said unto moses stretch forth on hand towards heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt and moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven and there came a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days now they saw not one another neither rose any from his place or three days but the children of israel had lied in their dwellings notice zach come over here and the sun became as black as sacral the same thing these happenings of nature what was it what when that nature happens like this has been god calling israel see god's calling out israel now son is black is hair now god was about to deliver israel there all right bring them out of their enemy's hand which was egypt at that time now here he is bringing them out of the roman hand where they made their covenant same thing happens that's the plagues that the time in this plague will call it'll plague this uh group of gentiles if we had time i could show what's going to happen to that gentile church the bible said that the the dragon satan was rough that's angry with the woman the jew israel and he spreading water from his mouth thickness and multitudes of people that went to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed revelations 13 9 see there we have that and that's when israel sends her i mean rome sends her army after the remnant the remnant of the woman's seat now watch the first time there are enemies hands when he's delivered about his son turn to sac the black is cycle now this is the second time the end of the tribulation period now in daniel 12 if we had time we could read it and daniel the 12th the 12th verse 12th chapter other daniel said every one that was found written in the book would be delivered i remember daniel is now speaking of this period when this this thing is supposed to happen when israel is to be delivered when the the end of their 70th week and that's when they're supposed to be delivered now look unless we get to daniel 12 here just a minute and at that time michael shall stand up the great prince which stood for the children for or the children of thy people see that's jews and there shall be a trouble such never was since there was a nation even to that same time now compare that exactly what jesus said matthew 24. there shall be a time of trouble has never been since there was a nation look at this sixth seal see the same thing a time of trouble notice since there wasn't even to the same time and at that time thy people now in this seven last part of the seventh year thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book the predestinated you see it's written in the lamb's book of life shall be delivered at that time and many of those that sleep in the dust the earth shall await and some to everlasting life and someday everlasting shame and contentment now and then shall the wise shine as a brightness of the firmaments and and they that turn many to righteous shall disguise the stars forever and ever that the way he had told daniel shut up the book where he'd be resting in his lot for that time now see don't make it everywhere you live or die you come forth anyhow he don't dying isn't nothing to a christian he don't die anyhow now daniel 12 said that everyone that was found written in the book would be delivered here god is about to deliver his second son israel after the tribulation see the second time israel is israel is his son you know that israel is god's son so he's going to deliver him here in the tribulation period just exactly the way he did down in egypt now let's stop here again and get something else so before we bring it into home now watch your these two prophets look what they're going to do now just like moses and them did down there and there was giving me a read and um the third verse the 11th chapter and i will give power to my two witnesses that they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees you remember that zero elements were worth was reveal the temple and the two candlesticks that stand before the god of the earth if any man hurt them fire proceeded out of their mouth remember out of the mouth of christ comes the sword word thereby their enemies and if any man shall hurt them he must in this manner be killed now we know the fire in the 19th chapter of the coming of christ proceeded his sword from his mouth which was the word is that right the word oh if you get this material now for that seal tomorrow night see the word is a thing that god slays his enemy by amen see now look here when these prophets are prophesying they're they if any man mistreats them harms them far proceeds from their mouth holy ghost fire the word the word is god word is fire word is the spirit see proceeds from a mouth look at moses let's see what come from his mouth they israel got to the way they were doing that the i mean egypt they were mistreating these jews moses they wouldn't let him go pharaoh wouldn't god put the words and mows his mouth see it's god's thoughts going into moses heart he goes over now to express it that becomes a word stretch his hand for that let that be flies here come flies look here and if any man hurt are proceeded out of their mouth and devour their enemy see there it is they can speak what they want to and there it happens amen if any man hurt them they must in this manner be killed brother god rides on the scene here they have power to uh uh power to shut the heavens that it rain not in the days of their prophecy elijah he knows how to do it he's done it before amen moses knows how to do it he's done it before that's where he just kept back now hey amen i could say something awful good right here but better hold it for a moment all right and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with plagues as off as they will what is it god can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to here it is they're the one who brings on this sixth seal they uncover and open it up it's a power of god [Music] this interrupt nature see the sixth seal is completely an interruption of nature do you get it now there's your seal who doesn't it's the prophets the other side of the rapture with the power of god the word of god they just condemn nature they can stand earthquakes turn the moon into blood the sun can go down or anything of their commands hey there you are there you are see see how the seals open down there in the church age how to show the martyrs and now here's these two prophets stand here with the word of god to do anything the nature they want to and they shake the earth it shows exactly who does it it's moses and elijah because there's our ministry re-impersonated again both man oh my do you see it now see what the sixth seal is it's those prophets now notice don't let it choke you but watch what open that seal prophets [Applause] [Music] they open that sixth seal they have power to do it hey man [Music] there's your sixth seal coming open see now we dropped baker and jesus spoke it would take place way back down in the old testament back in ezekiel back in the old prophets they spoke it would take place and here the sixth seal opened and say well that's a mysterious thing what did it here's the secret of it the prophets because the bible said so here they can open it anytime they do anything in nature they want to and they do the same thing they did do because they know how it's done amen glory to god i seen that i just raised out of church i walked down the floor i thought lord how i thank you heavenly father there it is that's it [Music] they opened that sick seal amen watch them if any man hurt that farm to see it out of their mouth the word holy ghost come up on the apostles you see fire perceive thy amount now notice over in revelations 19 we see the same thing and a great sword proceed from his mouth word christ's coming and he slayed his enemies with it is that right eyes on his road watching now all right these have power to shut the heavens that it rain not in the days of their prophecy oh that's interrupting nature now how long did uh did this man uh elijah close the heavens far there you are exactly how long's daniel's 70 last part of the 70 weeks there you are exactly what did moses do he it he turned the waters into blood he done all these kind of miracles just exactly what's predicted here under this sixth seal amen and here they are in revelations 11 doing the very same thing amen there's three different places in the scriptures out there blending the thing right together that's the opening of the sixth seal right there it is hallelujah amen glory i noticed these have power to shut the heavens and days of their prophecies about it won't rain and power over the waters to turn them to blood to smite the earth with flags as of as they will oh my there you are now turn over here to the place see all nature is interrupted in this six plague or sixth seal open it's exactly what happened now look the yeah god is about to deliver his son israel after the same manner of the tribulation that he did down there he sent moses down there and delivered israel is that right and he done these very same things he sent elijah to ahab seven thousand come out that right he sends him right back over here again at the time of the tribulation and calls out the hundred and forty four thousand i see you notice between revelation between the sixth chapter of the sixth flag seal party the sixth seal and the seventh seal the seventh chapter of revelation mathematically set together right just like america is number 13 13 states is started with 13 stars in the flag 13 colonies 13 stripes everything's 13 13 and it appears right here in the 13th chapter of revelations that's right she's 13 and a woman now when he was about to deliver his only begotten son which was his only begotten jacob is his son but this is the only begotten son matthew 27 let's see what he did there matthew the 27th chapter now remember his son had been beaten and had been troubled and they had made fun of him and he was now hanging on the cross at three o'clock on good friday afternoon just about to take place matthew 27 chapter of matthew and the the 45th verse i believe it is now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour now notice just exactly what he did back here now in this sea and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal low there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon and the moon became his blood blackness darkness egypt blackness darkness god delivering jesus at the cross this before he brought him up to the resurrection first darkness sun went out in the middle of the day stars wouldn't shine two days samantha's gonna raise him up with a mighty triumph at the sun and moon and stars and everything in egypt all these taking place he delivered israel to the promised land here isn't a tribulation spirit here stands them prophets to who has the control of the word that god gives them they can only speak as god gives them the word amen now they're not gods they're temporarily uh amateurly they are because jesus said they were said you call them gods who the word of god came but look that's the one that god brings the word to and when he speaks it it happens amen that's all and here he is with the commission from god to smite the earth whatever he wants to oh [Music] stop the heavens and he does what's the matter he's fixing to take the 144 thousand out for redemption out of the book of redemption and that's under the seal of redemption and the sixth seal that's it my dear friend that's that sixth seal did so mysteriously let's just take we got ten more minutes let's just take a look i got about two to three pages well i got you're gonna see here i think it's about on that one i think i got about 15 pages that left i could get to oh there's so much on that mind you can just keep going from place to place but i'm afraid i'm confused you want to scatter too much rhythm and i'm not i can't hold it together like i should and isaiah let's take this isaiah the prophet seen this sixth seal open and spoke of it that's where it's important or not see well the whole the whole plan of redemption ladies are these seals the whole book now remember we've seen jesus saw it is that right see jesus saw it and now we find others that saw it we find it typed out in jacob we find it typed out in egypt we see it typed out at the cross now let's go back to isaiah i've got a whole lot more prophets showing down here too let's just i like this this of isaiah let's go back here to isaiah the 13th chapter of isaiah i like isaiah is a complete bible in itself you know do you know that see isaiah starts out with creation in the middle of the book he brings john at the end he brings a millennium and there's 66 books in the bible in 66 chapters in isaiah it's a complete uh encyclopedia itself notice 13th chapter now of of isaiah let's begin here at the sixth verse how ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty what's this sixth seal opening up here now come back here 713 years before christ come he's been 2000 years that'd be about seven about 2700 years ago isaiah seen this seal hanging there all right therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt what did jesus say and because iniquity should bound though the love of many shall wax and man's heart will be failing for fear see a roar see man's heart will faint and they shall be afraid pains of sorrow shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that trailer travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be ashamed no server here oh their face is a shame we got to get to that this man got a hole at me behold
