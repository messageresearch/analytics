[21:13] dogs that dogs there means men of
[21:15] unclean mind beware of evil workers
[21:17] Beware of the concision for we are the
[21:19] circumcision which worship God in the
[21:22] spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and
[21:24] have no confidence in the flesh though I
[21:26] might uh also have confidence in the
[21:29] flesh if any other man thinketh that he
[21:31] hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh
[21:33] I more circumcised The Eighth Day of the
[21:35] stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin
[21:37] a Hebrew of the Hebrews is touching the
[21:40] law of Pharisee concerning Zeal
[21:42] persecuting the church touching the
[21:43] righteousness which is which is in the
[21:46] law blameless but what things were gain
[21:48] to me those I counted lost for Christ
[21:51] yay doubtless I counted all things but
[21:53] the but loss for the Excellency of the
[21:55] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for
[21:58] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[21:59] things and to count them but dung that I
[22:01] may were in Christ and be found in him
[22:03] not having my own righteousness which is
[22:05] of the law but that which is through the
[22:08] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[22:10] is of god by faith that I may know him
[22:13] and the power of his resurrection and
[22:15] the fellowship of his sufferings being
[22:17] made conformable unto his death if by
[22:19] any means I might attain unto the
[22:21] resurrection of the Dead amen and we
[22:24] know if you keep reading in second
[22:26] Timothy Paul says I know there's a Crown
[22:28] of Life waiting for me amen so don't
[22:31] ever leave it hanging there where I

[23:42] May you grant it father and all the
[23:43] other hands that have been raised around
[23:45] the building those who are watching
[23:46] tonight Lord that that are well as well
[23:49] father we just want to commit them all
[23:50] into your hands may you meet every need
[23:52] according to your riches and glory and
[23:53] may you be exalted and worshiped in our
[23:55] lives because you deserve all the glory
[23:58] and praise we thank you Lord be with us
[24:00] now take over the meeting Lord have your
[24:01] way in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[24:05] bless you friends you can have your
[24:06] seats tonight so I want to take
[24:08] especially this you know I love it how
[24:10] the Apostle Paul says I just count all
[24:11] things but dung he could have boasted in
[24:13] all things but you know he he weighed it
[24:16] up knowing god or this natural life and
[24:18] he just threw the natural life away and
[24:20] walked with God Amen but you see this's
[24:22] this one verse that really jumped out to
[24:23] me uh this week that we are the
[24:26] circumcision which worship God in the
[24:28] spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and
[24:30] have no confidence in the flesh amen so
[24:33] we know that the circumcision that we uh
[24:36] Paul's really talking about is the true
[24:37] circumcision which is the baptism of the
[24:40] Holy Ghost which comes into our life and
[24:42] cuts the world out of our life that's
[24:43] the true circumcision it's not a
[24:45] physical one under the law but the true
[24:47] circumcision is of the heart amen as the
[24:50] Apostle Paul would say for in him
[24:52] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[24:53] bodily and ye are complete in him who is
[24:56] the head of all principality and power I
[24:58] like Colossians chapter 2 it's real I
[25:00] mean I know all the scriptures powerful
[25:02] but I think this is real powerful am
[25:04] mean in whom also you are circumcised
[25:06] with the circumcision made without hands
[25:08] and putting off the body of the sins of
[25:10] the flesh by the circumcision of Christ
[25:12] buried with him and baptism wherein also
[25:15] ye are risen with him through the faith
[25:17] of the operation of God who hath raised
[25:19] him from the dead and you being dead in
[25:21] your sins and uncircumcision of your
[25:24] flesh hath he quickened together with
[25:26] him having forgiven you
[25:28] all trespasses blotting out the
[25:31] handwriting of ordinances that was
[25:32] against us which was contrary to us and
[25:35] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[25:37] cross and having spoiled principalities
[25:39] and Powers he made a show of them openly
[25:42] triumphing over them in it amen so the
[25:45] Apostle Paul is saying that we were
[25:47] circumcised with a circumcision made
[25:49] without hands amen so it's not human
[25:51] doing that cuts away the world in
[25:52] unbelief and sin but it's the operation
[25:54] of the holy spirit of God Amen but the
[25:56] circumcision we know know it was a
[25:58] covenant that God made with Abraham and
[26:00] his seed and you know with the children
[26:02] of Israel we know it was a you know a
[26:04] covenant but the thing is we are under
[26:06] the true Covenant amen they were just
[26:08] under the blood of bulls and goats and
[26:09] God lived in their lives and God did
[26:11] many miraculous things but it didn't
[26:13] take sin nature out of them it was just
[26:15] the circumcision was just an outward uh
[26:18] display of a of a promise that God made
[26:21] but we know under the um under the law
[26:23] it was if you will I will you know but
[26:25] uh but the true Covenant which is the
[26:27] same like Abraham was given is I have
[26:29] made you am mean so God told Abraham
[26:31] I've made you the father of many nations
[26:33] it was a faith Covenant am mean and
[26:35] Abraham believed God and it was a
[26:36] tribute to him for righteousness and
[26:38] then God gave him the Seal of
[26:40] circumcision showing that God had
[26:42] received his faith now it's the same
[26:44] thing with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:46] God circumcises us or fills us with his
[26:49] holy spirit showing he has received your
[26:51] faith amen I trust this is not algebra
[26:54] this is very Mak sense right we have we
[26:55] have a true Covenant amen we are are we
[26:58] are the circumcision or you say we are
[27:00] the people of God am mean we are under
[27:02] his Covenant just like God said to
[27:04] Abraham I have made you a father of
[27:06] Nations yet he had no children he he and
[27:09] Sarah couldn't physically have a child
[27:11] but God said I have made you the father
[27:12] of Nations so it wasn't possible humanly
[27:15] for him to for them to have Isaac but
[27:17] God came on the scene changed their
[27:20] bodies made them young again gave them
[27:22] the ability and then they had the
[27:23] promised son and it shows that you know
[27:25] that humanly we cannot fulfill the word
[27:27] of God
[27:28] but God but but God giving us Faith amen
[27:31] and Grace to fulfill the word fulfills
[27:32] it in our lives so I think you know we
[27:35] can just rejoice in the Lord tonight
[27:37] amen you know if you're feeling done
[27:38] you're feeling feeling weary just
[27:40] rejoice in God trust in his ability let
[27:42] him let God be God as as brother impul
[27:45] said years ago just let God be God you
[27:47] be the believer and let God be God I
[27:49] think that's the right way to be because
[27:51] man takes things into their hands and
[27:53] they become God I don't want to become
[27:54] God no I'm going to let him be God God
[27:57] and I'm going to be the believer I'm
[27:59] going to let him do what he wants to do
[28:00] amen so so we are the circumcision which
[28:04] worship God in the spirit amen so it's
[28:06] so important as as the you know the Lord
[28:09] would say to the woman at the well that
[28:10] the father seeketh them who worship God
[28:12] in spirit and in truth amen so God was
[28:15] seeking you to worship him that way
[28:17] praise the Lord and he found us amen
[28:19] amen and rejoice in Christ Jesus and
[28:22] have no confidence in the flesh so I'm
[28:23] going to continue going down but you see
[28:26] the holy spirit is our c circumcision
[28:28] amen it's God's sharp knife amen it
[28:30] separates and cuts off the surplus of
[28:33] the Flesh of the world from us amen so
[28:36] if you are wrestling with something let
[28:38] God do an operation lay on his operating
[28:41] table amen take him at his word say God
[28:43] take this thing from me I don't want it
[28:45] no more you see the problem is people
[28:47] love sin because of sin nature we're
[28:49] born with you got to hate you got to
[28:51] hate sin for it to be taken from you
[28:53] amen it's like people you know you the
[28:54] devil the devil you know the Devil Makes
[28:57] people love their old life or love what
[28:59] they currently stuck in and because
[29:01] there's an a spiritual attachment to it
[29:03] of an emotion you can't get free but
[29:05] when you really see it for what it is
[29:07] and it takes God to really open our eyes
[29:09] you know if you went to Saul before he
[29:11] became Paul before the road to Damascus
[29:13] and you said you're a blind man oh boy
[29:16] you have no promise with God the blood
[29:18] of bulls and goats don't work anymore
[29:20] you're worshiping a false idea of a
[29:22] denomination you're just with Creeds and
[29:24] dogmas he would call you a crazy man oh
[29:27] yeah
[29:27] if if if you really said you're in sin
[29:30] Saul you're actually up to hear in
[29:31] religious sin you need Deliverance he
[29:33] would think you're a Madman wouldn't C
[29:35] you agree with me amen but you see but
[29:37] when God opened his eyes and he saw what
[29:39] it was really he saw phariseeism for
[29:41] what it was he counted it all but D he
[29:44] threw he gladly traded off you know
[29:46] gladly got rid of it and it's the same
[29:48] thing with you and I when God opens our
[29:50] eyes and we see sin for what it is we
[29:52] see religion for what it is am mean we
[29:54] see the things of the world for what
[29:56] they really are we say Lord take it from
[29:58] me as fast as you can I I want no part
[30:00] in it amen I'm glad I got some amens
[30:02] tonight amen you see you see but it
[30:04] takes the Lord to open our eyes that's
[30:06] why it's so important to have an
[30:08] atmosphere of Faith amen amen have a
[30:10] loving atmosphere love the Lord with all
[30:12] your heart let him come on the scene let
[30:14] him change your thinking I mean because
[30:16] humanly you know we could have a
[30:18] testimony meeting right now and every
[30:20] testimony that comes we get and you'd
[30:22] say I don't know how I was going to get
[30:24] out of this who's had those kind of
[30:26] situations you're like I don't know how
[30:27] are you going to come on the scene it's
[30:29] human reasoning there trying to grip a
[30:32] person but then you say Lord I commit it
[30:33] to you and somehow God comes changes
[30:36] your thinking reveals the promise of his
[30:38] word to you and and and he gets you out
[30:40] of it you don't necessarily know how he
[30:41] did it but he did it right amen so Lord
[30:45] praise the Lord amen so it was a sign to
[30:47] Abraham I was going to read this now
[30:48] Abraham the promises made to Abraham has
[30:50] seed after him now God gave this promise
[30:53] to Abraham and his seed would possess
[30:55] the gates of his enemy after he had
[30:57] tried tried Abraham tested Abraham now
[30:58] after testing come then Abraham had
[31:01] already been converted we'd call it from
[31:03] paganism into God and then God had give
[31:06] him as a sign of the Holy Ghost the
[31:07] circumcision then after the circumcision
[31:10] then came the testing time a pretty a
[31:13] very pretty type here of the church then
[31:14] after we have got saved then we are um
[31:18] then we are give the Seal of the
[31:20] promised circumcision which is not of
[31:22] the flesh but of the spirit and the Holy
[31:24] Spirit is our circumcision it's God's
[31:26] sharp knife separates us and cuts off
[31:29] the surplus of the Flesh of the world
[31:30] from us the word of God sharper than a
[31:33] two-edged sword so you see come right
[31:35] back in the word of God is a thing that
[31:37] the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit uses not
[31:39] Creeds not denominations but the word is
[31:41] what separates us from the things of the
[31:43] world it cuts away our ideas and things
[31:45] yeah am mean and holy consecrates us to
[31:48] God and Jesus said if you abide in me
[31:50] and my word in you there you are then it
[31:52] isn't your word it's his word then you
[31:54] see if you abide in me and my word in
[31:56] you you could could ask what you will
[31:58] uh-huh see what is it it's not you it's
[32:01] you're not speaking your own word you're
[32:03] speaking his
[32:05] word amen now we know we're in a battle
[32:09] okay we're just going to go for a
[32:10] journey tonight okay we're in a battle
[32:12] let's have a let have a midweek boost go
[32:14] home praising God okay but you know
[32:16] we're in a battle okay David would come
[32:19] to know that his God is his Rock and his
[32:23] Fortress and his deliverer this wasn't
[32:25] just something he pinned while sitting
[32:27] in Jerusalem with his feet up on a couch
[32:28] he really experienced God being his
[32:30] deliverer he went through some real
[32:32] tight spaces he had some real difficult
[32:34] times you know of of when maybe he
[32:37] thought this was going to be his last
[32:38] moment upon the Earth but remember if I
[32:40] put it in uh the Apostle Paul's words
[32:43] there from Philippians but he he he was
[32:45] of the circumcision he had a covenant
[32:47] God made a covenant with him I mean just
[32:49] like God has made a covenant with you
[32:51] and I so David was given a covenant by
[32:54] God by the anointing of a Vindicated
[32:56] Prophet that he was going to be king of
[32:57] Israel right so he realized that God was
[33:00] going to get him to the throne when how
[33:02] what age don't know he didn't know but
[33:04] God he had complete confidence that God
[33:07] was going to get him there now he came
[33:10] to a spot in his life when he Sor I'm
[33:12] just trying to find that scripture again
[33:13] where the Lord where he realized because
[33:17] of experience that the Lord was his Rock
[33:20] and his Fortress and his deliverer am
[33:22] mean the god of my rock in him will I
[33:23] trust he is my shield and the Horn of my
[33:26] salvation my high tower and my refuge My
[33:28] Savior thou saveth me from violence I'll
[33:31] call on the Lord who is worthy to be
[33:32] praised so shall I be saved from my
[33:35] enemies amen so good you can keep
[33:36] reading the whole chapter it's very
[33:37] powerful I don't have it all there but
[33:39] you see now we have we have a shelter
[33:41] today now where I really got all this
[33:44] from as I was talking I was talking with
[33:46] Christine and we're talking about people
[33:48] people sayings and people you know and
[33:51] you know I've experienced this too you
[33:53] have a wonderful time in the Lord then
[33:54] you expect the devil to come and attack
[33:55] you
[33:57] but we're not playing a game of punch
[33:59] for punch with the devil have you ever
[34:00] seen that I'm sure you Brothers may be
[34:01] seen it on YouTube you two guys will
[34:03] stand there and they'll slap each other
[34:04] off you know they'll they'll have a turn
[34:07] one guy will slap him then he'll take
[34:09] the blow of the other guy what a stupid
[34:11] thing to do okay it's foolishness but I
[34:16] don't want to sting you but it's pretty
[34:17] foolish to do the same thing with the
[34:18] devil am mean to to you have a glorious
[34:21] time breakthrough and prayer wonderful
[34:23] time in the word you have a great time
[34:24] in church or camp or something and then
[34:27] well I guess I'm going to have a trial
[34:28] now and you know the devil's going to
[34:29] come at me yeah sure he probably will
[34:31] but do you have to take it see shamgar
[34:34] came to a point in his life realized I
[34:35] don't have to take the devil's slaps no
[34:37] more I don't have to put up with him
[34:39] coming season after season Harvest after
[34:41] harvest taking all my blessings away he
[34:43] realized this is not how this works I
[34:45] mean humanly you know before the Lord
[34:47] opened his eyes to it he realized well
[34:49] this is how it works you know humanly
[34:50] but then he realized no I'm a
[34:52] circumcised son of Abraham living in my
[34:55] inheritance I have every right to enjoy
[34:57] the blessings of God I have every right
[35:00] to enjoy the Harvest God has given me I
[35:02] have it's a god-given right God gave me
[35:04] the ground God gave me the ground God
[35:06] gave me the word amen he's given me
[35:08] Bountiful blessings to you a mountain of
[35:10] bread to enjoy Amen to to sustain me
[35:13] spiritually so he realized no I'm not
[35:15] going to take the devil's slaps no more
[35:17] but I'm going to kill this I'm going to
[35:18] kill these Philistines you know maybe
[35:20] the Philistines knew him on first name
[35:22] basis maybe he knew them on first name
[35:24] basis like some of us will know you know
[35:26] guilt and shame and resentment and anger
[35:28] and you know unforgiveness and buness
[35:30] and all these things we can know these
[35:31] Devils on first a basis but there's got
[35:33] to come a time in your life where you
[35:35] realize I don't have to take his blows
[35:36] no more amen but I can down everyone
[35:39] that comes against me I can it's been
[35:41] placed in your power to break the cycle
[35:44] of the devil amen because remember
[35:45] Shamar God wasn't going to come down
[35:49] without Shamar first stepping on the
[35:50] word of God stepping on his god-given
[35:52] promise remember you let the word of God
[35:54] put it put the word first yeah take him
[35:57] at his word first and then watch God
[35:59] come down and anoint that word in your
[36:01] life amen so he realized this game of
[36:04] slapping is going to end amen that's it
[36:06] come on what happened next season they
[36:09] didn't come back they were dead amen it
[36:12] was one big saw 600 men that's quite a
[36:15] battle against one but hey Shamar was
[36:17] the majority CU he was a what a child of
[36:19] the circumcision God made a covenant
[36:22] with him you're a son of Abraham I
[36:24] placed you in your Promised Land your
[36:25] forbears did not bring themselves here I
[36:28] brought them here I mean I birthed you
[36:30] into this land and this is where you
[36:31] belong and it's the same thing with you
[36:33] and I friends I trust you realize God's
[36:35] made a covenant with you that you'd be
[36:37] the head and not the tail amen you
[36:39] wouldn't be the devil's Whipping Boy am
[36:41] mean you wouldn't be his his his Target
[36:43] board or whatever you want to call it no
[36:45] you are the head and he is the tail am
[36:47] mean God has given you Authority by his
[36:49] word am mean to stand on the neck of the
[36:51] enemy amen this is what we have so so
[36:54] you know we shouldn't have the slap for
[36:56] a slap game with the devil amen amen we
[36:59] don't have to put up with his nonsense
[37:01] amen he comes he comes into your life
[37:04] comes into your children's life you just
[37:06] let it happen you shouldn't you plead
[37:09] the blood amen plead the blood say Lord
[37:11] you made a covenant with me that day on
[37:13] Calvary Lord I plead your blood amen
[37:15] your blood is the greatest barrier there
[37:17] can ever be amen it's the strength it's
[37:19] our it's our it's our defense amen you
[37:22] can plead the blood and you because God
[37:24] is waiting for you amen he does hasn't
[37:26] made you a robot right right he's put
[37:29] you on free moral agency and I think I'm
[37:32] just going to use my free moral agency
[37:34] to speak the word of God in faith
[37:35] believing he will fulfill it I me
[37:38] believing my God can come on the scene
[37:40] and can rearrange the whole picture I
[37:42] mean that I don't have to put up with
[37:43] the devil and go through how many people
[37:45] here have been a virus or sickness has
[37:48] come into your body you asked for prayer
[37:49] or pray you've been healed amen that is
[37:52] a perfect example of God interrupting
[37:55] the devil's plan amen because normally
[37:57] sickness it's got to work out a certain
[37:59] length of time based on your immune
[38:01] system and age and how bad it is sure
[38:03] but there's a time scale right that it
[38:05] has to work through but then what did
[38:06] you do you took God at his word you took
[38:09] God at his word you asked in faith you
[38:11] got prayer you believed however anointed
[38:13] of the world maybe you prayed yourself
[38:14] soone prayed for you and God interrupted
[38:17] the devil's plan
[38:19] am Hallelujah but what did you do you
[38:22] took God at his word amen you take that
[38:25] example for everything the Devil comes
[38:27] into your life amen he comes in a mind
[38:29] battle do you just let it go on a
[38:30] hamster wheel and let the volume turn up
[38:32] and turn up or do you say no Satan amen
[38:36] business hours are closed call someone
[38:39] else use someone else as a trash can
[38:41] don't don't use my mind I'm not no I'm
[38:43] not here for you devil my mind see sure
[38:46] the prophet said this is no man's land
[38:49] but if you look at World War I no man's
[38:51] land became occupied land hallelujah
[38:54] amen it was it may have been no man's
[38:56] land for a lot of time but eventually
[38:58] you know the Western Powers they drove
[39:00] the uh Germans and that whatever austral
[39:03] Hungary whoever it became occupied right
[39:07] so sometimes this can be no man's land a
[39:09] lot but there but there's got to come a
[39:10] time when it's God's land it's
[39:13] Emmanuel's ground amen where it's
[39:15] fortified by the Holy Ghost it's
[39:17] fortified by God's word where the things
[39:19] that once bother you don't bother you no
[39:21] more he say but they're being still
[39:23] bothering me hey World War I came to an
[39:25] end yeah are they still there in their
[39:28] trenches no right it's done right World
[39:32] War II done this Ukraine war it'll come
[39:35] to an end eventually somehow well the
[39:37] Millennium is going to be a thousand
[39:38] years of Peace A War's going to come to
[39:40] an end I'm not trying to be silly but I
[39:42] just want you to realize every war comes
[39:44] to an end it's not a Perpetual thing
[39:47] even this war between God and
[39:49] Satan Satan goes into the Lake of Fire
[39:52] we keep dancing around the throne
[39:53] eternally Hallelujah and he's not even
[39:55] an afterthought we just rejoice in the
[39:57] god of our Salvation so that war will
[39:59] come to an end amen this war against
[40:01] this flesh will come to an end when
[40:02] these bodies are changed amen so every
[40:05] war comes to an end amen so don't think
[40:07] you got to put up with the devil forever
[40:09] because no I read the end of the book
[40:11] there's a time when he's gone amen right
[40:13] so why not let the word of God take
[40:15] preeminence and let God take over that
[40:19] battle amen I think that's what we going
[40:22] to do amen because we have a safety zone
[40:25] and that SA zone is not a bomb shelter
[40:29] praise God Amen our protection is made
[40:31] out of feathers it's not reinforced
[40:34] concrete it's not steel plating it's not
[40:36] something like that with electronic
[40:38] warfare and anti- drone stuff no it's
[40:40] made out of feathers amen but it's the
[40:43] shadow of the almighty under his
[40:45] feathers is where we've come to find a
[40:47] place of Refuge amen it's far stronger
[40:49] than any any anything the devil can the
[40:52] devil can't blow it to Pieces that's
[40:54] right amen who's who who come under the
[40:56] shadow of his wings who's come to trust
[40:59] under the shadow of his wings amen trust
[41:01] is built because a relationship has
[41:03] developed amen so I trust that you have
[41:06] you have come to trust to hide under the
[41:08] shadow of his wings amen when Trouble
[41:10] Comes your way you're not trying to work
[41:11] it out yourself what do you do you go
[41:13] under the Shad of his wings under his
[41:14] word say Lord help me in this time of
[41:16] trouble guide me through these decisions
[41:19] during this time of insecurity show me
[41:20] my identity Lord what are you doing
[41:22] you're coming under the shadow of his
[41:23] wings praise the Lord that's the best
[41:25] place to be amen it's our safety zone
[41:29] Hallelujah see this is why we've got to
[41:31] trust him
[41:32] see amen see brother B says this and we
[41:36] feel like we're going through a great
[41:38] time of distress and trials perplexity

[43:37] whole armor of God Amen that you may be
[43:40] able to withstand in the evil day this
[43:43] is the evil day the Apostle Paul sure

[43:47] but he's Al especially speaking about it
[43:49] in the evil day which is today you got
[43:51] to put on the whole armor of God now we
[43:54] know that the whole armor of God is the
[43:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost our arm is on

[44:00] of prayers I put on the helmet of Faith
[44:03] salvation and different no no it's the
[44:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but we've

[45:18] and I say thank you Lord amen it's not
[45:21] the spot that makes it special it's the
[45:22] promise that makes it special but it's
[45:24] nice to go you know go back to these
[45:26] places and remember those things and the
[45:29] best place to go is not a stairs but go
[45:31] into the word amen and look at the
[45:33] promises God has given you am mean if
[45:35] God has quickened any promise to your
[45:37] life amen go and read it again go listen
[45:40] to it again it will encourage you it
[45:41] will strengthen you'll stabilize your
[45:43] walk because you begin to realize the
[45:45] one who called you is not going to lose
[45:47] you amen the one who the one who saved
[45:49] you from death and sorrow is going to
[45:51] preserve you and keep you amen but he
[45:53] says you've got to you got to pick up
[45:55] the shield take the shield of Faith
[45:57] don't take the devil's blows you don't
[45:59] need to that's why we got armor amen we
[46:02] don't have to put up with this nonsense
[46:04] you can you have authority Amen to deal
[46:07] with him amen you say well we're going
[46:09] to he's going to be punching at us every
[46:11] day yeah but you can bypass them punches
[46:14] and you can punch him back why just why
[46:16] just give them a tap on the chin and say
[46:17] do you like that no knock them out amen
[46:20] don't let them get back up see sometimes
[46:23] people just get a little bit of a
[46:24] blessing they think now the devil's down
[46:25] no no no press all the way in press all
[46:28] the way in and and when he's knocked on
[46:30] the ground stomp on him a little bit
[46:33] brother Ram said when he had the vision
[46:34] of the mumber he bound it in the name of
[46:36] Jesus Christ it turned into glass the
[46:37] life went out he said I mashed on it a
[46:39] little bit that's right amen so that's
[46:41] what we should do with the devil how do
[46:42] you masch on the devil give God praise
[46:44] amen really the Thunder that shakes the
[46:47] kingdom of hell is a Sanctified sold out
[46:49] life full of the love of God that's what
[46:51] shakes the kingdom of Hell amen so we
[46:53] shouldn't get up and say oh I hate you
[46:54] devil I no no just love the Lord am just
[46:57] Praise Him amen but we we have been
[46:59] given the armor to quench all the fiery
[47:01] darts of the
[47:03] wicked amen praise the Lord he was good
[47:07] with the sword speaking of Peter that
[47:09] but but he could Jewel the Creed just as
[47:11] good as anyone could that was in the
[47:12] garden but he when it come to spiritual
[47:14] courage he didn't have it so he failed
[47:16] right there now why he only knowed one
[47:19] thing as Creed but brother after he went
[47:20] up to Pentecost he put on the whole
[47:22] armor of God now watch him he's a
[47:24] different person now he put on the whole
[47:26] armor what was it that word that he had
[47:28] walked with was in him burning him up
[47:31] with fire in his flesh and soul he had
[47:33] the whole armor of God on that's God's
[47:35] provided armor he had the baptism filled
[47:37] with the Holy Ghost what is it God makes
[47:40] himself ever presentent in his own Army
[47:42] God on the day of Pentecost sent down
[47:44] the full armor of God for his army that
[47:47] was himself among you amen I mean so if
[47:50] God has filled you with the Holy Ghost
[47:52] your experience can be different we all
[47:54] have a different testimony but if he's
[47:55] turned your heart to have genuine faith
[47:57] in the word and you see it living in
[47:58] your life he all you want is him you got
[48:01] the whole armor of God if you had the if
[48:03] you got the true Bap baptism of the Holy
[48:05] Ghost because you got to realize now
[48:07] where it says that they rejoice in
[48:08] Christ Jesus now we know Jesus Christ is
[48:11] his word right more than just a nice
[48:14] picture of a uh forgive me if this
[48:16] sounds wrong but it's more than just
[48:18] getting emotionally caught up in a
[48:20] picture of a man dying on a cross that's
[48:22] right because because many people get
[48:23] very emotional they see The Passion of
[48:25] the Christ they cry Rivers right but
[48:27] then when it comes to surrendering
[48:29] themselves to the word they won't do it
[48:30] that's right so they have a emotional
[48:32] idea of a of a man but they won't submit
[48:34] themselves to the word of God and that's
[48:36] Paramount because Jesus is his word and
[48:39] that's why the True Believer rejoices in
[48:41] the word I mean they put their exper
[48:44] they put their present State way on the
[48:45] back burner and they take God at his
[48:47] word above all things and they let that
[48:49] word change them amen why because they
[48:51] love him but you see we've got to put
[48:54] the word first amen now Joshua would
[48:57] tell the children of Israel that are
[48:58] just about to cross Jordan and and he
[49:01] instructs the ark to go before them and
[49:04] he says yet there shall be a space
[49:06] between you and it that's the Ark of the
[49:07] Covenant about 2,000 cubits by measure
[49:10] come not near unto it that ye may know
[49:12] the way which ye must go for ye have not
[49:15] passed this way here to for they walking
[49:18] in a new season they had been 40 years
[49:20] in the wilderness they had gone round
[49:21] the mountain and round the mountain and
[49:23] had the same old experiences but this
[49:25] was a new season where they were going
[49:27] to cross into their inheritances amen
[49:29] where where the whole purpose of Moses
[49:32] coming to deliver them out of Egypt was
[49:34] going to be fulfilled but so he's saying
[49:36] we haven't passed this way before this
[49:37] is a new
[49:39] walk amen we're walking into our land of
[49:42] promise sure our forefathers Abraham
[49:44] Isaac and Jacob they lived in this land
[49:46] but we've never been in this land we've
[49:48] never dwelt in this land sure Joshua and
[49:50] Caleb they went in there as spies to
[49:52] spied out but now they were going to go
[49:53] dwell in it and so Joshua was
[49:55] instructing them keep the word before
[49:57] you because we've never gone this way
[49:59] before and I'll say it's the same thing
[50:00] in this day there's never been a time
[50:03] when a body of people around the earth
[50:04] have walked from this world to the next
[50:06] world there's never been a mass Rapture
[50:08] like there's going to be in this season
[50:10] and me this world's going to a Great
[50:11] Tribulation the world has never gone
[50:13] into a Great Tribulation before it's
[50:15] going to be burnt with fire and armag
[50:16] again and all different things this has
[50:18] never happened before I mean it's never
[50:20] been a day like this day where all these
[50:22] millions of demons been released out of
[50:24] the bottomless pit like has happened in
[50:26] this day this is a different season
[50:28] that's why it's so important keep the
[50:29] word before you let the word go first
[50:32] Amen to put the word before your
[50:34] thoughts whatever you do amen put it
[50:37] before your worries amen you say I'm
[50:40] scared what's going to happen in the
[50:41] future well I know between well I don't
[50:44] know what's going to happen between here
[50:45] and Glory but we're going to glory amen
[50:47] amen but so but put the word before your
[50:50] worries am mean take the word above your
[50:51] worries cuz worry has helped no one
[50:55] faith has delivered faith has brought
[50:57] Resurrection faith has brought healing
[50:58] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[51:00] the promises of God but worry has not
[51:02] done anything amen put the word before
[51:05] your imaginations this is a world where
[51:07] people have caught up in the imagination
[51:09] of their mind where the world has built
[51:11] aot people are living in lives of
[51:13] different entertainments and gaming and
[51:16] music and movies and things fantasy
[51:18] world has it ever been a day in the
[51:20] history of man where people you know it
[51:23] used to be when I was a kid people who
[51:25] loved that kind of stuff they were nerds
[51:26] and made fun of now everyone's a
[51:30] nerd but they live in this fantasy world
[51:33] they make cosplay and they're dressed
[51:34] like their favorite Heroes and all these
[51:36] things and you know why why put on a
[51:39] fantasy Persona when you can put on the
[51:41] whole armor of God and know God in his
[51:44] reality amen people love superheroes I
[51:47] tell you if you're a man or woman of
[51:48] Faith you are a hero am mean you're a
[51:50] hero of Faith you do things the world
[51:52] knows nothing about amen so why why get
[51:55] caught up in those things and we can be
[51:57] caught up with the promises of God so
[51:59] put the word before your imaginations
[52:00] put it before your fears put God first
[52:03] and everything and you'll be successful
[52:05] in spite of all the devil can try and do
[52:07] to you that's what brother Braham said
[52:09] amen so the so as soon as the priests
[52:11] put their feet in the Jordan and begin
[52:13] toart and they crossed over and it's so
[52:15] important that we keep the word before
[52:17] us we never we never forget the word
[52:20] amen we let him always lead us praise
[52:22] the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen
[52:25] because if he put the word first you'll
[52:26] have a Victory Day am mean notice now
[52:29] this and this when Joshua took the word
[52:31] first and put the word first he crossed
[52:33] God had told him I as I was with Moses
[52:35] so I'll be with you I'll not fail you
[52:37] I'll be with you no man is going to
[52:39] stand before you all the days of your
[52:41] life I'm going to be right there don't
[52:43] fear what's going to take place I'll be
[52:45] right there then what with a commission
[52:47] like that what could Joshua do but put
[52:49] the word first amen there you are with a
[52:51] commission from God put the word first
[52:53] and it brought a vday
[52:55] or a Victory Day have we not been
[52:57] commissioned to be the final voice to
[53:00] the final age amen a living voice for
[53:02] the word is put on flesh amen you are a
[53:05] lived voice amen your your life should
[53:07] be preaching wherever you go your life
[53:10] your conduct how you dress the how the
[53:12] way you act people that's a sermon I
[53:14] don't know if you realize it but you're
[53:15] preaching from from when you're awake to
[53:17] when you're asleep to when you're awake
[53:19] your life is preaching a sermon amen
[53:22] amen why it's the life it's it's the
[53:24] word on display amen but has he not
[53:26] commissioned us to take the word and
[53:28] preach it to Every Creature this
[53:31] gospel amen these signs shall follow
[53:33] them that believe the last Commission of
[53:34] the church has he not commissioned us to
[53:36] do it amen so if we've been given this
[53:39] commission which we have we put the word
[53:41] first it'll bring a victory day that's
[53:43] right Hallelujah it won't bring an
[53:45] Armistice Day or a day of peace or I
[53:48] mean I mean a Day of Defeat or you know
[53:50] signing surrender documents and
[53:52] capitulation no it'll bring a victory
[53:54] day and and we know in great Wars
[53:56] there's times where it seems like the
[53:57] one who eventually wins is going to lose
[53:59] but it's those who really stand firm and
[54:02] say no I see victory in sight we won't
[54:04] surrender we won't back up we will have
[54:06] the victory I mean you just listen to
[54:08] Winston Churchill sometime where he said
[54:10] a famous speech in in in the midst of
[54:13] World War II he just said never give up
[54:15] amen never give up never give up never
[54:19] give up that was a speech amen
[54:22] hallelujah a man of a incredible
[54:24] vocabulary D's speech he didn't say it
[54:26] just to fill in time he meant it with
[54:27] everything within him he embodied the
[54:29] British resistance of Hitler and the
[54:31] axis forces the thing is he released
[54:33] those kind of sentiments and what
[54:35] happened they were they had a vday amen
[54:38] amen in times when it looked like they
[54:40] were totally defeated that were going to
[54:41] lose the Nazis just needed to cross the
[54:43] channel and it was going to be all over
[54:45] they stood firm now how much more when
[54:46] it seems like All Is Lost and you don't
[54:48] know how God's ever going to come on the
[54:50] scene who's ever been in that
[54:52] way but yet you say no I'm going to have
[54:54] vict ictory cuz God has given me a
[54:56] promise and I'm not looking at what I
[54:58] see right now I'm looking to the end I'm
[55:00] looking to his promise Above All Things
[55:02] amen then you'll have a victory day you
[55:04] put the word first amen if if the word
[55:06] says you're more than a conqueror I'd
[55:09] put that first amen if God yeah if the
[55:11] word says I can do all things through
[55:13] Christ Jesus it strengthens me he's my
[55:15] strength amen if it says that he's my
[55:17] sustainer my healer my keeper My
[55:19] Redeemer my Fortress amen he's my way
[55:21] maker my shepherd my
[55:23] protector amen amen you put that first
[55:26] don't put your Humanity first put the
[55:28] word first amen amen let God be God Amen
[55:32] Mary had to believe for the
[55:33] impossibilities but God takes the
[55:35] impossibilities and makes them real when
[55:37] he's took it his word I mean the doctor
[55:40] M said you'll never be rid of that
[55:41] cancer the doctor might have said you'll
[55:42] never be able to walk again well it's
[55:44] impossible for you to do it but
[55:46] impossibilities Fade Out when God took
[55:48] it his word no matter what the doctor
[55:50] says he's doing the best he can but God
[55:53] is God Amen and his word is just like he
[55:55] is oh yes amen we think God is this
[55:59] Majestic all powerful allmighty Supreme
[56:02] one his word is as he is cuz he is his
[56:05] word amen and you take his word that
[56:07] settles it forever if thou canest
[56:09] believe and say to this mountain be
[56:11] moved and don't doubt in your heart it
[56:13] will uh but will believe that what
[56:16] you've said will come to pass you can
[56:18] have what you've said God took at his
[56:20] word I love that message Jehovah of
[56:22] Miracles he's still the same one today
[56:24] amen we know that he is his word amen
[56:26] the beginning was the word the word was
[56:28] with God and the Word was God Amen his
[56:31] word pardon me is the most important
[56:34] thing amen God never places signs ahead
[56:37] of his word they were added for proof of
[56:40] the word but the word is first to prove
[56:42] it Elijah said to the woman bake me a
[56:44] cake first then watch the miracle happen
[56:46] come to the word first and then watch
[56:48] the miracle the seed word itself is what
[56:50] the Holy Ghost energizes so if you want
[56:53] the Holy Ghost to energize your faith
[56:54] take God at his word receive his word in
[56:57] faith and say Lord I believe it I don't
[56:58] know how you're going to do it but
[56:59] you're going to do it see he's the one
[57:01] who fulfills his word am you just got to
[57:03] have a believing heart say Lord I take
[57:05] hurt your word then what happens then
[57:06] God will energize the Holy Spirit Will
[57:08] energize that word and cause it to come
[57:10] to
[57:11] pass listen everyone had Faith to come
[57:14] to church tonight and even those who are
[57:16] streaming they believe right that's why
[57:19] you're here that's that faith is enough
[57:22] for the promises of God to be fulfilled
[57:24] cuz I feel sometimes people look at me
[57:26] like there's no way I could ever SE God
[57:27] fulfill things in their life because I
[57:29] don't have no faith that's the devil
[57:30] talking to you you say I don't have no
[57:32] faith you say God help my unbelief I
[57:34] believe just like the man with the son
[57:36] with the eptic spirit right but if we
[57:38] have enough Faith to come to church we
[57:40] have no faith to believe the Bible and
[57:41] pray don't you think God can do the rest
[57:43] of it amen if we take God at his word
[57:46] yes sir amen because because we must
[57:49] understand that our five senses are not
[57:52] made to contact god brother R said the
[57:55] five senses are not made to contact God
[57:57] but faith is made to contact God prise
[58:00] the Lord amen so we must not let our
[58:03] senses rule us I remember when Christine
[58:06] and I were in um in um what do you call
[58:09] it Christ Church there in the first
[58:11] earthquake place was shaking violently
[58:13] up and down we were praying by our front
[58:15] door and I wanted to keep my eyes open
[58:18] and look around what's happening but I
[58:19] said no I'm going to pray see I could
[58:21] have let My Five Senses rule but no
[58:24] watching the play Shake isn't going to
[58:26] help me that's right amen asking the
[58:29] Lord to help us is really the only thing
[58:31] because that that place could have
[58:32] fallen over if it wanted whatever but
[58:34] what watching your building disintegrate
[58:36] will that help you no but praying asking
[58:39] the Lord to help you helps you rightall
[58:41] so I'm saying is My Five Senses wanted
[58:43] to keep my eyes open and look what's
[58:44] going on I said no I'm going to close my
[58:45] eyes and pray and God came down we had a
[58:47] glorious time didn't we we a wonderful
[58:49] prayer meeting amen so many times our
[58:52] five senses want to rule us but let's
[58:53] let Faith rule us us let's Let God In
[58:57] Action amen let him come on the scene
[58:59] because we contact God by faith The
[59:01] Sixth Sense amen these five senses
[59:04] control this body but the six sense is
[59:08] Faith hallelujah amen so you see the
[59:12] thing is if we realize if I can just see
[59:16] the Apostle Paul said that we are the
[59:19] circumcision which worship God in the
[59:21] spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and
[59:24] have no confidence in the
[59:26] flesh amen and if there's ever been a
[59:29] day where we can worship God in the
[59:31] spirit is today am mean if there's ever
[59:33] been a day we can rejoice in Christ
[59:35] Jesus the word is today amen when when
[59:39] when um John saw the book open by being
[59:42] taken by the lamb and opened they said
[59:44] everything in heaven and the Earth under
[59:45] the Earth heard and rejoice am mean if
[59:47] we can if we you know if there's a
[59:49] people that can Rejoice it's us and if
[59:52] there's a people that can have no conf
[59:54] confidence in the flesh but full
[59:56] confidence in God it is US amen we can
[59:59] look at every Miracle every testimony
[1:00:01] every time God has come on the scene and
[1:00:03] we can now have full confidence in God
[1:00:06] because of everything he's done and when
[1:00:08] you think about it we're not like Gideon
[1:00:10] threshing wheat in secret saying where's
[1:00:12] where's the god of Miracles if God be
[1:00:14] with us where are his miracles see we're
[1:00:16] not in that condition we actually know
[1:00:18] God is with us and we see his miracles I
[1:00:21] mean we see his Supernatural power move
[1:00:23] am mean so we can
[1:00:25] have full confidence in God because if
[1:00:28] you think about it we don't worship
[1:00:30] man's ideas we haven't gone to a Bible
[1:00:33] school and they've got a academic board
[1:00:34] and saying this is the word and this is
[1:00:36] how it should be we don't have that we
[1:00:38] have thus sayith the Lord that's been
[1:00:40] supernaturally Vindicated amen so so we
[1:00:43] can have full confidence in the Lord and
[1:00:46] have no confidence in the
[1:00:49] flesh praise the Lord but you see the
[1:00:51] devil and and I'm just going to wind up
[1:00:53] with this but you see the devil want
[1:00:54] wants us to have confidence in the flesh
[1:00:56] see this this age we live in is very
[1:00:59] much the me I what I can do kind of an
[1:01:01] age but there's a people in the land who
[1:01:04] have no confidence in the flesh they
[1:01:05] realize like Jesus said I'm the vine and
[1:01:07] you're the branches amen so so those who
[1:01:10] are the branches bear the fruit but it's
[1:01:12] the life and the vine comes into you and
[1:01:14] produces the fruit where Jesus said uh
[1:01:17] without me you can do nothing we realize
[1:01:20] that yes praise God but with him we can
[1:01:22] do all things but we have no confidence
[1:01:24] in our own ability but you
[1:01:27] see I wanted to do this ages ago and
[1:01:29] maybe I'll take a sermon and do it later
[1:01:31] but you know you take the four uh first
[1:01:33] four seals you can actually make it
[1:01:34] personal how the Devil comes in to bring
[1:01:36] death into someone's life but you see
[1:01:38] the third seal the third seal here it
[1:01:42] says I heard the third Beast say come
[1:01:44] and see him and I beheld in L Black
[1:01:46] Horse and he had that sat on him appear
[1:01:48] of balances in his hand and I Heard a
[1:01:50] Voice in the midst of the fourbe say a
[1:01:52] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[1:01:54] measures of a barley for a penny and see
[1:01:55] thou hurt not the oil and the wine now
[1:01:59] in this here sorry I don't have it on
[1:02:00] the slides but you see what this is is
[1:02:02] this is when during the time of Martin
[1:02:04] Lutheran before that the church was
[1:02:06] charging money for prayer charging money
[1:02:08] for salvation charging for the things of
[1:02:11] life so what is it now man with trust in
[1:02:14] their own ability I can make the money I
[1:02:16] can get my now we don't believe in
[1:02:18] purgatory but they did but you know I if
[1:02:21] I give enough money I can actually
[1:02:22] prepay for sin yeah
[1:02:24] this is what they believed in you you
[1:02:26] give a certain amount of money I can rob
[1:02:28] that guy I can kill that person but I've
[1:02:29] already paid for the sin with my money
[1:02:31] therefore it's okay so what is that it's
[1:02:33] come into the it came into the church
[1:02:35] it's man's ability gets them favor with
[1:02:38] God right because if you have the money
[1:02:40] then you get favor with God and he'll
[1:02:42] forgive you of the sin and that comes
[1:02:44] right down into this day when man gets
[1:02:46] in his mind it's my ability makes me
[1:02:49] earn favor with God right amen this is
[1:02:53] true isn't it you see people who
[1:02:54] legalistic you know way out of balance
[1:02:57] in the word and everything they think of
[1:02:58] their extra what they call Holy with by
[1:03:01] human effort what they have gained favor
[1:03:03] with God and God's going to bless them
[1:03:06] this is this horse rider riding it comes
[1:03:09] right down into this age amen but you
[1:03:12] see there was a voice from the throne
[1:03:13] saying touch ye not the oil and the wine
[1:03:17] amen so there's a people in the land who
[1:03:19] are not depending on their human ability
[1:03:21] they have no confidence in the flesh
[1:03:24] amen that's what we read in Philippians
[1:03:25] was it not am me so there's a people
[1:03:27] that have no confidence in the flesh but
[1:03:28] they have full confidence in God I me
[1:03:31] it's where it says the voice from the
[1:03:32] midst of the four beasts that's a voice
[1:03:34] from the Throne of God saying do not
[1:03:36] touch the oil and the wine amen so Satan
[1:03:39] you can't you can't hinder the the oil
[1:03:41] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:43] and the wine is a stimulation by
[1:03:45] Revelation am amen so there's a people
[1:03:47] in the land amen who are rejoicing in
[1:03:50] the anointing amen of the word and
[1:03:52] they're stimulated by the revelation of
[1:03:54] it what does that mean that we now
[1:03:56] rejoice in Christ Jesus am mean if
[1:03:58] there's ever been a people on the Earth
[1:04:00] that are drunk with the spirit I believe
[1:04:01] it is this age I mean why because it's
[1:04:04] not just a little drink and a little
[1:04:05] Tipple here and there and a tasting no
[1:04:07] the whole wine press of God is open the
[1:04:10] whole Winery is open have you H to say
[1:04:12] it we can get drunk brother and say man
[1:04:14] can be so drunk on the Holy Ghost every
[1:04:16] day of his life until he leaves this
[1:04:18] world Hallelujah we can be this way amen
[1:04:22] we're actually who's it well
[1:04:24] I'm sure you've seen a drunk person
[1:04:26] who's seen a happy drunk before I've
[1:04:28] been a happy drunk before their life can
[1:04:31] be absolute misery but they're
[1:04:33] happy why because intoxication makes
[1:04:37] them be
[1:04:38] desensitized by what's G on now being
[1:04:41] drunk on the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:04:43] desensitize you to what's going on it
[1:04:46] actually brings your life into
[1:04:47] perspective yes amen amen natural
[1:04:50] drinking takes everyone out of
[1:04:51] perspective they can't drive they can't
[1:04:53] walk they can't talk they can't do
[1:04:55] anything normally because their senses
[1:04:57] are actually DED but this Holy Ghost and
[1:05:00] wine does the opposite amen we can see
[1:05:03] life really for what it is I'm on my way
[1:05:06] to heaven shouting Victory amen my
[1:05:08] trials aren't actually that bad
[1:05:10] Hallelujah why cuz God's on the throne

[1:05:16] going to come on the scene how I don't
[1:05:18] know but I'm drinking Hallelujah I'm
[1:05:20] just happy being a happy drunk why cuz
