and Jesus Christ name Amen amen thank you musicians morning everyone visitors here god bless you Ilana Emma systematic Oh bless you just you feel at home see if this thing works are we ready to go here we go I'm trying something different let's go to Colossians 1:15 I have the Spanish too Colossians 1:15 and then we're going to go to the Book of Isaiah it's just right here try Stephens had a a good week and Colossians 1 and 15 C so as the image of the invisible God the speaking of Jesus the firstborn of every creature for by him all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence for a place the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself and to himself I say whether they be things in heaven I mean things and earth or things in heaven and you who are sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled and thus and the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and Unruh provable in a sight if you continue in the faith grounded and sealed and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven there of where of I Paul am made a minister amen and let's just go to Isaiah Isaiah 43 and 21 this is a bit of a bit of a context for teeth Isaiah 43 and 21 that says this people have our form for myself they shall show forth my praise I mean I trust you can say that's me that describes me I mean god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to talk about this morning I want to talk about the anointing and what it should produce because when a Spirit comes into a person a certain life as is manifested now it sees here in 1st John 2 it says my little children these things write I unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin wait oh I'll leave that there sorry I'm just this is there's a bit of an experiment this morning if you don't mind because I won't even want to understand hallelujah so I think it's worth it so it's just let's just fear with me you may learn some Spanish amen and then I think we're all go away but in Richland but let's go to first John and 2 and 1 it says it says here hallelujah God God made us a certain way he formed us yeah he's even a bit too warm yeah so I lit up for the slice he getting cooked that one my gosh I mean I mean my goose to be cooked too early God has made us for a purpose he's here in 1st John 2 and 1 my little children these things write I unto you that you may send not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is a propitiation for our sins and not our sins only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments and he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments as a lie and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily as the love of God perfected we're here by know we know we that we are in him and he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even he even as he walked this verse seven so I don't have it there so we should walk now a safe way so if we say we are in Christ where are new creatures in Christ then we should walk as he walks so we should live as he lived now we understand that doesn't mean moving to Israel and and and living in Galilee and you know you know putting on robes and and and and hang out with some fishermen and calling him their disciples and you're doing the things he naturally did but the life that was in him now then just stay in Jesus Christ but it went into his church because we know that our Lord Jesus as the head of the body that we read so we are we are the body he's the head and we are the rest of the body and through the body things are done that's like the brain it says they'll go reach over and and and pick up your phone now the brain can't do it it's got to send a signal to the hand and then the hand picks up the phone and then so everything from the brain goes into the body and then the body does what the brain wants it to do it's the same thing that you're the Bible says we have the mind of Christ so the same mind that was in him should be in us so they're mirror therefore we should live we should walk as he walked so the same life that was in him should be in us and so the same characteristics of nature he had we should have I mean I believe the bride the same character in nature he had is and is in the church is in the Bride of Christ in this last day because remember if we are if we are Christians today it's no longer I that lives it's not that's not you living anymore I pray you died one day you died to your old self you gave your heart completely to Jesus Christ you fully surrendered yourself and it's no longer you living it's him living in you I mean because to be to be a Christian is to be christ-like and the only way you can do that is not by trying to mimic him but it's his life coming into you and he is the Christian in you that's how we can that is how we can be a believer today as if he comes unto you and lives his life out of you and I'm so glad by the death of us cross he can and he does hallelujah and he continues to do so now Jesus went when he was here on earth he commanded his disciples to take this word unto Jerusalem and Samaria you're even to the uttermost parts of the earth the gospel had to be preached to every creature and so now he left a work for his disciples to do right so the book of X now the book of X we call up the Acts of the Apostles but it's actually the X of the Holy Spirit which is Jesus in the Apostles and they took that same gospel and then they begin to preach it wherever they were sent by the Spirit of God so God uses his body to finish his work upon the earth I mean God has no hands but your hands God has no feet on the earth but your feet God has no mouth on the earth but your mouth amen God has to use a body to finish his work hallelujah and the only way the only way his work can be finished as when God comes and dwells in a person and uses that person to finish his work because otherwise it's just man's idea it's just man's religion because it's it's it's men man is the boss of us now I think this is how it should be done the set should be done but if it's if it's God God leading the people then it's not it's not man's work it's God's work hallelujah so now the anointing the anointing will produce a life if we're Christians we are producing a life it's more than nice singing it's more than quoting scripture or quoting a prophet of God it is a life that is to be produced and that's what God is looking for he's looking for a people upon the earth that are just like him hallelujah it's just like in like in Leviticus I don't have it on the on the on the PowerPoint but they would cut down so so when when the when the grain or the week was was ripening was growing you know if you look at a wheat field it does not grow at the same rate there's some that's they're ready to be happy harvested there's some that still green but the events that they all come to the same maturity but the first part of the harvest - to come to maturity that would cut it down and that and the priest would waver before the God before God thanking God that the rest of the field will come to the same life the same maturity as the one being waived and it's the same thing with us now so on the day of Pentecost a wave sheaf was cut down Christ was cut down as waved and that life was waved over the people because God was giving thanks there's more in the field that a Kanak gonna come forth like him gonna come forth like me I'm going to produce a people that are exactly like this life that was waved over the people Alleluia amen and there and there was there was the woman at the well was in the upper room there was Peter James and John in the upper room there was Matthew the tax collector all different kinds of people you know the doubt announced the publicans and sinners there in the upper room and God waived a life over there hallelujah saying saying the life has been waived of you is going to be produced in you I'm in the same nature the same character everything he is we become by His grace hallelujah and it's the same thing this message is not a bunch of sermons this message is not a bunch of doctrines this message is a life being ways it's the original life being way and God took a redeemed son so a man that was born and said shake their iniquity come to the world speaking lies just like you and I and he fully surrendered his life to Jesus Christ and he was filled with the Holy Spirit and God manifested through that man I pray God make us like this not not just a carbon copy like we will become a little brother branham but the nature of the life that was in him which was Christ would be lived out I mean Sagarika redeemed son and he waved it over the people over the earth saying this is what I produce this is what Calvary produces this is what my blood makes hallelujah and he's showing us these things because he wants you to see oh God you'll make me like that yes Holloway and not the same discernment and the same gift here were not all prophets but that same life that same character God is looking for character and a people and as anointing will do it yes hallelujah amen so that's why when you when you when you when you hear the tapes you read the message it's a life just like this this is a record of a life from Genesis to Revelation it's a record of a life and it's a love letter to you and it's a love letter because the reason it's a love letter is because you fall in love with him and then he begins to show his life in this word hallelujah begins to show this is me here this is what I did here this is what I did with my people here this is what I did here this what I'll do for you hallelujah but it's because but you got to into and trail of relationship with Jesus Christ first and then it becomes alive otherwise it's just learning that's why we have it can be a very to injured sword we have we your the ministry is mature in this age and we have very great teaching but the problem is so don't get me wrong teaching makes it very simple but then you can just learn it and say well I understand it without the life you understand what I'm saying but it's so beautiful that teaching is so you know the right things you can just make I'm here like yellow brother Lonnie you hear him teach and you think why don't I never see that before it's so obvious because there's that teaching gift they're taking the word and making it plain and so anyone can actually actually they can understand what he's teaching that doesn't mean they have the new birth because it where's the life because looking for life no not an understanding yeah we don't gone to the rapture because we because we write a test cuz we write an exam that's not how it works but when the Spirit of Truth has come here lead you and guide you into all truth I mean he will lead you and guide you into all truth not just partial truth not just a little but the whole thing all truth on you glad were being led and guided I mean he's taking his word personally to you opening it up amen make your plane Laurey so he will produce a life and he will produce a life not you he will do the life he's Pete he's the life giver a mentor best people I've fought for myself I shall show forth my praise I mean they shall show forth my praise this is you this is you he has formed you for himself he hasn't formed you for anything else doesn't matter where you came from in this life you were formed your fashion you are moulded hallelujah you are made for him that you bring forth that you would show forth us praise hallelujah that's why it's so glorious you know whenever things get hard whenever things look like they're going sideways and the enemy comes in and misunderstandings whatever more I just say god you're so wonderful I just focus on home and how good is that's what we should do we should just praise Him I'm gonna I'm just gonna preach for a little bit we just give him thanks isn't he all together lovely isn't he all together wonderful I mean what he's done for you what he's done for me holy just just just to open our eyes I made a note just to look upon you know not just to maybe you're like when Jesus was here the first time many people thought he was a prophet so it's not just to look upon you so I think he's a prophet but God opens your eyes he's the Messiah hallelujah aren't you glad I mean then you see a ministry come in the end time people say oh he was a prophet he was anointed to be a prophet but then we we can see beyond the veil of the man who say there's Messiah speaking the Son of Man was in that man revealing himself and that same son of man is here Jesus Christ hallelujah I'm glad well I'm so glad we're living in this day anyway telling the people up in Papua New Guinea seven billion people on the earth and God found you here you know they they call that country the land that time forgot because a large part of the country only had first contact with the outside world in the thirties you know up in the highlands a big plateau it's like springtime where the beautiful climate and some Australians they floorplate up over there flying over these mountains they look at these all these villages most the populations up there contact first contact was in the 30s God didn't forget that place hallelujah and it's like us here we just walk we just walking around in life and doing what we think we should do and think God comes and our lives are never the same a man and why does he do that that we can show forth as praise thank you thank you Lord for saving me a trust that means something to you thank you for dying across from me Lord hallelujah now let's go to let's go to Hebrews 11 and we're going to speak about Moses I'm so glad I'm so glad to be a believer it doesn't matter how bad things look doesn't matter how hard life appears to be glory a man before the first bomb drops the Prophet says we're out of here hallelujah so kim-jong whatever his name you like your bombs Trump you do it Putin you just get it ready before the first bomb drops we're gone a meaning God look won't lose one of his Alleluia so he speed six hours on the road on the road to Emmaus with two of us disciples I love Luke 24 brother BAM says modern events and made clear by prophecy he goes to Luke 24 so she's what you see among you what you see these modern RVs 2017 are made clear by the prophecy and he's telling us you're in the resurrection Jesus is here you may not fully comprehend it's him but he walks with you see this is the main event I thought about you know it's not about you know here it and and what the Romans are doing and what the Greeks are doing and you know what the other world powers think they're doing in the and and the Jews wanting to start a revolt and you know it's not about all those things that were going on the main event is Jesus walking with his children and he was and he spent six hours walking with them because he wanted them to know beyond a shadow of a doubt the as me I'm fulfilling my word and you're part of my fulfillment you're part of the prophecy being fulfilled hallelujah because they member they had to go to the upper room hello sorry he wasn't just giving them information that they'd say oh that's nice no he walked with them to tell them you're part of this fulfillment you're part of the prophecy being fulfilled and that's the most glorious thing Jesus is walking with us does he walk with you he walks with you and he opens his word to you doesn't matter how you feel they would they were sad they weren't rejoicing skipping on the way to Emmaus I'm so glad to be a believer today oh yeah the Messiah was dead you know the church accountant we didn't hang himself the ministry was locked away someplace their world fell apart and here he comes he opens his word he said life isn't all that peachy but urine because you're fulfilling that glory amen amen so let's go to Hebrews 11 23 it's by faith Moses when he was born he was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the Kings commandment and by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season amen choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God I'm just going to read this again then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible so now here here's a man here's a man Moses you know who knows the story the story of Moses he has raised by Pharaoh's daughter he was he was his he was the next in line he could have been fairer if he wanted to be and that was a superpower of the age but he preferred he thought the reproach of Christ was greater riches than being absolute a god over a nation because the Pharaoh was God in that day he wasn't just a king he was a god what he said went absolute absolute control he could speak a word and and people would be wiped out he esteemed Moses now esteemed a shepherd stick two million people whatever a million people he took in the wilderness all the hardship all of the strife and the things that happened there in the wilderness he esteem that greater riches he would rather follow God then be be a God of a of a country now he followed Christ sees we just read that he followed Christ and now this this did something to him a life was manifested a life was manifested now I said that he was he could have been the next Pharaoh now if you have a so if a man embodies of God upon the earth what is he not yo what does he normally like he's not like a meek little lonely guy he's not a little humble person ever a real persona about him I'm invincible I can do what I want you know he'd have that kind of persona and he would have been raised that way because the royalty or not see this probably a few times before but the royalty and that day were the leaders of the army they were the gods of war now that's what Egypt produced in him but then he went forty years on the backside that it is it but that wasn't it it was God speaking out of a burning bush the anointing came his way God Himself came his way and he began to speak out of a burning bush and it changed his nature and then he went to Mount Sinai and God came down on the mountain and God began to reveal his word to his prophet and it produced a character in him so he went from being he a prince of Egypt to the most meekest man in all view now this this is what was produced by him being the Prince of the burning bush this is the character of Christ being made in a person under the blood of bulls and goats as well not even under the blood of Jesus Christ but he but because he walked with God he was made the meekest man in all the earth it produced a character in him the scribes and Pharisees read the same words they read the words Moses wrote down they were proud arrogant people what so what does that mean they they they received it in here and they wanted to be the big shots and they wanted to be the up and ups they wanted to be the big names among the congregation why is that because they learnt the message they were message believers the message of Moses we have Moses as their prophet we got his tapes we've got his books I do you what's it making what's it making in you because because the the prophet that the message came to on that day this is the character that was made that's the character that was made now this is an attribute of Christ's character being made flesh in a person by the anointing now how about you let's go to let's go to Matthew 1 girls looking for a life Matthew 1 & 18 down to verse 25 that says now the booth of Jesus Christ was on this wise weenus his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost when Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make a public make her a public example was minded to put her away properly but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived of her is the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all of us was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring for the son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us then Joseph being raised from sleep that as the angel of the Lord had bettered him and took unto him his wife and you heard not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus now this is all done it says in verse 22 now all this was done that it might be fulfilled with just spoken of the Lord by the Prophet so jesus becoming flesh God becoming flesh in a man I mean yo as a man was a fulfillment of a prophets word so a prophet prophesied and then it produced to life amen are you following me so there was a fulfillment of a prophets word and it produced a life now here we are now don't think I'm jumping way off and to suddenly feel someplace in there sports crowd but here we are now a prophet Isaiah prophesied many prophesied of Jesus coming and it produced a life as our Messiah now we've had a prophet stand and he said there's been brides Brides churches churches but there's got to come one and he speaks about she'll be she is him they you know they become one flesh Christ and his bride become one flesh that he says she is him that doesn't mean we become Jesus but it's because everything here is we become and I mean that our identity we are not I am NOT mr. Benjamin John glory that's not me real you know the world knows me is that but in reality my real identification as I'm mrs. Jesus Christ a man by his death burial resurrection I am mrs. Jesus Christ and that's what we are by one spirit we're baptized into one body Alleluia and he says that the two will become one speaking of husband and wife and this is the mystery of Christ and His Church hallelujah so so he begins to speak about the invisible Union and the choosing of a bride and different and different sermons and it's not to make us laugh or angry mad or sad but he's actually declaring something this is what the bride will be like this is the one he's choosing this is the one he's choosing and you happen just to find yourself to fit the criteria not by anything you've done you know yeah do you know what I mean that's like you're just walking along yes I David it hits Goliath bring me a man to fight the battle and God up in heaven I don't know how it each looking down said I will I'll bring you a man that fits the criteria of the person you're looking for Goliath and he brings a little shepherd boy bring me a man and he took God God says in Isaiah heaviness you know heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool what where is the place of my rest so he's saying basically bring me a place of my rest and here you are and God forms you a certain way I'm old you because he put up a seed in you before the foundation of the world and you find yourself hearing his word and something then you just says I fit that criteria by its grace I fit that criteria I'm the one you're looking for hallelujah you following me I read the Solomon bride books and at the end of reading those books I just think god I'm your shunammite hallelujah I'm the one you're looking for yeah that's what I got out of those books I'm your shunammite Holly I'm your bride you're looking for and in Solomon couldn't find it in the different ones but he found it in a half Gentile glory hallelujah you know you know and and one that the Israel wouldn't think would fit the criteria and here she is a man have you read those books you know what I mean glory I love it don't you you find yourself reading the word now maybe this is justice not just me and you read about all the precious promises and what he's done and you know the nature the other divine nature and all these things and you just begin to say Lord you're making me this Lord you're doing this working me you're molding mean I'm not a vessel of this sort this honor I'm a vessel of Honor amen and you found you found out of the muck and mire and you picked it up and you've washed it and slide it up you put it on your table hallelujah and then everything he poured into Christ he pours into me he pours into us church now let me I just find myself I find myself in that number and predestinated to meet the Lord I just find myself here you ask oh how did this work out well it's because he was guiding us and directing us and leading us and then you begun to realize this is why I went through these things that's why I hid this word this is why maybe Arthur scarves in the churches I was in and I wanted more is a deep calling to the deep yes hallelujah so the words of the Prophet produced God inspired them to prophesy to us God speaking saying this is what's going to be producer God fulfilled the word of the Prophet to produce Jesus Christ and God will fulfill the words of Malachi 4 to produce a bride and you've got actually comes the realization we are we have been made in as image we are one of them don't put it off way off in the future don't put it way off in the future you say well I have my battles of my struggles but are you growing in him hey going in grace is their life that's like you know when you have little children and they in them they want to walk and them they want to speak and them they want to do things that adults do but they may be too young they get frustrated yeah how our youngest she used to get so fishy she wanted to speak and she gets her angry because he had words and it was in here but she couldn't get it out but then who was I want to speak I want to walk I want to play I want to you know so if it because there's the life in there she'll she will become an adult we can't stop her becoming an adult keep feeding her and she just keeps living and eventually if the little terror she'll be yay big plus or minus summit somewhere in here but she'll be a fully formed mature adult because she's feeding she's drinking and she's feeding it's the same thing with you and I we may be just a newborn baby babe in Christ but there's a desire I want to walk with you Lord I want to speak of you I wanna you know I wanna I want to run I don't just wanna I don't just want to crawl I want to run it was still good and so as long as that life is in there it'll grow just feed it on the right things how's your diet you got to feed on spiritual things I mean feed on the word and it produces the Holy Spirit takes that wind it produces a life just drink and push out like a plant they drink the water they push out a limb and then fruit comes out hallelujah now where we go now this is the whys mean the whys means sort of star on the east they traveled west and they followed the star to find where Christ was in their day now I only put the scripture in here but you can read the whole chapter they go to Jerusalem Jerusalem has no idea what's going on the church world has no idea what's going on but they had seen the star you're the star that rose was actually a prophecy one of Balaam prophecies in the Book of Numbers a star would rise out of Jacob and brother Bram says that these wise men in the east they were trained by Daniel yeah they're there for peace were trained by Daniel because he taught them all the wisdom that the they had so that's why the wise men when they saw the star rise they looked in the scripture and they read Balaam's prophecy star would rise out of Jacob you read numbers 20 to 25 it's when one of his prophecies and they read that and they realized the king of the Jews is being born this is a fulfillment of that prophecy so they begin to follow the star and it says when they go to gone to Jerusalem they have no idea what's going on what do you mean the words fulfilled today what do you mean this and thus America foreign relations even an revelations tn8 211 what do you mean what do you mean a mighty angel descended the world has continued as it always has now Christ is here I mean the angel of the Covenant is here which is the Holy Ghost he is the Holy Ghost it's not scary hallelujah and he's to lead us into our inheritance glory to God and what is the fullness of our inheritance is the adoption to wit the change of the body and we are on our way oh yeah and nothing just keep walking with him just enjoy him sometimes we put pressure on ourselves and this and this and this no just enjoy him a minute say Lord I want a date with you you and you pray and you read and you listen just enjoy it it's not I've got to work this out and this and this I just listen and say Lord this is glorious hallelujah and God will do more for you than you realize just enjoy him that's all you need to do it's a great seat just yes enjoy isn't he lovely isn't he wonderful so now but they had a revelation when they found him and when they had heard so they went back so they came out of Jerusalem they follow the star family the young child was now that a revelation they they brought him gifts so it says and when they coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto Him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh so they had a revelation now this is what the anointing when the anointing becomes flesh this is what it will produce and this is what these gifts a signifier gold gold frankincense and myrrh now this is from God's gifts always find me a place in 63 jehovah he is deity and he became a child he became in the form of sin that he might redeem the sinner so that's me and you Claire yeah I put I always put myself in these quotes I got redeemed you read between the lines I've been redeemed hallelujah that he might redeem the sinner well he has Here I am I've been redeemed Allu you see there's the whole thing now look how beautiful those gifts foot into Jesus Christ see gold speaks of his deity now they wasn't he the heathens they're inspired by God there wasn't imagining something that proves right there even the Magi that they did see the supernatural because their own gift what they offered identified and spoke well of their testimony that they did see the supernatural lights because why it speaks perfectly they brought gold deity they brought frankincense which is service and they brought murder for his death when he was a baby see even as a baby that a revelation this is the reason he's come amen that he would be showing that deity would be put to death in the flesh that he might redeem fallen man Ilia so gulf deity so God put into service to die for you and I they had a revelation friends they saw a stock coming out something inspired them what are we going to take to this King gold frankincense and myrrh I mean let's go they they had more clue of what's going on then the church world did hallelujah I tell you what the star in every age will lead you to where Christ is the star and every age will lead you and that's why we've seen a messenger come which is the start of the age and if you follow that star he'll point you to where Christ in his wood in this hour hallelujah and you will have a revelation this is what the anointing is to do in this hour a man it should make you into his image wholly to take you in a rapture hallelujah isn't it glorious I mean this is this is what the star will do so don't get about then you go on YouTube see but what if you go back into Jerusalem the church world that's all confusion what do you mean a star where's it mean to be born what's going on what are these people doing coming from afar with these gifts and saying where is he born King of the Jews they should have had a sign I'm not saying this is a joke but they should have had a sign on me on the gate of Jerusalem if you're looking for the King of the Jews go this way to Bethlehem you'll find him in a manger because that's where the Scripture city would be born but they had no idea to keep following the star children I trust you heaven you found him born hallelujah but it because it's not a baby in a manger now he's the resurrected Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever yeah now let's go to it so this is this is Paul speaking maybe I'll put this in the wrong place but he says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live not yet i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so now because we River Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in Jesus Christ the Bible tells us but it doesn't just end up there then he emptied himself into his church amen he said in the last days I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh hallelujah and that and we fit in that category amen yeah you know you're the prophecy of Joel doesn't matter about all the false souls out there is genuine dollars there's genuine believers and it'll produce a genuine life and so he's saying now I don't live pull saying I don't live anymore Christ lives in me amen so that and the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God so it's not his own faith anymore it's God's faith God's own faith in Him hallelujah now this is part of the this is what the and nothing should produce in us brother Bram never did away with this after the Lord said it's actually recognizing the wood for your own he never did away with this this is still part of the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's still part of it you can't take away from the work so this is what they this is what the anointing will produce in a life when God is in a person you will have love don't you love them as an amazing isn't it isn't it great that the principal one he puts first as love I mean because if you have love you will have joy as any wonderful doesn t make you happy when you think about them this is not just some mental gymnastics you think yes like you think about your spouse and how wonderful they are how much they mean to you doesn't that give you joy hallelujah and now doesn't that give you peace because you're thinking about your relationship doesn't he want yo you just think about the Lord don't you love him doesn't he make you happy I mean living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising justified freely forever one day is coming oh glorious day or half of the song goes you know doesn't that give you joy hallelujah one day that didn't Christ arise and it's done and I'm off Allu you are you afraid I'm not afraid why not because I love them and it's not a human love is a divine love it should be God the love of God in your heart I trust you love them and it gives you joy now that also gives you peace because if he took care of your son did Annie Annie made Calvary more than a story but a reality to you that's why people get so burdened with their sins and they want to you know because God is actually telling them I died for you I poured my life out upon the earth to redeem you hallelujah now if you have that now does that not give you long suffering for others I'm just breaking this down but doesn't it give you long suffering for others because if he loved you when you did not deserve it none of us deserved it and that gives you joy and you know he's in control of everything doesn't that give us long-suffering if people do all kinds of crazy stuff and you wonder where they go you can bear with them and lift them up in prayer and just continue with them but then also doesn't that give you gentleness amen Moses was the meekest man in all the world doesn't it make you gentle because we know that this is all his doing and he sovereignly chose you 7 billion people in the world yet he chose you what about the other 6 point whatever billion people that were upon the earth any but that day he found you amen doesn't that make it and goodness and faith doesn't doesn't this just this just love love and faith actually I like husband and wife because love actually produces faith in him amen and faith in him produces love Alleluia that's chosen as the that's why so isn't he wonderful I'm not just trying to make you think of some emotion but is he really wonderful to you doesn't he glorious I mean meekness temperance against such there is no law hallelujah I'm so glad and and the beautiful thing about these is we don't have a five-point plan now I've got a 12-week I'm in training for 12 weeks so I need to produce some more gentleness we don't have that a sheep biers wool sheep life is like an apple tree it grows apples or an orange tree grows oranges that olive tree grows olives it doesn't have a meeting okay it's springtime now let's have a meeting in the orchard now we need to up up our quota of olives we're a 10 behind come on boys we can do it yeah this year and this is what we're gonna do know it just lives and absorbs the sunlight through its leaves drinks and new trees in the water through its roots hallelujah yes praise to God and it produces olives okay hello olive trees I know that's not you just gotta just relax it doesn't mean you just don't care about God and wanting to serve it you know just just just go loose but you just yield and let him live yield and let him love amen now let's go to Exodus 30 I heard a brother preach on a bit of this and it blessed me so there's got Exodus 30 in 22 they're speaking me of the anointing oil how we done we're gonna write extra 30 in 20 - oh wait there we go XS 13 22 I'm gonna read down to 31 okay so moreover now there's a reason you know in the Old Testament they didn't just it's not a haphazard thing why certain things will mix with certain things and things were made a certain way God's showing something to you God's showing something so moreover the Lord spake unto Moses saying take thou also under the principal spices of pure myrrh 500 shekels and of sweet cinnamon half so much even two hundred and fifty shekels and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels and cassia five hundred shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary firming and four end of oil olive and him and thou shalt make it in an oil of holy ointment and ointments compound after the art of the apothecary it shall be a holy anointing oil and thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation where with and the Ark of the testimony and the table and all his vessels and the candlestick and as vessels and the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offerings and all his vessels and the lover and his foot and thou shalt sanctify that that they be most holy whatever touches them shall be holy and thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them that they made minister unto me the priests office and thou shalt speak the children of Israel saying this shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations so now notice everything got anointed by this anointing oil so everything had to be anointed not just the not just the priesthood but every every implement used in the worship now there's a reason why I don't have this on here but there's a reason why the mixture of the anointing oil in the beginning has has this mixture of different spices now this is showing this is what happens when you get anointed something happens to you that produces something me but we are kings and priests to God right so we are royal priesthood a holy generation amen so this is this is what we are so now it says so thou shalt make under the principles so we're back to back to verse 23 again take now also under the principle spices pure myrrh 500 shekels now mirror we understand speaks of bitterness there's a bitterness in the Christian walk whether we like not there is a bitterness a mint associated with it but it's not all bitter and this actually doesn't mean to me this does not mean it's better to keep his word because those that love him it's a joy I mean to walk with him according to his word but it's how the believer can get treated and be despised actually looked down upon thought less of I mean because yes like Jesus he died with a broken heart on Calvary where the blood and the water separated when they when the soldier pierced him in the side with the spear as his blood and water came out of his side and that speaks of a broken heart so it wasn't you know it was the scourging and the beating and the whippings and everything else the crowd thorns but when he died he had a broken heart what this and there's bitterness is sadness associated because he came to his own and his own received him not Here I am I'm your Messiah I can make everything fine this is a greater than Solomon is here and they had a they had like an immature million and the first part of Solomon's rule peace was in the nation all the neighbors around them fear them fit yoyo feared feared God everything they had peace he sees a greater than Solomon is here it's imagine if you know we know they had to reject him that we would come in but imagine if they actually rallied around this is the Messiah and the high priest takes up as vestments and puts it on puts it on our Lord Jesus says you you're a high priest you're our King you're our Messiah they really around the gift imagine what would have happened ou would have been a glorious time but they had to reject him that we could come him I'm so thankful Lord because we were not even part of the economy of God we weren't even in his agreement amen no so it's five hundred shekels of that and of sweet cinnamon half as much that's two hundred fifty shekels now cinnamon so it means to erect so people begin to stand up and then calamus if you're still there two hundred and fifty shekels as well now that so that so that actually means a reed as erect or to a resemblance a rod especially for measuring so now this is this is what God is going to make an appeal there's going to be bitterness but they're going to be standing up I mean they're gonna be they're gonna be this way and then now we have cinnamon now I'm gonna make sure I got this right here oh and also calamus sorry the the meaning of the root word it means to create so it means to erect that is create by extension to procure especially by purchase so God's actually sag now I purchased these ones these ones who have been anointed with my anointing oil they're standing up on their feet they're not beaten down by the enemy and I've purchased them Jesus purchased us on Calvary's tree I mean he paid the ransom hallelujah he paid a debt we could not pay I mean we couldn't couldn't pay it at all he came I'm gonna rent some these ones I'm gonna make no royal priesthood Dean offer praises and worship to me hallelujah amen so now we have we have been purchased and then now cassia 500 shekels since the twice as much as the twice as much as the myrrh I mean no the same amount so as the moon that's it so now the the meaning of this it means so the root of us means to to contract or bend the body or neck in indifference so to show yielding when you bend the neck when you bow to someone you're actually giving them honor so here's the people now who have been now this is what it will produce in your life right you will you will be standing up we're not a downtrodden people we're victorious are we not we have the victory through Christ Jesus our Lord we're more than conquerors what is what is a more than a conqueror it means it's just a complete absolute victory it wasn't a close-run thing we just wiped them out hallelujah because we're more than conquerors through him it's not you and your what do you think you can do Oh Lord you're the captain of the host you're in charge of this battle you fight you help me Lord fight my battle for me I mean it's the ghost of the king she's in the middle of a battle her life and her life her people are in jeopardy she doesn't say cuz I think she could have she could have said to the maybe the palace guards get your swords go to havens house we're gonna deal with this she may have could have done it I don't know but she went to the one who would fight the battle for her o my king my husband my lord amen you know the rest of the story don't you and then his wrath is turned against Haman and there's a victory a me because he fought the battle for her Alleluia aren't you glad now so it means what and then also olive oil is - it's a and after a shekel of the century and an olive oil and an him so olive oil it means so as yielding illuminating oil so it gives light hallelujah so now now Paul he took a scripture that was attributed to Jesus they see is that weird be a light to the Gentiles and Jesus was the lights of the Gentiles and Paul was as well because the same life and Jesus came in - Paul have you were in the book of X pulse it would be a light to the Gentiles because he was anointed with this anointing oil to give light amen hey following me this is so this is what the anointing oil should produce in your life when it doesn't just come into your spirit realm but goes into your soul it would be now you're standing up on your feet and faith doesn't matter what wind blows tossed to and fro we're not tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine anymore doesn't matter what people say all this and this and this will hold on what about this it's also written I mean and they should be a witness more than a just a human thing but there should be a witness in your soul that's God or it should be that's not God and it should be well and and if there's a question mark you should actually say well Lord you're not an author of confusion my sheep hear my voice it's not they might hear my voice they hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow Amen so that means we his sheep know his voice do you know his voice when his voice speaks Steve do you recognize God that's you speaking better than a stranger there should be something in you a flashing red light should be warning danger something's not right here you should have that in you I pray you do amen so it's a people now that we're we're not tossed to and fro I trust you're not you're standing on the Rock of Ages I meant but yet you're yielded to him see Moses was the meekest man in all the world you see mature wheat bounce to the Sun a bounce of the Sun and it doesn't stand like this wheat that's standing away this is not fully mature not fully ripened I mean but mature one bells they see brother Burnham he exalted Jesus Christ more than any man I know lelou you ain't man so now this is what should be produced if the anointing oils there hallelujah we have some musicians to count on you glad it's his life it's his doing this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous and outside Amen Alleluia you got amen your level low this morning how god is good he'll produce himself and you just yield so I don't understand just yield just just walk with Him what's that um I wanna well let Cygnus they stick number 18 all over the world the Spirit is moving because the Spirit is moving
