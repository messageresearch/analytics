Oh yeah. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, again, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Good evening. God bless you all. How's everyone? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Had a wonderful day. enjoyed the games and fellowship and mainly the presence of the Lord. Amen. It's been so good, eh? Who enjoyed the service this morning? [music] Who had the Lord speak directly to them? Amen. We're so thankful for that, aren't we? Who's under expectation for tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, the Lord's going to sweep by our way, touch our lives. [music] He's a supernatural God. Amen. The prophet said where he is, the supernatural is happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I believe he is here already and I believe he's going to do supernatural things. He's going to go beyond our expectation cuz that's he loves to do that kind of thing. [music] And I believe we're in for a treat. I believe that lives are going to be changed tonight. [music] &gt;&gt; And I say, Lord, start with me. Amen. So let's dedicate our lives to the Lord. Let's invite him. I I don't think I could ever get tired of saying it. He's a personal God. He wants to come where you are, where I am, and change our lives. Amen. So, you say, "Well, I don't have a need." Well, what about just just pray for the person next to you or maybe someone who's not even here. &gt;&gt; God can go anywhere, touch anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's just commit our lives to the Lord. You have a need, just lift it before his great throne and [music] Amen. So, let's uh let's bow our heads, shall we? And let's pray. Almighty God, hallelujah. Lord, we're so thankful, Lord. We can we can praise your holy name, dear God. Lord, we're so glad that you are the great eternal one. And Lord, you have come down, I believe, into this place to have a conference with us, Lord, to come and change our lives, Lord, to meet needs, Lord, to fill us with your Holy Spirit, to cast out the enemy, Lord, to bring healing into our wounds, our hearts, our lives. Lord, we love you so much, Father. We pray, dear God, that your great anointing would overshadow us this night, Lord. May we be under the shadow of your great wings. Father, cover us in your blood. I pray that every spirit that's not of you would be bound in the name of Jesus Christ. The devil wouldn't be able to do anything in this service. May the faith of your people just paralyze him now in Jesus Christ's name. [music] And I pray, Father, that you would anoint brother Jonathan mightily, Lord. We're under great expectation, Lord, to hear from you. And we're so thankful, Lord, you come where you're invited. So we invite you here. Come by our way, Lord. Touch our lives, Lord. I have needs, Lord. We all have needs, Lord. Lord, there's many, Lord, on our hearts who are not even here. I pray you go their way, Lord. Those who are streaming, Lord, be their abundant portion, too, Lord. May it be like they're on the front row. The atmosphere is so present, Lord, of your presence in their in their midst wherever they are watching this. Dear God, we love you. We commit the service into your hands for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless. Lord. Hi. [laughter] &gt;&gt; How are you all? &gt;&gt; Like like when you're up here, even though there's a lot of people, you want to connect, you know? You got to like I got to get to know you. You got to get to know me. We got to see what we've [music] been up to. How's it going? How's how's life? You know, are you walking in victory? Are you uh overcomers? &gt;&gt; Okay, so there are two little principles that we have to sort of if we just dissect that real quick. If you walk in victory, that means you are a victor. &gt;&gt; Now, in order for you to be a victor, you had to have someone that you had to victor against. &gt;&gt; So, you had to have some sort of challenge that you had to overcome. Then you walk in victory. So, you still walking in victory. And the same principle remains with an overcomer. You had to have something that you have to overcome. Like if you don't have any challenge to overcome, you're not you the Lord can't make you an overcomer. So we wonder why we get all these things in life that try and test us. It's to make us victors, victorious, to make us overcomers. But I know that we are that that if God is for us, then who can be against us? And I have a confidence [snorts] in the Lord that that even when we can't, he can. [music] Like there's a point where we can get pushed back, but then no more. Even [music] if we start losing, there's a point we can only lose so far. Like who's been down to the bottom? Yeah, me too. And you know what I found out about the bottom? And you guys that have and late guys and girls, brothers and sisters that have been there, you'll find the amazing principle about this place that we call the bottom is that it's actually remarkably stable. You can go like that. Oh, this is the bottom. And two things I learned about being at the very bottom. One, it's quite [music] stable. And two, the Lord is there. &gt;&gt; The bottom suddenly didn't become this dark hole that it was scary. It's like this is all the bottom is, is it? You see, when you're in the Lord, there's stability to everything. If I remember in the word of God, it talks about a bottomless pit. There is no bottom on that pit. There's a place that that a man a woman can go when you when you just reject everything that doesn't have any bottom to it. It just there's no there's no end to the depth you'll go down. It's a bottomless pit. Our bottom is not a bottomless pit. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a place that has that has an end to it cuz the Lord said he'll not test you above what you're able. &gt;&gt; So there's a bottom to everything. &gt;&gt; This that the bottom ain't going to fall out from under you. The Lord's the king of the mountain and the king at the very bottom. Every place you can go. David said, "If I make my bed in the depths of hell, you're there. &gt;&gt; No matter where I go, you're there." That's the God we serve. It don't matter what situation you get into, the Lord is there and he's not ashamed to be with you in every situation. Like the powerful experience when I had when I had to walk and see my brother swinging on a rope dead, I thought even in that situation, I I'm I'm going to go there cuz the Lord would come here. He's not scared of that. He's not scared of anything. There's no no there's no place the Lord won't go to find [music] you and to find me. That's what I've learned about the Lord. He He's not He's a real man. &gt;&gt; He's strong. He's fearless. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. It's going to be such a good service tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just that the the Lord's going to bless us in a powerful way. &gt;&gt; In a in such a mighty and powerful way. This is a song that the the the Glors actually keep on introducing songs to the church. We've had this one for a while, but they always do a special and it's always very anointed and then we sing it as a you know, like a it's a new church song. So, this was one of the ones that they they they sung. Let's go. [music] [music] Jesus blinded all my darkness, [music] spark my heart within. [singing] His grace and mercy lit a passion. Consume my sin. [music] Now like a city on a hilltop, I'll shine through the night. [music] I am a lamb made for his glory. [singing] I will not hide. [music] Cuz I've been touched by I've been touched by his fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. I'm going to shout it from [music] the rooftop. Shout it until everyone has heard. This love will never be estive [music] and wild and free. I'm overtaken by [music] his power. His spirit in me. His spirit in me. His spirit [music] in me. Oh yes. My fire. So let the world [music] come and watch me burn. I'm going to shout it from the rooftop. Shout it till everyone [music] has heard. I've been touched by touched [music] by his fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. I'm going to [music] shout it from the rooftop. Shout until everyone [music] has heard. Jesus has changed my name. His name be lifted high. This [music] holy fire is burning inside of me. Jesus [music] has changed my life. His name be lifted high. This holy fire burning [singing] inside of me. I [music] cannot hold it inside. I cannot keep it quiet. This [music] holy fire burning inside of me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot keep it. This holy [music] fire is burning inside of me. And I've been touched by I've been touched by his fire. [music] So let the world come and watch me burn. I'm going to [music] shout it. Shouting for shouting to everyone [music] has been touched by [music] fire. So let the world know what we [music] going to shout it from the rooftop. Shouting tillone [music] has heard.

[applause] &gt;&gt; Where do I go when there's no one else to turn to? Who [music] do I talk to when no one wants to listen? And who do I lean on when there's no foundation stable? [music] I like these guys. [music] Where do I go? Where do I go? When there's no [music] one else to turn to, who do I talk to? Oh, and no one wants to listen. Who do I lean on? Oh, and there's no foundation [music] stable. I go to the rock. Oh, I know he is able. I go to the rock. I go to the rock of [music] my salvation. I go to the stone that the builders reject. I run to the mountain and [music] the mountain stands by me. Oh, and the earth all around me is sinking [music] sand. On Christ the son rock I stand. When [music] I need a shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the rock. Where do I hide [music] till the storms have all passed over? Where do I run to when the [music] winds of sorrow threat?

We have um brother, let me just get the list. There was a call tomorrow's list. Brother Joseph uh the Inquanas and the Jeffre and then the Shakina Church. So just make your way up when it's your turn. God bless you. Um I came across a song last week and um really felt the Lord place it on my heart and it was just reaffirmed this morning with what brother John was preaching about. is talking about the the one lamb out of the 100 and going after it. Um, and I really feel these lyrics are written for that one lamb. I see you walking by the ravaging of sin in your life. You can't deny how [music] my [singing] heart goes out to you. If I could offer just one word or two. If you only knew, you were chosen for a rightuous son of God. If you only knew his perfect plan for you, you'd let him in your heart. heart and sin right there would lose its hold. You'll have real purpose and a go. God has so so much more [singing] in store for your life. Perhaps decisions you have made have brought you to this valley. Oh so low. But your debt [singing] so already paid.

[music] [applause] [applause] just as the um shakina church are coming up. I'll just just talk a little bit about uh this one and I've brother Ben and sister Christina are going to watch this one. Okay, is that all right? Because brother Ben wasn't at any of the practices anyway. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; But it kind of is nicer. I did actually feel in my heart that they can just sit down and just enjoy um their fellowship singing and praising the Lord. I know he'll say it's not mine, it's the Lords, but I want to say it that way. Is that right? Cuz he's got skin in the game or money in the bank. [laughter] So, my my um I was a little bit naughty this year writing a song because I like I've got about a 50% strike rate on being inspired and just being like my little musical brain figuring out things. I run about 50%. I I felt like the song we sung last night which was um Rocky Revelation that was kind of inspired but then other ones I write I just kind of but I wanted to challenge people this year a bit, you know, and have a few key changes and different chords and stuff like that. And um Latabo didn't think we could pull this off [laughter] and maybe we won't. It might just be maybe just a total flop. All right. But but these these brothers and sisters are they've done this for years now. So they're getting really good. And I had full confidence in them that you know you can all do this. So So they've yeah they've really practiced a lot to um yeah just to to do this. Plus, we've got a friendly competition going on with um RFBF and those ones that do church um items, man. Have you got one tomorrow, haven't you? Is it? No, it's No, we actually Yeah. You know, we do it for the Lord as Christians. Okay. Who laughed? [laughter] &gt;&gt; I was being serious, bro. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay, we ready. &gt;&gt; Whenever you're ready, kiddo. With every breath I can feel [music] it come. [singing] Every step it brings me closer home. Every thought comes a brand new song. I sing of Jesus all day long. Every hour there's a voice that's [music] calling. Every minute something else is drawing. Every moment there's a [music and singing] deeper longing. I want to walk on the streets of glory. [music] With my [singing] eyes I'm going to see him with my [music] ears. I'm going to hear him with my hands. I'm going to touch him with my mouth. I'm going to testify. [music] His name is Jesus. He's the one that has redeemed us by his blood. He has saved us, saved us, changed the so mighty Jesus. He's the king of all the angels. To [music] him, [singing] I'll sing my neverending praise.

When I survey, when I survey, the one grace cross on which the praise How glory died. My richest [music] gain. I count the loss and pour [singing] content on all my pride for it. [music] Yes. &gt;&gt; That I should [music] mo save [music] in the dead of [music] Christ my God. [music] All the main things [music] that char me most. [singing] [music] I sacriy them to his [music] blood. See from his hand [music] his hands his [music] feet. Sorrow and love. Sorrow and love. [music] Oh me go down [music] such love. Oh, [music] sorrow [singing] me. [music] [singing] [music] Oh, reach the ground [music] where the whole round [singing] [music] of nation. There [music] were an offering. We find you small. Love [singing] so amazing. Love so amazing. [music] divide [music] my soul. My [music] life love so amazing. [music] Love so amazing. [music] So divine, [music and singing] divine, [singing] my soul, my life, my own. [singing] [music] worthy. Worthy, worthy [music and singing] is the lamb who was slain. Holy, holy is [singing] he. We sing a new song. We sing a new song [singing] to him who sits on heaven's mercy [music] seat. We sing holy, holy, holy, holy, holy [music] is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is [music] to come. For him, all [music] creation, I sing. Praise to the King of Kings. [music] You are my everything and I will [music] adore you. Oh, I will adore you. [music] Broken rainbows of [music] living color flashes of lightning rose of thunder. Blessing [music] and honest strength and glory and power be to [music] you the only wise king. [music] Yeah. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is [music] and is to come. With all creation I sing praise [music] to the King of Kings. You are my everything and I will adore you. [music] Oh yes, I will. [music] Oh adore you. [music] Filled with wonder. All [music] struck wonder at the mention of your name. Jesus, [music] your name is power, breath of living water, such a marvelous mystery. [music] Holy, holy, holy is the [music] God Almighty was to come. With all creation, I sing. Praise [music] to the King of Kings. You are my everything and I will adore you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you just love praising him? Doesn't it just feel right being in [music] his presence? Everything just seems just seems perfect when you are in divine presence and all the worries just fade from view. The troubles of life fade from view. I believe that's why in a world that is falling apart, I believe God has so manifested [music] and vindicated his presence among us to let us know that fear not. I'm with thee [music] &gt;&gt; and I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you. If you could just hear the voice of God speaking to your hearts that maybe in a more modern way of saying it, but I've got this. God would say to you young people, [music] I've got this. mamas and daddies and going through the troublesome things of life. But God just so real and so so present among us just letting you know that God is with you and he's walking with you and you're walking with him and just like Enoch walked with God. And then just one just just [music] another normal day just taking a walk with God and then all the sudden he was not for God took him home. I tell you you're in a supernatural walk and I know things [music] seem so common and so earthy and got bills that need to be paid and you're you're worried about your children maybe and some of the struggles they're going through. You may be going through the worst trial of your life when God takes you in a rapture. I tell you friends, there's something supernatural that has taken place. I I know the devil tries to block our view from it, but this message has placed [music] us in a supernatural walk with God. And we're a part of something that is that is so real and so dynamic. And and I I I believe that the rapture could be maybe just like a normal just like a meeting like this or it could just be a Wednesday night church service or it could be a Monday when the devil's fighting you so hard after a Sunday service. Hallelujah. There's just something real taking place in our lives. You know, that's why the Bible says don't despise the day of small things. I I tell you God, we heard it this morning. God hides himself in simplicity and he reveals himself in the same. And uh so I just want to greet you in the name of the Lord. And I've so uh so enjoyed the worship. I appreciate uh our brother leading us in in worship and and uh all of the musicians uh dedicating themselves to [music] uh create an create an atmosphere. And uh I believe that atmosphere is so important and uh I was telling uh our pastor, brother Ben, that the atmosphere just seemed uh so good and uh just feels good in here. And uh you know, we're in an atmosphere of believing and and and uh you know, in this kind of an atmosphere, all things are possible. And uh so you know, we uh maybe you brought some uh with you. you're going through some struggles or sickness or discouragement or uh maybe maybe you're feeling a little discouraged or backslid. Whatever it is, I just want to tell you this is your service. This is your meeting. This is your opportunity. And uh as we heard uh this morning uh God has heard the bleeding of the sheep and the the bleeding of the lambs. And I believe that uh I I believe that it was brother Brandham that said that we need that spirit touch. And uh cuz with that spirit touch, you'll go after the lost. You'll have a burden for the lost and lost souls. And you'll have a burden for one another. And uh so may we just uh have that real spirit touch moving among us in these services. And uh so we want to just say God richly bless you. It's just such an honor to be here and uh I know uh uh brother Wayne uh sends his greetings and uh brother Wayne would love to be here and and uh his heart is here uh with you all. Uh but uh just had to stay uh stay behind uh on account of his father and and uh so I know he would appreciate all of the prayers. Uh but you know uh what is important is that the Lord Jesus is here and and uh we do believe that that he is here and um so we just deem it a real honor to be here. My wife is here, Sister Laura, and uh just so glad that she could travel with me on this trip. And and uh we just uh on behalf of the church back home, True Word Tabernacle, and uh so many wanted to to greet you and and just to express their love to you. And uh so if you have your Bibles, we'll uh just turn to Zechariah the 4th chapter and uh we'll read the first seven verses. And then also we will read Psalms 110 and verse three. And just something that the Lord has uh been dealing with us in our hearts. And uh we would just uh pray that God would just uh just speak to your hearts and and give you strength and and uh just give you the the desire of your hearts. And [snorts] I'd like to speak on faith in grace. faith in grace and uh Zechariah the 4th chapter beginning at verse one. trust that everyone's had a good day and I so appreciate the opportunity to speak with brother John and I just uh have always been blessed by his ministry and his labor of love all these years uh ministering to God's people and uh so enjoyed the the service this morning and uh just looking forward to what God has for us uh through the remainder of the services. But Zechariah 4 and verse one, and the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, and said unto me, What seeest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold, a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof, and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?" Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord under Zerubabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Zerubable? Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it. Amen. Now Psalms 110 and verse three it says thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dw of thy youth. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. Now may God just add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated. Brother Brandham read this portion of scripture here in Zechariah the 4th chapter while preaching a sermon uh titled the message of grace. And he would read verse six where it says the word of the Lord unto Zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts. And then he would say do you see the message will not come by some great might or powers but by the spirit of God. I believe that we are in a Holy Ghost move. uh you know the world is in an ecumenical move and uh the they're a part of a of a Jezebel system uh that the world is just under that kind of an influence and uh influencing them away from God even though they may go to church and be religious but we're more than just churchgoers. We're more than just religious. uh we're more than just uh saying that we are message believers, but uh but saying that we're a message believer has a meaning to it. And that means that that the full word has been restored and the bride tree has been restored and that the bride tree is in full bloom. And that is meaning that Jesus said, "I am the vine, you are the branch and without me you can do nothing." And so this is a Holy Ghost move. This is it takes the energy of the Holy Ghost moving into the church to bring forth fruit and to bring forth life. And brother Brandham would say it like this. We've heard it so many times. The move is on for the bride. That is thus saith the Lord. And so I believe that we are in the greatest move of God that the world has ever known. And it's this move that is going to take us into our body change. And it's manifesting the promises of God and making them a reality in our hearts and and lives. Brother uh uh it was Paul that would say that it's the spirit of grace. And I believe that it is the spirit of grace. It's the working of grace among us in this hour. Now the prophet would say that we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and Zerubabel was a great prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building. And now he would say, I want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think. And this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord. And then when he did, he had laid the foundation stone. And it says, "Now Zerubabel has laid the foundation with his hands. He also shall bring forth the headstone." I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth a cornerstone. He shall bring forth the headstone. And we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the chief cornerstone and he's also the headstone. Now if we will think for a few mo minutes that the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the father. So immediately in reading this about Zerubabel, he is now going to take it to his own ministry and show that the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. In other words, rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit. Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. Not by organization, not by denomination, but by the Holy Spirit, God will bring forth the church in the last days. Now, the prophet of God that was in the message of grace. Then in the stature of a perfect man, he would say, "Christ never sent me to build organization. Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the powerhouse and abiding place of the spirit by his word. Now the prophet of God would repeat that again and would say by his word build up the individual to that place not building an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to sons and daughters of God. So we would see that it is the grace of God that has given us a message in the last days to restore us to the original faith and to build us up out of the word to powerhouses. I believe that that is what I'm looking at. I I'm not just looking at young men and and young ladies. And I'm not just looking at married couples throughout this building, but I'm looking at powerhouses that the message of the hour has built you to a place and a position in Christ to have perfect faith and perfect confidence in what God is doing in this age. And again, it's the working of grace in this hour. We have been restored back to a grace covenant. Amen. And that's why in Revelations 10, the prophet would identify who it was that was descending with an open book and he would say that is only Christ because it's the angel of the covenant. Amen. So, it's the covenant angel that has descended among us. And he's come with a promise. He's come with an open book. and your name is in that book and he is here to manifest everything that he promised for your life in this last days. And now so we are powerhouses of the spirit by his word. The prophet of God would go and he would talk about the pyramid and and how that the pyramid uh never had the capstone on it. And he would say, you know, he would take the American dollar and he would show you that the headstone was not even put on the pyramid. And then the prophet of God would show us how how perfectly uh tight that that that pyramid was built and the stones that weighed tons and and and how that they got them up in the air to to build them so perfectly on each other. And the prophet of God would say it had to be some kind of an atomic power that they had back there. And he would say now they had some kind of a tool that we don't have today that they could cut these stones so perfectly that it's it's a razor's edge. You you can't even the the that they so fit perfectly together. Amen. That it's a it's a razor's edge. Amen. Between them. The prophet of God would say, "So cut by the Holy Spirit, by God's great instrument and tool, that we'd be joined as one person." &gt;&gt; My let that sink in. Amen. God's great tool, which is the Holy Ghost. Amen. Would cut us and we'd be joined as one person. We are not divided. We should be one person. And it goes to show that no machinery can do that that way. It takes God to do that. No mechanics of organization, no lodges, none of these none of these things can ever do it. As good as their intentions are, they can never do it because it takes God to do this. The Holy Spirit. Amen. So that is what God is doing by his great tool, the Holy Ghost, is he's cutting our lives. He's molding us. He's shaping us. He's he's getting our own ideas away from us. Amen. He's getting all the worldliness out of us. He's molding character in us. Amen. And and and it's not one group and one church against the other group and the other church. It's not one pastor's idea versus another pastor's idea. God has brought us all under the headship of the vindicated word of the hour, which is the Holy Ghost move, manifesting his word of promise in this age. And it's all uniting us as one person. You know what that means? It means that God has got a body upon this earth. Amen. It used to be the anointed man Christ Jesus. Now it is the anointed bride body that has so come in tune with the word and the Holy Ghost in this hour that is God manifesting his power in a many member bride body. Now you see amen. The prophet of God would say it like this. He would say that I believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known. Now that was in 56 in the junction of time. And he would show us that there is he says I I see that there's been seven great junctions in the history of the world. And then he would show us, amen, that at every junction when God is going to turn a corner or there's going to be a dispensation change, he would call it a junction. He would say, "Now that is when the power of omnipotence is made manifest." Amen. And it's to show the people that God is about to do something. Amen. And the prophet of God is letting us know, amen, that what we have seen in this hour is the greatest vindication of omnipotence. I I I just want to declare unto you. Amen. This is what we have seen. It is the power of almighty God that has been put on display in this age to get our attention and let us know that we have turned the corner. That there is a dispensation change. Amen. That the lamb of God has stepped into view and that we can see that it's God working among us. It's God healing the sick. It's God that's raising the dead. It's God that's breaking the shackles. It's God that's preparing us to believe for all things. Now, the prophet of God says, amen, that when omnipotence speaks, the miraculous takes place. &gt;&gt; So, he was letting us know, amen, that omnipotence is actually God. And he's speaking in this last days and it's the miraculous that is taking place. And the prophet of God would would show us that there was a leper and he was full of leprosy. And one day he come to omnipotence and he said, "Lord, if thou will will make me whole, if you can clean me, then you I know you can clean me." And God looks at him and Jesus looks at him and says, "I will be thou clean." And that was omnipotence that spoke. and the miraculous takes place. Amen. Now, we know that leprosy is a type of sin. Now, here is a person that he has no hope. There is absolutely nothing scientific that can help that man. His his his his members are going to just rot and and decay and and he's going to lose maybe fingers and maybe lose a hand and amen. He has no hope for his condition, but he recognizes that omnipotence is upon the earth. And when he comes and says, "I know you can clean me if you'll do it." And look at the voice of omnipotence, it's grace, friends, that said, "I will be clean." You see, when omnipotence speaks, the miraculous takes place. Now we know that that leprosy is a type of sin and sin is unbelief and the problem with so many conditions is unbelief. So God sent a message to separate us from unbelief and to fix the problem in the human heart and declare the problem is you got to believe the word. Hallelujah. Because there's a battle going on and the battle is not for your senses. The battle is not just for your memory or for your reasoning or for your conscience or your eyes. The battle is for your heart. And the prophet of God said, if we can get that certain thing fixed and get the and get faith on the heart, that'll take God's word and begin to speak that promise and confess that promise. I tell you, we can confess the promise over our homes. We can confess the promises over our children. It's because that there is omnipotence that is reigning over our lives. It's dealt with the problem and it's fixed it in this age and we've come to a perfect faith that God said it. I believe it. It settles it and we expect the miraculous. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see what he was doing? He was proving that there's a junction taking place in the days of Jesus. He healed the sick. He raised the dead. He he opened the eyes of the blind. What was it? Proving to the people that the junction was there. You see, they nailed him to the cross. And all the while they were in the temple singing their songs about the lamb of God that was going to come and going to take away the sins of the world. and they were doing their religious duties under the old dispensation. But the whole time there was the lamb and they didn't recognize that they had come to a junction and God had vindicated his power was upon the earth and they just continue right on going. Amen. But you see, God tore the veil. God from [screaming] the top uh from the top to the bottom toward the veil into the holiest of holies. Letting them know that God is doing this. Man didn't do it. God is doing this. And letting you know that we've turned the corner, [screaming] that omnipotence is among us, that the miraculous is taking place, that God is changing hearts. It's grace, friends. Well, if thou was in the cornerstone, what about the headstone? Because the headstone is Christ. And it's that same Christ, the anointed word that has come in full view of this age. And God again has tore the traditional veil that has been hiding Christ from our view. And let us know [screaming] the lamb of God is in plain view again. And it's for every mom, every daddy. It's for every home. If you can see him in the power of his resurrection, it's the answer. &gt;&gt; You see, there was another junction and that Abraham, he had just had his name changed from Abram to Abraham. He had been waiting for the promise for 24 years. Well, we know the story and how that Abraham is a 99 year old man and Sarah's 89 and and the prophet of God actually take us takes us in a little illustration and how that Abraham is just you know Sarah woke up on the bad bad mood wrong side of the bed that morning and and uh you know she was grumbling and complaining and talking about Sodom and talking about, you know, the latest fashions down in Sodom and talking about Mrs. Lot and why why why does she have it easy and I've got it hard and I'm over here in the back side of the desert and Amen. All because you made that choice and &gt;&gt; and the whole time I I just want you to I I I want to bring a clarity. The whole time Sarah Sarah's name had been changed too. proving that Sarah was a part of this message. Also &gt;&gt; remember what changed your name was under the seals. And he start and he said, "I'm not going to call you church any longer. I'm going to call you bride so you'll understand that who I'm talking about." And Abram, I'm not going to call you Abram any longer. I'm going to call you Abraham so you'll understand that you're a part of me and you've got a part of my name. and I'm going to place you positionally in the promise. &gt;&gt; Now Sarah, in all of her unbelief and all of her questions and all of her complexes and all of her I I'm a failure and I don't know how I can manifest the promise and look at my condition and I I I I just can't do it and Sarah should have or Abraham should have got someone else. God should have got someone else. We've we've went through that ourselves. And there all the sudden, amen, Abraham just gets a gets away to himself and gets under a shade tree in the evening time and he begins to just ponder and meditate upon the promises of God. And all of a sudden, he sees three men walking down the road. And Abraham immediately recognizes who it is. And he jumps on his feet and he runs and he tells, "Hey, prepare a prepare some meal and prepare a calf and get things ready." And he runs out there to Amen. to to those three men and he says, "My Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, he had the correct identification. My Lord, not three, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but he recognized omnipotence. He recognized this is Elohim. Amen. There was some inspiration within his heart. He recognized God had been made flesh. And now it's God [screaming] with dust on his clothes walking, amen, to his tent. &gt;&gt; And Abraham brings him in and says, "Let me get some water." And he washes their feet and and he begins to get the meal all ready, you know, and making preparations. And then all of a sudden, as the t as as as the story continues, we find that they're at a junction. This is when after 24 years of waiting for that promise and there they are in their old age. Amen. But there is Elohim. And the prophet of God says that was Elohim or that was the son of man. It was God that was made flesh. And he be to tell them I've come to visit you according to the time of life. And and there was Sarah in the tent behind him. And he begins to say, "Why, you know, uh uh I'm going to visit you." And Sarah begins to snick her up her sleeve a little bit and say, "Me, an old woman, have pleasure with my Lord, and how can I fulfill this?" And God, hallelujah, God at the junction performs the sign of the Messiah and discerns the thoughts and intents of Sarah's heart and says, "Why did Sarah laugh?" And Sarah comes out of that tent and says, "I didn't laugh." Said, "Oh, but you did laugh." Now, the prophet of God let us know that God would have killed her right there, but she was a part of Abraham. And he lets us know that God would have killed you and I because of our unbelief, but we're a part of [screaming] Christ. &gt;&gt; We're the ones that was in his mind before the foundation of the world. And we is dealing with us according to grace. &gt;&gt; Now, no one could take place take Sarah's place. So God had to be made flesh to deal with her unbelief, her complexes, her fears, her questions. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You see what did that? It was the sign of the Messiah, the word that was dealing with her heart. And he never called her by her old name. He called her by her new name. showing us that even when we feel like we're unworthy and we feel like we can't manifest this message and we're sitting in a message pew and we're hearing the promises preached and we know amen that God has has vindicated his omnipotence among us and yet God is still dealing with us according to the spirit of grace. It's the moving of the Holy Ghost that is discerning our hearts, letting us know no one is going to take your place. &gt;&gt; No one. You see, it was a declaration of what time it is. The time is now and it's bride time. Hallelujah. You see, it's omnipotence. It's it's the word that is discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is God coming with a with a two uh with his word that is sharper than a two-edged sword. And it's discerning. It's even dividing between soul and spirit. And the prophet of God says that's the gospel. The power of God. The word of God made manifest is the gospel. The gospel came to us not through word only but through power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost to demonstrate the power and make the gospel live. Now again I said last night amen that we have been introduced to the Messiah and it's not a certain man that is here as the Messiah. It's the Holy Spirit is the Messiah. Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing. See, he's here now just working in the flesh, getting the body ready for the rapturing grace. Believe it, friends. And the prophet of God would show us it it it doesn't take something great. What it takes is just the simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. It takes a humble heart dedicated to God to just to believe God to bring Jesus Christ unto a present tense. You see again, it's not by power, it's not by might. It's by my spirit saith God. I'll unfold this mystery and he will cry to it grace, grace with shoutings and cryings. That's what it is today. God's amazing grace to his people. How he takes the illiterate, the unlearned and shows that Jesus is the same. The Bible says that where the word of a king is, there is power. And who can say unto him, "What doest thou?" The prophet of God showed us that what we have today is the king's message. And then and then he would show us that he was in Sabino Canyon and and remember he had his hands up and and praying and all the sudden there was a king. There was a sword that struck his hand and and he's looking at that sword and and he said, "My eye is so beautiful and I've always been a little scared of a sword and and glad that I didn't live in those days." Amen. He's looking. He said, "You know, I I I know that a king has a sword." And all of the sudden a voice spoke back and said, "This is the king's sword and this is the third pull." Remember that. Amen. The third pull of the prophet's ministry. And then he would show us that the first two pulls was in preparation for the third pull. Amen. The the healing. Amen. And then the s the discernment h the the the sign that messianic sign discerning the heart was only in preparation for the word to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then we can see where that sword is. The sword is not in a sheath but the sword has been unshathed. And where is that sword at? It is in the mouth. The sword of God is the word of God that has been spoken this hour. And John was told in Revelation the 10th chapter, amen, the eth verse, you go to that angel and you take that book and you eat that book because you've got to prophesy again. I tell you, God has put a powerful word in our mouth. It's a word of prophecy. Amen. And we're not saying anything different than what a prophet has already said. We're saying it again. We're just saying it again. Speaking the word because where the word of a king is, there is power. And this is a sword that'll cut both going and coming. It's a sword that'll bring deliverance. It's a sword that'll heal. It's a sword that'll set the captives free. It's a sword of declaration of who is among us. It is the power of almighty God to deal with the people to let them know he still saves the lost. He still restores marriages. He still amen knows how to manifest his spirit of grace in every heart and every life and every boy or girl. You see, when it comes to this, this is so far beyond man. &gt;&gt; But this is up in the rim of the Lord's doing, [sighs] and it's marvelous in our sight. Let me just read Psalms 118 22- 24. The stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; You see, we will see it. This is the Lord's doing. And it is marvelous in our eyes. And Jesus said, "The world won't see me, but you'll see me. Because I live, you're going to live also. The world won't see me." The world, the cosmos, the world order, they're just continuing right on. And the world is falling apart. And it's getting worse and worse and worse. But here we are with a declaration that this is the Lord's doing. This message is the ministry of Zerubable that has turned our hearts to the headstone and is crying grace, grace. It's the presence of omnipotence. It is Christ the word coming among us. &gt;&gt; We see it. Our hearts are burning within us. We know it's our answer. Hallelujah. You see, it's the vindication. It's God manifesting his presence among us. And the Bible says that this is the day which the Lord hath made. Hallelujah. Let me just say it like this. in that in a day of gross darkness, in a day of gloom, in a day of weary, nervous tension, where the world is falling apart, governments don't have an answer, politicians are fighting and feuding, and no one's got an answer. Everything is in corruption. The world is getting worse and worse and worse. But here we are. This is the Lord's doing. God has made this day. He's made it for the weary. He's made it for the tired. Come into this Holy Ghost move. It'll comfort your heart. It'll give you rest. It'll give you a faith for the rapture. This is the Lord's doing. This is the Lord. This is the day the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. That word rejoice, it means to spin around under the influence of any violent emotion. To be glad, to be joyful, to rejoice. I just want to say this day that the Lord hath made his omnipotence has been declared among us and vindicated. It has brought forth a violent motion. It sets you free. It sets you free from darkness. It set you free from fear. It set you free from discouragement. It set you free from hopelessness. It has turned you around violently and give you a joy. [cheering] &gt;&gt; A joy because you see it &gt;&gt; because you know it's a deep calling to the deep and it's the answer to the thirst of your soul. Then it says be glad in it. That means to brighten up. &gt;&gt; It means to be gleome, &gt;&gt; cheer up. &gt;&gt; To make glad. That's what he did. He made us glad. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that the human heart was made to be happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. To turn the frown into a smile. Amen. to look at the situations of the trials that you're going through, but look at it gladly with a joy in your heart because you know all things work together for good to them who love God. And God's molding a character. He's molding a character that will reign with him in the millennium. &gt;&gt; And God is doing something great in your life in this age. God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; God remembers the promise. He's the one that decreed this day. I will visit you according to the time of life. Sarah, it's time to get out of that bad mood. &gt;&gt; It's time to have an understanding. Get out of that complex. Get out of that fear. Get away from that weary. That weary will give you cancer. That weary will destroy a home. But come back to the word of omnipotence and realize that God has made you a miracle in this day. We would have been like Sodom if not for God. &gt;&gt; Remember Sodom? Remember they were burnt up. Don't you remember Leosa? They've kicked Christ out of the age. They don't want his omnipotence and they're going to burn up. But before the burning, God comes down and vindicates his presence. Amen. To give you a faith for the change of your body. To let you see that there is no accident in God. But God has brought you out of law, denominational ages to bring you into the age of grace. So you can cry grace, grace to the headstone. Grace, grace to this message. Grace, grace to the living presence of him. &gt;&gt; You see, the bride of Christ has been awakened &gt;&gt; by a message to a realization and understanding of who you are &gt;&gt; and who is here. [sighs] &gt;&gt; And all the saints have longed to see what you see. Moses longed for this day. Remember, God made this day for you &gt;&gt; because we're in a dispensation of overcoming. &gt;&gt; You've got to have something to overcome by. And this is also the dispensation of adoption. &gt;&gt; Dispensation of adoption, dispensation of overcoming. Are you finding the connection? The land's yours. The position is yours. The inheritance is yours. Caleb, go take it. &gt;&gt; Where's the thorn? Get it out of the sheath. &gt;&gt; Quit just allowing the message of the hour just to collect dust. It's time to confess it. It's time to speak it. It's time to realize what age you're living in. It's time to realize that all heaven is backing you up. [cheering] You say, "Well, I'm scared. Scared to speak the message. What if I'll get out of order? What what if I'll say the wrong thing? The prophet of God says that he has sent God sent the message to know to let us know the house and winds and everything about it. &gt;&gt; So how can you go wrong taking the message of the hour &gt;&gt; and destroying the devil with it? &gt;&gt; You tell me. Mas, why would you be fearful to speak this message? That is why we be we be fearful to leave this message in a sheath when it's supposed to be in our mouth and we supposed to be confessing it, speaking it, standing upon it. God's vindicated this message and he didn't leave us just because William Brandham went away. He's still here. [screaming] &gt;&gt; If he if he backed it up once, he'll back it up twice. If he backed it up twice, he'll back it up 20 times. [applause] He still heals. He still saves. He still redeems. He still This is still the year of Jubilee. [cheering] What does that Jubilee mean for me? The captives can go back to their homes and take up residence where the squatter tried to say, "It's my land." The devil's a squatter, young people. The devil's saying the Holy Ghost ain't for you. He's a squatter. &gt;&gt; The devil's saying that you can't live this promise. I just want to let you know who you are. You're a Joshua generation that is fed up with just religion, fed up with just hearing quotes, but a Joshua generation that is stepping into the promised land and saying, "Where is that devil? For me in my house, we are overcomers. I'm coming into my adoption. I'm coming in to what God ordained for me. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I know the devil's trying to say it's for a future generation. Well, it's not for you now. It's for the future. Let me just tell you, you're not the church of tomorrow. You're the church of today. &gt;&gt; You say you don't know what you're talking about. I gave my heart and filled with the Holy Ghost at 12 years old. I know exactly what I'm talking about. I seen God answer my prayers when I was 12 years old, 13 years old, 14 years old. I know it's for this generation. &gt;&gt; I know it's for now. &gt;&gt; My wife would share her testimony. She was a young girl that was raised on a message pew, [panting] but there was no life in her church. They didn't believe in the power of God. And worldliness started creeping into her life and all kinds of things trying to pull her into the world. Church fusses, church feuds, all kinds of different ideas. in the church. Oh my. But one day, a 16-year-old young lady, she come to church and begin to listen to a preacher by the name of Wayne Lawson. And that young girl at 16 years old repented of her sins and God filled her with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Don't you tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. Don't you tell me that the day has passed me by. This is the day that God created. This is God's visitation of grace. It's for you. It's for the weary. It's for the weak. is for the oppressed. It's for those that the devil has said is not for you. Come back to the promised land, the message of the hour, and see omnipotence in action. [applause] See if God won't fill you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; See if God won't give you a refreshing of his presence. &gt;&gt; See if omnipotence is not here in 2025. &gt;&gt; Something has awakened us. Now I you forgive me but I'm I'm trying to let you know about this grace that is among us. &gt;&gt; Something has awakened us to something so supernatural &gt;&gt; that is so far beyond your humanity. &gt;&gt; It's awakened us to something that is unearly. It it it's not earthly. It's it's it's something that is beyond our human efforts. Now I'm talking about grace. I'm talking about what this message has introduced us to awakened us. I mean, a hand that has come down and shook us and said, "You got to see what hour you're living in. You got to you got to know the day in your message." And he began to take us to the opening of the word and show us whose presence we are in. And when the world is getting worse and yet we've got something that is arresting our hearts that is making us stronger. &gt;&gt; It's something so beyond &gt;&gt; laws and controls &gt;&gt; and regulations and dos and don'ts and governments. It is something more than just something that dictates human efforts. &gt;&gt; It's something more than what we can imagine. It's something more than what we can see. It's something more than our memory. &gt;&gt; It's something that that when the devil is hounding your memory and saying, "I know what you did and trying to bring up all the scars of the past." &gt;&gt; But I'm here to say that we have been awakened to something that is greater than your memory. is something that is h that is that is superhuman. &gt;&gt; It's supernatural. &gt;&gt; It's so far above our human intelligence &gt;&gt; that the human mind can't even fathom what has taken place in this age. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about faith and grace. &gt;&gt; You see something that we've been caught up into the realm of the Lord's thinking. You see, I I just read an article of how that some years back just they took AI. This we're talking about, I believe about seven or eight years ago. Think of what they can do now. &gt;&gt; But there was a man who had a motorcycle wreck and he become a quadriplegic and he had something wrong with his spinal cord and he couldn't walk. He couldn't move for a decade. Couldn't move. But science begin to tinker and begin to take AI and find out that you can take plates and you can put it on the human skull &gt;&gt; and where where that the nerves have been severed that it couldn't receive signal from the brain down to the rest of the body. &gt;&gt; Put on your spiritual thinking caps now &gt;&gt; that you couldn't move, you couldn't [screaming] walk, you you couldn't function. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want you to refer I want to now put it back to a son of God &gt;&gt; that something has severed us from headship. &gt;&gt; Something has severed us from the control tower that we couldn't walk in the power of God. We couldn't move in the power of God. We couldn't speak in the power of God. &gt;&gt; We were under denomination manmade creeds and dogmas and we can never manifest the power of God. But all the sudden, just like they're finding out in science that AI, they could take these plates and they could bypass the bruise, &gt;&gt; they could bypass the hurt. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It was a wreck that put that hurt in his life. &gt;&gt; And we've been in church wrecks. &gt;&gt; We've been in human failures. &gt;&gt; And we couldn't get beyond our hurts. We couldn't get beyond our humanity. But God [screaming] supernaturally said, "I'm going to bypass that hurt. &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with that memory. &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with that cancer." &gt;&gt; When they did that, they put those plates. They bypassed the Amen. They bypassed that hurt &gt;&gt; and now that man can walk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what science has done. And the prophet of God says, "I'm afraid that science will find God. Tinkering in God's laboratory will find God before the preacher does." &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to say that this message has come to heal the hurt, &gt;&gt; to fix the hurts. Hurts that man has put there, hurts that we ourselves have wrecked up, just wrecks everywhere. But [screaming] God says, "I'm going to fix the hurts." The prophet of God says, "We have been lifted up into the realm of the Lord's thinking." &gt;&gt; Your human mind, you can't fix anything. &gt;&gt; Your human mind remembers everything of your past. Your human mind remembers, Amen. all of the bitter words and all of the bitter disputes and amen false, Amen. false ideals of this message that has crippled you. I know I'm preaching to you, &gt;&gt; but God in 2025 says, "I'm going to remind my people that omnipotence is here, and I'm going to bypass the hurt, and they're going to be justified as if it never happened in the first place. &gt;&gt; I'm going to heal the bruised. I'm going to mend the brokenhearted. And I'm going to put them on their feet again. And they're going to begin to walk in the power of Almighty God. and I'm going to be able to look at a life and say, "There goes my spirit flowing freely." &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet of God says in the message of adoption. He says he's wanting to put his sons in their position that he can say, "There goes my spirit flowing freely. No [screaming] blockages in the body, no blown fuses in the body, just a body that says, I believe it. I believe it's for me. I believe I am placed here to manifest the promised word of the hour. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; But you got to have faith in grace. &gt;&gt; You got to see that you're a part of this promise. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "We're now sitting in his presence in heavenly places, being lifted up by the word. The word never come to beat you up. The word came to lift you up." &gt;&gt; You see, there's been a blending of dimensions. Amen. The prophet of God says that the lid of hell has been opened up and all hell 200,000,000 demons have been turned loose in this age. Blending of dimensions. [gasps] But he says when all hell has been emptied out, all heaven has come down. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God would let us know that when you feel like you're going to shout and something begins to just just just comes upon your nerves, upon your senses, and you just want to say hallelujah, he says what's happening is a angel just brushed into you. I didn't say it. A prophet let us in on the others the on in on the unseen realm &gt;&gt; and let us know that there's ministering spirits, angels sent from the presence of God to minister to the heirs of salvation to let you know healing's for you. Deliverance is for you. The rapture is for you. Joy is for you. Peace of mind is for [screaming] you. something that's radically turning your heart around to praise and worship and you're offering the sacrifices of praise under the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord &gt;&gt; because something is arresting your heart, fixing the heart and then giving you a faith that says it's by grace and grace alone. You see a blending of dimensions that you can see that almighty God has moved among us and vindicated his presence like no other time in the history of the world to empower you and I to believe that God is here to manifest every promise concerning you and I. Do you believe that &gt;&gt; he has come down to empower a bride? &gt;&gt; That every promise concerning you and I, he's here to make it good. &gt;&gt; You see, he's come into your flesh. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; It's the son of man coming into the flesh of the bride &gt;&gt; to anoint you. And this is an this anointing is the spirit of grace. And it's so far beyond your upups, so far beyond your humanity, so far beyond your past, so far beyond your book of remembrance that the prophet of God says that there has been an invisible union and your old book has been thrown into the sea of forgetfulness. God doesn't even remember it. &gt;&gt; You're not big enough. You [screaming] remember. And the devil is the accuser of the brethren. But what you've got to see is God is so big that he forgets you ever did sin. &gt;&gt; So every time the devil comes to you and says, "I know what you did." You just remind him it's in the sea of forgetfulness. God don't remember it and I don't even want to hear about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's grace &gt;&gt; because God's got something great for this bride. &gt;&gt; And the only way you're going to take take a body change is have a perfect faith in grace. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. You see, he's come to change how we think, &gt;&gt; how we view ourselves. &gt;&gt; The devil's telling you you're unholy. The devil's telling you you're no good. The devil's bringing up your old past, that book of remembrance. But God has come in this hour to change how you think about yourself. &gt;&gt; He's come to change how you're viewing your families and the situations that you're going through. Just like we heard this morning that there is Amen. Billy Paul, he's Amen. What what was it? 14 years old, I believe, and he's got smoking a cigarette. And the prophet of God didn't blow up. The prophet of God didn't say, "I'm not even worthy to be a prophet." And no, something changes the way we view life. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Got a 17-year-old girl playing that booglyw music that the prophet of God preached against and despised it and hated it with a passion and yet could stand there and say, "Be a friend to her. Love her." Cuz he knew the secret to victory. This message came not to just be quotes. &gt;&gt; This message came not to just say, "I've got the message of the hour." This message came as omnipotence. To have preeminence over your life, to have preeminence over your thinking, to have preeminence over your emotions, to have preeminence of how you even look at your failures. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you if news flash, you're going to be a human all the way to the body change. And the prophet says you're going to make mistakes. But the way that you live an overcoming life is you feed your soul [screaming] with the word. &gt;&gt; When that old nature tries to revive, that old black dog tries to revive, you got to die out to that thing daily. Put it under the blood daily. Put it under submission under your feet. Come on, bride of Jesus Christ. Come on, [screaming] mighty warriors. in the last day. Put that old thing under your feet and say, "Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. I despise my own nature. I despise my human senses. I live [screaming] by the word. &gt;&gt; What does he say about me?" &gt;&gt; Little boy goes, he's a country boy. Never seen a mirror before. Never seen himself in the mirror. But he goes and visits grandma in the city and he looks, he's just a little boy looking around, maybe trying to get into a little bit, I don't know, a little bit of mischievousness, trying to find something to do. And all of a sudden, there was a door that had been closed before. Now it's open. &gt;&gt; And there is something that he had not seen before. [panting and gasps] &gt;&gt; And he sees another little boy there. and he raises a hand to wave at that little boy and that little boy waves back. &gt;&gt; He takes a step toward that little boy and that little boy takes a step toward him. It's a mystery. &gt;&gt; He don't know what it's about. But as he gets closer to it, the shadow is becoming a positive. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Until he gets nose tonse, face to face, and the reality strikes his heart, that's me. Hallelujah. Mom and grandmother was watching what was going to take place. What took place was a realization of his identity. He turned to said, "Mama, that's me." Let me just say what a vindicated word has decreed over your life. [screaming] That's me. I'm an overcomer. I am invincible. The devil is defeated. The devil is under my feet. I am healed. I am rapture material. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a faith. It's a faith that has birthed in our heart and is growing into a perfect manifestation of a son and daughter of God. That everything that Adam lost in the garden has been restored. And we've got the abstract to the title deed. The abstract has went all [screaming] the way back search the lean and is decreed they've there is nothing to hold you. [screaming] There is nothing that can put you under bondage. There is no devil in hell that can try to say that's my possession &gt;&gt; because the blood of Jesus Christ has blown has broke the shackles of hell off of your life. You never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Now everything that Adam had in the Garden of Eden that was lost in the fall has been restored. But my question to you is, can you believe it? &gt;&gt; Can you believe in this grace that has put the book in your hand and then said, "Now put your faith into action." &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost, receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [gasps] Got a situation that's impossible, that believe for the impossible. &gt;&gt; Why cry, little bride? Speak and go for it. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; We've moved into a faith walk &gt;&gt; every day of your life. Monday to Sunday and repeat all over again. It's a faith walk. &gt;&gt; Walking in the promises of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As I believe I was said I said it last night that the rapture is just going to be a common everyday occurrence. &gt;&gt; But you're feeding upon the promises of God and the devil's trying to talk you out of it. And the devil's saying it's not for you. And you're saying it's for you. The devil's saying you're no good. But you're taking the blood and saying that I am I am his righteousness. I am his holiness. He has died for me once and for all. He has dealt with the sin question. I am as perfect as he is perfect because I am made perfect by one sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I have been washed by the blood of the lamb. And that word washed means loosed. loosed &gt;&gt; and you're walking and you're fighting. You're not in a picnic. &gt;&gt; You're in a battle. &gt;&gt; And the faster you realize that, the better you'll be &gt;&gt; to realize that you're not here to have it easy. &gt;&gt; You're here to cut up some devils. You are here to prove to the devil that you are not like Eve who hybrid the word by just doubting one promise that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I'm quoting now. She got hung up on one promise that Jesus Christ is Hebrews 13:8. Well, I just want to declare unto the devil that this bride knows [screaming] that the same Jesus that was in Moses, the same Jesus that was made flesh, the same Jesus that appeared to Paul through the pillar of fire is the same Jesus that had his picture taken with the prophet. And it's the same Jesus that is abiding in my flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. News flash. I believe [screaming] in grace. I believe that I've been made for this day. &gt;&gt; I believe there's no weapon in hell that can defeat me. &gt;&gt; I [screaming] believe in the power of omnipotence that is raining upon the throne of my heart [screaming] that says I believe the word. I believe it's for me. And you whack that devil. And if he doesn't move, whack him again. He doesn't move, whack him again. And whack him until he moves. [screaming] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; takes rugged faith, &gt;&gt; but this faith comes from a grace that knows it's your day &gt;&gt; and it's your hour and it's the season for it and all the backing of heaven is yours. &gt;&gt; This came to let us know that it's time to believe in the supernatural. &gt;&gt; It's time. The time has come to believe for the body change, &gt;&gt; to believe for the rapture. &gt;&gt; And the body change is as easy as walking in the promises of God. &gt;&gt; You see, we're a promised land people. Do I have enough a little bit more time? &gt;&gt; We're a promised land people &gt;&gt; and grace has prepared us to walk in the supernatural. And just as Joshua and Caleb came out of that promised land just drunk on the new wine, [laughter] they had so much fruit, so much evidence that everything that Moses said it was, it really is. &gt;&gt; They came back testifying why it's a good land and it's flowing with milk and honey. &gt;&gt; Why you've never tasted pomegranates like this in your life. They're car and you know what they're doing? They're carrying the evidence back to the people. &gt;&gt; They've got some healing &gt;&gt; and they're coming to a young man and says, "Here, here you're sick. Here's some evidence." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Goes to someone out that that's having a hard time and they're struggling and they're all weary and bowed over in the cares of life and they've got some evidence and said, "Here's some joy for you. &gt;&gt; Take that joy." And all of the sudden something just begins to bubble up in the soul. It's because they're feeding on the evidence of the promise. &gt;&gt; You see, you know what the ministry is to do is to take the omni is to take the vindicated presence of omnipotence and bring it into the lives of the people and say, "Here's the evidence. Heaven is real. Angels are real. Jesus is real. It's finished. It's the finished work of Calvary. You can profess anything in [screaming] the word. It's yours. Quit your struggling. Just set your wings of faith and fly in the promises of God. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the age I believe we're in. The season that we move beyond the critical spirits. &gt;&gt; You say, "Now, Brother Jonathan, I know what I see. I know what I hear. I'm not looking at it. I told you we're in a special season and this is a season of grace. I believe 2025 I believe that this message is so real and so moving of the power in this Joshua generation that I believe that we are not looking at the critics. We're not looking at scoffers. We're not looking amen at all the naysayers. I believe that we realize that this is our season. This is our time, amen, to go possess Hebrin. This is the time for the body change. This is the time for the resurrection of the dead. This is the time where every promise of God is yay and amen. And we have heard the absolute of the word. Proclaim omnipotence is here to make good your faith. &gt;&gt; I believe it's for you. I believe it's the season we're in. I believe that God made this day for this for this season. &gt;&gt; The time of saying, "I wish I could and I hope I could and one day I will and it's over. &gt;&gt; Our view's been changed. There's an anointing upon our life. God's doing the work. God is manifesting his promise because we are a promised land people." &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan, how do I do it? You just walk into it as your inheritance. If I've got $20 right here and I said this is your inheritance. [laughter] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Now there is an example there too &gt;&gt; because the prophet of God says you got to be spontaneous [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; and when this word comes to you you got to get moved &gt;&gt; and the time for action is now &gt;&gt; well praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You move into it as your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You're still not moving. He was running. [applause] &gt;&gt; The move is on for the bride. [cheering] &gt;&gt; People have been pondering that. Oh, we don't need a Holy Ghost move. We don't need emotions. We don't need shouting. Let me tell you something. The Holy Ghost anoints our senses. &gt;&gt; But that's not even what I'm talking about. I believe in shouting. I believe in dancing. I believe in speaking in tongues. I believe in the gifts. I believe that the prophet of God put everything in perfect order. And I believe everything in our promised land is ours and it's yay and amen. It is proper order. But let me tell you what this Holy Ghost move is all about. It is the Holy Ghost anointing our faith to get into action and take a hold of the promises of God and say, "It's mine. It's mine. It's mine." To quit hesitating, to quit wondering, to quit questioning, to quit reasoning, to quit wondering. Is it really for me? Can I do it? The Holy Ghost is anointing this bride to get a hold of the promises of God and say, "This is my evidence. &gt;&gt; I'm feasting upon the good things of God." &gt;&gt; Well, it's the truth anyhow. &gt;&gt; It's a good land. &gt;&gt; It's flowing with milk and honey. It's the benefits of Calvary. It's the Holy Ghost. The blood has already been in the ground. The chemistry of the blood went into the ground 2,000 years ago. But what was in the [screaming] blood was the bloodshell, the life. &gt;&gt; And when the blood shell broke, [screaming] the move was on for the believer. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost be to bring evidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The denomination said, "Well, you can't believe for that. God don't perform miracles." Amen. The prophet of God came around and said, "We can't how are we going to have faith for a rapture when we can't even have faith for divine healing, &gt;&gt; faith for a headache, hardly." But how did he deal with that kind of a faith? He began to deal with that law, that spirit of denominationalism that was on the people that said they didn't have a right to believe in those things. &gt;&gt; He was liberating you to not only believe for a healing, but to believe for the greatest healing there is. That's the change of our bodies. &gt;&gt; Where did that come from? God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; And he began to back that message to let you know that this is not just a man, but this is a ministry of Jesus Christ in the last days to introduce us to the headstone. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; And that is the very power of God coming down to make every promise manifest in this bride body. &gt;&gt; What was it doing? It was releasing the very things that Satan through all of those denominational creeds and dogmas had bound up the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But a prophet came with a let me just say it like this. He came with a sledgehammer or we can just say he took a sword and he been be to whack away and chop a bride loose and break down those traditional barriers. And then the Holy Ghost begin to flow. What was the Holy Ghost flowing? The evidence of Calvary &gt;&gt; that healing still here, deliverance is still here. Joy is still here. Restoration is still here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Liberating the people to believe for all things &gt;&gt; to realize that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly. &gt;&gt; To realize that for our sakes, the wrath of God was poured up poured out upon Jesus Christ. The wrath that should have taken you out, instead it was poured out upon Jesus Christ, our perfect sacrifice that you could be free. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he who knew no sin became sin for us. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he bore our shame. The prophet of God would say it like this that he paid the debt of your high breeding &gt;&gt; in order that you could die to yourself until you're no more yourself and be filled with his word believing his word and then the Holy Spirit was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow. The prophet of God would say and Jesus the word took my place. He become me that a sinner that I might become him the word. Let me hold true to it not the church. The Bible says that we have a high priest &gt;&gt; that was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin. &gt;&gt; Tempted with everything that you're going through. Can you give me just five more minutes? &gt;&gt; Every struggle, &gt;&gt; every question, every temptation, every complex, all your fears, all your worries, that little hesitation, is he really talking to me? &gt;&gt; Like like our little sister, the money's there, the inheritance there, &gt;&gt; but can I really step out and take it? What if it's really not for me? I I'll be embarrassed. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says he was tempted in every like way. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're feeling. &gt;&gt; He knows your insecurities. He already felt it. He suffered everything. And the wrath of God came down upon him and broke his body. They took the cat of nine tails and they beat his back until his bones were showing. &gt;&gt; They mocked him. They plucked his beard out, ripped it out of his face. They spit in his face. Roman spit. Slime just coming off of his face. And he did it for you. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And then God in his mercy, when the devil thought that he had this little bride bound up, but God had already spoke a word and said, "I'm going to restore her &gt;&gt; and she's going to be word of my word. She's going to be flesh of my flesh. She's going to be spirit of my spirit. She's going to be everything that I am made flesh." And when God came down to make that covenant real to you and I, &gt;&gt; the covenant angel, and he began to show you the promises of God and that they're just as good as the very day that he spoke them &gt;&gt; and that there is nothing there is nothing against you. &gt;&gt; You didn't get saved certain day. You always were saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God sent a word to bring you to an understanding of who you are in Christ before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Why? The prophet of God said, we say we've got eternal day. You eternal life. You don't get get eternal life on a certain day. You are a part of him for all eternity. But you've only been made manifing time to express his attributes that you are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Then you've then you've got to step out and be spontaneous and say that's me. &gt;&gt; He died for this purpose. &gt;&gt; The word took my place that I can take his place. &gt;&gt; He become my sin. And he he took my he took he become unworthy. He became unholy. All of these things. He did it for me. Young people. He knows your passions. &gt;&gt; He knows your insecurities. He knows what it is to be pulled by the world. He knows what it is in Leosa. He felt the pressures. &gt;&gt; Why? We heard how that is 10 times harder than a hundred times harder. and that how how you're facing things that maybe mom and dad don't understand. But I'm here to tell you, you've got a merciful high priest that knows exactly what you're going through. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't understand it." Let me just say some things you just can't comprehend. You've got to believe what the Bible says. He was tempted in all points &gt;&gt; and yet without sin because it was God that broke a bloodshell in the womb of a virgin to manifest a perfect sacrifice to take her place. It's grace. &gt;&gt; And in this age when [screaming] John wept there was a message that said don't weep John for the light of the tribe of Judah prevailed. And he turned around to Zeion and he saw a lamb and a lamb that had been bloody and had prevailed because he was fighting over you. &gt;&gt; And he knew in the last days that the only way that you're going to overcome in this evening time is grace. &gt;&gt; The only way that you're going to become perfect in this age is grace. &gt;&gt; And it's not going to be sinless perfection in your own works. It's going to just simply be a perfect faith and a perfect blood. &gt;&gt; And as you believe in that blood, it's just lifting you higher and higher and higher. And it's molding you and it's shaping you and it's cutting a Christlike character in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for one purpose that we can come boldly &gt;&gt; without hesitation, without fear, without dread, without complexes. &gt;&gt; Just come boldly into the presence of our merciful high priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why are you coming? Because there's a need in your life. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Come boldly before the throne of grace." &gt;&gt; Well, who's on that throne of grace? It's omnipotence. &gt;&gt; It's Elohim. It's almighty God that has been revealed to us in this human element in this last days &gt;&gt; that we can come into his divine presence, his word, and say, "Lord Jesus, I'm struggling. I'm battling with some situations. Got a nervous spirit that's trying to take my joy. It's it's giving me anxiety. It's taking my peace away from me. I've got situations in my marriage that misunderstanding and it's breaking my home apart. You see, you're not meant to carry that burden. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; We're trying to be our own high priest. &gt;&gt; But it's our high priest that is our burden bearer. He's already carried your burdens. &gt;&gt; They're nailed at the [screaming] cross. And he becomes the offy to go into the hell. And then he went to hell to take the keys of death head on the grave. And he rose up victorious on the third day. He did it for your justification &gt;&gt; so you can believe. &gt;&gt; Come boldly and say, "God, I believe it's for me." &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "The problem of it is we've got so much fear and scare. Let the musicians come. &gt;&gt; We've got so much fear and scare." He says, "Now He says, "I'm I'm going to deal with that." He says, "You don't know who you are. You're not going to be a son of God. You already are a son of God. &gt;&gt; You didn't become seed at the altar. &gt;&gt; You're only hearing the shepherd's call &gt;&gt; and you're responding." &gt;&gt; And it's because you always worship. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's because you always were his possession. &gt;&gt; I I I tell you, we're in a season I I believe that there is I there's just such a season of grace upon us &gt;&gt; that there was such a deep calling into the deep &gt;&gt; that we're tired of just remembering evidences &gt;&gt; 65 years ago. We're tired of just looking at an inheritance and wondering if it's ours. And can we step out in faith and possess it? And maybe God just made us this way. Maybe he wants us to be this way. No. No. He wants you to be overcomers. &gt;&gt; And he's done everything in his power to give you a faith that his grace is here. &gt;&gt; It's grace. &gt;&gt; Grace to the headstone. He's here to minister to your heart, to minister to your life. &gt;&gt; He's here to make you white as snow. &gt;&gt; He's here to take the limits off. The prophet of God says that if you can just if you can just get past the sound barrier, &gt;&gt; he said we got to remove beyond that traditional barrier. He says, "If that plane could just break break free from its own sound barrier, then he says what we need to do is break free of our own sound barrier." You know what that that is? It's a reason. You know, the greatest tool that the devil's got is reason. Questioning, wondering, is it really for me? Can I really do it? a fear. But I I just want to say that I believe and you forgive me for being so bold, but I believe that there is such a special anointing of grace upon this bride in this season that if you can break free of your own sound barrier, well, I know what this one said and I know what this is happening and I know what's happening over here and that person there and that person Let's just break free of the sound barrier, our own sound barrier, and break past that old reasoning. I just say that if you need the Holy Ghost, this is your service. How many would agree with me? How many would agree from the front to the very back to even outside this building that if someone would want the Holy Ghost, this is their service? &gt;&gt; If someone is bound, I don't care the past. I don't care for how long. I really don't. I declare unto you there is a freedom in Christ Jesus and he's here. If we can recognize he's real and recognize that he's among us, why it's unlimited what God can do. Maybe you've got marriage situations, why it it looks like the devil's doing everything in his power to make it lead to a divorce. But I just want you to know that omnipotence is [music] here. I can't fix you. Your pastor can't fix you. But the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. And he knows how to fix the problem. I'll tell you what we need more than all of the counseling sessions there is in the world. I'll tell you what we need is a real Holy Ghost move. If mamas and daddies could just get into divine presence, situations will be healed. situations will be fixed. There will be humility take place. There will be apologies made. I was just over in another in another country and never been to the place before and it was very [music] spontaneous when I was invited there and I I I had just a little a little opening, a little slot to go and we made it happen. And as I was preaching that first service, a man came up and we prayed for him. And his testimony was I had made up my mind that this was my last service. I'd already thought it through. I'd already determined I was quitting God. I was quitting church. I wasn't coming back. I was going in the world. There had been situations that was that was in his life. But as he come and he began to hear the word, God had be to deal with his heart. And he come and he rededicated his life to Jesus Christ. And he went to his wife and made things right. And situations [music] that seemed impossible made him right. It was all because of the working of grace. Maybe you've come in this camp thinking that things are impossible. And and maybe they are. Let's just be quite honest. Maybe they are impossible. But with God, all things are possible. And if you can believe all things are possible with you as [music] well.

Why put it off for another situation? The prophet of God said, "The greatest the greatest debt is looking at the glare of another day. looking at the past [music] and only hoping that God could do it for you today. Why don't we just go ahead and say he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And what he did last camp, he'll do again today. What he did for you 20 years ago, elders, he'll refill you again today. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. He fixed your marriage before. He'll do it again. He met you at your point of grace, at your point of need. It was grace that fixed you maybe five years ago or 10 years ago. He'll do it again. Is there anything hard for the for the Lord? So, as we're singing, why don't why don't you just come? If you need the Holy Ghost, why don't you just surrender your life and say, "God, fill me. I need you, Lord. Go ahead, brother.
