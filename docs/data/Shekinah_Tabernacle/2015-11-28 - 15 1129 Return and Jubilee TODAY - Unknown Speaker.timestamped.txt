[25:51] is going to bless us with a song Amen so
[25:54] you can have your seats
[25:56] Hallelujah in the presence of the Lord
[25:58] this morning
[26:13] amen praise the Lord God bless you all
[26:15] this
[26:16] morning and I
[26:22] just I had
[26:24] a rush of inspiration last night so amen
[26:29] um it
[26:30] actually the song that is about Hezekiah
[26:34] and usually when you go through
[26:37] situations if you write a song about it
[26:39] then it uh the song has a bit more
[26:41] meaning to it than just a song you'd
[26:43] sing and right um
[26:46] so the background to this little song
[26:49] just to to make it interesting for you
[26:51] um when we were going through the trial
[26:54] a couple months ago that what we spoke
[26:55] about
[26:56] here the Lord sent seems to sometimes
[26:59] just give you when you're going through
[27:00] these things he might give you a
[27:01] character in The Bible and say well just
[27:03] look what happened to him look what he
[27:04] did and look what happened to him and
[27:06] look at his outcome and if you do the
[27:07] same thing you'll have the same outcome
[27:10] so um in that situation that we went
[27:13] through with a with with the companies
[27:15] the the character that I got was
[27:18] Hezekiah and Hezekiah served the Lord
[27:20] and he he he served them with all his
[27:23] heart and he tore down the the idols and
[27:25] those things and then not long after
[27:27] that the enemy moved in you know you
[27:30] think he's doing everything right and
[27:31] then the enemy comes in
[27:35] and
[27:37] um there was a very strong enemy that
[27:39] came against some of the Assyrians and
[27:44] Hezekiah
[27:46] basically went to the Lord and sought
[27:48] the Lord and desired deliverance from
[27:51] the Lord in that situation but you see
[27:53] when the syrians came they not only
[27:56] attacked him but they attacked the
[27:57] people on the walls they said don't
[27:59] trust in Hezekiah what's he how's he
[28:01] going to deliver you he's just deceiving
[28:02] you you know sometimes in our lives we
[28:05] get tested on all angles you know and
[28:08] anyway I just I just was blessed by the
[28:11] story of Hezekiah and how that Hezekiah
[28:13] just trusted in the Lord and the Lord
[28:14] delivered Hezekiah so can you brother um
[28:17] amand I've got I put the song up on the
[28:20] um slide if you just typ in Hezekiah you
[28:23] should find
[28:24] it and I hope I get this one right cuz I
[28:27] only just really wrote it last night but
[28:30] I want to just read you out the words to
[28:32] it in light of that
[28:35] there once it comes up on this one I
[28:38] just want to read these out just to get
[28:40] the feeling of it um the Assyrians
[28:43] gathered around Hezekiah looked out over
[28:46] the walls and all he saw as far as the
[28:47] eye could see was a sea of men when The
[28:50] Messengers approached him he gave to
[28:51] them a ransom but they said you have no
[28:54] more strength for war your Council won't
[28:56] help you anymore and all your people on
[28:58] the walls hear what the great king
[29:00] says don't let Hezekiah deceive you and
[29:03] say God will deliver us this day just
[29:05] look at every place we've been every
[29:07] Kingdom we've fought has been trodden
[29:09] under our feet you will be the same as
[29:12] the railings came up from the Assyrians
[29:14] Hezekiah went down to his knees he
[29:16] raised his hands and bowed his head and
[29:18] said oh God today is a day of trouble oh
[29:21] God the child has come and there is no
[29:23] strength to bring forth but you're all
[29:25] my strength you're all my deliverance
[29:27] and I put my trust in you oh God Amen oh
[29:30] God I have learned that in every
[29:33] situation whatever I'm facing I put my
[29:35] trust in Jesus and he won't put me to
[29:38] shame go tell Hezekiah his prayer has
[29:41] been heard behold I send Isaiah with
[29:44] they thus saith the Lord and to the king
[29:46] of Assyria I say who is thou blasphemed
[29:49] against was it not to the Holy One of
[29:51] Israel you may have spoke to Hezekiah
[29:53] but he put his trust in me the words you
[29:56] spake against him M ears they they have
[29:58] received but I'll hear no more the way
[30:00] you came is the way you'll go there
[30:02] won't be one Shield against the city
[30:04] there won't be one Arrow there will be
[30:07] no embankment made against it at all
[30:09] thus saith the Lord you will turn and
[30:10] you will go thus saith the Lord thus
[30:13] saith the Lord I have learned that in
[30:15] every situation whatever I'm facing I
[30:18] put my trust in Jesus and he won't put
[30:20] me to

[30:31] [Music]
[30:36] going the Assyrians gathered
[30:39] round Hezekiah looked out over the walls
[30:44] and all he saw as far as the eye could
[30:47] see was a sea of
[30:49] men when The Messengers approached

[51:48] amen God bless you amen it's good to see
[51:51] everyone out this morning uh just before
[51:54] we just before you take your Bibles um
[51:57] I don't know if everyone realizes but we
[51:59] have a printer in the front room and a
[52:01] lot of the lot of the sermons of brother
[52:04] baram are not actually printed by voice
[52:06] of God the vast majority have never been
[52:09] in print but we can print them so I know
[52:11] everyone has a tablet or a mobile phone
[52:13] they can read it electronically but if
[52:15] there's a if there's a sermon you want
[52:17] to read you know print it out we can do
[52:19] it for you here we have everything
[52:22] available so so I printed off some your
[52:24] testimony Jesus Christ 53 lamb and 56
[52:27] and healing what cancer is in 53 I don't
[52:29] know if these have ever been in print
[52:31] before maybe they have I don't know but
[52:33] they're all available so just thought i'
[52:36] let you know remember there's the uh
[52:37] books there uh in the room and we're
[52:40] replenishing them as you take them but
[52:42] but that's only 62 to 65 are printed
[52:45] there you know so there's many other
[52:46] years are not printed so if you wish to
[52:49] uh yeah if you want any sermon title or
[52:51] I want to know about some topic we can
[52:53] find it in this message and print the
[52:55] sermons off for you if you like them in
[52:57] that
[52:58] form amen let's um let's go to Leviticus
[53:01] chapter
[53:03] 25 and I just want to
[53:06] um I I I heard a I heard a service of of
[53:10] of brother
[53:11] Brandon this week and it really
[53:14] uh uh really I'd say
[53:17] uh really spoke to
[53:20] me as most of them do but this one
[53:23] really just jumped out and I want to uh
[53:26] let just read some scripture here before
[53:27] we actually um before I go into it so so
[53:30] Leviticus we're just going to read three
[53:31] three verses Leviticus 25: 8 to 8 to
[53:35] 10 and he says here and thou shalt
[53:38] number seven sabbaths of years unto thee
[53:41] seven times seven years and the space of
[53:44] the seven sabbaths of years shall be
[53:47] unto thee 49
[53:49] years then Thou shalt cause the trumpet
[53:52] of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day
[53:54] of the seven month seventh month in the
[53:56] day of atonement shall he make the
[53:59] trumpet sound throughout all your land
[54:01] and ye shall H hallow the 50th year and
[54:05] Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[54:07] and to all the inhabitants thereof it
[54:09] shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall
[54:12] return every man unto his possession and
[54:16] ye shall return every man unto his
[54:19] family amen may the Lord bless his word
[54:21] you may you may be
[54:23] seated so
[54:26] you know we're living in a very
[54:28] significant time uh in in the world's
[54:31] history and you know um I don't
[54:34] really uh I don't really want to preach
[54:36] a sermon as such uh but I just trust
[54:39] that don't think I'm we off into
[54:41] something just just just just stay with
[54:43] me now I really pray that the word of
[54:47] God that we have received would mean a
[54:48] lot more to us than it ever has at this
[54:50] Vero I pray I pray this message that we
[54:52] have received means a lot more after
[54:55] this service to us
[54:57] now those that those that keep track of
[55:00] dates we understand that 50 years ago
[55:03] brother bam was preaching his you know
[55:05] one of his last series of services in
[55:07] shreport and then on the 12th of
[55:09] December was the last time he was ever
[55:12] preached the service and that was just
[55:13] in communion and he just gives a few
[55:15] comments and then after that's done then
[55:19] he you know you drives heads back to
[55:21] Jeffersonville he's in the accident and
[55:23] he's gone before Christmas so
[55:27] this this is significant because every
[55:29] 50 years is a
[55:31] jubilee and we are 50 years down the
[55:34] road from you know you know just in less
[55:37] than 2 weeks is the 12th of December
[55:40] it's 50 years and it's all
[55:42] done and this is
[55:44] important because I just want to go into
[55:46] these things because we must recognize
[55:49] Jesus said no man knows the
[55:51] day but then he in that same chapter of
[55:55] Matthew 24 he l and conditions when you
[55:57] see it like a days of Noah days of lot
[55:59] so shall it be you know he speaks of
[56:01] these things so there's Junctions
[56:04] there's very important Junctions in a in
[56:07] in a Church's walk or or in an age and
[56:11] we' have come to that Junction we've
[56:13] come to a time where things what we've
[56:16] enjoyed in the past you know we can't
[56:19] always have Sunday after Sunday
[56:21] Wednesday after Wednesday Thursday after
[56:23] Thursday and all and just have Christmas
[56:26] the next year have another Christmas and
[56:27] just life can't just go on it can't just
[56:31] continue on as it has you know it just
[56:34] can't we're at the end of all things and
[56:37] so we've come to a point
[56:39] where the world has changed and you and
[56:43] God God's word is still the same but how
[56:45] he's dealing what he's doing among
[56:47] people is very different to the seasons
[56:50] before and you can see that you know you
[56:53] could see you know the short few years
[56:56] that I've been a Believer and you just
[56:59] see the atmosphere in the
[57:01] conventions you know what we experience
[57:04] up in car Cary what we had in our little
[57:06] Camp what was there in Queen's
[57:08] birthday was not the same was a totally
[57:11] different atmosphere to what it has been
[57:13] in the past the same people were there
[57:15] well more people were there now than
[57:17] they were but the same people have been
[57:18] there the whole time they've all been
[57:20] Believers but there's there's a change
[57:23] there's a change in the atmosphere amen
[57:26] you feel a Divine love that was not
[57:30] there amen amen over all the people as
[57:33] it was in the time past so this is we
[57:36] have to be spiritually aware that
[57:38] there's a reason this is
[57:40] happening amen there's a there's a
[57:42] reason why these things are going on and
[57:45] so you know I don't want to get ahead of
[57:47] myself but brother bam tells a story and
[57:50] I and I'll go into he speaks of he
[57:52] speaks of you know ducks that migrate
[57:55] you know there in North America there
[57:56] from Louisiana they go up to Canada they
[57:58] laid their eggs and then the change and
[58:00] the change of the Season those ducks
[58:02] that have been born there never been off
[58:04] the pond but because the change of the
[58:06] season they begin to swarm and there's a
[58:08] head Drake raises up he begins to honk
[58:10] and then he flies off they all follow
[58:12] him straight to Louisiana so in the
[58:14] change of the Season there's a gathering
[58:17] he uses these simple stories but this is
[58:19] this is where we are there's a there's
[58:21] been a change in the season we're not
[58:23] we're not 50 years ago at the opening of
[58:25] the seals we've come 50 years down the
[58:27] road and so what happened 50 years ago
[58:31] happened for a reason in that season but
[58:34] now we're in a different season the word
[58:36] is still the same but it's he's revealed
[58:38] himself in a greater way and so as he's
[58:41] been walking with us Church it doesn't
[58:42] matter if we've been walking with him
[58:44] for 5 seconds or for 50 years I'm sure
[58:46] you can recognize things are
[58:49] changing because remember the sign of
[58:51] the end the Great sign of the end is not
[58:53] the world's Condition it's the bride's
[58:55] condition yes because when she knows
[58:57] what she is then the Rapture will go
[59:00] when she recognizes her true position in
[59:02] Christ then the Rapture is going to go
[59:05] so when you really want to see where you
[59:08] know we understand Israel is God's time
[59:11] piece they've been in the land first
[59:12] time in 2,000 odd years they've been a
[59:14] nation you know they've been like that
[59:16] since 1948 so that's the time piece but
[59:19] then our Redemption is linked with their
[59:21] Redemption and you can see that in the
[59:23] Book of Ruth where Ruth came to her
[59:25] position a moabitas who had no part of
[59:28] the promise of God became United with
[59:30] Boaz who was a Kinsman who was who was
[59:33] Christ and type and then she she
[59:36] received her Redemption and then that
[59:40] her her coming into her position of
[59:42] Union with Boaz was tied into Naomi
[59:44] being redeemed as
[59:46] well so our our Redemption and Israel's
[59:50] Redemption is linked and so
[59:54] now and and so what I'm saying is now
[59:57] Israel is waiting those 144,000 I
[1:00:00] believe they're there they're waiting
[1:00:02] for us to leave and when we leave
[1:00:05] they'll receive what we have and we
[1:00:08] understand that you know brother Tony
[1:00:09] Emma brought it out in the in the
[1:00:11] ministers meetings you know Ruth you
[1:00:14] know had the child had the child and
[1:00:16] then gave the child to Naomi so You' say
[1:00:19] an infant gospel was was given back to
[1:00:23] the elect Jews there you know so the
[1:00:26] same Christ that we have they receive it
[1:00:28] in a you say in an infant kind of way
[1:00:31] and then they and then in Revelations 11
[1:00:34] it's called two witnesses to Israel
[1:00:35] because they uh they they preach the
[1:00:38] same thing that we have that's why they
[1:00:40] called
[1:00:41] Witnesses and so the two our us coming
[1:00:44] to our position we have to come to our
[1:00:47] position and then once we are taken out
[1:00:49] of the way then they
[1:00:51] receive now there's an overlap time I
[1:00:53] don't know how exactly that all comes
[1:00:55] together but we're in that overlap time
[1:00:57] because Israel you know the you know the
[1:01:00] first the first Jewish leaders there of
[1:01:02] Israel they were secular but now they've
[1:01:05] become more religious you there's a
[1:01:06] national stirring up of the Jewish
[1:01:08] people why is that because they are
[1:01:11] getting prepared there's a ground swell
[1:01:14] come back to the
[1:01:15] word because they are getting ready
[1:01:18] they're being prepared to receive this
[1:01:20] same Jesus Christ that we know
[1:01:22] Hallelujah and so these things are
[1:01:24] linked together so
[1:01:27] we need to look at
[1:01:29] now we need to look at where we
[1:01:33] are and I trust at the end of the
[1:01:35] service you'll look at where we are very
[1:01:37] differently cuz I know probably most
[1:01:39] Sundays I say the rapture's on and we're
[1:01:41] living in the season of the resurrection
[1:01:43] and we are but where where are we in
[1:01:45] that season are we in the beginning or
[1:01:47] at the end of that season I and I trust
[1:01:50] you know we're at the end of that
[1:01:52] season so now he says so this is just
[1:01:54] brother bam he says and and when he this
[1:01:57] is part of his comments when he when he
[1:01:59] just speaks before the communion there
[1:02:00] and uh you know to on the last recorded
[1:02:03] you the last piece that God has that
[1:02:06] voice in the days of the voice of the
[1:02:08] seventh angel you know so that voice
[1:02:10] this last part of what's recorded he
[1:02:12] speaks this he says now there's one
[1:02:14] thing I'd want to say just before we
[1:02:16] start the communion is this that I
[1:02:19] believe that we' have seen enough in our
[1:02:21] day that we live in that we ought to
[1:02:23] really give every all of our being to
[1:02:26] God we should really serve God I believe
[1:02:28] he has blessed us with a direct answer
[1:02:30] to scripture and he has as brother Perry
[1:02:34] gave it a few moments ago that we're at
[1:02:36] that time we're not blind we
[1:02:38] see we see that we're here we've arrived
[1:02:42] and we also can look around and see that
[1:02:44] the way that the human mind is leaving
[1:02:46] the people that we can't stay too much
[1:02:48] longer we'd be in a complete insane
[1:02:51] institution the whole the whole world
[1:02:53] would be SE so at the end time now as
[1:02:57] brother Perry ended up there seeing
[1:02:59] these things are true see if they are
[1:03:01] true they're not myth they're not just
[1:03:04] something that we imagine there's
[1:03:06] something that's been directly given to
[1:03:08] us by the word of God and manifested
[1:03:10] publicly before us that we know we are
[1:03:15] here and we have no don't put that 50
[1:03:19] years ago bring that to today cuz we
[1:03:21] have a direct answer where the same God
[1:03:24] that was there is the same God that
[1:03:25] present and the same God that affected
[1:03:27] people and Drew them there has drawn us
[1:03:29] as well so we have the same one now
[1:03:33] brother brandom yeah because I was I was
[1:03:35] cuz a lot of people have made uh you
[1:03:37] know on the internet's 50 years since
[1:03:39] this and 50 years since that and I just
[1:03:41] kind of left it there but then when I
[1:03:43] heard when I heard the Ser sermon uh
[1:03:45] return and Jubilee this is the service I
[1:03:48] heard it really spoke to me and and
[1:03:51] that's where the opening text is from
[1:03:52] and and I'm going to speak from that
[1:03:53] sermon but you know 50 years so brother
[1:03:56] bham he he he spoke at the 50-year
[1:03:59] Jubilee that was in California 1956 he
[1:04:03] he spoke at the isua street Jubilee
[1:04:06] where they had the 50th year anniversary
[1:04:08] and then in 19 I believe it's 61 or 62
[1:04:12] where he
[1:04:13] spoke um see if I can find the
[1:04:16] date uh
[1:04:18] 62 1962 was the 50th year Jubilee of
[1:04:22] when the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:04:24] Louisiana and now he makes he makes
[1:04:28] something of this because he is he is
[1:04:32] looking at where the church is in its
[1:04:33] condition and he says so we've come 50
[1:04:37] years now remember every 50 years is a
[1:04:39] jubilee so there's a there's a season
[1:04:41] comes into being where the people can go
[1:04:43] free back to their inheritance or they
[1:04:45] can stay bound they have a choice
[1:04:47] there's a there's a specific season that
[1:04:49] comes remember the 49 sabbaths before
[1:04:52] the 50th there wasn't a jubilee trumpet
[1:04:55] and the people were bound and they were
[1:04:57] stuck in their way someone could go
[1:04:58] redeem them and pay and we'll come into
[1:05:00] that but they were they were stuck but
[1:05:02] then when the Jubilee trumpet sounded
[1:05:04] every man had to go free every born
[1:05:08] every born Israelite their god-given
[1:05:10] right was they had to go free and they
[1:05:13] had to go to their position they had to
[1:05:16] it was law and it was
[1:05:18] enforced so it wasn't just a suggestion
[1:05:20] now you may it's you must go free it was
[1:05:23] a law it was God's commandment and so he
[1:05:26] comes to this 50th year
[1:05:28] anniversary and he's seeing that the
[1:05:30] that the church has has has left its
[1:05:32] foundation the church has left its
[1:05:34] foundation from being led by the Holy
[1:05:36] Ghost and God living to now they formed
[1:05:39] an organization and they just turned it
[1:05:40] into a
[1:05:42] tradition and now he says this in the
[1:05:44] world falling apart in 63 he says this
[1:05:47] he says as long as it's a system it's a
[1:05:50] system the whole system's rotten and get
[1:05:52] away from the thing that's exactly what
[1:05:54] we've got to do before it ever comes
[1:05:56] back you might not believe that but this
[1:05:58] is taped listen as it was a few years
[1:06:01] from today if there is such and you'll
[1:06:03] know whether it's true or not one day
[1:06:05] when the evening lights are breaking
[1:06:07] it's too late then you'll say well that
[1:06:09] man could have been right but it's too
[1:06:11] late then just exactly what Jesus said
[1:06:13] when he come to the Earth he said God
[1:06:15] had sent them prophets down through the
[1:06:17] age every time their world system would
[1:06:20] fall apart their religious system said
[1:06:22] what did you do with him God sent the
[1:06:24] prophet and put him in a tomb that's
[1:06:26] exactly and then about another
[1:06:29] generation you wake up and realize that
[1:06:32] that was a prophet and then what do you
[1:06:34] do you garnish the tomb what do you do
[1:06:37] make a tradition of his life you see
[1:06:41] the the the the Next Generation looks
[1:06:45] back because you say well how do you
[1:06:46] garnish a CH tomb today you make a
[1:06:48] tradition of his life you just make a
[1:06:50] tradition out of Christianity I bring it
[1:06:53] on home even more you just make a
[1:06:54] tradition and that is garnishing the
[1:06:57] tomb amen he said the Next Generation
[1:07:00] always does it and you can go you know
[1:07:02] Luther was there God was present the
[1:07:04] just shall lived by faith the people
[1:07:06] came out of the Catholic church and the
[1:07:07] light that was given and then and then
[1:07:09] Luther dies they turn it into a
[1:07:11] tradition and then some other people
[1:07:13] raise up and they come out and it's just
[1:07:15] a cycle all the way down through you see
[1:07:18] you see All Through the Ages God raises
[1:07:20] up people raises up men amen and they
[1:07:22] don't want to start a new church they
[1:07:24] want to fix the one they're in but
[1:07:26] because the church there in has made a
[1:07:29] tradition out of this is what we do and
[1:07:31] this is how we worship and this is what
[1:07:33] we believe then they have to leave it
[1:07:35] they don't want to they want to fix it
[1:07:37] but they have to leave it and then that
[1:07:39] person found something cuz they have to
[1:07:41] found a church for people to gather to
[1:07:43] and then he dies and they make a
[1:07:44] tradition out of his life and then the
[1:07:46] cycle continues to
[1:07:49] repeat friends we are people like they
[1:07:51] were people he say well we're the bride
[1:07:54] of Christ the ones that came out in that
[1:07:56] age with a bride of Christ too amen and
[1:07:59] where the people failed is they turned
[1:08:01] what they believed into a
[1:08:03] tradition amen if you turn this message
[1:08:07] into a tradition you've
[1:08:10] denominated amen because I can be a
[1:08:13] denom you see well this is non-
[1:08:14] denominational church you can be a
[1:08:16] denomination in
[1:08:18] yourself amen birds of a feather flock
[1:08:21] together that's right you see So
[1:08:23] eventually they'll all flock together
[1:08:24] now now with this church now we're free
[1:08:27] but if you've denominated in your heart
[1:08:29] you just put God In The Box put a full
[1:08:31] stop at the end and this is my
[1:08:32] experience and this is just how it is
[1:08:35] then you have done what they've
[1:08:37] done and we can turn we can turn coming
[1:08:40] here every Sunday into a tradition we
[1:08:43] can you know if if the Lord should car
[1:08:45] 10 years and we have a camp every year
[1:08:48] and we have watch Night Service every
[1:08:50] new year and maybe we'll have some other
[1:08:52] special meetings and we have a you know
[1:08:54] maybe you know our Queens birthday is
[1:08:55] our anniversary maybe if we had you know
[1:08:58] Lord willing when we go upstairs we have
[1:08:59] room to invite more people so we can get
[1:09:01] a guest speaker and you know these
[1:09:02] things that can turn into a tradition oh
[1:09:04] W Camp was wonderful I'm looking forward
[1:09:06] to the next oh that was wonderful you
[1:09:08] know just it just turns into a tradition
[1:09:11] what are you doing this this long
[1:09:13] weekend well I go to Camp why we always
[1:09:15] go to camp on this long weekend it turns
[1:09:17] into a
[1:09:20] tradition
[1:09:22] amen and because we're 50 years down now
[1:09:25] I'm just painting the picture this way
[1:09:26] because this is what the church every 50
[1:09:28] years this is what this is what
[1:09:30] Pentecost sh did yeah had the prophet he
[1:09:32] standing there saying you got to get
[1:09:33] back he says return return to your
[1:09:35] jubile it's the time of Jubilee return
[1:09:37] to the Holy Ghost return to the true
[1:09:39] power of God return to what your
[1:09:41] forefathers had and then there's a
[1:09:44] brother there's an older brother there
[1:09:45] that was at isusa Street and he gave the
[1:09:48] testimony and there before you know you
[1:09:50] just go listen to that sermon 1962
[1:09:52] return in Jubilee and then this old
[1:09:54] brother gets up
[1:09:55] and you can hear him on
[1:09:57] tape and and before it's recorded he
[1:10:00] says to brother B off the microphone You
[1:10:02] Preach to zeusa Street exactly and then
[1:10:04] he gets up and you can hear it in his
[1:10:05] voice says we must return we must return
[1:10:08] this you know our movement has got into
[1:10:10] the what do he say the Machinery of men
[1:10:12] and you can you can almost hear the
[1:10:14] tears fall off his face he's burdened
[1:10:16] cuz he sees he sees what the prophet's
[1:10:18] talking about amen see here's a burden
[1:10:21] we must return cuz now is the season of
[1:10:23] Jubilee
[1:10:25] and friends you may think you you may be
[1:10:28] free I'm not saying we're all you know
[1:10:32] what I'm saying is we're in a season of
[1:10:34] Jubilee we're in a season where every
[1:10:36] Blood Bought son and daughter of God has
[1:10:39] a right to return to their inheritance
[1:10:41] we're in that season this is a season of
[1:10:43] Jubilee where we have a right you say
[1:10:45] well I don't know what my inheritance is
[1:10:48] look and look into the inheritance look
[1:10:52] what into what belongs to you amen
[1:10:55] because I believe we should never
[1:10:56] Plateau on our experience with God don't
[1:10:59] get comfortable in your walk say Lord I
[1:11:01] want more of you even Paul said I want
[1:11:03] to apprehend that which has apprehended
[1:11:06] me that's what the messenger said of the
[1:11:08] first church age how much more now us
[1:11:10] down at the end of all things where we
[1:11:12] believe that in a twinkling of an eye
[1:11:15] we're going to step into a next
[1:11:16] Dimension into a new body
[1:11:19] hallelujah amen doesn't mean you have to
[1:11:21] get saved all over again I'm not talking
[1:11:22] about that at all I say don't plateau
[1:11:25] don't be satisfied amen say Lord I want
[1:11:28] more of you because there's more of God
[1:11:31] always to have ien you say well I think
[1:11:34] I know it all when you know it all
[1:11:36] there's one thing you should know you're
[1:11:37] wrong that's what the prophet taught us
[1:11:39] if you think well I've got all the
[1:11:41] doctrine sorted out I know how the Bible
[1:11:42] fits together you're wrong cuz this is
[1:11:45] an eternal word amen it's it's not it's
[1:11:49] not just well I've read it once and now
[1:11:50] I know it all it's an eternal word so
[1:11:53] read it again you meditate God you're
[1:11:55] the author I want to talk to
[1:11:57] you amen we serve a living God Amen now
[1:12:02] it's got a Deuteronomy chapter 6 I just
[1:12:04] want to read a few
[1:12:08] things you know I don't know if I have
[1:12:10] the quote here but but in that service
[1:12:13] because they were under great
[1:12:14] persecution there in Louisiana when the
[1:12:16] when the Holy Ghost fell and people ran
[1:12:19] them from all kinds of places they said
[1:12:21] they're having a meeting in one place
[1:12:23] people are shooting through the windows
[1:12:25] trying to kill them he said there was an
[1:12:27] old sister on the floor and the Holy
[1:12:28] Ghost praising God she got hit by a
[1:12:30] bullet it just fell off her dress like
[1:12:32] nothing happened amen that's right amen
[1:12:35] that same God Amen see that's the
[1:12:38] problem we have we are actually cursed
[1:12:41] with too much that's right we are cursed
[1:12:43] in this country with too much you say
[1:12:45] it's first world yeah sure but we're
[1:12:47] cursed it's a curse that's right and
[1:12:49] I'll show you this here Deuteronomy
[1:12:51] chapter 6
[1:12:56] and I could say this even
[1:12:58] too we can access any Ministry want we
[1:13:01] want we can find the best preachers in
[1:13:03] this message and we can listen to it day
[1:13:05] after
[1:13:07] day I now don't take me wrong but that
[1:13:10] can be a
[1:13:12] curse amen because you just sit there
[1:13:14] and you listen and you listen and you
[1:13:16] listen but where's the outworking
[1:13:18] where's the prayer we're seeking God for
[1:13:21] yourself you know brother Braham he said
[1:13:23] he said the Pentecostal Church chur are
[1:13:25] like modern day Hawks remember the eagle
[1:13:28] yeah we're called to be Eagles a hawk is
[1:13:29] built like an eagle but it can't fly it
[1:13:32] Can't Fly Like an Eagle and he said the
[1:13:34] modern day Hawks here in America they
[1:13:36] sit there on the telephone wires they
[1:13:38] wait for some roadkill and then they go
[1:13:40] and eat that they go and eat that off
[1:13:42] the road and he said they have lost
[1:13:43] their first estate they have fallen
[1:13:46] instead of hunting food for themselves
[1:13:48] they just wait there for something to
[1:13:49] die and then they go eat it that's right
[1:13:52] amen I know this may come across strong
[1:13:54] but that's what he said he said that
[1:13:56] that is what the church has has become
[1:13:59] Hallelujah now I believe in listening to
[1:14:01] Ministry if you take it in the right
[1:14:03] Spirit then you'll be spiritually
[1:14:05] blessed if you take it in the right
[1:14:06] spirit I believe it I do it myself amen
[1:14:10] but if that is all you do then you're
[1:14:13] just waiting for something that someone
[1:14:14] else has grabbed that's instead of
[1:14:16] seeking The unsearchable Riches of
[1:14:18] Christ
[1:14:19] yourself amen sure there's Ministry to
[1:14:21] break down the word and all these things
[1:14:22] but we're called this is not a Catholic
[1:14:24] Church
[1:14:25] Catholic Church is the priest has
[1:14:27] everything and then and then the priest
[1:14:29] dictates what he's going to tell the
[1:14:30] people this is not a Catholic Church I
[1:14:33] reject that in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:36] we're not called to just wait for the
[1:14:37] minister to tell us what we need to know
[1:14:39] we should and then when we've been
[1:14:41] reading it then he preaches it then God
[1:14:43] brings it together he say now I
[1:14:45] understand amen so that's what we need
[1:14:47] to
[1:14:48] do amen seek it out read
[1:14:52] it amen listen to it absorb it
[1:14:55] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:14:58] 6
[1:15:00] now sorry we'll start from verse
[1:15:04] three he says here therefore o Israel
[1:15:07] and observe to do it that it may be well
[1:15:10] with thee that ye may increase mightily
[1:15:12] as the Lord God of thy fathers has
[1:15:15] promised thee in the land that floweth
[1:15:17] with milk and honey hereo Israel the
[1:15:20] Lord our God is one Lord and thou shall
[1:15:22] love the Lord wait am I on the right
[1:15:24] chapter yep Deuteronomy 6 and thou shal
[1:15:28] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:15:29] with all thy soul with all thy might and
[1:15:32] these words which I commanded thee this
[1:15:34] day shall be in thine heart and thou
[1:15:36] shalt teach them diligently to unto thy
[1:15:39] children and thou shalt talk of them and
[1:15:41] thou when thou sest in thy house and
[1:15:44] when thou walst by the way and when thou

[1:15:50] tell what you know amen if all you know
[1:15:52] that you know God tell them about that
[1:15:54] amen tell them that you met Jesus Christ
[1:15:57] Hallelujah you that's you know that's
[1:15:59] right when thou rise up Thou shalt bind
[1:16:01] them for a sign upon thy hand and they
[1:16:03] shall be as frontless between thine eyes
[1:16:05] and thou shalt write them upon the posts
[1:16:07] of thy house and on thy Gates and it
[1:16:09] shall be when the Lord thy God uh Lord
[1:16:13] thy God shall have brought thee into the
[1:16:15] land which he swear unto thy fathers to
[1:16:18] Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to give thee
[1:16:20] great and goodly cities which thou
[1:16:22] buildest not and houses full of all good
[1:16:24] good things which thou fillest not and
[1:16:27] Wells digged which thou diggest not
[1:16:29] Vineyards and olive trees which thou
[1:16:31] plest not when thou shalt have eaten and
[1:16:34] be full then
[1:16:36] beware least thou forget the Lord which
[1:16:40] brought thee forth out of the land of
[1:16:42] Egypt from the house of bondage Thou
[1:16:46] shalt fear the lord thy God and serve
[1:16:48] him and thou shalt swear by his name so
[1:16:52] he's saying now he's saying because I in
[1:16:54] the wilderness they had to depend upon
[1:16:56] God all they had was manner that fell
[1:16:58] they they had nothing else they had the
[1:17:00] smitten Rock that's all they had but
[1:17:02] then now when they come into a place and
[1:17:04] he says there they didn't build the
[1:17:05] houses they didn't plant The Vineyards
[1:17:07] they just received it it was already
[1:17:08] there for them they just walked into
[1:17:10] their inheritance he says now beware
[1:17:13] that when life is easy you you forget
[1:17:17] God that's right and they'll say you
[1:17:19] know and then you can see in Malachi you
[1:17:22] know Malachi they say you know
[1:17:25] you know God is God is laying a you know
[1:17:27] complaint against Israel you know you
[1:17:29] say you you know you know you have
[1:17:32] robbed me he says you robed me in tithes
[1:17:34] and offerings and they would have said
[1:17:36] what do you mean we love we haven't
[1:17:38] robbed God we love God we're is you know
[1:17:41] you we're Israelite Believers yes but
[1:17:44] they they had they had forgotten amen
[1:17:47] because life got easy life got oh now
[1:17:51] the church is nice and now we have nice
[1:17:53] music and now we have nice singing and
[1:17:55] and now we have Sunday school all nice
[1:17:57] and the church lunches are all good and
[1:17:59] now Camp is all good and you know
[1:18:01] everything's nice but where Le th forget
[1:18:05] the Lord amen that when you have too
[1:18:09] much he saying when you have it all laid
[1:18:10] out beware least you forget the god that
[1:18:13] delivered you amen and that is exactly
[1:18:17] that is exactly now what what the
[1:18:19] prophet was telling the people there the
[1:18:22] 50th year Jubilee there of of Pentecost
[1:18:24] falling he says he didn't use the
[1:18:26] scripture he's basically saying the same
[1:18:28] thing you know you have left off you
[1:18:30] have got you have left your inheritance
[1:18:33] which is the Holy Ghost leading you and
[1:18:35] now you have a system set up you know
[1:18:38] that maybe appears good and to man's
[1:18:40] logic they like to have a hierarchy of
[1:18:42] men and they like things all documented
[1:18:45] and written up and all these things
[1:18:46] that's what men likes but if you if you
[1:18:49] lean that way and it's not God's
[1:18:52] provided way then you've left your
[1:18:54] Foundation you've left your inheritance
[1:18:56] and you're being led by man instead of
[1:18:59] God so
[1:19:01] now
[1:19:03] this and so he's calling the people back
[1:19:06] to their
[1:19:08] inheritance now remember we're 50 years
[1:19:10] down the road from from when the men you
[1:19:13] you when the messenger was here when the
[1:19:15] prophet messenger was here and you see
[1:19:17] the church now because we're a couple of
[1:19:19] generations down the road just like
[1:19:20] Israel was amen we the first the first
[1:19:24] generation they possessed the land they
[1:19:26] saw the power of God and there's only a
[1:19:28] few Generations down the road where it
[1:19:30] just became a
[1:19:32] tradition and they you know and we don't
[1:19:35] want to we don't want to be caught in
[1:19:38] that kind of
[1:19:39] cycle amen we don't want to be caught in
[1:19:42] that kind of cycle we understand that
[1:19:44] the cycle breaker has come Jesus Christ
[1:19:46] himself has come to break us out of that
[1:19:49] cycle of Revival and death he has done
[1:19:51] that but it's but man can still slip
[1:19:54] back back into that
[1:19:55] cycle it depends what you
[1:19:59] want now this is in uh return and
[1:20:02] Jubilee now we find out that so many of
[1:20:05] us in these last days in our organ
[1:20:07] organization of Pentecost that we have
[1:20:10] come in and organized ourself and
[1:20:12] rejected the leadership of the Holy
[1:20:13] Ghost by the wisdom of some groups of
[1:20:16] people instead of having Fellowship one
[1:20:18] with another it's divided us and
[1:20:21] separated us into several different
[1:20:23] organizations of people and in doing so
[1:20:26] it has broke up our
[1:20:28] inheritance now these walls inside if
[1:20:31] you ever get walled into a place where
[1:20:34] you can't accept the word and the Holy
[1:20:37] Spirit and have to take the Creeds and
[1:20:39] so forth of a church instead of the
[1:20:41] power of the Holy Spirit the Jubilee
[1:20:43] will never mean nothing to that person
[1:20:45] no matter how much uh you can say mother
[1:20:49] left uh uh you can say mother left you
[1:20:52] your inheritance daddy did that but you
[1:20:54] sold out and walled up and come into a
[1:20:56] Creed and accepted this Dogma that was
[1:20:59] injected into your fellowship instead of
[1:21:02] being free in Christ and getting and
[1:21:04] letting the Holy Spirit lead us along
[1:21:07] back in uh in the age when the early
[1:21:09] church was getting itself together
[1:21:11] immediately they had to go organizing
[1:21:13] and when they did because they were
[1:21:15] afraid now listen they were afraid that
[1:21:18] somebody else would a leader would get
[1:21:20] into a little group they had issues that
[1:21:22] come in and when they had to organize
[1:21:25] these issues and if they had just let it
[1:21:27] alone let the Holy Spirit weed out and
[1:21:30] bring out and lead in and put in the
[1:21:32] church would have been farther advanced
[1:21:34] than it is now in spiritual power yes
[1:21:37] now a man and his family could go back
[1:21:39] to their original inheritance if they
[1:21:41] could hear the Jubilee a trumpet sound
[1:21:44] and know that what what it meant to them
[1:21:48] now if they heard the priest sound the
[1:21:49] trumpet the minister the trumpet is the
[1:21:51] gospel and when they heard it and they
[1:21:54] know what it means and they know that
[1:21:56] that's their inheritance no matter where
[1:21:59] they've uh uh where they had lost how
[1:22:01] far uh they went back whever they had to
[1:22:03] do they had the privilege to come and
[1:22:06] receive again their inheritance the
[1:22:08] whole family would come and receive
[1:22:09] their inheritance and so it is tonight
[1:22:12] that men and women here of Louisiana
[1:22:15] that knows and I could say Stokes Valley
[1:22:17] or Wellington or wherever that knows the
[1:22:19] things that we that we do know and have
[1:22:23] heard from our brother of different ones
[1:22:24] of our Pentecostal experience years ago
[1:22:27] and we find that we have walled off we
[1:22:29] haven't walled ourselves away from it so
[1:22:32] far as we've got to hear that somebody
[1:22:34] says instead of what thus sayith the
[1:22:37] Lord is and we can hear that the word of
[1:22:40] God's got to say about it now is the
[1:22:43] hour of Jubilee so he so the prophet's
[1:22:46] making making an importance into this 50
[1:22:49] years now is the Year of Jubilee
[1:22:51] remember our Jubilee our Jubilee is not
[1:22:54] to be freed from Creeds and dogmas of
[1:22:56] man cuz we've been freed from that and
[1:22:58] we're in Christ but our true Jubilee is
[1:23:00] the change of this body am amen because
[1:23:03] our inheritance is in heaven behold I go
[1:23:06] to prepare a place for you and if I do
[1:23:09] I'll come again and receive you unto
[1:23:10] myself John 14 so our our true Jubilee
[1:23:14] is a change in this body amen it's not
[1:23:17] to be just freed from a church system
[1:23:19] and then walk with God it is it is that
[1:23:21] to walk with God but that's not the
[1:23:23] final part of our Jubilee our Jubilee is
[1:23:26] to go into a Rapture our Jubilee is the
[1:23:28] body change so that's what I'm saying is
[1:23:31] now is the season of Jubilee maybe just
[1:23:34] changed the whole emphasis a whole bit
[1:23:36] you know now is the season of the change
[1:23:38] of the body am amen we're 50 and it's
[1:23:41] we're 50 years down the road and to me
[1:23:44] it's not just that we're 50 years but
[1:23:46] you see as I said in the beginning you
[1:23:47] see how God is dealing and not just here
[1:23:49] but
[1:23:50] worldwide how things are changing among
[1:23:52] believers
[1:23:54] amen I've I've heard testimonies in
[1:23:56] Europe you know different camps split
[1:23:59] and all these things and they have a
[1:24:00] convention they get guest speakers in
[1:24:02] and then it's just like God just
[1:24:03] overshadows the whole thing and and and
[1:24:06] draws people together again and there's
[1:24:09] now love and harmony among people what's
[1:24:12] that God is doing something and there's
[1:24:14] a reason that he's doing it cuz now is
[1:24:17] the
[1:24:18] season amen I trust I trust it really SS
[1:24:21] you know now now is the season
[1:24:25] and so
[1:24:26] God the spiritual atmosphere is changing
[1:24:31] the spiritual at now this maybe I'm
[1:24:33] going too far out there but this is just
[1:24:34] my conviction the spiritual atmosphere
[1:24:37] worldwide is changing that's right amen
[1:24:40] it is changing because God is wanting to
[1:24:42] change he's wanting to cause us to go on
[1:24:46] the next step of the
[1:24:48] journey amen so the whole atmosphere is
[1:24:52] changing around the world among the
[1:24:53] bride
[1:24:56] and that is because you know he says
[1:24:58] this is an accepting God's provider way
[1:25:00] at the end time and this is where he is
[1:25:02] one of the places where he speaks about
[1:25:03] the story of of the ducks on the pond
[1:25:06] now I'm just going to read this to you
[1:25:07] because I want you to get it you say
[1:25:09] he's just talking about ducks on a pond
[1:25:11] no it's like Jesus he just say a parable
[1:25:14] you know there's like four you so winter
[1:25:16] so seed and he just lays out very simple
[1:25:19] oh that's just a children's story it is
[1:25:21] not a children's story it isn't one way
[1:25:23] that they can get it but there's great
[1:25:25] truth that are laid in those
[1:25:28] Parables amen oh the unjust judge and
[1:25:30] you know the prodal son oh that's just a
[1:25:33] isn't that a nice story it's more than a
[1:25:35] nice story Jesus Jesus speak God speaks
[1:25:39] in these ways because there's great
[1:25:41] layers of things in these stories even
[1:25:44] even things that happened in the
[1:25:45] prophet's life that he experienced
[1:25:47] there's great truths that are in those
[1:25:51] stories you know he speaks about you
[1:25:53] know like when he's lost on Hurricane
[1:25:55] Mountain you know the story where he
[1:25:56] goes he goes on the honeymoon with his
[1:25:59] with you know Assist leer and he's got
[1:26:00] Billy Paul there and there and they're
[1:26:02] up in a cabin or a lan to someplace they
[1:26:04] don't know the woods he goes hunting a
[1:26:06] blizzard comes in and he's got to get
[1:26:08] back to them cuz they can't even light a
[1:26:09] fire and then now he's lost in this
[1:26:13] blizzard now that speaks of that speaks
[1:26:16] of
[1:26:17] men that speaks of a person lost and he
[1:26:20] and he said he realized because he said
[1:26:21] I'll go this way and then and then he
[1:26:23] real realized and he came back in a full
[1:26:25] circle and then he realized that what he
[1:26:28] was getting into was called like an
[1:26:29] Indian death walk where people go around
[1:26:32] in circles and then they eventually die
[1:26:34] because they just can't take it
[1:26:36] anymore and that and that and that
[1:26:38] speaks of the human life where where
[1:26:41] people can just be lost unless God no
[1:26:44] man can come to unless the father draws
[1:26:46] him amen it's not it's not you making a
[1:26:49] decision God put something in you that
[1:26:51] can make the decision amen salvation is
[1:26:55] sovereignty is the sovereignty of God
[1:26:57] alone you know you know the church ruler
[1:26:59] said make a decision for Christ you can
[1:27:01] only make that decision of God is
[1:27:03] calling and all that come through our no
[1:27:05] wise cast out and so and so he's lost
[1:27:09] he's lost on this mountain and then he
[1:27:11] and he realizes that he's going around
[1:27:12] in a circle and people people can can
[1:27:15] experience the same thing in their life
[1:27:17] they go oh wasn't wasn't wasn't this
[1:27:19] sports game fun and this holiday was
[1:27:22] neat and now I've got a promotion now
[1:27:23] different job and now I've got family
[1:27:26] and wasn't this holiday nice and wasn't
[1:27:28] this movie neat and wasn't this and and
[1:27:30] they're just going around in a circle
[1:27:32] they're going around in a death walk
[1:27:34] without
[1:27:35] God but then he realized that there was
[1:27:38] a wire that had been put in that was
[1:27:41] running somewhere on that mountain from
[1:27:43] where he was to where his family was and
[1:27:46] then he
[1:27:47] prayed and then he even saw a break in
[1:27:50] the cloud and he saw the mountain and he
[1:27:53] says now I'll go this way cuz he thought
[1:27:54] he knew where he was going and then he
[1:27:56] felt a hand come on his shoulder cuz he
[1:27:59] was going in the opposite direction man
[1:28:02] thinks I'll serve God by doing this and
[1:28:04] they're going in the opposite direction
[1:28:07] amen and then so so he turned around and
[1:28:09] then he was walking he was walking
[1:28:11] basically nearly I think it was in the
[1:28:12] dark too I might be wrong and he was
[1:28:14] trying to find this wire and this
[1:28:15] blizzard in this Forest cuz he knew it
[1:28:18] was there somewhere and then so he had
[1:28:20] to walk along and then eventually he
[1:28:22] felt the wire I mean held on to that
[1:28:24] wire amen Christ found him yeah Christ
[1:28:27] found you there's a wire amen that
[1:28:30] you're that's hold not you're holding on
[1:28:31] to it but it HS on to you and you just
[1:28:34] hold walking holding that
[1:28:36] wire Hallelujah that's a Christian life
[1:28:41] amen without god without God turning him
[1:28:43] around he would have gone the opposite
[1:28:45] way and he's not he wasn't in a small
[1:28:47] place he could have walked for months in
[1:28:48] a certain direction yes amen that's
[1:28:52] right so this great he tells stories but
[1:28:54] there's great depth there's so many
[1:28:57] things in these stories so this is why
[1:28:59] this is why this he's he just he's just
[1:29:00] dropping things in amen now he says we
[1:29:03] know I was speaking about last night the
[1:29:05] gospel trumpet if it gives an uncertain
[1:29:09] sound uh um if it gives an uncertain
[1:29:12] sound his sound he doesn't give an
[1:29:14] uncertain sound now he's speaking about
[1:29:16] the Ducks they're real Ducks they know
[1:29:18] the sound of a duck what if you put an
[1:29:20] old Guinea out there or a turkey his
[1:29:22] honk wouldn't sound right
[1:29:24] they know the sound of a leader and the
[1:29:26] church ought to know it having a form of
[1:29:29] godliness denying the power thereof from
[1:29:31] such don't let them lead he high-m
[1:29:33] minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:29:35] lovers of God truce Breakers false
[1:29:37] accusers and continent despisers of
[1:29:39] those ducks that does fly see see what
[1:29:43] see what I mean they know what the
[1:29:45] gospel sound my sheep know my voice and
[1:29:48] a stranger they'll not follow God always
[1:29:50] proves it right notice and right they
[1:29:53] cannot you could not choose for them
[1:29:55] what if you went out there and said now
[1:29:57] wait a minute little ducks you're
[1:29:58] certainly wrong here's a big fine Drake
[1:30:01] my he looks he looks kingly among you
[1:30:03] and now you know what I'm going to do
[1:30:06] I'm going to pour a little water upon
[1:30:07] the top of his head and I'm going to
[1:30:10] inaugurate him and I'm going to make him
[1:30:11] King duck and I'm going to put a crown
[1:30:14] upon him and dress him a little
[1:30:15] different so you all will know him
[1:30:18] always follow this fellow here because
[1:30:21] he's
[1:30:22] cultured what does you say give a man an
[1:30:24] education in the scripture get him to
[1:30:27] dress a little bit differently let the
[1:30:29] organization put him in a in a position
[1:30:32] that's what he's saying amen a man-made
[1:30:35] leader now turn him loose on the pond he
[1:30:39] could hunk honk as much as he wanted to
[1:30:42] every duck would turn his back on him
[1:30:44] because he gives an uncertain sound yeah
[1:30:47] but let that little duck that's been
[1:30:49] chosen of God to be the leader let him
[1:30:51] honk and watch them all swarm to a REV
[1:30:54] where the carcasses the Eagles will be
[1:30:56] gathered he knows all about it see he
[1:30:58] has a provided way and the Ducks know
[1:31:01] the provided way too bad that man
[1:31:03] doesn't all right but that's the way it
[1:31:06] happens now all right if he is the
[1:31:08] inspired leader duck he'll bring them to
[1:31:10] God's provided place for them and if we'
[1:31:13] only listened to what the leader says
[1:31:15] the Holy Spirit he'll bring us right
[1:31:17] back to the word again that's God's
[1:31:19] provided way along the road we don't
[1:31:21] need Creeds and denominations and Wild
[1:31:23] weeds that's certain there's certain
[1:31:26] duck grass of stuff that we have to eat
[1:31:28] the Ducks down going down there's food
[1:31:32] um Heavenly bound creatures eat along
[1:31:35] the road and that is man shall not live
[1:31:37] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:31:38] precedes out of the mouth of God see
[1:31:40] that duck leader duck will lead them to
[1:31:42] God's provided place just as straight to
[1:31:45] Louisiana so leading leading to the rice
[1:31:48] so you say so you say well he's just
[1:31:50] talking about ducks no he's not he's
[1:31:52] saying he says another place he says is
[1:31:54] like a snow cap comes upon the mountains
[1:31:56] a cold wind begins to blow over the pond
[1:31:59] amen and spiritually in this world
[1:32:03] there's ice caps on every Hill and a
[1:32:05] cold wind is blowing over this Earth and
[1:32:09] when that takes place it's when the
[1:32:12] Ducks the Believers begin to swarm what
[1:32:15] happens when they swarm they begin to
[1:32:16] gather together and mean they begin to
[1:32:19] gather as one as one body CU they all
[1:32:22] recognize their ducks and me they all
[1:32:24] recognize they're true boo Believers and
[1:32:26] then the leader says now is the season
[1:32:29] and mean the Holy Ghost says now is the
[1:32:31] season you've been on this Pond long
[1:32:33] enough now you're going to return to
[1:32:35] where your parents came from now you're
[1:32:37] going to return to a place that you
[1:32:39] don't
[1:32:39] remember amen and this is and this is
[1:32:42] where we are amen the Holy Ghost is our
[1:32:45] leader and he's dictating to the bride
[1:32:47] around the world now is the season of
[1:32:49] Jubilee now is the season you're going
[1:32:51] to go back to your inheritance
[1:32:54] Hallelujah now is the season because the
[1:32:56] spiritual atmosphere is
[1:32:58] changing amen now I'm going to I'm going
[1:33:02] to turn a little bit but but I'm still
[1:33:04] talking about uh my thought here return
[1:33:06] in Jubilee today now the now the Jubilee
[1:33:09] as I said was a law and it's not a
[1:33:11] suggestion it was not a suggestion it
[1:33:13] was a law now God's God you the word of
[1:33:17] God is God's will how do you know the
[1:33:20] will of God for your life you know it in
[1:33:21] the word and this this is what he has
[1:33:25] declared so it's not this is not a
[1:33:28] suggestion this is his will being
[1:33:30] declared this worded his will and so
[1:33:32] he's not suggesting anything he's saying
[1:33:34] this is how it is this is what's going
[1:33:37] to
[1:33:38] happen and now that's why you can see
[1:33:41] you know Matthew 1:21 and she shall
[1:33:44] bring forth a son and thou shalt call
[1:33:46] his name Jesus for he shall save his
[1:33:50] people from their sins this is my will
[1:33:52] for the season I'm going to send my I'm
[1:33:54] going to I'm going to become flesh upon
[1:33:56] the Earth and he and I shall he shall
[1:33:59] save his people from their sin that that
[1:34:01] doesn't mean he might do it he will and
[1:34:04] if God if God purposes anything in his
[1:34:06] mind it's going to happen am no no no
[1:34:10] Humanity no power of man no religion can
[1:34:14] stop God doing what he wants to do amen
[1:34:17] you see the Prophet come in and when he
[1:34:20] you know you you know he says now the
[1:34:21] angel of the Lord is here at the end of
[1:34:23] the services he says now I take every
[1:34:25] Spirit under my control for the glory of
[1:34:27] God no Spirit raised up and was able to
[1:34:31] overcome what was going on in those
[1:34:33] meetings because he is saying now God
[1:34:35] has given him the authority to take
[1:34:37] every Spirit under under his control for
[1:34:40] the glory of God and that's exactly what
[1:34:42] happened amen because this was God's
[1:34:45] will I'm going to send Elijah upon the
[1:34:47] Earth he's going to call out a bride for
[1:34:49] me this this what he purposed friends
[1:34:52] what he purposed
[1:34:54] amen so so if he purposes something it's
[1:34:56] going to happen now turn with me to
[1:34:58] Ezekiel chapter
[1:35:02] 36 I want to read some scripture here
[1:35:04] and I want you to notice the amounts of
[1:35:07] times where God says I
[1:35:10] will I know I think brother Daniel
[1:35:13] brought this up on Queen's birthday but
[1:35:15] just in mentioning but I just want to I
[1:35:17] want I trust it really sinks home when
[1:35:20] God says I will he's going to do it God
[1:35:23] is Supreme you know you know in this day
[1:35:26] and age a man or a wife they choose
[1:35:28] their
[1:35:30] spouse but we God God is greater than
[1:35:33] that selection because he has chosen us
[1:35:37] and eventually we come easy or we come
[1:35:40] difficult but we're going to come amen
[1:35:42] cuz God's
[1:35:43] will Christianity is not our walk with
[1:35:47] God is Not democracy it's a Rel it's a
[1:35:49] love relationship but it's not democracy
[1:35:52] the church world doesn't dictate to God
[1:35:54] now God we want it different that's
[1:35:56] right that's not God has never operated
[1:35:58] God is a sovereign King he's the Supreme
[1:36:00] one over heavens and earth amen he's our
[1:36:03] Lord and he's our King and he dictates
[1:36:06] not not in a harsh way in a loving way
[1:36:08] but he dictates Amen to to his church to
[1:36:12] the world this is how it's going to be
[1:36:14] amen and then because we love him we say
[1:36:17] yes Lord because we don't want our own
[1:36:19] will we want his will to be done
[1:36:22] hallelujah now he says this let's go in
[1:36:25] in in verse 23 now notice the I Wills
[1:36:28] cuz this is you being spoken about in
[1:36:30] the scripture and I will sanctify my
[1:36:33] great name which was profaned among the
[1:36:35] Heathen which ye have profaned in the
[1:36:37] midst of them and the Heathen shall know
[1:36:39] that I am the Lord sayith the Lord God
[1:36:42] when I shall be Sanctified in you before
[1:36:44] their eyes for I will take you from
[1:36:47] among the Heathen and gather you out of
[1:36:48] all the countries and will bring you
[1:36:50] into your own land which is your
[1:36:51] position in Christ then will I sprinkle
[1:36:54] clean water upon you and you shall be
[1:36:56] clean from all your filthiness and from
[1:36:58] your Idols will I cleanse you and new
[1:37:01] heart also will I give you and a new
[1:37:03] spirit will I put within you and I will
[1:37:07] take away the Stony heart out of your
[1:37:08] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[1:37:11] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:37:14] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:37:17] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:37:19] them and ye shall dwell in the land that
[1:37:21] I gave to your fathers and ye shall be
[1:37:24] my people and I will be your God this
[1:37:28] what and this is your walk with God he
[1:37:30] says I'm going to do it hlah he yeah if
[1:37:33] he's decreed anything it's going to
[1:37:34] happen I don't yeah I don't have the
[1:37:37] language ability to put it in any other
[1:37:38] phrase but if he has spoken something
[1:37:41] thus is spoken thus it shall be and
[1:37:44] nothing upon this Earth can stop it
[1:37:46] there's no power in Hell there's no
[1:37:48] scheme of man we sing the song by trust
[1:37:49] it makes you it's more reality there's
[1:37:52] nothing upon the Earth
[1:37:54] doesn't matter if the whole world
[1:37:55] rallies against you that will come to
[1:37:58] nothing you see Israel how can it stand
[1:38:01] in that land how can it stand it's God
[1:38:04] God has allowed them to be a nation and
[1:38:06] I don't agree with everything that they
[1:38:08] do but God is ordained that the that
[1:38:10] they're on that piece of land they got
[1:38:12] hundreds of millions of hostile Muslims
[1:38:14] around them but yet they're a nation and
[1:38:16] yet they're prospering why cuz God said
[1:38:20] that's right when the Fig Tree puts
[1:38:22] forth its buds you know some is nigh so
[1:38:25] now they're planted back in their land
[1:38:26] and you see the nation of Israel
[1:38:28] blooming cuz God said this is going to
[1:38:33] happen hey he said it's going to happen
[1:38:35] it's there why are they there it's not
[1:38:37] their technology that that that allows
[1:38:39] them to survive God wants them there
[1:38:41] because there's 144,000 elected ones
[1:38:44] they going to receive the same Christ
[1:38:45] that we know they every one of them are
[1:38:48] going to be there am
[1:38:51] amen you see you know
[1:38:54] you had Tales of when they're fighting
[1:38:56] their war of independence in 1948 you
[1:38:58] know whatever eight time that was they
[1:39:00] you know most of their weapons were
[1:39:01] taken by the British and they had to
[1:39:03] fight fight these hostile you know Arab
[1:39:06] countries around there's testimonies of
[1:39:09] of people are going to be killed by the
[1:39:10] enemy and then Angels appear and all
[1:39:12] these different things and and the enemy
[1:39:14] flees why is that because that one God
[1:39:17] Spar that one's life or those On's lives
[1:39:19] for a certain purpose because out of
[1:39:22] them will probably come some of those
[1:39:24] elected ones amen you just go read about
[1:39:29] some of the supernatural testimonies
[1:39:30] that have kept those people and then
[1:39:33] we're here and we just
[1:39:37] think now let's just go let's go to
[1:39:39] Isaiah 49 I'm going to read a few more
[1:39:41] scriptures but I just I just want this
[1:39:44] to really sink in remember return and
[1:39:49] Jubilee Isaiah 49
[1:39:55] and we'll read from verse
[1:39:58] 13 now this is sometimes we think we're
[1:40:01] a destitute woman we're not amen I'm
[1:40:04] speaking spiritually as a as as the
[1:40:06] bride of Christ Isaiah
[1:40:09] 49:13 sing oh heavens and be joyful o
[1:40:12] Earth and Break Forth into singing oh
[1:40:14] Mountains for the Lord has comforted his
[1:40:17] people and will have mercy upon his
[1:40:20] afflicted but Zion said now Zion in the
[1:40:23] Bible is the bride okay the Zion Zion
[1:40:26] speaks Mount Zion Zion speaks of you
[1:40:29] Zion is the bride in the scripture I
[1:40:31] don't have time to go into it but but
[1:40:32] that's just how it is but Zion said the
[1:40:35] Lord hath forsaken me and my Lord hath
[1:40:37] forgotten me who's been in that
[1:40:41] position God's forsaken me he's
[1:40:43] forgotten me no can a woman forget her
[1:40:46] suckling child that she should not have
[1:40:49] compassion on the son of her womb yeah
[1:40:51] they may forget yet will I not forget
[1:40:55] thee behold I have Graven thee upon the
[1:40:58] palms of my hands thy walls are
[1:41:00] continually before me and that walls
[1:41:03] actually means a
[1:41:04] protection amen thy protection is
[1:41:06] continually before me what's that he's
[1:41:08] watching you he's watching your
[1:41:10] protection so sometimes we think that
[1:41:12] we're
[1:41:13] destitute I mean oh God's forsaken me no
[1:41:16] he hasn't because remember this is the
[1:41:18] bride's confession in a certain season
[1:41:20] the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has
[1:41:23] forgotten me Zion is the bride this is
[1:41:27] this is the bride's confession in a
[1:41:29] certain season but then said Lord says
[1:41:31] no can a woman forget her her son her
[1:41:35] suckling child she may forget and I
[1:41:38] don't see how that's possible forgetting
[1:41:40] child birth and having a child I don't
[1:41:42] know how people can forget that he said
[1:41:44] they may do that but I will never forget
[1:41:46] thee you're engraved on the palms of my
[1:41:50] hands amen God doesn't forget
[1:41:54] so now God's will he says in Ephesians 1
[1:41:58] and forgive me for all the reading he
[1:41:59] says in whom also we have obtained an
[1:42:02] inheritance being predestinated
[1:42:04] according to the purpose of him who
[1:42:06] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:42:09] his own will he works all things upon
[1:42:12] this Earth after the counsil of his own
[1:42:14] will he say well the world's so dark and
[1:42:17] all these evil things he worketh all
[1:42:19] things he allows things to happen after
[1:42:22] the council of his own will cuz he's
[1:42:24] decreed certain things
[1:42:28] amen so every every work everything upon
[1:42:32] this Earth is after his own will you may
[1:42:35] not understand it all things work
[1:42:36] together for good though that love God
[1:42:38] and a called and a called according to
[1:42:40] his purpose you may not understand how
[1:42:43] it works for the good but just rest this
[1:42:45] is for my good it's working towards an
[1:42:47] end which is for my good just don't
[1:42:50] forget that so it is his will
[1:42:54] remember he shall they shall call his
[1:42:56] name Jesus for he shall save his people
[1:42:59] from their sins so it is his will that
[1:43:01] his children go free it is his will that
[1:43:04] his children are delivered it is his
[1:43:06] will that you come to your rightful
[1:43:08] position in Christ that's his will amen
[1:43:10] amen that's what he wants that's what
[1:43:12] he's
[1:43:13] decreed and he says
[1:43:16] this he says this in John chapter 10 I'm
[1:43:19] sure these are familiar but I trust it
[1:43:21] means a bit more today then came the
[1:43:23] Jews round about him and said unto him
[1:43:25] how long does thou not um how long does
[1:43:27] thou make us to doubt but thou be the
[1:43:30] Christ tell us plainly Jesus answered
[1:43:32] them I told you and you believe not the
[1:43:34] works that I do in my father's name they
[1:43:36] bear witness of me but you believe not
[1:43:39] because you're not of my sheep as I said
[1:43:41] unto you my sheep hear my voice and I
[1:43:44] know them and they follow me and I give
[1:43:48] unto them eternal life and they shall
[1:43:50] never perish neither shall any man pluck
[1:43:52] them out of my hand my Father which gave
[1:43:55] them me is greater than all and no man
[1:43:58] is able to pluck them out of my father's
[1:44:01] hand amen no one
[1:44:04] see there's nothing that can take you
[1:44:07] out of the hands of God Amen and then he
[1:44:10] says in in John 6 as this is the
[1:44:13] Father's will which he sent me that of
[1:44:16] all which he hath given me I should lose
[1:44:18] nothing but should raise it up again at
[1:44:21] the last day and this is the will of him
[1:44:22] that sent me that everyone which seeth
[1:44:25] the son and Believe on him may have
[1:44:27] everlasting life and I'll raise him up
[1:44:29] at the last day so he's saying that I
[1:44:31] will lose nothing I will not lose a
[1:44:34] single son a single daughter I'm going
[1:44:36] to lose none of them that's what he's
[1:44:39] remember his will is supreme this is
[1:44:40] what he's declared he will lose nothing
[1:44:44] amen he's not going to just scrape
[1:44:46] through with 50% of his bride or 75% of
[1:44:48] his bride he'll lose no one amen no one
[1:44:51] that's elected amen me to be part of
[1:44:53] that number is going to be left behind
[1:44:56] amen we have that Assurance he says my
[1:44:58] Father which gave them is greater than
[1:45:00] all you know the biggest kid in school
[1:45:04] if he's bigger than everyone else no one
[1:45:05] can challenge that kid cuz he's bigger
[1:45:09] than all you understand nothing can
[1:45:12] challenge God and come off first place
[1:45:17] nothing
[1:45:18] can now there's return and
[1:45:20] Jubilee so we have a criteria
[1:45:24] now a return the definition of of of the
[1:45:29] return is to come or go back to a
[1:45:31] personal
[1:45:33] place and it's also an act of coming
[1:45:36] back to a place or activity this is what
[1:45:39] it means to return and then a jubilee is
[1:45:42] a year of emancipation and restoration
[1:45:44] which is kept every 50 years so he's
[1:45:47] saying this is a time to return back to
[1:45:48] a former place that you are in and it's
[1:45:52] a it's a time when all the captives Go
[1:45:54] free and there's a restoration which
[1:45:57] takes place so now there's a season
[1:46:01] remember I you know I I want to say
[1:46:03] those things you
[1:46:05] know you know I'll lose Jesus will lose
[1:46:08] nothing the one you know all that the
[1:46:10] father's given me shall come and all
[1:46:11] that come through no wise cast out you
[1:46:13] know all those things because I want to
[1:46:15] show you that this is God's will this is
[1:46:18] God's decree this is how it's going to
[1:46:20] be and so now if there's a rest
[1:46:22] restoration if there's a return in
[1:46:24] Jubilee there's two
[1:46:27] criteria there's two no wait I think
[1:46:29] I've got it here there's three there's
[1:46:31] three
[1:46:33] criteria only a true Israelite could go
[1:46:35] free in the Jubilee only a true
[1:46:38] Israelite remember they're Israelites by
[1:46:40] birth not by not by their their how good
[1:46:45] they are how intelligent they are where
[1:46:48] they are in society what they think of
[1:46:51] themselves their past
[1:46:54] that that doesn't come into the equation
[1:46:56] it's if they're a true Israelite by
[1:46:57] birth if they're true Israelite by
[1:47:00] seed then they have a right to go free
[1:47:03] in the
[1:47:04] Jubilee and then another criteria was as
[1:47:07] long as their inheritance now you read
[1:47:10] Leviticus 25 the whole thing we won't
[1:47:12] read it just save time but and then
[1:47:14] another criteria was as long as their
[1:47:16] inheritance was not in a walled
[1:47:20] City then it would be returned back to
[1:47:22] them
[1:47:23] now W City brother and says like world
[1:47:25] city is like a denomination things are
[1:47:27] Wen you got a year to to to get it back
[1:47:29] and if you don't well you've lost it and
[1:47:32] then but then the third thing was their
[1:47:35] inheritance had to be restored to them
[1:47:38] without question these are the things so
[1:47:41] without without question as long as they
[1:47:44] were Israelite by birth not an alien not
[1:47:48] someone pretending to be an Israelite
[1:47:49] but as long as they were an Israelite by
[1:47:51] birth they had a god given right that
[1:47:54] when that Jubilee trumpet sounded they
[1:47:56] could return back to what belonged to
[1:47:58] them
[1:48:00] amen and that's why Jesus said you know
[1:48:03] the servant doesn't abide in the house
[1:48:05] forever but the son abides ever so a
[1:48:08] servant who wasn't an Israelite they
[1:48:09] could hear the trumpet but they could
[1:48:11] never go free it was an Israelite by
[1:48:14] birth amen and that's why I can put such
[1:48:17] confidence in God's election because no
[1:48:20] one no man can come to me unless the
[1:48:22] father draws him amen so you can't come
[1:48:25] in your own some people do try and come
[1:48:27] cuz they think it sounds good but unless
[1:48:29] the father is not drawing you can never
[1:48:32] come amen you say well that's pretty
[1:48:36] strong that's what Jesus
[1:48:37] said those only those which the well how
[1:48:40] do you know how do you know the father's
[1:48:42] drawing cuz something in here says
[1:48:43] that's true something in here says
[1:48:45] that's me this is what I've been looking
[1:48:47] for my entire life that's the drawing
[1:48:49] when you come under the atmosphere of
[1:48:51] the word and then the father begins to
[1:48:52] draw cuz something in here says yes amen
[1:48:56] that's how you know the father's drawing
[1:48:58] and you're only and the reason you're
[1:48:59] being draw is cuz you're have an
[1:49:01] inheritance has been laid up for you
[1:49:03] because you're part of him amen remember
[1:49:06] the other other ones I could be a
[1:49:08] servant in Israel people will get
[1:49:10] excited when they hear the Jubilee
[1:49:11] trumpet it wouldn't mean anything to me
[1:49:15] because it's not for me it doesn't mean
[1:49:17] anything to me I'd hear the same sound I
[1:49:19] could watch them shout and rejoice but I
[1:49:21] could just but I you well I'm not an
[1:49:23] Israelite that doesn't apply to me
[1:49:25] there's nothing in here to respond
[1:49:27] that's that's what I've been looking for
[1:49:30] amen so it's very different now when the
[1:49:32] bride it doesn't matter what condition
[1:49:34] she's born in or where she's from or
[1:49:36] what background or past your background
[1:49:38] has nothing to do with it the the the
[1:49:41] trials of Life you've gone through
[1:49:42] that's irrelevant in God's election all
[1:49:45] that the father has given me will come
[1:49:48] and he said they will come they're going
[1:49:49] to come they must come amen hallelujah
[1:49:52] right amen I say God just draw us to
[1:49:55] yourself
[1:49:57] Hallelujah so now he so that is the law
[1:49:59] now if there an Israelite if they're
[1:50:01] part of the
[1:50:02] family amen if they're part of the
[1:50:05] family they have a
[1:50:07] right they have a right to what belongs
[1:50:09] to them and it's a law they must receive
[1:50:12] what belongs to them
[1:50:16] amen you can take that for whatever you
[1:50:18] want it to
[1:50:19] be a closer walk with God back baptism
[1:50:23] of the Holy Ghost to really know the
[1:50:25] author that that that sent the message
[1:50:26] and wrote this word I mean to walk with
[1:50:29] him like we're meant to walk with him
[1:50:31] that's our inheritance amen our families
[1:50:33] to be restored as our inheritance
[1:50:35] Abraham lot wasn't Abraham's son lot was
[1:50:39] Abraham's nephew but because he believed

[1:57:02] anymore right
[1:57:05] amen but some people they just love to
[1:57:08] be around you why is that cuz Christ is
[1:57:12] there
[1:57:13] amen go after your brother and sister
[1:57:17] you say well I've tried pray and go
[1:57:20] again say Lord lead me
[1:57:23] lead me to say the right thing you say
[1:57:25] well it's failed I tell you what for 49
[1:57:27] years they had no Jubilee that's right
[1:57:30] there it wasn't the right season but
[1:57:33] then there came a season of Jubilee yes
[1:57:35] amen where they had a god-given right
[1:57:38] that everyone had to return to their
[1:57:39] possession praise God Amen God is
[1:57:42] waiting upon you you're you're his hands
[1:57:45] and feet you're his hands and feet upon
[1:57:47] this earth oh Lord go speak to that
[1:57:49] person sometimes he just does it but the
[1:57:51] me times actually saying well what are
[1:57:53] you doing about
[1:57:54] it you go speak to them I don't know
[1:57:58] what to say just drop something
[1:58:00] in and then if you don't know what else
[1:58:02] to share because sometimes you you're
[1:58:04] there and you say you know you're in
[1:58:05] your heart son of man's being revealed
[1:58:08] we're in the season of the Resurrection
[1:58:09] you want you share these things cuz it's
[1:58:11] so glorious we're living in the season
[1:58:13] of The Rapture Hallelujah am and you how
[1:58:16] do I Lord how do I kind of boil that
[1:58:18] down to just start how do I
[1:58:20] begin tell them how your candle got lit
[1:58:23] tell them that this God is real Jesus
[1:58:26] has stepped out of History he's a real
[1:58:27] God today and he is yes amen because
[1:58:31] many times you know sometimes it's like
[1:58:34] it's like doing Mission work and you
[1:58:35] getting in these things 99% of the time
[1:58:38] I actually don't want to use the word
[1:58:40] Christian or
[1:58:41] missionary because people put you in
[1:58:43] this uh this box of this is and we're
[1:58:46] not that by God's grace amen amen so if
[1:58:50] you can tell them you you know you know
[1:58:52] it's like you said tell someone oh so so
[1:58:54] what happened Sunday I went to church
[1:58:56] and they put you in that box whatever
[1:58:58] they think it is but if you tell them
[1:59:01] you know you if the conversation opens
[1:59:03] God became real to me and this is what
[1:59:04] happened that's a totally different box
[1:59:07] and they have never experienced that
[1:59:10] amen it's a whole different way of think
[1:59:12] what and what does that do Faith cometh
[1:59:15] by hearing and hearing the word of God
[1:59:17] and a testimony to me is the word of God
[1:59:19] as well because it's this being lived
[1:59:21] out yes it's not just a theory anymore
[1:59:24] but it's a living
[1:59:26] reality
[1:59:27] Hallelujah go be a
[1:59:30] Kinsman amen that's what we're called to
[1:59:32] do was a god-given
[1:59:34] right because because he by Grace had
[1:59:38] inherited it no it won't be much longer
[1:59:40] and it um it would have been given to
[1:59:43] his fathers handed down year after year
[1:59:46] no matter what had taken place if he
[1:59:48] lost it it must go free it meant Grace
[1:59:51] is is uh it meant Grace is way provided
[1:59:55] for each individual Knight to return to
[1:59:57] their rightful inheritance what a
[1:59:59] picture it gives us tonight of the
[2:00:00] church in this last days we see what man
[2:00:03] can do then we see what God does What
[2:00:08] man does is failing and will fail and
[2:00:11] has failed and always will fail but what
[2:00:13] God does is eternal and must forever
[2:00:15] remain nothing can ever take it away God
[2:00:19] give it it's his free gift and by
[2:00:21] sovereign and foresight saw it and
[2:00:23] placed it and there's nothing can ever
[2:00:25] move it it's there eternally and at
[2:00:28] Jubilee was God's manner of expressing
[2:00:31] Grace To His People by restoring or be
[2:00:34] brought back to their rightful position
[2:00:36] now I believe that this is the hour
[2:00:39] again of
[2:00:40] Jubilee I believe it's the time of
[2:00:43] Jubilee I believe that 50 years ago in
[2:00:45] Lou in Louisiana this great state where
[2:00:48] the Pentecostal people are powerful and
[2:00:50] strong I believe that God set an
[2:00:53] operation a church See's saying I
[2:00:55] believe this is now the season of
[2:00:58] Jubilee and we are living in that season
[2:01:00] again
[2:01:01] friends amen I'm just I'm just going to
[2:01:03] close with this I just trust you Ponder
[2:01:06] you say this word this message has been
[2:01:08] sent is to set us free Amen to return us
[2:01:13] back to our original inheritance our
[2:01:14] position in Christ that's what the the
[2:01:17] message reveals Christ in here amen it's
[2:01:20] not another another testimony it's this
[2:01:23] testimony amen so we're living in a
[2:01:27] jubilee season take advantage of the
[2:01:29] Jubilee season because I believe in my
[2:01:32] own self there will not be another 50
[2:01:35] years I believe it's too far gone down
[2:01:38] the road take advantage of it you say

[2:01:48] knows you're busy if you're busy he

[2:02:00] redeem you know a cell phone is a great
[2:02:02] curse but it's also a great
[2:02:06] blessing or a computer whatever more cuz
