This is my Sunday [music] school class. We have a few teachers who have been teaching, but um they have been learning a lesson about walking with the Lord and they have a verse that they're going to say to you and I hope you'll be blessed after that. They'll sing a song [music] and it's just all about walking with the Lord. We got the inspiration from the camp. Thank you, pastor. And um our desire is to walk with the Lord.

Lily and Anelise. They say [music] sometimes [singing] [music] right now [music] [singing] I'm losing &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I've stood on [singing] this stage of nighten right now. [music] I just can't. It's [music] easy [singing] to sing when there's nothing to bring me down. What will I say [singing] when [music] I'm held to the flame like I am right now? I know you're able and [singing] I know you can [music] say through the fire with your mighty hand. But even if you don't, my hope [music and singing] is you alone. [music] They say to move [singing] a mountain, [music] a little [singing] faith is all I have right [singing] now. God, when you choose to leave mountains [singing and music] unable, [music] give me the [singing] strength to be able to sing. It is well with [singing and music] my soul. I know you're able [singing] and I know you [music] can save through the fire with your [singing] mighty head. [music] But even if you [singing] don't, my hope is you alone. my own sorrow and I know the hurt would all go away [singing] if you just say the word. But even if [singing] you don't, [music] my hope is [singing] you alone. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You've been faithful. You've been all my days. Jesus, I will you. [music] I know you're ready. [music] I know you can. I know you're able and I know you can stay through the fire with your mighty hand. But even if [music] you don't, my hope is you alone. Oh, I know the sorrow and [music] I know the hurt would all go away if you [music] just say the word. [singing] But even if [music] you don't, my hope is you alone. It is well with my soul. It is well. It is well. My [music] soul. song that I'm going to sing. I started writing it I think five months before camp and the goal was to have it ready and so be done and sing it by camp. But um you know when you songwriting I'm not a very good songwriter but um when you're songwriting you I personally you know I have a session set aside you know I'll pray pray for inspiration and um the words just come and um I only got like the first verse and the chorus and the bridge done over a course of two days and then just blank completely nothing. I couldn't get anything. And so it was sad like I couldn't finish it. But then about uh 3 weeks ago already in Australia, I was able to finish it. I had a session. I prayed. I said, "Lord, I really like to finish this song." And then the rest of the song came to me and I was able to finish it. So I just hope it's a blessing to you all. I see this one. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When I was [music] a child, you were in my heart. [music] You were my everything. You showed me a life where I wouldn't [singing] live without you by my side. You made miracles [music] which seemed impossible. Healing [singing] in the night. You, oh God, can do anything. [singing] [music] You, oh Lord, my God, are ruler of everything. Savior of my heart. We bow down before our king. [singing and music] You alone are worthy of all the praise. [music] We dedicate our lives to you, my everything. There were times that I wondered far from you. Still you called [singing] me home. You lifted up my head when I lost hope. You held my trembling heart. Put [music] peace into storms that rocked my boat. You surrounded me with your love. Faithful [singing] God, you've been my everything. [music] Oh, you are Lord my God, our ruler of everything. Savior of my heart. We bow out before our king. [music] You alone are worthy of all the praises. We dedicate our lives to you. My everything. You are holy. [singing] You are faithful. Every promise [music] you fulfill, you are mighty, ever present. Lord, I trust you and I will lift my hands in full surrender. Let your glory cover me for forever. You are worthy. Jesus, you're [music] my everything. You are holy. You are faithful. Every [music] promise you fulfill. You are mighty. Ever present. Lord, I trust you and I will lift my hands in full surrender. Let your glory cover me for forever. You are worthy. Jesus, [music] you're my everything. [singing] Oh, you, [music] oh Lord, my God, [singing] our ruler, live everything. Savior of my heart. We bow down before our king. You alone are worthy of all the [music] praises. We dedicate our lives to you my everything. [music] You alone [singing] are worthy of all the praises. We dedicate our lives to you. My everything. Amen. God bless you. Um then we have two testimonies. We'll start off with brother Paul I believe it and then uh then we'll have no God bless you saints. I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I I want to be on the same level with you not up there. So I try my best to be short as possible and normally a person like me, you don't give them a mic before the service. So I'm happy to see each one of you. Just a a it's not a quick testimony, but I'll try to compress it. Um we we we decided and we unfortunately left Shakina sadly and went to to P. But I thought I thought when we sat down with sister Christine and brother Ben for coffee and we were talking about this thing this thought I thought I knew everything and planned out but I didn't realize I didn't know. So I came here seven years ago with my family and we were led to be here in so many confirmations that the Lord led us to be here. We didn't know these people before just read them on internet and the testimonies that inspired us then the Lord opened the way. So fast track seven years later I I have this family uh that was so wonderful to me from from point number one the minute I arrived at the airport and you all know our our relationship and our history together right now but all the time when I came here I was concerned why I'm not getting the job which I was trained for which was more in finance budgets government. I'm a typical public servant if you know that's all I did all my life working in government seeing how politicians eat money or use it &gt;&gt; and helping them to do that or not to do that. So I was concerned and I spoke to brother Ben a few times why what is it that I must do and of course as a father I have to provide. So I had to get jobs and still in the government but more customer service and I felt some way that this is not taking me where I want to go career-wise and then man time went by I was starting to be comfortable ah that's the line I'll take maybe that's where the Lord wants me but I knew that I've invested so much in this direction of finance and I like it but I'm not getting there. Okay. Uh, citizenship came. We never thought about Australia. We've always had positive things, thoughts about Australia, but I never imagined myself there. Suddenly, I remembered before New Zealand and even our thoughts going to Canada came. Australia was featuring, but I've always perceived it differently. Now we got a citizenship and ah one day I said to my wife ah why don't you go to Australia maybe I'll go I'll get a job and then we started to be human and have thoughts [clears throat] oh we can do this oh we can we can money we can do that but we didn't realize that it's not about that it's actually not about money or my career my worry in other words my worry or my concern I don't want to be hard on myself but before the Lord was actually baseless because that that's the last thing that will worry the Lord. And why I'm saying that is because actually my father, he's not he's not limited to what he can give me, but he's got a bigger vision, a bigger plan, a bigger idea than what I think my ideas are. Spoke to Sister Christina and brother Ben and they said, "Ah, we're just having a friendly heart and you know when you just so comfortable with each other and say ah that way that way then eventually we landed with the idea of path I can I can without fear of contradiction called sister Christine she said hey me I didn't feel comfortable when I walked into that city of Sydney I said hey I said that's where the money is said I didn't I said ah sister maybe the Lord is leading you I'm not going to Sydney first take in quickly we we left I got a job my wife got a job first at a company and then I didn't get any not even an invite for an interview but later on I when she got a job she just spoke to this HR person who said h I see you guys are hiring me but my husband applied for a job there but you guys declined him said oh is that so said okay give me CV. Then she forwarded my CV. Few days later they called me. I said, "Ah, these people, what kind of people are these?" They called me for an interview. I went on teams online. 30 minutes later, they offered me a job same day and it never happened to me. I said, "Lord, is this you or not?" But that was not nothing to do with finance, still customer service. I went, you know, I left here and everything. The kids came later, joined my wife, started a job. And then before I left here, I received another call from a government department for a a finance position that was more entry level to build myself up. I got an an invite and I said to them, I'm not in town. You know, I'm out of town. What I meant was I'm not in P. and I didn't want to tell them that I don't live there yet. So I just said I'm not in town. Can I postpone the date knowing that I'm starting the other job so I'll be there? So they said okay fine. 16th October we agreed. I left yesterday a job 16th of October I went for that interview and I was working this other company with my wife doing customer call and customers and everything. So I went for that interview of finance analyst. Let's say it was and and just Please understand me. This is not about the job. It's about seeing God in what I'm trying to tell you. It's not really about I'm not trying to to be anything because I'm nothing. So let's say this is role at a position level X as the lowest. So I got an interview. I go I said man if I get this one I'll build myself up. Go for an interview. Interview as well. According to me, three people, senior manager, two other junior managers. I went two weeks later, they are not coming back to me. I found the agent who was doing recruitment. He says, "No, Samson, it looks positive. They will call you." Nothing. Third week, they don't call me. I called them. Then then I just received an email. deadline but she said positive but I'm deadline I've got an email I can show you deadline we will may call you in the next 12 months if there's any suitable job I thought it was positive I thought this is my entry level no I left started to be resilient and continue with the customer job and see what the Lord wants the same evening the manager who was in the interview called me and said Hey Samson, let's not talk about the interview and what happened. I want to offer you a job because I know you can do it. That got me thinking. You want to offer me a job? But I got a decline. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry. I'm going to offer you a contract. I'm going to offer you a contract for 6 months as if and then after that I'll fix up things. You can be appointed permanently or long term. I'm shocked. But I'm happy. So I talk to those guys where I'm working with my wife. Honey, sorry I'm leaving you. I negotiate in two weeks time leave. I start a job at the government department, local government. I say, okay, now let's see how this thing goes. I start I'm enjoying I'm starting to think back in South Africa when I used to do budgets in government. I can feel the government atmosphere. I'm feeling ah this is good. That's what I like. I I want to do so. So from here I must just grow. I tell brother Ben, man, I got a job. I'm studying as a finance analyst. He said, oh, but that guy did not offer me the finance analyst job at level X that I failed in the interview. He said, I'm offering this contract at the level Y. I thought I failed in interview. I'm offering at a level Y now going high or for me it meant extra money. So, I was excited. I'm a I'm human. So this guy said, "Ah, then I didn't question why you're offering me at higher level." I just grabbed it and I start went on work. First week, second week, he calls me out for coffee. We are drinking coffee. This is a guy who's got three uh he's a general manager. He's got about three levels going down before me or before that job that I failed in the interview. So then he calls me out for coffee. I'm building an organization. I want to build a team and everything. He said okay look there's a job that I advertise. I don't know if you saw it. I said no. He said go to the internet company website check and I want you to apply. I said mate I I don't have two weeks here. I found people working here now. I'm on contract. I thought you were busy arranging after 6 months. He said, "No, apply." I said, "Okay." He said, "Closing date is Monday the 1st and the interview is on the 8th." How can you tell me interview on the 8th when I have not even been called for? Okay, fine. I apply. I said to my wife, she said, "No, apply." I did a half-hazard quick application with a a a covering letter that was even lesser than the first junior position I applied. And then he he got the application before the interview. He called me to his office. He say, "Hey, Samson, you know, I'm I'm a very straightforward guy. I asked you to apply, but I'm disappointed. I'm highly disappointed in you because your covering letter is not what I I expected and I knew that he's speaking the truth." So I I was sad. I said, "I'm so sorry to let you down, but hey." Yeah, I did it in a rush because this pressure with budget time we are busy preparing for the budget. I said, "Ah, because I'm prepared to take that position he gave me. I'm happy at level Y, but the Lord is not finished with me to show me that it's not about a job or money or whatever. It's about his will and his plan about me and my family." And then I was called for an interview in towards the end of the following week for the Monday before we came here. And I went I prepared thoroughly because I knew I'm already on the back footing with my application letter. It all I was almost not called. So I went but I didn't give myself a chance because that's now level X. Are you following me? It's not level X. It's not normal level Y. I failed level X. I was given level Y. Now he's telling me to apply for level X which is now a manager. Then I go. I not tell you what I said in that interview. I spoke for 45 minutes. They give me a question paper to prepare first and present it. So I went, I finished. I went back to my desk. Continue working. As I I finished and I I I was coming out from buying food, I meet the agent, recruitment lady who was in the first one that I failed. She says to me, "Oh, I'm leaving now, but just before I go, by the way, can I contact those refere referees that you gave me in the position that you failed in level X?" I said, "Yeah, those are good people. One is in A&Z here in New Zealand. One is my manager back in South Africa." I said, "Yeah, I'll just refresh them to expect your call." He said, "Good." But I said, "Oh, but I thought you said two weeks. I'll hear." And he says, "No." She says, "The panel is done." I don't know what that does mean. I left. I went to eat my food. I don't know what to think. I said to my wife, "I don't know what I'm thinking." She says, "Okay." Then I get to my office. Then I grab my chair to my table, but I didn't realize I took my boss's chair by mistake. We were busy moving offices. He comes to me say hey Buddha this is my chair you took my mistake because I didn't mark my chair everybody marked their chair I say sorry boss he takes his chair then I go to the office to fetch another chair my one was not there so I see him coming towards me pushing a chair which was mine I swapped them he comes I say oh yeah and he comes closer to the office where I was trying to pick up a chair he says instead of giving me a chair he just closed the door and I I don't you know, he just says to me, "Congratulations." At that moment, I don't know what to think, what to say. What is he talking about? So, I say, "Hey, what are you saying, Bob?" He says, "Uh, no, that's all I'm saying. Just keep the information for yourself. Here's your chair." Then I check the chair, go to the desk. I don't know what to think, what to say. XY Z h how is that possible in two weeks on a contract? And I found people working there. Then the Lord said to me, "Hey, it's not about a job." What we worried in New Zealand or fin no seven years I take you there. I've got a plan, a purpose. Why? There's nothing about your job when what what is a job to me? The Lord says to give you. You think I failed you? So I was feeling that I've disappointed the Lord because he is got a kettle on a thousand hills. There's nothing. He can empty heaven to bless you. But he just want all these things that happens around us physically. He want us to see his glory. He want us to see him through all those things. It's not about that sickness or anything. It's not about that. So uh he said congratulations and I left and I'm waiting for an official document now. Maybe I'll express my happiness better. Maybe God helped me that I'm not doubting him. But all I'm trying to say, brothers and sisters, is that God is not limited to help us or to provide for us. Let's pray for impossible things. &gt;&gt; As the song was going, impossible things. We pray for those ones because he showed me that it's not about the job. &gt;&gt; It's not about a finance thing. He just wanted to show me just two weeks that he can promote me to be the head of that government department me even if there's better people. Why? Because you are a son of God. &gt;&gt; You have to realize that you are a son of God and God thinks way way better than how you think about yourself. &gt;&gt; And that's what God did for me and my wife and my boys. And they are I must say that I'm blessed. Kira, he just surprises me every day. Um even his volume went up. God bless you for that song, son. So that's all I wanted to share with you, brothers and sisters. It's about God. It's not about how I look, but he's got a plan for you. Which way must you go? Whom must you meet for what? He knows. &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's my one from camp. I didn't get it to tell it because we left the day after. I was kind of mad cuz I didn't get to tell it. Anyways, so um Sunday night. Yeah. after the preaching. So, it's like testimony, not my testimony, a prayer line that's going all around the church. And I had already got my fulfilling of the Holy Ghost 2024, right? So, there was nothing really for me to go up about. So, I was just praising in the audience. And then now in the audience, I'm just so sitting at the bro and we're just praising, dancing and then the line is almost finished and I keep on getting this pull to go to the front to get brave. I was like, what am I going to go for? There's nothing for me to there's nothing probable in my mind for me to go and say please pray for me. So I was just like, no. Five times it happened. Like literal almost push saying go up the front. I didn't know what I was going to say. So now on the fifth time it was only Andy and Brunin at the front and they were getting prayer and I was like okay go I'll go. And I going past Micah and I went up to the front. I was like I don't even know what I'm going to say. Okay, I'm going to Australia so I'll pray for that. And I said to brother Ben, I was like can you just pray for me because Before the service, I was kind of panicking and like overthinking because I don't know what's going to go on Australia. I don't know like it's a different place. I've never actually been there before. And then I was like, he just prayed for me that everything go well. So I didn't even know what's going on here, right? And then the words that he said to me, I felt it was straight from the Lord. That's why he wanted wanted me to go up there. He said, "Don't worry one about going to into uncharted waters because The more you put your trust in me, the more I'm going to lead you. The more that you close your eyes and just walk, that's the more that the Lord is going to take you. Because trusting in your own eyes and trusting in your own abilities to take you places, that's where now you're going to start falling and get hurt, come out with ages of scars. So trusting in the Lord and putting all your trust in him like completely, not worrying about anything that's going to happen to you, that's what's going to help you to get through on the other side correctly. Amen. God bless you. Amen. God bless you, Mo. Let's just stand and sing one more song before brother Ben comes this morning. Sing stay.

First and foremost we want to thank Almighty God for his grace, love and guidance throughout this journey. It is by his blessing that we are now united as a married couple. We would also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our families whose unwavering support and love have brought us this far. Your sacrifices and encouragement have meant the world to us.

Lastly, want to express our appreciation to every believer at Shikina Tabernacle and all who attended. Your presence and support made our day even more special. May God bless you all abundantly. So, God bless you all. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's um let's turn to the scripture uh this morning. We just go to go to Micah uh chapter 6 and verses uh seven and seven and 8. And I thought it was very um timely, Sister Tabitha, you know, you how you had the song in the Sunday school, walking with God, because that's what I'm going to talk about this morning, walking with God. So, I thought that was real nice and how all the rest of the songs all tied in with this. So, amen. So, we're just going to read this here, Micah 6 and and verses 6 through8. And it and it reads like So, we have lunch afterwards as well. So, don't run away. We're going to eat together afterwards. So, you're all all very welcome to stay. And Amen. I appreciate you all. So, it says here uh wherewith shall I come before the Lord and bow down myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with 10,000s of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath showed thee, oh man, what is good, and what do the Lord require of thee? but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. Amen. Let's commit our lives in our this time. If you have a need, just want to slip your hand up, say, "Lord, remember me." He's a personal God. Wherever you if you invite him, he'll come to you. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we just want more of you, Lord. We want more more of you, oh God. More of your presence, Lord. Pour yourself into us, Father. We lift our cups up, Lord. We lift every need, every burden, every question. Father, I pray you come and you cleanse us of our secret faults. May you be glorified in our midst. Lord, forgive us of our sins and our wrongs. Cover us in your blood, dear God. May you be glorified in our midst. Lord, we bow our heads and say, "Thank you, Lord. You do all things very well." So, Father, as we've read your word, I pray you'd speak to our hearts. Speak to my heart, too. Be at those who are streaming who couldn't be here today. Be their abundant portion. We think of the Stro family driving north. Keep them safe on the road. We love you, Lord. We thank you for this opportunity in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats this morning. So, I want to speak about walking with God. And if I could put another title uh Enoch's walk. Now, we understand that the uh scripture tells us in Genesis that uh and Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him. Now, Brother Bram says that God condenses his truth. So it'll be just a phrase, but God condenses a great truth in that phrase. And even this here where God would God would ask the question, you know, what does the Lord really want? And I think very I think it's very important, especially as we're going into 2026 as, you know, the world is falling apart, but yet God is pouring himself into his believer more and more. And God's moving in great power and he's making this, you know, making the message so tangible, so alive and so real that, you know, what is the way forward, you know, because there there's always a way forward. You know, God, God did not put us in this dark age just for us to stumble along and try and find our way. He always goes before us. Amen. And so, we have supreme confidence that God and his word has given us a path forward. And so, I believe this is [laughter] really the path forward is that because what does God want? Because you think about this. This is the God, the supreme Lord God Almighty who made heaven and earth. Amen. His spoken word has made this universe. The pew you sit on is his spoken word. God made your bodies. He made all things and he's higher than the heavens. He's so He's so holy and without sin that even the angels that never fell look dirty in his sight. This how supreme this God is. And he's asking the question now, how can we approach this great God? You think about how we don't we are not veiled by tradition this morning. We don't have some humanistic way of approach. But God God has actually demolished all that nonsense. Amen. That now we can we can we can walk with a pure faith, a pure revelation and we know how to approach the Lord. This is so to me it's so amazing. Lord, how can I come to where you are? Like there's a chorus we used to sing. You know, when I could not go to where he was, you came to me. Amen. And so if he came to me, he's going to reveal a path. How do I approach him now? And so he asked the question, um, you know, is it burnt offerings? Is that really what God wants? A bunch of, you know, I'm not against praise. I'm sure you all know me enough that I'm not some stiff, starchy white guy, okay? I'm a Christian. I've been born again. Amen. So I'm not some formalistic dead bit of stump somewhere. I've got life. I mean, he found me, saved me, and I'm just extremely happy with what he's doing in my life. So, I like to express that I've got a bit of emotion, right? Brother Bram said, "Anything without emotion, you bury it and let it be raised again in newness of life." So, so it's more than just a bunch of sacrifice and praise. He doesn't really want that. Even even as it says here, is he pleased with thousands of rams or tens of thousands of rivers of oil? You know, great emotional or inspired time. See, God wants to be more than just anoint our spirit or anoint our flesh. Though he does those things, but he wants to come abide in our souls. Amen. That's that's what he's looking for. And he says this is what this is the way you must good. You know, this is the way that is good. This is what God requires of you. &gt;&gt; I'm glad God answers his own question, right? He says to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God. Now, this is the key to a successful walk. I say this is the key to Enoch's walk. Amen. Now, Brother Bram says this in the message uh Satan's Eden. He says, "I wanted to speak to you something to bring something to enlighten to you the promise of God for this age. See, something not something that somebody else was in some other day, but something when them things are all right." And we all refer to those things. But I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I got written here that would enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now. To learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you. See, that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can. Now, who wants to be able to do that? Amen. That you see the enemy coming. You don't you we don't have to stand there and take blows. You know, it's not like I'm sure you've halfly seen these kind of videos where these guys they they they agree to do it. They stand or they sit in front of each other and one slaps one and then the other guy has a shot and you know who's seen that kind of stuff? Some someone's honest here. I've seen it. I thought that is the most stupid contest you could ever fathom in your mind. You know, why on earth would you do that? But for some reason, we kind of think that this is how the Christian walk is, is we we give the devil one and then he and then he then he gives us one and we just have to take it. No, we can walk in this world in such a way that we can keep those punches off us before they even land. Amen. And that's what the message has done. He's opened his word to us that we can realize now I see you enemy. I see you Satan. I see your tactics. I'm going to bypass this. I mean, there's some battles you've got to go through, but there's some battles we don't have to go through. You know, we walk by faith and not by sight. So, we can we can bypass his attacks if we want. Now, some of these things, you know, we think about, you know, so so what are the punches then that we're facing today? I think it's a good question. This is this is how my brain works. You talk about the punches off of you. Okay. Well, what kind of punches am I maybe going to maybe going to be hit by? You know, it's not well, for us anyway, the punches aren't drinking, drugs, or smoking to most of us. Those aren't the things that really can knock us down. We've risen above those things. Revelation has taken us above those things, right? It's not even It's not even denominational creeds or ideas of men. We, you know, a lot of us were born in Who was born in Okay, I wasn't, but who was born in the message? Raise your hand. So, you know nothing of coming out of some religious system. you were born out of it already, right? So those punches are not punches that you need to avoid because you've already moved beyond those things, right? So, so there's things like that. It's like those aren't the punches that the devil's going to try and knock. You know, I don't have to stand here and tell you what the mark of the beast is. And sure, I'll preach those things. I feel led, but we know what it is. We're not wrestling with is is the word right or is tradition right or you know, is the message right or is it wrong. We've God has given us a revelation that we know who is who he is and Jesus Christ is his word. So those kind of punches they should be under our feet. Right. Right. So so then what would what would they be? Well the most deceptive punches are these. This is just my list. Yeah. There's far more. Pride is a punch, &gt;&gt; right? A critical spirit that is backed up by quotes and scriptures. That's a terrible punch. Remember, these punches just affect you. They affect others, but they're really just beating you. We don't want a bunch of bruises by because of a critical spirit that's affecting our lives. Amen. Or making the circle smaller and smaller until eventually you're even out of it yourself. That's a punch. I'm not fellowshipping with those people, they're like this, or 10 years ago, they like that. They've grown. Have you grown? They've grown. Have they changed? You've changed. Have they got revelation? Yeah, you. Well, you have. God was gracious to you. You know, I'm sure he's been gracious to them, but so you cut them out of your circle. Your circle gets so small, you're like, "Well, I can't even live this myself." Well, you just been receiving punches for a long time. I think we should be able to wake up and say, "Hold on. This is the enemy trying to take me out. I'm going to bypass this thing." &gt;&gt; I mean, a spirit of comparison is a terrible punch. comparing this church and this church and that minister and this congregation and this and you know if we compare you know Paul says if you compare yourselves among yourselves he says you're unwise &gt;&gt; I don't believe I'm looking at foolish virgin this morning I believe look at the wise wise virgin amen so if we're wise we don't compare every church is different if you go look at different you know we're sheep right you go look at sheep in Scotland they're different to sheep here you know sheep in Australia is different to sheep here or South Africa or anywhere there's sheep, they're all different, but they're all sheep, &gt;&gt; right? They even they even have have have have proven that animals have accents, not just humans. So, a sheep and you know, Australian sheeple sound Australian. It's true. They've actually people have been paid to study these things. Hey, anyway, but but they sound slightly different, but they still have a sheep nature, right? And but but they're built for those conditions. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can't compare one sheep to another sheep because they're built to overcome the problems in that place. Right? It's just is the same thing with ministry. Same thing with God is a God of variety. Thank the Lord you don't all act and look like me. You can say amen. That's fine. See, God is a God of variety. We're not comp. You can't compare yourself to another person cuz you're different to that person. God made you you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so that spirit of comparison is a terrible knock. Amen. God has a people out of every kindred, tribe, and nation, tongue, and people. And in his books, they're all the same. One race is not superior to another. Amen. Oh, I'll just preach myself. Then we're all built the same way. Amen. There's no inferior race. Skin color don't matter to God. Amen. He's looking at that gene seed of predestination he put in your soul. That's what he looks for. And that's what we should look for as well in one another. When we see one another, WE SHOULD LOOK BEYOND THIS thing and say, "I see the word. I see a part of the bride. I see a part of myself." Amen. So, we must never have allow a spirit of comparison. And I think that it's such a problem in this day. We have so much stats and data and information about other countries, you know, oh, this is happening here and their their economy and this and blah blah blah all around the world. And then there's this this comparison. How's my sports team doing and all these things or my school or my results and all these things? It's a it's a punch because the devil doesn't want to make you feel good about yourself. He wants to make you feel very insignificant and build a big complex in your life and that's just a thing that's taking you out, &gt;&gt; right? Are we are we okay? Yo, I know we just had a wedding, but I'm sure we'll get happy eventually today. Amen. But you see, there's these things that God has God has revealed in his word, and it's the main thing. We can keep the punches off as much as you can. Amen. To walk humbly with thy God. Amen. Now, Brother Brham says this, I'm just laying a bit of a foundation. Hopefully, I'll build a house today. But, you know, he would speak this, I think, in the um Sardis Age and and and he takes a scripture here. This from the church age book. He says, "Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. I want to read another translation. I think it's the West translation of this verse. Be remembering therefore in what way you have received the truth as a permanent deposit and what way you heard it and be safeguarding it and have a change of mind at once. It is very evident from this verse that God has given them truth as a permanent deposit. That's what revelation is. It was received and it is irrevoc ir irrevocably theirs. It now remains to be seen that they will uh what they'll do with it whether they'll regard it or not. And that is true. They have been given the basic truth of the whole gospel. The just shall live by faith. Salvations of the Lord. This is this is the reformation time. They had heard the truth of the Bible which cast down the doctrines of Rome and said it not all papal authority. They knew the truth that the church does not save. They understood the Lord's supper. They had light on water baptism. They put out the images truth. There was never such an age with more men so much light to shed. They had enough illumination to completely I just like these words to completely overhaul the old system and to start out fresh and let God lead them line upon line and precept upon precept. This is the opportunity they had. And I say this morning, we still have that opportunity because the old way has been demolished. Amen. God has brought his word that we don't just have to continue with an old way of an old approach with God. But God has shown us in his word how to walk with him. They received the truth. They wanted and heard it. But the question was, how did they hear it? Did they hear it to build upon or was it the same attitude that many Greeks had, something to discuss or theorize over? Evidently, the rich words of truth were being heard in an academic manner rather than a practical outworking for God was demanding a change of mind concerning it. You see, so it was still a theory to them. It wasn't a for for it to be a practical outworking. And even I've been in countries, I've given people message books and you know, they tell me, "Well, I'll go read it and I'll tell you what I've learned." I said, "It's not about learning." I mean, this gospel is not an intellectual understanding. It's not it's not going to a school. It's letting God pour himself in. Amen. Where he reveals himself. He broods over your life. He begins to draw you. Amen. And you make a full surrender. God puts that word in you and and he and he makes it flesh in you. Amen. So we're not here just to theorize. &gt;&gt; We're not here to keep the message as a mystery. Amen. No. No. The mystery of God is finished in this day. Amen. It's now a reality. It's been revealed. Amen. It's not here to keep the word as a theory, but it's got to be it's got to have a practical outworking. Amen. So now this is the same thing with you know as we look into Micah here that there is a there is a way that they wanted to you know way that we must walk. Now I know this may be very elementary but you know this is the way to keep punches of you who don't who wants to avoid being punched &gt;&gt; who's not the devil's punching bag. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I think I think I think these things are helpful. Now Micah would say, "He has showed thee, oh man, what is good and and what does the Lord require of thee? But to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God." Now, now, now to do justly is to judge. That is to pronounce sentence. So as to have discernment, it's be to judge a righteous judgment. Amen. As Jesus would say, judge not according to the appearance, but to judge righteous judgment. Amen. So that's to God has given us the Holy Ghost in this day we know is the eagle anointing. Amen. It's the only of those four living creatures that is heaven heavenbound. Amen. It's not an earthbound creature of the lion or the ox or the or the man. Amen. But the eagle anointing of the Holy Ghost in this day takes us up into the heavenlies that we can look from eternity to eternity. We can actually look at the big picture of redemption. Amen. That we can look and see a person and and how they treat us, how they act. We can look beyond that. Amen. Where we're not just a tit for tat. You know, you said this, I'll say it in kind and just a carnal way of living. I tell you what, if you really have the Holy Ghost, you'll be able to look beyond how people treat you. IF YOU TREAT PEOPLE HOW they they treat you and you're carnal, I think you need a filling. Amen. You need a real baptism of the Holy Ghost where you can look beyond what is going on and you can be lifted up, amen, into the presence of God and see what that person's going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this is the anointing that we've been given. We can look beyond the five senses. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can let the word live through your life. I mean, you got trouble in your home. You got that eagle anointing. You can look beyond what's going on. And you can begin to say, "God, why are they like that? Why is my child going through these things? Why is my spouse acting this way?" And you can actually begin to let God give you the wisdom and the counsel that it's not just, well, they need to behave. They need to line up. But then you always look beyond that and say, "What is the why?" Do you believe he shows you the why? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe he actually shows you really what's going on? Just like, you know, brother Brown says, "If I have found grace in your sight through God, you take my words for this, brethren, if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong." So, who wants a blessing? &gt;&gt; Amen. So when a man has done you wrong and he's absolutely justly, I mean, he's done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong, he's done you evil, don't mention that. You take him to prayer before God &gt;&gt; and don't take it in a way just a selfish well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our father way a prayer should be made in the presence of God. Say father here's my brother and he justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't know why he did it. Then let God go talking to you. &gt;&gt; Do we really let God speak back to us? I believe, you know, communion is a two-way thing. It's not just us talking to the Lord and then he doesn't speak back. No, we serve a God that speaks. He counsels. He gives guidance. He reveals his word. I mean, we step into a situation, he gives you REVELATION FOR THAT MOMENT. AMEN. HE'S A GOD THAT SPEAKS. He's not a silent mute somewhere distant, but he's actively working in the lives of his children. Amen. So, so this is why we should always wait for him to speak back. I mean, if we're in the presence of the Lord, I believe, Amen. It's more than just going by a feeling, but God can give you just even just a few words, but it's concise. It's powerful, and it just answers the whole question. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then so he then let God go talking to you, and you'll see maybe what that man has been through. The devil's twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that, though, he's absolutely wrong. Before you leave the throne of God, you'll be feeling sorry for that man. You'll be sympathizing with that brother. And when you get back down where earth again, you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand. Amen. Cuz you know what he's been through. You can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody. And I think sometimes we we we allow God to be grieved that we get into such a carnal state that we forget what it's like to be in the presence of God. We're human, &gt;&gt; right? But we can get into such a mode and build a build a build a tower of quotes and scriptures to justify our stand, but God is not in it. That's not how we walk with our God. We got to do justly. We need we need righteous judgment to look beyond how people treat us because many times, you know, iron sharpens iron. We like to talk about that, yeah, we we're being molded and we're being shaped and but we don't realize it's the ones closest to us are the ones that really have the strongest knife or the or the biggest mortar and pestle. And you know, the ones that are in, you know, fellowship with us or in family especially, they're God's agents. &gt;&gt; You got to realize that everyone in your life is actually for your good. &gt;&gt; Amen. how they treat you, how they speak to you, if they disrespect you, if they're mean, IF THEY USE YOU, WHATEVER IT IS, THAT IS GOD'S agent in your life. And it's not because God is unhappy with you. It's not because God is beating you. No, God wants to mold and shape you into his image. AND HE WILL USE THE UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS. HALLELUJAH. I mean, where was where was Moses molded into a prophet? Wasn't in Pharaoh's palace. No, he had to forget all that stuff. It was 40 years on the backside of a desert with a hightempered wife with sheep and troubles and all these kind of things. God used the sand. He used the storms. HE USED THE HARDSHIP. AND THERE WAS MOSES BROKEN, MOLDED, SHAPED. HE BUT BUT HE WAS GETTING IN CONDITION. HALLELUJAH. So instead of him saying, "Why is me and this is not fair and this is wrong?" He just got used. God was doing a WORK BECAUSE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE the fact he was born under a sign that he was ordained for the job that he was there to deliver Israel out of Egypt. He knew in his heart that's what he was there for. And so God would USE BUT THE THING IS if we're selfish and we just we just look at us, we don't look at the big picture. I say spread your wings this morning in FAITH AND LET GOD TAKE YOU UP INTO the heavenlies and you REALIZE THAT THAT PROBLEM IN YOUR LIFE IS A BLESSING. &gt;&gt; That thing how that PERSON TREATS YOU. TODAY. THANK YOU, LORD. BECAUSE WHAT WOULD YOU be &gt;&gt; if you got everything on a silver platter and nothing went wrong and it was just like microwave instant life and everything was good. What kind of character would you have? Could you be on the throne as an overcomer? No, sir. You wouldn't even BE THE COURT JESTER. YOU WOULDN'T BE EVEN be there at ALL. YOU WOULDN'T BE WELCOME BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE character for the power OF GOD THAT HE'S PLACED IN YOUR LIFE. You got to have a character to operate that power. Amen. And God IS ALL THAT GOD GOD POURED INTO CHRIST, HE'S POURED INTO YOU AND I. AMEN. BUT NOW HE'S MOLDING OUR CHARACTER THAT WHEN HE WANTS THAT POWER ON FULL DISPLAY, WHICH IS IN THIS DAY, IT WILL MANIFEST ITSELF. IT'LL BE NO CARNAL, no carnal movement whatsoever. It will be God. &gt;&gt; God and flesh. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So friends, you got to realize the uncomfortable moments of life are God's blessings to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God is molding and shaping you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to realize no one is actually your enemy. Even the devil's just a tool in God's hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I MEAN, BASICALLY, GOD SET THE DEVIL ON JOB FOR JOB TO WAKE up and realize who he was. Amen. God wanted Job to have an eagle vision, an eagle anointing. I mean, that he could stand there and say, "Now I know my redeemer liveth." I mean, before that, he was blessed. He loved the Lord sure and he was trusting in the sacrifice of the lamb. But the thing is he did not know where he came from. He didn't know where he was going. He was just sitting in this natural kind of a life though a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God God basically SET THE DEVIL WHO POINTED the job out to the devil. It wasn't one of his imps. It wasn't some other demon. It was God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. But before the devil even touched um touched Job, God had a testimony. &gt;&gt; He's a perfect man. There's none like him in all the world. But I want him to be developed further. That I want to take the fear out of his life, the worry, the stress. I want to give him such a ROCK SOLID PEACE. AMEN. That what? Hallelujah. That when he comes OUT THE OTHER SIDE, HE'LL BE SHINING HIS GOLD. AMEN. THAT THEN thousands of years after him, I will stand in flesh, the Lord, AND HE'LL POINT BACK TO the patience of Job as a testimony to all generations. Amen. Wouldn't it be wonderful if God could do that with you and I? Amen. IF TIME WOULD PROGRESS LONG ENOUGH, AMEN. that someone would be INSPIRED TO SAY, "REMEMBER MY MY SERVANT MORGAN?" &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Any of the brethren, brothers, sisters in here, THE PATIENCE THEY HAD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO STAND THE TEST. AMEN. JUST TRUST THE LORD. AMEN. NO MATTER WHAT WAS going on. Amen. Cuz God, what has HE DONE WITH YOU AND I IN THIS DAY? HE'S PUT YOU FORTH AS A TESTIMONY. AMEN. Of of his redeeming power. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So Job, he got through that. He went through all that. But he could say, "I I'm going to stand on the earth with him. In my flesh, I'll see God." Hallelujah. All but all those problems, God actually used the devil as a tool. I'm going to use you, Satan, as a vehicle to give revelation. &gt;&gt; Now, the devil didn't impart it to Job, but God used the devil to get Job in a position to receive it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we want everything nice. No one like I don't like pain. No one likes pain, I don't think, in their right mind. Right? But God, we we got to look. We got to zoom out and say, "Actually, this is all for my good, even if I don't know why." Praise the Lord. Now, let's finish this. I mean, you can't stand uh with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody. I don't believe no, sir. Even if he's a ranked sinner. What about a brother that's made a mistake? Though I say he's sometimes accused wrong when he's not wrong. But if he is wrong, well, we should take him to the throne of God, stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our brother, knowing that he's immortal, and maybe his destination rests upon our attitude towards him. &gt;&gt; Attitude, how do we treat one another? &gt;&gt; Oh, that family or that brother or this? Have you Have you lifted them up? Have you stood with them in prayer? took them before the throne of God. You can do this. You say, "Oh, no. That's just the prophet." No, it's for you. It's the bride of Jesus Christ. What is our attitude towards one another? Oh, they didn't shake my hand 5 years ago. Can we let these things go? That's not doing justly. That's not having divine judgment. That's not having It's not having discernment. We have bad days. Yeah. I'm glad someone's honest. We all [laughter] we all have bad days, right? I'm not making excuses, but we're all human. These bodies have not been changed. Our human spirit has not been changed. Our soul is redeemed and and and our spirit and our body are going to catch up with our soul, right? But they're still human, subject to mistakes, problems, personality clashes. I don't just gel with them. You will. There's not going to be anywhere in heaven where the extroverts are here, the introverts are here, and the deep thinkers are over there. We're all just going to be one big. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One big group. I don't get ALONG WITH THAT SIDE OF HEAVEN. I NEVER GO THERE. THAT'S NEVER GOING TO BE IN ANYONE'S MIND. YOU THINK OF SOMEONE, IT'LL JUST BE SUPREME JOY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM FOR A MILLENNIA. LET'S GO SEE THEM. I MISS YOU. AND YOU PICK UP A CONVERSATION. IT'S LIKE, YOU'RE never a part. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not like, oh, no, I'm not. No, those people. Oh, no. That don't exist there. I think if it don't exist there, it shouldn't exist here. Amen. Because we're creatures of there, not creatures of earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's always have the right attitude. I believe if we have that eagle anointing, we will have the right attitude. Will we uh not get hurt? No, we'll still get hurt. &gt;&gt; We'll still even get offended. We'll see even carry questions and misunderstandings. But if the anointing of God is in your life, he can lift you up and show you the whole thing. He can just rest. Oh, but what if they don't apologize? That's irrelevant. Jesus wasn't hanging on Calvary and said, "Now, high priest and Sanhedrin and all you people that hate me and and are actually rejoicing. This is the only time he saw them happy is when he was dying on Calvary." He didn't say, "Now, uh, are you sorry for what you're doing to me? &gt;&gt; Then I'll forgive you." &gt;&gt; No, he said, "Father, forgive them. They don't KNOW WHAT THEY DO." THAT WAS THE LAST MANIFESTATION OF GOD AS A MAN BEFORE HIS HIS RESURRECTION WAS THAT EXPRESSION. WHAT WILL be the bride before the translation? I MEAN THAT SAME SPIRIT, that same heart, THAT SAME ATTITUDE BE FATHER FORGIVE THEM. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO. &gt;&gt; I believe we're living in that season. Oh, one day. No, today 2025 is a good time. I mean, WE'RE LIVING IN THE LAST FEW MOMENTS FOR THE CHANGE OF THE BODY. &gt;&gt; I mean, SO WHAT IS CHRIST GOING to be manifested as bride? Cuz remember brother Aaron says she is him. So all that you see in the bridegroom is in the bride. There's no difference. Amen. It's the same manifestation. THE SAME GOD LIVING IN A MULTI-MEMBERED PEOPLE NOW. So what so what's the attitude of us going to be? Father forgive them. They don't know what they do. Oh, I have to do it. No, it's out of your heart. Lord, I don't want a bad attitude towards anyone. I don't want any kind of, oh, they better be pushed down there. And Lord, you better make different levels of heaven. Put them at the bottom one. We shouldn't have that kind of an attitude. I'm not trying to make jokes, but you know, like we Yeah, we want to see everyone saved, but just put them down the slums somewhere. No, we shouldn't have that attitude. We should have a attitude. Lord, I want to see them there. Even Even if I don't get there, may they get there. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Oh, but I want to get there. Yeah, but wouldn't you be happy to see someone to be part of someone getting there? We're going to celebrate one another getting a crown of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because we have that attitude, &gt;&gt; Lord. They made it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, the biggest celebrations of those watching the saints get crowned be those who knew them in the flesh that battled with them, walked with them, had fellowship, prayed together, cried together. Amen. Because we'll see, Lord, you your grace is so amazing. Hallelujah. Amen. We won't be quiet. Oh, well, next. Who's next on the list? No, we'll be rejoicing &gt;&gt; together. &gt;&gt; We made it, brother and Paul. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's going TO BE A GLORIOUS MOMENT. AMEN. WHEN WE SEE ONE ANOTHER CROWNED, HE SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, THAT I CAN BE IDENTIFIED ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH SAINTS LIKE THESE." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I think we should just start having that attitude right now. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then you'll be able to realize that brother, that sister that just grinded me the wrong way. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Thank you for the struggle. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the inner turmoil, Lord. Thank you THAT DROVE ME TO PRAYER. DIDN'T DRIVE me to gossip and to BE BITTER AND RESENTFUL. BUT LORD, IT BROUGHT ME TO A PLACE WHERE THE SWEETNESS of God came into my life. &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, how do you do that?" It's very simple. When Moses crossed the Red Sea with the children of Israel, they journeyed three days, no water. They came to a a you know, water. They thought they're going to be refreshed. It was a bitter water. They came to a bitter experience after a great jubilee dancing on the seashore seeing their enemies dead. Brother Ron said that's the type of when you come through the blood you look back and see all your enemies are dead in the blood. You begin to DANCE AND REJOICE. GOD TOOK them from a jubilee into a bitter time. But God was proving something because Moses was inspired to cut down a tree, a certain tree, mix it with the water and it became sweet. So God was showing that an an experience may be bitter, but there's something hanging there. That tree was Calvary. That tree was the cross. THAT IF YOU MIX CALVARY WITH ANY BITTER EXPERIENCE, no matter how deep, how bad, how hurtful, how scarring, if you mix IT WITH CALVARY, IT WILL BECOME A SWEET THING IN YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW'S IT BECOME SWEET? Thank you for taking saving me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for lifting me up out of that bitterness. Thank you. I can embrace that brother, embrace that sister with love instead of resentment and building walls. Lord, thank you for doing a work in my life and SHOW ME WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH, LORD, THAT I CAN LOVE THEM AND PRAY FOR THEM, have a burden for them, Lord, like I never did before. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm a sweet tooth, so I like sweet things. So, I always want to mix Calvary with any experience. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We have the odd that you can't do that. Yeah, you can try it one time. Try it one time. It's been my whole life has been bitter. No, it'll become sweet. &gt;&gt; You see redemption take place and become sweet. Amen. Nomi said, "Don't call me Nomi anymore. My life is bitter. Call me, you know, all these things." But what happened? Redemption came into her life. Amen. Through Ruth, IT BECAME A SWEET TIME. ALL THOSE MEMORIES of loss and those years and those things, IT WAS RESTORED TO HER. AND THEN WHEN RUTH had the baby by Boaz, you know, her grandchild, grandson came into HER LIFE. AMEN. NOW SHE could rejoice ever more cuz now she was embracing life. Amen. And you just let redemption take place. You start embracing life. Amen. The life of God. Hallelujah. And all that business would be Lord that was for a purpose. Lord your eternal work. I didn't UNDERSTAND THOSE FOOTSTEPS. EVEN my husband saying let's go and live in Moab and all these things. And you know nights of wondering why and how did my life come to this. But then life came. Redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. What'd she do? She took that bitter experience of her life and mixed it with Calvary and it became sweet. You can do it. Don't be afraid to do it. Don't be used to just living a bitter life. Why? I'd rather live on the mountain &gt;&gt; that in the valley. He say, "Well, you can't be in boat." We just take the valley with you up the mountain. I'm a Christian and good times or bad. Amen. I don't want to be selfish anytime. If I'm a believer, I forfeited my rights. You know, you know, this is an age of people's rights. Well, they're wrong and they didn't do this to me, so therefore, I'll do this and all these things. This is my rights. We forfeit our rights. &gt;&gt; We let God just share it all off. &gt;&gt; I'm your lamb, Lord. Do with me what you want. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As long as I'm his lamb. &gt;&gt; That's the Because he can't lose one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the sun goes down, all the other animals are left on the pasture. But the shepherd takes his sheep into the fold. Amen. When this age closes, the rapture takes place. If I'm his lamb, I'm going in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, amen. And to love mercy. We just I'm just breaking this down as we go. I hope you don't mind this. We're just having a we're having a time. I mean, but but but we should it should just be our nature to love mercy. Just to love it. I mean, not to not to love casting people down, not to love gossiping, not loving to spread rumors and malice and strife. It shouldn't even it's not even in the nature of a believer. Now, that's a carnal nature, right? That's a carnal nature. But the spiritual nature of a believer should be I love mercy. I don't want to see anyone go through anything that they shouldn't go through. I don't want to see people thrown out. I'm not here to be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff to try and help someone. Who's heard of that saying? You know, they put an am there's a cliff, someone falls off and they put an ambulance here to just pick that up the pieces. So, we don't want to have an attitude among us that, you know, there's people that we shun in church and we just basically by our attitude push them out and now they're in the world now. Let's have prayer meetings and fast and pray for that person. That's the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. That's not loving mercy. That's just having a judgmental superior spirit trying to push someone out. We should abhore that kind of a feeling. Amen. We should it it should grieve us when someone doesn't come to church anymore. It should bother us greatly. Where is that person? Where's that brother? Where's that sister? What's going on? We should have a genuine concern because we're not an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. We're at the top of the cliff. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we should love. Now, now this mercy, I think it's from the Oxford dictionary. It says compassion or forgiveness shown towards someone whom it is within one's power to punish your harm. This is what mercy is. Oh, I can punish that per I can harm their character. I can harm their harm harm their reputation, spreading gossip and malice about these, you know, different people. That is not someone who's full of mercy and compassion. Amen. But someone who's full of mercy, Amen. They will they will have they will have such a atmosphere about them that they just want all those things to go away. They want to fill the breach. They don't want any gaps between anybody. They don't want any golf. Who's with me this morning? I mean they want to see love flow. I mean they'll see someone who's maybe acting out or you know acting up all these things. They don't want to push that person down. You know we never want an attitude. Oh that make that person makes the church look bad. It's not about what we look like. That that's just hypocritical. This is meant to be a place where people come broken, they get mended. &gt;&gt; People who are troubled, they they find peace. People who don't know who they are, they could be dressed up. They could be they could be all kinds of sides of the alphabet rainbow stuff. &gt;&gt; And we don't shun them. We say, "God bless you. &gt;&gt; Welcome." We don't say, "Oh, you can't come in here." Everyone's welcome &gt;&gt; because God is here to bring healing and deliverance and a true identity through the message of the hour where we realize that we are part of the open book. Amen. Because because brother Ram said that Boh Boaz claiming Ruth is the same as Christ taking the book. Amen. So our identity is we are the lamb's wife. And if anyone comes in to come under the sound of the word, we should say Lord I believe they're one of yours. So why should we want to push anyone out? Someone who's in their teenage years just trying to find their feet. You don't push them down. &gt;&gt; You don't push young people out. You encourage them. Someone's in their early 20s still trying to find their feet. We don't push them down. Newly married or longtime married, whoever, doesn't matter what age, you don't push anyone down. That's not loving mercy. That's just trying to make, oh, but the church will look bad. Sure, we we don't go beyond the word, but why would we worry about what it looks like? That's pride. &gt;&gt; Does my church look good? Does it sound the best? That's just a spirit of comparison. You're just getting hits. You're just getting punches by the devil. No, we should just let anyone come in. And I I know you do. It should be our heart, right? &gt;&gt; If God saved you, do you think he say, "What about the person on the street?" &gt;&gt; When the Lord found me, I realized he can save anybody. He can find anyone. I was well, you know my testimony. God found me in darkness making homebrew, partying university student. Even would have written me off, but God didn't. &gt;&gt; So why should we write someone off? &gt;&gt; Oh, they blasphemed whatever. No, no, that's God's God's the judge. God is God is God. I'm not God. Thank you, Lord. I'm glad. You know, you know, why do we make ourselves God? Let him be God. &gt;&gt; Let him make those decisions. Amen. And now Jesus would say, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." Now merciful here is to be compassionate. It's by word or deed and and and especially by divine grace. This is how you're merciful. Now divine grace is an in it's it's the influence of God upon our heart and its reflection in our life. That's how you know if you've really come under grace is that the spirit of God takes control of your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you're merciful, you'll obtain mercy. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why we should love mercy. You know, you know, it's like children, right? There's a big fight going on and you know, if they're not the naughty one, they want to they want the they want the whole corporal punishment. They want the fullest extent of the law of the house to be poured out upon their sibling that's done them wrong. But if it's them in their shoes, they're pleading mercy. They're saying, "Sorry, you know, they're saying, "Forgive me. I really didn't mean it." But if they're the if they're the victim, they're like, "Get them. deal with him. Amen. We want mercy, &gt;&gt; right? So why would we want someone else have the full extent of God's wrath poured upon them? Amen. All right. Amen. Now when pride cometh, then cometh shame. But with the lowly, which is the word humble, is wisdom. Last part of that verse was to walk humbly with our God. Now to be humble is very very powerful because it's through the humble that God will manifest his word. Now I'm just trying to find where I am on my notes so I'm kind of jumping around a bit. Now a true humility is not wearing old clothes, driving an old car, kind of being a bit backward. A true humility is being surrendered to the word. That's true humility. Okay. Now, with true humility, God can flow through that life. As I said in the beginning where, you know, we talk about Enoch's walk and Enoch would have had a humble walk. Okay. So, now when Isaiah when Isaiah was in the temple, now I just want you to think about this. There he was. He was in the most holy place, the temple, in the most holy city, Jerusalem, living among one of living among and he was one of God's people. He was a covenant son of Abraham and he also was a prophet. But you see, he had to learn to walk a way that pleases God. Okay? He was in a place that looked pleasing, but the whole nation needed needed God. Okay? So we can't get we can't lean upon a message system to say I'm doing okay. It's you and God walking together. Right? It's not based on your parents. It's not based on your siblings or your church. It's you and God. Okay. The thing is what happened was is is um Isaiah he was being influenced too much by by the king Uzziah. He was leaning. Brother Bam would speak about many times of you know you're the you're the message influence. And he says he was influenced by the king. And he was influenced by him so much that he wasn't influenced by almighty God as much as he should have been. And the scripture says in Isaiah 6, in the year that King Uzziah died, he was in the temple. He saw the Lord high and lifted up. I'm sure we all know the story. I remember what but what happened is Isaiah was disappointed in Uziah's ending. How he would end up because Uzziah got lifted up in pride. Basically all he did, he touched it, turned to gold. He put it that way. He's blessed in every way. So he just decided, I can go beyond my office and be a priest. And you know the story, there's I don't know how many 70 of them or something of the priest saying, you know, don't don't go offer incense. You know, King Uzziah, you're a good king, but you're not a priest. You're not ordained to be so. But he thought he can do what he wanted. So he took that sensor. He went into offer incense to the Lord. He got and he was full-blown leper. And he died that way. So Isaiah was disappointed by how by how um Uzziah ended up. It shook Isaiah. See these things are good for us. It shook Isaiah. It shook his faith. It pulled the rug from under his feet of what he was trusting in security for. Oh, my pastor's the best one. He can preach like no one else. My church is this way. He was getting knocks from that spirit of comparison. And God had to take those things away from him because he had a far more important job than just being being influenced by the king. He had to write the Bible in 66 chapters. Amen. He had to write incredible prophecies. God had to use him in a way that he could not be used being just under this influence of the king. Now, God did this because God wanted to be his main influence. And you'll find if you get disappointed in another believer, it's cuz many times we put them on a pedestal. Amen. And we and we lift them up into a place they're not ordained to be. And it might not even be sin that makes you disappointed. Just maybe an attitude or something they say or something that transpires. And we can become disappointed in one another, which we do. We're human. Okay? But the but the reason God does that is he's actually trying to get your attention. You've been trusting or leaning upon that person too much. So I have to make you disappointed in them. So you will turn to me. And so Isaiah, he was there in the temple. And he was he was he was there. He went to the right place. He was disappointed because God wanted to give him a right walk. And so God allowed this falling out to take place, these failures, these incidents to happen. So Isaiah could get into a state where he could see this heavenly have this heavenly visitation and he could make a confession and a cleansing and and he could be put into action. Amen. So now Isaiah when he remember he he's in the most holy place, the temple in the most holy city, Jerusalem. He's one of God's holy people, a circumcised son of Abraham. But when God when he had this visitation, he just cried out, "Woe is me, for I'm undone." Here is now a man who's starting to walk justly with his God and know mercy and to walk humbly with his God. As we read in Micah, he cried out, "Woe is me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips." Amen. And for my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts. So he be to he be to realize actually we're all in the same state. That's why I was saying before, you take some before the throne of God in prayer, you realize the state they're in, but you realize the state you're in. Amen. And so God moved him in this way that he could actually walk humbly with his God. We got to realize without God's God's keeping power, where would we be? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not our human ability that holds on to God. It's not our human ability that gets us into a rapture. It's God's power and enablement by his Holy Ghost. Amen. It is the message of the hour that's given you the grace of God. Amen. It's God's grace finding you. It's not us, oh well, I did this and I did that. That's not a testimony. The testimony is God did it and I was just there at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was just there when he showed up. That's what brother said about the Ohio River. He said, "I was just there when he came." &gt;&gt; Shouldn't that be our attitude as well? &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he could he could walk humbly with his God. Now, I just want you to think about who's in our midst this morning. Amen. And I'm going to get to humility. We are not in the midst of a religious system. We are not in the midst of a of a nice idea or a human movement. We're not even in the midst of a prophet messenger, though that would be amazing to be in those days. So, I'm not I'm not putting those things down. But who is in our midst in 2025? Who has never left thee nor forsaken me? Who has been with you in the good times and the bad? Amen. More than just an angel, more than just a, you know, more than just a seraraphim or a cherubam or even an archangel, but the Lord God Almighty, amen, is in our midst. And brother Ram would say in the restoration of the bride, and I pray this just comes out how it's blessed me for a long time. Amen. Hallelujah. And the restoration of the bride tree, brother Ram would take the time when Jesus was dead to when he was revealed himself to the disciples. It's just like Luther's day. It was just a dead form. But then but then uh in the third day there was a rumor like in the day of Pentecost there was a rumor that God is alive but he went from a rumor to a reality when he stepped into the midst of the disciples and said here I am touch I'm alive give me something to eat. Amen. So he was no longer a rumor but he was a vindicated FACT OR A VINDICATED TRUTH. HE was a resurrected God. Amen. That was in their midst walking talking moving among them. friends. So, we are no longer living just with a rumor of God. Is he still alive? Is the message still true? Is God really a God of miracles? Does he really do what he said he WOULD DO? THE DAYS OF RUMOR are over. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're living in a DAY WHERE HE WALKS AMONG US. HIS SPIRIT MOVES AND HE BREWS AND HE TOUCHES LIVES AND GETS A HOLD of lives AND REVEALS HIS WORD and proves himself THROUGH THE BRIDE. AMEN. WE'RE NO LONGER LIVING A DAY. THIS IS NOT A RUMOR DAY OF A HEARAY AND A MAYBE AND A NO. WE KNOW HE'S ALIVE. I MEAN, WE KNOW HE'S PRESENT. I MEAN, WE KNOW HE WORKS. WE KNOW HIS WORD IS TRUE. I MEAN, WE KNOW THAT WE'RE WALKING LIKE ENOCH WALKED. AMEN. Cuz why? Cuz God has revealed himself. Many people say, "If only I could go back in the days of the prophet, this is a better day." &gt;&gt; And if he COULD BE HERE, HE WOULD BE HERE. If he could be here. BUT THAT WAS HIS TIME. AMEN. TO GIVE A WORD. AMEN. THAT A BRIDE WOULD PICK IT UP BY REVELATION AND God would manifest himself through every part of that bride. Amen. So, we're not living in a day of a rumor. Now, he's not physically here in his corporal body. We'll meet that in the air. I just want this as an illustration. He went from a rumor, but he appeared among them. They were holed up in a little a little life, a little a little world, a little room, but then he stepped through. He broke into their little religious what's going on and the world's falling apart and we live in such a bad day and we didn't expect it to be this way. And he went from that then he you know you know the woman come from the tomb and they just said it was idle tales but then he he stepped in. He said here I am. I am alive. I am the resurrection and the life. I am the dynamics. I'm here to resurrect you. I'm here to give you a rapture. I'm here to give you salvation. I'm here to pull myself in. I'm here to prove my word through your life. Amen. So it went from a rumor to a reality. I say friends, we if you want deity in your midst, welcome and receive the word. Now that's a quote. IF YOU WANT DEITY TO BE IN YOU, NOT A RELIGION, FORGET RELIGION. THE REALITY OF THIS WORD. AMEN. THIS MESSAGE MUST PUT ON FLESH. AMEN. AND IT IS PUTTING ON FLESH. IN 2025, [cheering] DOESN'T MATTER HOW OLD OR YOUNG YOU ARE, YOU GIVING YOUR LIFE TO THE LORD. GOD BEGINS TO POUR HIMSELF in and prove himself that when people see YOU, THEY SEE THIS MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? God is doing that because he's showing you're walking with me. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to say God's walking with me, but it's another thing to say, I'm walking with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, now you're walking humbly with your God. What have you done? You allow the word to always be right &gt;&gt; in every circumstance. That's a humble person. Amen. They're not just backward and timid and old. clothes and stuff. No, they let the word rule them. Hallelujah. So what happens now? There's something comes within us. Here I am Lord. I don't have it on the scripture but you know here I am Lord send me that I can walk into this world and be a living witness. Brother Ram says this God is going to restore by shining forth the evening light what? to restore the whole word of God again. The full manifestation of Christ in his church. Everything that he did just exactly the way he did, it would be again in the evening light. See what I mean? Oh, isn't that wonderful? He's done it. I know I've been preaching along these lines for a few weeks, but I just want this to anchor in. We're back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not in Egypt. &gt;&gt; WE'RE ON SOME DEAD RELIGIOUS FORM. WE'RE NOT IN THE WILDERNESS JUST FIGHTING IN CHURCH SPLITS AND TROUBLE AND ALL THESE THINGS. NO, WE'VE CROSSED JORDAN. WE'RE IN THE PROMISED LAND, THE SON OF MAN. WE'RE EATING OFF THE GOOD OF THE LAND. WE'RE IN OUR INHERITANCE IN CHRIST. EVERY ENEMY THAT COMES AGAINST US MUST FALL UNDER OUR FEET. WE'VE SEEN DEMONS FALL. WE'VE SEEN DEMONS CAST OUT, SICKNESS GONE, COMPLEXES GO, TROUBLES LEAVE, THE HOLY GHOST POURED OUT. WE'VE SEEN MANY MIGHTY THINGS. WHY? CUZ WE'RE LIVING IN THE LAND. AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THESE FOUR WALLS. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU. WHEREVER YOU ARE, YOU'RE LIVING IN THE LAND. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE A RESURRECTION PEOPLE. AMEN. WE ARE A PEOPLE. GOD BY HIS GRACE IS CALLED TO DO JUSTLY, TO LOVE MERCY, AND TO WALK HUMBLY with our God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. The Lord spoke this a couple of years ago. Thus sayith the Lord. My word came forth in this place when you began. If you keep humble before me, my word will continue to come. It will find souls and they'll find rest. That is why I have called you again to humble thyself again before me. There are souls that need my rest. You must be humble. You must be humble before me and they shall find their rest. I have not left. Amen. So a humble a HUMBLE PERSON. AMEN. GOD CAN SPEAK THROUGH THAT it his word will find souls and they'll find rest. See it's not us mechanically witnessing. You just be surrendered. you all humble and then and then it just it's you talking to someone and then God just opens the door &gt;&gt; and you begin to speak to that person and God deposits his word. He begins to bring it forth and then maybe that just it just stops and you go back to your day. Then someone else the same thing. Who's had that experience? &gt;&gt; Say you step into a bubble. The whole person just changes you. You can really talk to them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What is that? That's a humble person. It's God's word finding souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They'll find rest. That's why it's so important if we really remain humble, if we if we are truly humble people, then God can reach through you and get a hold of a life. More than having just a nice talk about something, God steps in. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm nearly done. I'm really nearly done. James 4:6. But he but he giveth more grace wherewith he saith, God resists the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Amen. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Now the word grace in the New Testament it means a manner or act abstract or concrete literal, figurative or spiritual especially the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life. Amen. So someone who is humble God gives grace. He influences that person. He rules from their soul. He He influences how they speak, their attitude, how they think, how they treat people, lost or found, bride or not. God gives grace to that. How who wants more grace? &gt;&gt; Who wants who wants God just to pour himself in like never before? Amen. To give you such a divine influence that when people look at you say that person's connected to heaven. What was the what was the broadband there at the thing? 300 up and 300 down or something. You know, incredible internet there where we had the wedding. Wouldn't you like your connection to be like that with you and God? 300 up, 300 down, or infinity up, infinity up, whatever number. You know, there's just such you just you just love the Lord. You're walking about your day. Amen. There's joy in my soul, and you're just happy. And God begins to minister to you wherever you are, and you you just you're just living a sweet, humble Christian life. And God lives. &gt;&gt; God has shown us. God has shown us that above all things have fervent charity, divine love among yourselves, for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. This is someone who's walking humbly with their God. They just want love because the more you have of him, the more of him you want others to experience. And the more you have of him, the more you want, right? So, you don't want anything that would jar that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You want nothing that will grieve. You don't want any fussing, fighting. If there's trouble, you talk about you, but you want peace, right? Because you just want such an atmosphere where God feels so welcome. Hallelujah. You know, you go on a trip, there's places you like to stop because you've been there before. You've enjoyed it. Wouldn't you like it if God? Because remember, God is walking through this generation. Wouldn't you like it if God saying, "I'm going to make a trip now through Lady Oia. I'm in 2025. I'm going to 2026. Then there's going to be the rapture." Hey, if it's before Christmas, that'll be nice. But you know what I mean. And then and he's like, I'm going to make a stop at my daughter's house or my son's house in their life. They're driving along, man. I love to drive with them. And God has feelings. God cares. God enjoys our presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be having a hard day. He doesn't look at the hard day you're having. He's looking at your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, oh man, they're going through something to I just love to be with them. &gt;&gt; Happy, sad, mad, or glad. Well, glad. But, you know, he loves to be with us. But wouldn't we like it if God would pick out one place? It'd be your place. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to live that kind of a life? Oh, we can't have peace in our house because of X, Y, and Zed. No, I've got better math. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ cancels out both sides of the equation. The love of God takes away both sides of the equation. It destroys the entire equation. It destroys your past, your grudges, your hurts, ALL THOSE THINGS, THOSE PUNCHES you've been receiving by the devil. Actually, I pray God just open our eyes of understanding. say, "We can bypass this. We can live a different kind of a life. We don't have to go back to where we're from and get into the same old rut that we found ourselves in. We can do things differently." Well, why not? &gt;&gt; Oh, but I got to swallow my pride. Just spit it out, man. &gt;&gt; Get rid of the thing. It's not worth holding on to. Just let God be God. Praise the Lord. Let's just Let's just finish this, shall we? Can we have the musicians? We'll just wrap this up. But I trust he's shown you. Amen. God bless you, friends. Now, when I've read the scripture, I'm not trying to teach you anything like that you don't know. But there's something in our hearts we're like, "Yeah, we like to do justly. We like to actually have discernment about to judge, right, righteously. We like to we love mercy." You know, I'm sure there's, you know, he's like, "Of course, this is this is me, right? And we love to walk humbly with our God because we know there's power in humility. So I just want to encourage you friends. You want the punches off of you, walk like that. Say, "God, change my life." That my Christian walk like Enoch was is exactly that. That Lord, that scripture is now just that's just me. That's just my life. Doesn't matter if I'm at work, at home, school, job, church, wherever. That's me. It's who I am. I can't help it. It's your nature in me that's produced it. Amen. Let's um let's stand this morning, shall we? We need to sing that song. God's power is alive. Okay. I just that was just so powerful on Wednesday. I just enjoyed that so much. Amen. Okay. Gee, I mean, we could just um Okay, we don't necessarily need to sing the [music] um first verse. We just start singing the chorus. Amen.

It is more alive. &gt;&gt; You know, BROTHER, A PROPHET SEES THINGS IN ITS FULL MANIFESTATION, though it's seed form when he see, you know, where he's living. So he saw you as that bride marching upwards in step arrod in God's righteousness. He saw the full manifestation though it was a seed form bride back in that AGE BUT HE SAW YOU MARCHING in step. Amen. So I say this message is more alive. If you want to read the newspaper read this message what brother Adam said about Russian all everything going on. It's today's news. &gt;&gt; Amen. At you the the condition of the world everything it's all in the word. It was spoken back then 60 years ago. Communion, the communion message, I think was or the 12th. 60 years ago was the last message the prophet preached. But it's more real and alive now than it was then cuz God and his grace has opened up our eyes of understanding. [music] Amen. We can walk with him. Amen. Amen. Let's sing this, shall we?
