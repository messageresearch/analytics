it's privilege to have you all here who's come expecting who has a need we've had a visiting ministers come through church and it's like we set them down for days telling them every situation and we've told them nothing and God just comes with his word and speaks to people personally everything they're going through he's the same God here he's here to meet our needs he's here to get a hold of us I mean I believe he wants camp more than we wanted camp hallelujah so don't you love him I mean just so just one announcement I believe he's present amen just one announcement there is a day visitor fee for the day visitors we're not going to chase you but if you'd like to contribute towards it there's the box at the back but just let's just sing that again just as brother Denny comes I won the Lord to speak to me and he's the Lord is here he loves you very much even if you feel no one loves you he loves you I mean he he purchase your Redemption he's your Redeemer he's come to meet with you brother perhaps either he had come down to cool the evening amen in the garden to speak with Adam and even it's a did you enjoy your day so we enjoyed our day we may have had a very hard day but he wants to come down so have you enjoyed your walk I mean because this is not the end of your walk I'm going to take you in a rapture I'm going to take you into heaven have you enjoyed your day it changes the whole perspective when you realize this is just a little piece of a hickey on the part of eternity and it's going to come to an end and we're gonna be any charity with him it'll be worth it all I mean sir just as brother Danny comes this cygnus don't you love the Lord Jesus I mean just say thank you Lord I can walk in the life you allowed me to walk in your life we'll walk [Music] the beautiful [Music] I know [Music] Jesus [Music] the world can we sing it one more time we're walking the line whoa we walk in the line such a beautiful lie [Music] Oh a man or the most privileged people on the face of the earth aren't we hey god bless you can be seated for a moment amen well it's certainly good to be here and just want to say what a privilege it is amen to come and be a part of this I guess it's a youth camp but it's from age 14 to 30 35 why didn't we make it 50 amen then I could have been included amen well I guess I am anyhow but I mean I think the youth is this getting older and older I don't know but it's just certainly wonderful to be here part of this and and to put our shoulder to the effort amen with her brother Ben and amen and brother al ray we certainly appreciate the invitation may God bless you for it amen for the burden upon your heart amen to have this meeting I don't believe it's just the burden of men I believe it's a burden of God amen and God places that burden upon us and then he expects us to move in it and we trust that for every one of you young people in this meeting that God will place a burden upon you but you are responsible for that burden and your be convicted by it and God will move in your life and you can look back to this time of meetings and say God did something for me there that the enemy can never take away from me and we're all your cheerleaders amen we're all your cheerleaders is that right cheerleaders come on I'm going to need your help a man we're all cheerleading you on just like somebody did us and we are here to encourage one another we're here to tell you that you're somebody in the name of the Lord amen and so I just want to say thank you and I just trust that that I can say something that would encourage you in your walk with the Lord and well let's just make a statement of faith before the meeting ever ever begins people are going to be healed young people are going to be delivered say you shouldn't say that well why not the devil is telling us everything else Amen young people are gonna be filled with the Holy Ghost chains are gonna be broken can you agree with me Amen why would you say that because we live in the most evil age the most evil time go against the most evil of adversaries but he said greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world and I'm so thankful for that amen so god bless you I just appreciate the lovely spirit that's in the room amen and I know that you brought it with you so god bless you for that and we just trust wonderful things will be done in this weekend so amen we also bring you greetings from from home from Sarasota Florida the saints of God they're in the church House of fellowship amen they're all praying for this meeting they don't know what day it is but they're praying for it and so when I go home I got to go back to you know yesterday but I came into tomorrow to have service so even and so they're all confused about what the time is here but they're praying and they may not be praying exactly at the right time of the meeting but they are praying so even that means a lot amen and so I also bring greetings from my family from my wife and I would sure love to just pack them all up and bring him here and let him enjoy the wonderful fellowship in the wonderful place that we're in amen but but it just couldn't be so but we're here the Lord's here and you're here and everyone he knew exactly would be here is here so it's also so wonderful to see some friends that I I've known a long time of known brother all ray and and his wife sister pillow before they moved here to New Zealand and they've just been precious friends and and we just appreciate them and each one of you that we've seen and met before god bless you we appreciate brother Ben and his wife sister Christine and their hospitality amen and the burn upon their heart I just all I could say just god bless you I hope that's enough amen well wasn't enough he didn't seem too excited well anyway god bless you anyhow amen so we love you with the love of the Lord let's all stand together let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer well let's just invite the Lord to have his way in these meetings I mean there's been already many prayers have gone up even in this service and there's been songs of Zion sung now the battle begins and so let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we couldn't approach you any other way but through the blood of Jesus Christ and we come large thinking you Father for your many wonderful mercies and grace that you have bestowed upon us Lord Lord the least we can do in this service is lift our voice to acknowledge and give praise for what you have done Lord I pray for each one of these precious young people in each one of these precious people that is here that you'd bestow something upon them Eternal Father something Lord in their life Lord they're needy people surely we know that father but we don't know their needs but Lord you're the same yesterday today and forever and you do know their needs Lord and and I pray you just speak right to them as a we're go right to their chair move into their life Lord go into their rooms Lord and amen divide Lord asunder Lord the flesh and the bone and the spirit Lord and may your word just circumcise the heart Lord and bring to pass Lord the promise of your word father in their lives fill with the Holy Ghost Lord heal them in their bodies and in their spirits father may you bring a great deliverance in this room father and you can begin it tonight Lord it does not have to be a breaking-in period father you can do it right now father for your the mighty God and we love you Lord now we can just commit ourselves to you anoint my lips Lord and 90 years of they here in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen if you're turning your Bibles to the book of Ephesians a second chapter we're going to read a Amen very familiar scripture to you Ephesians 2 then we're saying brother Branham said that we don't want to just come to talk about the message isn't that true and and and and and we can all do it we love to talk about the message I mean we love to talk about the various things that we've heard or learned down through the years about the message but that's not enough man he said we must come together to get into it and it's not just a theological discussion and it's not just a history now the reason it's reason amen for many of our young people that amen they they struggle with the message is because it hasn't been made alive yet to them and then it's not a theology it's not a theological discussion this is a living reality or it's not the truth if this message I will just make a challenge if this message cannot deliver you it's the wrong one if this message cannot produce sons and daughters of God it's the wrong message but I'll tell you Satan's come too late to say that it doesn't carve out sons and daughters of God how many say men amen so we've come to get into the message because that message is Christ amen he's the word amen let's go to Ephesians to the first verse you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lusts of our flesh a man and I and I believe that if we should underline that word all there's nobody been exempt from walking according to the lusts of the flesh and that knowledge in itself ought to bring a humility into your life god amen before Amen we can recognize the divinity of God we've got to recognize our humanity in order that the divinity of God can come and move in our humanity amen amen and he said among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God oh I love that but God you have a question tonight you have a you an injunction in your life but God who is rich say he's rich who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you are saved and has raised us up together and has made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated this evening I want to take a thought as the Lord latest on my heart for the first service I want to title this we are God's workmanship we are God's workmanship and we know that the book of Ephesians a man is the book of Joshua of the Old Testament and as a prophet told that he says Redemption has two different parts is that right one of the parts is to come out of amen and there's many and then we could all rejoice about coming out we can rejoice about amen the blood has been applied amen and the Lord has delivered us out of darkness and then he's brought us out of Egypt we can rejoice a man at the message of the Cross can you say man we can rejoice Amen that he shed his blood he paid the price Haman the debt has been covered and has been paid we can rejoice in that but that's not all of it because amen it's coming out but there's also Amen you have to go in I mean you cannot be in limbo you cannot dwell in the middle you have to go all the way with him this is not a halfway gospel neither is this a halfway house and God doesn't make halfway Christians neither does he make halfway young people that Amen don't know how to serve the Lord let me tell you we don't have to Amen water down the message in order for you to understand it neither do we have to weaken its power so that we can cater to your youth amen you're very capable this evening of understanding the riches and the depths of the grace of God and then we don't have to entertain you in order to attract you amen God doesn't have to do that amen I mean if our young people can go into the depths of Satan and they can be wrapped up at a young age and alcohol and drugs and get pulled into all kinds of immorality how much more can God take you into the riches and the depths of Jesus Christ and I want you to know that's not just his goal that's his prophecy and it's not just his prophecy he's bringing it to pass but he's got to bring it to pass through somebody raised the name of the Lord hey man so you've got to come out of the world to enter into Christ you can't remain in the world and say that I'm in Christ that's why we have a lot of miserable Christians they've never fully been delivered from the lusts of the flesh amen they may they may be theologically right but amen there's not a delivering power in their life yet for them to recognize amen not just the symbols of the message but the reality of the message to really have genuine faith the Prophet said you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the Word of God behind in order to enter into faith leaving behind everything means you have to leave behind your reason you have to leave behind your imaginations you have to leave behind your fantasies you have to leave behind anything Amen that the mind would exalt itself over the Word of God you have to leave it totally behind ami when the Bible said that Abraham staggered not at the present at the at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving praise to God who in considered not his own body a man do you understand that statement that he did not consider his body brother Branham said his body never even entered in to his understanding now when we can get to that kind of place where we have not put our body before the words but we've put the word before the body or begin to find out what deliverance is all about amen and it's not enough to know the will of God God amen Satan will tell you amen yes amen excuse me let me just say it again it's not enough to believe Amen that God can deliver you it's not enough Satan would say yes it's true God can deliver you but it's not for you so you've got to not only know that that power is there but it's the will of God to deliver you by that power how many believe that we serve a powerful God tonight so just bear with me as I read this he said the book of the Ephesians of the Old Testament was Joshua where Moses represented the law it couldn't save anyone amen but grace could and Josh was the same word like Jesus Jehovah Savior and now then we have found that we have come to another Ephesians another Ephesus now we're in our intellectual denominations and so forth thank you my brother and all of our educational programs have come to their Jordan I mean let's not just leave that back there Amen with with Amen the organizations of brother bantams time we understand there was not not message churches formed outside of Jeffersonville Amen that believed Amen what Miliband was preaching but there was no message Church formed now he's saying to those organizations we must leave Amen on organizational ideas we must leave our educational programs well amen we still must believe the same thing today amen the educational programs have come to its Jordan we cannot educate you into this message education will not produce it we have to have an exodus to come out and go into the rapture now the Bible says that we are his workmanship right now revelations once said he has made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever he hath made us there are certain truths that we need to emphasize and young people I wanted to say this to you no doubt Amen through the course of these meetings you're going to hear things a man about what you should and and and what you need to avoid and and those things just come in in the course of the preaching of the word even before before any of that has ever said I want you I want to emphasize something to you that God has made us kings and priests and there's no way that I can educate you into that amen there's no way I can rightfully explain it to you it must come by a supernatural experience with God that burns out all the doubt in your life until you know Amen that you have met the person of Jesus Christ and the person was not a doctrine that was preached to you but the person was the reality of a Living God and a supernatural presence are you with me hey man he's just just let me read these things and lay may this foundation I pray you bear with me I know my accent amen is the right one amen and yours is the wrong one he knows like one guy was driving down the road one day they're all the traffic was coming straight at him he called home he says mama everybody's driving the wrong direction hey man well I guess I'm probably the only one here with the wrong accent so I just I hope you can bear with me in my head he hath made us there's certain truths we need to emphasize he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord it is all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are kings we are spiritual kings we will be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but right now and I want you to say that with me right now say it again right now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1:13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom rate of his dear son right now right now the believer reigns with Christ having dominion over sin over flesh over the world and over the devil right now every believer in this room is in Dominion is in dominion over the devil now of course the devil is not going to want you to know this and he's going to tell you that what brother Danny is saying is getting so far out of your reach you have went too far you've done too much you've you're trapped listen we can have young people here you look godly you look pure but you can be in a trap in your mind a fantasy that keeps you going back to the same dark places and hold you in a place of shame and fear and you're not on you're unable to open up yourself and maybe I'm talking to some of the older ones back there you're unable to open up and aim it and be free to say amen amen I have this thing in my life that's helped me in this place and God wants to sell you tonight everything I say about this I'm not hoping that it will happen to you I don't have new thoughts I don't have new thoughts my blueprints are not pieces of paper like yours my thoughts are real and I dwell with them my thoughts becomes words and those words may linger on the earth but those words then become flesh and everything I've said about you young people and in this message is for every generation and every generation has their chance at the revival of God Amon and you have your chance this evening and I want to tell you don't miss your opportunity for what I'm telling you is not out of reach this is your gospel this is your Jesus Christ this is your deliverance this is your our God set this up God orchestrated this camp God pre-planned your life God knew you would set here and he said it's not out of your reach you with me and I'm yelling too loud for you Amen well I found out the devil has heart hearing sometimes you got to lift your voice a little bit huh well I want him to know his rights he don't have any he has no right over these children he has no right to hold families in bondage he's here to deliver the parents he's here to set them free that they can be the examples that they need to be for their children are you with me well I told the Lord I was gonna be quiet and stately didn't work well with the help of the Lord I want to I want to speak words that will increase your faith I mean this is the opening service we won't say that amen that Amen that your opportunity won't come in the next services Amen but why not just make it this one why not make this your night when Jesus was here Jesus said believe me for the very works sake you know there was a lot of there was a lot of misunderstanding about the Lord's life there are misconceptions of where he was from even his mother's testimony marry a man didn't coincide she had first said that this baby was of the Holy Ghost and then she called Joseph his father when he was 12 years old in a time of stress there was confusion about him the priest a man didn't believe in him they said no prophet rises out of Galilee even but Jesus says you can't believe me believe me for the works sake for the works amen that he did be putting he put emphasis enough this has not works a man of amen in another sense where we just try to do works to please God and we're just even out there doing work after work after work this is not the works that he's talking about he's talking about the very expression of his life amen the very the very character that they are seen on display he said amen he put his illnesses on that I can only do that which my father has showed me I am constrained Amen by the will of my father and then no doubt he could have done more Amen when it come to divine healing he could have healed more crowds he could have showed more but he was constrained by the will of the Father even when he went to the pool of Siloam amen he bypassed much worse case and he went to one to ask him his question what do you want because he was constrained it was the will of the Father that led him to that place and so he emphasized that because the works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him and that's the kind of works we want the works that will inspire faith in God it was a great part of his ministry that His Holy Spirit in the Apostle Paul said we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen these works that are in a believers life are to inspire faith in God as they would show forth that relationship to God that Paul described created in him so I want to maybe take your mind in a direction that works that God is ordained for us to do he may never have ordained you amen to lay hands on the sick and they would recover you say brother Danny that's the promise of the scripture absolutely is a member in your walk amen sometimes and then people get discouraged Florence - carrying - a brother band said for the man am I prayed and prayed and I prayed and I prayed Amen I still can't cast out Devils and brother BAM said because that's not your job your job is not to cast out Devils your job is to pray you understand so God has inspired works that would raise up in your life that would show the relationship of God as related to you and it would be no doubt about it that it was God and it wasn't your works because we know there's works that Damon the Bible said Amen Lord I've done many wonderful works in your name and he said depart from me I never knew you is that true but there's a works that inspire faith in God and that's the ones we want to talk about amen when it what it means to be in Christ is this a mean that when you are created and new in Christ Jesus it is impossible for God to condemn that creation Amen no matter how much you want to you can't do it yourself you can't even do it yourself tonight you may be attracted by the words I speak you may be stirred by the words I speak but unless God is doing the falling and God is doing the drawing you will never change but go back to the same lifestyles and the same habits that you've been in before you came but made God's wrong you he says you can't do it it's a gift of God so I want to tell you I mean when that draw begins on your heart understand God gave that to you it's the most precious thing and don't miss that opportunity of that giving he said and all that comes to me he says no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me I'll give him everlasting life and will raise him up at the last day and when God has borne you anew by the Holy Spirit he can only look upon you as a perfect work because he did it himself so when God now let's just go back to that again when God looks upon you and you're born of his spirit even he can only look upon you as a perfect work because he did it himself and he cannot condemn you for you are his workmanship this wouldn't mean this is what it means to be his workmanship I don't want to be identified as a message class or our message brand I want to be identified as his workmanship there's there's all sorts no doubt of flavors in this room right now you come from all kinds of different brands on all kinds of different flavors amen I do too no doubt our backgrounds have something to do with it but we can't help where we came from we can't help what we come out of but we can help what we do tonight Amen so he said Amen I presented you through the blood and there is nothing wrong with my work you are God's workmanship now I just want to to give you a little bit of advice and that is young people if you want to get anything from God be real don't watch how somebody else cried don't watch how somebody else repented you be real before God and you come to God and say Lord just as I am without one plea be real be what God made you to be and don't put on something for the benefit of anybody else in here don't come if you're gonna come to the altar don't come because your mom wants you to don't come for any other reason but that God has drawed you is that Alright come to him as you are and let him make the difference in your life here's a statement in Christ the mystery of God revealed that he said many people have the wrong conception it has never been God's idea to convert people to Christianity and to its government we make converts to Christianity how many people have we baptized and they started in the work amen and after a while out they go why because sometimes they're just converts to your church their converts to the fellowship their converts to Christianity and then they're governed by the church they're governed by the rules in the church somebody help me but that's not his thought are you saying brother Danny are you saying there are not to be any rules you're gonna come treat here and try to smash the churches that's not what I'm saying but what I'm saying it's not God's thought his thought is amen that it comes not by a government but by a revelation Christ in you as God was in Christ Christ in you as God was in Christ what God did in Christ Christ does in you what a beautiful thought so I want you to know something at the beginning of these meetings I want you understand something clearly this is message is not a message of do's and don'ts did I offend you I said this message is not a message of do's and don'ts well what do we do with the do's and don'ts brother Danny we make it a message of do's and don'ts we make it a message of you have to do this and ya can't do that but what this message is it's a message of obedience can I say it again it's not a message of do's and don'ts it's a message of obedience what's the difference brother Danny the difference is it's not a obedience born out of fear of retribution and anger towards you amen not being obedient because if we fear that if we do wrong we're not be forgiving and will not be forsaken but your obedience to God must be born out of love and it must be born out of trust how many marriages went off the rails because it was a marriage of do's and don'ts a man and when we do that we begin to pull them away from the Christ that can change that Amen God is calling us to a life of obedience and a life of Trustee how many times did we hear brother Branham say payment drinking's not a cent smoking's not a sin adultery is not a sin then they said well pray tell me brother Branham what is a sin he said unbelief he said you do those things because you don't believe and if you say you believe and you're doing those things the message is just a message of do's and don'ts God wants to take it far beyond that to a life of trusting and we could never realize Amen that we love God and we could never love God unless we first realize that he loved us and I want you to I want to understand when we talk about feeling the presence of God that's in this room it's not an impersonal presence and it's numb but not somebody that standoffish I mean it's not a creator he said that created and folded his arms and stood back to watch what his creation would do somebody help me he's not send him back here tonight saying I wonder Amen what these young people are going to do tonight are they going to respond to Danny's voice or are they I hope they get enthused about it I mean look at them some of them are looking around now to see who else is looking around what's going on he's not standing back like this in fact brother branham said his very existence is for his old he exists Amen to live and to work he is right now the shepherd of his sheep is right now here to sustain you and to comfort you and to tell you you begin to believe what you're listening to because that thing you're going through is not more powerful than my word it may be a strong man that's got a hold of you but there's a stronger one and I say man glory we can all worship a Great Creator hey man but he wants you to know he's existing for you hey man Brande he existed for you he existed so he could deliver you from drugs that's his very reason of living he existed so you could write a testimony and ask everybody around the world if they wanted it isn't that true he exists so you can be here he's the god of our existence glory so his he is working faithfully among you right now as the great Shepherd of the sheep and his very existence is for you I want to say this everybody that's called of God everybody that's called of God has the ability to trust and obey it's not something hard for me to trust my wife Amen everybody has the ability in here tonight to trust and obey you read many scriptures that call for obedience you said brother Danny what is the difference between obedience and do's and dont's love God would tell Israel if you're obedient to the word they would eat to go to the land god never lets obedience go unrewarded so if he's calling you tonight let me tell you be obedient to that because you're not being obedient to me you're being obedient to the call so he never lets obedience go unrewarded but he is not rewarding you because he's proud of you he's not rewarding you because you've been a good person but you're rewarded because that's where obedience led you to obedience led you to the promise because he always gives a promise and he never reneged on the promise amen amen and the promise is the reward obedience leads to greater things the word that God has given us is designed amen to bring forth and more than what you see on the surface why because the Bible says the word is a seed seeds are much more than that little form that you have how many planted garden right there much more than the little form that comes from the fruit that it comes from the seed properly cultivated would bring forth reward after reward after reward it would bring forth what it had the potential to bring forth I could lay a seed up here of a vegetable I could lay a seat up here of a fruit I could lay up here in a corn of an oak tree and it would ever be enough to feed myself alone let alone everybody amen but properly cultivated that seed will bring forth food for much more than myself it'll keep producing seeds all along are you with me but if the seed lays in a place where it cannot be cultivated it will not work it will be powerless there will be no strength in it to sustain you that's why people walked away from the message the word they had was only in a seed fog did they have the word they had the word but it was only in his seed form and it wasn't cultivated by the Holy Ghost I could lay an acorn up right up here on this this pulpit right now and it would never provide shade for me I could quote it service after service and it would never be a benefit to me unless Amen I put it in a place where it could come forth Amen no matter how long I preach it it has to be planted and then there has to be patience for it to develop and to grow but once placed in its proper condition it will provide shade for generations and keep dropping acorns come on but where did it start amen everybody wants God aiming to come along and say Lord I want this I want a house I want a table I want to try want this God says I give you trees you could be under a tree all your life and ask God to give you things and be disappointed because you never got what you asked for now if you look around you see I look out the window I know you wanted to God still in the business of giving Therese well what who makes the table who builds the house who forms things with their hands are you with me a man I could ask God to give me a pulpit and God said I gave you a tree well God what good does that do me wake up pulpit God wants amen that investment of that seed to come back to him more than way he presented it to you Amen young people when he presented you the books and he presented you the tapes he didn't presented to you to say I got a tree those things are given to you amen to form sons and daughters of God glory you know God never gave Israel the tabernacle and the wilderness to them he didn't he gave him the pattern he gave him the pattern but among the children of Israel were men that would cause this heavenly vision to become on earth the talent was already in the men to make that heavenly vision become something earthly that could bless generations and young people I don't know how to tell you I want to walk down there but I'm scared too Moses ain't the one that built the tabernacle I said Moses is not the one that built the tabernacle he was the one God gave the pattern to amen and then God came to Moses and said Moses there's two men in your congregation Bezalel and I don't even know if I said that right no holy AAB you know I'm glad I didn't live back there dad well you know what if I lived there and I had that name been happy with it but anyway amen amen but it's hard to pronounce them now amen and he said yeah I've got two men among you that I put a spirit of wisdom and of knowledge on in them there's a talent in there and you know what that talent was never discovered in Egypt because as long as they were slaves Amen that seed could never be cultivated but God said I got him get him out of Egypt and God is here tonight to get you out of Egypt he's here to get you out of that slave hood and the slave mentality that I can't break these chains I'll tell you you don't have to break the chains God is already broken them but he wants you to know he's got more people in here to make this message live amen we don't have to look on the internet for facts this is a vindication this is the promise of God come on somebody help me young people god amen your event you're here till you say well hey well how many you girls want a boyfriend I didn't know that was funny about you boys please don't look at me brother Danny well you ain't natural if you don't why didn't you laugh at that well it's in you God placed it there God put something in you a desire that would lead you to something I mean but before he could ever lead you to that for the right person and the right life and everything he wants you to know beyond all that relationship could ever give you I got something for you that I have commanded the husband and wife amen to be benevolent to one another but I would never give them a commandment that I would not keep for myself somebody helped me as the husband is commanded to give benevolence to the wife our great husband said I'll come down and sustain you you need somebody to love you let him love you let God be your husband he said well Danny I'm not very attractive and I'm primary this Wow well look at me I got married you know things happen I didn't always used to look like this I was slim but I was still bowlegged you know what uglies not all it's supposed to you know it's not that bad your brother Danny but I'm ugly nobody lesson we don't worry God's got a lot of ugly person that'll love you quit fantasizing imagining yourself in a place that you can never move beyond amen you have one amen amen who is the beauty and the desire of all nations you got one is called the Rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley and the bright morning star his love is more than enough you want that kind of love you want to love that a sustained yin your schoolwork you want a love that'll cost you to walk away from temptation what manner of love is this that's the love that's in the room Oh hallelujah that's the one that's here and if I I don't know it's beyond my human ability to present that to you well it's somewhere on my stumbling around and and moving up and down and everything and my personality if Grodd can speak through that and just quick in that heart for just a moment I want you to seize upon that impulse a man you don't sure a god that's far off when I say Amen a god that's far if you serve a God that is willing to forgive and when he's willing to forgive he don't put you on probation he's so willing to forgive a God who is omniscient will say I'll never remember it anymore did you hear me he's the only one that has the ability to forget something that'll never come back to this line again now the devil would tell you you're not much you don't have much lot in life when neither did bezalel and oholiab i mean they were slaves they were down in Egypt they were mud daubers hey man and here's Pharaoh he looks out the window and he sees no potential in them look at these they are they even interested what are they doing here I mean why in the world did we have to come to a camp and suffer through all these meetings is this even gonna work they're mud daubers they're slaves there's no value in them amen but to do what I tell them to do that's truly the do's and don'ts now the Prophet said Moses looked out of the same window and he never saw slaves even that's what a prophet comes for he comes with a different vision to give you a different eyesight to give you a different outlook in your life they said I don't see a mud dauber I see children to have a promise hey man there's not one of you in here that God hasn't promised something to why don't you remind me brother Danny well let me remind you then I meant for this day man well I'm almost 15 bring it back Lord all right repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall be filled with the Holy Ghost for this promise is unto you and unto your children and to those that are far for for for me it was far far off and he said that promises to them Danny go remind them I have made them a promise I'm well aware the devil has made you a lot of promises well you're a beautiful girl you got you can go into fashion and you go to this and you can go far in your life you can have an ambition you can do this and you can do that he's made you a lot of promises he can't keep one of them here's a car that's never broke one promise come on he told you he'd give me the Holy Ghost he'll never go back on that promise and he sees in you the potential to be a witness aiming of the heavenly vision that will become an earthly manifestation somebody help me deceive me you are the ones what in the world what in the world what the part that I have to play I didn't know until the words spoke to me the first time I ever heard of bezel EO and the holy of is when God's pointed him out but they had to come out of Egypt come on if you want to if you're gonna get something from God come out of Egypt don't sit back there with the garlic's and the leeks and say I'm gonna serve God from this position it'll never work a minute don't work to be a raven in the message you have to be a dove he has to be led by the W out of a died of a dove even you're gonna have the cleansing of the Gulf are you with me God didn't call you to manifest him in some earthly ambition maybe he said what brother Danny I got a live you exactly right you got to live but be like Elijah him and he thought his life was to be a plowing on us on his father's house in his father's farm and it was his ambition aim it and he plowed straight roads he was a good farmer and he had a big plow and a lot of horses he was good at it what do you he likes you I'm a farmer I'm a good one watch this watch it look at him horses now I can control him watch hey I come from that background too I know what it is to plow a straight road or at least my generations did and a lot of ancestors knew how to plow Mennonite and Amish and they still know how to plow poor people without tractors he likes you thought that was his I ambition it's a good job it's a good calling but on the other side there's a man and been laid in a cave full of doubts thinking he's the only one that believes the message it's a very intense hour a very dangerous time Jezebel spirit is on the move trying to stamp out this rebellion called the message and Elijah is complaining to God I'm the only one there's left God said you don't even know what's just started alone you don't even know what's just started I got 7000 you didn't even know about Elijah you might have thought in your own mind Elijah it was over after 77 but look here hey man come on now look here I mean they didn't even come then they weren't even born then somebody helped me God had to wait because he knew he had a seed that would not bow to the idols of bale hey man well or do you mean I got more work to do yes sir you're gonna ride this trail again hey man I don't want you as you ride this trail I want you to go and knowing it Elijah in your place in your room who's Elijah well he has a good plowing business you'll find him got the biggest sign in the city good plow for hire amen hey man you may be good at what you're doing I mean but that's not the talent God gave you that's your talent there's more talent than that there's a gift and a calling him in its place there without repentance that God wants to awaken in your life glory I want you to go knowing Elijah be a prophet in your room amen go anoint Hazael king of Judah a king of Syria go anoint Jehu to be king well he had a new commission I'm gonna ride this trail again glory and all he got to do was go by that plowing business may God come by your plowing business this evening believe he's just stopped right at your furrow did I say that right here in new zoo furrow glory he came right by your firm he didn't speak any language he wants to he knows how to speak your language you decide to get your attention he stopped right at his furrow and he called him he called him the Prophet the word of the hour called him she went by by just taking the mantle and throwing it at him and Elijah immediately knew that God was calling him a man and Elijah rose up out of his seat and he said you know what I'm gonna make this a business I can't come back to if I'm gonna give myself to this Elijah's mantle I'm gonna give all my energy and I'm gonna give all my strength because I know a man it's a holy calling and a holy desire what he didn't know yet that he was supposed to be part of that vision that Elijah thought he was riding the trail on come on now amen but when a man with a prophets word and a believer begin to sink and set together it becomes one in the same marching in step with the gospel may you begin to come into sync this evening if it needs to be started with the song of repentance I surrender all why don't you begin to say I surrender all why don't you just begin to do that Elijah because you are God's workmanship your life is meant to inspire faith in God you are somebody there not some beat down little somebody as a prophet said Satan's trying to hide it from you who you are trying to keep the way back somewhere from the glorious revelation of God says you're just some beat downtrodden sinner that'll never be able to be free you know we got some real dark things going on in this hour maybe you're trapped you know see our world has expanded greatly in just a short time technology has exploded - your mind cannot keep up with it and it's creating an uneasiness and the people of this time in their spirits it's all trouble because things are happening so fast that the human mind can't comprehend how fast these things are coming upon us and it causes a troubling in their spirit we don't know what it is there's a fear of the future upon the people and they don't even know I mean that's because judgments hanging and coming they don't have to be the position of the people of God come on God's calling to the Elijah's and I don't care how much him in stock you've put in your own ability in your own talents amen your talents is lesser when it comes to God Elijah had to drop the lesser to pick up the better you too this evening made God a man speak to your heart just now and say God I'm willing to drop him in my ambitions in order amen to pick up the better called word of god the mantle of Elijah are you with me you know Eli cement business she realized if I want to be in that calling I'm gonna walk it with all my energy there's not anybody in this room that's not made out of the same material how many times we heard brother branham say TAS him calcium potash just things thrown together and he never said potassium calcium potash and aluminum ain't no ain't no robots in here everybody's made out of the same material whether random said Amen if you're going to get in the race you got to know what why you're running that race man it's not just coming up and showing up in a message Church and filling out your time and going back said I did my duty Lord Here I am receive what I give to you know you got to know why you're running the race and then if you're gonna run it you got to run it well I want to run away I want to finish it well you got to run well glory the BAM said one time he said I'm setting my home he said got a knock on the door here's a here's Obama hope oh hey me the professional Amen hobo made his they just just wondering where ever he goes and he come in and wanted a sandwich so they brought him in the house and him in they sit down made him a big sandwich and brother BAM said I began to talk to him and said hey man where are you gone he says nowhere what do you do nothing I'm young people who got in here like that they just don't know where their life's gone there's nothing pointing to him god wants to point it to see me what are you what are you doing in your life he nothing other man said he had no no ambitions no ambitions to better himself he said it puts me in mind a men of a lot of Christians he were all made of the same material he says you go out on the river he said you see these boats go up and down move around all made out of woods they're moving and they've been shaped he said but then alongside the rivers and stuff and sometimes floating down the middle through the rapids there's there's driftwood just going along and they get piled up in every kind of trash that comes along coltan the corners of the flow caught here caught there but they're both made out of the same material but the one has been shaped by a master a master craftmens come along and took that wood and shaped it into the boat and not only did he shape a boat but he put a power behind it and if that boat could move and go and it wouldn't get stuck in a place but there'd be a power that would push it come on amen God wants to be the power behind your life he wants to shape your life and you won't be the driftwood that's caught up in every bit of trash you want some power behind your life to push you out of it you may go into the same trash pile that the driftwood do but there's a power there then I'll push it through it glory to God that power is what's here this evening do you ask him to shape your life here shape it amen how many want to say God I want you to shape my life this evening I want you to be the power behind me that'll move me and give me the ambition that I have need of you are God's workmanship oh hey man the devil wants to be the one to fashion your life girl Satan wants to be your designer you've heard brother branham say that Amen that Satan is the woman's designer the unbeliever and the uninformed grab ahold of that and say all my look what he's saying there no it's what it exactly what it means Satan without all these designs for the women to catch sons of God that's why the branch of the Lord in this hour he said will be glorious that I'll have young ladies Haiming that are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ neither are they ashamed for it to be on display before the world him in there like bezalel and oholiab they came out of Egypt and then they were called to make a stand any men in that heavenly pattern became an earthly man by manifestation come on church God said amen he said I'd be record in heaven I have a bride without spot without wrinkle aim it shitty perfect shimmy blameless she'll be a house fire don't you want a husband like that tell you how beautiful you are every morning every evening you come in you're feeling all wore out leavings at all your perfect there is no spot in you at all glory I'm sorry if I'm making myself look forged but it's good hey man I love the Lord because I know what he's done for me and I know he won't stop Haven he that began a good work to me he's able to finish it come on how many young ladies want to be any Lysa this evening I'm ready to drop my plows of ambition and pick up the greater things of the word how many young men maybe the devil is tempting you just now and he's pulling you into the things of the world and it's a and it's a force it's a force you can't bring but I want to tell you there's a greater force that'll break every chain break every chain break every chain how do you know that brother Danny brother branham said here I was standing and I looked and I saw a prison house a man and here it was great big thick bars and people behind there with great cancers hanging over their eyes they can't see any promise of God and there's no way for them to break out of that prison house their cry help us brother branham help us brother branham who is brother Branham brother Branham even is a vindicated prophet of God whom the word comes to so he stands there as a representative of the message of the hour that message is still speaking brother branham has left the scene but that message is in my mouth tonight and it could be in your mouth when you take it up in yourself brother Bentham amen look to Ted he said oh my I can't break those bars hey Ben somebody old brother Brennan this is a house of hell and he said then I saw a light flicker whoa let me tell you children of God that same light is in this room you don't have to see it to

way to the name of Jesus Christ hey many said the bars begin to break that people begin to run free and they begin to scream I'm deliver I'm delivered I'm delivered why don't you let that vision come from a dream come from a vision and coming to your mouth and you say the same thing I am delivered one more thing how long will it take for you to be delivered how long will it take for you to be forgiven if you're student of the message I highly recommend you to do it this is our problem and too many of our young people too many of our older people are too busy and other things to know what the prophets said and do it know what the message the hours even meaning anymore you're too willing to get on the internet and to research what somebody else said about it instead of going right to the fountain there's a fountain open in the house of David you don't have to go to some imposter to find out what a true prophet says you can go yourself to the Word of God every one of you got the ability to go there and begin to look and begin to dig and say god I'm honest this evening I I want to see what's in that word and I want to know what you're telling me will you speak to me out of these pages I believe it's more than a man I don't believe brother Branham could cunningly device this fable hey mean this is not a myth this was not a man just Amen you came too late to tell me that
