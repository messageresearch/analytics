[0:11] The day is hot. The streets are packed.
[0:14] [music and singing]
[0:15] The sun is blazing down. Their hearts
[0:18] are gone so cold. I see him limping.
[0:21] [singing] Dragging [music] this weight
[0:23] that ain't his. The people look his way.
[0:26] But no one sees what I see. [music]
[0:29] Those eyes. [singing] Oh, those eyes.
[0:33] That's when it hits. It's all for me.
[0:38] He's carrying my shame. [music] He's
[0:41] carrying my blame. Crushed beneath
[0:44] [singing] the burden, but he still takes
[0:46] the pain. I stand here and cry while he
[0:50] [singing] bleeds for [music] me.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, the mercy in his [singing] eyes that
[0:56] sets [music] the captives free.
[0:59] He stumbles [singing]
[1:01] and shakes. [music] Still moving,
[1:06] still bleeding.
[1:08] And me [singing] I follow
[1:12] silent [music] while they throw their
[1:15] hay [singing] like stones. We reach the
[1:17] hill.
[1:18] Gotha. [singing]
[1:21] They [music] throw him on the wood like
[1:23] a criminal.
[1:25] But he's [music] not. [singing] He's
[1:28] not.
[1:29] He's not. He's the son of God.
[1:37] Nails to healing hands. A crown [music]
[1:39] of thorns adore.
[1:41] The sky breaks open crying. The veil of
[1:44] grace is torn. Thunder shakes the
[1:47] [singing] earth. And darkness [music]
[1:49] falls like storm.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; But even in the [singing and music]
[1:54] silence, I know I'm not alone. Holy.
[2:04] Oh, whisper,
[2:06] "It [music and singing] is finished."
[2:09] So quiet
[2:11] you could [music and singing] miss it.
[2:13] Oh, whisper, "It is finished." [music]
[2:17] So [singing] quiet you could miss it.
[2:22] Oh, whisper, [singing] "It is finished."
[2:24] [music]
[2:26] So quiet
[2:28] you can miss it. And just [music] like
[2:31] that, no wind, no breath, no life, just
[2:35] a miraculous fight. [singing]
[2:42] But you feel [music] the [singing]
[2:43] stillness that wait in the path
[2:47] between death and a miracle's cause. The
[2:51] story ain't [singing] over. This grave
[2:54] won't hold the sun.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Hope is just beginning. The story end.
[3:05] [music]
[3:08] &gt;&gt; The story [singing] end.
[3:17] The story end. [music and singing]
[3:21] [applause]
