[0:02] so much
[0:04] uh
[0:05] it reminds me of our home amen
[0:09] so this song
[0:11] i've sang it before but i'll sing it
[0:13] again in a different tune
[0:16] and hoping that it will bless you
[0:21] just imagine if
[0:25] imagine if for you to go to heaven
[0:27] was upon someone here on earth
[0:32] and
[0:33] many of us wouldn't make it just imagine
[0:36] because god is a just god
[0:39] he he made it very clear that it will be
[0:41] him who decides
[0:43] so you must i'm very thankful this
[0:46] morning that um
[0:47] there's going to be a day when time is
[0:49] normal
[0:50] and that day
[0:52] you know you know we are taught that
[0:55] they're going they're going to read the
[0:56] roles to read your name there on that
[0:59] role on that morning you know
[1:02] the prophet says we're going to be
[1:03] surprised one day that ah even this guy
[1:06] made it
[1:07] [Laughter]
[1:09] so when that role is called up yonder so
[1:12] i'll be there you will be there
[1:14] so that's why i want to remind you this
[1:16] morning that there's coming a day when
[1:18] the roles are going to be read
[1:20] and when you are going to hear your name
[1:23] so the song goes like
[1:25] when the trumpet of the lord shall sound
[1:29] and time shall be no more
[1:32] and the morning breaks eternal bright
[1:35] and fair
[1:38] when they saved on earth shall gather on
[1:41] their
[1:42] other show
[1:44] and the role is called a beyond i'll be
[1:47] there
[1:50] when they're wrong
[1:52] it's called a beyond
[1:54] [Music]
[1:56] when the road
[1:58] is called a beyond
[2:02] when the road
[2:04] is called
[2:07] [Music]
[2:09] when the roll is colder beyond our all
[2:12] be there
[2:15] on that bright and cloudless morning
[2:17] when the death in christ shall rise and
[2:21] the glory of his resurrection
[2:26] when his chosen ones shall gather to
[2:29] their home beyond the sky
[2:32] and their role is called a beyond i'll
[2:35] be there
[2:37] when the rock
[2:40] is colder beyond
[2:43] when the road
[2:45] is
[2:51] is colder beyond
[2:55] when the road is cold and beyond i'll be
[2:58] there you will be there brother and
[3:00] sister let us lay before the master from
[3:04] the dawn till certain sun
[3:06] let us tell of his wondrous love and
[3:09] care
[3:11] then when all of life is over and our
[3:15] work on it is done
[3:17] and the role is called beyond i'll be
[3:20] there
[3:22] when the
[3:24] role is called and beyond
[3:28] when the road
[3:30] is that beyond that when the road
[3:35] is colder beyond that
