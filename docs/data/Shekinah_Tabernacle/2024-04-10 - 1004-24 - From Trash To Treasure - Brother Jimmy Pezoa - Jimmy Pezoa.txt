brother George What atmosphere amen amen I was um quite worried there at the back like always but when I I was there and I start feeling the presence of the Lord amen he is here so I'm going to be helped by him so am amen so we can open our Bibles in um First Corinthians chapter 1 verse um 28 oh no 26 sorry the Bible say says um for ye see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base thing of the world and things which are despised have God chosen chosen ye and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence yeah but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according at is written he that glor let him glory in the Lord amen amen may the Lord bless his word you may have you it amen the Lord put this thought in my heart and I wanted to speak about this from Trash to Treasure amen hallelujah and that's something that only God can do take a piece of ravish and make it something something beautiful am amen AMJ I have here an example who's this boy King David amen the Bible says that okay just let's go the Bible says that Samuel the prophet he was the Lord talked to him and said to him now go to the house of Jessi because there is a king in that house and what Jessi did he sent the king with a sheep yeah why because for the human it's just so easy to judge the book by the cover and I can can imagine the preparation in that house man the prophet of God is coming to this house I can imagine the the big brother getting dressed hey Daddy do I look like a king yes you look like a can brother impo if that would be your case would have you sent FY away good of you I trust that wouldn't be the case what about ID what if you sent Daniel away okay this story has a happy ending but in that house it was a preparation cuz someone was going to be anointed to become a King Jesus Hallelujah but David he was there with the lamb said I can't just imagine that sad story saying hey Daddy am I not going to stay here no no no no you you go away you go with your ship wow man w why because I think the Lord was working in David's life David David was a very humble man but in order to do that he he had to have like a different path in his life amen now David he was always playing his heart and I had a little bit of that uh country life when I was um doing daily farming when you take your Lambs or cows or whatever to feed that's all what you do because they just have to eat but what do you do you just have to wait so I can see David just playing his H for hours and throwing stones with his slingshot now those two hobbies that were going to be really important for the Kingdom of Israel yes sir the king he was going to be like how do you say tormented by a bad spirit and he needed a man that could be able to play the harp but not just play the harp Saul said a man that can play very well the harp that was David amen hours and hours playing his instrument the Lord preparing him yeah true and then we all know the story about the harp I mean like about the stone yeah he was very very good Throne stones that boy but also he had to take care of his um sheep and I can see him one day just counting them saying Oh yeah Dorothy Peter Sean where's sea and there's sea with a lion and he killed the lion another day Dorothy Peter Sean with the bear and he kill the bear that character that was getting formed in David man but now when the prophet of God went to his house and went to anointed the uh older brother God said to him but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his statue because I have refuse him for the Lord seeth not as a as a man seeth for men lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart what was on the heart of David I'm going to get to that soon amen the key now we have David he was not scared yeah David got anointed by a prophet that told him you are going to be a king amen so now David when he went he didn't go to work he were just to drop a pel but he got in involve there why why he was so brave David has a secret weapon amen he had Revelation from a prophet said you are going to be a king you cannot die amen so this boy if I cannot die I'm going to go and fight amen amen and I'm pretty sure that if we believe the word of God that was spoke through a prophet we can say that we are an invincible Army amen and the story that doesn't finish there you know that David he actually cut the head off the giant yes it wasn't just Stone but the story of David keeps telling us that he was a very humble man even when Soul tried to kill him once twice hips of times he was not going to do anything against Soul because the spirit of the Lord came to David when he was anointed as a king and he couldn't see that the problem was not Soul we are not fighting against flesh we're fighting against spirits and that was the noble things about David that he was not angry with soul he could have killed him he didn't he had the promise of a um Prophet saying you are going to be a king but he didn't took his sword and went to the palace and said now I'm the king he was very humble even when Saul got killed what that's amazing David said to that guy something like how dare you to kill the anointed man of God for David Soul always was something that he respect yes amen now we can see David this is David with um my said how do you how do you say that in English my was this guy was son of Jonathan his friend son of um Soul now in the caral round what would would you do if the son of your enemy is in trouble he could have just killed him I'm going to get rid of your lineage this is it your grandfather was so mean to me on and I'm going to kill you now boy but the heart of David was beautiful and said and David said unto him fear not for I will surely show the kindness of Jonathan thy father's sake and I will restore the all the land of Soul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually and he bowed down and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am like here you can see two very humble people one person saying I'm I'm going to rescue for that place that you were living he was living in lar that was like a ghetto back in the days and I'm going to give you land you're going to eat in my in my table you're going to sit with me don't you feel like that the king yes s s for him amen hallelujah amen that's right thank you Lord now what what I can what I want to say here is like we have received a prophecy from the Lord saying that we must to be [Music] humble and that's David man he was very humble we can go now to Roman oh you can read that to Roman Romans 9 UM verse 21 says hath not the poter power over the clay of the same lamp to make one vessel unto Anna and another unto this Anna what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endureth with much longsuffering The Vessel of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessel of Mercy amen which he had AF for prepare unto Glory even as whom he had called not not of the Jew Jews only but also of the Gentiles as he saith also in I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God Amen thank you Father this chapter Romans 8 is just Roman 9 Romans 9 Romans 9 it's very important he's telling you he create kind of a vessel a human you guys yeah and he was going to put all his blessings in you but he was going to create another person that probably they're not here I hope they are not here but they were going call to destruction don't you feel happy that the Lord chose you amen thank you and you didn't do anything amen was just the Lord that is a riching message thank you Father we haven't done anything and that's like the first um scripture that read we haven't done anything so how are we not going to be humble if we haven't done anything for him he just chose us he chooses have he the right attitude that makes a difference we have that guy dressing fancy as a Pharisee and praying saying Lord I'm the best I'm just awesome not like that one man what a way to pray yeah but the other guy how was praying man that guy he was genuine yeah he was very genuine he he wasn't try to make a show of it he had a personal relationship with God I hope you can be like that man I hope you are and we are like that man amen that we are not trying to make a show of of our Christian walk that we can be sincere with him the Lord is know that knows the hearts yes thank you Father amen also here in Romans um 9 verse um 15 said for he said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy for the scripture sayith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose I have raised thee up that I might might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth the Lord create this man to be a pharaoh and Ure his heart to show his power and us we are being created just to receive the mercy of the Lord amen to receive all his blessings amen amen amen amen and amen don't you feel blessed that the Lord of Mercy chose you amen I have no idea for how long I've been here probably not even for 10 minutes but I want to show um tell you a little testimony about my life that's an emergency room in a hospital there was um um one week after I came here my friend invite me to like a PP or something and I went out with them and I drunk and I got high on drugs and whatever and they all left they went to their house or whatever and I was just there alone I could have gone to my house but go going to my parents house minute that I was going to receive a Le pxa oh boy because my parents would not allowed that behavior in their house so I start to think and I said where can I go I went to that emergency room in a hospital cuz it was a like a heat pump or something and I went there and I I think it was like 3:00 in the morning I just wanted to sleep and some homeless people that's are arriving to that place that was a place where the homeless people go to sleep and from one moment to another one I was surrounded just by homeless people and something spoke to my heart and said to me if you don't stop now this is how you going to end up wow wow the Lord already here an appointment with me that plane he was going to have an appointment with me and I'm so happy amen that he had that appointment amen I didn't do anything and I don't deserve to be here but he chose me am and I know that the Lord have chosen you too but in order to receive that we have to really know that we don't deserve anything he just showing his Mercy amen hallelujah and now I can say that the lord gave me a wife give me a beautiful daughter a little handsome little man Hallelujah and man the Monday night I was there with um the youth having the prayer meeting my house was parked with Christian Believers and man like eight or nine years ago I was just surrounded by drug addict people people that drank alcohol and I was like man what a difference you have made in my life Lord hallelujah and probably this is just very personal but I'm happy to share this with you because with who else I can share these things I'm just a very happy person cuz the Lord have changed my life amen and I know that if you are going through something the Lord he can change everything amen cuz you are a vessel that the Lord want to p All His blessings in you doesn't matter what's happening for me to get to this stage that I'm now there was many many years for my parents of praying yeah of praying and they saw like every year I was getting worse and worse and worse and worse but one day man it was just from one day to another day the Lord just changed my life Hallelujah and in order to don't judge a book by its cover I have another testimony that and I'm sorry Pedro but Pedro when he got the revelation of the message he tried to talk to my parents about this he talked to my mom he talked to my dad he talked to my other brother why he didn't share it with me because I was too lost that was that's what the eye the human eye can see but from that family I was the very next one in receive the message wow praise God and receive this Revelation I'm hoping that my family is going to come here and they're going to get the Revelation too of the Lord Jesus Christ but that's what happen when you judge a book by its cover and like we know that we need to find the last one but the last one probably doesn't even look like a Christian person it can be an emergency room like a homeless person it can be like the worst of the worst but the Lord he can take some trash and make it into a treasure amen well that's all what I have for you here let's have the musicians amen can we um can we sing uh evidence again and tonight prayer night that's why yeah was a little condensed sorry but we can stand you you you help
