[6:24] [Applause]
[6:30] praise the lord
[6:36] welcome everyone welcome to the house of
[6:37] the lord i mean it's good to
[6:39] be here again it's good to be an
[6:42] atmosphere where
[6:45] anything can happen and where all things
[6:47] are possible
[6:49] that's what it's like when you're in the
[6:50] presence of god all things are possible
[6:54] regardless of what your situation is or
[6:56] how it might seem or anything like that
[6:59] all things are possible when you're in
[7:00] the presence of god so
[7:02] um we this morning we want to
[7:06] um we want the spirit of god to dwell
[7:09] richly with us
[7:09] you know we don't just want a small
[7:11] amount we want we want an outpouring of
[7:12] the holy ghost
[7:13] and our presence this morning because
[7:15] that's what that's what changes things
[7:17] you know
[7:18] we when you're young you think you're
[7:21] pretty good
[7:22] or most of us did hey that's true if
[7:25] we're honest
[7:26] you know we we rate ourselves you know
[7:29] but
[7:30] and and especially young guys you know
[7:32] they go through this phase where they
[7:33] think they're the strongest thing out
[7:35] the strongest thing that ever existed
[7:37] you know i'm this big strong guy
[7:40] it's all in here though because it's in
[7:42] reality we're not really you know we're
[7:44] when you look at the scale of how big we
[7:45] are and the amount that we can achieve
[7:47] with our
[7:48] physical strength it's minuscule you
[7:50] know
[7:52] absolutely minuscule what what we can do
[7:55] and as you go on you realize i'm just
[7:57] nothing and the the power of god is
[7:59] everything
[7:59] you know that that's what that's what
[8:01] changes things that's what makes things
[8:03] that's what changes our life it's not
[8:04] how much effort i can put in it's how
[8:06] much
[8:07] god puts in and it's how much i
[8:08] surrender to the lord and that the power
[8:10] and the spirit of god
[8:12] work through my life and and do things
[8:13] for me go go before me
[8:15] you know we want the spirit of god to go
[8:17] before us and and and everything that we
[8:19] do we don't just we
[8:21] don't want to be pressing on by
[8:22] ourselves you know we're we're going
[8:23] ahead
[8:24] i don't want to go ahead man i don't
[8:25] know what i'm doing and i'm not and
[8:27] i don't have the ability to change
[8:29] things or to make things work you know
[8:31] we even think about what you know people
[8:34] think they're smart and
[8:35] intelligent and they can work a lot of
[8:36] things at once you know especially
[8:38] business people and that you know they
[8:40] but they're not really they don't they
[8:41] can't they're only controlling this fear
[8:44] that they're in a maybe they're sending
[8:45] a few texts and some emails and
[8:47] controlling a few people they're not
[8:49] controlling the world you know there's a
[8:50] lot there could be
[8:51] they could be thinking everything is
[8:53] fine and they're doing so great in the
[8:54] meantime something could be brewing to
[8:56] destroy everything that they're just
[8:57] trying to
[8:58] work for and they know nothing of it you
[9:00] know but god knows all things so if we
[9:02] want success we want the lord to be in
[9:03] control of all the things that we can't
[9:05] see that we don't know what's going on
[9:06] lord you lead the way you go before me

[52:01] amen amen praise the lord
[52:05] amen you can take your seats this
[52:07] morning
[52:09] um thank you musicians so
[52:13] so i was actually preaching today not
[52:15] not song leading
[52:16] but we just realized um about sorry i'll
[52:19] just blend my nose
[52:23] we realized about 10 o'clock 10 30 last
[52:26] night
[52:27] thanks bro that we were short of a song
[52:28] leader so
[52:32] that was me but um yeah i'm
[52:35] i'm actually preaching this morning so
[52:36] sorry you had to sort of put up with me
[52:38] for a whole session
[52:43] it'd be good because you'll be real sick
[52:45] of me and there'll be no requests for a
[52:46] long time
[52:49] it's a cunning plan amen
[52:52] excuse me i'll just grab this so i've
[52:55] got a very very simple um
[52:57] thought this morning
[53:00] a lot of the times i end up with a
[53:02] little thought and then it
[53:04] compounds to be quite a big thought and
[53:05] i have to rush really fast to get
[53:07] through it
[53:08] but it's not like that today i've
[53:09] honestly got a very simple thought and i
[53:10] can just take my time on this one
[53:11] because it's
[53:13] it's um it's very very simple and it's
[53:15] not something that
[53:16] um i'm reasonably confident it's not
[53:19] something that you won't already know
[53:21] and i i yeah and it's not it's not
[53:23] really a
[53:25] i'm not going to call it a big deep
[53:26] revelation i just want to take my time
[53:28] it's a very simple thought i'm just
[53:29] going to
[53:30] slowly take my time through it so that
[53:32] so that we we
[53:33] get the essence of it because i'm
[53:37] when you think about the thought and
[53:39] school patients that i'm going to talk
[53:40] about it's actually the
[53:43] it's actually the um i would call it
[53:45] almost the backbone of our christian
[53:47] walk
[53:48] of our of our journey here is this term
[53:51] called patience
[53:52] and it's something that that
[53:56] when when the apostle paul talks about
[53:59] older men or women that have been
[54:00] through life's journey and that may be
[54:03] elders or pillars in the church
[54:06] one of the essential ingredients one of
[54:08] the central characteristics that
[54:10] he or she must have is patience
[54:14] he always the bible always lists this
[54:17] this
[54:18] characteristic called patience that they
[54:20] must have patience
[54:21] if they are going to be in that sort of
[54:23] role because it's a it's
[54:25] the sort of thing that is always worked
[54:26] on over our christian walk is our
[54:28] patience
[54:29] it's it's something that that is always
[54:32] refined in the door
[54:33] that is always growing and that when we
[54:36] get the further towards the end of this
[54:38] natural walk we get if things are
[54:41] working as they should be
[54:42] then we should have more patients
[54:45] and we should be we
[54:48] should get to a point where we've got
[54:50] perfect patients
[54:53] because that's what christ is he's
[54:55] perfection and
[54:57] when he works in our lives he brings us
[54:59] to perfection
[55:00] and so there is a place we get to where
[55:02] we have perfect patience when we're
[55:04] younger in our walk we get flustered
[55:05] that's not patience
[55:07] that's that's flusterations you know
[55:10] that's that's worry that's
[55:11] i'm concerned i'm fearful of how things
[55:13] might be but as we go on we have
[55:15] patience
[55:17] but i think and looking into this word
[55:22] because that's how i kind of get these i
[55:23] get one word and i have to sort of look
[55:25] into it
[55:26] it's almost as though the way that
[55:28] english works
[55:29] is that words take on different meanings
[55:32] or the meaning of a word can change over
[55:34] time
[55:35] so that it can mean something else 100
[55:37] 200 300 years later
[55:41] something different than what it was
[55:43] originally saying the king james or in
[55:45] these older versions
[55:47] it was written down a certain the word
[55:48] meant a certain thing but it's almost
[55:49] like now it's changed a bit now
[55:51] what do you think of when you think
[55:52] patience i'm going to probably ask you a
[55:54] question i think you think waiting
[55:55] right like to a big degree you think if
[55:58] i'm patient like
[55:59] i say be patient you know if if you're
[56:03] my generation you'll think is that what
[56:04] you think
[56:05] if i say be patient you say oh okay i'll
[56:07] patiently wait you know
[56:09] it kind of isn't really that we get this
[56:11] wrong term of
[56:13] this thing called patience because it
[56:14] doesn't really exactly mean weight
[56:16] it's actually a very powerful term
[56:19] and it means it actually means to push
[56:21] forward relentlessly
[56:22] as patients it doesn't mean weight it's
[56:25] not weight like
[56:26] sit around and wait it actually means
[56:29] it's very powerful
[56:30] which i didn't really think about it or
[56:32] know about it till i just was looking
[56:33] into this
[56:35] so um let's just stand and we'll just
[56:37] read these few scriptures and then you
[56:38] can have your seats again
[56:39] um romans 12
[56:42] 12.
[56:46] it says rejoicing in hope patient and
[56:49] tribulation
[56:50] continuing instant in prayer patient and
[56:53] tribulation
[56:55] and hebrews 12 1 says
[56:59] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[57:01] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[57:04] let us lay aside every weight and the
[57:06] sin which doth so easily beset us
[57:09] and let us run with patience the race
[57:12] that is set before us
[57:14] may the lord bless his word you can have
[57:15] your seats again this morning for
[57:18] i've got other scriptures but that's the
[57:19] ones we're going to read at the start
[57:22] now when you read this verse here
[57:24] especially hebrews 12
[57:25] 1 it says you run with patience
[57:28] does that mean you run and then as
[57:29] you're running you slow down and you
[57:30] stop and you wait
[57:32] you run with patience and it's a very
[57:35] powerful term and it
[57:36] and yeah that it really means to
[57:40] push forward relentlessly towards a
[57:42] something you're trying to achieve
[57:44] okay but we'll just we'll go i just want
[57:45] to lay that out there
[57:47] but because of our um modern language
[57:51] which it sort of lost its meaning and
[57:52] when we read it we can sort of lose
[57:54] the essence and the power of what this
[57:55] thing actually is and actually how that
[57:58] every one of us need patience
[58:01] and it's a critical component but i've
[58:04] coined this little phrase here
[58:05] and if you want to quote me you can
[58:06] quote this
[58:09] people say persistence but it's not
[58:10] persistence it's patience patience
[58:12] proves
[58:12] patience persists in patients pace
[58:16] and i'm going to refer back to this once
[58:18] i go through this
[58:21] a little thought about patience we'll
[58:22] come back to this and i'll break that
[58:24] down a bit to show you
[58:25] why i meant about about that one there
[58:29] okay but this is the modern i guess the
[58:31] modern understanding of this term called
[58:33] patience
[58:34] i'm just going to go real slow with this
[58:35] that's all right i'm just going to take
[58:36] it slow i'm not in a rush
[58:38] i haven't i've got a few slides to get
[58:39] through but i don't need to power
[58:41] through them like i have through some of
[58:42] the other ones where i can't even take a
[58:43] breath you know
[58:45] okay this is the current term of what
[58:47] patience is
[58:48] if you search the dictionary it says the
[58:50] ability to wait or to continue doing
[58:52] something despite difficulties
[58:53] or to suffer without complaining or
[58:55] becoming annoyed
[58:57] which to a degree is kind of correct but
[59:00] it's not really it sort of
[59:01] lost the essence of what the word
[59:03] actually is in my opinion
[59:04] and i could be wrong i'm not really a
[59:07] i can't say that i've passed english in
[59:09] school but i can say that i read the
[59:10] bible when it says you run with patience
[59:12] and i think okay that doesn't really
[59:13] mean sitting around waiting it means i'm
[59:15] doing something
[59:16] these are the examples in monday terms
[59:19] of of
[59:20] how the word patients would be applied
[59:22] okay uh
[59:24] term one you have to have such a lot of
[59:26] patience when dealing with
[59:27] children with kids number two in the end
[59:30] i lost my patience
[59:32] and shouted at her number three he's a
[59:35] good teacher but he doesn't have much
[59:36] patience with the slower
[59:38] pupils number four making small scale
[59:42] models takes or requires a great deal of
[59:44] patience
[59:46] like excuse me five the youngest son was
[59:49] beginning to try my patients that's a
[59:51] common term you trying my patients
[59:53] and number six patients they'll be here
[59:55] soon
[59:56] to me they're not it's not quite it's
[59:58] sort of not quite how it should be right
[1:00:01] i've changed these words to maybe write
[1:00:03] a better word of what they're talking
[1:00:04] about right
[1:00:05] so this one here number one says
[1:00:09] you could almost this would be a better
[1:00:10] word for the situation rather than
[1:00:12] patience
[1:00:12] you have to have such a lot of
[1:00:14] self-control when you're dealing with
[1:00:16] kids right because what it is is you
[1:00:20] you lose your
[1:00:23] vital control of your emotions and then
[1:00:26] you redline and who knows what would
[1:00:29] happen after that right but that's your
[1:00:31] so your temperance almost your
[1:00:32] temperance has come to its end
[1:00:34] because you're frustrated by a situation
[1:00:37] it's that's more
[1:00:39] what that situation is regarding not so
[1:00:41] much patience like because
[1:00:44] it's not you'll see what i mean as we go
[1:00:45] through but i'll replace these
[1:00:47] in the end this is another one that
[1:00:48] could be referred to as self-control in
[1:00:50] the end i lost my self-control and
[1:00:51] shouted at you
[1:00:54] now we that would that would be a closer
[1:00:57] term i believe than this word patience
[1:00:59] of what the essence of the word patience
[1:01:00] means
[1:01:02] um he
[1:01:05] is a good teacher but he doesn't have
[1:01:07] much i'm going to put the word tolerance
[1:01:08] but there probably are other better
[1:01:10] words but
[1:01:10] tolerance with the slow pupils like he's
[1:01:12] getting frustrated because
[1:01:14] some people are learning fast but others
[1:01:15] are taking a while to pick up what he's
[1:01:17] trying to teach them and it's
[1:01:18] frustrating him you know come on i need
[1:01:20] you to be up with this other
[1:01:22] with the other crowd because now i'm
[1:01:23] having to go back and teach you so he's
[1:01:25] he's
[1:01:27] these examples more based on just a
[1:01:28] personal emotional
[1:01:30] level right of what the examples are
[1:01:33] giving this one here is kind of closer
[1:01:34] to
[1:01:35] the word patience what i believe would
[1:01:36] be so i left this one in here because
[1:01:38] it's
[1:01:40] it's closer because it says making small
[1:01:41] scale models takes or requires a great
[1:01:43] deal of patience because he's trying to
[1:01:44] achieve something
[1:01:46] so he's not sitting around he's trying
[1:01:47] to achieve something but and he's got to
[1:01:49] work
[1:01:50] very hard to achieve it but it but it
[1:01:53] has to be a calculated
[1:01:54] um sound focused
[1:01:58] approach in order to achieve what he
[1:01:59] needs to achieve which is making his
[1:02:00] models so so he has to have this
[1:02:03] patience because he's got to diligently
[1:02:06] press on until he achieves the
[1:02:08] outcome that he's desiring see that
[1:02:10] that's that's more in line with what the
[1:02:12] word patience means like
[1:02:14] i'm going to press forward and achieve
[1:02:16] this thing
[1:02:18] not so much i'm frustrated so i lose it
[1:02:20] you don't really lose your patience
[1:02:22] you give up right
[1:02:26] the youngest son was beginning to try my
[1:02:28] self-control once again these are more
[1:02:29] examples of
[1:02:30] you know self-control
[1:02:33] this word patience they'll be here soon
[1:02:34] we might as well just replace that word
[1:02:36] for wait
[1:02:38] wait you know wait they'll be here soon
[1:02:41] just wait like you're waiting for them
[1:02:43] to arrive so just wait
[1:02:44] you don't really need patience you need
[1:02:46] to wait it's a that is a different word
[1:02:48] but we've now thinking it means patience
[1:02:51] right
[1:02:53] this is what i believe a scriptural term
[1:02:56] or the essence of the word is
[1:02:57] as means more than this term if i'm just
[1:03:00] waiting around because i'm waiting for
[1:03:01] you so i've got to be patient
[1:03:02] it's the ability to persevere towards a
[1:03:05] desired
[1:03:07] or relatively better
[1:03:11] outcome regardless of the obstacles
[1:03:14] circumstances or cost
[1:03:16] so i want to i want something that i
[1:03:19] deem to be better
[1:03:20] so that i am going to continue to press
[1:03:22] on towards that goal
[1:03:24] regardless of how it might seem or what
[1:03:26] the costs or how hard it might be during
[1:03:28] this process i will
[1:03:30] continue to press on until i've reached
[1:03:32] this desired outcome because i deem that
[1:03:34] to be better than the situation that
[1:03:35] i've got now
[1:03:36] that's patience right that's why it says
[1:03:39] run with patience
[1:03:40] the guy running believes that me winning
[1:03:42] the race and getting to the end is a
[1:03:44] great outcome for me
[1:03:45] therefore i am going to focus regardless
[1:03:48] of the
[1:03:48] climbing uphill downhill over fences
[1:03:51] wherever i'm going
[1:03:55] i am i am going to continue to press on
[1:03:58] regardless of what might be happening
[1:04:00] i'm going to have patience that doesn't
[1:04:01] mean i'm going to stop and wait by the
[1:04:02] sideline
[1:04:04] i'm going to run with patience i'm going
[1:04:06] to run with this desire to
[1:04:08] get somewhere because i deem it right
[1:04:09] now it's based on how
[1:04:12] that's why i say the other one was i
[1:04:14] need to slowly explain this relative
[1:04:16] it's relative to what you deem to be
[1:04:18] better
[1:04:19] because not everything we all deem to be
[1:04:20] better is actually better but if we deem
[1:04:22] it to be better then we're going to go
[1:04:23] for it because
[1:04:24] you know if i if i want to be a drunk
[1:04:26] then
[1:04:27] and i i could pursue being a drunk
[1:04:29] because i deem that to be a great
[1:04:31] achievement in my life but that doesn't
[1:04:32] mean it's a great achievement it just
[1:04:33] means i
[1:04:34] relative to my circumstance i think it's
[1:04:36] a great achievement now
[1:04:39] now here why patience why this term
[1:04:42] called patience is because
[1:04:44] because you or we desire something
[1:04:46] better than what we currently have
[1:04:48] we desire that there is i'm gonna i'm
[1:04:51] here but i'm gonna be here and i'm gonna
[1:04:52] patiently
[1:04:54] work towards that that goal whatever it
[1:04:57] is that i think is better that's that's
[1:04:58] what
[1:04:58] this whole term of patience is but it it
[1:05:02] it takes up a big portion of life when
[1:05:04] you when you when you start to break it
[1:05:05] down
[1:05:06] right and you'll see what i mean
[1:05:10] okay so this scripture here is is james
[1:05:12] 5 7
[1:05:13] and it says be patient therefore
[1:05:15] brethren unto the coming of the lord
[1:05:17] behold the husbandman waiteth for the
[1:05:19] precious fruit of the earth and hath
[1:05:21] long
[1:05:21] patience for it until he hath received
[1:05:24] the
[1:05:24] early and later reign but ye
[1:05:28] als be ye also patient establish your
[1:05:30] hearts for the coming of the lord
[1:05:32] draweth nigh now you might think that
[1:05:34] sounds like waiting but i want to show
[1:05:35] you that it doesn't
[1:05:36] mean he's just waiting around because
[1:05:39] he's had to make action
[1:05:40] to do his field right i want to show you
[1:05:42] this
[1:05:44] okay so what i said patience doesn't
[1:05:46] mean waiting we want to get that thought
[1:05:47] away from our mind that it just means i
[1:05:49] wait around
[1:05:51] okay patience is only patience when it
[1:05:54] is related to a specific
[1:05:55] certain outcome like like if someone is
[1:05:59] just waiting
[1:06:01] you say what are you waiting for nothing
[1:06:03] i'm just sitting here
[1:06:05] so then he's not sitting there patiently
[1:06:06] waiting because there's no outcome he's
[1:06:08] trying for he's just sitting there
[1:06:09] so it's like you're just sitting there
[1:06:11] but your patience has got to be based on
[1:06:13] a certain outcome that i'm after
[1:06:15] therefore my patience is going to pursue
[1:06:17] that
[1:06:18] right that's how this thing works and
[1:06:21] in the farmer's case the farmer
[1:06:25] is patiently waiting for something that
[1:06:27] he knows if he pursues on with it he
[1:06:29] will get it
[1:06:30] and this is where the greater term of
[1:06:31] patience comes in because he knows that
[1:06:33] a month two three months ago i planted
[1:06:36] seeds in that earth i dug the ground i
[1:06:37] planted seeds
[1:06:38] there is going to be something happening
[1:06:40] in this field and it is going to be
[1:06:42] better than
[1:06:43] what i had four months ago which was
[1:06:45] bare dirt in six months seven months i
[1:06:47] will be reaping some
[1:06:49] sunflower seeds and my his patience is
[1:06:52] not based on
[1:06:54] i i don't know if anything's gonna grow
[1:06:55] i've never been here before let's just
[1:06:57] wait and see
[1:06:58] it's based on the fact that i planted
[1:06:59] those seeds in the ground
[1:07:01] and each day i'm going to come out make
[1:07:02] sure they're watered i'm going to make
[1:07:04] sure that the weeds are out of the
[1:07:05] ground i'm going to look after it if
[1:07:06] if there's too much rain i'm going to
[1:07:08] drain the soil because i'm patiently
[1:07:10] laboring in my field
[1:07:11] because i believe that the outcome i'm
[1:07:13] going to get is better than the outcome
[1:07:14] that i've got now
[1:07:15] that that's patience so the the the
[1:07:18] right term for him would be the farmer
[1:07:20] patiently
[1:07:21] worked his field until he had ripped the
[1:07:23] harvest
[1:07:24] he didn't just go there and sit down he
[1:07:26] actually there was effort made
[1:07:29] and his patience was was the driving
[1:07:32] force
[1:07:34] to achieve the outcome that he desired
[1:07:36] to have was it was patience
[1:07:38] right because i'll
[1:07:42] show you this other example here of this
[1:07:43] now here's a guy here
[1:07:45] the farmer patiently sat and waited and
[1:07:48] looked at his field year after year
[1:07:50] hoping something would grow
[1:07:53] see that the word patience we're talking
[1:07:55] about wouldn't be applicable in this
[1:07:57] situation here because
[1:07:58] he has done nothing he doesn't know if
[1:08:00] anything's going to happen he's just
[1:08:03] hoping something's going to happen but
[1:08:04] he doesn't actually know see patience is
[1:08:06] not based on i
[1:08:08] on hope patience is based on a solid
[1:08:10] foundation of something
[1:08:11] is going to happen something's going to
[1:08:14] happen i know that it's going to happen
[1:08:15] that's why i see patients proves that
[1:08:17] you believe something's going to happen
[1:08:18] you can't have patience unless you know
[1:08:20] there's going to be an outcome like the
[1:08:21] farmer could patiently work his field
[1:08:23] because he knew there was going to be an
[1:08:25] outcome he wasn't hoping
[1:08:27] this guy here a better term for this one
[1:08:29] would be this right
[1:08:31] the farmer foolishly sat and waited and
[1:08:33] looked at his field year after year
[1:08:34] hoping something would happen
[1:08:36] because he didn't know that anything
[1:08:37] would happen so he just
[1:08:39] waited and chances are nothing will
[1:08:41] happen you'll keep getting what he's
[1:08:42] getting because
[1:08:43] so he wasn't patiently waiting he was
[1:08:45] foolishly waiting and there's a big
[1:08:46] difference in how we
[1:08:47] and this term called patience
[1:08:50] scripturally and how and the
[1:08:52] characteristic of patience that we
[1:08:53] should have
[1:08:54] as a believer and as i get onto it a bit
[1:08:57] you'll find that it's actually a part of
[1:08:59] our nature but it's a part of god's
[1:09:00] nature this thing called patience and
[1:09:02] it's very powerful
[1:09:03] and god's patience with us brings us
[1:09:05] from one place to another because he
[1:09:07] knows he's going to be a definite
[1:09:08] outcome
[1:09:09] he's sure so his patience works it till
[1:09:12] he gets the better outcome that he
[1:09:13] desires
[1:09:14] right we um i don't know if you can see
[1:09:17] this picture here but
[1:09:19] during the day we like to go around to
[1:09:20] houses and cut through water pipes in
[1:09:22] the bottom of houses and cause all this
[1:09:23] water to spray out
[1:09:25] all through the house right it's what we
[1:09:27] do for fun
[1:09:28] we're not supposed to do this but now
[1:09:29] and then we do we cut these pipes and
[1:09:32] the the water we're in certain jobs i
[1:09:34] don't know if any of the guys have
[1:09:36] worked for us and probably never done it
[1:09:38] but you
[1:09:39] you cut a main water pipe in a house
[1:09:42] that's under mains pressure
[1:09:44] you only need to knick this pipe like so
[1:09:47] small
[1:09:48] sort of like our carnival nature you
[1:09:50] know you just need to knick it a bit and
[1:09:52] out it comes you know it's high pressure
[1:09:55] under there you know you want to keep
[1:09:56] that thing subdued don't cut it don't
[1:09:57] let it out
[1:09:59] that's what this is like you know you do
[1:10:00] a tiny nick and man it's like
[1:10:03] you because it happens so suddenly you
[1:10:05] don't know what hit you man you're like
[1:10:06] whoa and all of a sudden the wood is
[1:10:07] spraying out and it the water doesn't
[1:10:09] care what's there like our carnal nature
[1:10:11] when it explodes it doesn't care what's
[1:10:12] there it just makes a big mess
[1:10:14] everywhere whether there's a dice tv in
[1:10:16] the corner there or whether there's a
[1:10:18] fridge or whether there's nice carpet
[1:10:19] this pipe and the
[1:10:21] the water in the pipe doesn't care it
[1:10:22] just goes man so
[1:10:25] so you wouldn't say in this situation
[1:10:26] the worker patiently sat and watched as
[1:10:28] the water flooded the house
[1:10:30] you know oh he's a very patient man he
[1:10:31] just sat and watched you'd get into
[1:10:33] action and
[1:10:34] you know turn the water mains off stop
[1:10:37] this water from blasting through the
[1:10:38] house because the outcome that it's
[1:10:39] happening you don't want
[1:10:41] so that's why you wouldn't say i
[1:10:43] patiently waited because i don't want
[1:10:44] all the water to spray through the house
[1:10:46] therefore i'm not patiently waiting i'm
[1:10:47] stopping this thing because i don't want
[1:10:48] that
[1:10:49] i patiently want to finish this job
[1:10:51] without making a big mess so
[1:10:54] see that's why i say this one here would
[1:10:56] be the worker foolishly sat and watched
[1:10:57] as the water flooded the house
[1:10:59] right that would be the right term if
[1:11:00] you're just sitting down doing nothing
[1:11:02] about
[1:11:02] getting this outcome okay so i'm going
[1:11:05] to read this to you again patience the
[1:11:07] ability to persevere towards a desired
[1:11:10] or better outcome regardless of the
[1:11:11] obstacle circumstances or cost
[1:11:15] and i'm going to say this again just to
[1:11:16] really drill it in why patients because
[1:11:17] we desire something better than what we
[1:11:19] currently have that's what this patience
[1:11:21] is the whole thing of it is for
[1:11:23] is to get us from one point to another
[1:11:25] to a better point that's the whole
[1:11:26] purpose of patience
[1:11:28] however in this situation here if for
[1:11:30] some reason
[1:11:31] we were trying to flood a house with
[1:11:33] water and that was our goal and we were
[1:11:35] searching around for a pipe we maybe
[1:11:37] worked for hours to try and find a pipe
[1:11:38] and suddenly we found him and we cut
[1:11:40] it would be so happy i found a pipe guys
[1:11:43] you can all rest up now we found it and
[1:11:45] we could then patiently sit and let the
[1:11:46] house fill up with water we've done it
[1:11:48] we high five we we enjoy we celebrate
[1:11:50] we've patiently achieved our goal you
[1:11:52] know we
[1:11:53] how it took us days maybe to to get here
[1:11:55] but we're here now we can now patiently
[1:11:57] sit back
[1:11:58] see patient this patients we're talking
[1:12:00] about is based on an out on a
[1:12:01] desired outcome not and it's not based
[1:12:04] on a negative outcome it's on the
[1:12:05] desired
[1:12:06] our desired outcome that we deem to be
[1:12:08] better than the circumstances that we've
[1:12:09] got now
[1:12:11] okay that's why i say here patience is
[1:12:13] only patience when it's related to a
[1:12:15] specific certain outcome
[1:12:17] that's why i say you can't sit on a
[1:12:19] chair and your goal is to sit on a chair
[1:12:22] well
[1:12:22] you don't have a goal you're just
[1:12:23] sitting on a chair doing nothing you
[1:12:24] can't say he's just patiently sitting
[1:12:26] because he's got
[1:12:27] it's not based on anything if he's
[1:12:29] patiently sitting with a fishing rod in
[1:12:30] his hand or her hand
[1:12:32] then he's patiently fishing because he's
[1:12:34] going to stay there fishing
[1:12:35] and he wants to get five fish and he'll
[1:12:37] stay there for months until he gets five
[1:12:39] fish
[1:12:40] see now he's patiently he's still doing
[1:12:42] the same thing except now he's got an
[1:12:44] objective so he's going to patiently
[1:12:45] work his objective
[1:12:46] regardless of whether it rains whether
[1:12:48] it's sun whether he gets hungry whether
[1:12:49] or not he's going to stay there and sit
[1:12:50] and keep fishing
[1:12:52] till he catches his five fish and once
[1:12:54] he's got his fly fish
[1:12:55] i'm done and that's what his patience is
[1:12:57] going to drive him to do
[1:12:59] it's and that's why i say this word here
[1:13:01] she patiently pursued her agenda
[1:13:04] right and here's the guy sitting on
[1:13:08] chairs
[1:13:09] unless there's a purpose it's not
[1:13:10] patience it has to have has to be
[1:13:12] related to a purpose
[1:13:14] and what you deem to be a better thing
[1:13:15] otherwise you don't we wouldn't that's
[1:13:17] why i say in the beginning like
[1:13:19] i lost my patience with my child well
[1:13:21] it's not really that's
[1:13:22] it's not really related to this term of
[1:13:24] patience you see now that's more just
[1:13:26] how you lost your
[1:13:27] you weren't temperate okay
[1:13:30] and that's why we come back to the
[1:13:31] scripture now and it says wherefore also
[1:13:34] seeing we can pass about was so great at
[1:13:35] cloud of witnesses let us laugh at every
[1:13:37] weight and the so much stuff easily
[1:13:38] beside us and let us run with patience
[1:13:41] the race that is set before us let us
[1:13:43] we're pursuing forward for this goal so
[1:13:45] we're going to run with patience
[1:13:47] we're not going to run and stop we're
[1:13:48] going to run with patience okay
[1:13:54] once again the the ability to persevere
[1:13:56] towards the desired
[1:13:58] or relatively better outcome regardless
[1:14:00] of the obstacle circumstances or cost
[1:14:02] now when you look into this you realize
[1:14:05] that patience
[1:14:06] is the critical component needed for
[1:14:07] success in anything is patience
[1:14:09] it's a critical component in any aspect
[1:14:12] of any achievements we're going to make
[1:14:13] is patience
[1:14:15] this ability to press on regardless of
[1:14:18] whatever the cost is
[1:14:19] and to achieve it that's if you don't
[1:14:21] have this component
[1:14:22] then chances are you won't succeed in
[1:14:24] much in life because you need this
[1:14:25] component
[1:14:27] right but when you look into it you
[1:14:28] realize there are two types of patients
[1:14:31] that are in existence there may be three
[1:14:34] but i didn't look into whether satan has
[1:14:35] patience or not and i kind of ran out of
[1:14:36] time i think he may have but
[1:14:38] he uses ours anyway but let's just go
[1:14:40] with this for now we'll leave the other
[1:14:42] one for another time
[1:14:44] but there is natural patience which is
[1:14:45] what we have a degree of is patience
[1:14:48] right and it's driven by
[1:14:52] your desire and my desire our patience
[1:14:54] is driven by our desires
[1:14:56] and also our natural patience is driven
[1:14:58] by satan's desires as well because he
[1:15:00] could put a desire in us and our natural
[1:15:01] patients will
[1:15:02] push forward towards his goal but
[1:15:05] there's also a godly patience
[1:15:07] so god has this thing called patience
[1:15:09] that exists it's not like
[1:15:11] a wishy-washy thing it's something that
[1:15:12] does exist a desire that he's
[1:15:14] pursuing forward for its godly patience
[1:15:17] and the thing with patience is it's not
[1:15:20] something that exists on its own
[1:15:23] it has to be driven by the desire of a
[1:15:25] person
[1:15:27] patients can't just do things it doesn't
[1:15:29] work like that it's
[1:15:30] linked to a person it's linked
[1:15:33] specifically to a person and
[1:15:34] specifically to a person's desires right
[1:15:38] like a
[1:15:39] drum kit can't have patience because no
[1:15:41] one is there to
[1:15:43] it's not achieving anything for anybody
[1:15:44] this patience is there to achieve things
[1:15:46] for us it's a it's like a servant so it
[1:15:48] has to be linked to a person
[1:15:51] that's why i say we have a degree of
[1:15:52] patience but god also has this thing
[1:15:54] called patience that's linked to his
[1:15:55] personality
[1:15:57] linked to his plan his desire
[1:16:00] right that's that's what this patient
[1:16:02] says it's it's not just on its own
[1:16:04] somewhere
[1:16:05] okay i'm going to show you this little
[1:16:08] example
[1:16:09] and then i'll show you some natural
[1:16:10] examples of patients but in this
[1:16:12] situation here i think this is relevant
[1:16:14] i think this works
[1:16:15] it worked once and it didn't work when i
[1:16:16] read it again then it worked when i read
[1:16:17] it after that so i think it's relevant
[1:16:21] it may more show someone's desire but
[1:16:23] still it in this situation here you had
[1:16:25] um jesus telling his disciples from that
[1:16:30] time forth
[1:16:31] um sorry i can't say that it's too small
[1:16:33] from that time forth began jesus to show
[1:16:35] unto his disciples how that he must go
[1:16:36] unto jerusalem and to suffer many things
[1:16:38] of the elders and chief priests and
[1:16:40] scribes
[1:16:40] and to be killed and to be raised again
[1:16:42] in the third day so he's telling his
[1:16:44] disciples these are the negative things
[1:16:45] that are going to happen to me
[1:16:47] in the future sometime and then peter
[1:16:50] took him and began to rebuke him saying
[1:16:52] be it far from the lord this shall not
[1:16:53] be unto thee
[1:16:55] right so his patience
[1:16:58] his desire was for jesus to stay alive
[1:17:01] and be healthy
[1:17:02] do well you know that was his desire so
[1:17:04] now his patience hooked into his desire
[1:17:06] and he began to push forward and say
[1:17:08] lord this won't happen to you
[1:17:10] i'm going to be with you to protect you
[1:17:11] if this guy's going to come and try and
[1:17:13] get you
[1:17:13] i'm going to fight against them if the
[1:17:16] jews try and get you i'll let you know
[1:17:18] i'll
[1:17:18] i'll talk to my friends that are in the
[1:17:20] circles of the synagogues and that
[1:17:22] well i'll give you information if
[1:17:23] they're going to come and get you i'm
[1:17:24] going to look after you
[1:17:25] because this negative thing that you've
[1:17:27] told me about is not going to happen to
[1:17:29] you
[1:17:29] not as long as i'm around right and he
[1:17:31] he started having this desire
[1:17:35] to stop this thing from happening to him
[1:17:36] and a good desire right
[1:17:38] he was trying to look after his friend
[1:17:40] and his
[1:17:41] so there was him with with his desire to
[1:17:43] look after his friend then his patience
[1:17:45] is pushing that desire i'm going to stop
[1:17:47] this right
[1:17:48] now jesus also had patience right
[1:17:52] so he said but he turned unto peter and
[1:17:54] said get thee behind me satan
[1:17:56] for thou art an offence unto me for
[1:17:59] their saviours not the things that be of
[1:18:01] god but the things that be of men
[1:18:03] jesus had another desire which was to go
[1:18:05] and pay the price of
[1:18:07] for all of us and his patience was
[1:18:09] driving that desire
[1:18:11] and when he came face to face with
[1:18:13] another
[1:18:14] man that had when they i guess the two
[1:18:18] the two forces met and jesus said get
[1:18:20] behind me
[1:18:21] i'm going to press on with what i'm
[1:18:22] going to achieve see his patience was
[1:18:24] driving him
[1:18:26] right it was because the certain outcome
[1:18:28] was i'm going to pay this price
[1:18:31] i'm going to pay the price of death and
[1:18:33] i'm going to my outcome is going to be
[1:18:35] i'm going to save all you people you're
[1:18:36] going to be with me that's my goal
[1:18:37] and my patience is going to drive
[1:18:39] towards and if you try and stop me along
[1:18:40] along the way
[1:18:41] i'm going to push it back because i'm
[1:18:42] going to carry on see he was patiently
[1:18:44] pursuing his agenda
[1:18:46] right okay
[1:18:50] now i don't know if satan has patience i
[1:18:52] assume he may have patience i'm not sure
[1:18:54] we'll leave that but i know god has
[1:18:56] patience right
[1:18:59] okay but it doesn't matter whether
[1:19:00] because satan just uses our patients
[1:19:02] anyway to manifest his will on the earth
[1:19:04] he that's how he has to work so i'm just
[1:19:06] going with
[1:19:06] that he uses our one he can't work any
[1:19:09] other way anyway he needs us to work
[1:19:11] through
[1:19:11] that's how satan exists in this realm he
[1:19:14] you know in movies and things they
[1:19:17] portray as though these spiritual things
[1:19:19] come in and cause all the stuff and do
[1:19:20] things
[1:19:20] satan doesn't have the power to do that
[1:19:22] he can only work through us
[1:19:24] it's all made up stuff you know he
[1:19:25] doesn't have that ability
[1:19:27] not like what people think that he does
[1:19:30] okay but galatians 5 22 says but the
[1:19:32] fruit of the spirit is love
[1:19:33] joy peace patience now the reason why i
[1:19:38] wrote this one is is because if when we
[1:19:40] say a fruit of the spirit what we mean
[1:19:41] is a characteristic
[1:19:43] of this personality because because the
[1:19:45] spirit of god is
[1:19:46] a its person it's christ it's god and we
[1:19:49] get his
[1:19:50] personality in us and along with that
[1:19:53] personality come personality traits
[1:19:56] like we all have personality traits that
[1:19:57] are part of our character you know
[1:20:00] when we become a christian we try and
[1:20:02] god sort of subdues the old the bad ones
[1:20:04] and we keep the
[1:20:05] enhances the good characteristics you
[1:20:06] know so we he changes us but we all have
[1:20:09] characteristics
[1:20:10] now god has characteristics in his
[1:20:12] personality
[1:20:14] right one of those is love he's got this
[1:20:16] characteristic of love that exists it's
[1:20:17] not
[1:20:18] something that we make up it actually
[1:20:19] exists it's a force
[1:20:21] it's a so there is a godly love that
[1:20:23] when we get the spirit of god we get a
[1:20:24] portion of this godly love that
[1:20:26] that it drives itself it doesn't need us
[1:20:28] to try and work it up it drives itself
[1:20:30] that's why the more we surrender the
[1:20:31] more
[1:20:32] and let his life come through the more
[1:20:34] his his traits his personality can come
[1:20:36] through in our life so
[1:20:37] it's not that's why i say this morning
[1:20:39] like it's not us doing it it's
[1:20:40] surrendering and letting him his
[1:20:42] personality
[1:20:44] joy you know we don't have to work up
[1:20:46] joy i'm trying to be happy
[1:20:48] we just surrender to him and his joy
[1:20:50] exists without us being happy
[1:20:52] with us being happy or not right so
[1:20:54] patience
[1:20:55] is also a characteristic of god
[1:20:59] that's patience it's this ability to
[1:21:02] press forward
[1:21:03] to achieve a certain outcome now the
[1:21:04] patience of god always presses forward
[1:21:06] towards achieving the outcome of his
[1:21:08] word
[1:21:08] because that's his his word is what he
[1:21:10] said so that's his desire so that's what
[1:21:12] his patience is going to
[1:21:13] push forward for right and it's also in
[1:21:16] the statue of a perfect man and besides
[1:21:17] this given all diligence add to your
[1:21:18] faith virtue and to virtue knowledge
[1:21:20] and to knowledge temperance and to
[1:21:21] temperance patience
[1:21:24] add to that so and it's that's one of
[1:21:25] the latter stages of our
[1:21:27] of the building of a christian right as
[1:21:28] patients
[1:21:30] because it's more than just like i sit
[1:21:32] and wait it's like i know everything's
[1:21:34] going to be all right
[1:21:35] i don't have to get flustered by it i
[1:21:37] don't have to get worried by it
[1:21:38] i've been through enough things that i
[1:21:40] know that i can patiently just press on
[1:21:41] regardless of what i see regardless of
[1:21:43] if it looks like it's going to go well
[1:21:45] bad whatever it is i can patiently press
[1:21:47] on in this walk i can run this race
[1:21:49] patiently
[1:21:50] i don't need to worry everything's going
[1:21:51] to be right there's seed in the ground
[1:21:52] it's going to grow i just keep
[1:21:54] doing this i keep doing that it's all
[1:21:55] going to work out all right i don't need
[1:21:57] to worry about it
[1:21:58] i can patiently press on regardless of
[1:22:00] what happens
[1:22:02] and that's why it's at the latter stage
[1:22:03] because that we learn that over time you
[1:22:05] know
[1:22:05] it's all going to be all right the
[1:22:06] lord's in control i can just patiently
[1:22:08] press on
[1:22:09] that's what gets added to our
[1:22:10] characteristic
[1:22:13] okay but let me go on this one for a
[1:22:16] little bit right
[1:22:18] let me go to natural patients now for a
[1:22:19] second natural patience is driven by
[1:22:22] the desire of a man woman or satan
[1:22:23] coming in us and driving us right
[1:22:25] now natural patients will always render
[1:22:28] success
[1:22:30] because that's a critical component for
[1:22:31] success but that doesn't mean that
[1:22:33] it's right okay let me give you some
[1:22:35] examples of this
[1:22:36] i don't know if you can read the writing
[1:22:38] at the bottom but here's guys in the 70s
[1:22:41] some of these guys camp out for days you
[1:22:43] know because i've just got a silly
[1:22:45] example here that
[1:22:46] like a big band pink floyd is going to
[1:22:47] release a new album
[1:22:49] and these guys i want to say i want that
[1:22:52] album and i want to be the first to get
[1:22:53] my hands on it they've got a limited
[1:22:54] supply at
[1:22:55] such and such a shop guys will go and
[1:22:57] see the tent up in the street you know
[1:23:00] because the outc the desired outcome is
[1:23:01] they want that album
[1:23:03] and their patience will will cause them
[1:23:06] to pursue this desired outcome they're
[1:23:07] going to sit there on the street they'll
[1:23:08] wait in the rain
[1:23:10] you know and when they finally get it
[1:23:11] they're like i've got this album i'm so
[1:23:13] happy
[1:23:14] there it was driven by their patience
[1:23:16] which was a desire they deemed it
[1:23:18] that when i get the album i'm going to
[1:23:19] be better than what i am now it's going
[1:23:20] to be a better outcome
[1:23:22] so so but just because they use their
[1:23:24] patients it doesn't mean that
[1:23:25] it didn't direct them in the right way
[1:23:28] right they got a pink fluid album so
[1:23:30] what waste of time
[1:23:31] see our natural our patients can drive
[1:23:33] us in the wrong direction
[1:23:36] and natural patients here's this one
[1:23:38] here he patiently taught him how to
[1:23:40] handle his alcohol till he could drink a
[1:23:42] dozen beers and not feel drunk you know
[1:23:45] this guy couldn't drink anything we need
[1:23:46] to nut but it took me about a year but
[1:23:48] we worked on it we worked on it now we
[1:23:49] can down 12 bottles and
[1:23:52] you know and man it was hard work
[1:23:54] teaching him and i had to be
[1:23:55] i patiently taught him you know he used
[1:23:57] his patience
[1:23:59] because he thought he deemed said this
[1:24:01] was relative
[1:24:02] the teacher deemed that it's going to be
[1:24:04] better and obviously the student did too
[1:24:05] that i can drink 12 beers and not feel
[1:24:07] it
[1:24:08] that's a better outcome for me so they
[1:24:10] were patiently pursuing the wrong
[1:24:11] direction
[1:24:12] just like peter was going to patiently
[1:24:13] pursue the wrong direction
[1:24:15] these guys here are too that's this is
[1:24:18] but you can call this success in their
[1:24:20] eyes
[1:24:21] i'm successful see that's why i say
[1:24:23] every degree of success requires
[1:24:24] patience
[1:24:25] but it's not always successful the
[1:24:26] success that we achieve
[1:24:28] the only success is surrendering our
[1:24:30] life to christ and letting his actual
[1:24:32] patience working his will patiently
[1:24:35] working his will
[1:24:36] to achieve his outcome that's real
[1:24:38] success in our life
[1:24:40] this is a bad one but this is true
[1:24:42] hitler patiently opposed the jews
[1:24:45] until he had slaughtered a great
[1:24:46] majority of them it took him a lot of
[1:24:48] effort to achieve that outcome
[1:24:50] he didn't just sit back and go well
[1:24:51] let's hope it happens he patiently
[1:24:53] pursued his plan
[1:24:54] they had meeting after meeting and all
[1:24:56] sorts of ideas and trying
[1:24:58] things to patiently pursue this agenda
[1:25:01] but the outcome was so negative but yet
[1:25:04] for them it was successful
[1:25:05] i succeeded we succeeded congratulations
[1:25:08] you know but there
[1:25:09] they patiently pursued their agenda they
[1:25:11] ran with patients a race set before them
[1:25:13] the race set before them was let's
[1:25:14] exterminate them
[1:25:16] so they they in their terms relatively
[1:25:20] speaking they were successful
[1:25:21] but we look on that and think that
[1:25:22] wasn't successful that was horrible okay
[1:25:27] i'm just going this way i'm just going
[1:25:28] to go so i'm just going slow through
[1:25:29] this okay
[1:25:31] god's patience right
[1:25:36] this is the reason why i showed you
[1:25:38] those things is because
[1:25:39] our own desire we can easily get
[1:25:42] our own patients that we have can easily
[1:25:45] drive us off on the wrong track we've
[1:25:47] what we actually need is god's patience
[1:25:49] because god's patience will only push
[1:25:51] his will god's patience won't push our
[1:25:54] will
[1:25:55] like it will only push his will because
[1:25:58] he deems
[1:25:58] if if the lord has a certain objective
[1:26:01] then his patience is going to push his
[1:26:03] own objective it's not going to he
[1:26:04] doesn't come down and push our objective
[1:26:06] he pushes his own objective because it's
[1:26:08] patience is linked to a person's
[1:26:10] objective right so what we want to do
[1:26:13] firstly we want to see what what is
[1:26:15] god's objective for us
[1:26:17] and i like this scripture here i've got
[1:26:18] two when i've gone through these i've
[1:26:20] gotten a few different versions because
[1:26:21] sometimes our
[1:26:22] my english is not that great so i find
[1:26:24] reading a few
[1:26:25] other ones sometimes to get the essence
[1:26:26] of it i failed in english
[1:26:29] but for this very reason i was shown
[1:26:31] mercy so that in me
[1:26:33] the worst of sin is christ jesus might
[1:26:36] display his perfect
[1:26:37] patience as an example to those who
[1:26:40] would believe
[1:26:41] in him for eternal life see
[1:26:45] i'll read it from the king james
[1:26:46] underneath how bad for this cause i
[1:26:48] obtain mercy that and me first
[1:26:50] jesus christ might show forth all
[1:26:52] long-suffering but it's the same word
[1:26:53] patience in the greek it's the word
[1:26:55] they just switch it around now and then
[1:26:57] but it's it actually means patience
[1:26:59] for a pattern to them who should
[1:27:00] hereafter believe on him to life
[1:27:02] everlasting
[1:27:03] so now when paul is speaking about
[1:27:06] perfect patience
[1:27:08] what he's saying is god saw me and he
[1:27:11] had a desire that i would be in a better
[1:27:13] place than what i am was at that point
[1:27:15] he had an objective he looked at me with
[1:27:17] an objective i've got an objective to
[1:27:19] get him from there to there
[1:27:21] currently he's all over the place but
[1:27:22] i've got an objective and i'm going to
[1:27:25] start my work and pursue that patiently
[1:27:28] pursue that objective till paul comes
[1:27:30] from a
[1:27:31] unworthy sinner to a saint and filled
[1:27:33] with the spirit of god and
[1:27:34] walking in the joy of the lord that was
[1:27:35] god's objective so and paul is saying
[1:27:38] can't you see the patience of the lord
[1:27:40] how that
[1:27:42] how that he there was it was a driving
[1:27:44] force which was his patience
[1:27:46] his driving force came and got me and
[1:27:48] brought me from this to that
[1:27:49] that was the patience of god that's why
[1:27:51] he says his that christ jesus might
[1:27:53] display his perfect patience
[1:27:55] as an example to show you look if he can
[1:27:57] do this for me if if that patience he
[1:27:59] has that driving force
[1:28:01] to patiently pursue his agenda can win
[1:28:03] me over then it can win you over as well
[1:28:05] that's that's what he's saying or
[1:28:08] despise the sound of the riches of his
[1:28:09] goodness and forbearance and
[1:28:10] long-suffering knowing that the goodness
[1:28:11] of god leadeth it to repentance and
[1:28:13] once again the same word or do you show
[1:28:15] contempt for the riches of his kindness
[1:28:17] forbearance and patience
[1:28:19] not realizing that god's kindness is
[1:28:21] intended to lead you to repentance
[1:28:23] now the reason why you can link it to
[1:28:24] long suffering to away and that word is
[1:28:26] because
[1:28:27] that means regardless of what how you're
[1:28:30] acting
[1:28:30] i'm not going to give up i'm not just
[1:28:33] going to give up on the process of
[1:28:34] bringing you to there today from here to
[1:28:36] here even if you're not acting
[1:28:38] very good and you seemingly are going
[1:28:40] against my purpose
[1:28:42] and my outcome i'm not just going to
[1:28:44] give up i'm not just going to go oh well
[1:28:46] we tried
[1:28:46] no my patience is it doesn't patience
[1:28:49] doesn't have an end point it just
[1:28:50] carries on and
[1:28:51] perfect patience pursues to get the
[1:28:52] outcome
[1:28:54] regardless of what the circumstance
[1:28:55] might be it's going to pursue it
[1:28:57] but perfect patience knows that the
[1:28:58] outcome is achievable and it is going to
[1:29:00] get it
[1:29:01] period that's what perfect patience does
[1:29:03] and god has perfect patience and his
[1:29:04] outcomes are always going to be achieved
[1:29:06] period
[1:29:08] right
[1:29:10] now i'm going to read you some
[1:29:11] scriptures based on those i'm just going
[1:29:13] to read through this because when you
[1:29:14] think of the word now when you start to
[1:29:16] read these scriptures the word takes on
[1:29:17] a different meaning right
[1:29:21] now this is now patience towards each
[1:29:22] other in a godly sense
[1:29:25] with all long suffering and meekness
[1:29:27] with all loneliness and meekness with
[1:29:29] long suffering
[1:29:30] for bearing one another in love or
[1:29:31] there's another one always be humble and
[1:29:33] gentle
[1:29:34] be patient with each other making
[1:29:36] allowance for each other's faults
[1:29:37] because
[1:29:38] of your love now
[1:29:41] now when you look at this in that light
[1:29:43] with the term of being patient with each
[1:29:45] other
[1:29:46] you can understand that god's how would
[1:29:50] i describe it like
[1:29:51] my desire for you my godly desire for
[1:29:54] you is that you would be better than
[1:29:55] what you are now
[1:29:57] and i know that god is able to get you
[1:29:59] let's say i'm upset with you for some
[1:30:01] reason
[1:30:02] but my but if i tap into god's desire it
[1:30:05] is that you would be from here to here
[1:30:07] you would be better therefore my my
[1:30:10] patience towards you should be based on
[1:30:12] is a driving force i can i can ride
[1:30:14] through the storm i can ride through all
[1:30:16] your carnal things and my kind of things
[1:30:17] because
[1:30:18] we know that the outcome we're going to
[1:30:19] achieve is better than what it is now so
[1:30:21] i can patiently endure with whatever i
[1:30:23] need to with
[1:30:24] the brethren in this case you know i can
[1:30:26] be patient with you
[1:30:27] because there's this driving force that
[1:30:29] knows the outcome is going to be better
[1:30:31] than what it currently is therefore i
[1:30:32] don't have to get frustrated or
[1:30:33] why do they keep doing that no no at
[1:30:35] some point they won't do that
[1:30:37] at some point that will stop because
[1:30:38] there's a because god's
[1:30:40] remember if i tap into as a christian we
[1:30:42] don't have our own
[1:30:43] our own patience now and our objective
[1:30:45] is based on the word of god and on
[1:30:47] his objective therefore we come into
[1:30:49] that channel and that's what it's
[1:30:50] talking about here
[1:30:51] with be patient with each other
[1:30:54] not i'll be patient while he learns how
[1:30:56] to drink more it's not based on that
[1:30:58] it's based on god's objective
[1:31:00] this here is based on god's objective
[1:31:01] that we each other are going to
[1:31:03] come into the statue of a perfect man so
[1:31:05] it's saying
[1:31:06] that that's so tap into god's objective
[1:31:09] what his objective is for each one of us
[1:31:11] and patiently pursue that
[1:31:13] let god's patience come through us and
[1:31:15] pursue that objective in each other
[1:31:17] that's what that's what this is related
[1:31:19] to
[1:31:20] specifically to god's purpose okay
[1:31:24] being strengthened with all power
[1:31:26] according to his glorious might so that
[1:31:28] you might have full endurance
[1:31:30] and patience and joyfully i'll read you
[1:31:32] this other one strengthen with all
[1:31:34] might according to his glorious power
[1:31:35] unto all patience and long suffering
[1:31:37] with joyfulness
[1:31:39] you think why would it say you're
[1:31:40] strengthened and you're getting powerful
[1:31:41] and everything's moving on and that
[1:31:42] saves with patience
[1:31:44] because this thing called patience knows
[1:31:46] that regardless of what happens then
[1:31:48] as a as i get stronger i understand that
[1:31:50] regardless of what happens i'm pressing
[1:31:52] on towards the goal of
[1:31:55] of in this case receiving more of christ
[1:31:57] in me
[1:31:58] i'm pressing on with that my patience is
[1:32:00] going to press on with it that's why it
[1:32:01] says
[1:32:02] be strengthened unto all patients
[1:32:05] you understand this quote it's yep
[1:32:09] therefore as the elect of god holy and
[1:32:10] beloved close yourselves with hearts of
[1:32:12] compassion
[1:32:13] kindness humility gentleness and
[1:32:15] patience
[1:32:16] have that as a part of you
[1:32:22] now now that you when we understand that
[1:32:24] this idea of patience then when we read
[1:32:26] the things that paul talks about we can
[1:32:27] understand
[1:32:28] more why he is saying it he says
[1:32:32] truly the signs of an apostle were
[1:32:35] wrought among you
[1:32:36] and all patience and signs and wonders
[1:32:38] and in mighty deeds or
[1:32:40] this one here was explains it the way
[1:32:41] that we would when i was with you i
[1:32:43] certainly gave you
[1:32:44] proof that i am an apostle for i
[1:32:47] patiently did many signs and wonders
[1:32:48] among you
[1:32:50] so he's saying i was with you and i had
[1:32:53] this objective that christ might be
[1:32:54] displayed to you
[1:32:55] because that was the call and god said
[1:32:57] go
[1:32:59] the lord will tell paul go there and
[1:33:00] display me to those people
[1:33:02] right so that was paula tapped into
[1:33:05] god's objective for
[1:33:06] the corinthians when he was there my
[1:33:09] that's my objective
[1:33:10] he wasn't there i want to go there and
[1:33:12] make a million dollars it wasn't as
[1:33:13] objective as if he was there from the
[1:33:15] lord
[1:33:15] he was following the lord's objective
[1:33:17] and he patiently pursued that objective
[1:33:19] which he says
[1:33:21] lord uh he woke up we'll wake up every
[1:33:22] day and think lord um where do you want
[1:33:24] me to go today who should i speak to
[1:33:25] what shall i say
[1:33:26] you know and situations will come should
[1:33:28] i pray for that person as this can
[1:33:29] happen and he
[1:33:30] he patiently wrought the agenda of the
[1:33:32] lord
[1:33:33] not by sitting back doing nothing but
[1:33:34] press forward every day
[1:33:36] and for a patient he did many signs and
[1:33:39] monies and miracles among you
[1:33:40] i was i knew there was going to be a
[1:33:42] better outcome than what there currently
[1:33:43] was
[1:33:43] so i patiently pursued it day after day
[1:33:45] after day after day after day
[1:33:47] until we get a better outcome which is
[1:33:49] now you're all you've seen the signs
[1:33:50] you've seen the wonders you're believers
[1:33:52] you're walking with the lord it's a lot
[1:33:53] better now than what it was when i first
[1:33:54] turned up
[1:33:55] because i patiently pursued the agenda
[1:33:58] of god
[1:34:02] but in all things approving ourselves as
[1:34:05] the ministers of god so now you want to
[1:34:07] be a minister
[1:34:08] and much patience and this ability to
[1:34:11] press
[1:34:12] on regardless of what might happen
[1:34:14] whether it's good whether it's bad
[1:34:15] as a minister someone that wants to
[1:34:17] administer the grace of god you've got
[1:34:18] to have the single patience otherwise
[1:34:20] when it gets tough what are you going to
[1:34:21] do run away fail
[1:34:24] i don't mean fail like but i do mean
[1:34:27] fail because
[1:34:28] patience won't let us fail because it
[1:34:30] will say look even though it looks bleak
[1:34:32] i'm going to carry on you know
[1:34:33] but it's all falling apart no it hasn't
[1:34:35] i'm going to press on
[1:34:36] because satan's going to be trying our
[1:34:38] patience
[1:34:40] do they mean it he's going to be at us
[1:34:43] and much patience and afflictions and
[1:34:44] necessities in distresses
[1:34:46] you want to be a minister you need
[1:34:48] patience you need this ability to press
[1:34:50] on
[1:34:50] the agenda of god regardless of the
[1:34:52] circumstances
[1:34:54] take my brethren the prophets who have
[1:34:55] spoken in the name of the lord for an
[1:34:57] example of suffering affliction and of
[1:34:58] patience behold we count them happy
[1:35:01] which endure ye have heard of the
[1:35:02] patience of job
[1:35:04] and have seen the end of the lord that
[1:35:05] the lord is very pitiful and of tender
[1:35:07] mercy
[1:35:08] he wasn't patiently waiting for his
[1:35:10] boils to get worse
[1:35:12] he knew that there was going to be a
[1:35:13] better outcome than what he had
[1:35:14] currently
[1:35:16] so he patiently he was patiently waiting
[1:35:19] on the salvation of the lord
[1:35:20] he wasn't just sitting there but he was
[1:35:23] he said no it's going to be alright
[1:35:24] folks
[1:35:25] his friends were coming up saying oh
[1:35:26] it's because you've done this you've
[1:35:27] done that no i haven't
[1:35:29] it's just the lord trying me but
[1:35:30] everything's going to be all right he
[1:35:32] could patiently press on
[1:35:33] and his patience got him an outcome if
[1:35:37] he had given up said i'm done with this
[1:35:39] the lord he failed me i'm off then he
[1:35:42] had no patience
[1:35:44] right but if we hope for that we see not
[1:35:48] then do we with patience wait for it
[1:35:51] another one same similar but if we hope
[1:35:53] for what we do not yet have we wait for
[1:35:55] it patiently
[1:35:57] see this is waiting patiently for it
[1:35:58] because i know there's going to be an
[1:35:59] outcome i'm not just
[1:36:00] waiting for nothing i know there's going
[1:36:02] to be an outcome therefore my patience
[1:36:04] this critical component is going to
[1:36:06] continue to wait because i'm going to
[1:36:08] get this
[1:36:08] i'm not just aimlessly doing this this
[1:36:11] is based on
[1:36:12] specific factual information god is
[1:36:15] going to deliver me
[1:36:16] it's fact and i'm just going to
[1:36:17] patiently pursue any care if the
[1:36:19] circumstances
[1:36:20] appear like against this the desire that
[1:36:23] i have
[1:36:24] god is going to deliver i'm going to
[1:36:25] patiently pursue this every single day
[1:36:27] that might mean i sit might mean iran
[1:36:28] might mean i walk i mean i do whatever i
[1:36:30] do
[1:36:31] but i've got the single patience that's
[1:36:32] pursuing it daily
[1:36:34] that's what patience is to them who by
[1:36:37] patient continuance and well-doing
[1:36:39] seek for glory and honor and immortality
[1:36:41] eternal life
[1:36:43] patient continuance he just i'm going on
[1:36:45] and just continuing on this walk because
[1:36:46] that's that's the
[1:36:47] the patience of god is in me god's
[1:36:50] patience
[1:36:50] right rejoicing in hope patient and
[1:36:53] tribulation continuing instant in prayer
[1:36:55] as soon as you read the word patience
[1:36:56] now if you want to go through your bible
[1:36:58] it's all through the bible and anyone
[1:37:00] that ever got anywhere had to have
[1:37:01] patience
[1:37:02] that's a critical component it's
[1:37:04] basically the back that's why i say it's
[1:37:05] the backbone of our christian walk is
[1:37:07] patience
[1:37:08] and that's why i say you know if you
[1:37:10] want to be an elder in a church the
[1:37:11] critical component
[1:37:12] is he a very patient person do they have
[1:37:14] the ability to stand
[1:37:16] and haven't done all to stand because if
[1:37:18] they if they don't have that critical
[1:37:20] component don't let them in they need to
[1:37:22] have this patience that
[1:37:24] you know it's nice to see brethren that
[1:37:26] are real believers that when things
[1:37:27] happen they just it's as though
[1:37:28] nothing's happening
[1:37:29] don't you realize all these things are
[1:37:30] going on that's all right it's a problem
[1:37:33] that's patience
[1:37:36] i'm going to go through a few of these i
[1:37:38] want to show you why i wrote this now
[1:37:41] and then i'm about to close after this
[1:37:45] patience proves patience persists in
[1:37:46] patients pays
[1:37:49] i want to show you why whoops why i
[1:37:51] coined that phrase here
[1:37:54] patience proves the reason why i wrote
[1:37:55] proves is because patience proves you
[1:37:57] know
[1:37:58] what the outcome will be and that you're
[1:38:00] acting on that
[1:38:03] right it the fact you've got patience
[1:38:05] shows that
[1:38:07] it's linked to some outcome you believe
[1:38:09] is achievable
[1:38:10] it proves like if you don't have
[1:38:12] patience then it means you don't think
[1:38:13] it's achievable
[1:38:14] you don't have patience for it so if
[1:38:18] if you're just if you're desiring
[1:38:20] something that even though it's not
[1:38:21] there and if you've
[1:38:22] got this patient desire in your heart
[1:38:24] for it that proves you actually believe
[1:38:25] it's attainable and you're going to get
[1:38:26] it
[1:38:27] otherwise you wouldn't have patience for
[1:38:28] it because the job of patience is to
[1:38:30] achieve that
[1:38:31] right this characteristic so that's why
[1:38:33] i say patience proves
[1:38:35] it proves that you know what the outcome
[1:38:37] will be like but this farmer here
[1:38:40] he he didn't mind patiently working on a
[1:38:43] field because he
[1:38:44] knew eventually he would reap the
[1:38:46] harvest he wasn't just
[1:38:47] aimlessly doing it like let's see if
[1:38:49] this works he was patiently pursuing it
[1:38:51] so
[1:38:52] and his actions proved that he knew he
[1:38:55] was going to get it
[1:38:56] because he patiently pursued it right so
[1:38:58] patience proves
[1:39:00] that we know we're going to get this
[1:39:01] thing
[1:39:03] and in any situation once you get the
[1:39:05] word of the lord on it it doesn't matter
[1:39:06] what it might look like
[1:39:08] once you get that patience that proves
[1:39:10] that it's going to be all right the
[1:39:11] outcome is going to be right it proves
[1:39:13] it
[1:39:14] i've just got i can just have patience
[1:39:16] now i can just it doesn't mean i stop it
[1:39:18] just means i've got patience
[1:39:20] i keep pressing on but i stop if you
[1:39:21] know what i mean like i i can rest up
[1:39:23] it's all going to be right but i'm
[1:39:24] pressing on
[1:39:26] it's sort of more what patience means
[1:39:28] now
[1:39:29] and now the job of patients is that it
[1:39:31] persists regardless of what the
[1:39:32] obstacles or resistance might be
[1:39:34] because once you get this thing called
[1:39:35] patience it just keeps going it doesn't
[1:39:37] it doesn't stop and say oh it's too hard
[1:39:39] it patience doesn't have that
[1:39:40] characteristic and it
[1:39:42] patience just pursues on through
[1:39:44] anything it doesn't it doesn't stop
[1:39:46] it actually doesn't stop it doesn't have
[1:39:48] a let's turn around
[1:39:50] no that's that's getting rid of patients
[1:39:52] patience doesn't turn around patients
[1:39:54] move forward
[1:39:54] all the time towards the objective it
[1:39:56] doesn't it's like the
[1:39:58] the the um the armor of the lord you
[1:40:00] know there's no protection on our back
[1:40:02] because we're not designed to turn
[1:40:03] around and go backwards it's probably
[1:40:04] the same as patience you know patience
[1:40:06] is designed to go one way and that's
[1:40:07] forward to
[1:40:08] achieve whatever it is it's trying to
[1:40:09] achieve in any particular way
[1:40:11] that's the that's that's patience and if
[1:40:14] you've got patience that's what you're
[1:40:15] going to do you're going to keep
[1:40:16] pressing on
[1:40:17] through anything because you've got
[1:40:18] patience everything's going wrong
[1:40:20] doesn't matter i've got patience i'm
[1:40:21] going to press on
[1:40:23] right that's that's the way patience is
[1:40:24] i'm going to take you through a few
[1:40:25] examples
[1:40:26] this is not the picture of the man but i
[1:40:29] the example of
[1:40:29] a few examples i thought of was the man
[1:40:32] that brother brown who said you know
[1:40:33] you're
[1:40:33] you're he was blind he went through the
[1:40:36] line and
[1:40:37] brought around and prayed for him and
[1:40:38] they said okay go now and you'll be well
[1:40:40] you know so he walked
[1:40:41] the other out the line and maybe off the
[1:40:43] stage and he was still blind he thought
[1:40:45] something's not right here the guy out
[1:40:46] there said i was going to be
[1:40:48] that i was well but i can't see you know
[1:40:50] there's something wrong here better i'll
[1:40:51] make my way back and i'll go through the
[1:40:53] line again just to figure out you know
[1:40:54] how i think you
[1:40:55] did you make a mistake or what's the
[1:40:56] story here i just need some
[1:40:57] clarification on
[1:40:59] what my you know on my stand so it goes
[1:41:01] back through
[1:41:03] and they says i was came through the
[1:41:05] line before and you said
[1:41:06] you know i was going to be well and
[1:41:07] everything was going to be fine but i'm
[1:41:08] still blind
[1:41:10] and i think brother brown said so what
[1:41:12] did you get told
[1:41:13] i got told i was going to be right
[1:41:14] everything's going to be well well then
[1:41:16] go on then everything's going to be
[1:41:17] right you're going to be well
[1:41:18] just go on your way rejoicing so now
[1:41:22] at some point patience clicked and he
[1:41:24] realized actually yes i'm going to be
[1:41:25] well
[1:41:26] now now he could patiently pursue that
[1:41:29] agenda of
[1:41:29] i'm going to be able to see at some
[1:41:31] point that's it so then this patience
[1:41:33] he received i'm going to say he received
[1:41:34] the patience of god he just something
[1:41:36] anchored in him
[1:41:37] okay then everything's all right then
[1:41:38] let's do this
[1:41:40] he may have been sitting down here but
[1:41:42] he was patiently pursuing
[1:41:44] the word of god that was promised to him
[1:41:45] he was patiently pursuing it
[1:41:47] sometimes he would sit and wait
[1:41:48] sometimes he would tell others
[1:41:50] praise the lord did you hear that i'm
[1:41:52] i've i was blind now i can see if you
[1:41:54] heard all about it you know this is the
[1:41:55] greatest news ever and you're still
[1:41:56] blind
[1:41:58] our patience it doesn't always sit down
[1:41:59] sometimes it presses on
[1:42:01] sometimes it sits down it does it
[1:42:02] doesn't matter what it does it's
[1:42:03] achieving some objective
[1:42:05] it doesn't matter how it achieves it
[1:42:06] it's just going to press on and achieve
[1:42:08] it
[1:42:09] and he he so he patiently pursued on
[1:42:12] towards his objective which was i'm
[1:42:13] going to see the promise of god come to
[1:42:15] pass in my life
[1:42:16] that i was given that i'm going to be
[1:42:17] made well so what do you think
[1:42:18] eventually happens to this man
[1:42:21] it gets made well because patience pays
[1:42:24] it will achieve its outcome that it's
[1:42:26] desiring for it doesn't
[1:42:27] it will keep going until it achieves it
[1:42:29] the minute it achieves it then it will
[1:42:30] stop
[1:42:30] okay the patience has achieved this
[1:42:33] that's what it does
[1:42:35] by long forbearing i'll do the one here
[1:42:37] through patience a ruler can be
[1:42:38] persuaded
[1:42:39] and a gentle tongue can break the bone i
[1:42:40] like that one through patience
[1:42:43] just keep at it or that other one says
[1:42:44] by long forbearing as a prince persuaded
[1:42:47] you know this is this may be a natural
[1:42:49] example but
[1:42:50] it shows you that this thing called
[1:42:51] patience you can just keep pushing
[1:42:54] and this thing called patience will
[1:42:55] eventually persuade a king i write that
[1:42:57] in here because this reminds me of this
[1:42:58] one
[1:42:59] you know you know the story about the
[1:43:00] woman that she felt like she was
[1:43:03] and things had been unjustly done
[1:43:06] towards her i'll just paraphrase it
[1:43:08] and she felt like what happened to me
[1:43:10] was not good and i need to go and see
[1:43:11] the judge and tell him about what
[1:43:13] happened because
[1:43:14] when i lay out my facts before him he'll
[1:43:16] realize yes you were wronged
[1:43:17] and then i'll you know however i was
[1:43:21] wrong you'll
[1:43:21] you'll pass your judgment and i'll get
[1:43:23] justice but the judge wasn't interested
[1:43:26] in hearing a case because he was a
[1:43:27] corrupt judge he was like
[1:43:28] not saying the laws but you know he he
[1:43:30] was probably too busy spending his money
[1:43:32] that he being paid being a judge and
[1:43:33] going doing other things not really
[1:43:34] doing his job which is what a lot of
[1:43:37] you know people as they get more status
[1:43:38] they start to not do their job they
[1:43:40] they enjoy the fruits of it anyway so
[1:43:43] but she was patiently pursuing her
[1:43:45] agenda which was i want justice
[1:43:47] now the bible said that even though the
[1:43:49] the judge here was
[1:43:51] unjust he didn't really care about you
[1:43:52] he just got sick of her pursuing it
[1:43:54] so eventually he said okay what do you
[1:43:56] want just give her what she wants i'm
[1:43:57] tired of this
[1:43:58] person pursuing me she's wearing me down
[1:44:01] give her what she wants now that's not
[1:44:04] to say the laws of that but that but the
[1:44:06] lord uses as an example this is what
[1:44:07] patients when we patiently pursue
[1:44:09] something this is what it will do we'll
[1:44:10] just keep on going keep on going keep on
[1:44:12] going it doesn't just give up
[1:44:13] she had patience she knew i'm going to
[1:44:15] achieve this outcome
[1:44:16] eventually i'm going to get justice so
[1:44:18] she had just this patience in her just
[1:44:20] kept on pursuing her agenda which was
[1:44:22] i want justice eventually she got it
[1:44:24] because of her
[1:44:25] she patiently endured for it another one
[1:44:29] here which was the woman that had the
[1:44:31] daughter and the other and and she went
[1:44:33] to the lord
[1:44:35] and all the time the disciples were like
[1:44:36] i go away she's just trying to get and
[1:44:38] she's trying to um
[1:44:39] jump the cue you know get back get back
[1:44:40] and they were pushing her back and
[1:44:42] eventually they got to jesus and said oh
[1:44:44] there's this woman she's always she's
[1:44:45] trying to you know she's
[1:44:46] she's actually been a bit of a pain
[1:44:47] she's trying to come up and see us it
[1:44:49] reminds me of the story of brother
[1:44:50] branham with the the
[1:44:51] woman that had the dead baby you know
[1:44:54] and she was
[1:44:56] at some point during the day of the day
[1:44:57] before she got this
[1:44:59] the patience of gods anchored in her
[1:45:01] heart and she thought i've got to get
[1:45:02] this baby to that man
[1:45:03] to pray if i get him to that man to pray
[1:45:05] then he'll come back my baby will come
[1:45:06] back to life
[1:45:07] something anchored in here and she was
[1:45:09] she didn't patiently pursue her
[1:45:11] agenda she aggressively pursued her
[1:45:13] agenda she was
[1:45:14] god had this dead baby running through
[1:45:16] the crowds and causing all this fuss you
[1:45:18] can imagine maybe there was a big crowd
[1:45:20] and brother brown was preaching and over
[1:45:21] in this corner there was all this
[1:45:22] commotion of all these people and
[1:45:24] they're trying to hold this woman back
[1:45:25] and she's throwing these guys away and
[1:45:26] throwing this one away and
[1:45:28] maybe these brothers feel a bit bad
[1:45:29] grabbing on to this woman so they're
[1:45:30] kind of like trying to stop her but
[1:45:31] they're not sure she knows that she's
[1:45:32] he's exploiting the situation
[1:45:34] these christian brothers aren't going to
[1:45:35] wrestle me to the ground they're
[1:45:36] christians
[1:45:37] if i just be aggressive enough they'll
[1:45:38] get out the way and even to where
[1:45:41] brother brown said look she doesn't
[1:45:42] really
[1:45:42] and that word got back to him and he
[1:45:44] actually said look she doesn't really
[1:45:45] know who i am
[1:45:46] just why don't you guys go down and pray
[1:45:48] for her you know i'll just carry on you
[1:45:49] know because
[1:45:50] just as a natural solution to the
[1:45:52] situation because he had to keep on
[1:45:53] preaching he said just
[1:45:55] just don't pray for her she don't know
[1:45:56] it's not me you know not tell her lies
[1:45:58] but
[1:45:58] you know but you know her patience was
[1:46:01] greater than that because it was the
[1:46:02] godly patience there was a
[1:46:04] god god's patience actually come into
[1:46:06] her and
[1:46:08] and it had to eventually move brother
[1:46:11] branham
[1:46:11] you know because then then they tried to
[1:46:14] do that but she was she wasn't going to
[1:46:15] have that she still kept on coming on
[1:46:18] and then a vision broke out and brother
[1:46:20] brown saw this woman with a baby
[1:46:22] she said well hang on hang on her
[1:46:24] patience has actually had actually
[1:46:25] caused the
[1:46:26] vision to come on and something more to
[1:46:28] happen above the situation
[1:46:29] said hang on hang on where's that lady
[1:46:32] where's that lady with the baby i just
[1:46:33] saw a vision of a lady with a
[1:46:35] baby and a baby coming back to like
[1:46:36] where is she patience has made it made
[1:46:38] it all the way through it had
[1:46:39] just pressed on and made it it wasn't
[1:46:41] because she pushed them in away
[1:46:43] it was because she believed and that
[1:46:45] patience
[1:46:46] she anchored in and she just patiently
[1:46:48] pursued that
[1:46:49] but it was god's agenda and it just it
[1:46:51] made its way through to the
[1:46:52] gates of heaven and the doors opened up
[1:46:54] and said yep let this promising
[1:46:56] you know let it in and and let the
[1:46:58] spirit go go out
[1:46:59] and and fulfill the promise fulfill the
[1:47:02] desire that she has you know so
[1:47:03] it came down and then what happened
[1:47:05] patience pays her baby came back to life
[1:47:09] it also means other things but peter
[1:47:11] said unto him although all shall be
[1:47:12] offended yet will not i
[1:47:14] he now we think well i thought patience
[1:47:17] just means i get a good thing but
[1:47:18] in the end peter peter's in sorry to
[1:47:21] change it so
[1:47:22] drastically but peter's end of his
[1:47:23] ministry was hung upside down
[1:47:25] and crucified but he had an agenda to
[1:47:28] see the word of god go forth
[1:47:30] come want me and hey he would have
[1:47:32] thought the most to himself
[1:47:33] i gotta i've got to go out sooner or
[1:47:35] later
[1:47:37] hey why not go out in a blaze of glory
[1:47:42] why not you know that his patience
[1:47:45] he endured all sorts of things and at
[1:47:46] the end it endured through this
[1:47:48] i was reading last night guys that were
[1:47:51] got the electric chair you know they
[1:47:53] would
[1:47:54] when they were they would be sentenced
[1:47:55] to death or something and they would
[1:47:56] they were saying about how the electric
[1:47:57] chair didn't really work
[1:47:58] sometimes they would sometimes take 30
[1:48:01] seconds or a minute for the person to
[1:48:02] die and very gruesome
[1:48:03] i don't know how people can have a death
[1:48:04] penalty still it's just
[1:48:06] how can someone condemn another person
[1:48:09] to death i don't care what the person's
[1:48:10] done
[1:48:11] that's not how man wasn't given that
[1:48:13] jurisdiction to kill another man
[1:48:15] it's barbaric any country that does it
[1:48:17] is barbaric
[1:48:19] lock him up and pay for him fine yeah
[1:48:21] let's pay who cares
[1:48:22] oh he's going to cost a hundred thousand
[1:48:24] 200 000 i don't care pay the money we
[1:48:26] can't just kill people
[1:48:27] we don't we we can't i'm another man
[1:48:30] they're a man and woman we can't kill
[1:48:32] them it's not how it works
[1:48:33] just put that out there i just when you
[1:48:35] read about you think do we still kill
[1:48:36] people
[1:48:37] we think it's right i'm going to kill
[1:48:38] you it's never right
[1:48:41] but anyway i had this electric chair and
[1:48:42] they they said it's funny you know
[1:48:46] most people this one guy that was a
[1:48:49] serial killer you know he was all sort
[1:48:50] of
[1:48:51] thought he was arrogant and everything
[1:48:53] in the when he was in court and everyone
[1:48:54] was paying attention to him he was all
[1:48:56] arrogant and that
[1:48:57] you know but when the time came to walk
[1:48:59] the path from the
[1:49:00] the prison to the electric chair then he
[1:49:02] all felt he fell apart because he knew
[1:49:04] this was the end you know
[1:49:05] and he and they did say that a lot of
[1:49:07] people when they're at that phase they
[1:49:08] stay out they break down
[1:49:10] they can't handle it they said even a
[1:49:11] lot of them they they give them
[1:49:13] drugs like these days inject them with
[1:49:15] sedatives and that to
[1:49:16] so they won't worry so they can not be
[1:49:19] hysterical when they're going to
[1:49:20] to their end you know that's a man
[1:49:23] that's going to the room with no
[1:49:24] patience
[1:49:26] but peter had patience lord
[1:49:29] i'm gonna i'm gonna patiently pursue
[1:49:31] through this if this if this is the
[1:49:32] agenda then this is where we're going
[1:49:35] and then he even said look hang me
[1:49:36] upside down the lord was hung this way
[1:49:39] hang me upside down that's why they
[1:49:40] flipped them around see but that was
[1:49:42] he had an agenda the patience is a very
[1:49:46] powerful thing
[1:49:47] a very powerful it's it's a driving
[1:49:50] force of our christian
[1:49:51] walk to pursue the agenda of the lord
[1:49:53] regardless of what the circumstance
[1:49:55] now this is my last one patience pays
[1:49:58] you the outcome you're patiently waiting
[1:49:59] for
[1:50:00] yes so i say patience proves that you
[1:50:02] believe it patience persists in patients
[1:50:04] pace
[1:50:05] coin that phrase that's the truth
[1:50:09] but i wanted to just change it more to
[1:50:10] be like this you know because i don't
[1:50:11] want to make it like
[1:50:12] it's a natural you know 10 steps to
[1:50:14] achieving things this is not what this
[1:50:16] is about
[1:50:17] we need god's patience that the patience
[1:50:19] that's associated with the spirit of god
[1:50:21] like that that is him
[1:50:22] we get that patience it's that patience
[1:50:24] that proves you know it's that patience
[1:50:26] that persists
[1:50:27] it's that patience that pays god never
[1:50:29] does anything hit and miss he never
[1:50:31] he never tries something at all that
[1:50:32] didn't work we often as men and women
[1:50:34] have schemes and we try to scheme and it
[1:50:35] completely fails we're like
[1:50:37] whoops didn't realize this would happen
[1:50:38] and we fail god doesn't have schemes and
[1:50:41] plans that he goes out to try and
[1:50:42] achieve and it fails
[1:50:43] all his plans work so what we need is to
[1:50:46] surrender to his spirit and to get his
[1:50:48] his patience lord put give me your
[1:50:49] patience and that's linked to his will
[1:50:52] and to his word and then let me pursue
[1:50:54] that let that patience come in me and
[1:50:55] let that be the driving force of my life
[1:50:57] that i'm patiently pursuing your will
[1:50:59] let that be the driving force of my life
[1:51:02] i've got one more testimony then i'm
[1:51:04] going to close on this here just because
[1:51:05] i think
[1:51:06] it may it may or may not be an
[1:51:08] encouragement but
[1:51:10] this is what happened excuse me when i
[1:51:13] was getting to
[1:51:16] if you it if you know me you know i've
[1:51:19] got this
[1:51:20] my young fellow that i that we have a
[1:51:24] uh interesting
[1:51:27] dynamic between us right he's he's um
[1:51:31] like i really love him he's a he's a
[1:51:32] nice guy but it's been in the most
[1:51:34] interesting
[1:51:36] interesting but eye-opening experience i
[1:51:38] never knew the effects of satan's
[1:51:40] the effects that satan's lives can have
[1:51:41] on a person's life
[1:51:43] until i watched this thing unfold
[1:51:46] like and i suppose i could say like this
[1:51:50] because from a young person i've always
[1:51:52] had a desire to serve the lord
[1:51:53] so i've always in a general sense let
[1:51:56] the word of god govern my
[1:51:58] mind even though when i wasn't fully
[1:52:00] serving him i still let the word of god
[1:52:02] govern my my actions so i didn't do
[1:52:06] anything
[1:52:06] drastically too bad because i still had
[1:52:09] this i was brought up a christian but
[1:52:10] also i had a desire to have this word of
[1:52:11] god in my mind
[1:52:12] and that was enough to keep me out of a
[1:52:14] lot of trouble because the word of god
[1:52:17] is truth and it will actually lead us
[1:52:18] the right direction in life to be
[1:52:20] successful right
[1:52:21] you don't even have to be saved to live
[1:52:22] a successful life based on the word of
[1:52:23] god you can actually
[1:52:25] that's why they say if you just even if
[1:52:28] god doesn't exist if you just supply the
[1:52:29] godly principles to your life and
[1:52:31] live like that you'll have a better life
[1:52:32] anyway so you're
[1:52:34] you're scientifically speaking
[1:52:37] you're theoretically better just to be a
[1:52:39] christian whether it's true or not
[1:52:40] that's what they worked out you know
[1:52:41] because the outcome is better anyway
[1:52:43] then if you don't do it so no i'm not
[1:52:44] saying it's not true what i'm saying
[1:52:46] so you so you can live your life like i
[1:52:49] live my life growing up and i i kind of
[1:52:53] stayed out of a lot of trouble because i
[1:52:54] would still have this word of god
[1:52:55] governing me when i was going to do
[1:52:56] something about i think no hang on the
[1:52:57] word of god would say to do that so i'd
[1:52:59] veer away from that and go this way
[1:53:01] right that's that's how i would and a
[1:53:02] lot of things i got out of
[1:53:04] by the grace that's only the grace of
[1:53:05] god but
[1:53:07] so i was naive a bit to the power that
[1:53:10] satan's lies have to
[1:53:12] govern somebody's life and to
[1:53:15] direct their life in a certain way and
[1:53:18] to steal someone
[1:53:19] and to lead them on a path that they
[1:53:22] actually don't really want to go but if
[1:53:24] you lie to someone enough and they're
[1:53:25] convinced
[1:53:26] and they believe a lie they will go on a
[1:53:27] certain path believing a lie and
[1:53:30] their whole objective and everything
[1:53:31] within them will go on that path but
[1:53:33] it's based on a lie
[1:53:34] very powerful i never realized the power
[1:53:36] that lies have
[1:53:37] until i watch this unfold i'm like well
[1:53:39] because but i know eventually one day
[1:53:41] those lies will be revealed
[1:53:43] and you will see that you were being
[1:53:46] told lies
[1:53:47] and that your actions you acted on these
[1:53:49] lies and that's what brought you to that
[1:53:50] path because that's all it is
[1:53:51] that's how satan works by telling us
[1:53:53] lies that's how you if you look back on
[1:53:55] your own life all of your
[1:53:56] times you've gone astray has been based
[1:53:58] on a lie you've been told or you've
[1:53:59] followed a certain direction
[1:54:01] see if we always follow the word of god
[1:54:02] we won't get into that situation
[1:54:04] every one of you could look back on in
[1:54:06] your life and realize that right so
[1:54:07] these
[1:54:08] these lies are very powerful things but
[1:54:11] they
[1:54:11] but it causes a lot of trouble you know
[1:54:13] in someone where it just
[1:54:15] it causes no end to trouble and i'm part
[1:54:17] um
[1:54:18] irish i'm basically irish and part maori
[1:54:21] so my
[1:54:23] my um my natural way of dealing with
[1:54:25] things if i cut my little
[1:54:27] pipe you know i get mad i'm just like
[1:54:31] yeah you know it took me a long time to
[1:54:34] not be mad you know but that's that's
[1:54:35] that's my natural my natural carnal man
[1:54:37] just gets angry and i just
[1:54:39] it's all on man thanks thankfully for
[1:54:42] the grace of god you know his temperance
[1:54:44] comes in but that's that's how that's my
[1:54:47] natural
[1:54:48] my father was in like biking gangs and
[1:54:50] stuff that's sort of the
[1:54:51] we come from a very good lineage you
[1:54:53] know
[1:54:55] so let's just say there's been this this
[1:54:58] we have a colorful relationship david
[1:55:00] and i you know very colorful because i'm
[1:55:02] venomously opposed to what he's doing
[1:55:04] and he vehemently wants to go that way
[1:55:05] and we vehemently disagree with each
[1:55:07] other and
[1:55:08] we get mad you know so um
[1:55:12] and it's it's created so many so much
[1:55:15] interesting thoughts in my mind you know
[1:55:16] now
[1:55:16] i've it's taken me a while to realize
[1:55:20] to actually come before the lord and say
[1:55:21] lord i've just completely failed and i
[1:55:23] cannot achieve
[1:55:24] a good outcome in this because up until
[1:55:25] that point too you think so far in life
[1:55:27] i've done pretty well i've managed to
[1:55:30] maneuver things the right way and i'm
[1:55:31] doing pretty good and things are going
[1:55:33] all right so i can probably do this one
[1:55:34] too
[1:55:35] and it was the first time in my life
[1:55:37] that i said lord i actually completely
[1:55:39] felt and i do not have
[1:55:40] any answers to achieve the outcome that
[1:55:42] i want i do not have any answers at all
[1:55:45] i'm just this is a it was a very good
[1:55:48] place to be because you realize i'm
[1:55:49] completely
[1:55:50] i i do not have any ability to achieve a
[1:55:53] good outcome here
[1:55:54] i'm just i'm totally done i've pulled
[1:55:56] out all the tricks you know
[1:55:58] i've done every trick in the book you
[1:55:59] know my trick bag is empty
[1:56:01] and the result is still negative i've
[1:56:04] completely failed and i do not have the
[1:56:06] answers to achieve this
[1:56:07] great place to be because that's when
[1:56:09] god can start to work you know
[1:56:11] and then great great lessons to learn
[1:56:13] because then you start applying it to
[1:56:14] other things you think well i'll just
[1:56:16] let's just let's just take that step
[1:56:18] from the start let's not take a long
[1:56:19] time to get there in situations let's
[1:56:20] just start in that situation lord
[1:56:22] i don't know you do the situation we can
[1:56:24] apply that to anywhere in our life you
[1:56:25] know but
[1:56:26] that was where i got to in that
[1:56:27] situation and
[1:56:30] but you know this this the lord's been
[1:56:32] dealing with this you know i'm i'm
[1:56:36] you get to a point where you know
[1:56:37] actually lord is going to be all right
[1:56:38] and
[1:56:39] you surrender it all and you know that
[1:56:40] you start to have this this page this
[1:56:42] but i didn't know it's patience but
[1:56:44] something builds up and
[1:56:47] he was over the other day he usually
[1:56:49] comes over to get food you know
[1:56:50] he runs out of money but he didn't he
[1:56:52] did eat heaps of food but he reckoned he
[1:56:53] didn't come around for food he came
[1:56:54] around say hello
[1:56:56] so but have food in the process
[1:56:59] and about a 20 minute shower probably
[1:57:00] didn't shower for four days no hot water
[1:57:02] where is that
[1:57:03] no he's alright so he was there and i
[1:57:06] actually had gone out and i come back
[1:57:07] and he was still there and
[1:57:09] i know shannon had a nice time with him
[1:57:11] just talking and and um
[1:57:13] i found out afterwards some things that
[1:57:14] she said but you know i can
[1:57:16] i sort of have a i have a cutoff point i
[1:57:19] shouldn't say this but i'm being honest
[1:57:20] i have a cut-off point with my
[1:57:21] interactions with him because it's like
[1:57:22] okay
[1:57:22] i'm to leave now and like just let you
[1:57:24] chill because i'm probably going to
[1:57:26] burst the main because i get frustrated
[1:57:27] i'm like i'm going to great to see you
[1:57:29] bro i'm going to go back and i've got a
[1:57:30] bit of stuff to do actually at a sermon
[1:57:31] to get rid i've got to get a sermon
[1:57:32] ready bro
[1:57:33] you know good to see you man i actually
[1:57:35] meant it but
[1:57:36] i shouldn't say it like that is that all
[1:57:37] right okay that's bad
[1:57:43] i regulate it you know because someone
[1:57:46] close to you
[1:57:47] easily like i wouldn't pop with you guys
[1:57:49] because
[1:57:50] i'm not as close to you but i pop easily
[1:57:52] with people that are closest to me so
[1:57:54] it's a good challenge
[1:57:55] but now i've learned okay when i start
[1:57:57] to get a bit i just hey man good to see
[1:57:59] you
[1:57:59] i'm out so i went back and then
[1:58:02] but i also wanted him to catch up with
[1:58:04] shannon for a bit and just talk you know
[1:58:06] because he was in quite a nice mood and
[1:58:08] um
[1:58:09] yeah and then i hadn't actually got this
[1:58:11] sort together but i just typed that word
[1:58:12] up on the
[1:58:14] this word here right on the my computer
[1:58:16] because i just had this little thought
[1:58:17] brewing
[1:58:18] and and he was about to leave and he
[1:58:21] he yells out from the where the doors
[1:58:25] are
[1:58:25] see you later dad was like and something
[1:58:27] in me thought
[1:58:29] go and see him because i was going to
[1:58:31] ask this guy yeah
[1:58:34] but something i felt okay go and see him
[1:58:36] and
[1:58:38] now if you know david he doesn't really
[1:58:40] like too much he's a bit like i don't do
[1:58:41] it
[1:58:42] he doesn't like any too sentimental you
[1:58:43] know but although he does but he wants
[1:58:45] to prove he doesn't
[1:58:46] so i was there and i walked out and
[1:58:49] somebody said to me give him a hug
[1:58:50] tell him you love him you know and he
[1:58:52] was he was there and
[1:58:54] i waited for him to do a shoe laces up
[1:58:55] and i said hey and i meant this i said
[1:58:57] hey it's good to see you bro
[1:58:59] i said come give me a hug and he's like
[1:59:00] yeah i gave him a hug i said i love you
[1:59:02] man
[1:59:03] he said i love you too dad and then i
[1:59:05] just saw in the corner of his eyes you
[1:59:06] know was sort of like
[1:59:07] real quick you know because he's got
[1:59:08] tears in his eyes you know but i kind of
[1:59:10] did too you know
[1:59:12] but any shot out the door see you bro so
[1:59:16] it was most interesting feeling because
[1:59:18] you know it was led by the spirit of god
[1:59:19] and there was things happening it was a
[1:59:20] powerful moment right
[1:59:22] and then i got to sit down on my
[1:59:23] computer and i look at the screen and it
[1:59:25] says this
[1:59:25] patience yeah i think yep
[1:59:28] this is going to happen no this i'm
[1:59:31] going to patiently pursue this because
[1:59:33] it's the promise of god
[1:59:34] this is going to happen and it felt like
[1:59:36] it all came alive
[1:59:38] and i found out afterwards that that
[1:59:39] because david when he was young used to
[1:59:41] randomly say to us all the time i love
[1:59:42] you've run in this car i love you guys
[1:59:44] you know just randomly
[1:59:45] and she actually said that to shane in
[1:59:47] the lounge i love you mom
[1:59:48] just out of the blue but you know
[1:59:52] i know that god has an agenda for him
[1:59:55] and it's not what i can see
[1:59:56] it's not god's agenda but it may be part
[1:59:58] of his plan right so i think i'm going
[2:00:00] to patiently pursue that agenda
[2:00:02] regardless of what we might see praise
[2:00:05] the lord thank you for um
[2:00:07] allowing me to share this little thought
[2:00:09] um with you all this morning

[2:09:49] brothers like brother isaac grow up
[2:10:03] just to see god working in people's
[2:10:06] lives
[2:10:08] you know as we get older and and have
[2:10:10] different roles like pastors
[2:10:14] satan will try us even
[2:10:19] we want spirit thicker than blood
[2:10:23] it can be hard
[2:10:27] we just want the best for each one of us
[2:10:29] to see us grow
[2:10:31] more to be like jesus christ
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:36] it's my desire you know last night we
[2:10:41] came down from tauranga and um
[2:10:44] just going on to the desert road the run
[2:10:47] in
[2:10:48] this um swan flew into the front
[2:10:51] windscreen and bam
[2:10:53] shattered windscreen um
[2:10:57] but my son is a glazier cane as his name
[2:11:01] and um that's where we're going so he's
[2:11:05] got the car to fix the
[2:11:07] fix the um
[2:11:11] the windscreen so we couldn't have been
[2:11:13] going to a better place
[2:11:15] um and
[2:11:18] um you know just listening to isaac
[2:11:22] we must be born again jesus said you
[2:11:24] must be born again then
[2:11:25] your patience is going to be directed
[2:11:29] towards being more like jesus christ
[2:11:32] we can have patience towards things of
[2:11:35] self and i've had them over the years
[2:11:38] but as you get older
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:41] i just thank the patience of god
[2:11:44] towards me
[2:11:45] [Music]
[2:11:48] and i just pray for each one of you here
[2:11:50] now and i pray
[2:11:52] you know i heard this testament i heard
[2:11:54] it before but
[2:11:55] corey team boone when she was in the
[2:11:57] concentration camp
[2:11:58] they were in a camp and it had fleas and
[2:12:02] she couldn't it's just the bets he was
[2:12:05] saying
[2:12:06] thank god and all things give thanks
[2:12:09] and she said i can't thank god for these
[2:12:12] fleas
[2:12:13] and you know the the guards wouldn't
[2:12:15] come in there
[2:12:16] in their heart because of the fleece so
[2:12:19] she could read the bible
[2:12:21] so if god knows
[2:12:24] about the fleece how much more he knows
[2:12:27] everything about you everything john
[2:12:31] everything amen and he loves us
[2:12:35] and so i just pray heavenly father

[2:12:41] just thank you for
[2:12:42] the perseverance the patience to come
[2:12:45] here today

[2:12:52] trying to learn those songs during the
[2:12:54] week i keep getting magic and promises
[2:12:56] round the wrong way

[2:13:02] your promises are true you just want us
[2:13:04] to
[2:13:05] be patient and press towards the mark of
[2:13:08] the high court
[2:13:09] and jesus christ every one of us walks
[2:13:12] in different shoes here
[2:13:14] you know each one by name and i know
[2:13:17] you'll go with each one
[2:13:18] today because i ask in your name
[2:13:24] you know without you i'm nothing each
[2:13:27] one of us is nothing
