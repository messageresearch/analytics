the house of the lord amen i believe room for a great time this morning we're going to meet the living god again and and do the thing that matters because you know all the stuff we have to do next

what we're doing here this morning matters the most out of anything in life meeting the living god so we're excited to be here and just have a great time and be amongst friends i was saying to brother ben this morning that i i just i felt the service last night was so inspired and so anointed and um you know we don't really do icebreaker services around here we just like the first service just starts we're just all into it because we're all just friends you know we all know each other we're all happy there's no resistance we just love the lord and we want to have a good time in the lord and we've made a big effort to be here so we're not just going to waste it by like holding back we want to meet god so that's that's that's what we're going to do this morning i mean so i'm going to invite brother ben up he's just going to come and say hello and um or my there is right there come up bro and then then we'll start some singing after that amen hello good morning god bless you it's great to see everyone here again today um praise the lord i trust you had a good rest and amen found the refreshing of the holy ghost last night and i it's brother isaac saying i believe we're in for another amazing service this morning by the age of administering to us and i'd also so i want to say welcome to you all but i also want to acknowledge the unseen audience here because you know unfortunately because of this covert situation we can only have 100 people on site and we tried to wrangle with the camp about staff to try and boost the numbers and all these things but you know it is what it is but you know there's a lot of people a lot of family because because we're all family right there's a lot of family who wanted to be here today and um so i just want to acknowledge them you know brother taswell and and sister laverne and the jeffrey's family uh they said they're gonna be logging in they wanted to be here so bad and so i'll say brother taswell family god bless you anyone else who's streaming god bless you we miss you we're looking forward to the day you know i think the first lockdown was me personally it was like a novelty last year but this one is just i say it's dumb you know in kiwi language but i feel like when when we can actually travel again there's going to be a lot of traveling just to see one another you know we had um last year uh was brother moore is he here yeah so brother mull was baptized and it was in a certain lockdown a state which we could kind of see each other but it was like you had to keep a bubble and all these things so i probably shouldn't be saying this publicly but it was like you could see the saints but you couldn't see the saints and it felt like it was like when the dead in christ you know they're they're just beyond the veil you know we can feel them we know the lord's here and you know we're excited but soon that bubble's going to be broken amen hallelujah but you as well acknowledge the unseen audience god bless you wish you could be here i know you want to be here too and one day we'll all be able to you know be together we were planning on having the big hall this year we were trying to strategize in these things but it is what it is with the lockdown but um yes i just want to say hello i just want to read a scripture that brother andy sent me in the week psalm 68 just just a few verses then we're going to go to prayer uh let god arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him that's the devil amen as smoke has driven away so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of god but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before god yeah let them exceedingly rejoice that's that's us hallelujah amen we sing unto the lord sing praises to his name extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is god in his holy habitation god setteth the solidarity in families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land oh god when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didest march through the wilderness sealer the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of god even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel thou o god did ascend a plentiful reign whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance when it was weary you know where the lord's inheritance he sent for the plentiful rain last night i believe it's going to rain again it may be sunny out there but it's going to be raining in here and also i could say it's sunny in here too because of the presence of the yes i win i mean so god bless you amen let's just um bow heads in the word of prayer open the service and let's just commit our mourning to the lord gracious heavenly father we want to thank you very much that we get this opportunity lord as brother isaac was saying that next

bit you know when you when there's all these people singing so i said to the band we've got to work hard to try and keep this thing moving along that's a musical thing and also there's so many people

sisters we are going to be tested on just what we've said yes do you believe that because storms are coming over the earth a prophet preached the oncoming storm and storms are political economic demon powers coming upon the earth and we have to be prepared and enter into what god has said he expects all of us in the storm is that right praise the lord i'm just going to wait for the brother to put the um the uh we're not going to sing any more songs we're just going thank you musicians i i want to bring out a subject today that is very um pertinent to this hour i really appreciate the uh the musicians and the and the the items brother ben i i thank the lord that uh you're a man of vision and uh coming into this church here it's just like being in our own church at home and and all the brethren send their their regards to you obviously we can't have too many people here because of the regulations but our god is in control is that right but how much have you allowed him to be in control amen beyond the veil of fear god bless you sister for singing that song and i want you to look at the theme don't get frightened by the thing not looking through these eyes but looking through these eyes is that right he says you look with your eyes but you see with your heart and we are a prophetic people we are eternal beings god did not make a mistake with you you are here in this day because god predestinated you to be in this day he placed an attribute in you for the year 2021. he did not put you in luther's day he did not put you in wesley's day they could not live in this day and you could not live in that day and a prophet comes along and says apostle paul wanted to live in this day but he could not live in this day because there was another people and brother bradley preached what paul preached is that right and we are living in a day where a prophet preached what paul preached and we're seeing the same thing that paul saw and paul saw into another dimension as that right he saw beyond the curtain of time and a prophet went to that place because we're living in a day he says our the holy ghost has come to connect you to your reality the holy ghost in this day and the prophet preaches this is matching time our earthly walk matching our reality praise the lord that's good i like to see people who are right into it amen right while we're standing and obviously we are let me get my get my bearings here i got to get these machines all cranked up and it's going to get into some heavy duty stuff and now i don't preach about hugging the dog and kissing the cat i'm just i'm a kind of person i get right into it you know now brother branham said 42 times it's lighter than what you think is that right and in 1965 when he went away i was eight years old to don't calculate what my age is but the thing is that it was actually tame in 1965 but the seeds were already laying in the people tomorrow i want to show you by the grace of god what is causing the world to go stark raving mad but not today all right let's read the scriptures now we're going to look at the events that happened in the second fold of the rapture cycle amen we if you've had a new birth you've already heard the shout a message has come forth is that right and an anointing to bring you to where the fresh food is and where the eagle food is that's where everybody is coming to that's elected and so we're in that second part of the rapture cycle by a new birth and god has taken us through a transformation from the earthly to the heavenly from an earthly economics and how would you say economy to a supernatural economy praise the lord oh my goodness me it can really start to burn you up but he's changing you for one thing to the other thing but we're at a junction time and he says that a junction time a trumpet is sounding causing a spiritual war but it's not just a spiritual war out there it's a spiritual war in here praise the lord by faith by revelation moses who was in a first exodus is that right refused he refused an earthly identity is that right refuse to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter see when i put these things in black up there that's what i'm meaning all right he refused being trapped in an earthly identity choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season because he knew that the world was falling apart is that right this world's falling apart if it fell apart in the first exodus it falls apart in the second exodus and so god must get our identity connected to him and this third exodus because we're not going from egypt to a promised land like moses did we're going from an earthly to a heavenly dimension beyond the curtain of time praise the lord you're with me still esteeming the reproach of the seventh seal oh my goodness me oh that will make the pharisees upset greater rich riches than the treasures of egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward for he forsook egypt not fearing what the people in power were putting into law is that what it says well i'm reading between the lines not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who was invisible so you mean i can see something invisible it looks like a paradox how could you see something that's invisible praise the lord god has brought you into a message to break the amnesia to show you you had fellowship with them before the foundation of the world is that right is that right do you believe that so if that is true in your theophany you are looking to this day yes and god has come down to have the same kind of worship he had with you before the foundation of the world but this is identification worship praise the lord this is heavenly lord you put a ministry on this earth lord all over the earth a five-fold ministry and i'm only just one small part of it brother alpha's a small part of it brother ben and all the other brothers and brothers that are ministers a small part of it and lord you said a prophet he's a watchman but you said also the fivefold ministry is a watchman and they are seeing what was spoken by a prophet and thus standing in a high place watching and seeing modern events being made real by scriptures that have been vindicated modern events been made clear by vindicated prophecy i pray lord come today lord i gotta get out of the way for this because it's too much for me humanly to preach it but i pray lord i give you the preeminences take over this vessel for your glory i ask in jesus name amen you may be seated now when moses was here in the first exodus of course he was in the first exodus he was living within the time of a superpower one that did not know joseph a superpower in this day does not know jesus christ and when you see a power that's there that does not know christ you know the world is going to fall apart but i want to tell you something brothers and sisters as this world is falling apart you are not falling apart he said everything consists by the word of god but when the god word of god is removed the world falls apart but when the word of god is received everything is established amen now observe what's happening to the world what is causing the world to fall apart you are you troublemakers because he said as a faith civilization comes up this civilization goes down so as god is bringing you to your true identity you are causing the world to fall apart so what does that make you the most important people on the earth so then why should we have fear but there's too much fear amongst the brethren and fear is going to go by the time these meetings are over i always say to the ministers give the devil no mercy is that right no mercy amen glory but moses esteemed the reproach of the seventh seal more than the treasures of egypt more than the treasures of a job more than the treasures of ambition more than the treasures of your own agenda he astined the reproach of that seventh seer and the seventh seal came to do something in your life because the seventh seal is a threefold mystery that's in the back part of god's mind and that seventh seal mystery picks up the people to fulfill that mystery and your eye people picked up by god praise the lord you're not an accident is that right so don't go around thinking that you're an accident because you're not an accident but the devil tries to get into people's minds and talk them out of the most important people on the earth is that right he tries to talk you out of it he gets into your mind got the greatest battle ever thoughts in the minds praise the lord but he was pressure tested amen you need pressure testing because he says pressure testing brings the best out inside of you and i tell you something brothers and sisters god is making this age so difficult i didn't say the devil i said god has designed this age so there's no way for you to use your own self anymore amen and i say praise god for that because we're living in a day of obstacles everywhere you go there's obstacles here political obstacles are religious obstacles but i want to ask you who permitted the obstacles to be there god dead praise the lord right let's go and we'll turn now to some of these things i want you to get a good grasping on this i'm going to do a teaching time i'm not an evangelist brother alphas are an evangelist and if i had to preach like him i'll be half dead already because i don't have the energy for that kind of thing i really appreciate that i really appreciate that fella now watch don't get these thoughts out of your head for by him by the lord yes all things are created there's good things and evil things you say god created evil i'll show you scripture in a moment that are in heaven that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones dominions principalities dictators feminists in power i'm ever getting heart palpitations already or powers all things were created by him and all and he is before all things and by him all things consist [Applause] so if that is so why do we have fear come on now we're going to beat the spear out and he's the head of the body and i want you to notice now if you read the crisis the mystery of god revealed it's all about the seventh seal is that right go and read it again and again and again and again because when you have it you think you've got it you haven't got it properly yet because you still got fear so go and read it again god is in full control and he's the head of the body the church now he's speaking about the second fold of the rapture who was the beginning the first one i did and that all things he might have preeminence over me and over you he's got to bring you to a place under the second fold of the rapture where you become a complete prisoner to him and a supernatural economy that you don't run you don't run it he does it praise the lord now watch now he's telling us that he's put on the earth all that is good all that is evil comes by him now watch you don't believe it watch this thing i form the light create the darkness i make peace and create evil this white man is not lying [Music] i the lord do all these things so if he created the evil and he put it there for a purpose he put it there to bring you to perfection the prophet said there's coming a squeeze upon the earth and that squeeze is not a grab when i was in in another country some bros been a bunch of smart addicts they came up to me they held a snake it was a constrictor and they put it on my arm and it wrapped around my arm and you know i don't like snakes at all and it wrapped around my this thing didn't have fangs but it was a constrictor and went around my arm i thought and i've got a white arm but it was turning purple and it was squeezing and squeezing and squeezing and squeezing and my arm was losing its blood supply by the snake and i said bros get this thing off now i i was holding its head like this i didn't want it to have tail i haven't had a bite out of my shoes and it looked at me and hated me and i looked at it i said my i hate you get this thing off and as i pulled it off me it messed all over my arms now let's go i thought it could get its own back i'll tell you something we won't go there after this you sound we've got to come up higher now brethren after what the church changes is that right revelation chapter three is laodicea the legacy is still here in the spirit okay the church ages are over is that right it's finished he said he was in the church ages the high priest of our confession and he was he was interceding for the ignorance of the people the church ages are over and there's no more mercy in them but mercy is still here where is mercy where the word is he's still our high priest but outside of the word he's not a high priest he's a judge but he's our husband praise the lord it's the marriage of the lamb not the marriage of the lion is that right he's not a judge to us because we've already passed from death to life we've already had our white throne of judgment is that right the white throne of judgment is not for us we're already had it we've already been judged pure by the word a spotless bride praise the lord now you are a people of prophecy and everyone's going to get right into this caught up into the present tense of this day and you should be able to see the threefold rapture materializing all around you i hope you can not by using your eyes by using seventh seal eyes eyes that come from god eyes that is eternal eyes and there's something moving us there's something that and and we need to be stabilized and what stabilizes us is when we catch god's vision is that right don't use your own vision use god's vision praise the lord now let's look at this threefold so that those who are just young ones in this message can get some grasping the threefold mystery of god now i've combined the seventh seal and the rapture together this is actually just different expressions of the same thing they're right i shout as a message coming forth revealing of the son of man your husband to be now if he reveals himself he must reveal you also is that right he must he must come down and lift the seals off of your life to show you you're not earthly people but heavenly people because when you're born on the earth you're born under six seals earthly seals and you did everything that the devil wanted you to do the devil said dance you dance you ask them how long do i dance for you were born on the influence of six seals but he came down to break the seal over your life and to bring back he has the eternal thought into you he already had the eternal thought of you but he had to bring the eternal thought laying in you into expression after a new birth you come into this place here and that's a place of transformation amen and god is dealing with us at a particular junction in our life authority given to the elect through submission and prisonership to him god does not want your hands on your life anymore don't plan it i was a farmer god interrupted my farming i was never going to go in the pulpit and i hated the thought of ever standing in public and preaching because i couldn't speak for a starter because of all the problems i had in my life he interrupted my life he interrupts your life he interrupts every aspect of your life because he wants complete control so he can care for you he cares do you i'm not trying to be a poet now watch now let's just wave these quotes you want to dance you want to provoke the devil dangle a quote right in front of his nostrils now christ is a mystery of god revealed amen and so many pharisees in the message don't believe the seventh seal is here now he said just look at the red there that's the reason under our seventh seal mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence but let's read the rest and he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is a revelation of god's mystery in christ said the entire bible is an expression of one god goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type so if i want to see me i have to step into the footsteps of somebody that's already in the bible and and and god is revealing in my life what somebody has already done in shadow form and when i can see myself in the word my footsteps in the word of god i get perfect faith because perfect faith could not be preached to the seals were revealed he preached faith and pulsations of faith before the seals did he preach perfect faith because perfect faith comes by knowing your position in the word is that right and then he says and expressing god's great goal what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it now we're going to look contrast in the second fold folder the rapture are you with me so far does it tell you something you won't fall asleep i'm notorious for keeping people awake now watch this amazing quote and i bet you you all never saw it i didn't see it till the other day but there's one word i want you to see in it watch this now laid this here has a three-fold fall and we have a three-fold rapture but latest here falls in three phases and you have to see what's happening out there now watch the words of the prophet he says we'll go at the red jesus said in the third chapter of revelation that the laddesean church the ladies here church is the last church age and we are all believing that we're in the end time and this is the last church age this season 963 now compare this church age with that rich young ruler now he says compare them but did you do it oh my if you do you will know everything going on around you remember you're a prophetic people and a prophet says compare them now something just uh flew out of the bible the other day at me got me clean between the eyes i saw the rapture and something you'd never see the rapture in and you cannot see the rapture from genesis to revelation unless god comes and shows you because it's a revelation and you cannot learn it you can look at scriptures for a hundred years and never see what's in it until he comes praise the lord now watch this now you have to get the continuity of the scriptures so now this the what i'm going to show you now the lord is speaking about someone now he's got it in his thoughts and he's bringing something out and those bros that are listening to him think he's talking about something that's happening in their day but he's prophesying all right now watch this man he represents laodicea and you must see this and if you don't see this you will not be able to identify everything going on around you and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully this is laodicea this is this age and he thought within himself saying what shall i do now the see has now been taken over by satan watch what satan said in isaiah chapter 14 i will i will i will i will i'll exalt myself above the saints of god i will and what is this man saying i will i will i will because because hell has come up on the earth and satan does not change his nature amen you're with me now watch now and he thought with himself what shall i do see it's i i i me me me because i have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all the fruits and my goods and i will say to my soul thou has much goods lay up for many years take thy ease eat drink and be merry and god said you fool i want to say to you laid this here you full you're so stupid you turned down the day of your visitation amen so now jesus is going to enter and he's going to show the next scriptures you must catch the continuity because he's talking about laodicea collapsing and we'll take this in detail in a moment laser collapsing in three stages then he comes and he talks to the elect so now he's talking about a certain rich young man and his this this this this man he this man types this world out here falling in three stages while the bride is going up in three stages are you with me now now watch he has just spoken about the rich young ruler now this is your part now hang on to your seats put some foreign skirts watch what he says and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you who's in the age of a three-four-four of laodicea take no thought for your life he's talking about another economy coming up yes is that right where one plus one equals 29 if it has to amen take no thought for your life what you shall eat neither for the body the what you put on neither for your career neither for your job neither for anything he said he will take control of it take no thought for life is more than meat and the body is more than raymond and so you listen to the news media and the news media tells you a different story are you going to listen to the news media those bunch of serpents said the white horse rider is a news media is that right or you got to listen to what the word says because too many of you listen to the news media and you don't listen to what the prophet said that's why you've got fear on you is that right cnn says this is so just a bunch of serpents i didn't say i was polite i'm just saying it the way that it is consider now the ravens that was talking about his creation that never fell for they neither sow nor which neither have store houses nor barn and god feeds them how much more ye better than the fowls see when i come in the pulpit i'm telling you something's coming like a locomotive i don't go and preach a historical god i preach what is coming and god always goes ahead of the problem and prepares the people so when the problem comes you already got what's needed [Applause] i consider myself better than a stupid choc and which of you taking thought can add stature to your stature one cubit okay i i want to be handsome i'm afraid i'm not i can't add one part to myself i am made very thin because god wants me that way god has made each one of you perfect and you can't change your stature you can go and put some face lift on these landslides it's not god is not interested and you're trying to change one thing i will your thoughts like to run ahead of god all right he says slow down woman you're getting ahead of the lord the woman follows the man is that right you got to get it into his right order praise the lord he's our headship he doesn't want that woman you know getting ahead of him if you then be not able to do a thing which is at least why take your thought for the rest you can't do nothing you can't change it everything's stamped in prophecy now right you can't change the prophecy so you have to go and adjust yourself to the prophecy praise the lord he's now he's talking about the botany life now i talked about the animal life you talk about the body life see he's going through the book of genesis see because who was he is the creator he's the one who created the heavens and the earth now he's talking about genesis to the elect look at the fowls look at the animal kingdom now look at the botany kingdom consider the lilies how they grow they tell not they spit not yet i said to them that solomon and all his glory was not a raid like one of these if god so clothed the grass which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast in the oven how much more will god clothe you oh i want to look like a beautiful star forget it let god clothe you amen spiritually and naturally praise the lord god is removing your reliance on the tree of knowledge let me declare it to you my dear friends much is coming brother brandon preach the on coming storm amen he preached it before the seals for a purpose now he says now and seek you not what you shall eat and what you shall drink neither be ye of a doubtful mind oh is it going to happen is it not going to happen don't be of a doubtful mind see god must stabilize you is that right now watching what he says next to the elect for all these things do the nations of the world seek after but they want to rule their own life is that right and your father knows that you have need of these things but now this is the thing that's parroted by a bunch of parrots all the time seeking the kingdom of god and they don't even know what an earth is talking about you can go into a denominations say oh brother seek ye the kingdom of god man they don't have a clue what they're talking about because when he says seek ye the kingdom of god he's talking about the second fold part of the mystery of god it's part of the rapture i'll show you the quote and all these things shall be added unto you after you can take hitship from the lord you've got to give him ketchup over yourself then all these things are added unto you then he says when you see laodicea collapsing threefold he said to his flock fear not he didn't say to a flock of camels cows i a sheep whose name's in the lamb's book of life is that right and the eternal section of the book of life who had no beginning and no end you had no beginning and you have no ends why are you fearful hey why are you fearful let's kill devils now all right okay show me brother adrian where brother graham says that okay here it comes just so if you've got a doubtful heart then our headship is a kingdom amen this is what he says by seeking you the kingdom of god coming totally into submission to his will that is the kingdom is that right right let's just go a little bit further now i'm just going to flick through a few things i don't want to go and preach this whole sermon because it will take till tomorrow so we're just going to give you some mercy stage one and the fall of leia deceir it will be let's have a look now brother brown preaches his last five sermons and these are his last five sermons the rapture which is threefold things that are to be speaking about theophany modern events been made clear by prophecy leadership leadership before he goes away to be with the lord and what's communion coming to a union with god is that right eat my flesh drink my blood come into a spiritual union with me praise the lord now we're going to go and show this rich young ruler in different places of the bible to get the connectivity all right it's a connecting time now let's have a look now here he is the rich and ron was speaking to the seventh seal himself and behold one came under and saying good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life he said why call of selmy good there is none but good but one that is god but if you will enter into life keep the commandments now he's talking to the united states of america he's speaking to the last church and he's speaking to the whole world have you observed what happened to the united states of america when they turned down the day of their visitation what a garbage nation that is now it is the laughing stock it is in debt up to its ears and it can never pay back and rome is controlling it because who controls the debt controls the nation and here's a bag ahab being told by jezebel invade there invade there put boycotts there put sanctions there and the stupid ahab who's in debt has to do what that mongrel woman said is that right what about the world because this message went to every nation and they turned down the day of the visitation what happens to the world now watch what happens says here he said what jesus says thou shalt not murder this is not committed that you should not steal you should not be a fault witness witness are not thy father and mother and you shall love the neighbor as thyself so here he is standing in front of the seventh seal christ himself and he's trying to remain in a past dispensation your self-will must be a past dispensation amen you cannot keep your own self-will that is a past dispensation that is a past economy amen praise the lord now watch him now in the first part of the rapture cycle i should say in the first part of his oops sinking and the young man said all these things have i kept from my youth what lack i yet now self will and possessions i'm not saying get rid of your possessions but that was the problem with the age you're with me now the problem with the age because he types revelation chapter 3 and jesus said if you be perfect go and sell and what you have and give to the poor and you shall receive treasure in heaven come and follow me but when the young man heard the saying he went away sorrowful because he had great possessions and this whole world is a world of great possessions and possessions are only a problem if it hinders a person from coming under hit headship you could have possessions but if it gets in the way of you coming under headship it becomes a major stumbling block and ladisian's pro ladies problem was that possessions became an idol now watch now so i i ain't even ever even hit anything yet there's only a foundation yeah don't worry i'm not going to keep you till 2 o'clock now watch it now which what what's the rich young world because you say i'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know it's not that you are wretched and miserable and poor and naked so now this man was facing a gateway the bible says in um 2 peter chapter 1 an entrance shall be preached unto you at the end time and he's standing at the entrance to another dimension and he turns down the one who stands the sheep they the shepherd and the sheep fold he turns down the seventh seer is that right and he got locked into darkness and this world is locked into darkness after light has come is that right okay now brother brown says you don't have to die now to go to heaven you don't have to die to go to hell because why heaven has come down and hell has come up is that right hell is already on the earth the only thing that's stopping people from seeing that other place as their body so now laodicea was a attitude of self reliance and the lord is saying to john come up higher john you won that ate the book cut up higher i want you to come into a higher realm while you're walking on the earth just like enoch was he was not god took him enoch was he got commented into a rapture cycle he was not but he's still walking around on the earth and you if you've been born again i was not you are historically non-existent god does not marry a girl with a history he takes all your history and puts it under the blood and it's gone you're his you're historically non-existent praise the lord are you with me now stage two oh it's gonna get hot man you watch this stage two economic expansionism and the time of the door of the gentile shuts economic expansionism this too this is to this world now and don't be fooled economic expansionism is a sign to you it's over but if you don't see it by the scriptures you'll keep walking on thinking oh well in five years i'm going to have this in 10 years and you've got your own economic plan all laid out the ground of the certain rich young man brought forth plentifully after the son of man ministries turned down and he thought within himself what shall i do because the hell i have no room to bestow my fruits he said i will pull down my bars i've got an economic plan bros i'm going to go now next year we're going to build a building over here and we're going to get a loan for this and and we're just going to expand in the commerce we're going to expand everything in a time when it's collapsing and it doesn't look like it's collapsing but it is it's toastman he says little bride observe what's going on it's collapsing and it don't look like it's collapsing but it is praise the lord he says i will pull down my barns and so i forgot this plan man i'm gonna pull down my blinds i'm going to expand my business i'm going to do this i'm going to do that it's all right if god's leading you to do these things okay let's let's get everything to a balance if god is in control in your life you just carry on but i'm talking about looking at the world see and build greater and i'll bestow all my fruits and my goods watch this man what's the system what shall i do after the rejection of the son of man what can i do with my gift and let me say to people out there who turn away from the lord the lord does not take away your gift your gift will still be there in hell amen do you realize this is going to stir the pot a bit these people who put on the internet things disputing brother branham will be still disputing it when they are in hell i hope they heard that what can i do with my gift an age has been trapped into darkness where it cannot see the cup of iniquity filling up so he says i will pull down my bonds i will build greater than satan has got a hold of the gift and taken it into human ambition a world economic expansion and he thinks these blessings are coming in us as a signers all as well not knowing it's a sign of the end is that right sobering ain't it okay well let's see that that's in the third exodus what about the first exodus banking building agriculture expanding before egypt fell and guess who it's picking up and influencing god's people therefore did they set over the task masters masters to afflict them with burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities that actually happens to be a bank a treasure city holds money for expansion cities and python ramesses and there were decrees that were coming forth to keep those people so busy with the dosh that they lost their spiritual sight is that right and the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew praise god revelation is multiplied they're right praise the lord and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigor it was a hard time while the expansionism was going on amen and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage to make them all look like they've been baptized in lemon juice always like them look at sad looks on the face all the time you know with hard bondage and mortar and brick and all manner of service in the field and all their service holding the people in fear and bondage while an exodus was moving into reality praise the lord and there they set the power of egypt the power of this world and a total delusion now watch now now the soul has moved into a blindness to the prophetic and i will say to my soul so you has much goods laid up for many years all right oh i've just made my plans good man in five years i'm going to have this in 10 years i'm going to have this oh i've made my plans for many years he says that take long eat your ease eat drink and be merry man i have achieved so much oh i'm so great not nine dooms laying at his door you're right hope you're awake hope you're spiritually awake and god said you're full yeah oh oh i wouldn't want someone to say that to me now watch now so is he that lathe up treasure for himself is not rich towards god so it set up its social security system for many years oh it had its own pension scheme all set up and its insurance systems that set up investors and investments and he's laying up treasure for the system for itself but it's doomed it's toast man now just to stimulate you a little bit the cry in his soul had become drowned out by what he perceived was blessings and economic collapse always happens during an exodus with pestilences oh my get into trouble saying things like this ah pestilences is a part of the collapse but i'm not going to say anything about it because there's some pharisees that get very upset with me so we will avoid that and you have to read between the lines you're with me now all right let's go to stage three hell has come up on the earth to industrialize hell what are you trying to tell me that hell has become industrialized yes oh is that right oh my goodness and there's a certain rich man we've just read this before now what's the attitude of this man i mean the guy is so sarcastic he has got no compassion for the poor look at what this world's turned into brethren they don't care about the low classes they don't care about those that have got no need they just kick them around and watch the inflation watching everything going up and the amount of food that you can buy is getting less and less and less and less and it's engineered that way now call me a fanatic if you want it's engineered that way if you understand the seven seals you will know that under the fourth seal was what was famines pestilences and death yes that's right i hope you're watching modern events becoming clear by vindicated prophecy so you should not be surprised when you see these things happening upon the earth praise god i don't have any desire for popularity because i'm sure ain't with some people and watch now and design and this what's watching what's a lazarus designed to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table more of the dogs came and licked the sauce see we don't care for you people mate you're just nothing lazarus was he lit can you understand me he's an elect seed of god in the bosom of abraham and there's a power who don't care one bit about you and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angel into abraham's bosom and the rich young rich man also died and was buried and he lifted up and inhaled they lifted up his eyes and began in torments and seeing abraham are far off in lazarus in this bosom now this man when he was on the earth he was giving out orders because he had servants now he's in hell and he's doing the same thing the spirit you die and does not change is that right it just all that changes is a dwelling place but the gift is still there it never goes away i hope some ministers hear this the gift never goes away and he said father abraham have mercy on me and sinful lazarus then he may dip the tip of his finger in the water and call my tongue for i am tormented in this flame now look at the world today it's full of torment brother branham says i see insanity coming up on the earth brother brennan was the angel with the seventh veil insanity i can tell you you do not have to wait for it to come it has arrived praise the lord and insanity comes by losing their minds but i want to tell you you have gained your mind you have the mind of jesus christ the woman does not have a mind of her own she takes her husband's mind praise the lord now what have happened to him hell has become an industrial complex fear medical engineered diseases hybriding dna knowledge now if you're in the i.t industry you can rest easy we still have to drive a car the car did not come from the perfect will of the lord you understand me the arms industry entertainment and where is this world today it's in a place mercy is fading out he rejected mercy so you see the first play you have to have a trial the trial is a great right from the judgment but now he's in a place called the prison house this world is in a prison house and the leaders of the nations do as they are told now we're going to go to this next part again while you see this take no thought now you got to be challenged on this my friends majorly challenged on this are you going to rule your own life are you going to let god do it it's going to cause a massive trumpet to be sounding in your spiritual life there are influences going on around the world that is so colossal to make you get caught up in the move of it now i'm just going to put down my computer from i'm just going to show you some stuff turn with me to revelations chapter 12. we're going to look at these things about what is happening now in the second folder of the rapture i'm just going to have to improvise this because i don't have any notes on it i want you to watch these things this is the second fold of the rapture just before the bride goes away and to eternity there is a power on the earth causing you to get carried away with that power oh my goodness revelations 12 the last maybe a few whereas verses this and the woman who's that the bright verse 14. we're given two wings of a great eagle a moses and an elijah anointing is that right what did moses stand for what did elijah stand for elijah restored the evening sacrifice moses brought in an exodus and brother branham had two anointings in his life is that right and we've been carried on an anointing of two wings watch now of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into a place where she's nourished for time times and half the time from the face of the serpent what's that that's a body change now she's an eternity but in eternity there's no time all right there's no time in eternity but on the earth there's time so the only way that he could express it was by tate john must take an earthly perspective because there's no time and eternity he has to use an earthly perspective to express something and the serpent he did not say the devil he did not say satan he did not say lucifer now when he says that this is the thing you must get specific with words he said the serpent because he's talking about the is talking about the personifying of something remember in the in genesis chapter 3 it was the personifying of an anointing of satan is that right now watch he says and the and the serpent cast out of his mouth what comes out of the mouth words how is it coming out of his mouth using waters like a flood what is waters human beings water information coming out of the serpent's mouth using people using the news media care to try to carry you away in a flood of words a flood a flood is something that carries with great force and it's coming against you is it speaking to you this is serious time you must identify things by the scriptures not by some garbage can in the news media didn't say i was pc i just say it the way that it is there's a bunch of garbage cans to carry you away in the flood but praise god i heard another voice [Applause] i had another voice from heaven i didn't hear a voice from hell i heard another voice from heaven say john come up higher come out of the influences of the sin of the earth [Applause] praise the lord you want another one that was a that was the second part of the rapture now just before a body change is that a part of the rapture okay let's turn to luke chapter two do you know that mary types the end time bright is that right did you have a visitation from gabriel is that right did you have a visitation from gabriel yes but the bribe says gabriel come at the first coming gabriel comes at the second coming the lord comes down the mighty angel descends from heaven here comes gabriel to juan and he every time gabriel comes he says to my beloveds i mean gabriel comes he breaks the seals over your life and then he brings you into a spiritual war amen the devil said shut that guy up are you finished with the devil yeah i'll tell you something okay look at the two first one okay let's give them another good hiding hey and it came to pass in those days they went a decree my goodness me the politicians again a decree writings coming out of the power who didn't come from caesar augustus who caesar augustus he's a roman is that right and it's at a specific time because mary has met the angel under the shout out you got it now [Music] she heard the shout out now she's going into the second part of the rapture cycle and there's decrees coming out under the second part of the rapture cycle to break her watch what happens now i love this and there was a taxing and this was taxing i should say that all the world should be taxed all the world now the word taxi means a census a collecting of information is that right there's an information age and the collecting all the information about you can you see modern events being made clear by vindicated prophecy they're collecting information biometrics all these things about you all for good reasons of course they're right all for good reasons they listen to those bunch of lies you know brother baby's politicians are of the devil oh but they look so nice so beautiful lovely bunch of snakes and this noise now and all went to be taxed everyone to his own city who was orchestrating this or above a door god was because he had to get joseph and mary back to a geographical location for a birth to come forth you're always blaming the devil but god's over the devil remember brother man says that there was just a two in the hands of god as a contrast and when the devil has been has been finished with he's toast praise the lord so i like to see people who can connect with scriptures there's not a time for a bunch of theories in the message is that right right now what's now and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth unto judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house of the lineage of david and god was maneuvering them back to their place of origin in a time of a squeeze is that right oh don't you just love it i tell you all right i'm i'm i'm just going to cut this whole meeting just short i'm going to give you just one more thing this message is full of the second part of the rapture i have to improvise this now okay i got no notes do you believe that joshua types the book of ephesians is ephesians the end time book in the dispensation of the film this time he'll gather all things unto christ all in the heavens and all in the earth and ephesians chapter 12 says there will be a shaking of the heavens and the shaking of the earth to shake down which can be shaken is that right and remember in the second part of the rapture cycle ruth is on the threshing floor she's already met the chief reaper brother branham now she's coming to a new birth in chapter three and she's gone to the threshing floor of boaz and now she's on the threshing floor because the wheat must be separated from the chaff on the threshing floor and you have a chaff nature so god on the threshing floor starts putting us through things and the second part of the rapture getting your chaffey nature's removed praise the lord because she came as a moabite then she was no longer a stranger she was a citizen of the kingdom then after she went to the threshing floor she went into boeser's house a body chain from the pistols to our father's house [Applause] now judah romney is the book before joshua is that right and moses is preparing the people to go into the land and the jordan river was the seals being revealed is that right moses had to go off the scene joshua had to come in joshua was there to place the people the holy ghost to come to place you is that right but when moses before moses went he said when you go into the land make six cities of refuge there's a mystery in the six cities six cities was a shadow six means the ways of man they're right and those six cities were there if there was judgment in the land upon you if you had committed a crime you had to rush to one of those six cities and go in there and go through the door into one of those six cities and then in that place you had safety away from the judgment i want to tell you the mystery of the six cities the six cities was in a shadow of the seventh seal because he's our seven city and in that sieve of seven city has his calm and be a prisoner to me in my seventh city don't you've got to be happy to stay in the seventh city because if you go outside of the city of refuge there's judgment and where did you preach that letting off the pressure so i'm not going to rely on myself i want to be connected to my tree of life amen have you come into the seventh city of refuge my dear friends musicians come forth please you come up here i'd like to go into the deeper things on this but i'm just hitting the highlights now fear must vanish don't you go listen to the the decrees of those bunch of serpents seed out there god's word establishes everything i don't care what they say or what they do when i was you know when i was doing missionary work people couldn't understand why i never got knocked off i spent 15 or 16 years in missionary work and i could have been killed a number of times i think so you never want to be you never want to go into mystery work it's deadly man and and all this time the lord was with me he was guarding me you know i can be a bit of a i can be a little bit too humorous sometimes but you know and sometimes human gets me into trouble just a bit but i would go into a place and there's these hoods who wanted to go and mug me after i've been serving gods and they see this see this this stranger in this village where a guy like me should not be and i'm going to get some a coke because it was a hard meeting you know and i was just dry my eyes dry as a no we might say i was drying there i had to go and get a coke so i had the winter space to get a coke and two hoods see me going into this place and god protects you the bible says the angels of the lord tempest their believer is that right is that so then why are you scared so these two hoods come up man they think here is a go they got within one metre of me and they turned into statues they couldn't move they were standing there they couldn't touch me and being a natural comedian i got my money out to pay the man for the coke and i stuck it right in front of his nostrils like that like this and i gave it to them sometimes i just get a bit carried away but i knew that they were paralyzed so i decided to have some fun and i tell you something brothers and sisters the angel of the lord was there guarding me in spite of my peculiarities he guards you you don't have to be some special kind of a human being brother branham says be the way god made you is that right if god's made you if god made you a little bit of a comedian stay like that as long as it's converted [Applause] you get me on the testimonies man you're getting into some heavy stuff i went to a place one day i said don't go out there wait man don't go out there dangerous dangerous being me i want to have a look i'd go out come back i said to this guard at this place so what's going on about man he said i've just been out there and that's real and you say it's dangerous i come back in so into this compound with all barbed wire around and stuff so i go out again i think i've told some people this particular at this particular testimony if i go out again nothing happens to me i go out of the compound again all the walking around the place nothing happens to me come back in i decide i want to go for another walk so i go so the guard lets me out i walk around and there's this a little native man sitting on a chair he says i want to guide you man i want you i want to go with you it says look man why is it that you fellas are always going on it's so dangerous out there i said he says nothing's happening to me he says well it's because you have no fear amen and there were 30 to 40 drug dealers in a circle you know what traffic druggies are like they used to be in a bit of experience and you're handing out stuff around the place and i'm just walking around as i'm just a farmer you know not too not too sophisticated just walking around and there's something to see all these druggies and i'm heading straight towards them and a peculiar look comes over their face and they they look they're looking like this and i was walking straight towards them not knowing what they were doing and they parted like the red sea and they're looking what's going on here there's an anointing there see and then they were looking it was it was like they were startled and then after i walked through the midst of him the red sea came back in again praise the lord see when you know your calling do you know your calling brothers and sisters it's time to rest in your identification brother andy here and i've we've gone around vietnam and that and we've been chased by the cops i've been chased by the cops so often it's almost becoming a humorous because the cops can't catch me they have never caught me they come close there one time dinner brother andy but but being good at changing the scenery that they um didn't have any luck but you see i want to just say this to you be stable god is the one who knows the obstacles and squander your job in front of your debt in front of this he is the one who's orchestrated it to be like this so there's only one thing you can do look up is that right let's send our feet i'm gonna pray for you all you lay your hands on somebody that's next door to you this is the time brothers and sisters where divine love must have preeminences in your life amen this bow hits precious heavenly

come on the scene and cast that spirit of fear off that there be such a liberty no longer concerned about what's the next person thinking what's the next person doing it's all an independent thing
