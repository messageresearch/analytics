[40:44] um
[40:44] verbatim
[40:49] and
[40:52] so the Bible says here
[40:54] blessed are the meek
[40:56] for they shall inherit the earth
[40:58] now it's not the size of the text it's
[41:00] what's in the text that counts amen the
[41:02] word is eternal so amen so we're just
[41:04] going to read that one scripture there
[41:06] so let's just bow heads in the word of

[42:07] Lord if their second body raise them up
[42:10] o god father meet their needs too Lord
[42:12] we love you and we thank you in Jesus
[42:14] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[42:16] friends you may have your seats this
[42:18] morning so I want to talk about meekness
[42:21] and meekness is not a weakness you know
[42:23] some people think you know there is a an
[42:26] element of human meekness which is a
[42:28] weakness because people just get pushed
[42:30] around but we know that true meekness is
[42:32] not is not a negative trait but as the
[42:35] Lord said here blessed are the meek for
[42:36] they shall inherit the earth so in other
[42:38] words they will go on the Rapture
[42:39] they'll be in the Millennium then
[42:41] they'll go to the new hymns in the earth
[42:43] so we'll adhere it all think so you know
[42:45] just when you read the Beatitudes
[42:46] speaking of the character of a Believer
[42:48] amen so so meekness is a powerful a very
[42:52] powerful attribute to possess now um so
[42:55] that they a Bible dictionary says it's a
[42:57] mildness of disposition a gentleness of
[43:00] spirit it's a meekness so it's not
[43:02] someone that flies off the handle all
[43:04] the time you know someone maybe uh you
[43:06] know driving slow in front of you and
[43:08] just fly off the handle with road rage
[43:09] and that kind of thing that's not
[43:11] meekness that's just road rage but just
[43:12] hey let them drive you know we all want
[43:14] to get somewhere don't we and you want
[43:16] that person to get somewhere too so you
[43:18] know so you know so we shouldn't be too
[43:20] too crazy at this position you know
[43:22] see-sawing from nothing to extremes and
[43:25] you know shouting and jumping and angry
[43:28] and then nothing and then yeah we don't
[43:30] want to be like that we don't want to be
[43:31] like the weather we want to be the same
[43:33] yeah in every situation
[43:36] amen then then a good old Mr Wikipedia
[43:38] said meekness is an attribute of human
[43:40] nature and behavior that has been
[43:42] defined as a elegant and I had to see
[43:45] what that word is it's a mixture of of
[43:47] righteousness and a humility and
[43:49] patience meekness has been contrasted
[43:52] with humility alone and so much as
[43:53] humility simply refers to an attitude
[43:56] towards oneself a restraining of One's
[43:59] Own power so as to allow room for others
[44:02] now we know true humility is letting
[44:04] God's word rule your life amen so that's
[44:06] the allowing room for others whether
[44:08] there's only one other which is God so
[44:10] you let the word of God rule your life
[44:11] that's true humility whereas meekness
[44:13] refers to the treatment of others amen
[44:16] so we want to have a Meek disposition
[44:18] towards one another and not just one
[44:19] another but to anyone we come across in
[44:22] life amen they you know I trusted our
[44:24] that our testimony is that we are a
[44:27] humble Meek people
[44:29] amen which is not a put on it's not a
[44:32] manufactured meekness but it's a but
[44:34] it's a holy ghost meekness I mean where
[44:36] God comes and lives in a person's life
[44:38] now these things are very important
[44:40] because we're living in an hour where
[44:41] the third pool will be manifested the
[44:43] power of the spoken word that is Among
[44:45] Us will will will will take full control
[44:47] amen where it's more than just a you
[44:50] know it's where God because remember
[44:51] everything that was manifested in Jesus
[44:54] Christ power over nature power over the
[44:56] devil power over death all those things
[44:58] amen because he was the he was the
[45:01] second Adam right so he says he
[45:03] displayed everything that the first Adam
[45:04] lost Dominion right but now he'll take a
[45:07] church the second Eve and place her into
[45:09] that position as well but you see the
[45:11] power of the spoken word is not just
[45:13] saying now what do I feel like today let
[45:14] there be McDonald's or let there be a
[45:16] new house or let there be a new car
[45:18] that's not the power of the spoken word
[45:19] the power spoken word is when you're
[45:21] surrendered to God and God speaks
[45:23] through you pray through you that is
[45:25] through you what he wants to do remember
[45:27] when you receive the Holy Ghost it's not
[45:28] you can try calling the Holy Ghost it's
[45:31] the Holy Ghost controlling you amen as
[45:33] the Apostle Paul would say Paul the
[45:36] prisoner of Jesus Christ and he was a
[45:38] prison not because he was in a prison
[45:40] but because he was a prisoner to the
[45:42] will of God remember he wanted to go to
[45:44] a certain place but they said the spirit
[45:46] forbade him to go so even even the Holy
[45:48] Ghost he was so surrendered that he
[45:50] didn't even do his own will amen so
[45:53] that's how we want to be amen because
[45:55] now we understand there's a lot of
[45:57] Supernatural in this day not just in
[46:00] Christian Realms but but in different
[46:01] religions is Supernatural but there's
[46:03] things that the devil cannot impersonate
[46:06] and there comes a point like we're just
[46:08] going to speak here here about Moses
[46:11] Moses calling the children of Israel out
[46:13] of Egypt now we know that there were two
[46:16] you know the other court magicians of
[46:17] pharaoh and they did they did
[46:19] Supernatural things and and Paul would
[46:21] write to Timothy about it saying as
[46:23] Janice and jambres were stood Moses so
[46:25] these would resist the truth right but
[46:27] there came a point where The Magicians
[46:29] could not do what Moses could do amen
[46:32] they could throw this um um staffs down
[46:34] turned into snakes while Moses snake
[46:37] swallowed their snakes up and then it
[46:38] turned back into a staff where did their
[46:40] staffs go into his staff right so
[46:42] there's different things they could do
[46:43] but there came a point where they could
[46:45] not impersonate they could not copy what
[46:48] Moses did and so it says here now and
[46:50] The Magicians did so with the
[46:52] enchantments to bring forth life but
[46:53] they could not so there was lies upon
[46:55] man and upon beasts in the magician said
[46:58] unto Pharaoh this is the Finger of God
[46:59] so they realize this is greater than we
[47:02] can even do so there comes a point
[47:04] whether where Satan cannot impersonate
[47:07] a certain thing
[47:09] and and and and that thing that he
[47:11] cannot impersonate is he cannot
[47:13] impersonate the word of God where he can
[47:15] impersonate any gift you know people are
[47:18] you know people who speak in tongues
[47:19] it's not necessarily the Holy Ghost it
[47:21] can be a demon power speaking but we
[47:23] believe in speaking in tongues we
[47:25] believe in Prophecy and different things
[47:26] but what Spirits motivated we believe in
[47:28] dancing but what spirit's motivating the
[47:30] dance you know we believe in the the
[47:33] full manifestations of all the holy
[47:35] spirit because it's in the word but it's
[47:36] got to be the Holy Ghost doing it see
[47:38] amen so so the devil can impersonate
[47:40] anything
[47:42] but he cannot impersonate the third pull
[47:44] I mean he cannot impersonate the word
[47:46] right he cannot impersonate that word
[47:49] because if he could then he'd be a
[47:51] believer if he really believed the word
[47:52] and took God at his word so that's why
[47:54] we've got to stay with the word man
[47:56] shall not live by bread Lumber
[47:57] everywhere that proceeds out of the
[47:59] mouth of God the word must be the Bible
[48:01] must be our absolute it must be our
[48:03] typos it must be our everything not our
[48:05] opinion not culture not ideas but it
[48:08] must be the word of God Amen so Satan
[48:11] can but you see it's not just the ink on
[48:13] paper that he can't impersonate it's
[48:15] actually talk about the character of the
[48:17] word coming into a people the word
[48:19] putting on flesh in a people that's why
[48:21] Jesus died amen that he would wash our
[48:23] sins away but then his his Spirit his
[48:25] life would come into you and I and he'd
[48:27] be the Christian in you and I because
[48:29] that's the only way we can be
[48:30] christ-like if it's Christ himself is in
[48:32] you and I otherwise we're just being a
[48:34] copy or a mimic we're not here to be
[48:36] mimics we're here to be genuine
[48:37] Christians amen so he can impersonate
[48:40] anything but he can't but not that word
[48:43] so he can impersonate any gift he can do
[48:45] all those things but you know shouting
[48:47] speaking in tongues different things but
[48:49] it can still be wrong
[48:52] amen and so the thing he cannot so just
[48:55] like those magicians there in in Egypt
[48:58] they they came to a point they couldn't
[49:00] impersonate what Moses was doing and now
[49:02] it'll come down to a point now that they
[49:04] will not be able to uh impersonate the
[49:07] third pull now the third pull is the
[49:09] power of the spoken word which is just
[49:11] the greater of what we already have I
[49:13] mean so for example there's the five
[49:15] instances of the uh manifestation of the
[49:18] third pool and brother Brown's Ministry
[49:19] we know one was he spoke a tumor out of
[49:21] his wife's side that was the size of a
[49:23] grapefruit she's on the other end of the
[49:24] country in America and the Holy Ghost
[49:26] came down and says speak and it shall be
[49:28] and and he just prayed Lord when she's
[49:30] on the operating table before the
[49:32] surgeon ever cuts her aside now she had
[49:34] a tumor the size of a grapefruit in her
[49:35] inner side
[49:37] when the surgeon goes to cut her may
[49:39] just disappear and the surgeon went to
[49:41] cut and the and the whole thing
[49:43] disappeared and he had to look at X-rays
[49:44] and see it says there's no tumor here
[49:45] anymore so that is just a greater
[49:48] magnitude of laying on of hands
[49:50] anointing with oil see it's just a
[49:52] greater of what's already here right the
[49:55] same with speaking the fish you know
[49:57] life you know different things he did
[49:59] right and now we know that the third
[50:01] pull has been manifested in our midst
[50:03] right we know it's it's it's here right
[50:06] we've seen it manifested amen so but the
[50:10] devil can't impersonate it
[50:12] people will try and impersonate it but
[50:14] it takes the character of Christ in a
[50:16] person because he can't impersonate real
[50:18] Christianity but he tries we know that
[50:22] amen see but you see now and now we're
[50:25] living in a time we'll be where it will
[50:27] be manifested in the fullness of its
[50:28] power so it's very important we keep
[50:31] these things in mind because we gotta we
[50:33] need to have the character of Christ
[50:35] right shall we become newborn babes in
[50:38] the Lord we get birth in the Kingdom by
[50:39] the Holy Ghost we've got to mature and
[50:40] grow that God can have his full Reign
[50:43] who wants goddamn full reign in their
[50:44] life who wants God to take control but
[50:47] it's no longer I that liveth but Christ
[50:48] that liveth in me amen because but the
[50:51] thing is we know that character because
[50:53] remember we we need to have the
[50:55] character of Christ
[50:57] we know character is a victory it's not
[50:59] a gift it's not just given to you now
[51:01] you have the character of Christ it's a
[51:03] victory and that Victory is actually
[51:05] over your own self
[51:07] remember the devil was defeated that
[51:08] down Calvary he's still defeated today
[51:10] he's still a loser today as he was then
[51:12] he's conquered so what now has to be
[51:15] conquered our own human will our own
[51:18] human ability our own human what we want
[51:20] remember Jesus greatest remember Calvary
[51:23] the resurrection was one when the Lord
[51:25] Jesus was in Gethsemane he said not my
[51:27] will but thy will be done see and that
[51:30] and so so because to me the greatest
[51:32] Miracle of the Lord Jesus ever did it
[51:34] wasn't feeding the multitudes it wasn't
[51:36] raising Lazarus wasn't doing all the
[51:38] incredible it was he subjected his own
[51:40] body
[51:41] to the word of God that he had to
[51:43] fulfill remember he was he was fully God
[51:45] but he was fully man right he was the
[51:47] god man but he had to subject these
[51:50] human elements to the word of God and he
[51:53] knew what he had to fulfill right he
[51:55] knew because Moses and Elijah told them
[51:57] about Transfiguration the things he had
[51:59] to accomplish in Jerusalem and remember
[52:01] he said the son could do nothing but
[52:03] what the father shows them and what the
[52:05] and what the father does the son does
[52:06] likewise that means he was led by a
[52:08] vision so he saw Calvary everything by
[52:11] vision and he knew what he was going to
[52:13] suffer
[52:14] but yet he subjected himself to that and
[52:16] it was all prophecy being fulfilled amen
[52:19] so if we want if we want the character
[52:20] of Christ which is fit to rule amen we
[52:24] must have we must be surrendered to the
[52:26] word of God because remember power
[52:28] without character is satanic
[52:32] now I've been speaking the last few
[52:34] services on humility and and and and not
[52:37] being selfish and so on and and I've
[52:39] taken Ezekiel 28 but the other parts
[52:42] after this here but it's amazing here
[52:44] where where the Lord is speaking to the
[52:46] prince of Tyrus there and he's not just
[52:49] speaking to the man but the anointing on
[52:51] the man
[52:53] but look at this it's amazing how how um
[52:56] in verse 3 here it says behold Thou Art
[52:59] wiser than Daniel
[53:01] and there is no secret that they can
[53:04] hide from thee so here's a man you look
[53:07] at Daniel
[53:08] Daniel had such wisdom
[53:11] he saw from the beginning to the end he
[53:13] saw the same things John saw in the Book
[53:15] of Revelation he saw incredible things
[53:17] he's a very wise man he was such a wise
[53:20] man he was he was under the king in
[53:22] Babylon and then when the medes and
[53:23] Persians came and they hired him to run
[53:25] the place too he was a very wise man but
[53:28] you see this Prince of Tyrus was even
[53:30] wiser than Daniel
[53:32] but then what did he do with the wisdom
[53:35] he collected riches he got gold and
[53:37] silver and all these things so he just
[53:39] increased his own kingdom with the
[53:41] wisdom that God gave him he didn't use
[53:43] it for God's benefit he didn't use it
[53:45] for other people's benefit he used it
[53:46] for his own benefit
[53:48] so he didn't have the character to rule
[53:50] he didn't have the character to use that
[53:52] wisdom and so people can be very gifted
[53:54] people they can preach they can sing
[53:57] they can do incredible things but do
[53:59] they have the character to go with the
[54:00] gift that God gave them because remember
[54:02] a gift the gift and calling gifts and
[54:04] calling a guider without repentance so
[54:06] someone has a gift before they
[54:08] repentance has got nothing to do with it
[54:10] that's why there's great gifts in the
[54:12] earth and they're not Christians they're
[54:13] atheists or whatever more very gifted
[54:15] people very wealthy people very famous
[54:18] people very gifted people but what have
[54:20] they done with that gift
[54:21] see so we're going to be we're gonna say
[54:23] Lord take my life whatever you've made
[54:25] me to be Lord may may you just come and
[54:27] live out of my life
[54:30] amen so yeah this man was wiser than
[54:32] Daniel but yet he used it for his own
[54:33] ability and we we must be very careful
[54:35] we never get into that position
[54:38] but we think the Lord use us the way he
[54:41] wants us to be
[54:42] now
[54:45] brother bran would speak in a
[54:47] um in in one place and he's speaking
[54:49] about after the seals have come open
[54:50] he's had a lot of rejection you know
[54:52] from people and different things
[54:55] and and he's saying there's got to be a
[54:57] change and he's speaking to some extra
[54:59] young people he says there's got to be a
[55:00] change in me that I get a feeling back
[55:02] for the people again
[55:04] and so whatever everything that God has
[55:07] there's got to be a change of us to
[55:09] match the word
[55:10] right
[55:11] and that's not just Doctrine that's
[55:14] attitudes that's that's our temperament
[55:17] our character right anything that's not
[55:19] of God that's got to be taken away that
[55:22] God can live see we're all built
[55:24] differently God is not a cookie cutter
[55:26] amen but the thing is there's parts of
[55:28] our nature that got to be taken away
[55:29] family strain's got to be taken away you
[55:32] see family strains of stubbornness or
[55:34] indifference or anger or whatever it is
[55:36] those things are going to be taken out
[55:37] but you're going to let God take it out
[55:39] because sometimes we can say well I'm
[55:41] just born this way this is how I am no
[55:43] maybe in your mind but in God's mind he
[55:46] says no I I want you to match my word
[55:48] but the only way you can match my word
[55:50] is if you yield to me that I can mold
[55:52] you remember he's the Potter and we are
[55:54] the clay it's not the other way around
[55:57] but it's good to feel his hands isn't it
[55:59] molding and shaping and changing and
[56:02] sure it may feel a bit uncomfortable
[56:03] when he pulls the handle around he picks
[56:05] the picks you up and molds you this way
[56:07] oh my you feel the hands of Jehovah in
[56:09] your life but it's good because he's got
[56:11] he's got an image in mind amen that
[56:14] image is you being made in the image of
[56:15] his word amen so he says God will never
[56:18] change the ministry but he'll change the
[56:20] man with the ministry that's what's to
[56:22] be done amen so he's got to change us to
[56:25] match the ministry in the end time amen
[56:28] which is the ministry of the Lord Jesus
[56:30] Christ Living living in people
[56:33] because we know when God comes and he
[56:35] does a great change in our lives he's
[56:37] had that experience I mean God's done a
[56:39] great change the person you were you're
[56:42] not that guy no more he's dead you're
[56:44] this this new guy because remember when
[56:46] you meet the Lord really now it's a
[56:48] journey of Discovery who am I Lord what
[56:51] have you made me to be you know and and
[56:53] that's why you walk with God here begins
[56:55] to show you who you are and what he's
[56:57] made you to be and the power of His
[56:59] grace Amen to me his grace just gets
[57:01] greater the more you walk with him the
[57:03] more you appreciate him the more you
[57:05] love him amen
[57:06] Hallelujah Cece
[57:09] we're gonna
[57:10] um look at ourselves and say you know
[57:12] well I believe I've got the Holy Ghost
[57:13] and you see it don't bear and you see it
[57:16] don't bear the fruit of meekness and
[57:18] yield it and kindness and gentleness and
[57:21] forgiveness and so forth then it's time
[57:22] for you to shake out of yourself
[57:25] so you gotta look and say now what's
[57:26] what's producing in my life am I still
[57:29] grumpy at nothing
[57:32] am I still angry
[57:33] have I still got all these triggers in
[57:35] my life that you know people talk about
[57:37] triggers you've got these emotional
[57:39] triggers and your different triggers but
[57:42] but those things should not be triggers
[57:44] that's true you should be triggered and
[57:47] if there's a trigger you say Lord take
[57:48] it out of me even something is
[57:50] completely unrelated with something just
[57:52] tricky just explode or something you go
[57:54] into a shell or something and say Lord
[57:56] take those things out of me amen you
[57:59] know
[58:00] amen Our God's living who's happy today
[58:02] praise the Lord amen do a work remember
[58:05] I preached to me too you know that
[58:06] actually I preach to me and you guys
[58:08] just happen to turn up
[58:10] you know because I want to be made in
[58:12] the image of the Lord I want to bear his
[58:13] likeness amen if he said I'll make you
[58:16] like me
[58:18] you think about him
[58:20] never a man like him there never can be
[58:23] a man like him his character now he was
[58:26] the meekest man
[58:28] but he wasn't a pushover and and we're
[58:30] going to get into that he wasn't
[58:31] something just got like like a plastic
[58:33] but I guess we don't have them anymore
[58:35] these days but you see a plastic bag
[58:36] blowing in the wind that's not meekness
[58:39] that's not real Bible meekness that's
[58:41] just being a plastic bag blown or not we
[58:43] don't want to be like that
[58:47] amen so we gotta see
[58:50] it's the life that lives afterwards
[58:54] after experience that's the main thing
[58:57] amen we can shout we can jump we can
[58:59] speak in tongues we believe in all those
[59:01] things but what happens afterwards what
[59:03] life is produced afterwards see this is
[59:06] this is the main thing you see those who
[59:08] are filled with the Holy Ghost heard the
[59:10] word received it and lived by it
[59:12] amen they could become one with the word
[59:14] and it lived out of them
[59:15] I mean that's the main thing see but you
[59:18] see we're going to have an attitude of
[59:19] meekness even with receiving the word he
[59:22] says here now wherefore my beloved
[59:24] Brethren let every man be swift to hear
[59:26] slow to speak slow to wrath for the
[59:29] wrath of man worketh not the
[59:30] righteousness of God some people say I
[59:33] just got my holy indignation fired up or
[59:36] whatever you've got to be careful
[59:38] are you sure
[59:39] you know
[59:42] we'll leave that there
[59:43] well you got to be really careful
[59:45] wherefore lab puddle filthiness and
[59:48] souffluidity of naughtiness and receive
[59:50] with meekness the engrafted word which
[59:53] is able to save your souls remember so
[59:55] meekness pardon me we heard was now it's
[59:58] it's your relation to others so true
[1:00:01] meeknesses now what is your relation to
[1:00:03] the word of God now to me it does time
[1:00:05] with humility quite a lot but what is
[1:00:07] your attitude towards the word Lord
[1:00:09] don't fill my head with a bunch of
[1:00:11] knowledge change my heart to match your
[1:00:13] word remember because this is a this is
[1:00:15] a love letter
[1:00:17] right it's not it's not laws and history
[1:00:20] and prophecy only no it's a love letter
[1:00:24] yeah and the old testament's a love
[1:00:25] letter too but you've got to receive the
[1:00:28] spirit of the author then you'll see it
[1:00:29] as a love leader and you know all those
[1:00:32] who are married or maybe you know going
[1:00:34] out with someone or you know courting
[1:00:36] whatever you know as you walk with the
[1:00:39] person you fall in love with them and
[1:00:41] the more you fall in love of them the
[1:00:43] more you want to be with them and the
[1:00:45] more you want to match together like
[1:00:46] this
[1:00:47] right and it's the same thing especially
[1:00:49] with us and the Lord the more we walk
[1:00:51] with him the more we love him and the
[1:00:54] more we love him the more we want to be
[1:00:55] like him
[1:00:56] Hallelujah and it's not us saying you
[1:00:58] know Jesus you've got to change to match
[1:01:01] my lifestyle there's no Lord change me
[1:01:03] to match you Hallelujah
[1:01:06] amen so eat brother bam says I've had
[1:01:08] the privilege
[1:01:10] in my Ministry to meet Great Men King's
[1:01:12] monarchs potentakes great men and I'd be
[1:01:14] trembling when I met them for the fear
[1:01:16] that I might say the wrong thing but I
[1:01:18] find out that when I come to men who are
[1:01:21] really which really are big men they are
[1:01:23] the humblest and the meekness meekest
[1:01:26] they make you feel like you're a great
[1:01:28] big somebody but it's that fellow who
[1:01:30] thinks he's a big man that you can't get
[1:01:32] along with oh he's just so big you can't
[1:01:34] touch him that's the way it goes but God
[1:01:36] the king of heaven so condescending that
[1:01:38] he will come to the lowest prostitute in
[1:01:40] the city on this cold night if she'd
[1:01:43] only asked to the bigger on the street
[1:01:44] anywhere that there is a need a
[1:01:46] sincerity towards him God will come
[1:01:49] there's no one too low that Jesus can't
[1:01:51] reach and he doesn't just reach down he
[1:01:53] gets down to their level I'm so thankful
[1:01:55] about that
[1:01:57] Hallelujah
[1:01:58] amen now we know it says about Moses
[1:02:01] Moses was the meekest man in all the
[1:02:03] Earth at that time
[1:02:04] we understand that he was raised in
[1:02:07] Pharaoh's Palace he had a he had one
[1:02:09] foot on the throne you could say he
[1:02:11] could have been the next Pharaoh now we
[1:02:13] know pharaohs in those days they were
[1:02:14] gods and flesh they just weren't Kings
[1:02:17] or pharaohs they were gods and flesh so
[1:02:19] can you imagine the Persona he had the
[1:02:22] the the the the the the
[1:02:24] um atmosphere around him as Prince Moses
[1:02:27] of you know of Egypt he wasn't a Meek
[1:02:30] little guy being pushed around he was a
[1:02:32] he was a God and flesh walking around
[1:02:34] people you know he led his troops into
[1:02:36] battle you know because the Royals he
[1:02:38] did in those days but you see when he
[1:02:40] met the Lord At The Burning Bush it took
[1:02:42] that out of him
[1:02:44] where when he met Christ he became the
[1:02:46] meekest man in all the Earth amen
[1:02:48] because that's what happens when
[1:02:49] Revelation comes into our lives it
[1:02:52] changes our character the character of
[1:02:54] Christ begins to be expressed so he was
[1:02:57] the meekest now most now the man Moses
[1:02:59] was very Meek above all the Earth which
[1:03:01] was I mean above all the men which are
[1:03:03] upon the face of the Earth so he is a
[1:03:05] very Meek man but you see when he was
[1:03:08] dealing with the Enemy he wasn't meek
[1:03:11] amen
[1:03:14] he didn't go on before pharaoh and say
[1:03:17] you know walking like this and now would
[1:03:20] you mind Mr Pharaoh sir you know this is
[1:03:23] like cruelty and it's not nice what
[1:03:26] you're doing to my people and would you
[1:03:28] consider I was just wondering hope
[1:03:29] you're having a good day no he went in
[1:03:31] there and said let my people go Amen Let
[1:03:34] My People Go pharaoh and if you don't
[1:03:36] I'm gonna plague your kingdom until you
[1:03:37] have to I'll make you let them go amen
[1:03:40] and that's why you know Pharaoh you
[1:03:41] can't see it here but but but on his
[1:03:43] crown there was there was a cobra right
[1:03:46] and that signified he was the king and
[1:03:48] that's why that's why God God turned
[1:03:50] Moses staff into the serpent is because
[1:03:53] God was actually showing two two Pharaoh
[1:03:56] actually to Satan and Pharaoh I can I
[1:03:58] can loose you and then I can bind you so
[1:04:00] I loose you I throw you on the ground
[1:04:02] you become a servant I pick you up you
[1:04:03] become a staff I can do whatever I want
[1:04:06] with you and that's what God was
[1:04:08] displaying through Moses and it wasn't
[1:04:09] just the Pharaoh it was actually to the
[1:04:11] enemy to Satan himself I can do what I
[1:04:13] want with you you have no control over
[1:04:16] me amen so he said let my people go he
[1:04:20] said no so I'll plague you no I'll
[1:04:21] plague you just keep going on and then
[1:04:24] you know the devil always tries to
[1:04:25] compromise just take your leave your
[1:04:28] young or leave your old or leave this
[1:04:30] one and Moses just said yeah and then
[1:04:32] and then pharaoh and said just just
[1:04:34] leave your animals and he said no we're
[1:04:36] not going to leave one hoof behind we're
[1:04:38] going to take our old we're going to
[1:04:40] take our young we're going to take our
[1:04:42] middle age we're going to take our
[1:04:43] teenagers we're going to take our
[1:04:45] parents we're going to take everyone
[1:04:47] with us we're going to leave this land
[1:04:48] and go to a Promised Land Hallelujah and
[1:04:51] that should be if we're Meek like God is
[1:04:53] Meek this should this should be our
[1:04:55] attitude towards Satan Satan my children
[1:04:57] are coming my family is coming my spouse
[1:05:00] is coming I don't care what's what
[1:05:03] they're stuck in they're coming out of
[1:05:04] it amen there were men in mud puts
[1:05:07] they're all kinds there and all kinds of
[1:05:08] different slavery but they all came out
[1:05:09] of that slavery Hallelujah
[1:05:12] amens that's how we should be this
[1:05:14] morning amen against the enemies he
[1:05:16] wasn't Meek with Pharaoh he didn't
[1:05:18] compromise with the Enemy you know we're
[1:05:20] not on a peacekeeping mission mission
[1:05:22] with the devil we're here to conquer
[1:05:24] this is total war
[1:05:26] this is total war war against the hordes
[1:05:29] of hell
[1:05:30] not against people now against Spirits
[1:05:33] very different thing
[1:05:35] but you see now Moses was so meek
[1:05:39] that he would stand in the gap for his
[1:05:42] people see this is what meekness can do
[1:05:43] remember it's your relation to others
[1:05:46] right so now he saw God basically said
[1:05:49] to him listen I'm just gonna I'm gonna
[1:05:51] start with you I'm sick of these guys I
[1:05:53] see you're sick of these guys I'm sick
[1:05:55] of these guys I'm going to wipe them out
[1:05:56] start with you and then he was so Meek
[1:05:59] he said Lord block mine I'd rather you
[1:06:01] just block my name out
[1:06:03] I mean if thou will forgive their sin
[1:06:04] and if not block me I pray the out of
[1:06:06] thy book which thou has written so take
[1:06:08] me out of your book of life Lord
[1:06:12] man what a prayer what a prayer you
[1:06:15] think about that basically he's saying
[1:06:16] destroy me burn me up
[1:06:19] what a prayer
[1:06:21] Hallelujah and to me that is if you're
[1:06:23] really Meek you can intercede you can
[1:06:25] throw yourself on the breach remember
[1:06:27] this was Christ in him interceding
[1:06:28] Hallelujah so if we're really a Meek
[1:06:31] people would say we won't say well they
[1:06:32] deserve it or maybe rough them up a
[1:06:35] little bit Lord you know give them no
[1:06:38] we're going to throw ourselves in the
[1:06:40] gap
[1:06:41] hallelujah it's just like when the I
[1:06:43] think with the brass serpents is the
[1:06:45] plague going through Israel you know and
[1:06:47] then and then and then and then um Moses
[1:06:50] told Aaron to take the sensor and run
[1:06:52] between the people because you're
[1:06:54] standing between the living and the dead
[1:06:55] and we're going to realize we're
[1:06:57] standing between the living and the dead
[1:06:58] this morning I mean those who are
[1:07:00] spiritually dead those are spiritually
[1:07:01] alive and we know prayer I mean a sensor
[1:07:04] speaks of prayer we can stand in the Gap
[1:07:06] Hallelujah your prayers count people
[1:07:08] amen you realize your prayers count
[1:07:11] Hallelujah but you see he's so Meek he
[1:07:13] said Lord take me out of the whole
[1:07:15] program
[1:07:16] Hallelujah
[1:07:18] amen I trust we have that same kind of
[1:07:21] spirit in US
[1:07:24] well I don't know they did this and this
[1:07:26] and this they may have all done those
[1:07:27] things and more besides
[1:07:29] but yet Lord
[1:07:32] amen forgive them Lord
[1:07:33] they don't know what they do
[1:07:38] amen the Lord Peter would say well the
[1:07:41] Lord Jesus would say through Peter that
[1:07:42] are Meek and quiet Spirit which is in
[1:07:44] the sight of God
[1:07:46] of great price
[1:07:48] now to me that's just not talking about
[1:07:49] sisters that's talking about brothers
[1:07:51] too
[1:07:52] that's a great price to have that you
[1:07:53] know someone who thinks they're
[1:07:54] everything
[1:07:55] you know that Persona of I'm the man
[1:07:58] I'm the smartest I'm the strongest I'm
[1:08:00] the toughest I'm the roughest I'm the
[1:08:02] that's not a Meek and Gentle Spirit
[1:08:05] see that's not a that kind of personas
[1:08:08] is no value with God but those who are
[1:08:12] Meek and quiet Spirit surrendered to the
[1:08:14] word of God
[1:08:15] that's great price God says that's that
[1:08:18] that's very valuable because that's the
[1:08:20] opposite of Satan's personality I was
[1:08:23] looking at what's the op I just Google
[1:08:25] because I because I ask Google things I
[1:08:27] said what's the opposite of meekness and
[1:08:30] it said Pride arrogancy
[1:08:32] we don't want to be in that bracket we
[1:08:33] want to be a Meek people who's
[1:08:36] who's with me today
[1:08:40] you see when the Lord Jesus was baptized
[1:08:42] now I know I've spoken about these
[1:08:43] things before but he when he was
[1:08:46] baptized John said Behold the Lamb of
[1:08:49] God that takes away the sin of the world
[1:08:51] and then the Holy Spirit descended upon
[1:08:54] him like a dove now we know that both of
[1:08:57] those creatures have the same nature the
[1:08:59] lamb is the meekest of all the creatures
[1:09:01] of the earth and the dove is the meekest
[1:09:03] of all the fowls of Heaven of all the
[1:09:06] birds of heaven and that's the only way
[1:09:08] those two creatures could come together
[1:09:09] or why God symbolize himself as a lamb
[1:09:12] as a dove because they have the same
[1:09:13] natures and so in order for the Holy
[1:09:16] Ghost to rest upon us you think about
[1:09:18] the Lord Jesus now he fulfilled the
[1:09:20] scripture he had to fulfill
[1:09:22] we're here to fulfill the word too yeah
[1:09:25] not in terms of forgiving Our Lives as a
[1:09:26] sacrifice like he did but God works
[1:09:28] through man right God works through a
[1:09:31] man you see the book of Acts is not the
[1:09:32] acts the apostles it's the acts of the
[1:09:34] Holy Ghost and the apostles amen but you
[1:09:36] see Peter had to become meek
[1:09:39] here was the rugged fisherman who tried
[1:09:41] to cut the guy's ear off which looked
[1:09:43] good but actually it was an an
[1:09:46] antichrist move because he's trying to
[1:09:49] stop the word of God being fulfilled but
[1:09:51] you see God had to take him through that
[1:09:53] experience up to the upper room to make
[1:09:55] him Meek Amen to now God could use them
[1:09:57] when you know when Cornelius is praying
[1:09:59] in Acts chapter 10 and then an angel
[1:10:01] appears to him saying saying you know
[1:10:04] your prayers and arms have come up
[1:10:05] before God but go get Peter he'll tell
[1:10:07] you the words of eternal life so he was
[1:10:09] part of the body now Meek gentle humble
[1:10:13] Hallelujah
[1:10:15] where God could speak through and life
[1:10:18] could be given amen and while Peter has
[1:10:20] preached them about the Lord Jesus death
[1:10:22] burial Resurrection the Holy Ghost fell
[1:10:24] upon the Gentiles there they are sealed
[1:10:26] into the kingdom amen what eternal life
[1:10:28] was imparted well I threw a Meek part of
[1:10:32] the body but can you imagine if Peter
[1:10:35] was a buzzsaw wolf
[1:10:37] that would never have the law would
[1:10:39] never have sinned for him to go do that
[1:10:41] God couldn't use them in that kind of
[1:10:43] degree and it's the same thing with you
[1:10:45] and I if we want the Lord Jesus to not
[1:10:47] just anoint but abide
[1:10:50] we're going to become Meek we've got to
[1:10:52] have his nature and the only way we can
[1:10:55] have it because remember two Natures
[1:10:56] can't live in the same house
[1:10:58] right we're going to be willing to
[1:11:00] surrender our old nature surrender our
[1:11:02] past surrender our pain surrender
[1:11:04] surrender our humanity and say Lord
[1:11:06] change my nature to be meek and to be
[1:11:09] humble and to be like your nature and
[1:11:12] then what so and then and then and then
[1:11:14] now the holy egos can descend and take
[1:11:16] over
[1:11:17] isn't that what we want
[1:11:19] I mean to just dwell in the sweetness of
[1:11:21] his presence program season a couple of
[1:11:24] times he says you know
[1:11:26] um don't you don't you feel can't you
[1:11:28] feel that sweet
[1:11:30] that sweet feeling
[1:11:31] he says that's God that Meek feeling
[1:11:34] comes over you that's the presence of
[1:11:36] God
[1:11:37] amen and I don't know what's just
[1:11:38] happened up here
[1:11:40] that's fine
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:43] we
[1:11:47] that's broken that's fine I don't need
[1:11:49] it
[1:11:51] we need to because remember this world
[1:11:54] wants to make us hard it wants to make
[1:11:56] us detached it wants to the problem with
[1:11:58] this world is there's very little
[1:11:59] empathy
[1:12:03] this afternoon but we'll just give you a
[1:12:05] preview this world has made it that we
[1:12:07] don't have any empathy anymore
[1:12:09] and so if there's no empathy there's no
[1:12:11] care and if they are perfect okay
[1:12:14] thank you appreciate that yo and and if
[1:12:18] there's no empathy then I could say the
[1:12:20] world is not Meek anymore
[1:12:22] remember this world is is so made that
[1:12:26] people we could just turn that off
[1:12:28] actually I don't I don't I don't need it
[1:12:30] um maybe we will but you know the thing
[1:12:34] is we we must have care for one another
[1:12:37] we must have care for our families we
[1:12:40] must have care for our classmates or for
[1:12:42] our work colleagues or anyone on the
[1:12:44] street we must have empathy don't ever
[1:12:47] become detached that you can't actually
[1:12:48] enter into someone's burden
[1:12:50] and feel for them if people are sad then
[1:12:53] it's good to be sad with them those we
[1:12:55] mourn with those who mourn we Rejoice
[1:12:57] with those who Rejoice amen but we
[1:12:59] should have a feeling but the thing is
[1:13:00] this world has been engineered that
[1:13:02] there's actually very little empathy I
[1:13:04] mean means hearts are not just failing
[1:13:06] for fear but there's very little care
[1:13:08] anymore people are worried about their
[1:13:10] own selves but that's not Christianity
[1:13:12] we should put others needs above our own
[1:13:14] selves amen the Lord Jesus put his life
[1:13:16] very secondarily to yours
[1:13:18] Hallelujah
[1:13:21] amen that's how we should be
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] praise the Lord
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:27] Hallelujah
[1:13:30] amen but you see now
[1:13:32] if Jesus had the wolf nature the lamb
[1:13:35] would never I mean the Holy Ghost is a
[1:13:37] dove could never come and abide on him
[1:13:39] he had to have the same kind of Nature
[1:13:41] and it's the same thing with you and I
[1:13:42] but the problem is we can get into a
[1:13:44] spot where that lamb nature leaves us in
[1:13:46] a wolf nature comes back because we're
[1:13:48] stuck in these bodies right we need
[1:13:50] these bodies to be changed but we can't
[1:13:52] walk in a wolf nature whatever triggers
[1:13:55] us for that wolf nature to come out we
[1:13:57] need to get rid of that trigger right
[1:13:59] and it's not a learned behavior to
[1:14:00] suppress things remember we're not in
[1:14:02] this impression idea we're in a
[1:14:05] Liberation and a restoration and a you
[1:14:08] know transformation this is a
[1:14:09] Transformation Center that we don't have
[1:14:11] to just suppress character traits that
[1:14:13] are bad and try and put them in the
[1:14:14] cupboard somewhere sweep them under the
[1:14:16] rug no we don't do that kind of a thing
[1:14:18] we let God we put it on the Altar and
[1:14:20] God Burns it out I mean God changes us
[1:14:23] Hallelujah
[1:14:25] praise the Lord so I'm just going to try
[1:14:27] and find this on here amen actually
[1:14:31] I can drive on here can that go back up
[1:14:33] actually I don't I feel I do need this
[1:14:35] sorry because there's some things I I
[1:14:37] would like to
[1:14:39] bring out of here but you see Moses
[1:14:43] Moses was was Meek concerning the people
[1:14:46] but you see he had a temper problem who
[1:14:49] knows that he had a temper problem under
[1:14:51] the blood of bulls and goats he could
[1:14:53] never get rid of that temper problem
[1:14:54] because the life of a bull or a goat
[1:14:57] could never come into a man or a woman
[1:15:00] and change their nature what remember
[1:15:03] the blood of bulls got only cupboards
[1:15:04] and never took sin away so so he lives
[1:15:07] with that temper problem all of his life
[1:15:09] amen but
[1:15:11] but the thing is under the blood of
[1:15:13] Jesus Christ if he lived under the blood
[1:15:15] of Jesus Christ that Temple would have
[1:15:16] been gone
[1:15:18] why because the life and the blood the
[1:15:20] Holy Ghost would would have come in him
[1:15:22] and taken that temper out of him
[1:15:24] um that's why I'm so thankful as we'll
[1:15:25] say that we're here there's a
[1:15:27] Transformation Center where the Holy
[1:15:29] Ghost of life and the blood of Jesus
[1:15:30] Christ comes into you and I and changes
[1:15:32] our nature to match his word
[1:15:34] Hallelujah
[1:15:37] amen it was one of the greatest it was
[1:15:39] one of the greatest things now when the
[1:15:43] lamb and the dove met together and that
[1:15:47] same thing amen when when when Heaven
[1:15:49] and Earth embraced when they took when
[1:15:51] all the eternities Embrace together and
[1:15:54] that same thing must happen in you and I
[1:15:56] why because the Lord Jesus the blood of
[1:15:58] Christ cleanses us takes our sin nature
[1:16:01] out of us that he can come and dwell in
[1:16:02] us just like he dwelled in the days of
[1:16:06] his flesh there now
[1:16:08] if you look in the Bible when there's
[1:16:10] great changes in time there's always a
[1:16:13] character in the scripture that has the
[1:16:16] character of Christ that displays a real
[1:16:18] meekness now we went through Moses he
[1:16:20] was one of them he was the meekest man
[1:16:22] in all the Earth after the burning bush
[1:16:24] experience but then the Lord Jesus would
[1:16:27] say he'd prophesy the day we live and
[1:16:29] say as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:16:31] it'd also be in the days of the son of
[1:16:33] man they'd eat they drank their married
[1:16:35] wives they were given a marriage until
[1:16:36] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[1:16:38] and the flood came and destroyed them
[1:16:39] all likewise also it wasn't the days of
[1:16:41] lot they'd eat they drank they bought
[1:16:43] they sold they planted they build it but
[1:16:45] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[1:16:47] it rain fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:16:49] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:16:51] have been the day when the son of man is
[1:16:53] revealed so the Lord Jesus is looking
[1:16:55] and taking past events and saying these
[1:16:58] events when you see them repeat
[1:17:00] on the Earth again you're on the end
[1:17:02] times there's going to be a junction in
[1:17:03] time there's going to be a change going
[1:17:04] on
[1:17:06] and so now I just want to take in the
[1:17:07] days of lot because in the days of lot
[1:17:09] was in the days when Abraham was upon
[1:17:11] the Earth and Abraham was a was a Meek
[1:17:14] man he's the father of the faith
[1:17:17] he was a Meek man
[1:17:19] now
[1:17:22] we have this example here where where
[1:17:24] where where Abraham's herdsmen and lots
[1:17:27] herdsmen are striving together
[1:17:29] and so Abraham didn't say it a lot
[1:17:31] listen lot God called me
[1:17:33] I spoke to God has God spoken to you a
[1:17:36] lot
[1:17:37] has God has God walking with you lot no
[1:17:40] God called me lot you're just following
[1:17:42] along you're just getting blessings from
[1:17:44] walking with me did he do that no he
[1:17:47] didn't do that he said okay okay buddy I
[1:17:49] like this because he's like you know
[1:17:50] trying to calm him down this is Abraham
[1:17:53] talking a lot Abraham's the older guy
[1:17:55] there you know and he's trying to say
[1:17:57] okay no it's all right let's not fight
[1:18:00] anymore
[1:18:01] you look up look we're up on this hill
[1:18:04] have a look around where do you want to
[1:18:06] live you you choose you get first dibs
[1:18:09] and then I'll take the rest
[1:18:10] why did he do that because he was meek
[1:18:14] why did he do that because he had a
[1:18:16] visitation of God over and over again
[1:18:18] because he knew that natural blessings
[1:18:22] were not the blessing he was after it
[1:18:24] was not the blessing that was revealed
[1:18:26] to him it was revealed to him he had
[1:18:27] received the promised son
[1:18:29] Hallelujah that's what he was looking
[1:18:31] for a visitation of God that they could
[1:18:33] have the promised son that they could
[1:18:35] have Isaac amen so so in this great
[1:18:37] Junction here was a man you think you
[1:18:40] think about Abraham he had a right to
[1:18:41] being annoyed
[1:18:43] with lot remember God didn't call lot
[1:18:47] God called Abraham
[1:18:50] but Abraham was happy for a lot to come
[1:18:52] with
[1:18:54] but there had to come a time where there
[1:18:56] had to be a separation between them and
[1:18:58] it wasn't Abraham pushing lot out it was
[1:19:01] like making a choice but you see Abraham
[1:19:04] Abraham chose God's way
[1:19:07] he chose God's way he stayed on the
[1:19:09] mountain top there wasn't much grass for
[1:19:11] the cattle but lot a type of the
[1:19:12] backslidden world the church doesn't
[1:19:13] believe in the miraculous when it
[1:19:15] finally come come till those things
[1:19:17] wound around into God until they had to
[1:19:20] come a junction there had to be a time
[1:19:22] for Abraham was heir of the land oh God
[1:19:24] why can't Christian see blessed of the
[1:19:25] pure in heart they shall see God blessed
[1:19:28] are the meek they shall inherit the
[1:19:29] earth The Junction times at hand for
[1:19:31] father to show that we're at the end
[1:19:33] time so in this Junction time because
[1:19:36] remember Abraham was approaching a time
[1:19:38] where where Sodom and Gomorrah were
[1:19:40] going to be destroyed which is an
[1:19:42] example of this Gentile world is doomed
[1:19:44] sorry to say but it's doomed right but
[1:19:47] there had to be a there had to be a man
[1:19:49] upon the Earth that had the character of
[1:19:51] Christ in this Junction time aiming to
[1:19:53] stand in the gap for lot to stand in the
[1:19:56] gap for those who really weren't visited
[1:19:58] like he was amen but you see the see the
[1:20:01] visitation of God did not make Abraham
[1:20:03] proud if we're proud oh I'm a Believer I
[1:20:06] know where I'm going I'm going in a
[1:20:07] rapture look at me I'm better than
[1:20:08] everyone else you don't you actually
[1:20:10] haven't met God
[1:20:11] it's just all in here if it's in here
[1:20:14] you'll be like Abraham you'll be like
[1:20:16] Moses you'll definitely be like the Lord
[1:20:18] Jesus
[1:20:19] amen amen but if it's all in the head
[1:20:22] well that's just not going to do you no
[1:20:24] good
[1:20:24] but you see there had to be a man here
[1:20:27] there had to be a man that was willing
[1:20:29] to give lot the best place see but
[1:20:32] Abraham the man of God gave lot his
[1:20:34] choice and taken what was left oh I love
[1:20:36] that a real believer will give you your
[1:20:38] choice he's willing to take what's left
[1:20:40] there's no selfishness in a real
[1:20:41] believer no not at all
[1:20:44] amen so that's because why because he's
[1:20:46] a real believer see Abraham was Meek he
[1:20:49] was gentle but he wasn't he wasn't too
[1:20:52] Meek that when when when the kings were
[1:20:55] fighting and lot was taken captive and
[1:20:57] all of his people he wasn't Meek in a
[1:20:59] way that oh that that he just sat back
[1:21:01] and said well I guess that's just that's
[1:21:02] just uh lot's portion no he earned his
[1:21:05] servants who weren't even soldiers and
[1:21:07] went and got back lot
[1:21:10] praise the Lord that's real meekness
[1:21:12] amen the enemy's coming and got my
[1:21:14] family struck me with sickness struck
[1:21:17] someone Something's Happened
[1:21:19] it's
[1:21:21] let's take the sword of the word
[1:21:23] let's go after them Amen in prayer and
[1:21:26] love
[1:21:27] Hallelujah that's what Abraham did amen
[1:21:29] who's who's with me today amen we're the
[1:21:31] children of Faith right amen this is who
[1:21:33] we are is what the Lord Jesus has made
[1:21:34] us
[1:21:36] amen hallelujah you see now
[1:21:39] you know the whole armor of God
[1:21:42] we know the whole armor of God is is
[1:21:45] displayed there in Ephesians right the
[1:21:47] whole armor of God but how is that armor
[1:21:49] manifested it's actually the fruits of
[1:21:51] the spirit it all ties together because
[1:21:53] the armor of God is not a natural armor
[1:21:55] we've got a helmet and a sword and a
[1:21:57] shield somewhere here but that's not I I
[1:21:59] could never give those to you and say
[1:22:01] now you've got the helmet of salvation
[1:22:02] the sword of the spirit of the shield of
[1:22:04] Faith No they're just
[1:22:07] toys
[1:22:09] it's not the armor of God the Holy Ghost
[1:22:11] is actually the armor of God Amen the
[1:22:13] Holy Ghost is described in different
[1:22:14] ways but it is the Holy Ghost is the
[1:22:17] armor of God and then amen and then but
[1:22:19] how does this armor work right see it's
[1:22:21] got to be love
[1:22:23] D joy peace long-suffering goodness
[1:22:25] meekness patience gentleness is that
[1:22:27] right everything's Supernatural there's
[1:22:29] nothing natural about the armor amen see
[1:22:32] and so our character must be
[1:22:33] Supernatural as well
[1:22:35] a real Supernatural meekness and
[1:22:37] gentleness amen
[1:22:39] why but but why do we want to be this
[1:22:41] way that God can impart eternal life I'm
[1:22:44] gonna I'm gonna wrap this up soon
[1:22:45] remember Jesus will say I said you he
[1:22:48] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:22:50] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:22:52] these shall they do because they go into
[1:22:54] my father and whatsoever ye shall ask
[1:22:57] pardon me in my name
[1:22:59] that will I do that the father may be
[1:23:01] glorified in the son so he that
[1:23:04] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:23:06] shall he do also and greater than these
[1:23:08] why because I go unto my father now so
[1:23:12] the works that he did what did he do
[1:23:13] raise the dead heal the sick cast out
[1:23:16] the Devils control nature cleanse the
[1:23:18] lepers and all those different things
[1:23:19] right that's what he did
[1:23:22] if you believe on him you'll do those
[1:23:24] works
[1:23:25] Mark 16 in action is still the general
[1:23:27] orders of the church
[1:23:28] amen that is still in manifestation I
[1:23:31] know some Bibles have a footnote saying
[1:23:33] that those verses not inspired but I
[1:23:35] just Rejoice because I've seen it happen
[1:23:36] so so if it's not inspired and guys
[1:23:39] still use it what happens if you take
[1:23:40] the inspired word and use it to but to
[1:23:43] me it's all inspired amen it's all the
[1:23:46] word of God but these Greater Works what
[1:23:48] is the Greater Works the Greater Works
[1:23:50] is the imparting of eternal life
[1:23:53] amen amen amen hallelujah
[1:23:56] amen you know you know you can impartied
[1:23:58] God can he party eternal life through
[1:24:00] you
[1:24:02] I mean Christianity is more than just
[1:24:04] coming to church and saying you believe
[1:24:05] in Jesus which is all part of it but
[1:24:07] essentially God can use you remember
[1:24:08] you're you're part of his body right
[1:24:10] here's the head we are the body right
[1:24:12] and what life comes through the body
[1:24:14] amen so so we can God can use us to
[1:24:18] impart
[1:24:19] eternal life so he says the Greater
[1:24:21] Works was to have power in the church
[1:24:23] not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast
[1:24:26] out Devils by prayer but to impart
[1:24:28] eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost
[1:24:30] was coming and given to the hands of the
[1:24:32] church to impart life oh that's what
[1:24:34] Calvary meant it took stupid degraded
[1:24:37] men and women and lifted them into a
[1:24:39] place to be Sons and Daughters of God to
[1:24:42] heal the sick to impart eternal life by
[1:24:44] giving the Holy Ghost to obedient
[1:24:46] Believers men who are once unbelievers
[1:24:48] be made Believers and in part spiritual
[1:24:51] eternal life
[1:24:52] Hallelujah
[1:24:54] Acts chapter 10 what life was imparted
[1:24:57] amen through the woods of Peter wasn't
[1:24:59] just Peter speaking those things
[1:25:00] recounting in a historical event no God
[1:25:02] anointed it and what they received the
[1:25:05] Holy Ghost
[1:25:06] amen how much greater is it to say this
[1:25:09] sick woman laying here I pray a prayer
[1:25:11] of faith and she'll be healed that's a
[1:25:12] great thing but what but that's what he
[1:25:15] was doing then but greater than this
[1:25:17] shall you do I'm going to give you power
[1:25:18] not only to raise him up for a while but
[1:25:20] to give me eternal life which will be
[1:25:22] Eternal forever blind poor Richard
[1:25:24] people how do you miss it don't you see
[1:25:26] that the greater thing is that's the
[1:25:28] greatest thing could ever happen was to
[1:25:30] impart eternal life to people what is
[1:25:33] eternal life the life that he lived the
[1:25:35] life that was in him impart that to
[1:25:37] others can a man do it a Son of God can
[1:25:41] now that doesn't mean you go around on
[1:25:43] your own just oh I'm going to give this
[1:25:45] person eternal life today that's not
[1:25:46] what he's talking about and that's not
[1:25:48] what we're talking about what I'm
[1:25:49] talking about is you're so surrendered
[1:25:51] to God that God could anoint you to
[1:25:54] speak to somebody and faith will raise
[1:25:56] in their hearts and they'll receive the
[1:25:57] Holy Ghost
[1:25:59] oh that's a preacher's job no we're all
[1:26:01] part of the same body amen if you truly
[1:26:03] have a lamb nature and the Holy Ghost
[1:26:05] has descended upon you made as Abode and
[1:26:08] he's living through your life God can
[1:26:10] use you to impart that life to somebody
[1:26:11] else
[1:26:13] you don't have to just say preach them a
[1:26:15] sermon
[1:26:15] but you live a life you can speak to
[1:26:18] them and after you spoke to them you can
[1:26:20] say where did that come from
[1:26:22] that was God speaking to that person
[1:26:25] this is not this is not Pie in the Sky
[1:26:27] stuff you read it in the book of Acts
[1:26:29] and we've been returned back to the book
[1:26:30] of Acts where the Holy Ghost is in the
[1:26:32] church doing the same things he did back
[1:26:34] then because he's the same yesterday
[1:26:36] today and forever
[1:26:39] Hallelujah but what does it take
[1:26:41] a meek
[1:26:42] humble gentle loving
[1:26:46] long-suffering full of love nature
[1:26:50] with patience
[1:26:52] that's what we need I'm not saying we
[1:26:54] don't have it but we're going to look at
[1:26:56] man
[1:26:57] Lord Jesus make me more like thee
[1:27:00] yeah you know after studying these
[1:27:02] things about Lord I want to be meek
[1:27:04] I want to be like you Lord I don't want
[1:27:06] to be angry and frustrated and negative
[1:27:08] and you know balling people out and just
[1:27:10] feeling so you know I don't want to be
[1:27:13] like that Lord change me to match you
[1:27:15] that you can do what you want to do
[1:27:17] through me that because remember a
[1:27:20] testimony of anything God does it's
[1:27:22] actually not the person it's God doing
[1:27:24] it it's a testimony of what God did not
[1:27:26] what the person did see if we put
[1:27:29] ourselves in any testimony well we've
[1:27:31] got a wrong
[1:27:33] we got a wrong motive to begin with
[1:27:35] amen we must be meek yield and humble
[1:27:38] that God can live
[1:27:40] who wants who wants to see God live
[1:27:43] amen who wants to who wants to have that
[1:27:45] kind of a nature
[1:27:46] amen remember but character is a victory
[1:27:49] not a gift
[1:27:51] so what is that victory victory over
[1:27:53] this own self Lord take my nature
[1:27:57] change it Lord
[1:28:00] may I die on your altar Lord Jesus that
[1:28:03] I can be born again
[1:28:05] that after whatever I don't know what
[1:28:07] experience may happen to you but then
[1:28:09] after that moment you'll see a life
[1:28:11] change
[1:28:12] where you see the word of God living
[1:28:15] you see his character manifested
[1:28:17] amen let's have the musicians this
