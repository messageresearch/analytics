you amen praise the Lord so chaste Yvonne feels at home I mean let's go to look see if that slideshows going I mean I trust everyone's had a good week happy birthday brother Martin look a 10 we're going to read verses 9 downwards to eat do we have that going should be open if not well we just do it old school and read from our Bibles so we gonna look 8 don't worry if it's not there it's not there let's go to Luke 8 in verses 9 and we're gonna read down to verse 15 so Luke 8 and verse 9 there's a parable of the of the sower look a didn't own and there's disciples oh wait something's happening Oh we'll just read it and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be speaking of the parable of the sower and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in parables seeing they might not see hearing they might not understand now the parable now we're doing over here okay now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they that hear then the devil cometh and taketh away the words out of their hearts least they should believe and be saved and they on the rock well that doesn't quote sorry about the formatting and they on the rocker they which hear receive the word with joy and these have no root yet for a while belief and in times of temptation fall away and they which among the thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience and we're just going to read another scripture from Luke if we go back to Luke chapter 4 this may seem a bit unrelated but we're just gonna I'm just gonna read this here and Jesus this after Jesus has been baptized by John and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the will being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command the stone that it be made bread and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God now we know his tim-tim that a couple of times but the same time we won't read them when it comes down to this first and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season a season he didn't just quit he came back made a little Bliss's word you may have your seats this morning in the presence of the Lord what do this this may seem very unusual but I mean maybe some unusual scriptures for you I want to go but I yeah I heard a I heard a message from from overseas on the power of the third Pole and I heard the last part of it this week and it really struck me and I wanted maybe I'm not going to repeat what was said but I want to have try and bring it this way you know we have the greatest weapon that's ever been you know you see in the natural there's an arms race between America and between Russia and China there's an arms race going on with their intercontinental ballistic missiles and different things that they are developing there's an arms race one is trying to outdo the other but in the spiritual realm there is no arms race because we have the greatest weapon it cannot be improved upon it cannot be fashioned a bit better it cannot be made better in any way it is the greatest weapon and you can go from this side of the universe I don't know where we are in the universe in terms of up and down left or right but you go to one inch to the other searched every planet searched every star searched every galaxy searched every wherever and every dimension you'll not find a greater weapon than what we have received amen it doesn't need improving right we have the latest technology holy and it is the best this word we have received is the greatest weapon and it will defeat Satan any place any time anywhere hallelujah and the Prophet told us that the message the entire message in time conditions right every time there's an end time comes upon the earth there's an end time the day of Noah the word he received meat in time conditions what he and his house was saved the the door was open to all anyone could have gone in amen but the people who decided to go and wind in and they were saved hallelujah and every time there's a junction is a change in time the word comes and it meets the challenge of the day I mean so we don't need to be worried what we're facing this weapon we have this word of God we have received is the greatest weapon hallelujah now brother Brown says I'm just gonna you know I'm gonna read this I'm just gonna go from here sorry so brother Branham speaks and looking away to Jesus and he's speaking about the manifestation of the third Pole now we know the third pole is the opening of the word but whenever the word comes open a power is released amen we understand every time the word comes open and any age it comes open a powers released for the believers that receive that word will manifest the promise of the age you go back into Moses as day they were all slaves as Rael was all slaves but a word came open right a promise came open it was no longer a prophecy but now was becoming lived in front of them that Israel would not stay in Egypt they will go to their inheritance of the promised land and when the word came open it gave them power to receive their inheritance right God said God said I will drive them out little by little amen I'll fight the battles but you have to go in and possess the land right but it was God fighting for them hallelujah Caleb was a slave Joshua a slave but the word came open they heard more than Moses the man they went caught up in the humanity of Moses they heard the voice behind the voice they recognized this was the God of Abraham was now working in their day and they received that word and it gave them power caleb was 84 years old he says I'm 84 years old but I have the same strength as I did the day I came out of Egypt now give me my mountain hallelujah and it should be the same thing with you and I we should say God give me my mountain my inheritance I don't just want to run around I don't want to just wander around I want what you have in your word for me I don't want to sit back anymore I'm happy to see other people receive their inheritance but give me my Mountain hallelujah why because the word came open what is a revival and Awakening and The Awakening is to the promise of the age hallelujah it's just like the you know the galaxies the Sun Moon and stars out there it's only been in this you know well a couple of hundred years but especially these last modern era where we can see beyond our galaxies into the far reaches of space and they can you know but the stars are always there the moons are always here the planets were there they're discovering planets around stars because they have the technology to see them they were always there but man has developed the optics to see it and it's the same thing the promises are here right the word this is the full revelation of Jesus Christ right it's been there the whole time but God had to send a prophet with the prophet optics I mean to actually show you this is what you're looking at I said it just presuming saying well I guess it means this is maybe this will happen I mean God sent some optics in this day so we can look into the word he says this is what the promises are this is who you are in Christ this is where you're going hallelujah amen people have been looking through the bar looking at the Bible for 2,000 years wondering what it means it's like they look up at the stars what does this all you know what is this all here did they get the right optics and they see it hallelujah now he sees about the manifestation of the third pole because of when the word as I said when the word comes open to a people it releases a power you see on the day of Pentecost Jesus preached for three and a half years and the word that he sowed into the disciples I mean god quick in that word and then at birth the book of Acts church hallelujah where the people were not bowed by the pressure of the age they are not bad by the political pressure or the religious pressure the threats of man they weren't worried about that they said who should we please your God it's very simple if God's fall showing us this and it's changed our lives it's not just empty words but it's a reality to us what are we gonna do tell me hallelujah as I said last week Mary was the only one there when the angel spoke to her it didn't validate her testimony hallelujah but a testimony manifested she had the child she had the Christ child and the vindication she had the Christ shoulders the Upper Room happened God came down and filled his people hallelujah so you know it's whenever the word comes open and now the seven thunders that were hidden john was commanded not to write them in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound them it all that the mystery of God should be finished so it's no longer a thunder it's a voice I mean when Jesus was upon the earth and he said Gluck yeah I've glorified thy name and here's a voice from heaven saying I've glorified it now glorified again some heard of thunder some heard a voice I mean so those who the Thunder they didn't understand it but those who heard the voice understood it right there's no longer a thunder no more I mean it's a voice we know what the scripture says hallelujah so when it comes open it produces a power it releases a power to those who believe it it will produce what it's promised to do it's a brother Branham says now and so when he speaks about the vindication of the third pole he speaks about the tumor being spoken out of his wife side causes that to disappear yeah the squirrels to be created the storm to be spoken out of existence is afoot you know the fish you know the life to come back into the little fish I mean his five deals five what he call it vindications of the spoken word okay now any season if Christ lives in me this isn't looking away to Jesus and if Christ lives in me the works of Christ you'll do right it's it's got to be and what does Christ the word he said if you abide in me my word in you then ask what you will it'll be done because the word is in there just needs the light and the light makes it live so now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't see it all along and that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long at least many years four or five years maybe longer the third poll has now been vindicated and I'm sure you know what it is now remember that they'll never be an impersonation of that cuz it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existence and I have I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it but it will not be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up and when it does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything that can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily will be manifested in the fullness of its power hallelujah so a tumor if I knows the story amen his wife meet he had a had a tumor they went to the doctors you know it started to get bigger and bigger and bigger got to the size of a grapefruit and then brother bran wasn't even where she was she was going to go to the surgery she were and then the power God came down upon the Prophet and and and under an inspiration he just said Lord when the surgeon goes to cut mate disappear and the surgeon goes to cut and then the tumor disappeared amen and he was all mystified looks at the x-rays again looks at her where's it gone a tumor the size of a grapefruit is not a small thing I mean but God came down and caused that God moved upon the Prophet right to speak the word and the tumor disappeared that's like the same with the storm the storm was spoken her existence the scrolls were created many things happen whatever he said that's just a temporary manifestation but when the squeeze comes down you know we're living in that time amen our you know where we are living in the time there's a there's a religious persecution there's a pressure come on what's it the squeeze is tightening down as I've said about the Jews they didn't wake up one day they were walking on the street nothing wrong the next morning they wake up in Auschwitz no there was a squeeze there was a progression of events and they were getting tightened down and then eventually there in the Holocaust they were in the concentration camps and that was just a natural squeeze amen but we're living in a time of a supernatural squeeze where demon powers released I mean to try and make us disbelieve the word to try and make us shut up to try and make us sit down to try and make us compromise to try and make us quit to try make us give up our Lord Jesus I mean but I say this bride will not be bound she will not be been she will not be she will not cower I mean because we're like we've been restored to the original and the original said what's better sorry please go out a policeman I'm going to please God I'm in the same God that called me out of being a drunk at university I mean is the same drivers lead me today police I will not bow I will not let it become common to me I'm going to press the battle hallelujah and it should be the same thing with you and I this word should make us thrill us more we should love for more we should rejoice it anymore and should never become common and she never just become casual or something we've always done but as word should be richer it should be greater it should be stronger it should be more wonderful hallelujah shouldn't it be their way well I've heard it all all before now God's going to quick in it he's gonna make it alive because it was alive to you you may hear it a million times but there millions Tom will be greater than the first time hallelujah just like hearing a baddy died on Calvary I need some mana to hear brother our mind otherwise I'm gonna blow I mean amen well it's like it's like when you hear about the cross has it become common to those who know it happened for you I mean that when you know he really died for you it's not just a story it's not just a nice idea it's not someone's enthusiasm but you know he wins for you hallelujah it's not common it's not something that you just know it's a reality hallelujah please help me home and I need something Oh amen I'm not gonna tell you to be quiet by the way hey this is a heartfelt religion you say this is just all emotion love is an emotion but you have the love and it produces the emotion right it's not just an empty feeling it's a reality brother Ram said I believe in a heartfelt religion I do too hallelujah love love is a substance it's something real hallelujah amen so now if we are we are living in a day we have to come to a come to a conclusion amen if God be for us who can be against us if God be for you who can be against you nothing can be against you nothing can stop you if God is for you it's God for you what did he die whew yes he died for me did he redeem me within he's for me can he heal me yes he's for me hallelujah if God be for us who can be against us I meant God is not some angry angry godless wanting to punish you how there many times things go funny in our lives we think all God's just angry at us God's not angry what's God angry at job God was pleased with Jove he's a perfect man is known else like him upon the earth he's a perfect man holy and God was pleased with Jove and he allow the trial to come because God knew that Joubert confidence in the land hallelujah and that's why God allows things to come against us just like Jesus the fullness of Godhead bodily was in him here was all of heaven was in a man and Satan comes in tempts them you know that's why God moves and the Devils on our case well that scriptural pattern we shouldn't be surprised he gets filled with the full all of God comes and pours into him after he gets baptized and then the spirit leads him out to be tempted hallelujah and then sometimes the devil comes against us we go oh what's going on these things have to be shouldn't be surprised hallelujah if our bridegroom had to enjoy the same things we will endure the same things hallelujah I wouldn't worry I wouldn't worry too much now so he says when the squeeze comes down that which has been you've seen temporarily can you turn that down a little bit our month will be manifested and the fullness of its power friends we don't just talk about the Lord he's not just something we talk about Christianity is not just something we talk about it's a life it's a manifestation of God that's what real Christianity is we don't just talk about them we really have what we talk about I mean we actually possess everything he's given to us hallelujah and that's why we can't leave the devil push us around no more don't be pushed around by some spirit and when you tell that spirit to get out you have the right the Bible says the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds I mean we're anointed to tear the devil's Kingdom down holy and we are all danger terrors Kingdom down I mean that's your job description in this day you live for him and you care to live for God and care the devil's Kingdom down hallelujah amen we are told when the weakest of Christians who's a Christian today I just put up my hand if I as you who's a Christian this who's a Christian hello Christians when the weakest of Christians gets on their knees doesn't even say em praise amen brother Brown said the kingdom of Hell shakes we we kind of you know we think we're like a bunch of athletes how's my stance how's my personal best how's my nutrition how's all these things going on and we look at our performance oh but I'm feeling weak in faith well when the weakest of Christian gets on their knees he didn't say when the strongest or the one who's feeling the best or the one who's prime the best or when the weakest amen so I can say well I'm a weak Christian hell still shakes pal still shakes hallelujah and I want to see how shake hallelujah realize here's the ark angels Archangels with God never put a foot wrong stood loyal hallelujah they have a conversation with God but then now you begin to pray and you begin to call upon upon your your lover your bridegroom your husband and God has to say them shhh my daughter is talking to me my sons talking to me how I swear all right I gotta listen to what they've got to say hallelujah because you under the blood of Jesus Christ have more authority with God then the Archangels in heaven hallelujah hallelujah because the blood has lifted you up his redemption has lifted you up this word has lifted you up I mean to be in joint ear with him hallelujah that's what we are that's what the Bible says in joint heirs with Christ what does a joint ear mean it's not someone who's down here and he's up here no he lifts us up that we joint with co-equal with God he's how head sure but he lifts us up that's just like a real husband a real husband does not treat down his wife that's a man who's under the law amen and I'll say this as well a real you know there's been studies done that a man if he looks at at all or he looks at a half-naked woman sexy dressed the same parts of his brain I activated so what's happening subconsciously he is looking at that woman the same as Justin at all and this is what this modern society has done to a woman stripped her off that man looks at them subconsciously says they're just tools are you following me so man that your strausser's wife out onto the street like that what's he actually saying you're just a tool I don't actually value or treasure you amen this is free I'm just throwing it out there butBut yeah butBut they've shown it I mean because many times you know it's the liberal as is just as bad as illegal I mean but those who really love the Lord if you really know him what is your heart now Redemption its redemption to your family your whole focus what Scott's focus upon the earth you helliya his whole focus upon the earth is you redeemed amen you are the reason perlier that he's brooding on the earth you're the reason he said the message you're the reason he caused people to go through great hardship that this would be translated I mean that you'd received the word for yourself holier that you would know him you were his focus upon this earth and he has not called you to be a downtrodden woman he has not called you to be a second-class citizen in the kingdom he's not interested in a bunch of servants as a bride he wants a wife he wants someone to be joint heirs with him hallelujah that's why he's called you so now if that is God's focus is that God's focus that's how well that's what I see when I read the scripture all I see when I read the scripture and the message is divine love that's my experience I don't see a bunch of rules and a bunch of you know or you better shape up or ship out now you see divine love that's all I see I'm sorry maybe I've just got blinkers on I don't know I'm awfully happy this way hallelujah but if that is God's if that's God's focus I want my bride hallelujah she's going to be without spot or wrinkle holy I've purchased her Redemption I shed my blood upon the earth so I purchased her but now I'm coming to claim her I bought hallelujah now I'm here upon the earth to claim her I mean that's why the word speaks to your soul that's why it's transformed you and Nicholas God claiming you saying you're part of my Redemption following your part of my plan amen not just something in the site you're the main focus you're my main focus is you hallelujah now if that is God's focus Isis husband shouldn't we be the same way for our family I mean who cares about whatever we've got to do holy our focus should be redemption I want my family to know your Lord I won the same God I met to know you holy that they would open their hearts and give themselves to you that they wouldn't be some down try to people wondering where they belong in life they would know there are densities in you hallelujah I trust moms is the same way too but husband is the head of the family there should be our our plan it shouldn't be no honey I'm too buzzy nerds what are we living for why are we upon the earth I'm not a pot you know I'm not living for my job amen I'm not I'm not living for my job hallelujah I'm not focused upon it I've got to do it do all things as unto the Lord sure that's not my be all and endure that's not my I focus my focus is to walk like Enoch walk and not just me walking like you know what I want my family to walk like Enoch walk I'm under expectation that there'll be a sweet come over us and three little girls won't be three little girls no more BB 18 to 21 hallelujah and our bodies will be changed and we'll be gone that's what I'm looking for is that I don't think there's too far fits its promised hallelujah so shouldn't that be our focus sure we've got a we've got to work right we're going to get an education we're going to do all these things but don't let it define you don't let that be your defining thing many people have been defined by their work and what's it done for them when they've gone from this world to the next world but others have been destitute downcast whatever more and the Bible says of whom the world is not worthy that's how great they were the world wasn't worthy of their presence Howell ouya Amen so now what we need to do so now when the squeeze comes on what you've seen manifested temporarily will be manifested in the fullness of its power so now yeah and yeah yeah I was I was very more thinking about those words the fullness of its power so not just something a little bit it's the fullness of it now you say well where is that power that powers in you if the Holy Ghost is in you man I just pray I just look at your face I say Lord give them such a assurance not because it's not about what I say I mean it's not like it's by jury and I'm the judge saying well you're in you're out that's not how it works man wants to know I either bribed a do you think on the bride or not the bride that's irrelevant that's what God is that's what God says to you amen it's when God comes first he says you're one of them you're one of mine I mean that's what the Bible says you've got it's an individual walk between you and God hallelujah but I just pray Lord give them all such an assurance I mean they can be going through the worst trial that they've ever yo ever going through but they're rejoicing hallelujah they're just happy I mean this they're so glad you say how's things going on as well naturally it's going terrible everything imagine it's happening and you thinking it worse I haven't finished but but I know in whom I have believed I mean I know who is called for me I know who's my redeemer I know he's purchased my salvation I know I'm been set free I'm free indeed holy I know that the blood has paid my price Amen I'm on my road to heaven sphere land that's how it should be holy should have been that way Amen so that power because remember I'll get there but the thing is though remember what was in the disciples there there they are the good and honest hearts Judas heard the mysteries of the kingdom - but he what he didn't have a good Nonna's heart he got offended hey man he got offended and he went and did his thing but there they were they were the prepared ground they're hearing words from a man that they'd never heard before not a man spake like this man hallelujah and then finally now this is just me but it's like God saying well I'm not just going to plant I'm gonna produce a crop then I'm going to really show them what's been sown unto them I mean it now it's not just gonna be just following me and seeing what I do I'm gonna show them the same life that was in me as in them hallelujah and then they go to the they go to the Upper Room friends we can ever Pentecost every day hallelujah hallelujah brother BAM see a man can be so drunk on the spirit ago he can be drunk on the Spirit of God every day of his life until God takes him home hallelujah so you cannot have one sober moment haha hallelujah amen really really hallelujah don't put God in a box that's why we shouldn't put God in the Box when we come to service every nor even when we open the scripture I mean listen to the message don't put God in a box well I've read their scripture before read it again I've heard their message before read it again it'll speak something new to you and will quicken something you do hallelujah let's not put God in a box the rest the world has got him figured out they think I mean but God just goes you can't box me hallelujah do you think you do you think you've experienced it at all this is not about more hallelujah all those who great meetings are hold on you wait you wait amen so we can't just put God in the box we should be saying Lordan you're the all-powerful Almighty God and you've decided and you have decided to come down identify yourself of me have your way do what you want hallelujah but it's the devil that tries to put God in a box and clamp down and try make us to be quiet try and make our mind to be distracted on other things hallelujah we're going to kick him out I don't I don't live my life out of fear of the devil amen why should we do that we should live our lives out of love of God amen so now there they are they come up to the upper room God comes down and then God's going to show them now I'm going to show you what's in you and then the pressure comes on the pressure comes on here Simon Peter pressure comes on in pilots judgement Hall he curses and denies the Lord pressure came on now here's the same one and it's not just seed laying dormant and soil it's now coming to life I mean because now the light struck that see other because he is in the upper room God came down is now in him and God's going to show this is what sin you know and and he just stands and says well what should we do to please God or please men you tell us and they get beaten in another place and they go out they rejoice hallelujah thank you Lord that we've been beating on your account now that sounds a bit weird doesn't it but God is we are a bunch of oddballs to the world I mean we are a bunch of oddballs because because the devil in his mind saying let's just intimidate them let's put pressure on let's drag them before the same counsel that crucified their so-called Messiah and we'll make them Bend and they just went in there and said well I'm sorry you're too late I'm sorry I'm sorry we just we had the prot the promise of the Prophet Joel happened to us God has poured out a spirit he's now in me hallelujah you're too late you can't say Jesus wasn't our Messiah because his blood works because now he's in me I mean the God you claim to serve us now and me hallelujah they were too late and that's why they didn't bow and then they went and then they breathing out threatenings upon them I'm kind of mixing up all the persecution go read the book of Acts the early part and then and then and then they come and they have a prayer meeting they didn't sit around and talk about what the enemy tried to do to them they just prayed hallelujah because they're talking to the real one who could help them and God came down and fill the plane filled them again shook the place and they went out with boldness hallelujah amen aren't you glad that's why I think that's why we come to church isn't it I come for a refilling hallelujah I care for another baptism one baptism many fillings the Prophet says so I've received a I've been baptized and the Holy Ghost but I want to refill it I want my cup to be overflowing I want to be drinking from my saucer hallelujah cause my cup overflows that's what I want to be like amen so God will allow the devil to put that pressure on to show what was in the disciples I mean it's the same thing with the squeeze and this current climate we're in the squeeze coming down is to show what's in you that's all it does it proves what's in you it doesn't actually activate what's well love many people look for the squeeze and say well when the squeeze comes in God's really get a pour a spirit out no it just shows what's already in you I'll put it that way it's just showing what's already in you amen the Spirit is moving God is pouring himself out hallelujah it's merely showing what's in you amen so now this you say well we've got to wait for it to get real bad first and then it'll be manifested the fullness of its power no I say now I say now what are we waiting for what are we waiting for hallelujah you're following me now brother Brahim see see it's in divine love I'll put this one up we'll see how the if not I'll read it sorry about the I tried to squish it too much now you've got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it they were all in the upper room with one Accord then suddenly there came from heaven as a sound of a Russian mighty wind the atmosphere was right it takes an atmosphere to do anything you know the regular procedure to hatch chickens is to put them under the hen but get the egg in the right atmosphere it'll hatch anyhow listen brother if a man loves God and the right kind of an atmosphere he could get into it'll produce newborn babe just as certain as I'm here it's the atmosphere that counts let this little handful of people sitting here tonight and I'll say this morning get in the perfect atmosphere watch what takes place there will not be a feeble won't one an hour much the cripples will walk the blind will see the Deaf will hear the dumb will speak without prayer or anything it's the atmosphere that's how 5000 was healed at one prayer in Africa when they seen the Lord do something it created our atmosphere and they stepped into it there's the pool when the waters is running right he's talking about the Pool of Bethesda this is this the atmosphere that does it hallelujah that's why it's important that's why it's important when we come to church we're ready I mean we don't have to wait for the end of service now I'm in a good condition we're really in a good condition we're prayed up with Carsten every imagination is the salt itself above the Word of God I mean we turn the other cheek to our family whatever going on and you've got to come to a conclusion well it's Saturday night that's why this trouble at Sunday morning that's why it's trouble it's Wednesday night that's why there's trouble in the family why cuz the devil starts workin ever hard day but for me the hardest days I have is Wednesday amen Saturday can be pretty hard to not always I'm not at work but you know Saturday night why what's happening the devil is trying to get us trouble that when we come to church our minds all like scrambled eggs right we don't know what's going on because we've got all this going on right but let's just push it to one side that's why I'm trying to get you to I said Lord may they enter in you begin to enjoy the service a little bit say Amen a few times there's an atmosphere will be created around you I mean where God will come down god inhabits the praises of his people hallelujah you ever thought about that God inhabits your praise Amen and and that is that is from your heart hallelujah so you want God to come around you just begin to praise him a little bit thank you thank you Lord for saving me thank you thank you Lord for setting me free once I was lost now I am found hallelujah I'm glory bound thank you thank you Lord for saving me what's happening you begin to praise him and then your mood begins to shift how they go maybe it'd be all grumpy and twisted up he's forgetting to sing some the Bible says to sing spiritual Psalms sing songs in your heart sing them to one another why because you create an atmosphere yeah music has great power it brings two spirits either God or the devil I don't want the devil I want God right I want him that's why you gone to the mall do you go anywhere this it's like you're in a club somewhere what's going on I'm buying I'm buying veggies what you know it's just so weird isn't it really because normally it's like all the music fits the place now now it's just the same music everywhere that's pretty weird and maybe you even thought about it some of you looking at me like what you talking about but you know it's just it's like you're in this it's like I'm back in some scary club with all these lights and stuff go like I used to back in the hungry I'm glad that day is not here anymore and that guy died hallelujah but you know but why is that cuz there's an atmosphere trying to be created amen and spirits actually dwell in places amen just like the first first place we rendered here there was a demon spirit in the place I won't tell the whole testimony but we came to a point where said this is not right we cast a thing out we had perfect peace after that everything was fine and the day we move out a neighbor said are you the woman who used to rent that place she was using it as a brothel so those deeds that she was doing brought that spirit into the place well if that's the case on the bed what about the real what about on the genuine sign the deeds you do Amy we'll bring a spoon unto a place hallelujah that's why when we come home it should be just such a peace may the devil remember he had any left him for a season so the devil doesn't just wave his white flag and say well well they're the Lord's now I quit I'll find someone else to bully no he tries to come back but as I said the reason but but now there's a resistance I trust is a resistance in your life wholly aware the devil used to come in and he'd just ride you like Seabiscuit you know he'd just do whatever he wanted because you were his slave but then there's a revolution you rose up and you realize who you really were and now the devil comes against you and now he tries to come in but you just but the strong man in the house I'm it keeps the door shut and if he keeps knocking the strong man goes up and punches him in the face and sees him on his way hallelujah is that right guess why we're not all the devil's on my case well what are you doing about it I mean the same blood he think oh if the Prophet was here he would pray the same blood that redeemed him the same Holy Ghost that was in him as in the bride right the very same one the very same one that was in our Messiah as in you the very same God amen your brother I'm said if you had a shadow of the power of God you can do anything amen you have their very crater that's it let there be Sun Moon and stars isn't you we don't believe in a Trinity or two lords or you know the Holy Ghost is not different to the crater he is the creator a man he is our Lord Jesus right so the same one that created all things now comes and dwells and you amen so now so all power where is all power I need to get to the text I want to read well I'll get to it now but you know all power where's all power if God is in you all powers in you and you have the authority remember it's not your parrot says power but you have the authority to use it just like a little bitty policeman two-by-four maybe as wide as he is tall he can you know he can be tripping over his uniform but he has the authority I'll say because we have a countrywide police force of the whole country behind him and he can be this big and be the skinniest runt is how he got and no one knows but he's a policeman you know how did I get in I don't know but I'm a Christian hallelujah that's the main thing doesn't matter whatever ability I thought I may have it's not our ability now it's God's ability that's the only thing that counts and everyone has to listen to that policeman because he has the authority of the country behind him all the power of the state is behind the policeman and if anyone tries to challenge him he can call back up hallelujah amen he can call back up we have backup amen all of heaven is behind you you have the best backup right don't just escalate it you know even one angel do you know what you have you know what this word this this word they talk about hypersonic missiles and a you know atomic hydrogen bombs hypersonic missiles we've got more than that I mean I'm not worried about that let them build them go for it knock yourself out we have a better weapon what we don't need to live in fear Oh intimidation listen listen this you know there's always been a timid ation against the believer when Martin Luther protested the Catholic Church do you think they just hit oh he must oh we don't like what he's saying so we'll just let him go no they wrote pamphlets they you know they they spread through their social media did it faze him no the just shall live by faith I've been justified by faith I don't need to do those things that just shall live by faith giving John Wesley the Anglican Church didn't rejoice in his experience when he heard the book of Romans being read and it warmed his heart aurorae exposition on the book of Romans by Martin Luther it warmed his heart he did they weren't rejoicing he had to go open-air preaching they weren't happy he just pressed on do you think the original Pentecostal church not even was rejoicing some bishops in America said it was the last vomit of Satan and they told that they told their congregations about it did it face them no they just went on now if that's speed all the way through just like Paul comes to some place in the book of X and and and the Jews asked him or they said what is the sect of Jesus that ever at spoken evil against spirits do not die by their fruits you shall know them amen so if they had pressure if they had hardship and now this is the most evil of all the ages all the evil of the ages is heaped up into this H all the glory of the past ages is heaped up into this age do you think we're just going to walk you know everything's peachy economies going well the world's going fine and we take a rapture we don't have any trouble no no no no we're gonna let you look at you look at um you know so we shouldn't be surprised because the devil knows who you are if they'll be who who identified the Messiah more in Jesus's day it wasn't the scribes of Pharisees who had the who had the quotes of the prophets and who actually say yes he should be you if they actually sat down with the prophecies and say yeah he matches and he's got a supernatural ministry to vindicate that he matches no it was the it was the demon spirit saying thou art the Son of God have you covered two minutes before the time they knew who he was and sometimes people look at you and you can see it's not them looking at you is something else who's experienced that before amen demon power looks at you because they know what you are and are they happy no because God said he's going to have a bride all that the father has given me will come to me and all that come to me I'll no wise cast out so as soon as that God Jesus said that God said that Satan saying I'm going to stop it not all that's given to you are going to come to you that's his ambition but God just says no I'm not gonna let you win hallelujah but that's why we have a lot of pressure and hardships because it has to be this way you know people seem Noah building the ark maybe the first day he talks about how bad the world is he had a lot of sympathizers you're right this world has got evil it's got bad and then maybe he lays the keel and they begin to see how big it is maybe something we're going to say okay we'll go with you then eventually as the thing gets built people begin to pull themselves away because as the word was getting more made manifest that's when the devil senses criticism greater and greater and greater Jesus starts his ministry look at this young rabbi who's raised up multitudes their healing miraculous taking place he begins to open the word up I'm my father or one what happens now that's when the sympathised wind to pull away eat my flesh drink my blood unless you do this you don't have eternal life you wanna have eternal life eat my flesh drink my blood oh don't say that too late he said it he didn't explain it not at all I mean he walked with him no more so it no was yes so it's the same thing today when the wood becomes manifested hallelujah that's when the persecution comes on more because God is manifesting himself and bride for a men and a bride has begin to see Ordos see who she is amen you know it's like this this country wants to have or the world once a you topic society with there's no racism the only way that can happen is if they become believers that is the only way it can ever happen amen just like brother and poem brother ed one around my dinner table talking about the what peace and reconciliation commission or whatever thing in South Africa after the apartheid fell I said the only way you could ever actually have that happen and it's your the right way as if believers around with the peace and reconciliation amen isn't that right so the only way that there will be a new topic society is when we're in the Millennium there won't be racism in the millennium but there's no carnal man there's no national spirits living it's just God living hallelujah isn't that wonderful and that's why we can look at each other and say they're bright this is the word this is the word this is the word doesn't matter where we have come from we've come from heaven that's why we have all things in common hallelujah I mean but hey I'm just glad we're going now so it's the atmosphere we won't ever right atmosphere one atmosphere of faith not an atmosphere of doubt atmosphere of faith hallelujah that's why I say no the Lord is able to deliver are they three Hebrew children they just said to King Nebuchadnezzar they had a good atmosphere of faith around them if God delivers us praise the Lord if not what we're not gonna bow throw us in we won't be careful how we'll respond this is our answer I mean then what happened the angel your God came down the fire had fellowship with them that a glorious time why cuz that hemisphere of faith amen now this power saw so the power of the third Pole Amen is manifested in the right atmosphere of faith now I want to say this the brides heart has been turned back to the original faith right we have been turned back amen we have been turned back to the original faith hallelujah so now so so we're not waiting for it to happen Malachi 4 has turned our hearts amen has he turned your heart I was my heart was in the world and unbelief wherever it was but then God the voice turned it I got anointed that voice to my heart I meant and he turned me back to the original faith of the fathers Alleluia so now in order for this third pulp for the for the manifestation of this third pull power amen we have to have the right atmosphere of faith and I believe we have it but that's why the devil tries to pull us into an argument or into unbelief or to doubt it's because he's trying to break us out of that atmosphere I mean but we Isis like brother brain with the maniac that came in front of front of him on the platform in Oregon and I was at Tommy Osbourne was in the meeting I believe it was all or one of the bitten spiders ministry greatly and that big demon-possessed man came up a final brother Brahma says I'll tear you limb from limb and spit in his face and you know cursed him and all these things and what was he trying to do he was trying to get brother Branham to come out of being in a spiritual atmosphere down into a carnal atmosphere and if he did that then he would have been torn limb from limb I mean but bro Brown kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere and because he did that and he actually felt sorry for the man because he saw the man was in a cage of demon power no one wants to see someone demon possessed I trust you don't Amen so he felt sorry for the man and in the man said know what yeah and then and then and then God spoke through brother barons head because now you have challenged the spirit of living God you'll fall at my feet and in the man said oh sure whose feet who's full on who he went to punch him he fell down it you know pin brother hands feet to the floor so and policemen or whatever had to drag him off his feet and then begin to start preaching now as I sang or continued on now I was saying faith is the substance and Samba going to get healed here and healing just begin to break out over the whole service why because the head devil Amen in that place was defeated he following me the heaven hid devil was defeated there and then once the he won was defeated than the other ones lost a grip and then people gonna rise up on faith I mean and we're healed and delivered hallelujah he say well that was the prophets ministry we are a continuation Elijah continued Elijah's ministry right the same anointing that was on Elijah was on Elijah but in a double portion I mean to the same the same ministry the prophet head is now in the bride hallelujah so now he say well what's that got to do with us I said this we keeping a spiritual atmosphere of faith a mere we you know we want to seek Jesus come on the scene hallelujah who wants to see Jesus come upon the scene I mean more than just well going through the motions but God does supernaturally come down I mean in deliver and to heal and to redeem I mean that's what I want to see this is what the Bible teaches me amen I'm expecting it shouldn't we expect the supernatural to take place I mean we don't you know you say well where's this in the scripture there was a surfer nation woman amen her daughter was tormented by a devil she came to Jesus I don't have it up there but she comes from saying saying thou son of David have mercy on me he ignored her didn't it didn't it didn't stop her faith she knew if she can just get him to say the right things I mean then that girl will be delivered the girl wasn't with her she was somewhere else she comes to say that's our David have mercy on me Jesus didn't answer word god help me help me this Gentile faith is coming I mean Gentile faith is coming on the scene because she has a Gentile Lord help me and then she and but then he said well it's not meat for the children's bread to be given to the dogs so Jesus called her a dog that didn't just that didn't change her change her attitude she said truth Lord but crumbs still come down to the table underlined and then the dogs eat it up hallelujah and and he was pleased with that response he said gone fine and then what you believe you shall receive it and she went home and found her daughter totally healthy and well that demon left her hallelujah that is the power of the third Paul I mean that is the private third Pole hallelujah that's why we should have such an atmosphere and attitude around us God you've done it before you're the same one today you're not a different God you haven't diminished in power you haven't diminished in any kind of way or God I have a need Lord I need you to come upon the scene for me lord have mercy upon me hallelujah we don't want to just sit back don't be don't be um don't shrink back because you may think you may not get an answer oh are you following me she her faith of course Jesus on the scene to save her daughter hallelujah we don't need squirrels to be spoken into existence that would be cool I don't need it I don't need a blizzard find out there today I'm not interested in those things that's just God showing that this word has power over nature cuz it's the crater himself amen that's just why he's you're showing the message just as the creator speaking through a man amen well we have healing we have salvation I mean we have the devil on our case amen trying to steal our joy trying to upset us trying to make us sick amen we don't have to put up with it we have to come to a case therefore I'm done with you and when you come back again no I haven't changed I'm still done and then he comes back again don't you learn devil the devil don't learn amen he ain't learning you gotta kick him out so she came and she got what she needed hallelujah the woman with the blood issue seen oh if I can just touch the hem of His garment I'll be made whole she was made whole hallelujah and we can still touch him by the feeling of our infirmities amen now that's just going still well here we are I gotta see where I am Jesus says here in Matthew he sees when Jesus came to the coasts of Caesarea Philippi that we don't um he asked his disciples saying who do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias other Jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona means Simon son of Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven now we know that the rock that the church is built upon is the revelation of Jesus Christ what has been revealed who to mean say that I am what's been revealed to them well you're one of the prophets but who do you say that I am what's been revealed to you you are the Christ you are the Messiah Alleluia are the Word made flesh less than an hour Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you man has not given you this revelation but my father in heaven has given you this revelation and upon this rock I will build my church the rock of revelation of the word whereas not in here it's revealed in here amen and when it's revealed in here no man can take it from you no argument can take it from you because you've met Messiah Alleluia and then he says I will give you the keys to the kingdom and what you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven what you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven this is the power given to the church hallelujah yes I'm saying now we've got to take our authority take our badge of believer and start waving it around amen start using what we're given instead of cowering in the corner saying all the devils on my case and putting up with conditions in our body and lukewarmness and laziness and you know just being caught up in lady ousia and hobbies and stuff we're gonna kick it out what is the first place now life should be his word you know it's not a revelation for us together as a church forsake not the assembling of yourselves together for as much as you see the time approach you don't need a revelation it's in the scripture just like baptism is in the scripture right holiness living is in the scripture you don't need a revelation it's in the word hallelujah and we see the Day approaching we should forsake not the assembling of ourselves together whereas God could come down and touch us and change us and mold us hallelujah glory to God so you know so this now this is standing orders why do we let the devil run rampant in our thoughts why do we let him run rampant in our imagination and our reasoning or our conscious living under fear we are not called to live under fear we are not called to live under fear we are called to live under divine love hallelujah if people are motivated by fear you've got to fall in love with the Lord Jesus Christ amen we're motivated by love amen you know if someone came to me for example and see it about Christine you know she's mean and she's nasty and she's critical and she's you know it doesn't listen she did this the other day and she's like this I said hold on no no no no no I live with the woman I know what she's like she's not like anything you've just described because I'm in a relationship with her I'm married to her hallelujah but if I just heard about her and I was never married to her maybe I could say well maybe that was true but because I'm married to her any criticism my damn luck but I know her character I know what she's like right because I'm in a relationship hallelujah and they could say but I was there I seen I said no I don't believe what you're twisting that's not her because I know who heart right and it's the same thing with the Lord Jesus Christ same thing with his messenger people say is caught up in all kinds of crazy stuff and it now hold on hold on oh Jesus is this way no no hold on no no no no because I know him because I know the Lord because this is not just ink on paper no more it became a new book to me it became a personal book to me I didn't have to try and work out things and make it no one day I was reading Peter and it wasn't Peter to someone it was Peter to me in 2007 a personal book and all the way and the whole Bible became a new book to me why because I entered into a love relationship with the author of the book hallelujah and it's got to be the same thing with you I trust it is I mean when you have people come along and they say all kinds things to hold on no no no no I know the Lord I know his character I live with him I'm married to him hallelujah hallelu but we have the power where are we we have the authority to bind where am I well that's our bond on this shall be bound in heaven loose don't know she shall be loosed in heaven this power is given to you you know the devil the devil thinks he's gonna win yep the devil thinks he's gonna win somehow it's gonna he's going last-minute twist it some way and get the victory and he fights the word being fulfilled amen but the thing is you know he has to listen to your voice the devil has to back cup with a redeemed son or daughter when the weakest of Christians amen tell somewhere to go he's got to go amen who as I said who has who's on better speaking terms with God an archangel or or you a sinner saved by grace who's you know been redeemed you do hallelujah Satan's defeated we just got to live in victory he says here in Matthew 18 if you'll just try to think well that was just for Peter it's not just for Peter amen God's power hasn't diminished amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that you shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them see saying if to agree on anything that's a big anything is a lot of things if you thought about it I'm just I'm just trying to take things out of the Arsenal and put them before you Amy I'm just trying to show you this is what's in' this is what believers belief because believers are believers that's what we are we can't help but I'm sorry you know we believe the word right sure pieces of to agree on earth that's all we need to start agreeing with each other I mean that's why when prayer requests come out you say I agree I'm with you in this prayer I'm with you in this need not just mentally with something in your heart says yes I mean I'm gonna enter into your burden I'm gonna pray with you amen cuz he says the he says my father in heaven will do hallelujah amen so we have a right to bind the devil and to loosen we have the power amen he's like a he's like a trained dog what if he trained a dog well enough it will obey your voice doesn't matter how naughty the dog is if it's trained it'll obey your voice calling the devil a dog I am but maybe that's a discredit to a dog I think it is but you know you know but he has to obey your voice the devil has to obey you that's why we shouldn't put up ways on my case I'm in this fear I'm paralyzed by this thing we'll find out we need to find out what the cause of it is pray against it kick it out and move on hallelujah now I want to read this oh my brother I love this this is from here ye him but oh brother that was a small thing one day when Adams race they sent Moses the law God had seen the prophets and they refused and they had failed and when Adams race was backed up against the backboard of eternity and there they was standing there and doubt and fear and trembling and Satan's great army marching on sickness and ignorance the superstitions and things was taking them from from side to side there was one step down out and heaven screamed to the Angels I'm going down to the earth I'm going to save Adams race there you'll see it what will you do he came to earth he lived thirty three and a half years three and a half years he preached he looked over the earth till he found the very midst of the deepest dark fear of man and that was death he went to Golgotha plays every spear of death into his own heart there he died he sent back the Holy Spirit he said to his church take this and fight with it follow me you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall be witnesses of me in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth and these signs shall follow them that belief hello believers how are you these signs shall follow you I mean you got to put your faith into action hallelujah and my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents or drink deadly things if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover hallelujah the greatest weapon that was ever put in the hands of man as the Bible to be backed up with the Holy Ghost that Christ died at Calvary to free his church from superstitions and fear and doubt and trembling he lives today he rose from the dead he's alive tonight hear ye well Elise the greatest weapon is the Bible backed up by the Holy Ghost amen and that's why it's so incredible in this hour we don't just have the mechanics of the word but the dynamics comes down they need to make the word live holy that it manifests itself is not just us saying idle words God comes in behind I'm in a manifest his word hallelujah amen that's what fight amen he says take this and fight with it follow me hallelujah this Opio brother eyes are saying you're a preset message fight we're gonna fight friends we're here in a battle we know who wins we know we're going to win but let's let's let's push the campaign on hallelujah I wouldn't sit silent and let the devil rob you this is the same message say but the doctor told me I couldn't live but hear ye him the pastor excommunicated me said I'd be lost forever hear ye him say well brother BAM I haven't got it I don't know what what I will do if well the doctor said I couldn't live the hospital turned me out hear ye him I'm the Lord who heals all your diseases a little while in the world what do I hear a little while the world will see me no more yet you'll see me because I live you shall live also the world won't see me but you will and the things that I do the works that I do you'll do also I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world hear ye him he's the one that can save you he's the one that can heal you he's the one that's responsible for this amen he's the one who's responsible to his word if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me oh I preached from the pulpit wherever you are lift them up give them to the people hear ye him now I'd imagine when the trial come up this is from thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies now imagine when a trial come up what's the first thing a child of God has for a refuge when trials comes the greatest weapon those ever put in the hands of mankind is prayer now brother brems is the greatest weapon as a few things amen they all tie together hallelujah we've got to use them the greatest weapons ever put into hands of mankind is prayer it changes everything can we repeat that it changes if thing it even changed the mind of God one times he told his prophet to go up and tell the king he was going to die and the King turned his face the wall said lord I beseech you to consider me I have walked before you with a perfect heart I need 15 years longer and God spared his life fifteen years longer prayer changes things what does the devil try and stop us doing praying why cuz prayer changes things hallelujah amen now Jesus spake a parable about the unjust judge you spake a parable and theme to the scene this is why we should keep pressing in don't be discouraged don't just sit back and say well you know this is a problem with this day and age it's instant you know you sit around have a conversation some random fact comes up I don't know you google it you know this is but God isn't that way we read in the very beginning that the word brings forth fruit with patience right into that honest and good ground amen but you know it's an instant instant thing I mean I mean this world is instant many times with God is not instant that doesn't mean we should just quit you follow me we're gonna keep pressing on hallelujah see why are you saying these things we've got to keep an atmosphere of faith the right atmosphere around us because if God doesn't seem to answer straightaway and we say well maybe we didn't maybe he doesn't hear us or your doubt begins to come and what happens the atmosphere changes it changes from atmosphere of faith to doubt but we're called to only belief and he spake a parable on theme to the sin that men always ought to pray and not to faint saying the other deals in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary for he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet yet because of this widow trouble with me I will avenge her at least by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust sayeth and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry out day and night unto Him though he be along with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and the answer to that last part should be yes he shall curse Here I am and because he has put the faith the Son of God in my heart he will find faith upon the earth I mean best way you know when the devil's on our case and he says if this unjust judge would avenge the widow shall not God avenge us when a demon spirit comes it's sickness comes against us I mean mind battles comes against us trouble comes into the home shall not God avenge us shall not he deliver us shall not he cast the enemy out even if we crying to him day and night hallelujah yeah there's a big difference between praying and praying through a man you got to pray through sometimes it's short time sometimes it can be a long time I mean but I trust you know when you pray then that piece just comes down he has heard my petition the answer is on its way hallelujah and you have confidence lord I know you know the blood puts us back on speaking terms it puts us back on speaking terms with God the blood does hallelujah so we just go have conference father you hear my prayer hallelujah you know what I'm going through you're mindful of my situation amen so our God so we have to be like this amen the devil's on our case we go on his case now I want to read now this I want to read this let's struck me this week the resurrection of Jesus how do you do lady now this won't hurt you it's the Holy Spirit but such a wonderful anointing oh how dark it turns around this woman standing before me I see her moving in and some to her doctor's office Hospital but they keep shaking their head they don't know what's wrong with her that is right but he does know your main trouble is a nervous this is a nervous age this is a nervous age amen there's more people who are nervous now than there's ever been why cuz the nervous age it's a spasm like in the nerves it just causes you to feel horrible all the time they can't find it because it's a devil and the instruments won't show a spirit but he might have had from the x-ray but he can't hide from God looks right through him you believe obviously she says yes I do come here Oh Jehovah in the name of Jesus the Son of God your beloved doctors has tried to find them but he said but he can't hide from you come out of the woman thou evil spirit that's doing this thing in Jesus name rebuke thee and may she go on peace in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now many times we base our walk on how we feel amen there we okay many times I base how I will my walk on how I feel but it's the devil trying to rob us of our victory because the devil he can get into your flesh got into her nerves right he can get into our spirit realm what but he can't touch that soul I mean he cannot touch your soul if your soul is redeemed it's redeemed hallelujah how you feel in your spirit and your flesh does not change your Redemption Amen you're following me it does not change how your soul is if it's been birthed I mean you've been born again in your soul God's life is now in there I mean the devil can't take that from you he can't rob you of it I mean but sometimes we get sick or we have a spiritual trouble in our in a spiritual realm then we begin to say are we really believers do we really have the victory amen and our souls we have the victory we shouldn't be tossed to and fro by how we feel amen the devil takes our emotions and beats us around all day if we let them we feel down well I don't feel like praying well I don't feel like listening I don't feel like coming to church why cuz we're feel down and we pandering to our flesh and how we feel well I feel tired I tell you what if I came to church winner when I never felt tired I probably never be here I'll be real honest with you well we don't we shouldn't let these things rob us he's following me I mean we're gonna press in a mint but yeah we can feel like we're gonna take a rapture the next moment we're down crash bang and we think well what's happened to us it's the devil trying to rob you of your victory you've got to recognize it as such amen why am I feeling Moody while I feeling down let's boil it down Satan amen you got to kick him out hallelujah you say well does that you know because remember we're not gonna go in a rapture based on a feeling of euphoria we're not taking your body changed because we all feel some great euphoric feeling the modern church has taken music and it's built people up in such a way that they feel such a euphoric feeling in their services and people think that they're having they're actually having communion with God and God's changing them just based on that feeling in the music Amen but that is not faith brother Baron speaks against intellectualism and what and but he doesn't just speak about intellectualism isn't just in the mind he speaks out in two lectures I'm just in your spirit realm so people just go up on emotion only with no faith behind it that's intellectualism I mean any see how they beat on the drums they get all worked up and excited he says that's just intellectualism people working in a spirit realm trying to fake a religion that's not faith following me you see the prophets of bale they danced around the altar it's not working what do we do they begin to cut themselves well they trying to they're trying to bring out a physical feeling trying to try to stimulate the flesh by cutting themselves what happens with music in the modern church they're trying to stimulate the flesh by the music amen isn't that right but we don't go by that that's not faith it's intellectualism amen real faith is God revealing his word to you amen I don't I'm not going in a rapture cuz I'm going to feel it in my emotions let's go to Hebrews 11 let's just let's just read this and then I'm gonna read one more thing and then I'm gonna you make it hard to quit let's go to let's go to Hebrews 11 and we read from verse 33 sorry it's not up on the board so you go to Hebrews 11 so it's not there it's in there now I just want to just before we read this this is what I want to emphasize here notice the state of these people okay I want you to notice the state of these people just as I are you there say I mean when you are there in Hebrews 11 you can't talk about your neighbor or maybe if you're looking but you know Hebrews 11 and verse 33 who through faith this is the mighty faith chapter hallelujah who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens woman received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yah more bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder with tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth this is these are these are the people that the world is not worthy of it doesn't say they walked around with euphoria and we're rejoicing and everything was fine all the time and those had a glorious walk and nothing face them did we read that I didn't see that in there and so what we do is we have this idea it's gonna be some euphoric thing is going to come and nothing's going to bother us and but we're still human ah I think I'm pretty human so we still built the same way as everyone else but there's a seed in here that's been quickened by the word of the stage by the Holy Ghost and it's now come to life and it's living hallelujah bursting I got the same spirit realm the same same body as a any other man so the devil works in that realm to make us think we're not actually sealed into the kingdom in our soul you following me but that's what but I read that to say we not don't expect some euphoria sure there's moments of euphoria I'm not saying we should always be down and I'm told me to do them inflicted and you know it's not it's not always bad and that you know we should be following me I'm not trying to say we should be down and sad and armor I'm so glad I concern with you you know how's your walk pretty bad you know no it's wonderful it's glorious it's full of rejoicing hallelujah joy unspeakable full of glory we have those moments but the down moments do not take away what God has done right it doesn't rob us or take us away from what God has done a meant just because I feel down doesn't mean I don't believe anymore amen it doesn't mean my faith is gone no it's the devil trying to get me to think I don't believe or I have some kind of unbelief that's robbing me of the victory amen we got a we just got a walk-on but we're worried see your trouble is it's nervous and many times people went up in front of brother Brown and they had a nervous condition he never said they weren't Christians amen it's a nervous condition that got upon them and that's all they were was focusing upon that hey if you're if we put up with the devil what happens in the mind the devil pants a thought in your mind oh brother so-and-so do this will sister saw soda there's no what happens now you begin to be focused upon that and you become a prisoner to something that's probably not even real what's happening now you now focus upon that and now your emotions begin to manifest based on what you're thinking you know you think of a maybe I'll put a picture up you think of one of the most stressful days you've had you begin to think about long enough your body will begin to manifest itself because of the memory right or the greatest day you've had you're going to think about it long enough imagine your body will begin to matter if your emotions will manifest based on your memory right so the devil puts a thought in your mind your body will get the manifest based on their thought and we penned it to it we spend too much time maybe okay I spend too much time listening to the devil well you're looking at me like man who's this guy heat these up and he's brick you know why do we put up with his nonsense but that's why people get such a nervous condition because the devil comes in and yes we're gonna it's just a demon power trying to rob you of your health rob you of your joy robbed you of your peace I mean you gotta kick it out why do we live in fear oh this could happen well who says it could happen you know don't take a thought of tomorrow tomorrow take care of itself you know God's eyes on the sparrow I know he watches me and we're we're worth more than many sparrows and brother Brown tried to put a more of a you know add to that and say one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds that's more than many sparrows hallelujah we shouldn't be too worried easy for you to say no we shouldn't be worried what are we get worried about things put it at the foot of the cross and move on and the devil you know what the devil does he says oh you dropped this tries to give it back to you are you gonna say no I dropped that for a reason it's not mine my name is not on it Amen you may have made it for me you know yes I people you know how these like there's such a big thing about gifting you see on trade me after Christmas is all these read gifted Christmas presents oh but I got it for you the devil stuff but I got this for you he said no I don't want the gift I'm not signing for it but I thought of you when I made it yeah he did I put a lot of thought into this for you he did how do you I've been thoughtful it's not I'm not accepting it you got it we got to come to a place where we just say no Satan knew now I just finished with this you can go but you can change it to the other song thing now it's really I didn't put it up here now brother Bram he has a vision of of a of a Mamba snake he see and this is from this is just from a paradox in 61 he says then comes the Mamba he's deaf he's so fast who you can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and propels himself with the back of his towel just a swoosh and he's gone hits you in the face usually stands up high and strikes hard who seen a Mamba hopefully not in real life that'd be scary maybe some of you have but I just on YouTube or whatever man you should see them and when he hits you you've just got a few breaths till you're finished see to see don't only paralyze gets in the bloodstream it gets the nerves and everything you just die in a few seconds they're native boys and track boys eg say Mamba and they but the hissing it run scream that's death just in a few seconds see that's when one hits you and here he was on the high-waist now he's having a vision you know we're walking the highway it's a narrow way within the highway so now he's saying now here's this Mamba this devil on the highway right I thought well this is it so I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come and when he got real close to me he would run up fast and then he'd get slower and slow and just quiver and stop and then something would hold him off he wouldn't he couldn't bite me he would turn around on the other side try to approach from this side and he'd go back and get a start and swish right towards me get slower and slower and slower and then to a stop and when he would then he would shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me then he turned and looked at my friend and he went after my friend I see my friend just running way in the air and over him and over and over trying and the thing was striking out I thought oh if ever had some it'll be instant death no wonder everybody's so scared cause when this thing hits you it's instant death and it was just striking at him like that and I threw up my hands and said Oh God have mercy on my brother I said if that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him and just then the serpent turned to me and when I said that it looked at me again and a voice from above me said you have been given power to bind him the worst of any amen and I said well God what must I do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere I said well God forgive me for my own unseen serie T and let me have sincerity and when I raised up my hands again to meet him there was a great something come over me just lifted me up seemed like my whole body's was charged with something and I looked at the serpent and when he started towards me he couldn't do it yet and I see it Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up like a capital S backwards at your ensign and it means buying this one and anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke flew out of him and his tail choked choke his own self to death round his head and there was a backward S and and s is like conjunction as he choked her to death and the brother was free and it went over and I meshed on it and I'm asked on it I mean I said now I've got to find out about this because it's a vision and I had it and I had on the other thing it turned like this it looked like a handle like a glass handle of a picture just like solid crystal I said think of it how quick that blue smoke was life and everything I had left at all the elements and it turned to glass and then a voice said again you can unbind him also and I said then Satan that I might know I unbind you and when it did he started coming back to life again wriggling I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ and when it did the Chris the smoke flew out of him again and he choked them so I read that about you have the power to bind and to loose he says well you know but then when I always hit the bit where you've got to be more sincere I say the brightest sincere I mean I just say this this is just my little this is just me and fellowship now many times we read you have to be more sincere and we think now we have to get somewhere before we have it but brother Brown said help me forgive me my own sincerity make me more sincere and then he had the powder bind and loose so it's just a simple prayer Lord make me more sincere forgive me for my own sincerity I don't want to be on sincere I want to be more sincere that I can bind the devil the most powerful and the ones all underneath them I mean that my brother can go free I mean that this spirit will not affect anyone around me but it will be bound it will be ineffective will be disabled hallelujah we have that power we have that power to day hallelujah that power is in the Bride of Christ I mean we have the authority to bind the devil just like Moses you know you know I've seen it before Moses went in before Pharaoh Pharaoh his honest crown was a Cobra you go look at their crowns of Egypt and because he was considered a God and so now here comes he comes Moses with her stuff he throws it on the ground it turns into a snake he picks it up it turns into a stuff and he can do that as much as he wants binds and looses and Moses is telling Pharaoh he's actually telling the devil I have power to loose you I have the power to bind you I can loose you when I will I can bind you and I will you can't stop me you cannot stop me nothing you can do will stop me let my people go and that was God speaking through Moses and first person let my people go still got the power to bind and the powder loose and it's the same thing friends with you and I we have the power to bind the devil and the power to loose the devil whenever we will you just got to speak the word don't be afraid to speak the word talk to the Lord about it tell the devil to get out hallelujah amen whoa I've got to feel something no you got to believe it you got to go by what you believe because the devil always beats us down when you don't feel like enough faith and then you can't speak it well no I don't go by my feelings you know I've had times and I've prayed fella I'm gonna take a rapture but then I've had times when I've prayed I felt dead as a post and gods moved amen we had little Annelise little newborn she had she had a real bad tongue tie needed not just a snip in the front but a surgery round the round the round her tongue we just prayed I felt dead as a post Lord before the end and she's book done to go to the hospital to get it done I said Lord before the surgeon cuts her tongue may he not find a tongue tie what's their defect I thought did as apposed I wasn't on cloud nine and feel like I was gonna take rapture as we asked Christine takes her into the surgery going into the surgery she's a bit of blood in her mouth at the side surgeon looked opens her mouth looks of the tongue she sees no tongue die here and there was a tanked idea very strong tongue tie I felt did as apposed you say well but if I went by feelings well then what they mean we had you know and there's been many other instances like that it's not how you feel what do you believe asking faith not in feelings hate the feelings come with the faith just like love is a feeling they mean but it doesn't come the feelings don't come before the faith they mean so just take God at His Word you say well the devil's in my mind he's bombarding me with whatever more you've got to take the word yourself you've got to cast them out you got to tell them to get lost we have the power to do it well he's tormenting my family you take the word you take it well Graham says when a spirit filled man and I say all woman speaks the word across a word of God across their lips is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go nothing can stand before that man or before that woman nothing do you believe it I believe it I'm in this den shall we we had the musicians I heard a testimony this is I think over a year ago it happened brother Tim Pruitt's wife had a brain bleed real bad one rushed to hospital and she was just the emergency department that working on her the family coming it's you know it's looking pretty bad and he just says no yo yo he says his family no no we are made for times like this we are believers and believers believe and he just felt to say no this night should be in the ICU then she'll be in a regular hospital bed and then the third night she'll be at home that's exactly what happened Amen why do we limit God the same God is here amen what have you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven hallelujah I mean this thing that song do have that song on the projector in your presence that's where I'm strong in your presence amen Hedy Wright said the right thing she believed what the
