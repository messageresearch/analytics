[4:13] Bless you all. Welcome back to the house
[4:15] of the
[4:16] Lord. Let's just start off with delight
[4:19] yourself in the
[4:25] Lord. Oh, delight yourself in the
[4:31] Lord. the person at the center of our
[4:36] faith. Delight yourself and see him face
[4:41] to face. Still love yourself.
[4:48] You got this. So what I
[4:53] see from what the enemy tries to take
[4:57] from
[4:58] me, my will sing his praise.
[5:05] As I stand unshaken, steadfast in
[5:11] faith. But he is the open
[5:16] door to every praise I've never been
[5:22] before. And I delight myself in
[5:28] it.
[5:29] Delight yourself in it.
[5:34] Oh,
[5:35] delight yourself in
[5:40] Lord the person at the center of our
[5:45] faith. Delight yourself and see him face
[5:51] to face. Delight yourself.
[5:56] [Music]
[5:58] The god of how I
[6:03] feel. As hell breaks
[6:06] loose and sin
[6:09] reveal, my will sing his
[6:14] praise. And as our Lord descends at the
[6:19] end of
[6:22] day and he gives me
[6:27] everything and beyond all that I could
[6:30] ever
[6:33] dream and I delight myself in
[6:39] it.
[6:40] Delight yourself in it.
[6:45] For
[6:46] delight yourself in
[6:51] Lord, the person at the center of our
[6:56] faith and delight yourself and see him
[7:01] face to face. Oh,
[7:04] delight yourself in the Lord. Oh,
[7:08] delight.
[7:10] Still
[7:14] Joseph the person at the center of our
[7:20] face. Delight yourself and see him face
[7:25] to face. Delight yourself in Lord.
[7:32] [Music]
[7:33] As I divide myself
[7:38] in and every battle I fight, I'll win.
[7:45] As I delight myself in
[7:50] him, every battle I won. As I
[7:56] delight, as I delight myself in
[8:02] it, in every battle I fight, I'll
[8:07] win. As I delight myself in
[8:14] it, every battle I
[8:21] win. Oh,
[8:23] delight yourself in the Lord.
[8:29] person at the center of our
[8:34] faith and
[8:36] delight
[8:38] yourself and see him face to
[8:41] face.
[8:43] Delight yourself in the Lord.
[8:58] Some say I call on my
[9:03] imaginary
[9:05] [Music]
[9:08] friend. When I call upon you,
[9:14] Jesus, some call me weak because I say
[9:19] that I'm not
[9:20] [Music]
[9:24] strong. And all my strength comes from
[9:30] Jesus. But Jesus,
[9:33] I I won't be
[9:37] ashamed to take you by the
[9:41] head. To take you by the
[9:46] hand. No.
[9:50] I won't be
[9:52] ashamed to take you by the
[9:57] hand. To take you by the
[10:03] hand and lead me. You're much higher.
[10:08] Lead me. You're much wiser. Lead
[10:15] me. Wherever you'll take me, I'll
[10:21] go through the fire. I'll go through the
[10:27] valley. I know you know my way back
[10:33] home. And I know you will take me.
[10:39] We've all had days when life has brought
[10:43] us to our
[10:44] [Music]
[10:49] knees. But still we'll praise you
[10:54] Jesus and we conceive faith is telling
[10:59] us your will.
[11:02] [Music]
[11:05] That's why I will praise you,
[11:09] Jesus. But Jesus,
[11:13] I I won't be
[11:16] ashamed to take you by the
[11:20] hand. To take you by the hand.
[11:26] No,
[11:28] I won't be
[11:32] ashamed to take you by the
[11:36] hand. Take you by the
[11:41] land. Oh, lead me. You're my higher
[11:48] leading. You're much wiser. Lead me.
[11:53] [Music]
[11:55] Wherever you'll take me, I'll
[11:59] go through the fire. I'll go through the
[12:05] valley. I know you know my way back
[12:11] home. Not know you will take
[12:14] [Music]
[12:16] me. Cuz when the earth shake and
[12:20] roll, then the oceans cross their
[12:24] bounds. And all around, there's nothing
[12:28] left to hold
[12:31] to. And when the stars fall from the
[12:35] sky and the mountains flee
[12:39] away, your everlasting end will still
[12:44] remain.
[12:46] [Music]
[12:48] Lead me. You're my sire. Lead me. You're
[12:54] my wiser. Lead
[12:59] me. Wherever you'll take me. I'll
[13:05] go through the fire. I'll go through the
[13:10] valley. I know. You know my way back
[13:16] home. And I know you will take
[13:21] me.
[13:23] [Music]
[13:27] Oh. Amen. You can all have your seats.
[13:30] We've got a special from Stephanie. And
[13:34] yeah.
[13:56] When you're up against the
[13:59] wall and your mountain seems so tall and
[14:04] you
[14:06] realize life's not always
[14:11] fair. You can run away and
[14:15] hide. Let the old man
[14:19] decide. Or you can change your
[14:23] circumstances with a
[14:27] prayer. When everything falls
[14:32] apart, praise his
[14:35] name. When you have a broken heart, just
[14:40] raise your hands and
[14:43] say, "Lord, you're all I
[14:46] need. You're everything to me, and you
[14:52] take the pain away.
[14:56] [Music]
[14:59] When it seems you're all
[15:03] alone, praise his name. When you feel
[15:08] you can't go
[15:10] on, just raise your hands and
[15:14] say,
[15:15] "Gater is
[15:18] he that is within me."
[15:22] You can praise the hurt
[15:27] [Music]
[15:29] away if you just praise his name.
[15:34] [Music]
[15:39] Oh, you can
[15:42] overcome by the blood of the
[15:46] lamb and by the word of your
[15:53] testimony. You'll see the darkness
[15:57] go and your faith begins to
[16:01] grow. You're not alone. So, how can you
[16:06] be
[16:08] lonely when everything falls
[16:14] apart? Praise his name. When you have a
[16:19] broken heart, just raise your hands and
[16:24] say, "Lord, you're all I need. You're
[16:30] everything to me and you'll take the
[16:34] pain
[16:39] away. When it seems you're all
[16:44] alone, praise his name. When you feel
[16:48] you can go on, just raise your hands and
[16:55] say, gater is
[16:59] he that is within
[17:02] me. You can praise the hurt
[17:10] away if you just praise his name.
[17:17] [Music]
[17:21] [Applause]
[17:29] Amen. Don't we you believe that? Eh,
[17:32] let's just stand this evening and open
[17:34] up end with this song. There is none
[17:37] like you before brother Ben uh brother
[17:40] comes.
[17:50] [Music]
[17:52] There is none like you. There is none
[17:57] like you, my lord. No one else can touch
[18:03] my like you do.
[18:07] [Music]
[18:08] And I could search for all
[18:12] eternity
[18:13] long and find there is none like
[18:23] you. Cuz there is none like you. There
[18:29] is none like you my lord. No one else
[18:34] can touch my heart like you
[18:40] do. And I could search for all
[18:44] eternity
[18:46] long and
[18:49] find love by
[18:54] you. Cuz your
[18:56] mercy falls like
[19:00] guru
[19:03] heart and
[19:05] healing comes from your
[19:11] hand. The
[19:13] suffering
[19:14] children are asleep in your arms.
[19:21] There is none like
[19:26] [Music]
[19:28] you. There is none like you. There is
[19:34] none like you, my Lord. No one else can
[19:39] touch my heart like you
[19:44] do. And I could search for all
[19:49] eternity
[19:51] long and
[19:53] find there is none like you. There is
[19:58] none like
[20:01] you. There is none like you.
[20:10] No one else can touch my heart like you
[20:15] [Music]
[20:17] do. And I can search for all
[20:21] eternity,
[20:23] Lord. And
[20:25] find there is none like
[20:30] [Music]
[20:31] you. Cuz your mercy flows like
[20:38] river.
[20:40] heart and
[20:42] healing comes from your
[20:46] [Music]
[20:48] hand. Suffering
[20:52] children are safe in your
[20:57] arms. There is none like you.
[21:05] [Music]
[21:07] There is none like you. There's none
[21:12] like you, my Lord. No one else can touch
[21:17] my heart like you
[21:22] do. And I can search for all
[21:27] eternity
[21:28] long and
[21:30] find there is none like you. There is
[21:36] none like
[21:38] you. There is none like you. There's
[21:44] none like you, my love. No one else can

[21:55] do. And I can search for all
[22:00] eternity
[22:02] long and
[22:04] find there is none like
[22:11] you. Oh, God bless you all. It's good to
[22:14] be here and uh thank you, brother Bean,
[22:18] for inviting me to fellowship with you
[22:21] people. It's always nice to fellowship
[22:23] with fellow believers. It's nothing
[22:26] greater. And I don't know about you, but
[22:29] sometimes when you travel in countries
[22:31] like Saudi Arabia or places, it's such a
[22:36] tremendous thing if you meet a
[22:37] Christian.
[22:39] Amen. Just uh before we read the word,
[22:42] can we sing one more song just
[22:47] um into the chamber be free Holy Spirit.
[22:51] Have we got that
[23:02] one
[23:05] into the
[23:07] chamber be free
[23:11] Holy
[23:14] Spirit speak through me gently
[23:20] As I
[23:22] close the
[23:24] [Music]
[23:25] door,
[23:28] heavenly
[23:29] [Music]
[23:31] lover laid thy
[23:34] prison
[23:37] cover. She kind of
[23:43] unending is all I long for.
[23:50] Amen. You may be
[23:53] seated. I was uh preparing a little
[23:57] message here, but I want to share
[23:59] something from last Sunday first just to
[24:03] um make a start here. I just read a
[24:06] parable last Sunday and something really
[24:09] stood out to me. Matthew 25 from verse
[24:13] 14. It says here, "For the kingdom of
[24:16] heaven is as a man traveling into a far
[24:20] country, who called his own servants and
[24:24] delivered unto them his goods." And we
[24:26] know the parable, you know, and unto one
[24:29] he gave five talents or 5,000 gold
[24:33] coins, whatever people say, to another
[24:36] two, and to another one. And what really
[24:38] struck me was to every man according to
[24:43] his several
[24:47] ability and straightway took his
[24:49] journey. What what I want wanted to
[24:52] point out is you know the Lord gives you
[24:56] something and it's what he do with that
[24:59] something he gave you. It's not how much
[25:02] you have whether you stand behind a
[25:04] pulpit or behind the kitchen sink has
[25:07] nothing to do with it. It's what you do
[25:10] with what God has given you. And you
[25:13] know I said some people may have
[25:15] received
[25:18] like5. I cannot operate like that man
[25:21] because the man who gets five pounds is
[25:25] the man God
[25:27] trusted that much money. here with that
[25:30] much money and to the one he gave one he
[25:34] trusted him with the one and I believe I
[25:36] got one but what I want to do I want to
[25:39] invest it I don't want to bury it I want
[25:41] to use it and no matter what we have and
[25:45] I said that many times before but I used
[25:48] to go to conventions overseas and one
[25:51] thing struck me there was one man he
[25:53] traveled there every year from Italy he
[25:56] was about 90 years
[25:58] old every year he had the same
[26:02] verse. The blood of Jesus Christ
[26:05] cleanses from all sin. That's all he
[26:07] said. Every year. Every year. I think he
[26:10] invested that little bit God gave him.
[26:14] And it's it's wonderful when he could do
[26:16] that. I just wanted to start with that
[26:19] because it blessed me so much because
[26:21] sometimes we expect from people who have
[26:25] received one pound we expect them to
[26:27] operate like somebody who had five and
[26:30] vice versa. But the point is be true to
[26:34] what God has given you.
[26:37] Now what I want to uh talk about tonight
[26:40] is about the the word quickened. the
[26:43] quickening power.
[26:45] You all heard about it. You all know
[26:47] about it. But there's sometimes
[26:49] different angles which uh can be a
[26:52] blessing. In
[26:54] Psalm bless
[26:57] you. Thank you. In Psalm 119 verse 37 it
[27:04] says, "Turn away mine eyes from
[27:08] beholding
[27:09] vanity and quicken thou me in thy way."
[27:14] You see, turn away looking at the
[27:17] negative things. Turn my eyes away from
[27:20] the nonsense that's going on. You know,
[27:22] I I get a lot of texts and messages from
[27:27] people and YouTube clips and everything
[27:32] sent to me, but most of the time it's
[27:34] bad news. The nonsense that's going on.
[27:36] But turn my my eyes away from beholding
[27:40] vanity. It's all nonsense leads to
[27:42] nothing. But quicken thou me in thy way,
[27:46] Lord. What is thy way for my life? What
[27:48] is thy will? What should I do today? How
[27:52] can I
[27:52] invest my gift, my pound today? And uh
[27:58] quicken means to make alive, to revive
[28:01] or to stimulate. And I think it's very
[28:05] important that we realize there is a
[28:08] quickening power.
[28:11] You know, a quickening power
[28:13] is make the word alive. You know, we can
[28:18] have it. We can learn it. We can study
[28:20] it. We can believe it. But unless it's
[28:24] quickened,
[28:26] it's still it's like you have
[28:30] money and you have a look in in in a
[28:34] catalog of all the lovely things you can
[28:36] buy. Until you actually do the
[28:38] transaction, nothing happens.
[28:41] You have
[28:42] nothing. Even though we have the
[28:44] potential and when you have the word of
[28:46] God, we have the potential of almighty
[28:50] God quickening that word to us. And you
[28:54] know sometimes people read the Bible
[28:56] say, "Oh, I've read that before. I read
[28:58] that before." But if a word is
[29:00] quickened, it's power and and and life.
[29:03] Now in Ephesians 2:es 1-7, it says, "And
[29:08] you hath he quickened." You who were
[29:13] dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in
[29:16] time past you walked according to the
[29:19] course of this world, according to the
[29:22] prince of the power of the air, the
[29:24] spirit that now workketh in the children
[29:26] of disobedience, among whom also we all
[29:30] had our conversation in times past, in
[29:33] the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the
[29:36] desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[29:38] and were by nature the children of wroth
[29:41] even as others. But God who is rich in
[29:46] mercy for his great love where with he
[29:49] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[29:53] have quickened us together with Christ
[29:56] by grace he has saved and has raised us
[29:59] up together and made us sit together in
[30:02] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[30:06] the ages to come he might show the
[30:09] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[30:12] kindness towards us through Christ
[30:15] Jesus. You know, when God quickens
[30:17] something, it changes you because you
[30:21] it's like the light switched on. Like I
[30:23] said
[30:24] before, we can have the
[30:27] word. Somebody can have a revelation on
[30:30] the word and explain the revelation to
[30:33] you. But you need to have it yourself.
[30:36] See, a revelation cannot be learned.
[30:38] Yeah. And as long we say believe it and
[30:43] repeated and even
[30:46] teached, unless it's quickened, it
[30:49] doesn't make you alive. You see, we can
[30:53] talk about others who were made alive,
[30:55] but it has to be us. In John
[30:59] 6 63, here's another one. It is the
[31:04] spirit that
[31:05] quickenth. The flesh profitth nothing.
[31:09] The words that I speak unto you, they
[31:11] are spirit and they are alive. But it's
[31:14] got to be quickened. And
[31:17] uh words are meaningless unless they
[31:21] have a meaning that can be
[31:24] proven. What a statement. I can't
[31:27] remember where read it, but I printed it
[31:29] out. Words are meaningless unless they
[31:32] have a meaning that can be proven.
[31:36] Unless there is an outworking, something
[31:38] happening from
[31:40] it. I give you one or two others here.
[31:44] John
[31:45] 5:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[31:49] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[31:53] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[31:56] and shall not come into condemnation,
[31:58] but is passed from death unto
[32:01] life." And in John 8:43, he says, "Why
[32:05] do you not understand my speech even
[32:08] because he cannot hear my word?"
[32:11] See, hearing the word is one thing. We
[32:15] can hear it with a natural
[32:17] ear. A lot of people
[32:19] do. But some people can hear it inwardly
[32:24] because the word is quickened to them.
[32:26] They they know what he's saying. And
[32:29] that is what we want to aim for with
[32:32] every word of God. Not just what we
[32:34] know, but with every word of God. I want
[32:36] the word quicken to me. I want to have
[32:39] these experiences and and uh how can you
[32:43] say it? I want to see it made alive
[32:46] within me. You know, I want to see the
[32:48] word made alive. Now, the word quickened
[32:53] by the Holy Spirit will make the
[32:55] difference. That makes a difference. As
[32:58] you may know, I'm traveling south at the
[33:01] moment going to Invoc. But I was
[33:04] reminded of my last trip when I went to
[33:08] invoc. I started to feel a bit unwell on
[33:12] the on the way. I had very bad pains in
[33:16] my abdomen and um it got worse. Then I
[33:21] was there in a house where I stayed and
[33:26] um I prayed I prayed for healing. Uh
[33:31] rang Bronman. He said, "Go and see a
[33:33] doctor." I said, "I don't want to." So,
[33:35] it started to get worse and then I
[33:37] started to feel and one place was very
[33:41] painful and I had a great big lump
[33:43] underneath, you know, and uh it was for
[33:46] quite a few days. But then one morning I
[33:50] was by myself there
[33:53] uh either was before or after breakfast.
[33:56] I thought about the Lord and something
[33:59] quickened to me.
[34:01] quickened suddenly out of nowhere. God
[34:05] loves me. God loves me. He cares for me.
[34:09] I prayed. I was instantly healed
[34:12] instantly because it was quickened.
[34:16] But you know, I knew God is love. God
[34:19] loves me. He died for my sin. All all
[34:21] these things. But it when it's
[34:24] quickened, it becomes alive. And then
[34:27] things start to happen. We don't need a
[34:30] new word. We need the existing word
[34:32] quickened. That's all we need. And
[34:34] sometimes people f try to find more
[34:38] things and deeper things or whatever
[34:41] things because the simple word has not
[34:44] been quickened. Well, if it's quickened
[34:47] to you that you're a son of the almighty
[34:49] God or a daughter, well, what greater
[34:52] things can there be? Amen. My very first
[34:56] experience as a young
[34:58] Christian, I have to remind you, I was
[35:01] in a church where they didn't really
[35:02] promote divine healing. Speaking of
[35:05] tongues was of the devil and you know
[35:07] that kind of thing. But nevertheless,
[35:10] everything happened to me. I experienced
[35:12] divine healing and speaking in tongues
[35:14] without uh the blessings of the church,
[35:18] so to speak. But what happened? I I was
[35:20] at home and I needed an operation in my
[35:24] foot and I was going through through the
[35:26] diary when when is a convenient time to
[35:29] go to the hospital 3
[35:33] weeks and then suddenly it quick was
[35:37] quicker to me. God is your heavenly
[35:39] father. I prayed every day. Our father
[35:42] which art in heaven hallowed be thy
[35:44] name. I prayed that every day but then
[35:47] it was quicker. He is really my father.
[35:51] Wow. I can ask him anything.
[35:55] If I ask him for bread, would he give me
[35:56] a stone? Yeah. You know that kind. And I
[36:00] was so happy. It was quickened to me
[36:02] that he was my heavenly father. I
[36:05] believed it all my life and prayed it.
[36:07] But then it was quickened to me. I
[36:08] prayed it was I was healed completely.
[36:12] The word quickened will make a
[36:14] difference. It brings a manifestation of
[36:17] the
[36:19] word. So we believe that all have sinned
[36:22] and fall short of the glory of God. This
[36:25] truth must also be quickened first. Then
[36:29] part two of the verse says must be will
[36:34] be quickened as well sooner or later
[36:35] which says even the righteousness of God
[36:38] which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
[36:42] all and upon all them that believe. For
[36:46] there's no difference. For all have
[36:48] sinned and come short of the glory of
[36:51] God, being justified
[36:54] freely by his grace through the
[36:57] redemption that is in Christ
[37:00] Jesus. It's very easy to to feel
[37:03] condemned. Yeah, we're all sinners and
[37:06] and and all that, but it also has to be
[37:08] quickened that we justified freely,
[37:12] completely forgiven. Notice forgiven,
[37:15] forgotten, justified. And uh there
[37:21] is so this why the
[37:25] first the first
[37:27] um revelation so to call it the first
[37:30] things that quickens quickened to me. Uh
[37:35] it started when the the Lord started to
[37:37] draw me. Somebody prayed for me and
[37:40] suddenly I realized how low I've come in
[37:43] my
[37:44] life. I didn't see it until it was shown
[37:48] to me and it was quickened to me the
[37:51] fact that I have come so
[37:54] low. You know that was the first thing.
[37:59] Then I knew I was a sinner and I had no
[38:03] doubt about that. So that was the first
[38:05] thing and then someone gave me a
[38:10] Bible and then the Holy Spirit started
[38:12] to convict
[38:14] me.
[38:15] Well, we have to come through the right
[38:19] channel. We have to have godly
[38:21] conviction and repentance. Otherwise, we
[38:24] never have the other steps right. If we
[38:27] want the word
[38:29] quickened, all the blessings and all the
[38:32] good things, we need to come through the
[38:34] right channel. So the first
[38:38] uh word that was quicker to me was that
[38:40] I was a sinner. When I read the
[38:44] Bible, I started to read. Well, I will
[38:47] read through the New Testament, but one
[38:50] thing uh that really struck me, and I'd
[38:53] just like to to read that Matthew
[38:57] 18:6, it says, "But who so shall offend
[39:02] one of these little ones which believe
[39:05] in me? It were better for him that a
[39:07] millstone were hanged about his neck,
[39:11] and that he were drowned in the depth of
[39:14] the sea.
[39:16] Well, I tell you what, I was so
[39:19] convicted. I felt so spoken to because I
[39:25] had a friend. He was, you can say a big
[39:29] green or or whatever you call it. And I
[39:31] tried to help him to get on in the
[39:34] world. They showed him a big wide world.
[39:36] It was me who gave him the first
[39:38] cigarette. It was me who caused him to
[39:40] drink alcohol first. It was me who
[39:43] caused him to do all sorts of things.
[39:45] And then I felt so convicted when I read
[39:49] that he was an innocent child and here
[39:54] am I to mislead a person like that. What
[39:58] can you do when you convicted? You tried
[40:00] to do something. Well, I bought a Bible
[40:04] and uh I gave him a Bible and said,
[40:06] "Forget everything I said. I ever said
[40:09] that's the truth and everything I said
[40:11] was not true." and he thought I've gone
[40:14] nuts at the time. But you see
[40:18] that made a different a
[40:21] conviction. The word quicken you're a
[40:24] sinner caused me trying to to put things
[40:27] right. So I was on the right track in
[40:30] that sense. And then the the glorious
[40:34] thing that happened in my life was
[40:38] um quite a bit later. Yeah. Many things
[40:41] happened but Acts
[40:43] 26:12-18 I like to read that because
[40:47] it's it's really what changed my life
[40:51] completely here Paul speaking where upon
[40:54] as I went to Damascus with authority and
[40:57] commission from the chief priests at
[41:00] midday oh king I saw in the way a light
[41:04] from heaven above the brightness of the
[41:06] sun shining round about me and them
[41:10] which journeyed with me. And when we
[41:13] were all fallen to the earth, I heard a
[41:15] voice speaking unto me and saying in the
[41:18] Hebrew tongue, soul, soul, why
[41:21] persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee
[41:24] to kick against the pricks. And I said,
[41:28] who art thou, Lord? And he said, I'm
[41:31] Jesus, whom thou
[41:33] persecutest? I just want to stop there
[41:35] for a moment. You know, Paul the
[41:38] Apostle, he had the word, the Old
[41:42] Testament scriptures, the Torah, and
[41:44] whatever they call it, and the the law
[41:47] of Moses and all these things, and he
[41:49] was
[41:51] zealous. He studied it. He believed it.
[41:56] He was
[41:57] zealous, but he was walking in error. He
[42:01] was walking in blindness, unawares until
[42:04] the great lie came. And you know when
[42:06] the great lie comes, it shines light up
[42:10] on everything. Where we were wrong,
[42:13] where we were going the wrong way, he
[42:16] shines light on upon his word and we
[42:19] suddenly see it the way it is. But until
[42:23] then, he was just working against God,
[42:28] thinking he works for God. See, that's
[42:32] that's his experience. And I believe we
[42:36] all need a similar experience. I think
[42:38] we all need that. And then he says here,
[42:43] "But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I
[42:47] have appeared unto thee for this
[42:49] purpose, to make thee a minister and
[42:51] witness both of these things which thou
[42:54] hast seen and those things in the which
[42:57] I will appear unto thee." You know, he
[43:00] didn't give him that the entire plan. He
[43:02] said, "I will appear unto you,
[43:05] delivering thee from the people and from
[43:07] the
[43:08] Gentiles, unto whom now I sent
[43:12] thee." And here it comes, verse 18. The
[43:17] purpose was to open their
[43:19] eyes. How can he open their eyes? is
[43:22] preaching the word, the anointed word,
[43:25] and then the Lord can quicken that word
[43:28] and to turn them from darkness to light
[43:31] and from the power of Satan unto God,
[43:35] that they may receive forgiveness of
[43:39] sins and inheritance among them which
[43:43] are sanctified by faith that is in me.
[43:47] Now I have to to say I read this in in a
[43:52] a different translation just this
[43:55] verse. You will make them able to
[43:58] understand the
[44:00] truth. They will turn away from darkness
[44:03] to the light. They will turn away from
[44:06] the power of Satan and they will turn to
[44:09] God.
[44:10] then their sins can be
[44:14] forgiven and they can be given a place
[44:17] among God's people, those who have been
[44:20] made holy by believing in
[44:23] me. And that really hit home. It was
[44:27] quickened to me. Yes, I believed in
[44:29] Jesus. I believed in him. I tried to
[44:33] change my entire life. It was quickened
[44:36] to me that by believing in
[44:40] Jesus, I was given a place amongst God's
[44:44] people, sanctified, made holy, part of
[44:48] God's kingdom. You know, that was
[44:51] quickened to me and that changed my
[44:55] entire
[44:56] life. You know, I was very reformed by
[45:01] then and very religious actually.
[45:05] But that was complete
[45:07] deliverance. One word quickened from the
[45:10] Lord to you, it will make a difference.
[45:13] It will make the entire difference. And
[45:15] as I said, sometimes we seek more of
[45:18] God. We seek more.
[45:21] And we already have it. We just need to
[45:24] have it quickened to us. You know, I
[45:28] don't know how to put that across,
[45:30] but it's not some we need no other word.
[45:33] We have the word but it has to be
[45:36] quickened and then it will do something
[45:39] in our lives. I read you another one
[45:42] here in in
[45:43] Colossians chapter 2 vers 13-
[45:48] 15. And you being dead in your sins and
[45:53] the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he
[45:56] quickened together with him? Having
[45:59] forgiven you all
[46:03] trespasses or that if you ever feel
[46:06] guilty, if you have a guilt thing, you
[46:09] know, some people carry that half their
[46:12] lives or all their lives, they feel
[46:13] guilty and then they try to please God.
[46:17] They're they're probably the most
[46:19] faithful churchgoers because they feel
[46:22] guilty and you know some churches like
[46:25] you to stay that way. So you you're
[46:29] under you controlled you
[46:33] know but if it's quickened to
[46:36] you having forgiven you all
[46:41] trespasses for a star believe this word
[46:44] and then how do how do you seal the
[46:47] deal? Well if it's quickened to you you
[46:50] see it and you jump and screaming for
[46:53] for for joy. But if you don't see it and
[46:57] you want that word quickened, you can
[46:59] pray, "Lord, grant me the spirit of
[47:02] revelation, the spirit of wisdom."
[47:08] And I encourage uh people all the time
[47:11] to pray daily for the spirit of wisdom
[47:13] and
[47:15] revelation. And you can also pray for a
[47:18] spirit of discernment and the spirit of
[47:20] of the gifts, you know. But when that is
[47:25] quickened to
[47:26] you, how can you have a quickened? Well,
[47:30] here it says, "Has he quickened together
[47:33] with him, having forgiven you all
[47:37] trespasses?" Well, number one, if you
[47:40] believe that, say, "Thank you, Lord,
[47:42] that you forgive me all my trespasses."
[47:44] Amen.
[47:46] If it's old, that means I have none
[47:48] left. Amen. Then I'm free from sin. I'm
[47:51] sinless. You see that has to be
[47:54] quickened. But to in order to get these
[47:57] things quickened to you is giving thanks
[48:00] for it. You know in the book of Romans
[48:03] where it says
[48:05] um we we are um
[48:09] justified, sanctified, glorified.
[48:14] Well, I believe that. But if you say,
[48:16] "Thank you, Lord, that you made me holy.
[48:20] Thank you, Lord, that you justified me,
[48:22] that you forgive me all my sins. You
[48:23] don't remember any of them, even the
[48:26] ones of today. I commit them all under
[48:29] the blood of Christ. You see, by giving
[48:32] thanks, you actually starting in the
[48:35] right direction. And then when God
[48:38] quickens their truth to you, it makes
[48:40] all the difference in your life. All the
[48:43] difference. And you know, we can walk
[48:44] with the Lord for years and years and
[48:47] years and yet still the words they have
[48:50] to be quickened, made alive. Like I
[48:53] said, God loves me. I know that. I sang
[48:56] that in Sunday school. You know, Jesus
[48:59] loves me. This I know. But then it was
[49:02] quickened. Yeah. And the result was his
[49:06] great love came on me, the Holy Spirit.
[49:09] And you know the Satan cannot stay where
[49:12] the Holy Spirit is and I was healed
[49:14] instantly. You know I mean it's it's
[49:17] tremendous. It's tremendous. And it's
[49:20] all the quickening power of God. And
[49:23] then it says for verse 14, blot blotting
[49:26] out the handwriting of ordinances that
[49:29] was against us which was contrary to us
[49:33] and took it out of the way nailing it to
[49:36] the cross and having spoiled
[49:38] principalities and powers he made a show
[49:40] of them triumphing over
[49:44] them. The word is always the
[49:48] truth and it's there for us.
[49:52] What do we have to for a start? We have
[49:55] to read it, believe it, and then say,
[49:59] "Lord, make it real to me." Every word.
[50:02] Every word. I found myself in the past,
[50:05] you know, reading through the New
[50:06] Testament several times, several times,
[50:08] and then you come across the um story
[50:11] how he fed the 5,000 and the how he fed
[50:14] the 3,000, you know, and it repeats in
[50:16] some other gospels. and and one day I
[50:19] thought, "Oh, read it so many times and
[50:21] skip through it." But then I thought,
[50:23] "No, I don't want to skip through it."
[50:25] And the Lord quickened to me some other
[50:28] things in it by stopping and praying and
[50:32] and
[50:34] uh it it was just opened up completely
[50:38] differently. I mean, if you read that
[50:40] story, I just want to mention it. What
[50:42] what happened? They needed food. There
[50:45] was not enough food and Jesus took care
[50:48] of it. First thing he did, he put them
[50:50] into groups of 50 and 100 and made them
[50:54] sit down in the
[50:55] grass. He put an order to it, you know,
[50:59] an order. And people had to submit to
[51:03] that order without seeing the bread and
[51:06] the fish. It wasn't there. But they had
[51:08] to believe him enough to sit there
[51:12] hoping for something they couldn't see.
[51:15] And they did. And then you could Can you
[51:19] imagine here they hand out fish and
[51:22] bread and the one in group number 50
[51:24] there somewhere? Well, will it come my
[51:27] way? You know, it run out. No, it never
[51:29] ran out. You see, we just stay there and
[51:33] trust the
[51:35] Lord until it happens. you know, never
[51:38] skip a word. I came across, you
[51:42] know, if if you want
[51:45] to see the splinter in your brother's
[51:48] eye, you know, uh uh take the log out of
[51:50] your own or whatever. And and I thought,
[51:52] ah, I have no problem with that. You
[51:54] know, I don't see any fault in people.
[51:58] And I wanted to skip it, but then I
[52:00] thought, well, Lord, if I have a log in
[52:03] my eyes, I wouldn't even see it. So I
[52:05] prayed if there's anything take it away.
[52:07] You know I mean every word has so much
[52:10] in it. See we want to
[52:14] uh you see the leadership of the Holy
[52:16] Spirit continues. You know I'm I'm just
[52:22] about No, I have got another
[52:24] page. Have I still got time? Yeah. I I
[52:28] just like to read you one or two things.
[52:31] Um about the leadership of the Holy
[52:33] Spirit. It
[52:37] continues in in in my life, you know,
[52:41] when I uh had
[52:44] my quickening experience when I received
[52:47] the Holy
[52:49] Ghost. I
[52:51] um I was 27 years old and I traveled the
[52:56] world and did all sorts of things and I
[52:58] felt like settling down and getting
[53:01] married and having a family and people
[53:03] tried to push me or encourage me and
[53:05] it's a natural desire but what
[53:09] happened the Lord said no
[53:13] wait and he said five
[53:16] years well I'm well I'm 27
[53:20] you know, I'm going to be an old man.
[53:22] You know, 32 is an old man, I thought.
[53:24] But no, it's it's uh and then, okay,
[53:27] what what would I do then if I oh, go to
[53:31] Bible school and I was turned down. That
[53:34] was hurtful in a way, but I got over
[53:36] that. Yeah, I wanted to be missionary
[53:38] and all these things. And then I
[53:39] thought, well, after all these church
[53:42] disappointments, I do it on my own. I
[53:45] don't need the church to to to to uh you
[53:49] know uh sent me or pay me or whatever. I
[53:53] said I I thought the Lord's with me
[53:56] anyway. So I took off on my own and I
[53:59] can honestly say the Lord's been with me
[54:02] all along. All
[54:04] along. I didn't need to to serve a
[54:07] denomination. I I didn't need that. He
[54:10] actually delivered me out of it.
[54:12] So things came the church
[54:15] disappointments and then on one business
[54:18] trip what happened I I first time in my
[54:21] life I heard about William Brandham and
[54:24] then uh ended up you know I cut it a bit
[54:27] short to
[54:29] to listen to messages and was greatly
[54:32] blessed and drawn closer to
[54:35] God. But then I was also meeting with
[54:38] confusion. I was meeting with religious
[54:42] spirits, but praise God, I'm still
[54:45] hearing the same voice that caught me in
[54:48] the first place. You know, that's one
[54:49] thing pe people uh don't realize. When
[54:53] God draws you, when the Lord draws you,
[54:56] you hear his voice. Where are you when
[54:59] you hear his voice? Still in the
[55:00] wilderness, still in the world, that's
[55:03] when you first hear him. come out of it,
[55:05] you know, and follow the same voice.
[55:09] Follow the same voice. Later on when you
[55:12] when you become a Christian and you you
[55:15] exposed to different churches and
[55:17] beliefs and things, there's lots of
[55:22] voices, but it's still the same one that
[55:24] drew you out in the first place that
[55:26] called you is the one to listen to. So I
[55:30] I went through all these different
[55:32] things but I still hearing the same
[55:35] voice of God. You see the Holy Spirit is
[55:41] gentle. It castes out all
[55:44] fear. I've been corned in the
[55:48] past say by zealous religious people. Do
[55:52] you believe this? Do you believe that?
[55:53] Could you do this and unless you believe
[55:56] this you're not the bride and unless
[55:58] this and you you want you know and
[56:03] then I was
[56:05] forceful and then a spirit of fear can
[56:08] come up can come up on you think oh
[56:11] maybe I don't see it right or maybe this
[56:13] look where the love of God castes out
[56:17] all fear where the spirit of God is
[56:19] there's liberty and then I started to
[56:22] realize that's not of God so I could lay
[56:25] it aside. So I, as I said, I was praying
[56:29] daily for discernment, wisdom, and
[56:31] revelation. I still
[56:33] do. And it's a wonderful thing. If you
[56:36] think you're wise enough, then you
[56:38] definitely need to pray for wisdom.
[56:41] And we cannot have enough revelation.
[56:44] But it needs to come from God. It needs
[56:46] to be quickened to you. Lord, quicken
[56:48] your word to me. And when you're in that
[56:51] presence, everything changes. Now, he
[56:54] will lead us right to the end. He will
[56:57] quicken this mortal body whether we are
[56:59] dead or alive. You know, that's I don't
[57:02] want
[57:03] to say anything controversial, but you
[57:06] know, sometimes people say you you need
[57:08] to see this, you need to believe that,
[57:10] and you need need to get that quickening
[57:13] power to change and to make it in the
[57:16] rapture. You need to learn this and that
[57:17] and that. What about if I die tonight?
[57:20] Or what about if you die
[57:22] tonight? He will quicken this mortal
[57:25] body. It's nothing to do with us. It's
[57:28] not how much we know. It's knowing him
[57:31] and he will quicken this mortal body.
[57:33] The same spirit that dwelt in Christ
[57:36] Jesus dwelleth in you. He will quicken
[57:38] this mortal body. It's a matter of
[57:40] having the Holy Ghost. It's not a matter
[57:42] of knowing things or learning things.
[57:44] It's a matter of having the Holy Ghost.
[57:46] And you know, preaching the Holy Ghost
[57:50] is is hard on people sometimes because,
[57:53] oh, have I really got this or haven't I?
[57:56] It's it's
[57:57] easier to learn a religion. It's easier
[58:01] to agree with certain things. It's
[58:04] easier to have a walk like
[58:08] that than being led by the Holy Spirit
[58:11] and subject to him. But you know it's
[58:14] the most important thing is that we
[58:16] filled with the Holy
[58:17] Ghost. Then the quickening power is
[58:20] within us.
[58:22] Nothing can go wrong. That power is
[58:24] within you. Greater is he that's within
[58:27] you than he that is in a world. That
[58:29] quickening power in you, it will quicken
[58:32] his mortal body. It will also quicken
[58:34] his living body when the Lord
[58:37] comes. You know, one glimpse of
[58:39] him makes such a difference. Uh, I'll
[58:42] never forget an experience I had way way
[58:45] back in
[58:46] 1984. I was in Australia in Townsville
[58:51] actually and I was walking down the
[58:55] street and suddenly I felt I looked up,
[58:58] I saw the clouds and I was reminded the
[59:02] Lord could come today. He could come. He
[59:05] comes with the clouds and it could
[59:09] happen any any moment. It could. I
[59:13] rejoiced so much walking down that main
[59:16] street. People turned their heads and
[59:18] looked at me. I don't know what I did or
[59:21] how I looked, but I was leaping for joy
[59:25] just knowing. But you see, right to that
[59:30] moment, I felt quite dry. I didn't feel
[59:34] like rejoicing. I didn't feel like Yes.
[59:38] Somebody says the Lord's coming soon.
[59:40] Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah, praise God.
[59:42] He's coming soon and and all these
[59:44] things, but I haven't had that
[59:47] excitement. And sometimes when you don't
[59:49] have that excitement, you feel almost
[59:52] guilty. But you know, he quickens the
[59:55] truth to you. Just one glimpse of him,
[59:59] it changes everything. Everything. So
[1:00:03] never feel discouraged when you don't
[1:00:05] feel excited.
[1:00:08] He he'll excite you, right? 1
[1:00:12] Corinthians
[1:00:13] 15 from verses 51-52 he says, "And
[1:00:17] behold, I show you a
[1:00:19] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[1:00:23] shall be all be changed in a moment, in
[1:00:27] a twinkling of an eye, at the last
[1:00:30] trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and
[1:00:32] the dead shall be raised
[1:00:34] incorruptible, and we shall be
[1:00:37] changed. Well, what makes us being
[1:00:42] changed is the quickening
[1:00:45] power. And if that Holy Spirit is within
[1:00:49] us, we have that quickening power within
[1:00:52] us. And it's he that quickens this
[1:00:54] mortal body. I I really love that. So
[1:00:56] it's not how much I run, how much I do,
[1:01:00] it's how much I of him I have in me have
[1:01:03] the Holy Ghost and you sealed by the
[1:01:06] Holy Ghost until the day of redemption.
[1:01:09] So don't you ever despair. John
[1:01:13] 5:21, for as the Father raises up the
[1:01:17] dead and quickenth them, even so the Son
[1:01:21] quickenth whom he will. You see, it is
[1:01:25] him who raises the dead and quickens
[1:01:28] them. You see, it's it's not us doing
[1:01:33] it. You know, if if you know people who
[1:01:35] know a lot of things, the moment they
[1:01:38] die, they don't know much. I'm I knew a
[1:01:40] man well said this way, he was an
[1:01:45] inventor over in Switzerland. He had an
[1:01:48] engineering business and they they uh
[1:01:52] made lathes and things and it's it's a
[1:01:55] very uh worldwide known business and he
[1:02:00] invented what was called a cent
[1:02:03] centrifix you know this I don't want to
[1:02:05] explain it it doesn't matter an
[1:02:07] engineering tool and he was the
[1:02:10] inventor very clever man I met him years
[1:02:14] later at a race home
[1:02:18] Well, he was s such a happy man, but he
[1:02:21] didn't know where he was and what
[1:02:23] happened and who who he was. He was
[1:02:26] totally gone
[1:02:28] mentally, but he was a
[1:02:31] Christian. So that quickening power is
[1:02:33] still there. And the Lord still quickens
[1:02:35] that body. Whether he's
[1:02:38] mentally passed or not has nothing to do
[1:02:41] with it. He received Christ when he was
[1:02:44] younger. That's made all the difference.
[1:02:46] So it's the father that raises up the
[1:02:49] dead and quickness them even so the son
[1:02:51] quickness whom he will. I know it's it's
[1:02:54] simple scriptures you may know have
[1:02:56] learned them or known them for years and
[1:02:59] years but to me that's where life is
[1:03:02] when it's quickened it becomes alive.
[1:03:06] you know, even I don't know if you know
[1:03:07] that, but
[1:03:10] um when when a woman uh has a baby or
[1:03:14] gets
[1:03:15] pregnant, and I didn't know that until
[1:03:18] the midwife said, "Oh, Bron said, oh, I'
[1:03:22] I've felt the baby." So, no, it's
[1:03:24] quickened. She said, "It's quickened."
[1:03:26] That's a term they use. It has become
[1:03:29] alive. And you know every word of God if
[1:03:32] it becomes alive it makes such a huge
[1:03:35] difference.
[1:03:37] It's there dormant. You know
[1:03:40] I I collected some seeds
[1:03:44] from my last uh planting in the garden.
[1:03:48] You know I've got a bag full of cucumber
[1:03:51] seeds, a bag full of pumpkin seeds of
[1:03:54] you know I've got five bags full of
[1:03:56] seeds from those plants.
[1:03:58] There's life in there,
[1:04:01] but nothing happens until that life is
[1:04:05] quickened by water, by the by light, you
[1:04:09] know, it has to be quick. Then it grows
[1:04:11] into something. But just to have
[1:04:15] this, it's potential life, but we want
[1:04:18] to see the life and then we want to see
[1:04:20] the fruit as well.
[1:04:23] Romans
[1:04:25] 8:28-32. We all know these scriptures,
[1:04:27] but I I'm just uh I love it so much
[1:04:31] these ones. And we
[1:04:33] know that all things work together for
[1:04:37] good to them that love God, to them that
[1:04:40] are the called according to his purpose.
[1:04:44] And when things don't go
[1:04:46] right, remember I'm called according to
[1:04:50] his purpose. I'm cold. He's given me one
[1:04:54] pound. Don't expect me to to to to
[1:04:58] invest five if I have only one, but I
[1:05:01] want to invest what I've got. You say
[1:05:04] called according to his
[1:05:06] purpose. Things can go wrong. And we can
[1:05:09] meditate upon the wrong. And no, I'm
[1:05:12] called according to his purpose. So
[1:05:14] these things work together for my good.
[1:05:17] I might learn something.
[1:05:19] Some of you who who know me um may know
[1:05:23] when I was younger I wanted to be more
[1:05:25] holy. I lived four and a half months in
[1:05:26] a bush. Nearly died out there. Didn't
[1:05:29] get more holy, you know, just just uh
[1:05:34] but I thought I could have
[1:05:38] uh spared
[1:05:40] myself that four and a half months in
[1:05:43] the
[1:05:44] bush. And now I think no, I needed that.
[1:05:48] It helped me to come to what I am now.
[1:05:51] You see, all things work together for
[1:05:53] good. Even if we seem to take the wrong
[1:05:56] turn somewhere, it will lead you to the
[1:05:58] right place eventually. And then he
[1:06:02] says, for whom he did
[1:06:06] forno. So we were in the fornowledge of
[1:06:09] God. He did also
[1:06:12] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:06:14] image of his son that he might be the
[1:06:17] firstborn among many brethren. So if he
[1:06:20] were fornown of God and predestinated of
[1:06:24] God, what does it say? Moreover, whom he
[1:06:27] did
[1:06:29] predestinate them he also
[1:06:32] called. And I think why are we in
[1:06:35] church? Because we all have been called.
[1:06:37] Yeah. We heard something inside that
[1:06:40] drew us to the Lord.
[1:06:43] So that makes
[1:06:46] me a
[1:06:49] um being fallen and predestinated
[1:06:52] because he called me. I know he called
[1:06:54] me. So those he predestinated them he
[1:06:58] also called. And whom he called them he
[1:07:02] also
[1:07:03] justified. He justifies. It's not me. He
[1:07:09] justified and whom he justified them, he
[1:07:12] also
[1:07:15] glorified. What shall we say to these
[1:07:18] things? What should we say to these
[1:07:20] things? If God be before us, who can be
[1:07:24] against us?
[1:07:26] He that spared not his own son but
[1:07:29] delivered him up for us all, how shall
[1:07:32] he not with him also freely give us all
[1:07:34] things?
[1:07:36] You know, you know, we sometimes
[1:07:39] underestimate
[1:07:40] God. No, all things are possible. Even
[1:07:45] the most impossible situations, God can
[1:07:48] make a way. Absolutely 100%.
[1:07:52] You know, I've seen people people in
[1:07:54] despair know it's finished. In the
[1:07:56] finish, we had somebody a while ago saw
[1:08:00] this in despair. Oh, I'm finished. I'm
[1:08:03] not coming to church anymore.
[1:08:05] And it lasted two
[1:08:08] days. But you see, we can get despared.
[1:08:12] We can get attacked. We can look what we
[1:08:16] read at the beginning to the to the
[1:08:19] vanities of this life and the bad things
[1:08:23] and let us oh look I I'll read that
[1:08:26] verse first one again in the psalm turn
[1:08:29] away my eyes from beholding vanity what
[1:08:32] does it do it puts you down and makes
[1:08:34] you miserable makes you self- condemned
[1:08:37] and all these things it's all vanity of
[1:08:39] life all nonsense but quicken thou me in
[1:08:44] thy way, in the Lord's way. That it's so
[1:08:49] wonderful when you think about it. Now,
[1:08:52] just want to finish with a couple of
[1:08:56] more scriptures and then we close.
[1:08:58] Hebrews
[1:08:59] 9 27 and 28. I love this verse. And he
[1:09:05] says, "And as it is appointed unto men
[1:09:09] once to
[1:09:10] die, but after this the
[1:09:13] judgment." So Christ was once of offered
[1:09:18] to bear the sins of many. And unto them,
[1:09:22] look unto them which one are those that
[1:09:26] look for
[1:09:28] him shall he appear the second time
[1:09:31] without sin unto salvation. So I can
[1:09:34] only encourage you. Look for him. Look
[1:09:37] for him. Look for his coming. Look for
[1:09:40] him every day. Look for him to quicken
[1:09:43] his word to you to make himself more
[1:09:46] real to you. And the last one I have
[1:09:48] here, and we know that
[1:09:50] well. Romans 8:11.
[1:09:54] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:09:57] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[1:10:01] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:10:03] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:10:07] his
[1:10:08] spirit, by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:10:11] you.
[1:10:12] Here it
[1:10:14] is. It's not by the knowledge that's in
[1:10:17] you, but it's his spirit that dwelleth
[1:10:19] in you. And you know that gives me so
[1:10:22] much
[1:10:23] rest. If his spirit dwells in
[1:10:27] me, I don't care what's in here, how
[1:10:30] much or how
[1:10:31] little. If his spirit dwells in me, it
[1:10:35] will quicken this mortal body. And
[1:10:38] perhaps uh brother Ben can come up.
[1:10:41] Could we sing that song? If the same
[1:10:42] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:10:45] dwell in you. Well, God bless you all
[1:10:48] and I hope it encourages you.
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:01] Amen. To know him as life more
[1:11:04] abundantly. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's
[1:11:05] stand, shall we? Amen. We have that
[1:11:08] song, don't we? If the same spirit that
[1:11:09] raised up Christ from the dead dwell in
[1:11:11] you.
[1:11:13] Amen. Aren't you glad? You know, like
[1:11:15] brother Bram said, if you have the Holy
[1:11:17] Ghost, the rapture is in you, you're
[1:11:19] ready to leave. Amen. Aren't you excited
[1:11:22] to see him? Amen. Soon and very soon,
[1:11:25] we're going to see the king. Amen.
[1:11:26] Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother
[1:11:27] Albert. Appreciate that. Amen.
[1:11:30] Amen. If that same spirit that raised
[1:11:34] Christ from the dead dwell in
[1:11:38] you, dwell in
[1:11:41] you. If that same spirit that raised
[1:11:46] Christ from the dead dwell in
[1:11:49] you, dwell in
[1:11:52] you. He shall
[1:11:55] protect your mortal body.
[1:11:59] If that
[1:12:01] spirit dwell in
[1:12:04] you, he shall
[1:12:07] forget your mortal body.
[1:12:11] If that
[1:12:13] spirit dwell in you for Christmas. If
[1:12:17] that
[1:12:18] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:12:22] dead dwell in
[1:12:25] you, dwell in
[1:12:28] you. If that same spirit that raised
[1:12:33] Christ from the dead dwell in
[1:12:36] you, dwell in you.
[1:12:40] He shall
[1:12:42] quicken your mortal
[1:12:45] body. If that
[1:12:48] spirit dwell in
[1:12:51] you, he shall
[1:12:53] quicken your mortal
[1:12:57] body. If that
[1:13:00] spirit dwell in you, then of course
[1:13:03] again he shall
[1:13:05] quicken your mortal
[1:13:08] body. in the
[1:13:11] spirit dwell in
[1:13:14] you. We shall
[1:13:17] quicken your mortal
[1:13:20] body if the
[1:13:23] spirit dwell in
[1:13:26] you. Hallelujah. Amen. Any promise you
[1:13:30] see in the word, as brother Alberta
[1:13:32] said, say, Lord, make it real to me. Not
[1:13:34] in here, but in my heart. Reveal the
[1:13:36] reality of it. Amen. And God, how how
[1:13:38] many of has had the scripture been
[1:13:40] revealed? Quickened alive. Amen. God
[1:13:42] doesn't stop. Just keep walking with
[1:13:44] him. And Lord, keep revealing yourself.
[1:13:46] Make yourself alive in my life. Amen.
[1:13:48] Quicken your scripture. I mean, quicken
[1:13:49] me in your way. I love that psalm.
[1:13:51] That's powerful. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:13:53] Lord. Let's sing that song. I'm so glad
[1:13:55] I can say I'm one of them. You've been
[1:13:56] quickened by the spirit of God. It's
[1:13:58] transformed your life. Amen. Hey. Amen.
[1:14:01] You can sing. I'm so glad I can say I'm
[1:14:03] one of them. Amen.
[1:14:05] They were gathered in the upper room all
[1:14:09] praying in his name. They were baptized
[1:14:13] in the Holy Ghost and powerful service
[1:14:16] came. Now what he did for them that day,
[1:14:20] he'll do for you the same. I'm so glad
[1:14:24] that I can say I'm one of
[1:14:27] them. Oh, one of
[1:14:30] them. Yes, one of them.
[1:14:34] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:14:38] them. Hallelujah. I'm one of
[1:14:42] them. I'm one of
[1:14:45] them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:14:49] of them.
[1:14:52] Though these people may not let it be
[1:14:55] the host of worldly faith, they have all
[1:14:59] received their Pentecost baptized in
[1:15:02] Jesus' name. And I'm telling them both
[1:15:06] far and wide. His power is yet the same.
[1:15:10] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:15:14] them. Yes, one of
[1:15:17] them. I'm one of them.
[1:15:22] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of

[1:20:14] this, I'd be asleep. So, I wouldn't be
[1:20:15] having this experience with you." So, I

[1:20:40] Sorry. Can we start from the verse?
[1:20:44] Sorry, there's my
[1:20:46] bad story from the Bible
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:20:55] long how the wicked king command and
[1:20:59] they be thrown into the flame because
[1:21:03] they would not bow. They deny their
[1:21:06] father's name.
[1:21:09] Mama said the case could hide on a
[1:21:12] balcony sold all. When he looked in it,
[1:21:16] he was shocked by all the things he saw.
[1:21:20] Cuz he thought that he would find them
[1:21:23] like dead upon the ground. But set free.
[1:21:28] He counted for walking all
[1:21:32] around. Then I'll set
[1:21:35] away. There's one thing that I must
[1:21:38] show. If we went in and three came out,
[1:21:42] they went that morning. And I never will
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:47] forget across the floor. These are the
[1:21:52] words I heard say while shouting through
[1:21:55] the door.
[1:21:58] Well, he's still in the fire and he's
[1:22:01] walking in the flame. And he'll be there
[1:22:05] to help you when you call upon his name.
[1:22:10] And he can still deliver by his almighty
[1:22:14] power. While he alone, it's good to know
[1:22:18] that he's still in the
[1:22:21] fire. Oh, he alone. It's good to know
[1:22:26] he's still in the
[1:22:29] fire. Now, my friend, you may be
[1:22:32] destined to face life's hardest way, but

[1:22:39] power of the

[1:22:49] today is still alive.
