[53:38] Bibles and and we'll turn to uh
[53:40] Revelations chapter 3 I'd like to um
[53:44] continue on I've been speaking on about
[53:46] battle plans Battle Tactics and uh I
[53:49] want to just go into some things we we
[53:51] see uh there's many prophecies in the
[53:53] Bible that that is the plan of the enemy
[53:56] and we just just want to go on to them
[53:57] today uh we're just going to read here
[54:00] from I'm sure it's very familiar por of
[54:02] scripture to everyone but we're going to
[54:04] read about the time that we're alive in
[54:06] and we'll go to Revelations 3 and
[54:08] ver14 and it says here and unto the
[54:11] angel of the church the lady o sins
[54:13] right these things sayith the amen the
[54:15] faithful and true witness the beginning
[54:16] of the creation of God I Know Thy works
[54:19] and thou art neither cold or hot uh I
[54:22] would that thou were cold or hot so then
[54:24] because Thou Art luk Wan neither cold or
[54:26] hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[54:28] because thou sayest I am rich and
[54:30] increase with goods and have need of
[54:32] nothing knowest not that thou art riched
[54:34] and miserable poor and blind and naked I
[54:37] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[54:39] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[54:42] white rment that thou mayest be clothed
[54:44] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[54:46] not appear and anoint thine eyes with i
[54:49] s that they may see as many as I love I
[54:52] rebuke and chase him be zealous
[54:54] therefore and repent behold I stand the
[54:56] door and knock If any man hear my voice
[54:58] and open the door I will come into him
[55:01] and will s with him and he with me to
[55:03] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[55:05] with me in my throne even as I overcame
[55:07] and am sit down with my father in his
[55:10] throne he that hath an ear Le him hear
[55:12] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[55:15] amen and we'll just go to 1 Corinthians
[55:17] chapter 14 we'll just read uh one verse
[55:20] there amen anden you thankful you it
[55:22] says if any man hear my voice and we
[55:25] have he heard his voice in the this end
[55:26] time
[55:28] Hallelujah uh just as a context we're
[55:31] just going to read 1 Corinthians
[55:33] 14:8 and it says
[55:36] here for if the trumpet give an
[55:38] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[55:41] himself to the battle amen may the Lord
[55:43] bless his word you may be seated so I
[55:46] want to uh I want to look into now uh
[55:50] the the working of the enemy and I want
[55:52] to see because with a battle how you
[55:55] know to prepare your for battle you you
[55:57] know I'm just going to review some
[55:58] things very quickly but to prepare
[56:00] yourself for battle you must know three
[56:02] things you must know what your
[56:04] Battlefield is you must know your enemy
[56:06] and his tactics and his weapons and then
[56:08] you must know you and your tactics and
[56:10] your weapon if you don't know any of
[56:12] those three you're going to get whipped
[56:14] if you don't know what your Battlefield
[56:15] is how can you prepare for the
[56:16] battlefield if you don't know how the
[56:18] enemy is going to use his weapon or what
[56:20] weapon he he has how can you be prepared
[56:22] to counter that weapon so we must know
[56:24] all these three things and we see that
[56:27] that Battlefield intelligence in the
[56:29] Bible is prophecy because intelligence
[56:31] tells you what the enemy is going to do
[56:33] and we can see in the scripture that God
[56:36] has not only revealed himself in this
[56:38] end time but he's revealed Satan and his
[56:40] workings so we can look into the
[56:42] scripture and we can see now what he
[56:44] intends to do and how he's going to do
[56:46] it Hallelujah aren't you glad that the
[56:48] enemy is exposed in this time that he
[56:50] cannot hide in this world but he is
[56:52] exposed amen and I just want to read uh
[56:54] just a few portions of scripture we'll
[56:56] just go to Isaiah 14 and um I'm sure you
[57:01] know most of these things are familiar
[57:03] because brother Bram tells us we must we
[57:05] must we must study our enemy we must
[57:07] study our opponent because if you don't
[57:09] study him how you going to be able to
[57:11] combat what he does so he tells us we
[57:14] must study him so I think we should give
[57:16] take the advice of Malachi 4 and
[57:18] actually study our opponent so we see
[57:20] here in Isaiah 14 and verse 12 and now
[57:23] this is the uh this is the ambition of
[57:25] the devil this is what he wants to do
[57:27] this is what he has planned in his mind
[57:29] this is what I'm going to achieve and he
[57:32] and and we read here it says how Thou
[57:34] Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of
[57:36] the morning how Thou Art cut down to the
[57:39] ground that did US weaken the Nations
[57:41] for thou Hast said in thine heart I'll
[57:43] Ascend into heaven I'll exalt my throne
[57:46] above the stars of God I will sit also
[57:49] upon the Mount of the congregation and
[57:51] the sides of the north I will Ascend
[57:53] above the heights of the clouds I will
[57:55] be like the most high
[57:56] yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell
[57:58] to the sides of the pit they that see
[58:00] thee shall narrowly look upon thee and
[58:02] consider thee saying is this the man
[58:05] that made the Earth to tremble that did
[58:07] Shake kingdoms that made the world as a
[58:09] Wilderness and destroyed the cities
[58:11] thereof that open not the house of his
[58:13] prisoners so we see that the enemy's
[58:16] ambition he says I will be like God I
[58:18] will be worshiped and it's amazing that
[58:20] it says and they that see him shall you
[58:23] look upon him and say is this the man
[58:25] and I trust you you can put yourself in
[58:26] that scripture because a lot of people
[58:28] can't see the enemy but when he is
[58:30] brought down into hell when he has
[58:32] because he said I will Ascend but he is
[58:34] he has been cast down and we are the
[58:37] ones that are ascending today and we can
[58:39] see here that this word says He Shall
[58:41] Ascend but he has been cast down and it
[58:44] says that they that see thee shall
[58:45] narrowly look upon thee and consider
[58:47] thee well we're going to consider this
[58:49] one in his real State this one that's
[58:51] been brought down into the pits of hell
[58:54] they that see the hey we've seen the in
[58:56] this day we see what he does we're not
[58:58] we're not ignorant of the devil's
[59:00] devices Hallelujah so he says I'll be
[59:02] like the most high other words he's
[59:04] saying I'll be God I'll be worshiped
[59:06] this is his
[59:07] ambition and then let's go to Second
[59:10] Thessalonians and I and we're just going
[59:12] to read here as
[59:16] well and 2 Thessalonians and we'll read
[59:19] uh chapter 2 and and verses 1
[59:24] to6 now Paul Paul is speaking he's
[59:28] speaking to a people and he's trying to
[59:29] establish you know stabilize their faith
[59:31] here and he says now we beseech you
[59:33] Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[59:36] and by our gathering together unto him
[59:38] and we've gathered to him that you be
[59:40] not soon shaken of mind or troubled
[59:42] neither by Spirit nor by word nor by
[59:44] letter as from us as at the day of the
[59:47] Lord is at hand let no man deceive you
[59:50] by any means for that day shall not come
[59:52] except there come a falling away first
[59:55] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[59:57] of predition who opposeth and exalted
[59:59] himself above all that is called God or
[1:00:02] that is worshiped so that he as God sth
[1:00:05] in the temple of God showing himself
[1:00:07] that he is God remember ye not that when
[1:00:10] I was with you I told you these things
[1:00:12] and you know what withholdeth that he
[1:00:15] might be revealed in his time for the
[1:00:17] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[1:00:19] only he who now leth which is the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost will let until he be taken out of
[1:00:24] the way so Paul is saying don't be
[1:00:26] troubled by these things he said the day
[1:00:28] of the Lord is not coming until until
[1:00:30] there is a great pulling away so he's
[1:00:32] speaking of a future event and he says
[1:00:35] now that there will be a great falling
[1:00:36] away and then and then Satan will come
[1:00:38] in himself and be worshiped as God so
[1:00:41] he's speaking of a future event but he's
[1:00:42] saying now that the mystery of iniquity
[1:00:44] do already work and and I think it's
[1:00:47] James or John he says that the spirit of
[1:00:49] antichrist is already here we're not
[1:00:51] waiting for him to come it's already
[1:00:52] working among among the people so
[1:00:56] but Paul is speaking of a future event
[1:00:58] so we can see that what what Paul is
[1:01:00] speaking now to the church what Isaiah
[1:01:02] is speaking is is exactly the same thing
[1:01:05] and so his ambition now is to be
[1:01:07] worshiped as God and it also says that
[1:01:10] you know Revelations 13 and verse 8 I'll
[1:01:12] just read it quickly and all that dwell
[1:01:14] upon the Earth shall worship Him whose
[1:01:17] names are not written in the Book of
[1:01:18] Life of the lamb slain from the
[1:01:20] foundation of the world if any man have
[1:01:22] an ear let him here so John so he says
[1:01:25] all
[1:01:26] that is that encompasses everyone whose
[1:01:28] name is not written on the Lamb's Book
[1:01:30] of Life shall worship him so he's going
[1:01:33] to be worshiped and we and we understand
[1:01:35] from the reading you know of the
[1:01:37] scripture and by and by what what what
[1:01:40] the prophet of God taught us in this day
[1:01:42] that this is the day where he is fully
[1:01:43] worshiped as the God of this world and
[1:01:46] we understand by because the devil he
[1:01:48] he's just a um he just repeats his
[1:01:50] method the method he used against Eve is
[1:01:52] the same method he comes and tries
[1:01:54] against you and we see that in that that
[1:01:57] against Eve we know that he took the the
[1:02:00] word of God and he twisted it so he gave
[1:02:02] 99% truth 1% era to Eve and and and he
[1:02:07] preached to her and she received what he
[1:02:09] was preaching and then that's how she
[1:02:11] fell from behind the word of God and
[1:02:13] that's and that's his method all the way
[1:02:15] through US he'll take the word of God
[1:02:17] and he'll craft an idol out of that word
[1:02:20] and then he'll present it to the people
[1:02:21] and the people will worship that Idol
[1:02:23] and they're not worshiping God anymore
[1:02:25] and we'll go on that a bit more but we
[1:02:27] have he says this in Satan's Eden in
[1:02:30] 1965 and to me this is astounding but he
[1:02:32] says he says the God of this world today
[1:02:35] the worship person of this world today
[1:02:37] is Satan and people are ignorant of
[1:02:40] worshiping Satan but it's Satan
[1:02:41] impersonating himself as the church this
[1:02:43] what we read in second Thessalonians see
[1:02:45] as the church they worship Satan
[1:02:47] thinking they are worshiping God through
[1:02:49] the church but it's the way Satan has
[1:02:52] done it oh you say but wait a minute we
[1:02:54] preach the word look back here at my
[1:02:55] text tonight Satan was the one preached
[1:02:58] the word to eeve first God has said see
[1:03:01] it's the
[1:03:02] misconstruing that part of the scripture
[1:03:04] that applies to the day he will let you
[1:03:07] know all that Jesus did was perfectly
[1:03:09] well he will let you know all that Moses
[1:03:11] did was perfectly well but when it when
[1:03:14] but when you take the promises that he
[1:03:16] gave for this day then that was applied
[1:03:19] to another age that's all he has to do
[1:03:22] see is to get the people to believe it
[1:03:25] that way that's all for you cannot take
[1:03:28] one word away from it or one add one
[1:03:30] word to it uh that but that's what he
[1:03:33] does people ignorantly worshiping Satan
[1:03:36] thinking they're worshiping God as we're
[1:03:39] warned in the prophecy of 2
[1:03:41] Thessalonians and then he and then he
[1:03:42] reads the scripture that we just read so
[1:03:45] he's saying he's saying all the Satan
[1:03:47] has to do is say the promise for this
[1:03:49] age that God is a lot in his word he
[1:03:51] says he says all he has to do is get you
[1:03:53] to believe that's in another time that's
[1:03:56] that's all he has to do because we know
[1:03:58] our lord Jesus is The Great I Am he's
[1:04:00] the present God and he he is sure he was
[1:04:03] in history and he will be in the future
[1:04:05] but he's he's fulfilling his word right
[1:04:08] now and where he's fulfilling his word
[1:04:10] is where he is and I want to be where he
[1:04:12] is amen I'm not interested you know I'm
[1:04:15] excited about going walking on streets
[1:04:17] of gold but we're not there yet what is
[1:04:19] he doing here today we must be where he
[1:04:21] is the present God Amen so we we need to
[1:04:25] look into the word and not only see out
[1:04:27] the scripture that must be fulfilled in
[1:04:29] this hour but we must see what the devil
[1:04:31] is doing in this hour as well so a a
[1:04:35] historical God is a is an idol only a
[1:04:38] historical God is an idol right amen
[1:04:41] only a god of the future is is an idol
[1:04:43] as well because he's not he's not there
[1:04:46] he's here amen so we want to we want to
[1:04:50] look into the word and he says also he
[1:04:51] says he says that deceitfulness of the
[1:04:54] church today the son of predition the
[1:04:57] devil the son of predition the devil the
[1:05:00] them people worshiping Satan in this day
[1:05:02] thinking they're worshiping God but
[1:05:04] they're worshiping him through a Creed
[1:05:05] and man-made denominations and Creeds
[1:05:07] that's brought people right down to the
[1:05:09] greatest deception that the world has
[1:05:11] ever known of Amen the people can use
[1:05:14] the name of Jesus Christ they can use
[1:05:16] scripture but as the enemy has as has
[1:05:19] comeing and he's toen those scriptures
[1:05:21] and he's fashioned of God out of the
[1:05:23] word and those people think being
[1:05:26] sincere people it's the system is the
[1:05:28] cursed thing and those poor people are
[1:05:30] trapped in that system but that system
[1:05:32] is fashioned and Idol out of the word of
[1:05:35] God and presented it to the people and
[1:05:37] then they think they're worshiping Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ that's right he says it's the
[1:05:41] greatest deception there's ever been now
[1:05:45] in order in order for uh era to be to be
[1:05:49] accepted the truth must be rejected
[1:05:51] first and we can see this when when uh
[1:05:55] Jesus is on trial and pilate tries to
[1:05:58] tries to let him go and there's the
[1:05:59] feast time and then pilate brings uh you
[1:06:02] know brings it before the people do you
[1:06:04] want Jesus or do you want barabus and
[1:06:07] this barabus we you know from reading
[1:06:09] the scripture we see that he was a he
[1:06:11] was a murderer and he he committed
[1:06:14] murder during an Insurrection so he was
[1:06:17] he was part of a rebellion against the
[1:06:18] government in that time and he was a
[1:06:20] murderer and pilate said do you want
[1:06:23] Jesus or barabus and the people said
[1:06:25] give us barabus he says what shall we do
[1:06:28] with this Jesus crucify him and it's
[1:06:30] interesting because you know what what
[1:06:33] they were receiving the people they were
[1:06:36] receiving they were identifying
[1:06:38] themselves with a murderer and rejecting
[1:06:40] the Prince of Life and even his very
[1:06:43] name is incredible you know barabus it's
[1:06:45] of it's of cheli origin so it's a
[1:06:48] Babylonian name of
[1:06:49] origin and it means to be it means
[1:06:52] arrogancy Majesty PP PR to be proud to
[1:06:56] be swelling so and he so this this
[1:07:00] barabus uh and also barabus is the son
[1:07:03] of ABBA that's what the name you know
[1:07:05] but so this barabus was the son of
[1:07:07] arrogancy majesty PP he was he was proud
[1:07:10] and he and his attributes was he was a
[1:07:12] murderer and you can trace that right
[1:07:14] back to Cain you can trace that right
[1:07:17] back to the to the Devil Himself I will
[1:07:19] Ascend I'll be like the most high he
[1:07:21] made a more beautiful kingdom than than
[1:07:23] Michael did was that P Majesty proud
[1:07:26] arrogant wasn't willing to yield himself
[1:07:29] to what God would have done and so the
[1:07:32] people accepted they were identifying
[1:07:34] with that man they wanted that man we'll
[1:07:37] receive this one we won't receive that
[1:07:40] one and so they received you know they
[1:07:43] received a
[1:07:44] murderer and what happens is now if the
[1:07:47] church rejects the spirit of God what do
[1:07:50] they receive they receive the spirit of
[1:07:52] the devil you know it's just it's really
[1:07:54] that it's really that flat it's just how
[1:07:56] it is so they they were rejecting the
[1:07:58] Prince of Life they couldn't identify
[1:08:00] themselves with this Man From Galilee
[1:08:02] all they could do is identify themselves
[1:08:03] with this man barabus and they rejected
[1:08:06] the Prince of Life and they were
[1:08:07] accepting a spirit of murder a proud AR
[1:08:11] you look at the scribes and Pharisees
[1:08:12] they were proud they were arrogant they
[1:08:14] had their pump they you know they
[1:08:16] dressed all right and they did they
[1:08:17] showed everything on the outside and
[1:08:19] went through their ceremonies and
[1:08:21] pretended to be so holy in these things
[1:08:23] what were they pump was all pump proud
[1:08:26] arrogant amen and they are murderers as
[1:08:29] well yes it was in them to murder the
[1:08:31] Prince of Life they consented how can we
[1:08:33] destroy this man right amen right so
[1:08:37] when they received barabus they were
[1:08:38] just receiving what was in them to begin
[1:08:40] with but the woman at the well or you
[1:08:42] take you know Peter James or John or
[1:08:44] whoever it was when they received the
[1:08:46] lamb as many as received him gave you
[1:08:48] power to become the sons of God
[1:08:50] hallelujah when when the woman at the
[1:08:52] well saw saw our lord Jesus she was
[1:08:55] accepting amen really what was what she
[1:08:58] was meant to be glory hallelujah amen
[1:09:01] it's the same thing with us friends when
[1:09:03] you reject this world and you know when
[1:09:06] light comes across your path amen when
[1:09:09] this message came across your path and
[1:09:10] you said that's me mean this is the real
[1:09:13] me you're identifying really not only
[1:09:16] where you're from but really the real
[1:09:17] you amen
[1:09:19] hallelujah amen we want to we want to do
[1:09:23] that Glory it's such a difference now
[1:09:26] you know when when when Paul is speaking
[1:09:29] about Jesus in Philippians 2 he says let
[1:09:32] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:09:34] Christ Jesus totally opposite now to
[1:09:36] barabus and those lot who being in the
[1:09:38] form of God thought it not to be robbery
[1:09:40] to be equal with God he made himself of
[1:09:42] no reputation but took upon himself the
[1:09:44] form of a servant and was made in the
[1:09:46] likeness of men so he he made himself
[1:09:49] he's the king of glory and he made
[1:09:51] himself the L of the low he made he was
[1:09:53] the meek and lowly one
[1:09:56] and this this same he said Paul saying
[1:09:58] let this mind let this attitude let this
[1:10:00] way of being be in you which is also in
[1:10:03] your king you know he's saying let this
[1:10:06] mind be in you and you say well what did
[1:10:08] he do he submitted himself to the word
[1:10:11] that was allotted to him that's what he
[1:10:13] did when he was in the garden he said
[1:10:15] not my will but thy will be done he said
[1:10:18] for this cause I've come into the world
[1:10:20] and so he submitted himself to the
[1:10:22] scripture because he remember he was a
[1:10:24] man he was he he was fully God he was
[1:10:27] fully man and he had to look into the
[1:10:28] word and see what word he had to fulfill
[1:10:31] and he had to subject himself you know
[1:10:34] he would have read Isaiah 53 when he
[1:10:36] goes up to mount Transfiguration Moses
[1:10:38] and Elijah appear to him one of the
[1:10:40] accounts said they begin to tell him
[1:10:42] what he must accomplish at Jerusalem and
[1:10:45] they begin to preach to him you must
[1:10:47] fulfill Isaiah 53 you are the one that
[1:10:49] that that Isaiah was talking about you
[1:10:51] must be wounded for our transgressions
[1:10:53] you must be bruised for our iniquity
[1:10:55] that chastisement of our peace must be
[1:10:56] upon you and by your stripes we shall be
[1:10:59] healed so they begin to preach to the
[1:11:01] lamb this is what you must accomplish
[1:11:03] and in his Humanity he took that word
[1:11:05] and he subjected himself to that word
[1:11:07] amen and he was obedient to death he
[1:11:09] went to the Cross Hallelujah Glory but
[1:11:11] the thing is he wasn't just looking at
[1:11:12] that he was looking at you he saw that
[1:11:15] joy that was set before him and that joy
[1:11:16] is you amen he saw it was more than just
[1:11:19] him dying but he was going to race he
[1:11:22] said destroy this Temple and in 3 days
[1:11:24] I'll raise back up again glory amen and
[1:11:28] that word destroy actually means a
[1:11:29] loosening loose me from this Temple
[1:11:31] Hallelujah he didn't just want to be
[1:11:33] with his people you want to be in his
[1:11:34] people said loose me from the temple so
[1:11:36] I can have real Fellowship amen with my
[1:11:39] with my children Hallelujah Glory
[1:11:41] blessed his name amen glory so we must
[1:11:44] be willing to remember let this mind
[1:11:46] that was in Christ Jesus be in you so we
[1:11:49] must be willing to subject ourselves say
[1:11:52] Lord what does your word say of me what
[1:11:54] would you have me do amen now you got to
[1:11:57] take the you know it's like when they
[1:11:59] had to eat the lamb in the days of
[1:12:00] Exodus they had to eat the whole lamb
[1:12:02] not just the nice chops and whatever you
[1:12:04] like about the lamb all the all the
[1:12:06] yucky bits I'll just put it all the yuck
[1:12:09] they had to eat it all eat the whole
[1:12:11] thing some things in the word are very
[1:12:13] pleasant you're going in a Rapture you
[1:12:14] have eternal life hallelujah amen your
[1:12:17] joint ears with Christ other things seem
[1:12:20] like a reproach other things seem don't
[1:12:22] seem so pretty people may think well you
[1:12:25] know I'm you know but I look
[1:12:26] oldfashioned how I live and all these
[1:12:28] things I have to do that's not about
[1:12:30] doing it's about a love relationship if
[1:12:32] you love him Lord I want to be pleasing
[1:12:35] to you amen what would you have me do
[1:12:38] Lord amen oh here it is do this yes Lord
[1:12:40] I love you I'm so glad I can do it for
[1:12:42] you hey David's David's Mighty Men his
[1:12:45] smallest desire his desire was I need to
[1:12:47] drink from the well his and that
[1:12:50] smallest desire became a great
[1:12:51] commandment to them and they didn't even
[1:12:54] ask for permission they just went and
[1:12:55] got the water amen and if that is if
[1:12:58] that is the attribute of a believer in
[1:13:00] that day Gentile believer how much more
[1:13:02] in this day amen when the bride of
[1:13:04] Christ doesn't just have a have a
[1:13:06] Earthly King but a Heavenly King they
[1:13:08] say what would you have me do Lord what
[1:13:10] would you have me do amen amen
[1:13:13] hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:13:15] know this this word you know it says in
[1:13:18] Hebrews 13 He says let us there go let
[1:13:21] us go forth therefore unto him without
[1:13:24] the camp bearing his reproach for here
[1:13:26] we have no continuing City but we seek
[1:13:29] one to come so Paul he says let's we
[1:13:32] must bear his reproach but the reason we
[1:13:35] bear his reproach is because we we've
[1:13:37] met the the king of that City and mean
[1:13:40] we know where we're going that's why all
[1:13:42] these things of life you know people
[1:13:43] look at you and you think you're mad why
[1:13:46] would you live this way there's no fun
[1:13:47] being this way why don't you do all
[1:13:49] these things you say I've met the king
[1:13:51] of a city and it's an eternal City and
[1:13:53] I'm going to that City he's given me
[1:13:55] what I need to get to that City it's
[1:13:57] everything else who cares about
[1:13:59] everything else this world won't even be
[1:14:01] a memory amen not that far away
[1:14:04] Hallelujah glory amen Amen brother Ed
[1:14:09] one shared with me Wednesday night he
[1:14:10] said you from Luke 6 woe unto you that
[1:14:14] all uh when all men speak well of you
[1:14:17] for so did their fathers to the false
[1:14:19] prophets so you don't saying good it's
[1:14:21] people speak good of you woe unto you if
[1:14:24] everyone speaks well of you you don't
[1:14:27] you don't just try and be weird you just
[1:14:28] you just live the word let the word live
[1:14:30] in you amen that's all we need to do yes
[1:14:34] sir you know Paul you know Peter said
[1:14:36] you you're a peculiar people what does
[1:14:38] that mean a strange people you don't
[1:14:40] have to try and be strange you just
[1:14:42] become one with this it'll make you
[1:14:45] different we're Anointed with a very
[1:14:47] different Spirit to the spirit that's
[1:14:48] out there in this world and the sooner
[1:14:50] we just come come to peace with that
[1:14:52] they hated our Lord they hated the
[1:14:55] disciples they hated the Believers all
[1:14:56] the way down through am and they have
[1:14:59] and they're waiting for without us
[1:15:01] they're not made perfect and they're
[1:15:03] waiting for you to come to your position
[1:15:04] to take a Rapture in this hour amen so
[1:15:07] we might as well just have peace the
[1:15:09] devil you know the world's not going to
[1:15:10] like us that's all right I'd rather be
[1:15:13] friends with Jesus than friends with
[1:15:15] with with the world amen amen hallelujah
[1:15:19] hallelujah blessed be now the CH so the
[1:15:24] church by accepting barabus was
[1:15:26] identifying the spirit on them to be
[1:15:28] proud arrogant murdering Spirit now this
[1:15:32] would then repeat in the early early
[1:15:34] church with the Antichrist Spirit coming
[1:15:37] in in the form of deception of the Deeds
[1:15:40] of the
[1:15:42] nicians uh in the Ephesian age where man
[1:15:44] would fashion ungodly things out of the
[1:15:46] word of God and give it to the people
[1:15:49] now let's just go to Romans chapter 1
[1:15:51] I'm just going to show you how this is
[1:15:54] this is so
[1:15:57] [Music]
[1:16:05] he says here in Romans chapter 1 and we
[1:16:08] at verses 17 down to
[1:16:11] 23 so Paul's speaking here he says for
[1:16:15] therein is the righteousness of God
[1:16:16] reveals from Faith to Faith at is is
[1:16:19] written the just shall live by faith for
[1:16:21] the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven
[1:16:23] against all ungodliness and
[1:16:25] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:16:28] truth in unrighteousness because they
[1:16:31] which may be known of God is Manifest in
[1:16:34] them for God has shown it unto them for
[1:16:36] the invisible things of him from the
[1:16:39] creation of the world the clearly seen
[1:16:42] being understood by the things that are
[1:16:44] made even his eternal power and godhead
[1:16:47] so that they are not without excuse
[1:16:49] because that when they knew God they
[1:16:52] glorified him not as God neither were
[1:16:54] thankful but became vain in their
[1:16:56] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[1:16:58] darkened professing themselves to be
[1:17:01] wise they became fools and changed the
[1:17:03] glory of The Incorruptible God into an
[1:17:05] image made like un corruptible man and
[1:17:10] and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[1:17:12] creepy things wherefore God also gave
[1:17:15] them up to uncleanness through the lust
[1:17:17] of their own Hearts to dishonor their
[1:17:19] own bodies between themselves so they
[1:17:22] took they took they saw you can see God
[1:17:24] in nature brother Braham said nature was
[1:17:25] his first Bible and you can see God in
[1:17:28] nature and they took they took this God
[1:17:31] that made all things and then they
[1:17:33] fashioned an idol and then they took an
[1:17:36] attribute I'll show you in the gods of
[1:17:37] the Egyptians they took an attribute of
[1:17:39] God and they made an idol and they made
[1:17:42] that a
[1:17:44] God I'll bring it into the Christian
[1:17:46] world so you take for example you take
[1:17:48] the Egyptian
[1:17:49] gods you know you take
[1:17:53] um you I just I don't I don't know how
[1:17:56] to pronounce these names um um oseris
[1:17:59] he's the god of the afterlife death life
[1:18:01] and Resurrection so he's one God uh uh
[1:18:05] apus with uh who is a bull he is the god
[1:18:07] of strength and fertility and Horus is
[1:18:10] the god of the sun and kingship what
[1:18:14] have they done God is a king God is the
[1:18:17] god of the Resurrection he's the god of
[1:18:19] life and death he's the god of strength
[1:18:22] he's the god of fertility God of life
[1:18:25] lifegiving amen he's the god of the son
[1:18:27] he made the son and he's a king amen
[1:18:30] those are all attributes of God they've
[1:18:31] taken from the one true God and they
[1:18:34] split those attributes down and made
[1:18:36] Gods out of those attributes and what is
[1:18:39] that idolatry oh that's
[1:18:41] idolatry now that same thing you can do
[1:18:44] with this Bible yes and that's what
[1:18:46] people have done they have taken
[1:18:48] attributes of God and then made that
[1:18:50] this is
[1:18:51] Jesus here we go God is a god of love
[1:18:54] God loves everybody don't judge anyone
[1:18:57] what he is a god of love so God so loved
[1:19:00] the world he gave his only begotten son
[1:19:02] amen this this is a love letter to you
[1:19:05] yes God is a god of love you know God
[1:19:09] wants to bless
[1:19:10] you amen plant your seed and he'll bless
[1:19:14] you look how prosperous we are God will
[1:19:16] bless you hallelujah look at all this
[1:19:18] stuff of God God is a god of prosperity
[1:19:21] y amen but he gives you the character to
[1:19:23] use that prosperity
[1:19:25] and prosperity doesn't mean he's
[1:19:27] blessing you and being poor doesn't mean
[1:19:28] he's cursing you amen Sunshine doesn't
[1:19:31] mean God is pleased and Rain doesn't
[1:19:33] mean he's displeased
[1:19:36] amen you know Jesus is a god of mercy
[1:19:39] and forgiveness he is a god of mercy and
[1:19:41] forgiveness but don't take it too far
[1:19:44] yes amen you know they say you know
[1:19:48] Jesus is a non-judgmental
[1:19:50] God and they take a scripture so here we
[1:19:53] go we're going to Fashion This Is How
[1:19:54] They fashion
[1:19:55] Matthew 71 judge not that that ye be not
[1:19:58] judged and that word judge actually
[1:20:00] means to to condemnation so don't
[1:20:03] condemn L you be condemned that's what
[1:20:06] it's actually saying but people say it's
[1:20:07] a sin to judge what has happened they
[1:20:09] fashioned an idol and they're
[1:20:11] prostrating themselves in front of that
[1:20:12] Idol that's right amen John 7:24 Jesus
[1:20:17] said also he he said judge not according
[1:20:18] to their parents but judge righteous
[1:20:20] judgment yes so the only way you can
[1:20:23] reconcile them he says judge not in
[1:20:25] other words don't condemn L you be
[1:20:26] condemned it says judge righteous
[1:20:28] judgment so the Saints are called to be
[1:20:30] able to judge between right and wrong
[1:20:33] amen we're not just to blindly go on and
[1:20:35] say go yeah it's all flowers and
[1:20:37] sunshine and and picnics and everyone's
[1:20:39] happy and we're all going to get to
[1:20:40] heaven there's going to be people who
[1:20:42] are not getting to heaven right but
[1:20:44] there's a group that's going to heaven I
[1:20:46] want to be in that number amen I don't
[1:20:48] want to be those who who reject him so
[1:20:51] we can see just from those illustrations
[1:20:53] they take God and they fashion Idols out
[1:20:56] of God and then they worship that and
[1:20:58] they're worshiping Satan through that
[1:21:00] Idol but it's but but they say it's
[1:21:02] Jesus it's an idol being crafted out of
[1:21:05] the
[1:21:07] word amen you see let's just go to First
[1:21:10] Kings 12 I'm just going to we're just
[1:21:12] going to jump to
[1:21:15] here now remember this is important
[1:21:18] because of this is this is Satan's
[1:21:19] method all the way down it's the same
[1:21:22] method here cuz he wants to be
[1:21:26] worshiped now Kings 12 1 Kings
[1:21:32] 12 and we'll read verses
[1:21:34] 25-31 now this is just after the the
[1:21:37] Kingdom's been split after
[1:21:40] Solomon and this is this is this is the
[1:21:42] one who's been given the 10 tribes he
[1:21:44] says then jeroboam built built uh uh
[1:21:47] shisham in Mount Ephraim and dwelt
[1:21:49] therein and went out from th and built a
[1:21:53] a pineal and and jobah said in his heart
[1:21:56] now shall the kingdom return to the
[1:21:58] House of David if this people go up to
[1:22:00] sacrifice in their house uh of the Lord
[1:22:03] at Jerusalem then shall the heart of
[1:22:05] this people turn uh again unto their
[1:22:08] lord even to reom the king of Judah and
[1:22:10] they shall kill me and go again to rabom
[1:22:13] King of Judah whereupon the king took
[1:22:15] counsel and made two carves of gold and
[1:22:17] said unto them it is too much for you to
[1:22:20] go up to Jerusalem and behold thy Gods o
[1:22:22] Israel that brought thee up up out of
[1:22:24] the land of Egypt and he set one in
[1:22:27] bethl and the other he put in Dan and
[1:22:29] this thing became a sin for the people
[1:22:30] went to worship before one even unto den
[1:22:34] and he made a house of high places and
[1:22:36] made priests of the lowest people which
[1:22:39] were not of the sons of levite so he's
[1:22:42] he's devised now don't go to the God's
[1:22:44] provided place of worship because
[1:22:46] remember in Deuteronomy God said is a
[1:22:49] place you shall not not worship in every
[1:22:50] gate but you shall wor Worship in the
[1:22:52] gate where I put my name yes and we know
[1:22:55] that that was that was at the Tabernacle
[1:22:57] in the wilderness that's where he he he
[1:22:59] he put his place of worship so this King
[1:23:01] devised way now that that the people the
[1:23:04] Israelite people God's covenant people
[1:23:06] wouldn't worship God where God wanted to
[1:23:08] be worshiped but he built these two
[1:23:10] golden cares that the people would go to
[1:23:12] another place and they' worship and you
[1:23:15] see these are the gods that brought you
[1:23:17] out of out of Egypt what that he took an
[1:23:19] attribute of God being a deliverer being
[1:23:22] a redeemer being a one that places you
[1:23:24] in the promised land he took those
[1:23:26] attributes and put them into golden
[1:23:27] Cales worship these Gods amen
[1:23:31] yes and he he did this now and he said
[1:23:36] these are your Gods Israel this is your
[1:23:38] god that's how so they go before the
[1:23:41] thing and they could literally say we're
[1:23:43] worshiping Jehovah God in this place
[1:23:45] they weren't they weren't worshiping God
[1:23:47] they're worshiping
[1:23:51] Satan and it's the same thing today you
[1:23:54] you can you just bring that into today
[1:23:55] there's a chosen place of worship where
[1:23:57] God has put his name today and God put
[1:24:00] his name in his son Christ Jesus and the
[1:24:02] only way you can worship in that chosen
[1:24:04] place is to be under the blood of his
[1:24:06] son and the only way you can be under
[1:24:07] the blood is if the spirit of God dwells
[1:24:09] in you I mean if the life of God is in
[1:24:11] you then you're in God's chosen place of
[1:24:13] worship you know many times we we read
[1:24:16] the scripture if you abide in me and my
[1:24:18] words abide in you ask what you will and
[1:24:19] it shall be and some people take that
[1:24:22] from a Methodist point of view and they
[1:24:23] say if I read it enough if I listen
[1:24:25] enough if I do enough then I'm abiding
[1:24:28] in the word but that true abiding in the
[1:24:30] word of my word God himself dwells in
[1:24:32] you if I dwell in you the living Christ
[1:24:35] comes and dwells in you then ask what
[1:24:37] you will and it shall be amen that is
[1:24:40] God's provided place of worship and the
[1:24:42] same time as being in Jesus Christ amen
[1:24:45] the very life life of God comes and
[1:24:47] dwells in you that means you're in that
[1:24:49] place and you can't leave that place if
[1:24:51] you're sealed in Hallelujah am so that
[1:24:56] was his tactic now to to get the people
[1:25:00] to worship somewhere else and because
[1:25:02] they were Israelites they thought we're
[1:25:04] God's chosen people God cannot destroy
[1:25:07] us that was that was their attitude all
[1:25:09] the way down when Jeremiah preached
[1:25:10] against him Amos came down all those
[1:25:13] prophets were saying judgment's coming
[1:25:14] you better turn back to God they were so
[1:25:16] comfortable in their in their way of
[1:25:18] living I thought God won't destroy us
[1:25:20] God is a god of love God loves us well
[1:25:23] what happen happened hey God is a god of
[1:25:26] love and
[1:25:27] mercy and redemption and forgiveness
[1:25:29] he's those things he's also a god of
[1:25:31] judgment and wrath never forget that
[1:25:34] part of him too you got to take the
[1:25:36] whole character of God you know when
[1:25:39] Paul said Jesus Christ is same yesterday
[1:25:41] today and forever he's saying God is a
[1:25:43] being not the way he appears but himself
[1:25:45] what he loves what he hates it doesn't
[1:25:48] change right does not change amen that's
[1:25:52] right so now
[1:25:54] this is this brother Braham is in God of
[1:25:56] this evil age he says God is a good god
[1:26:00] you're in his holy church why you cannot
[1:26:02] die but God said you would that settles
[1:26:04] it see him today oh just belong to
[1:26:07] church it ain't what you do or this or
[1:26:10] that or the other just come to church be
[1:26:12] a good member cutting your hair that's
[1:26:14] nonsense wearing shorts putting on p uh
[1:26:17] uh paint and going to dance this little
[1:26:18] bear once in a while won't hurt you as
[1:26:20] long as you don't indulge in it frankly
[1:26:22] I wish your children would take it
[1:26:24] so that you could learn whether you
[1:26:26] liked it or not there he is the God of
[1:26:28] this evil age see it sound it sounds all
[1:26:31] right it sounds all right but it's
[1:26:33] actually what he's saying there he is
[1:26:35] you
[1:26:36] know there it is he says there he is the
[1:26:40] God of this evil age this evil age God
[1:26:42] is a good god I've heard that so much
[1:26:44] till I get sick God is a God of Justice
[1:26:47] he ain't no Doty grandpa that can be
[1:26:50] pushed around and his grandkids don't
[1:26:52] have any sin he's a god of justice and
[1:26:55] Holiness he proved it in the Garden of
[1:26:57] Eden by his first children you cross
[1:26:59] that line of one of his words you're
[1:27:01] dead same thing applies today and notice
[1:27:04] he preached that kind of a scientific
[1:27:06] social educated Progressive gospel to
[1:27:08] Eve and Adam's bride believed it and she
[1:27:11] and he has succeeded in filling the
[1:27:14] soall bride of Christ the Church of the
[1:27:16] second I mean the Church of the second
[1:27:18] Adam with the same arguments that's
[1:27:20] right oh it's not for God God is too
[1:27:23] good to do it why as long as you go to
[1:27:25] church if thou believeth he says the
[1:27:27] devil believes not make believes but he
[1:27:30] actually believes he's not saved he says
[1:27:33] but he
[1:27:34] believes he tells the second bride or
[1:27:38] the second Adam's bride the same as he
[1:27:40] told the first now Divine Healing
[1:27:42] there's no such thing we can prove that
[1:27:45] been a case proved and this baptism in
[1:27:48] jesus' name now don't you realize that
[1:27:51] I'm the authority of the church he says
[1:27:53] we SLE that at I Rome when them three
[1:27:56] unclean spirits went out of the Dragon
[1:27:57] the false prophets and so forth we
[1:28:00] believe there's a trinity of gods over
[1:28:01] for goodness sake that's as Heathen as
[1:28:03] can be don't you ever come before God
[1:28:05] with such a thing as that try to stand
[1:28:07] in his presence oh it don't make any
[1:28:09] difference if you're baptized in the
[1:28:11] titles of father son Holy Ghost what
[1:28:13] difference does it make it made so much
[1:28:15] difference until Paul commanded a bunch
[1:28:18] of Baptists that they had to be
[1:28:19] re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:22] before the Holy Ghost could ever come on
[1:28:23] them them and also caused the apostles
[1:28:25] to scream out and said if an angel come
[1:28:28] from heaven and preach anything else let
[1:28:30] him be cursed sure it makes a difference
[1:28:32] he says oh
[1:28:33] my but you see what has happened now is
[1:28:36] there is truth and error has separated
[1:28:39] itself out like this as time has gone by
[1:28:42] it's just gone out like this and
[1:28:44] truth you know error is all people know
[1:28:47] yes and they have this concept of God
[1:28:49] that they're born with you know and and
[1:28:52] so they try and worship God that way and
[1:28:55] then when anything come and the
[1:28:56] scripture to back it up but it's an idol
[1:28:59] I'm just going to be flat today it's
[1:29:00] just an idol and then when truth comes
[1:29:02] way it sounds extreme but the truth is
[1:29:05] right down the middle amen the truth is
[1:29:07] right down the middle you when brother
[1:29:09] brah was preaching these things he
[1:29:10] wasn't trying to pull you know he wasn't
[1:29:12] leaning too far one way to try and bring
[1:29:14] the back in the middle he was right down
[1:29:15] the middle amen God God built him that
[1:29:18] way you take Elijah in the first first
[1:29:21] time Elijah was here they had the
[1:29:23] prophets of B they had their altar they
[1:29:25] were doing all kinds of things and it
[1:29:26] said and the altar of the Lord was was
[1:29:28] fallen down right so he he rebuilt the
[1:29:31] altar that the real worship could come
[1:29:34] and and every time Elijah comes that's
[1:29:36] just how it works and that's why when he
[1:29:38] came at the end time he rebuilt the true
[1:29:40] worship of God that everything God is we
[1:29:43] can know amen and that very God can come
[1:29:46] and live in us it's not just a form of
[1:29:47] worship but that living one comes in US
[1:29:50] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen that's
[1:29:53] just how Elijah operates he rebuilds the
[1:29:56] true approach to God and it's not a fear
[1:29:58] that drives us there it's a love am me
[1:30:01] when he talked about the three pulls to
[1:30:02] get the bride the third pull would get
[1:30:04] the bride it wasn't a push it wasn't a
[1:30:07] kick a head over the head it was a pull
[1:30:09] amen amen a draw you should be drawn
[1:30:12] hallelujah amen a drawn towards God like
[1:30:14] more than anything else in this earth
[1:30:17] Hallelujah my goodness amen so it's not
[1:30:20] a you
[1:30:21] know he he just preached WR down what
[1:30:24] the Bible
[1:30:25] said and we have to be willing now what
[1:30:28] do you want to accept because when truth
[1:30:30] comes it's never pretty amen Jesus
[1:30:33] wasn't a pretty guy John the Baptist
[1:30:35] sure wasn't a pretty Gody how many times
[1:30:37] did he ever bath in his life maybe this
[1:30:40] many I don't know he's in the wilderness
[1:30:41] most of his life Hallelujah but here
[1:30:43] came here come the one to prepare the
[1:30:45] way of the Lord amen amen and that was
[1:30:47] truth and when he said you Generation of
[1:30:49] Vipers that was just how it was
[1:30:51] hallelujah amen and the elect could see
[1:30:54] hey this is actually what those people
[1:30:55] are and they receive the Lamb of God yes
[1:30:57] amen hallelujah that's why when Paul
[1:31:00] came he said don't come with an enticing
[1:31:02] man's Wisdom and all these things but in
[1:31:04] loneliness and meekness and in the power
[1:31:06] of God that you can put your confidence
[1:31:08] not in me as a man but you can put your
[1:31:10] confidence in the Living God hallelujah
[1:31:12] hallelujah hey hey didn't look pretty he
[1:31:15] comes a GU he's got this Affliction in
[1:31:16] his body he has only got one Cod he's
[1:31:18] poor and every jail in the country knows
[1:31:21] where he is cuz he's been there when he
[1:31:22] preaches and you all that you know he
[1:31:24] doesn't have such a great reputation but
[1:31:26] there was the first church age messenger
[1:31:29] and that Ministry brother R says every
[1:31:30] true Ministry pattern itself after Paul
[1:31:34] hallelujah amen amen so there we are so
[1:31:37] Hallelujah truth is never pretty to the
[1:31:40] eye but it's truth amen amen so now also
[1:31:46] what we have I want to I want to go into
[1:31:50] maybe just just shift a little bit we
[1:31:52] have you know Satan you know I know I'm
[1:31:54] sure it's obvious to you that you know
[1:31:56] he wanted to be worshiped this is how he
[1:31:59] does it he kicks the truth out they
[1:32:01] receive ear and all these things but I
[1:32:03] want to show you another thing I want to
[1:32:05] go
[1:32:06] to uh I want to just just talk about
[1:32:10] music very briefly if you don't mind now
[1:32:14] brother Brown makes this
[1:32:16] statement and he says
[1:32:19] it so this isn't ashamed of him
[1:32:23] now here's a
[1:32:24] because man there's more
[1:32:26] prophecies you know than just in the
[1:32:28] Bible but whatever brother R prophesies
[1:32:30] is in the scripture
[1:32:32] yeah now he says this an ashamed of him
[1:32:36] he says don't be ashamed of him in this
[1:32:38] generation sinful perplexed the last
[1:32:41] generation that'll ever be on the earth
[1:32:42] this sinful adulterous full of all
[1:32:45] putrified SS all everything that's been
[1:32:47] decent has become indecent National
[1:32:50] politics filth nations are are broke up
[1:32:52] way back in the jungles of Africa on
[1:32:54] Safari Hunters they had to take a high
[1:32:57] powerered radio to hear Alvis Presley
[1:32:59] Pon and them guys with that rock and
[1:33:02] roll and twist and the natives trying to
[1:33:05] see them act along jerking their head
[1:33:08] acting like that the natives stood and
[1:33:11] looked at that but you see they're not
[1:33:13] Americans like Pat bur and Alvis Presley
[1:33:15] and Ricky Nelson and them guys are they
[1:33:18] they're not judases of that type it's a
[1:33:22] spirit and the spirit is not only in
[1:33:24] America it spread itself all over the
[1:33:27] world to bring them to the battle of
[1:33:30] Armageddon so he saying because religion
[1:33:34] but then the devil also uses other ways
[1:33:36] to to make sure his his what he wants to
[1:33:39] do is me yes because
[1:33:43] remember it says it says in Revelation
[1:33:46] 16 I saw three unclean spirits like
[1:33:49] frogs come out of the mouth of the
[1:33:50] dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast
[1:33:52] out of the mouth of the false prophet
[1:33:53] and they are the spirits of devils
[1:33:55] working miracles which go forth into the
[1:33:57] kings of the earth and the whole world
[1:33:59] to gather them to the Battle of that
[1:34:01] great day of God Almighty he says behold
[1:34:04] I come as a thief blessed is he that WTH
[1:34:07] and keepeth his garments lest he walk
[1:34:09] naked and and they see his shame and
[1:34:12] they and he gathered them together into
[1:34:14] a place called in the Hebrew tongue
[1:34:17] armagen he's saying now he's going to
[1:34:19] gather everyone to this place for this
[1:34:21] final final battle
[1:34:24] and brother BR saying now is that this
[1:34:26] spirit because music music is not
[1:34:29] entertainment m music is to call God or
[1:34:33] Satan that is that is just all music's
[1:34:35] for it's not it's not to be entertaining
[1:34:37] it calls two powers and whatever music
[1:34:40] you play or call whatever power you want
[1:34:43] and it's not even about the type of
[1:34:44] music that's played it's the spirit
[1:34:46] motiv motivating the ones playing it yes
[1:34:50] so he said that this this spirit will
[1:34:52] spread over all the Earth to bring the
[1:34:54] people to
[1:34:55] Armageddon now music is a lot more
[1:34:57] powerful than I think we realize you as
[1:34:59] I said it's it's to call God or Satan on
[1:35:01] the scene and Elisha when he's standing
[1:35:04] before you know the king of you know
[1:35:06] King King Jehoshaphat and then there's
[1:35:08] another king there you know and and they
[1:35:11] want to see which way they should go in
[1:35:13] the battle and Elisha says you know he
[1:35:17] says he says as the Lord liveth before
[1:35:19] whom I stand surely were it not that I
[1:35:21] regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the
[1:35:23] king of of Judah I would not look toward
[1:35:26] thee nor see thee speaking to the evil
[1:35:27] King but he says but bring me a Minstrel
[1:35:29] he said the minstrel began to play in
[1:35:31] the hand of God Came Upon him and he
[1:35:33] prophesied and then David the same way
[1:35:35] when he would play that evil spirit
[1:35:37] would leave Saul amen and that's and
[1:35:39] then also there was another king in in
[1:35:42] in 2 Chronicles and when he went into
[1:35:45] battle when he was fighting against
[1:35:47] three nations he sent singers before the
[1:35:50] Army amen he sent singers before the
[1:35:53] battle was join joined and they won a
[1:35:55] great Victory there that's why we sing
[1:35:58] before we hear the preaching of the word
[1:36:00] that's why we sing because we're
[1:36:01] entering into a battle am mean where
[1:36:03] faith and doubt is set in Array and the
[1:36:05] devil's trying to withhold am mean the
[1:36:07] blessings of God and then we create an
[1:36:10] atmosphere Hallelujah then God descends
[1:36:12] amen that's why I always pray anoint the
[1:36:14] musicians amen amen anoint the singers
[1:36:17] amen that God can come down and and and
[1:36:19] he can do what he wants to do Hallelujah
[1:36:22] that's why we sing amen but but then you
[1:36:25] take that on the flip side if you if you
[1:36:27] sing for Satan he'll come sure is the
[1:36:30] world he'll come amen so we we must we
[1:36:34] must look now he uses the enemy uses
[1:36:37] music to spread his his anointing upon
[1:36:42] people and brother BR I know this is
[1:36:44] probably not all that positive but hey
[1:36:46] this is where we are you know brother B
[1:36:48] says I'm recognizing your day and and he
[1:36:50] recounts when he saw when he saw the
[1:36:52] preview of the right I'm sure you're all
[1:36:54] familiar with this but he saw you know
[1:36:57] he saw the first church come up all
[1:36:59] dressed Godly you know dressed as as
[1:37:01] Saints marching to the sound of the
[1:37:03] Gospel yes and then he saw the modern
[1:37:06] Church came up and it made him sick to
[1:37:08] the
[1:37:09] stomach and he and he felt like he just
[1:37:11] his his whole Ministry was a miserable
[1:37:13] failure he thought is this the best I
[1:37:15] can present they're all naked and
[1:37:17] dancing and all these things and they
[1:37:18] were they were they were marching to the
[1:37:20] tune of rock and roll and they being led
[1:37:22] by a witch
[1:37:24] now this and then after that then the
[1:37:27] bride came into to preview again so just
[1:37:29] as the first one came in the bride at
[1:37:32] the end will be exactly the same
[1:37:34] hallelujah hallelujah but then we have
[1:37:36] this now so this modern church so he's
[1:37:39] sing a
[1:37:40] vision but this is being lived out and I
[1:37:44] don't say this with any satisfaction of
[1:37:45] my soul that's for sure but this vision
[1:37:48] is being lived out
[1:37:49] today amen amen where people are being
[1:37:52] led by wi evil spirit and they're
[1:37:56] thinking they're worshiping God and
[1:37:58] they're doing it to the tune of rock and
[1:38:00] roll amen as I said it's not it's not
[1:38:03] necessarily the type of music that's
[1:38:04] played it's the spirit behind it
[1:38:05] motivating it so because that because
[1:38:08] you also you say well they worship Jesus
[1:38:10] Christ and say what is produced when you
[1:38:13] see the videos when you see the services
[1:38:15] online what do you see being produced in
[1:38:18] the people what is being produced is it
[1:38:21] the life of God is it the character he
[1:38:23] say well how can you just see the
[1:38:24] characteristics of God seeing photos and
[1:38:26] video you'll see it amen amen you are a
[1:38:29] light that's not you can't hide this
[1:38:31] light under a bushel it's put upon a
[1:38:32] hill everyone knows who you are they
[1:38:34] knew who Jesus was he didn't even say
[1:38:37] anything he just walked along have you
[1:38:39] come to torment us before the time he
[1:38:42] didn't tell this is me this is what I do
[1:38:43] this is all you know give him a business
[1:38:45] card he just he just was was living
[1:38:48] life same thing with a Believer today
[1:38:52] you can see a believer amen that that
[1:38:55] Spirit you know you you see a you feel a
[1:38:57] welcoming Spirit things they you know
[1:38:59] how they not near see what they say but
[1:39:01] what they do the characteristic of
[1:39:03] Christ being lived out amen so we see
[1:39:06] that he when he's talking about this
[1:39:08] he's talking about prophecy and it and
[1:39:11] it's being it's coming to its fullness
[1:39:13] in this
[1:39:14] day amen amen so this is but you say
[1:39:19] well they get they you know God you know
[1:39:22] people actually yet God does things for
[1:39:25] them in those kind of services and and
[1:39:26] they feel you say you feel the love of
[1:39:29] God when you hear the
[1:39:31] music now music is an emotional thing
[1:39:34] now this is not talking about Taste of
[1:39:36] music I like this I don't like this it's
[1:39:37] not what this is about it's talking
[1:39:40] about now music is an emotional thing Y
[1:39:43] and if and see that's where the
[1:39:45] Deception comes in they say what a
[1:39:47] wonderful service that was you can feel
[1:39:49] just a you know just you get people cry
[1:39:52] and they praise God all these things and
[1:39:55] they think they're worshiping God
[1:39:56] because they mentioned Jesus in the song
[1:39:59] yes but look at the remember the singing
[1:40:03] goes before The Battle Before the word
[1:40:05] comes amen and what does their message
[1:40:11] produce is it this in flesh or is it
[1:40:14] something else there's only
[1:40:16] two y amen amen you say well I'm so
[1:40:19] moved when I hear the songs absolutely
[1:40:22] but you got to be be careful because
[1:40:25] that that spirit is said to go into the
[1:40:26] Earth and gather to the battle of
[1:40:29] Armageddon we're not called to a battle
[1:40:31] of ared friends we're not called to go
[1:40:33] there we're not called to fight am me
[1:40:35] we're called to go up amen that is that
[1:40:39] there's exactly what we're called to do
[1:40:41] he says in the same message he says they
[1:40:43] act like that he says whatever Nation
[1:40:45] they're from Africa India whatever it's
[1:40:47] a vulgar stuff it's spread all over the
[1:40:49] Earth by just one man started it so has
[1:40:52] the gospel in the power of Mighty God
[1:40:54] has spread around the world and the
[1:40:56] separation time is now taking place when
[1:40:59] God is calling a bride and the devil's
[1:41:00] calling a church let me be part of the
[1:41:02] Bride amen he says and there's a prophet
[1:41:06] standing here he's not trying to be
[1:41:07] Sensational he says this is just how it
[1:41:09] is this is what I've seen in an unseen
[1:41:11] realm and this is what's going to come
[1:41:13] to pass and just as he prophesied of
[1:41:15] other things coming to pass this is this
[1:41:17] is already in full but thing is we were
[1:41:20] born amen you know when he was standing
[1:41:22] upon the Earth the judgments of God
[1:41:24] hadn't yet you know you come to 1964
[1:41:26] says pick up the rock there's a great
[1:41:29] you know uh was it good Friday
[1:41:31] earthquake in Alaska almost sinks Alaska
[1:41:33] he says judgment striking the West Coast
[1:41:36] before that the Judgment had Begin to
[1:41:38] Fall he say well we're looking for a
[1:41:40] Great Tribulation it eases in it's
[1:41:43] already we're not in it yet because we
[1:41:44] don't see the Great Tribulation but the
[1:41:46] judgments are being to be poured out
[1:41:47] more more more more more then we're
[1:41:49] taking out of the way that comes in its
[1:41:50] fullness Hallelujah and we're born when
[1:41:53] the judgments of God are already falling
[1:41:55] upon the Earth yes and we think this is
[1:41:57] normal this is not normal that's not how
[1:42:00] Society was I'm not talking about the
[1:42:02] more technology it's just this is not
[1:42:04] how Society was amen what has happened
[1:42:07] we're living in the Judgment time where
[1:42:09] pre-tribulation is already
[1:42:11] here amen and then and then people here
[1:42:14] brother say he was so hard he was so
[1:42:16] polar opposite of today of course he was
[1:42:19] cuz what is a prophet of God that God
[1:42:21] was revealing himself to but to he
[1:42:22] wasn't living the time of judgment amen
[1:42:25] amen but then we have to you know I
[1:42:28] trust you're like
[1:42:29] Rahab Rahab was living in a time of
[1:42:32] judgment the whole nation was condemned
[1:42:35] but when she heard when she heard the
[1:42:37] testimony of what God did said I want
[1:42:40] Mercy amen hallelujah and she got her
[1:42:42] and her whole house under that Mercy
[1:42:45] amen and then when the whole place came
[1:42:47] down amen they walked out without a
[1:42:49] scratch Hallelujah and they and she
[1:42:51] married Salon amen became part of Israel
[1:42:55] came forth in the resurrection
[1:42:56] hallelujah hallelujah I trust you're in
[1:42:58] the same same condition amen living in
[1:43:01] the judgments of God but you hear a
[1:43:02] testimony of what God has done
[1:43:05] hallelujah she never met Joshua never
[1:43:07] saw Moses was never there in Egypt she
[1:43:09] just heard about it she said I don't
[1:43:12] want to die with everyone else because
[1:43:15] she knew that that God that poured out
[1:43:17] judgment was also a god of Mercy
[1:43:19] hallelujah hallelujah she knew the whole
[1:43:21] C all the rest of the just saw a god of
[1:43:24] judgment coming amen but she saw there
[1:43:27] was Mercy in this one that pouring out
[1:43:29] judgment there the same thing with the
[1:43:31] bride of Christ we don't see judgment we
[1:43:33] see Mercy I trust you see Mercy say Lord
[1:43:36] I want your mercy amen and then so now
[1:43:39] God is calling a bride Hallelujah the
[1:43:42] devil's calling a church amen he the
[1:43:45] devil wants to be worshiped but he we
[1:43:47] will not worship him I trust you know
