portion in this day and father we just want to commit the service into your hands further anoint your word one more time to every life please in Jesus Christ they might ask amen amen thank you brother Isaac thank you musicians amen good morning everyone god bless you all amen praise the Lord let's go to John chapter 19 and then we're going to and then we're going to go to Hebrews 10 then fire this thing up and burning nowhere they said they couldn't make it this morning but this is they're gonna watch it later later today so we just continue but but more Spanish amen praise the Lord Amen said John 19 in verses 28 to 30 it says here and after this see so this is our Lord Jesus hanging on the cross after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst now there was a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when Jesus therefore had received the big received the vinegar he said it is finished he bowed his head and gave up the ghost amen and this just actually you may be seated this morning the prints of the Lord now if you've got your Bibles handy let's just turn to Hebrews chapter 10 as well but I want to if I could take a a subject this morning Jesus says it is finished do you believe it it has finished do you have confidence and in the sacrifice of his blood do you really know what he's done for you it is finished I mean he paid it all we don't have to do anything to merit our salvation it is finished do you have full confidence because liberal and and legalistic people they don't have full confidence that it's finished amen if you want you know if you're on both sides of the road and not down the middle you don't have full confidence that it's finished I mean so this is the question now do you fully have you fully do you fully believe it's done because he didn't just say idle words when he said it's finished I paid it in full I mean I don't have to pay any interest off it's fully paid I mean the redemption for all all who whosoever will that will believe in me Amen that have been predestinated ordained amen to to be made in my image to go in a rapture heaven live live eternally it's done it's finished it's paid in full hallelujah sir Hebrews 10 and 1 it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come now I'm going to speak quite a bit out of the book of Hebrews this morning because the Hebrews they came out of they came out of the Old Testament traditions of believing the law and things but they were stuck from coming out of the old ways and coming into Christ and and the Apostle Paul he contrasts many times the Oasis you know the blood of Jesus Christ is greater than the blood of bulls and goats the Ministry of Jesus Christ as our high priest is greater than a natural high priest it's greater than just a natural priesthood and he any contrast these things all the time through the book of Hebrews and he any calls of people let us go unto perfection I mean let us run this race let us go beyond the camp under him bearing his reproach he's calling the people to go fully amen into Christ and the reason he has to speak to us to the Hebrews is because when Paul was writing this letter there was the blindness coming on the Jewish people and because the Gentiles were coming in and now we've come back with yo we've come full-circle again but instead of blindness coming on the Jewish people their eyes are coming open they're in their promised land I mean they've been called back your Israel is a nation for the first time in two-and-a-half thousand years it's been a nation for about 70 years now amen and because God ordained that they would be gathered back into that land because it's still three and a half years of grace for the Jewish people but as the blindness came on them that we would receive amen eternal life now a blindness is coming upon the Gentiles Alleluia but I believe by His grace we will not be caught in that blindness I mean so now but there's got to be a contrasting because you've got to see what we're under is greater than then a denominational idea what is what we are under is greater than then what has been in the past I mean because because they you know I was thinking I was praying last night Lord made the fool may these may may these things anchor into every soul the magnitude of it I mean when we read the scripture it's so easy just to skip over things and oh that's nice and that's why but the magnitude I mean because those words have weight I mean they have that you know there's a potency behind them and I pray may the magnitude of these things I mean really thinking to every soul because if it really does you you'll just go out of this place happy I mean because what comes of goes amen you know this Eastern religions they talk about obtaining Nirvana and some spiritual plane and different things but I'll tell you what if these things anchor into your soul doesn't what comes or goes good times bad times you'll be in more than just a Nirvana State I mean but you'll be rejoicing night and day hallelujah because this world is a vapor it's going to pass away I mean we'll go you know if the Lord should tarry 70 years most of us will be in a grave someplace and just a memory to the future generation where will we be where will we be I mean but if you know where you're going hey come what may glory there come a time when time is no more and I'll still be hallelujah amen so now for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect so it couldn't perfect the people they had eight so if they brought a sacrifice for example they stole or they did whatever and they bought a sacrifice God accepted that sacrifice on their behalf but it couldn't the desire that caused them to say steal or cheat or lie or whatever it was that desire was still in the amount of the sacrifice was offered but the sacrifice was accepted in their place so it could never make so you know you think about the Old Testament how much blood was shed how many how many Bulls were killed how many lambs how many goats how many we are whatever the offerings were there was a lot of blood there's a lot of sacrifice there's a you know there was a lot of offerings I think I think if we really went back into that time and we and we observe maybe just a day there with the tabernacle or maybe the temple and you saw all the blood that was shed and over death you know we would probably be shocked by by the magnitude of it but all the shedding of blood and all the killing of animals it didn't change the people it didn't do them any they were they were accepted because the sacrifice was accepted but didn't change them I mean it doesn't change them now verse 2 for then would they have not ceased to be offered because if it made them perfect they wouldn't have to offer them anymore hallelujah isn't that right Amen because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscious of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year because the condition that the people were born with we were all born with a fallen nature I mean that's why that's why just be a good person doesn't get you to heaven because if we're all born in a fallen state how can we get out of it by our own good works because our very core our being has fallen amen I couldn't you know I couldn't die for you because because I'm falling to begin with my blood can't help you doesn't matter how much I love you how much I care about you how much you want to see you up in heaven my blood doesn't do any good because I'm falling to begin with I'm in and an animal can howl because there's a law form of life amen y'all can't change you can't help you that's why we needed one to come that's why we needed God becoming a man hallelujah he has made exactly he was a man he was flesh and blood like us he was fully God but it was fully man he had to be fully God because only God could fulfill his own law only God could meet the requirement of his own law I mean but he had to become a man to do it hallelujah so now I know I trust these things really anchor in because I think really when you realize not hear just hear jesus paid it all he's paid my ticket he's offered me a pardon he's offered me is pardoning grace just receive my my offering and by faith he say lord I receive it doesn't have to be a great big thing just from your heart Lord I receive what you've done for me your your life will never be the same all the struggles all the well what about this and what about this is what about this you won't worry about those things you just walk hey man now for it's not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrificing and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou has prepared me and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure the instant I lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will O God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither had us pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said then said he lo I come to do thy will O God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified wherefore the holy spirit also is a witness to us that after that he said had said before this is the Covenant which I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I'll put my laws into their hearts and in their minds and I will and I'll write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now we remission of visas there is no more offering for sin amen now this is what he's talking you know you got to say he stuck now I know I probably say it every Sunday but I really want you to think about it he's talking about me when Paul is describing the worshiper has no more conscious of sin he's been perseveres since Jesus gave himself for his body was offered as a as an offering for me he's talking about me Pelin i've been purged I have no more conscience the things I once said the nature I had that that made me sin and maybe committed altar in Lyons steel and but even more in cheating selfishness and all those things temper and whatever more that nature's gone I mean because I accepted that our offering was given a sacrifice was given hallelujah now in the Old Testament they offered lambs a lamb was a sacrifice now lamb has a nature a lamb is a very innocent little gentle kind of creature now you could be full of Wrath and you could offer that lamb in the Old Testament but you'd be full of wrath and still have a nature that wasn't like the lamb in the Old Testament I mean but Jesus was the Lamb of God that came to take away the sin of the world hallelujahs he was a lamb and so now when you offer when you accept his sacrifice now when you truly accept it not just mentally when you truly accept that by faith now the life that was in him comes into you and changes your nature that's when you know you're really accepted it not just mentally not just emotionally but you really accept this offering it changes your nature because the life that was in him comes unto you hallelujah and that's why now the worshiper has no more conscious of sins I mean because as nature of her nature's been changed hallelujah so the desires that we had that we we realized we were lost and undone amen but when he when you accept what he has done his life comes unto you and you're changed amen it's just like a thing I've used the illustration before but just like a man who's in debt and he he cannot he cannot pay his debt off and and he got himself in the debt and then a rich man comes along and says I'll pay off your debt and now the man in debt can accept the rich man's money to pay off the debt but he can fall into debt again and that's like being justified by faith I meant you can you can accept Jesus's pardoning grace he can pay off your debt but then if your nature has not changed you'll fall into that same debt again right so a man who's in debt and his dick gets paid off if his nature doesn't change who is the nature like the rich man he can fall into debt again but if he seems the nature of the rich man into him he'll be able to use his money wisely and he won't fall into debt hey man it's the same thing was right hallelujah now we I just want to read read this that's one brother Barrowman why where do you come from there you go back because it's a creation it had to come from a creator you have to make it and therefore it went all the way back to its crater that coloring that was in that ink the swing of it can never return again now God sing the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin he never manufactured he created a chemical in the blood of Jesus Christ amen that sin once confessed you don't even bridge that chasm there was a chasm between you and God you don't even bridge that chasm you take the chasm completely away I mean you know that there was a gulf between God and man I mean when you accept his offering that chasm was not bridged its annihilated I mean the Bible says he breaks down has broken down the middle wall of partition between you and him hallelujah and God don't even know you take the chasm completely awake God don't even know that you ever sinned that's right he said he put them in the sea of forgetfulness to remember them no more at all against you then men and women stand in the presence of God as sons and daughters of God the very nature of God is in their hearts where is the church today brothers what's happened to the church amen he's saying this is the condition you're in and you got to say he's talking about me hallelujah because remember Jesus went to Calvary with with his sin upon him your sin upon himself amen he died as a sinner he went to hell as a sinner he went to hell in your place I mean that you don't need you don't need to go to that place I'm in but he rose triumphantly over hell days in the grave hallelujah so he took your judgment memory took your judgment I mean the wrath of God to you know the rest that was poured out upon him upon his flesh was the rest you should have received I but he took the rest I'm in Amazon Laura pod himself hallelujah he took your place I'm in that you don't need to take judgment that's why the broad doesn't go through the tribulation I mean the tribulation is a purging time I mean of nature and the fullest virgin Israel all these things we don't need any more purging I mean because he took out purging that day on Calvary probably because we were we received the fullness of a sacrifice have you not you say yes he's talking about me I received the fullness of his blood maybe not just a part of it but the fullness of it hallelujah so we don't need to go through a tribulation we don't need a purging I mean we've been purged he took out purging he took our punishment he took the rest we should have received hallelujah amen and he paid it in full glory to God amen any any a took away he took away the chasm you know think about these things nothing between my soul and my Savior nothing between hallelujah there's nothing between now this speak to the rock 1960 this is brother Burnham and pray God how we thank you that we can speak to you we're so thankful to be on speaking terms the blood of Jesus Christ puts us in this condition hallelujah I mean the blood of Jesus Christ who's received as atonement who's received his blood amen the blood of Jesus Christ because many times we think he's so far away who's been in that boat for a little bit he's so far away he know he doesn't hear my prayer but the blood of Jesus Christ puts us in speaking terms it puts us in this condition I mean so if you've received Peru and I'm just going to say it again who's received it if you've received it I mean his blood puts you on speaking terms I mean that he speaks to you you speak to him hallelujah have a relationship I mean there's no gulf between you and God I mean us actually you know God speaks to God speaks amen and and we know if it's his voice if it's according to his word but he speaks - he wants to speak to us and he wants to walk with us he wants have a relationship with us he wants to be involved in our life I mean cuz he's interested in you who me yes you hallelujah he's interested in all of us doesn't matter how big we think we are how little we think we are he's interested in your everyday life I mean you've had a hot day tell him about it you've had a good day tell him about it I mean you've had just a shambles of a week tell him about it hallelujah he wants to know does he not amen he's paid it all the blood of Jesus Christ puts us in this condition I remember in the Old Testament the Old Testament the worshiper was not examined the worshiper was not examined when the worshiper I know I've said it before but I want this to really sink in when the when the worshiper brought an offering it was not the worshiper being examined that person was not brought into account they weren't even looked at the the work that the sacrifice was the only thing the priest looked at and if the sacrifice was accepted I mean then the worshiper was accepted hallelujah and that's all that mattered and here comes out our lamb our Lord Jesus I mean he was examined by the scribes and Pharisees his examined by Pilate and Pilate came to the conclusion I find no fault I find no fault in this man I mean he said I've examined the lamb I find no fault in this land and if the lamb was perfect without blemish then it could be sacrificed hallelujah so now Pilate did the examining I find no fault in this animal I find no fault in this sacrifice amen and then he was offered hallelujah he was offered his hand between heaven and earth honor on a cross and and the Bible says curse that is he that hangeth upon a tree I mean he has hung on a piece of tree I mean he became a curse for us hallelujah I'm so glad he became a curse for us I mean he took us he he he took our sin upon himself and he's hanging there between heaven and earth riding a covenant with the peoples of the world hallelujah and then he goes down and he takes your son down to hell he leaves her there he and he raises again hallelujah and then M&E comes he comes out of the tomb and then he speaks Mary this is Mary where have you taken him she says where what's going on see forget what's going on with him where she don't worry about things and this person this person this who cares where's he gone that's what she wanted to know where is he gone I mean and then he then she turns around and he says Mary and her eyes come open at you Lord you've yes you're resurrected here's my lamb is alive again hallelujah but then he says now don't touch me I haven't ascended I mean I descended now I'm up hallelujah but I got to go my offering has to be I've got to take my blood into the presence of God amen I mean and then he has scenes now remember if the if the sacrifice is accepted the worship has accepted hallelujah very simple but very very great I mean so now he raises he goes up into him he comes back down Thomas is here with the disciples Thomas before the said well I won't believe unless I see all the see the holes in his hands and his feet and different things and then he appears but you're among them he says Thomas touch my hands touch me handle me handle me hallelujah and Thomas he sees my Lord and my god hallelujah why couldn't me touch them because the offering was given and it came back down hallelujah that was received I mean he so the lamb was received and if he's received your receiver unit worshipper aim interview by faith put your hands upon him how they said this is my lamb hello have you done that I mean because the Lambs been been received that means you're EC I mean the lamb was examined found without fault you say well I've got all kinds of folks don't worry about your folks he was the faultless one he was the one that was examined hallelujah amen so we shouldn't worry about ourselves what are you looking at go read the Old Testament it doesn't say now when the wish book brings the offering the worshipper will be sat down and had to fill out a questionnaire and you don't have to give an account before the priest doesn't say anything about that this is just a shadow that wasn't good born into account it was the lamb amen now it season in Hebrews 9 and 22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood without shedding of blood there's no remission because the life has to be given for a life and it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in heaven should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for the for Christ it's not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to to appear in the presence of God for us I mean for me amen I mean we're not alone in this walk I mean we have someone on our side hallelujah it says know yet that he should offer him that he should offer himself offer himself often as the high priest entered into the holy place are we there yes we are then that he suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment so Christ once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation now we could understand when people die they just don't sleep people are conscious somewhere and you see it in the book of Revelation there's the souls under the altar and we see it's a symbolic book and they're crying out how long will will you wait till you to you avenge us and that's not the Christians that's the Jews crying out for a revenge because their eye for an eye tooth for a tooth but they're actually in that place that waiting place calling out when you go to avenge us there they're conscious I meant there they're not asleep like we fall asleep but not aware of things going on they're crying out when are you going to avenge us so now that's just that's just one group of people and then Jesus tells the parable of the rich man and Lazarus Lazarus you know went to Abraham's bosom which is paradise the rich friend went to hell they're both conscious of where they were amen they're both they're both conscious of where they were and so now if that is just people how much more how much more God made flesh amen God is not sleeping he's not just having a rest someplace I mean but he is alive he is awake amen he is conscious of what's going on upon the earth is conscious of what he's what is happening in your life amen and it's so wonderful because in the Old Testament you know people were you know if they if they did the same that did the send more than once a year they were killed without mercy that was and it was it was a harsh year the law is a harsh thing and now so judgment was always given you know as a very harsh thing but in this case now the the judge what it was isn't just our judge but he became our attorney I mean because of the court case right and so our judge who was going to condemn us to hell became our eternally as Jesus Christ the man of Galilee amen and then so our judge became our attorney the case was dismissed amen because he held up the evidence of his blood hallelujah everything that was held against us there's a reason the devil's called the accuser of the Brethren I mean because he takes you know he just he just goes back in the video of your life and he presses play and he's got it indexed at different times look at what they did look at what they didn't look all they do look at man here did this from their mother and this from their father and this temper problem from their grandfather and different things and he's trying to you know and he and he's the accuser and he's accusing you I mean yeah he's telling God about everything you did wrong because he knows that God is a as as a god of his word amen and he has a law and a law has to have a penalty otherwise it means nothing I mean so God's law has a penalty and he's the accuser of the Brethren saying look at this they did this and they this and they thought this and they said listen this is what they did and this is what they're born worth they were falling to begin with but then the judge became our attorney amen and he took his own blood and he said this is actually the real evidence I mean this is the real evidence not everything that they have done but the real evidence is my blood I mean because they've accepted my offering and his blood doesn't just cover over your sin and it wipes it away it takes it from us hallelujah so he became our attorney I think you know God you know brother Branham said once he said he thought God hated him was angry with him not hated him was angry with him but Jesus loved them but they come to find out that one in the same person amen so sometimes we think God is God God is angry with us he's not angry with us and in the heart of God was expressed in Jesus Christ I mean he says I want to show these people I can't charter some invisible spirit that covers all time and space I'm in but I have to become a man because I want to show them exactly what who I really am and how I feel towards Adam's fallen race I mean I want to express my love to to two people I mean that they would really know this is my heart I mean that they wouldn't misunderstand me they wouldn't think that they just that that I'm just angry with them but then I love them hallelujah you know many times many times I asked the Lord Lord I want the people to know your heart I mean because if they really know this is how you really feel because sometimes we can you know we can express ourselves outwardly and we're not fully expressing what we feel and people can misunderstand it amen you know you can be full of well either wrath that you can be angry or you can be full of love and people can misunderstand now those are two extremes but I'll just use the love for the example really you can be full of love and you're and you want to show your love say to your children you want to just show it to them but somehow from here to here it somehow gets kind of filtered or stuck or something and you can't fully Express you know so you come into the presence of God and you want to jump of your skin and you want to shout and you're so thankful and it's just you know if you could only take how you're feeling on the inside and fully express it I mean people would look at you but differently maybe and there's nothing wrong with shouting and dancing you know you know brother Baron there was a woman at his Tabernacle when he'd stop preaching Billy Paul gives a testimony she has tie swing your handbag around and then she'd get real happy and she'd let it go across the church hallelujah no he never he never rebuked her for that because that was under the anointing that was actually in order you say that's not an order that's crazy no that was that was God expressing himself through one of his children I mean that's why you say well that's kind of different but if it's done and the spirit it's fine because God caused his spirit keeps order Amen it's not what we used to do all this stuff hallelujah but now but she was expressing that's how she felt must have I want to express how glory she is Alleluia and it's the same thing with us I want to finally I could really express how I feel and you tried it but sometimes you think no it's just not and in words fail you and you know finally I could you know and there's the same with God you know he wants his heart to be known he wants you to know this is how I really feel about you this is what I think my thoughts towards you as this I mean that you're not a downtrodden person in my sight you notice straggling believer in my sight and me not lost and undone in my sight I mean but I gave myself I fully gave myself for you I mean I I poured myself out I mean in your place hallelujah and I've allowed you to be gathered I mean to hear my voice holy that you'd fall in love with me I mean that you had no the that you're not a slave to the enemy I mean you know some downtrodden third-rate citizen of some country whatever you think you are I mean you know you know we we this is me we get sick of our own humanity we think why do I have to be built this way and you get frustrated why am I like this but you got to come to peace with it God made you that way God doesn't make a mistake God knew what he was doing when he made you hallelujah God made you a certain way well why is my character being formed this way God allowed it to be formed that way hallelujah isn't that right and but he wants you to know you know it's more than just he doesn't accept you based on your personality there's no merit of you it's not your intelligence or your personality or you make people laugh and I need someone to make people laugh and heaven and the yo-yoed fitten or whatever you're very thoughtful and kind that's why you're going to come to heaven it has nothing to do with it Amen but he saw you before the foundation of the world and he says this one's going to come this one is part of me this is my child I mean and I and and heaven I cannot exist without them hallelujah cannot exist just like Adam I mean when the serpent beguiled the gold even the serpent wasn't a snake until after thee after the curse I mean after the judgment but when the serpent beguiled Eve I mean Adam now she was deceived Adam was not deceived but Adam knew I cannot live without my wife I cannot live with the feminine part of me I cannot continue another day I'm in her life was in jeopardy Halloween because of just God will destroy her amen that's why he became one with her hallelujah that's why put his life in her all say it that way amen that because Adam knew that God could not destroy a part of me because I'm his son hallelujah he times that by a few infinity billion billions a few zeros on the end that's how God feels about you he says I can't I can't exist without this one I mean they're part of me does this mean something to you I mean he can't he can't exist what do you mean this great eternal being that never had a beginning will never have an end but yet he looks down at you and says I can't exist I can't exist without them they must come they must hear about me they must yield themselves to me I must express my love to them I must woo them to my side I must tell them that I love them I must tell them that they are my everything hallelujah you think I'm husband and wife I mean you look at your spouse though I trusted your everything I mean if the whole world ceases to be you'd be where are they I want them to be by my side I mean unless just human love how much more divine love I mean when divine love is projected hallelujah that's why this message is divine love probably that's why we're anointed with divine love I'm into the capstone this descended I mean which is Jesus Christ divine love hallelujah and he wants you to know that's why he can't live without you friends oh but I have no value he can't live without you I mean boys he was stirred up hallelujah he sees this Gentile this Gentile widow and his field colony and he looks at her and something says that's the one you marry it would have been a lot of girls that Israel would have wanted to marry Boas but something in him since that's the one I mean he couldn't rest hallelujah he couldn't reach I must marry this one I must redeemer hallelujah isn't that right that's exactly right it's a love story I mean it's written in the Bible that you would under that you would know this is God saying this is how I feel about you I will not rest until they fully redeemed I will not rest until there's a change in the body and then I will not rest till they're around my throne giving me praise hallelujah he will not rest and that's why now if he's purposed it in his heart that he's not going to rest he'll see you through he'll see you through the darkness he'll see you through the trials he'll see you through this dark world I mean he's not afraid he's a lamb 12 feet holy and the left can't go out amen the Bride of Christ cannot be stopped no devil can stop you are you think you're just prophet of speech I'm not positive speaking it's a reality Amen Jesus conquered hell death in the grave then he ascended on high and he went to his enemies become his footstool hallelujah he's waiting amen children I overcame now you overcome a member the same spreaders than me is gonna come into you amen and as I ever came you'll overcome hallelujah please amen everything we look at the universe we look at nebulas and stars and whatever more and we're amazed by it yes that's not his main well did he make all that he wanted to reveal himself to you through his creation science marbles over a blade of grass where did that come from and they have all their theories but God didn't put a blade of grass that's not the pinnacle of his creation why do you make this beautiful world to put you upon it I mean that he would reveal himself to you amen he wasn't sure he said it was good but when men came along it was very good hallelujah is very good now it's my children now they're upon the earth now I can have a relationship with them I mean if they're not just in my mind they'll be made material holy and now I can speak with them and I can walk with them and a fellowship with them and I can show my love to them hallelujah and now we're many thousands of years from the garden but the same thing still happens today I mean he he's excited you're upon the earth he's been watching many of our many of our forebears went through walls they went through famine they went through disease they went through all kinds of things plagues whatever more and God allowed them to be alive I mean that you would eventually be here hallelujah God was looking over them and if they made it Amen just naturally and here you are you've made it just naturally here I mean it's because God is excited no oh here he is here she is I've been waiting for this one I enjoyed walking with my children in the past but now here's another you know you enjoy hallelujah it's like when you have another child or now I can express myself to this one hallelujah yeah you know what I mean amen now well yeah you say little old me yes little old you he said well I haven't amounted to anything this that's not success in life the only thing if you want to be successful in life you meet her you meet him and you'll be successful I mean because as I said in the beginning you'll come a time when timers know more and where will you be you know maybe I'll talk about in a few Sunday's time but we were having fellowship this week Christine we're talking about it now when you're born your parents are there or even if you're an orphan there's someone need to look after you and then you get a bit older there's still somebody to look after you to hold your hand to walk you through life and then your teacher maybe teaches you and then maybe you go to you you know you change teachers but there's someone in there you know to teach you and to look after you in the classroom and then you go to university there's your lecturers and so on the you know someone eventually becomes your mentor and life amen but then there comes a time in life and then and then you get older and you get sick and you know the doctors are there to take you by the hand they're gonna look after you but there comes a time when the doctors say we cannot do any more they comes at time where they say we cannot help you anymore and then you're alone and what then what then now if you have the Lord he'll thank you from there because be because you go from them looking after you the doctors say we cannot do no more and then now you're drifting by yourself by yourself who's going to take you the rest of the way doesn't you could be under the best doctors and the best Hospital in the world with the most advanced techniques and everything but there comes a time where they say we cannot help you anymore who's going to take you the rest of the way when you go into a place called death who's going to take you who's there now if you know the Lord yes I've been waiting for this moment amen I was with you and your birth I was with you as a teenager even though even if you didn't know him back then I was with you as an arrow I was walking with you and he came a time and life right where I met you and you became real I mean where I became real to you we went from more than a story more than a tradition to the Living God hallelujah and then I've been walking with you all the days of your life then now it's time to come home my child hallelujah I'm glad he's here to take you by the hand I'm glad he's here to take me by the hand because we all got to step through that portal of death and even in a rapture he's gonna take us there if we if we go by the way of the grave or we go by the way of the body change he has to take he has to meet us and take us and the only way he'll meet us and take us there as if you meet him here I meant but you got to have confidence now this is blood enough to you this is sacrifice enough they meant what are you putting your hopes and trusts in because of your if you're putting your hopes and trust in him and yourself and your ambition and what you can do it's not gonna work because there has to come a time because man is very capable in his own strength to do to do certain things man has done incredible things Amen man has done with technology incredible things but there comes a time where man needs to realize I can't there's something I cannot do there's something I cannot do and that is to go from this world and to heaven by myself man cannot do it because man has fallen to begin with they can work it out they could have theology they can have religion they can have all kinds of things but without him the one who made all things to take the person by the hand and carried them from this world to the next world amen everything that that person has done in the world is in vain Azrael used to take the red here for sacrifice and sacrifice her upon the altar for a remission of sins for a year the sins of the guilty one was covered but that covering could not take away the desire for sin it was not a perfect offering it was a shadow until the real one came along so each year so each year the man would sacrifice in each year would come back because he still had the same desire to Sun the life of the animal atone for his sin but being animal blood that was shed and animal life that was given it could not come back upon the man if it had come back it would have not availed but when Christ the perfect substitute was given and his blood was shed then the life that was in Christ came back upon the repentant sinner and that life being the perfect life of Christ sinless and righteous then the guilty one could go free for he had no desire to sin the life of Jesus had come back upon him amen that is what it meant in Romans 8 and to the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death because he comes into you and this is life out of you amen now this you got to understand this is not just a mental concept an idea this is a reality it has to be a reality I mean but the Jews back there in the time of Jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice the blood of bulls and goats made nothing perfect it was once God's ordained method but now Christ having appeared in the flesh and by the shedding of his own blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect the Jews would not take that but but what about that Philadelphia Nagant yes to other ages too now the Philadelphia age was the age before the Lady of Syria and yes what about the other ages - did they really accept this reality in Christ no no sir he says this is brother Branham of the church age book even though Luther brought the truth of justification the Romish Church and its eastern counterpart the Orthodox Church still clung to works now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it is Christ or parish and is not even Christ and works it is Christ alone this age began the years of Arminianism that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood but it sings of nothing but the blood and my conduct I mean now I believe in good conduct of your save you'll do righteously if you have already we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus Plus that is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it's all God let his life be in me let his blood let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be a spirit that fills me let it be us word in my heart of my mouth let it be his stripes that heal me let it be Jesus and Jesus alone not of works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ as my life amen not believing in Christ is the reality now we can say all year they did that they did that but what about you what about you as it as it the reality of as offering or is it you and your own good works amen because member works is faith expressed we understand that but if you are trusting on what you do in some way to merit something from God oh I've done this therefore I can get favor from God I mean you are trusting and the blood and urine works because you think well I've done this I've done this now I believe in living a holy life I believe in being sanctified and consecrated to God I believe in holiness amen because if we believe the Bible we believe in holiness I mean we believe in in in a holiness standard of living but if we do it but it must be his life in you that does it amen and you say well I'm not sure well I'd rather side with what the Bible says then what the world does myself that's me personally but then you've got to think about it now if you say well I dress a certain way I press it in the mouth I listen to a certain amount I read a certain amount I witnesses and mouth therefore God has to do this for me then that's your own works amen you are relying on your own self to merit something from God that's why but you've got to understand it's not what you can mirrored amen churches say hallelujah I'm glad it's not what I can do but that doesn't mean we just sit back and watch the world go by and say well God's got to reveal it to me and I you know I'm not gonna do anything about it no that's just taking the other side I mean because you're actually still believing in your own works yeah because you say well because well maybe I'm contract mode yo contradicting myself but you're still adding to the blood because I he's got it yo I'm not going to do anything about it but you've got to surrender your own will amen so what do you you do you understand what I'm saying what do you do you have Christ as reality is it real to you or is it just a nice idea that makes you feel good we don't go by feelings I mean feelings the devil will take your feelings and whip you all the way around I mean if your feelings are contrary to the word you've got to throw your feelings aside amen but you got to understand it as salvation is of the Lord and if we believe salvation is of the Lord then our walk with God as of the Lord a mint because when I just saved once I'm saved I was saved over ten years ago but I'm still saved today he's still my Savior today I mean he's delivered me from a lot of things I mean he still delivers he keeps me free hallelujah are we really free this morning are we really free are we worried about what other people think and do and say whatever are we free Oh what is my reputation who cares about your reputation what is his reputation I'm not worried of my own reputation I mean I was a rotten dirty sinner to begin with amens His grace called me his grace washed me His grace redeem me I mean his grace ANCA fide me his grace filled me with His Holy Spirit that's all his doing I just gave myself to him hallelujah and that's all people have to do you just got to give yourself well I don't know about certain things I wouldn't worry we all have questions will left questions you and I yo will have some you know oh I wonder what brother beans Christians are I'll tell you later and then you may go away and say now I have more questions but that doesn't consume me because even even the Apostle John he's he's recording the gospel and then there's a and then so he's writing and they so it wasn't this way but it measures this way he's walking with this parchment and he's following Jesus writing things down he's watching and then and then they asked Jesus when is the kingdom you know when the kingdom is going to be restored when all these things going to happen and then Jesus says it's not for you to know so he's got to write down and stuff for me to know okay at that time he didn't know God reveals his word to you in its season you just walk with Him and as you walk with him he reveals himself amen is that right you don't have to be he didn't get consumed by this question and just forget about everything else he just walked amen and that's what we really need to do you know I'm just thinking the questions I have of that and I I've had them for a long time but sometimes the Lord says it's not for you to know right now okay thank you I just walk with you now what is it to think what about all the stuff going on and he says what is it to thee follow thou me what is it to you oh but but you're the dissolver of doubts and you answer all the questions and no what is it to you he said does the cycle Fotis it to you but I tell me you're the Messiah you know all things what does it do you follow thou me okay yes Lord I'll follow are you willing to do that but we have to have an understanding it's not your that's not how you act it's not your cond it's not your works and his blood they meant because if you're still relying on what you do then it's not a reality amen but I hope I'll hope you just don't take it the other extreme you say well I can't live a holy life well what are you trusting in he trusting in your own ability to live that life or you trusting in his blood to enable you to live that life I can't overcome this thing what are you trusting in I meant brother BAM says here sure we know there are things we do but how do we do it I mean it is us that gives up the smoking the drinking the whatever more but how do we give it up it's not by our own strength you say Lord I'm doing this in faith I meant his spirit enables you to overcome those things I feel like I'm walking a tightrope but but here I am I still I think I'm still on the wire amen but it's him you have to say Lord oh I'm done with this thing I want to give it up but you have to help me Lord to overcome it because that's he wants to give you the victory over the thing amen but we can't just sit back and say well I'm not free you know you walk and you walk as if you already have it I mean faith says it's mine I mean Abraham walked for 25 years we're going to have Isaac we're going to have Isaac pause when did that happen I can't remember I'm too old we're going to have Isaac we're going to have Isaac the promised son is coming the promised son is coming and maybe share events you would say Abraham you've gone mad you can't see now we're gonna have Isaac cause the promise was I'm having it hey you with me the promise brought it to reality it took 25 years to come across me whoa I'm we're gonna have the Sun we're gonna have the Sun and then eventually hallelujah God came down in flesh to send the thoughts of Sarah's hearts amen and then she began to judge God faithful that he could do it hallelujah and then finally she said we're going to have Isaac we're going to have Isaac hallelujah and they had Isaac and then Abraham said what was 25 years I walked in faith the whole time amen oh but I can't do it they couldn't do it she couldn't have the child he couldn't actually give the life to have the child they both dried up hallelujah but it says but he wasn't resting back saying well I can't do it Lord I tried nicely we're gonna have Isaac amen and eventually they had the child hallelujah now as I said a while ago move and we'll try and wrap this up soon our Lord so there are people people have gone on a conscious somewhere right people our Lord has not dead or asleep or just waiting to wake up sometime he says he says in first John to my little children these things I write unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate he is remember we're not alone in this walk I seen it before but I worry want to emphasize this because you would have confidence now is it finished as it finished because he paid and full on Calvary but then he's alive forevermore to ensure the victory that it that he won that day would be looked out in his people that means this is my little children these things I writer write unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is there propitiation for our sins and not ours only but also for the sins of the whole world hereby we know that we are hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments and he that saith I know him and keepeth not as Commandments as a liar and the truth is not in him but whosoever keepeth his word and him is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him and he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked but I want to take this we have an advocate we have an advocate he's not asleep someplace he's not a lifeless body someplace I mean but we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous hallelujah that there is a man job job wanted to know if there's only someone who could who could bridge the gap between a man like me and and Almighty God if only there was someone that could do it I'm not saying it verbatim but this is what he was questioning about you know in the book of Joe and then God became a man I mean to be that intercessor to be that mediator I mean between you and God that's why we don't pray to dead Saints I mean we don't pray to you know we don't pray to Mary or Joseph or whatever more amen we have one there's one mediator between God and man the Bible says as the man Christ Jesus hallelujah so now an advocate works on your behalf I mean he works on your bar he's not working against you he's not trying to pull a shady deal that he comes out the best amen but he is actually working on your behalf hallelujah so now we have a man in the heavens if I put it this way I mean who was God became flesh right and he is there working on your behalf amen that he is standing between you amen and judgment by as offering is this all okay now now an advocate isn't so this is in the Greek I won't try and pronounce that this is the English Way of saying it this is from the Strong's Concordance and it means an intercessor a consoler and advocate at comforter this is what the advocate means so I have someone working on you know working on my behalf hallelujah I don't need to worry about if he's working for me you're a thing about this if you're on death row you'd want the best lawyer you'd want the best one but even if you had the best one there's still be a question can he do it amen but as I said a while ago we have the best lawyer but our lawyer our judge became our lawyer or attorney and the case is settled right so if he is if he is our advocate if he is working for me it's all going to be fine isn't that right he'll work it up oh I don't know the details you know it's like an like in the law profession they could throw about a whole bunch of you're like you're like sister Kay's husband Peter he can throw out all this law jargon and I'll be more confused and probably more worried than when I came in but if I had confident and him that he's gonna he's gonna you know work out the case I don't need to understand the jargon right he will work on my behalf amen and he'll get what I need hallelujah he so we say well there's a lot of things I don't understand don't worry about it you could have confidence is he on is he working on your behalf hallelujah amen so he's out he's out advocate he's on our side now we're gonna finish soon he says but this man because he continueth forever both an unchangeable priesthood as Jesus being in each finger a priesthood that doesn't change wherefore he is also he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing that he ever liveth to make intercession for them Amen so he's making intercession for you for such a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who need a--the not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for the people's for this he did once when he offered up himself so he he became us there's what we just read he became us a man that he could understand what we go through in life hallelujah say what Jesus no one understands my situation in life Jesus does he was tempted on all points but yet without sin hallelujah so he knows the temptations you may face because he he experienced it but yet he didn't fall into that temptation he understands what it's like to be a to be immortal amen but he is out he is out he ever liveth to make his intercession for them now you may ask the question and this is not on here but you may ask the question but you say but when the lamb takes the book in revelations five let's see yo they say well Mercy's over people say Mercy's over but brother says when he leaves the throne it's all done but the Bible says that heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool I so these things he can do in his throne where he hasn't left it right because heaven is his throne see step 4 they took that book of redemption amen that doesn't mean Mercy's over you understand hallelujah because he's still the man his spirit is upon the earth but the man himself that we'll meet in the ear is still on his front he's still in heaven because heaven and earth as his throne hallelujah and so now he is still there we still have an advocate we still have a high priest we still have an intercessor I mean there's blood still on the mercy seat he is the mercy seat it's not a physical gold box that was just a shadow the reality has him amen so they're still he's still there but you got to understand when he took that book of symbolic brother Bram goes into Ruth and Boaz and he says when the lamb takes the book it's like Boaz claiming roof hallelujah he ties the two together and so now what he's saying remember it's a symbolic thing but it's also there's the second part of redemption I purchased I purchased her on Calvary now I'm gonna gather her up into heaven hallelujah because there's a purchasing near me then there's a claiming right so now he saw he's declaring now I've taken the book I've taken that book of redemption you're part of that book I mean you're part of that book now we believe he took the book do we know and he and he loose the seals and he brought it down to us at least you know showed us what the Bible is it's so symbolic remember but now if we believe that and now he's actually saying you are part of that book so it's you've been claimed right it's a claiming time because he says as the lamb takes the book it's like boys taking Ruth taking his wife and part of him part of Bowie's marrying Ruth as he had to redeem Naomi which was Ruth's mother-in-law he had to redeem the parcel of ground that that they lost and he had to redeem so he had to redeem the earth and he redeems domi which is the Israelite church Hebrew church but then he does all that to unite himself with the Gentile bride amen so now that's all though that's them being redeemed now now fullness of our Redemption as the change in the body right the adoption to what the change of the body now we believe he died for us on Calvary do we not do you believe that do you believe he's washed you of all your sins by that offering you've been cleansed you've been sanctified you've been glorified I mean you've already been called do you believe that I mean so now we have confidence yes it's nothing but the cross nothing but the blood but then if we believe it's nothing but him in the beginning then we have to have confidence it's nothing but him and the claiming hallelujah it's nothing nothing but him doing the claiming in the year because he purchased me so then he's gonna change my body take me in a rapture amen and then we should also have confidence now I'm just gonna yeah but we got a believer he he's paid at all I want you know the reality do you believe it's Christ as the reality and you say well that's in the first part I mean that's in the beginning of my salvation there'll be the end when he changes this body we go up into heaven but what about in the between time what about the between time now he sees this I'm just gonna skip through a few things cuz with now so brother brems telling a story we have to have confidence God uses us he can use us any moment of the day we are his body upon the earth and he works through his body now I'm talking about the believers around the world okay so now he's he's telling this story now cuz we're east I'll just read this my strength and my help cometh from the Lord thou art my artesian well thou art my youth they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint look god this is my duty to go I'm called to the post of duty and the first thing you know something begins to gurgle up on the inside of me he says the other day over in a little place I was having a meeting there in in Topeka Kansas there was a boy a young preacher one of my first sponsors brother Roy sitting here remembers the place in this great place there there was a minister had got under a roof or a place or a place to sidewall mesh them down beneath that that little fellow was going to die his liver was bursted his spleen was knocked out of place tongs fell on him I said at breakfast talking to my wife I said wife you know Jesus was here you know what he'd do I said when he sponsored me I believe that the word here sponsoring Christ I said that's the trick of the devil if Jesus was here he'd go lay his holy hands upon him the boy would get well I don't care if his liver is bursted he'd get well because Jesus would walk in there knowing exactly who he was now remember this is the between time this is the enemy's coming to try and take this young man's life this is the between time right between between receiving salvation and going in a body change this is the between time because we walked through this world and the devil tries to attack us robbed us of our joy and all different kinds of things and we think of only Jesus was here then everything would be fine he is here hallelujah now he says that's the trick of the devil if Jesus here he'd go lay his holy hands upon him the boy would get well I don't care if his liver as burst said he'd get well because Jesus would walk in there knowing exactly who he was do you know who you are in Christ do you know who you are in Christ doesn't matter if you're old or young or whatever do you know who what he has made you by one offering what do you what has he made you amen he noticed calling the scriptures was right vindicating him that he knowed who he was and not a shadow of doubt he had lay his hands upon him and say son be well walk out of there I'd say there isn't enough Devils in hell to kill that boy then I said he'd get well but I said you see honey he was Jesus the holy hands of God I said I'm a sinner I was born sexual birth my father and mother were both sinners and I'm just a no-good nothing this is the prophet speaking here I'm a no-good nothing and I said you know what if the Lord would give me a vision and send me down there then it would be different I said I'd go down there lay my hands on him he'd come out of that bed if he gave me a vision then I got to thinking after all if it was the vision what was it it was it was the same dirty hands on him same man praying for him same dirty hand so because his hands he sees a vision he goes to pray but he realize it's still by hands it's still me Amen then I begin to think I am his representative then God doesn't see me that blood of that righteous one lays up there upon the altar it makes intercessions for me he is my sufficiency here's my prayer here's my life and I said the only thing that would make me put my hands on him with faith because I have faith in the vision and without the vision the same faith would do the same thing amen that's why it's only belief don't worry anything else only believe the word he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover isn't that right and that's anyone can do it these signs shall follow them that believe who believes right that's a promise of his word so it doesn't matter about conditions and and how bad the case may be these signs shall follow them that believe it means the same faith would do the same thing right because many times we're looking for something big no same faith with or without the vision would do the same thing and without the vision the same faith would do the same thing so I can Rickon myself nothing but I reckon him my all and all he is my life he is my commissioner no denomination send me he sent me hallelujah I go on his name now I'll lay my hands upon him walk down there laid my hands on that boy and that night he was in the meeting solid well Amen oh yes he's that fountain no other fount I know nothing but the blood of Jesus I'm a stinker I'm a renegade every one of us are but I believe but but I believe before God we are perfect be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect how can you be because a perfect one represents us there that fountain is there everyday fresh not some stagnated something but fresh every day that washes away all my sins he is that fountain hallelujah now if he can have confidence in that I'm how about us that's the same stinking hands hallelujah but we have a perfect one who's our representative hallelujah and he's been accepted therefore we're accepted hallelujah amen so now this is the in-between time now this problem this this this young boy who are sponsoring
