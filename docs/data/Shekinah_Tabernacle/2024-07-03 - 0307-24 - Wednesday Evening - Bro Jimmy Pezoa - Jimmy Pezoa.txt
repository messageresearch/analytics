together Lord to praise your name hallelujah thank you for takeing care of us Lord thank you for this meeting I want to ask you Lord to please talk through me to bless your church Lord I ask you this in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can have your seats [Music] amen so the first scripture that I want to to read to you today is in First Peter um chapter 5 thank you m so the Bible says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walkth about seeking who he made devor seeking he's not sitting down he's seeking whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world we are not alone in this yeah but the but the God of all Grace who had called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen amen amen so today I want to talk about this subject beware of lions Beware of the lion and if you want under your own risk live Jesus under your own own risk yeah cuz the devil is trying to destroy you amen so here um I asked on Google about lions and how they hunt so it says here lion stock their prey the lion the devil he has been watching you he knows exactly what you're thinking he's a cleav um oh you could call this it's a CLI Spirit he has been in this world for 6,000 years he know man he know exactly what you thinking he knows you he knows you very well he knows your soft spot he knows how to get you absolutely well we have a greater God With Us amen huj so when close enough attempt a short short charge of the prey trying either to pounce on the Target or knock it off how does a lion kills its prey lion kills a prey by breaking its neck or suffocating it by clamping their jaws around its throat so cuz I watched some videos of how lions kill the prey they jump on the leaks of the animal if the animal is Big it's going to jump on the leaks and that animal is not going to be able to come to church anymore that person it's not going to be able able to come to church cuz it grabbed them by the feet and when the animal is down goes for the Thro and that person cannot worship anymore that person is in a horrible stage if you are hunted if you have been prayed of the devil cuz I have in the past you are done in that moment you cannot you don't want to seek from the Lord I don't know why because there's so much sin that the devil make you do what you willingly do knowing the truth that you know that you have done wrong and you don't want to fix it and you just you can't come to church you don't want to come to church and you cannot praise the Lord amen also here the Bible says lions are Fierce predators that often again stalk their pray before attacking their attacks cause to the prey to panic and dispers allowing the Lions to isolate yeah yeah this guy he really wanted you to isolate for from everyone absolutely cuz when you are alone you are easy target yeah and attack a weaker or slower individual by hunting together lions are able to exhaust and kill the prey we have seen it yeah some people there are not fellows in the mark much Tred to stay alone what would happen next amen I put this picture here because I'm not too sure if it's for brother Brandon but I hear from a wonderful message that the devil is also like a boxer and if he he hits you hard and you start bleeding in one spot guess where is going to be the next hit in the same spot cuz he want to to bring you down and those um soft spots in your life are the ones that you really have to watch cuz that's the gate that you open and once it's open he's always going to try to come in the same way oh my it can be we not many of you guys have done drugs but for me that I did drugs the devil try to try to came on the same way but I received Jesus in my life so I remember cuz um I was working at the farm and what farmers do they just drink a little of alcohol when the day is done and they always used to offer me free free drinks free beers and I was like no sorry I don't drink and they were like really I yep that gate is shut now yeah where all the gates shut I hope that all those gates are shut cu the devil is going to try to get so because of the kids they have been asking me about this I have a question for you today and how many sheep were in Noah's Ark a two b 14 C 8 and D 20 and the end going to be soon so when you are destructed is when the devil can get you but it's so easy to get destructed in this world if you're at school you're trying to fit in one group if you're working you are thinking work because otherwise you can cut your fingers it's so easy just to get distracted amen and that's what the devil wants you that's why this world is just so to get distracted I was reading something it said like there's always something happening in 5 seconds that's how much you can kind of concentrate because there's something that's going to happen in the next 5 Seconds that's going to throw your attention and you're not going to be able to be just focused on something but if you are distracted doing something beware because there is a lion that is hunting you can you see that guy how was trying to hide but that guy is too big to hide you can know if you pay attention how the Bible says like sorry say be sober and be vigilant if you are Vigilant you're going to know when that guy is chasing you because you have soft spot and you know that that guy is trying to get you in some ways amen here I have one uh quote of brother BR says this is my favorite quote is on my fridge say remember we are not on a picnic but we are in a battlefield many people just think that when they become a Christian that's that's all they need to do that sett forever as they are Christian and everything goes going to come easy don't never get that in your head yeah don't never get that in your head for I become a Christian to fight fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get in the battle lines yeah it's not going to be easy but it's going to be wonderful hallelujah amen you know every single day that I have to leave my house I'm so grateful for the Lord amen that I have a family I have a roof over my head I have firewood if you have been doing firewood lately I have everything amen amen but when some people they are being pre of the devil they don't want to know anything yeah about um Christian people they are being Hur they have been isolated for the devil for way too long and that's how they said we have seen it but us as a church and I'm going to to the the thought of this we should be praying for this people amen hallelujah amen amen Matthew 26 chap uh verse 41 said watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak the spirit is always willing to pray always willing to listen a tape always willing to testify but our flesh just wants something different amen I'm I'm being at work and sometimes I like I should be listening at a tape but I prefer to listen some songs I should be leing a tape our flesh is just weak but our spirit is always pushing always pushing and that small voice is just men oh my Lord and that's why I really like when being ask me to if I can speak on Wednesdays cuz that Stephanie knows that pushed me to pray and to seek from the Lord amen I just thank you man here we have a her of buffalos yeah now there's two lions eating a buffalo right and all those all what those guys are doing they are just staring and watching yeah I hope that that's not us cuz those guys there's someone son someone's daughter that's being attacked by the devil and what those guys are doing they're just stearing but this's a saying Unity makes strength now this is when a head realize that they are stronger this is when a head realize that they can do something about it yeah right and that's not the only picture that I got I got that one too that's how they can chase down the devil away this is prayer and look what one Buffalo can do to a lion amen amen yes sir so why they only sometimes they just stare don't know I hope that's not us and the answer of this question who says two two Lambs 14 Lambs eight 20 Lambs well the answer is in Genesis 7 says and the Lord said unto Noah Come Thou and out thy house into the ark for the have seen righteousness before me in this generation of every clean Beast Thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his feemale female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female now sheeps are clean or unclean animals so they were 14 in the a now all this deal with the devil being a lion he's not a real lion amen he's just a fake the Bible says like a lion the same way that he wants to be worshiped as God yeah he is just an i WN to be yeah he doesn't have any power amen amen uh Colossians 2 says bloting out the H reading and I went to Google too because I didn't know the meaning of this and bloting Out means to cause something to disappear or to remove something unpleasant from your your thoughts yeah have you ever had those kind of thoughts that you have to close your eyes very hard cuz you want them just to go away plotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it in that moment the Lord was just triumphing when he was at the cross that was settles everything down the devil didn't have any power over us we have a real lion amen yes Revelations 5 says and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David ha prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and L in the midst of the throne and of the four beast in the mid of the elders it stood a lamb and as it had been slain he is our lion yeah he doesn't want you he doesn't want to destroy you amen he wants to protect you yeah Hallelujah he's a real lion amen now in Chile in 2008 or five I can't remember I wrote it down there was a tragedy because um there were some soldiers that there was at the mountain they were very young they were only 18 years old and one General he asked him to go down the mountain without the propagar now there was a storm that um caught them and there was U the temperature ofus 35° 45 of them died only 22 of them survived um but the Army after that that thing happened they start to find them with those long bit Bars of Steel cuz they were like under two meters of snow wow when um some of the um reporters they start asking why they were not going to give up to try to find the mo one General said because they belongeth to the Army the Chilean army they we need them all yeah we need to give them back to their families now after a while they got all of them and they just took the dead bodies to the families how much us that we Are Soldiers of Christ amen we have something to pray today I think yes sir and they were just able to take some dead bodies but we trust in God that he can give life Amen to some dry bones amen I was once a dry bones a very dry bones but the Lord put life on me yes sir and I'm pretty sure there some of you too you were just dry bones amen yes sir There's Hope amen we have a greater God With Us amen now let's just have the musicians amen let's just play um there is power in the name of Jesus amen amen so I really think that today
