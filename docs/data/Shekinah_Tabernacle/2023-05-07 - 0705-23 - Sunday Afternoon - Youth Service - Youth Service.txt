with a Melody you surround me with us all Deliverance [Music] from my enemy [Music] through all my fear s [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] if you could um just turn to your Bibles to Leviticus chapter 25 and 10. and I'm going to talk about the pardon today I mean so in Leviticus 25 and 10 it says here and ye shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his position and ye shall return every man unto his family I mean so we all know that to announce the the Jubilee there was a trumpet sounded amen so when that iul have your seats when that trumpet sounded all the slaves they all got to go free so and and you know they could go back to their their family and their inheritance and the main reason that everyone got to go free was because was just they needed a place of Refuge and um otherwise I'd be in this property so this was you know as we all know just the Israelites who were basically as all voluntarily they were in slavery amen so you know I could imagine you know there may have been a man with his his wife and children you know and um and perhaps the place that they were living in was going through a time of of drought amen and you know and in times of drought a lot of people used to probably back in that day they run out of money and you know if this guy had things on tick on finance you know perhaps his farm he had a bit of a mortgage and fall as his old plows and stuff maybe as oxen he would have eventually run out of money and then you know he could probably no longer support his family his wife and his children so then this man would basically be forced to voluntarily sign himself over to to slavery I don't quite know who it was for I think it may have been for the people he owed money to but anyways um so you know perhaps it was the 40th year saying you that you know he he would be in slavery for 10 years so you know he probably he would have signed himself over and then he would have he would have worked quite hard to you know and there would have probably been a percentage of that money would have gone to his family and stuff and he would probably have to go to the next you know move to another to another place and go live there and work there so some of those people might not have seen their families you know for 10 years but you know that man would have been looking forward to that 50th year I'm sure he would have been he would have been really looking forward to it and then when that trumpet finally sounded that man walk free I mean his debt paid off and he could return to his family and you know we we came from and stuff and that that Jubilee it's at that was a pardon yeah because you know a pardon means this is the noun the action of forgiving or being forgiven for an error or offense so that man may have had still heaps of money owing no he probably they him you know he wouldn't have worked at all off but as soon as that trumpet sounded all the debt was cleared and he could walk straight through I mean he was he was completely completely set free I mean he didn't it was a free pardon he didn't have to pay for anything he didn't have to pay for that trumpet to blow it was all free it just came free to him but there were some slaves that they didn't you know they didn't they basically said I would I just want to say a slave I like it here you know that this is where I find my identity working for someone anyway so you know they they didn't accept it and they got their ears pulled through and they were became forever slaves they they could never leave even if they wanted to that was them and this was a true story and night uh 1830 um this was over in the states there were two men one was um a mailman called George Wilson the other James Porter robbed a mail carrier so do you guys know what a mail carrier is you have you if for any of you don't you may have read like a cowboy an Indian book when you were younger and there were like those stage coaches they're all the Apaches and all the Indians and all you know Jesse James and Lynnwood Rob anyways yeah so they robbed one of those but these these Two Fellas got caught and they were both scheduled to be hanged so they're going to be executed and James Porter got executed on schedule so Andy unfortunately he went first and then but George had some very influential friends and and the Parliament where um the president was and they managed to get to Andrew Jackson who was the president at that time and they basically got Andrew Jackson to write up this man George Wilson a a pardon that he would only spend 20 years in in prison so but it seems like a long time but it's better than being you know hanged getting executed that way so anyway so but funnily enough George Wilson didn't accept the pardon so the case went before The Supreme Court and they there was a man that um who was the head of the Supreme Court John he basically wrote that a pardon cannot be forced upon someone a part it must be accepted if not it has no power I mean so this this man didn't accept his pardon and therefore you know he he got executed so yes they must and needs to be accepted you can't just get a pardon and force it upon someone who doesn't work that way a pardon is accepted yeah it must be but the Lord has the pardon as well I mean so not not we were just talked about a natural pardon that a president wrote but the Lord Jesus Christ has has a pardon for us and I have a quote here from Brother Branham says we're all Sinners but the only way we can be saved is by accepting the Lord Jesus and his free pardon amen and have another quote Christ took every place and freed us from every Affliction and every sin that the devil put us in the prison house why Christ come to Pardon us freely I mean now I can look I look here at an ex in chapter 26 Paul Paul went to see King Agrippa and anyways he he was brought before him and then Paul told king of gruffa you know everything he'd been through how he met the Lord how he planned to go places and tell more people about the Lord you know continue on his missionary work and anyways while he was saying this there's someone interrupted and based um called Paul MADD IE but then Paul Paul's like to Ken Griffey he's like hey man I know that you believe everything that I've this isn't what he's it isn't exactly what he said but this is trying to put it in in terms um I I you know I know that you believe everything I've said is true except he basically told him accept the Lord Jesus as your savior and in Acts 26 28 then Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou persuade us me to be a Christian amen so this man he he had his part and it was right there but he didn't accept it and you know the for for whatever reason it may have been his friends you know who thought he would have been the same as Paul he would also be mad but because because you know because of that peer pressure he sort of he folded didn't accept it and anyways King agrappa basically went and got ball and um threw him prison under a centurion that was in his band but to those that do accept the pardon they get blessed amen you you will come to find out that you never had a start and you never have an End Amen and you shall live eternally with the God who granted you and that sounds kind of cool and you know all the all the effects of sin and all that you know they they have no more hold on you and then you know the devil can't drag you back down you know down to Hell I mean but you know I'd like to ask you have you know have have you received the Lord's pardon and its fullness you know because you know if you receive the party you don't just succeed accept a little piece I just accept eternal life for you know I just accept this little but you know you have to accept all of the word amen amen so I trust you all truly blessed I'd just like to leave it there and thank you [Applause] I mean it's just sing a course full moderate brother Mario comes up it's um seeing Amazing Grace [Music] it's so sweet [Music] was blind but now I see Amazing Grace [Music] fly me [Music] was loved but now I found was gone my chains are gone I've been set free my God my savior has Ransom of me remember [Music] that's all [Music] our friends [Music] [Music] the god I've been set free my God my second please [Music] Amazing Grace feet the father Lord be thankful your amazing graceful and our lives Lord Jesus it makes all the difference Lord I really appreciate what you did for us Lord we we thank you for that pardon Lord we accept it Lord Jesus Lord it means so much to us Lord It's just life to us Lord and it's overcoming to us Lord Lord we thank you for it Lord and I just I just pray Lord that you'll be with with me as I just bring this message out Lord Jesus and just calm my nerves and be with me I pray Lord and may just be a blessing Lord and Lord will be at your hands and feet Lord Jesus Lord you use the foolishness of preaching Lord to speak to your people or we just thank you commit us into your hands in Jesus name amen thank you musicians [Music] uh let's just turn our Bibles to a Genesis 1 verse 1. the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was it was it was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and then let's just turn to John 3 verse 3 as well the Bible says Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee accept the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus saith unto him actually now we'll stop right there and then I'm just Ephesians 2 um verse 4. the Bible says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved you can have your seats ah this is just going to be a very simple Sunday school lesson if you like so I trust it's a blessing um we can see here in Genesis 1 verse 1 where the Bible talks about what says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and brother Brian says um he created the heavens and the Earth full stop and what happened between then and the next verse and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep we don't know um but the way brother Brandon describes how the earth was formed he he described describes it as God first created the Sun and then from the sun he created the Stars he describes it like a cinder or a clinker flinging off from the Sun and that was the first star and in the next one and then he led an earth-sized clinker fly from the Sun and the clinker fell and he said stop and um the the clinker stopped and that was the Earth but at that point it was just a ball of ice this is how brother Reynold describes it it was nothing there was no form to it was just a ball of ice and um and then God brought that ball of ice back closer to the Sun and started making it spin revolve and the water's melted and brother am says theirs where you find where the Bible says the Earth was without form and void and I just want to read a quote to you in the full seal by the band says I was talking to a person not long ago trying to discuss with me and saying aren't you ashamed to say that the that God created the heavens and the Earth in three days in six days I said that's what the Bible said said well we got evidence and can prove that the world is millions of years old I said that didn't have anything to do with it in Genesis 1 verse 1 that said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period That's all seen now the world was without form and void and I said I believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off and the light Struck it up come the trees and everything um but then can you take it back to that first slide yeah that's just how I just how brother Brown describes that ball of ice so brother Branham here talks about a previous civilization um on the Earth and that likely was when all the dinosaurs and things were here and and there may have even been people we don't know but for whatever reason that came to an end and then the Earth came to a state where it was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and that's like our lives um our Earth we we we had a past life we were dead in sins and trespasses and you don't necessarily need to have been out there drinking and partying to have um to to have your for your Earth to be without form and void like you can just not be born again yet and not having given your life to God yet and your Earth is without form and void and you might be you might be not that didn't well dead and sins and trespasses but then unbelief just doing your own thing not serving God but like brother Brown says that seed those seeds that God brought forth was already in the earth and so that seed of God's already in you and that seed has to come out if it's in you it has to come out amen just like the earth the earth didn't basically have a choice um the Lord brought it forth he spoke over the Earth and that seed was brought forth so whether you run a long time or were you give an easy coming you're going to come basically and you know it's like we've heard over the pulpit a lot it takes the right atmosphere you need to be in the right atmosphere to to for that seed to grow um and brother Brown is here and um a ceremony says then God said to the Holy Ghost we'll just take it in simple form now you go forth and you go to making love to that world because I'm love and you're a product of me so now you go and make love to the world uh and the big Holy Ghost we think coming out there just in picture form now it wasn't that way of course the Holy Ghost and God is the self-same person pardon me and just say he throwed his wings around the earth and he began to brooding what's that brooding like the hint of a chicken's cooing and making love Gluck cluck cluck oh life come forth he screamed he looked around I want Beauty on this Earth come forth light the Holy Ghost are moving and when he did by look coming there's a creaking down the hill Yonder somewhere Yonder some calcium pouring down and mixtures with potash what's it folding into life come forth and a little Easter flower stuck his head up from a rock from under a rock come here father look at that that looks good just keep on brooding he brewed out the flowers he brought out the vegetation he brought out the animal life the birds flew out of the dust and after a while up come a man and a woman upcoming man and the man was both man and woman and the creation goes on and it's you know our lives is like that wherever we found ourselves um God knew exactly where you were who you are and he's brooding over you like might not even feel it but he's there and he's brooding over you and he's loving you and eventually that sea will come come come forth and God will turn your Void Earth into a beautiful Earth with plants and creatures brother Branham says that's how we got Jesus is because it's because that God loved the world something was produced because of his love and Jesus the Savior was produced that grand old story and and you know the creation didn't happen overnight it was a process God created was created over time and you might not see everything in your life straight away it's a work in progress but but it's happening and it can't stop from happening um as I said earlier you know the Earth couldn't stop itself from being changed it couldn't change itself God had to change it and as a son and daughter of God I'm so thankful that we can't stop his work in our lives like we might have our ups and downs um it doesn't matter it doesn't it doesn't actually matter and you know God spoke to that Earth and he said let there be and what each one of us needs is God to speak in our lives and say Let There Be and and it'll bring forth and you know if he speaks to the Earth it has to bring forth it might take time but it has to come forth the Bible says he hath made all things beautiful in his time can we just turn to Romans chapter 8 verse 28 as a bit of a lengthy reading there the Bible says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the call according to his purpose I mean there's a there's a purpose in our lives there's um it's more than just existing and maybe having a family and dying it's more than that it's um you know Our Lives compared to Eternity is actually such a small little window like it's nothing it's just a burn prick really who for whom he did for now he also to predestinate to be conformed to the image of a son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he'd predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom we Justified the India also glorified what shall we say then do these things if God before us who can be against us how can our Earth stay void and and just water he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with them also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us the Bible says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword and it goes on down to say nay and all these things we are more than conquerors to him that loved us and verse 39 says nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus you know that love you know the Lord brooding over your life it's um can we there's a quote that might be the next one can we just put that on yeah is that one um brother Ramsay is here and he's doing it today he has made a preparation to conserve his own purpose no sorry that's not I was read it up there oh my that's trying to exhaust God's goodness and mercy to his people he wants to bless you he's ready he's pressing could you imagine taking all the waters in the Earth the seeds and everything and piling it into one four foot pipe and put it up there the pressure that would be on the bottom of it trying to find a little crevice to leak its way through that's like the pressure of the Holy Spirit trying to come down on every life amen I mean and we just it's like um by the Andy preached on Wednesday you know we it's what are you willing to surrender what are you willing to give up and um and you know there might be certain things in our lives that's holding that back I believe in the end that will win through but but it's if we if we just give ourselves to him I'm sure that will you know that will have effect a lot quicker amen foreign God did not make you and I just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose therefore there is a purpose of all of us being here you're not here just to be another human being you were here because God made you for some purpose you're not here just to eat the food that God growed you're not here just to live in the house that man made or to wear the clothing that someone fashioned you're here for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are or how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose my nail on my fingers for a purpose my eye and every part of our bodies is to serve a purpose and it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it was God's divine plan to do so and you know sometimes it's hard knowing what is God's purpose um we're not all called to make a move in it's all very clear but I believe if we're sincere we ask the Lord he'll show it yes and if we're here for a purpose then there is nothing that can destroy us and God until God's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that God has put us here for has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches or Sorrows that we go through all of those are reasons and there's a reason for it we will take for instance Noah in the Bible yeah I'll I'll skip that yeah yeah amen and you know one thing that I always think about is defeat is not an option giving up is not an option as a Christian you don't you don't actually have that option um if if you gave up because things are hard and difficult uh you'll probably end up in a worse spot than the hard and difficult you're experiencing but um I'm so thankful like we cannot lose um you know as Sons and Daughters of God we we cannot lose and yeah it's like David said you know the pardon it's you know all everything that we need is contained in the pardon and it's not just a pardon for sins it's not just a pardon for it doesn't just give you eternal life it's also a button that gives you Victory it gives you Joy and and and I believe we can access all those and um yeah may the Lord help us and you know you know back to that Earth that analogy of the earth that's without form and void like you might be bound by complexes and even unbelief like just a bit of a testimony in my own life like there was a point where I was basically wallowing an unbelief and I didn't know how to get myself out of it and um and the Lord just worked things in such a way that it completely changed the whole thing and and you know of course the devil will always try and still attack with unbelief it's his job but um but yeah I mean the Lord the Lord can change that so you might you might not even you know some people might not even want to serve him praise the Lord for the young fellows that got baptized today that's awesome that's um as you're turning from being void into that and um so thankful for that and you know but if you find yourself in a place like that where you maybe don't want to serve them or you don't know if if this is all true ask the Lord ask him Lord if this is true show me amen and I and I know he will and um and you know we can't change our hearts but we can ask God lord change my heart if there's something in there that shouldn't be that way if I think a certain way of act a certain way Lord you can change me and um and you know one thing I also struggled with quite a lot and some I'm still battler today is just spending time in the wood and praying you know um and I always used to pray Lord um give me a desire for your word and you know with that desire it's so much easier to do it and and then yeah and one thing I um I I thought about a lot was um you know what you do today has effects tomorrow yes so if you spend time with a word today and you pray down the track it'll benefit you the same way if you feed on not necessary stuff that's wrong but just constantly out of the atmosphere of God um down the track is that that those results in your life but if you if you spend that time you say Lord give me a desire I will produce fruits down down the track in your life yeah so um that's basically it's basically what I have here and um yeah Lord Jesus may may he just in his own way continue to change us from that that first picture which was can you put up that picture of the icy ball and then the next one with the waters you know may the that's probably something what it looked like I don't know but that's maybe a good picture of what it looked like there's nothing there's no life there and um the spirit of God moved upon those Waters and he's moving upon your and my life and um yeah if you haven't given your heart to the Lord yet maybe he's calling you to give um your heart to the Lord and if you have you know we constantly grow like there's maybe sort of still some portions of your creation that's got to come forth and Lord may I come forth we are willing we'll be you know we we surrender um we give ourselves Lord um can we just uh Ed you put a one of the verses that you put up before the service it's not the one with the picture of the Earth but the other one yeah I hope our help is in the name of the Lord who made Heaven and Earth and I think it was this morning um it was a verse that said you know the Earth is the Lord's so our Earth is the Lord's it's not it's not really your Earth you know um that's right it is the Lord's and if it's his it's you know he's going to work on you and you're gonna you're gonna move from avoid condition to an earth so yeah very simple very basic um Justin that was a blessing amen can we go thank you Josh hey man let's stand sing the original
