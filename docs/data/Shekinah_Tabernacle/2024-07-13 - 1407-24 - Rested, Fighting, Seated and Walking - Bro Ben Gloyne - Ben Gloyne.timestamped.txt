[38:54] his and in his law doth he meditate day
[38:57] and night he shall be like a tree
[38:59] planted by the rivers of water that
[39:01] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[39:03] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[39:06] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper they

[41:19] Christ's name amen amen amen God bless
[41:22] you friends you can have your seats uh
[41:24] um this morning so I want to speak about
[41:26] resting fire seated and walking now this
[41:29] is this may said seem like contradictory
[41:32] of terms but the believer is doing all
[41:34] these things now we are seated we are so
[41:37] I want to start with the resting aspect
[41:39] of this amen because you know the
[41:41] Christian walk is all based on the
[41:43] principle of rest yeah we are we are
[41:46] resting in his ability now I just want
[41:49] to read a couple of quotes here brother
[41:51] BR he um he said now now there's now the
[41:54] whole he says now what I found around
[41:57] most Christian lives most I hate to say
[41:59] it this way but it's true that most
[42:01] people that profess Christianity they
[42:03] seem to be have such a hard struggling
[42:06] time to hold on I believe it's a lack of
[42:09] correct teaching of the Bible I mean
[42:11] there's no such a thing as holding on he
[42:13] done the holding on Amen the whole
[42:15] Christian principle is based upon rest
[42:18] amen so it's not your striving not your
[42:20] pushing your pulling not your ability
[42:22] it's his ability amen so when we sit
[42:25] because remember we are resting in his
[42:26] ability
[42:27] and that is not just a idea of well he
[42:30] can fulfill his word but we rest in the
[42:32] fact he's in US fulfilling his word amen
[42:35] so we we see he says come unto me all ye
[42:38] that labor and a heavy laden and I will
[42:40] give you rest don't have to worry and
[42:42] struggle you're just resting that's all
[42:44] given rest you enter in peace the whole
[42:47] and that the whole thing's finished them
[42:49] who has called is Justified those he has
[42:52] Justified he has already glorified amen
[42:54] he says quoting scripture so as the Lord
[42:56] said that come unto me and I will give
[42:59] you rest now I just want to read a
[43:00] couple of these because to me it's so
[43:02] powerful and I pray that this becomes
[43:04] just the just the experience of our
[43:06] whole Christian Journey as that the
[43:08] Christian experience is based solemnly
[43:10] and wholly upon rest so not partially
[43:13] upon rest not a little bit of rest but
[43:16] complete rest come unto me all ye that
[43:18] labor in a heavy laden I'll give you
[43:20] rest we're tossed about with everything
[43:22] until you come to Christ then it's all
[43:25] finished am mean resting in Christ
[43:27] perfectly no matter what comes or goes
[43:29] nothing can touch us without it comes
[43:31] over the shepherd He has to permit it
[43:34] the Bible says all things work together
[43:36] for good to them that love the Lord and
[43:38] I say if you're in rest that is a real
[43:40] to you it's not just an idea you're
[43:42] trying to connect your life with it's a
[43:44] reality amen because you're resting that
[43:47] he has allowed all things amen and
[43:50] there's nothing that the devil can pull
[43:51] over our god he has to go before our God
[43:54] and ask permission before he can do
[43:56] anything whether the devil likes it or
[43:58] not he is not the boss our God is the
[44:00] boss the Lord Jesus Christ is supreme he
[44:03] is the boss and he has to go ask
[44:05] permission and whatever God allows he
[44:07] cannot overstep that boundary he cannot
[44:10] go beyond it he can't stretch it he can
[44:11] go as far as the Lord allows amen you
[44:15] know when job entered his great
[44:16] Temptation you know that where God would
[44:18] God would actually testify to the devil
[44:20] about job and say he's a perfect man
[44:22] there's none like him in all the Earth
[44:23] and you know so the devil would make a
[44:25] challenge while it's the only reason
[44:27] that he loves you the way he does is
[44:29] because nothing goes wrong in his life
[44:31] look he's blessed he's got family he's
[44:32] got riches he's got all these things and
[44:34] but then God God knew what was in job
[44:37] before job knew what was in job amen and
[44:39] Jo and God knew more about job than the
[44:41] devil did amen because God knew that
[44:44] job's experience of his Christian walk
[44:46] was not based on the blessings and the
[44:49] things the temporal things that come and
[44:51] go it was solemnly bled upon rest what
[44:54] was he resting in the shed blood of the
[44:56] Lamb that's he was resting in amen so
[44:59] when the enemy came against him God
[45:01] first gave gave gave instructions or
[45:03] gave license say look you can touch
[45:05] everything he has but not him and the
[45:08] devil did that he went to the nth degree
[45:09] took everything right and then the next
[45:12] time the Devil comes up before God you
[45:13] know God says basically I Told You
[45:16] So I Told You So devil right basically
[45:19] what he said and then he said well the
[45:21] only reason he still loves you is
[45:22] because he's got his health so once
[45:25] again God gave him God gave him
[45:27] permission you can do whatever you want
[45:28] you just can't take his life and what
[45:29] the devil took him to the nth degree but
[45:31] so our God is in control of all things
[45:34] amen we're got to just rest in this fact
[45:36] amen that God allows all things and
[45:39] those things are going to work together
[45:40] for your good amen if you love the Lord
[45:43] and are called according to his purpose
[45:45] it's going to work for your good you may
[45:46] not understand it in the circumstance
[45:49] but it's going to work for your good
[45:50] otherwise Romans 8:28 is a lie it's true
[45:54] hallelujah amen so if you're resting in
[45:56] that fact amen or if it's been revealed
[45:58] to you you can rest in that amen let me
[46:01] tell you that when God permits anything
[46:02] it'll be working for your good so when
[46:04] sickness be the so would sickness be the
[46:06] same thing certainly that God might heal
[46:09] you and show you a great testimony give
[46:10] you a little something to move on for
[46:12] all things work together for good amen
[46:15] let's just do one more because I like
[46:17] this but a True Believer his faith it
[46:19] rests solidly un shifting as he
[46:21] approaches the word of God why CU he's
[46:23] resting in the ability of his God I see
[46:26] the Christian fa faith is based solidly
[46:28] upon rest that's right a Christian is
[46:30] not tossed about a Christian doesn't run
[46:32] from place to place wondering if this is
[46:34] right or this is right or is this true
[46:35] is this opinion right no they don't
[46:37] shift those kind of things they are Bas
[46:39] solemly upon the word of God a Christian
[46:41] doesn't fuss and fume and worry about
[46:43] things a Christian rests it's all over
[46:46] it's all finished for the believer at
[46:47] Calvary that's right oh sickness may
[46:49] come and disappointments but the
[46:51] Christian is at rest knowing this that
[46:54] God is able to keep that which he has
[46:56] performed amen knowing that no matter
[46:58] what the thing is and how it looks that
[47:00] there is neither sickness sorrow death
[47:02] nor neither starvation or anything that
[47:04] can separate us from the love of God
[47:06] that's in Jesus Christ we're at rest
[47:08] Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she
[47:10] wants to The Anchor
[47:12] Holds hallelujah amen so so the
[47:15] Christian journey is based completely
[47:17] upon rest amen the Christian experience
[47:19] is based completely upon rest it's not
[47:21] based upon our ability or anything that
[47:23] we could we could achieve it's no
[47:26] resting when you enter into his rest
[47:28] amen because we know that the that the
[47:30] true Sabbath is receiving the Holy Ghost
[47:33] it's not keeping a day it's not it's not
[47:35] your own works that would allow you to
[47:38] enter into this rest but this rest as
[47:40] the Lord Jesus Is Us quoting there from
[47:42] those quotes he says come unto me all ye
[47:44] that are heavy laden and I will give you
[47:46] rest amen I'll give you rest for your
[47:49] souls amen and and and we know the
[47:51] Apostle Paul he picks these things up
[47:53] when he when he's writing the book of
[47:54] Hebrews in the book of Hebrews he's cont
[47:57] contrasting um the you you the Old
[47:59] Testament the blood of bulls and goats
[48:01] amen with the blood of Jesus Christ he's
[48:03] contrasting the aonic priesthood with
[48:05] the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:07] he's contrasting everything and he says
[48:09] that the that the one we now have is far
[48:11] Supreme than the old the old is just a
[48:13] shadow it's just a just a form but the
[48:16] new is the reality amen so when we are
[48:18] resting we're resting in reality amen
[48:21] remember this rest we're talking about
[48:22] is not an absence of trouble it's not an
[48:25] absence of Trials it's not an absence of
[48:27] hardship no that that is not the rest
[48:29] we're talking about this rest is not
[48:31] some yoga retreat somewhere with some
[48:33] with some scentered candles and you know
[48:35] nothing no problems no that's not the
[48:37] rest no the rest is there you can be in
[48:39] the greatest storm that's ever existed
[48:42] but there's such a solid unmovable Rock
[48:44] in your soul that God is able am mean
[48:46] God is willing God is present and I'm
[48:48] his child and he cares for me and I'm at
[48:51] rest I'm not worried what about the
[48:53] future he holds the future he held the
[48:55] past he holds the present and he's going
[48:57] to hold the future amen so we can rest
[48:59] in his ability don't be worried about
[49:01] nothing does that mean you get all laxad
[49:03] dael and nonchalant and no you don't if
[49:06] you're at rest you're fighting at if
[49:09] you're at rest you're pursuing if you're
[49:10] at rest you're walking with God I mean
[49:13] you're not sitting under a coconut tree
[49:14] watching the world go by no you're
[49:16] pushing the battle I mean cuz you have
[49:18] such a rest in your soul I can't lose
[49:21] amen cuz God can't God couldn't lose
[49:23] amen he came all the way down through
[49:25] the Old Testament the devil couldn't
[49:26] stop stop him amen he stood in a body of
[49:28] Flesh the devil couldn't stop him I mean
[49:30] he went to Calvary the devil couldn't
[49:31] stop him he went to hell the devil
[49:33] couldn't stop him he arose from the
[49:34] grave cuz the devil couldn't stop him he
[49:36] pulled his Spirit out upon the day of
[49:37] Pentecost cuz the devil couldn't stop
[49:39] him amen and the spirit of God has gone
[49:41] through seven Church ages and devil
[49:42] couldn't stop him and the devil can't
[49:44] stop him in this day am mean so if
[49:46] you're at rest you know if if the devil
[49:48] couldn't stop my God then he can't stop
[49:50] me now am mean cuz my God is in me my
[49:53] God is
[49:54] able hallelujah amen so so so what are
[49:57] you doing then then you're pushing the
[49:58] battle you're not hiding in some bunker
[50:00] saying W is me you say no where's that
[50:03] enemy amen where's that thing that's
[50:05] hindering me amen because if nothing
[50:07] could stop him and he's in you nothing
[50:09] can stop you so then why let things stop
[50:12] you oh my Lord Jesus hallelujah amen
[50:14] that's why if we're at rest we're
[50:16] fighting amen we're not just sitting
[50:17] around just pretending nothing's going
[50:19] on no we're at rest cuz we have Supreme
[50:21] confidence in the Supreme one that
[50:24] dwells in you and I Hallelujah Hall amen
[50:27] so the Apostle Paul would say here in
[50:30] Hebrews he said let us therefore fear
[50:32] lest our promise being left of us
[50:34] entering into his rest any of you should
[50:36] seem to come short of it for unto us was
[50:38] the Gospel preached as well as unto them
[50:40] he know he's speaking about Israel
[50:42] coming out of Egypt as you if you read
[50:44] the previous chapter uh for the word
[50:46] preached did not profit them not being
[50:48] mixed with faith and them that heard it
[50:50] for we which have believed to enter into
[50:52] rest as he said as I have sworn in my
[50:54] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[50:56] although the works were finished from
[50:58] the foundation of the world for he spake
[51:00] in a certain place on the seventh day on
[51:02] this wise and God did rest the seventh
[51:05] day from all his works and in this place
[51:07] again if they shall enter into my rest
[51:10] seeing therefore remaineth that that
[51:12] some must enter therein and they to whom
[51:14] it was first preached entered not in
[51:16] because of unbelief again he limited a
[51:18] certain day saying in David today after
[51:21] so long a time as it is said today if
[51:23] you'll hear his voice Harden not your
[51:26] hearts with Jesus had given them rest
[51:28] then would he not afterwards have spoken
[51:30] of another day there remaineth therefore
[51:32] a rest to the people of God for he that
[51:35] has entered into his rest he also he
[51:37] also has ceased from his own works as
[51:40] God did from his let us labor therefore
[51:42] to enter into that rest lest any man
[51:44] fall after the same example of unbelief
[51:48] now as I've said that rest is talking
[51:50] about is the true baptism of the Holy
[51:52] Ghost I mean that because that because
[51:54] when God comes and dwells in your Soul
[51:57] you cease from your own works it's not
[51:59] you trying to please God anymore it's
[52:00] not you trying to live the Christian
[52:01] life anymore no he comes and takes over
[52:04] amen amen amen he takes over your life
[52:06] as the Apostle Paul would say the life I
[52:09] now live I live by the faith of the Son
[52:11] of God Amen the life I now live I used
[52:13] to live a different kind of a life I was
[52:15] trying to be a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[52:17] I was trying to please Jehovah God in my
[52:18] own ability and what I learned and did
[52:20] and all these things but then one day I
[52:22] met him on the road to Damascus amen and
[52:24] he transformed my life amen the no I was
[52:27] no longer just learning about a god of
[52:28] history but he stepped out of history
[52:30] and he became alive to me and he showed
[52:32] me the scripture he's fulfilling in this
[52:34] day amen and he changed my life and was
[52:36] living in me am mean just swallow your
[52:38] chewing gum and join in the ride today
[52:40] amen so like so so he's saying that this
[52:42] rest we must enter into this rest now
[52:45] what is this rest this rest as I said is
[52:47] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost as
[52:49] the Apostle sorry as as Isaiah would
[52:51] prophesy in in in Isaiah 28 he says Whom
[52:55] Shall he teach knowledge and whom shall
[52:56] he make to understand Doctrine them that
[52:58] are weaned from the milk and drawn from
[53:00] the breasts for precept must be upon
[53:02] precept precept upon precept line upon
[53:04] line line upon line here a little there
[53:07] a little for stammering lips in another
[53:09] tongue will he speak to this people to
[53:11] whom he said this is the rest wherewith
[53:13] ye may cause the weary to rest and this
[53:15] is the refreshing yet they would not
[53:18] hear amen so on the day of Pentecost
[53:20] when the rest had fully come and the 120
[53:22] in the upper room were filled with the
[53:24] spirit of God they they out there like a
[53:27] bunch of drunk people I mean they're
[53:29] stammering and they shouting and
[53:31] praising God and acting like a bunch of
[53:32] drunk people because they're under the
[53:34] impact they became intoxicated amen by
[53:37] the by the Holy Ghost dwelling in them
[53:39] and the people on the outside said these
[53:40] people are drunk with new wine these
[53:43] people are drunk because they were
[53:45] staggering they were stammering with
[53:46] lips and and and what it was was the
[53:49] rest had come the true rest had come to
[53:52] the people of God Amen so it's not
[53:54] keeping a day it's not it's it's not you
[53:56] know a Sabbath keeping and all these
[53:58] things is so just for the reading but
[54:00] let's just I'm just want to read these
[54:01] things I'm sure we'll get off reading
[54:02] eventually but it says and whom also we
[54:04] are circumcised with the circumcision
[54:06] made without hands this is in Colossians
[54:08] 2 and putting off the body of the sins
[54:10] of the flesh by the circumcision of
[54:12] Christ buried with him in bapt baptism
[54:15] wherein also ye Arisen with him through
[54:17] the faith of the operation of God who
[54:19] raised him from the dead and you being
[54:21] dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
[54:23] of your flesh ha he quickened together
[54:25] with him having forgiven you all
[54:27] trespasses blotting out the handwriting
[54:30] of ordinances that was against us which
[54:31] was contrary to us and took it out of
[54:33] the way nailing it to his cross and
[54:35] having spoiled principalities and Powers
[54:38] he made a show of them openly triumphing
[54:40] over them in it let no man therefore
[54:42] judge you in meat or in drink or in
[54:44] respect of a holy day or a new moon or
[54:46] of the Sabbath days which are a shadow
[54:48] of things to come but the body is of
[54:50] Christ amen so he's saying don't let
[54:52] people judge you about what holid days
[54:55] you keep what feast days you keep all
[54:57] these kind of things you know that's
[54:58] just a shadow so why live in the shadow
[55:01] when you can have the reality I mean why
[55:03] have a shadow of keeping a Sabbath or
[55:05] just trying to be a good person good
[55:06] church person when you can live in the
[55:08] reality of the power of God and we come
[55:10] and live in your life and transform your
[55:12] life amen that you enter into a true
[55:16] rest hallelujah amen I was saying that
[55:19] this true rest is based
[55:21] completely uh it's it it's it this rest
[55:26] is is completely trusting in the ability
[55:28] of God Amen as as Ruth you if you read
[55:32] the book of Ruth it's the book of
[55:33] redemption it's not just a love story
[55:35] it's not just a nice uh you know nice
[55:38] love story they kind of slaughtered into
[55:40] the scripture but the book of redemption
[55:41] is in the Book of Ruth the whole Plan of
[55:44] Salvation for the whole world is in that
[55:46] book amen where where where there's the
[55:48] Redemption of the Gentile Ruth comes in
[55:51] she comes into Israel she's Redeemed by
[55:54] marriage to Boaz amen by her Union to
[55:56] Boaz um um she is redeemed and we know
[55:59] Boaz is a type of Jesus Christ Ruth is a
[56:01] gentile bride amen and through that
[56:03] Union then Naomi who's the who's the uh
[56:06] uh Israel is redeemed as well and then
[56:09] not only not only she is redeemed but
[56:11] then also the the the land they had
[56:14] before they left Israel and went into
[56:16] Moab is is redeemed right amen so so
[56:19] everything is restored by the end of the
[56:21] book of Ruth that they lost in the
[56:22] beginning and and and when when the
[56:25] whole word of God is complete When the
[56:27] eternity's Roll On The Devil's burning
[56:29] in the Lake of Fire a bunch of bunch of
[56:30] char in the bottom there gone and we're
[56:33] dancing around the Throne of God what's
[56:35] that the whole Plan of Redemption is
[56:37] complete amen so so within the four
[56:39] chapters of Ruth is actually the whole
[56:41] story of God's Plan of Redemption now
[56:43] there comes a stage we know the first
[56:45] stage of Ruth is is Ruth has to
[56:48] decide she's got to decide I'm going to
[56:50] follow you I mean when when Naomi was
[56:53] was um you know heard that there was
[56:54] food there was grain back in Israel she
[56:56] tells her two daughters-in-law that
[56:58] she's left with saying I'm going back to
[57:00] Israel you stay in Moab stay here go
[57:02] back to your father's house find someone
[57:04] else to marry I'm going home and then
[57:06] offer offer her um Ruth's other um
[57:09] Ruth's sister-in-law decides to stay
[57:12] turn back and go back to Moab you never
[57:14] hear about her again she weeps they weep
[57:16] she goes back but Ruth Ruth makes up her
[57:19] mind she says anomi your God be my God
[57:23] your people be my people where you die
[57:25] I'll die I'm following you I'm not I'm
[57:27] not turning around I'm not going back to
[57:29] the world I'm not going back to some
[57:30] religion I came out of I'm walking with
[57:32] you all the way I mean so she made up
[57:34] her mind and then ala said I mean sorry
[57:37] Nomi said she you know you said that she
[57:39] couldn't persuade her otherwise so she
[57:42] let her go with her so so there was a
[57:44] stage of her deciding I'm going to be a
[57:47] Christian I'm going to serve the Lord
[57:48] I'm going to give my life to the Lord
[57:49] Jesus Christ but then but but then there
[57:52] came a stage where she was working she
[57:53] was laboring she was in the field she
[57:55] was in has his field so she was in the
[57:57] right kind of field amen she was in the
[57:59] field of the word amen she was in the
[58:01] right kind of field amen amen but she
[58:03] was just just trying to scrape together
[58:05] a few blessings here and there a few
[58:07] scriptures and a few things to just to
[58:09] keep her going just to sustain her but
[58:11] that wasn't the end of her journey amen
[58:13] that that that was never meant to be the
[58:14] end of her journey because she found
[58:16] herself Grace brought her into boaz's
[58:19] field amen and the chief Reaper pointed
[58:21] um pointed out or introduced uh Boaz to
[58:25] Naomi
[58:26] and then Bo said to her stay in this
[58:29] field stay in this field but then there
[58:31] had to come now a time when Ruth stopped
[58:33] laboring and she came into rest amen now
[58:37] now this rest if we um this is this is
[58:40] Ruth chapter 3 I've just taken the first
[58:42] verse and the last few verses so she's
[58:46] been laboring in the field and Naomi
[58:48] knows that the field that she works in
[58:49] which is Boaz as is a near Kinsman unto
[58:52] her and we know the law of the kinsman
[58:54] redeemer in Israel is that someone had
[58:56] to uh uh in order to restore someone
[58:58] that have you know lost everything sold
[59:00] themselves into um um servitude or
[59:03] whatever that that a Kinsman had to
[59:05] there was a law that a Kinsman could
[59:06] redeem them and their property so the
[59:09] Kinsman had to be a blood
[59:10] relative had to be able to do it and and
[59:13] had to want to do it that was the that's
[59:16] the three criteria for a kinsman
[59:18] redeemer now we know our lord Jesus he
[59:21] had to be we had to be related to him
[59:24] and it's not this thing it's not not
[59:26] this thing it's this thing that makes us
[59:28] around doesn't matter what color you are
[59:30] doesn't matter where you're from
[59:31] language you speak that's got nothing to
[59:32] do with being related to our Lord Jesus
[59:34] Christ now there there's a SE Gene of
[59:37] predestination he puts on the inside of
[59:38] you before the foundation of the world
[59:40] am mean so he's got to be a relative to
[59:41] us that's why God became a man to redeem
[59:44] us amen cuz he had to fulfill his law
[59:47] right am mean he couldn't do it as an
[59:49] angel or the pillar of fire he had to
[59:50] become a man just like you and I amen
[59:53] and so and so he's related to us he he
[59:56] had to have the ability to do it our
[59:58] lord Jesus owns the universe in his
[1:00:01] veins is the purchasing power to break
[1:00:04] the power of sin amen the life of God is
[1:00:06] the only thing that can break the curse
[1:00:08] of sin amen so he had it in him so so so
[1:00:10] he is carrying the gold around if I
[1:00:12] could put it this way to do it but he
[1:00:14] had to be willing oh he was willing he
[1:00:17] was very willing to do it amen
[1:00:19] hallelujah why the joy sit before him
[1:00:21] that's why he went to Calvary she he was
[1:00:23] very willing to do it amen so so here is
[1:00:26] here is Nomi here speaking sorry just a
[1:00:28] bit of a background but um he says now
[1:00:30] noomi her her mother-in-law said unto
[1:00:32] her my daughter shall I not seek rest
[1:00:35] for thee that it may be well with thee
[1:00:37] so now the whole cycle is turning into
[1:00:39] Ruth must come to her rest Hallelujah
[1:00:43] and she lay and then and then and then
[1:00:45] and then n instructs Ruth to you know
[1:00:48] change her clothes whatever and then go
[1:00:50] down and find you'll find Boaz at the
[1:00:52] threshing floor and where where he is L
[1:00:56] down at his feet now this is just the
[1:00:57] earlier part of the chapter you can go
[1:00:59] away and read it and she lay at his feet
[1:01:01] until the morning she rose up before one
[1:01:03] could know another and he said let it
[1:01:05] not be known that a woman come down into
[1:01:07] the floor also he said bring the veil
[1:01:09] that thou Hast upon thee and and hold it
[1:01:12] and when she held it he measured six
[1:01:14] measures of Bley and laid it on her and
[1:01:17] he went and she went into the city now
[1:01:19] we know in the Bible there's six of a
[1:01:21] lot of things the seventh is always
[1:01:23] Christ so so Joshua would would
[1:01:26] Institute six Cities of Refuge in the
[1:01:28] promised land the seventh the true City
[1:01:31] of Refuge is Christ himself amen when
[1:01:33] Christ went to the went to the um
[1:01:35] wedding supper I mean you you know the
[1:01:37] marriage that had no wine he said get
[1:01:39] six pots for
[1:01:41] purification he's the seventh he's the
[1:01:44] source right he's the source that turned
[1:01:46] the water into wine right you know the
[1:01:48] woman at the well she had six husbands
[1:01:51] Christ was the true husband amen so it's
[1:01:55] like the Els the seventh is a mystery
[1:01:57] but it's Christ himself winding up his
[1:02:00] plan amen so when so when Boaz gave six
[1:02:03] measures of barley he's basically
[1:02:05] telling Ruth Ruth I'm the
[1:02:07] seventh these are little blessings but
[1:02:09] you're going to get everything
[1:02:10] Hallelujah when you're United to me yeah
[1:02:13] Hallelujah so now she could she could
[1:02:15] take that as a token or a promise and
[1:02:17] she went back to her mother-in-law amen
[1:02:20] praise God hallelujah now and then she
[1:02:23] came to her mother-in-law she said who
[1:02:24] art thou my daughter and she told her
[1:02:27] all that the man had done to her and she
[1:02:29] said these six measures of barley gave
[1:02:31] he me for he said to me go not empty
[1:02:34] unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit
[1:02:36] still my daughter until thou know how
[1:02:39] the matter will fall for the man will
[1:02:41] not be in rest until he has finished the
[1:02:44] thing this day amen so we enter into
[1:02:47] rest but our God's working amen and he
[1:02:50] will not rest until it's all wound up
[1:02:52] amen he will not cease until everything
[1:02:54] is done amen when you know I love those
[1:02:57] words in the Book of Revelation it is
[1:02:59] done hallelujah it is done amen there'll
[1:03:02] come a day when he says it it is done
[1:03:04] and it is done hallelujah amen but he
[1:03:07] will not rest until that day amen he
[1:03:09] will not he will not Slumber or sleep or
[1:03:11] rest or anything until his Plan of
[1:03:13] Redemption is done he is committed to
[1:03:16] his plan he has sold out to his plan and
[1:03:18] he's going to see it through am mean our
[1:03:20] lord Jesus is very determined am mean so
[1:03:23] now she could she could enter into rest
[1:03:25] because it was no longer Ruth trying to
[1:03:27] do anything it was now Boaz was stepping
[1:03:30] into his position as kinman Redeemer
[1:03:32] Hallelujah so amen so to me this is a
[1:03:35] glorious thing where now she's in the
[1:03:37] cycle of resting and then she goes from
[1:03:39] resting to
[1:03:41] rewarded amen but it's Boaz that does
[1:03:43] the whole thing you go read the book of
[1:03:45] Ruth there's a time where it's just Ruth
[1:03:46] and Nomi and and then there's a
[1:03:48] transition where Boaz comes in and then
[1:03:51] he takes over the story Hallelujah then
[1:03:53] he gets a hold of Ruth marries her
[1:03:55] redeems everything puts everything back
[1:03:57] how it should have been in the beginning
[1:03:59] Hallelujah and that's what our lord
[1:04:00] Jesus like us our book of life it
[1:04:03] started we just thought it was just all
[1:04:04] us and we found ourselves through
[1:04:07] through circumstances coming into his
[1:04:09] field coming into the message of the
[1:04:11] hour amen and then he what we find Grace
[1:04:13] in his sight and then we found out and
[1:04:15] then the word instructs us lay down at
[1:04:17] his feet where he's laying down and we
[1:04:20] go to Calvary we lay down at his
[1:04:22] feet amen and then it what then begins
[1:04:26] to move on our behalf he knew you before
[1:04:28] the foundation of the world he knew
[1:04:29] you'd come and lay there he knew you'd
[1:04:31] come down and lay there but he wants you
[1:04:33] to come into a state of rest and then
[1:04:35] what does he do he begins to do a work
[1:04:37] in your life he transforms your life he
[1:04:39] gives you Victory he proves his word
[1:04:42] amen he shows you who you really meant
[1:04:43] to be who you really are hallelujah amen
[1:04:47] I trust we're all happy today amen so
[1:04:49] she she enters into rest amen so what's
[1:04:52] she doing now she is resting and that
[1:04:55] rest only comes when you realize God's
[1:04:58] going to finish the
[1:04:59] job amen God's going to finish the job
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:04] hallelujah amen he says when the morning
[1:05:07] came way before the break of day she
[1:05:09] gathered up a great big bunch of barley
[1:05:10] six measures I believe it was put it in
[1:05:12] a little Shaw went home noi said my
[1:05:14] daughter after she raised up from the
[1:05:15] altar went back now what's going to
[1:05:17] happen mama what's going to take place
[1:05:19] now rest amen rest Ruth because the man
[1:05:21] will have no rest until he's done the
[1:05:23] full price of redemption amen amen
[1:05:26] right there's where I stand amen he'll
[1:05:27] not rest until he's done the full price
[1:05:29] of redemption to redeem you everything
[1:05:31] that you ever lost everything that you
[1:05:34] was he's going to restore it amen it's
[1:05:38] like you see you know it's amazing when
[1:05:40] you really see that God's able to do it
[1:05:43] it causes you to rest amen as as as um
[1:05:46] John was caught up in the spirit in the
[1:05:48] Lord's day he was taken up into the
[1:05:50] throne room of God and then he you know
[1:05:52] sees this great Throne uh scene of the
[1:05:54] Throne of God the 4 and 20 elders and
[1:05:57] different things around the
[1:05:59] throne and he sees that little book in
[1:06:02] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:06:03] throne sealed with Seven Seals and he
[1:06:05] heard a strong Angel proclaiming who's
[1:06:07] worthy to take the book but then John
[1:06:09] looks around he sees no man's worthy I
[1:06:12] mean to to take the book even to open it
[1:06:14] there's no man worthy and he weeping
[1:06:16] much because he knew that that PL that
[1:06:18] book was tied to the Plan of Redemption
[1:06:21] and and there was no but this scene
[1:06:23] isn't just the 4 and2 Elders John on the
[1:06:26] throne and these things now all the
[1:06:27] redeemed are encapsulated in the scene
[1:06:29] so all the prophets were there all the
[1:06:31] Believers were there didn't matter how
[1:06:32] holy and righteous they were no man was
[1:06:34] found worthy an angel could have done it
[1:06:37] but an angel didn't lose the didn't
[1:06:40] cause the fall it was man that allowed
[1:06:41] the fall to come so man would have to
[1:06:43] come and redeem it amen so John's
[1:06:45] weeping because he's not resting because
[1:06:48] he's not seeing the picture right he's
[1:06:49] not seeing the whole plan right amen
[1:06:51] he's all worried and stressed because
[1:06:53] wondering what's going to happen now
[1:06:54] because the whole creation himself is in
[1:06:57] Jeopardy because no one's found worthy
[1:06:59] but then one of the one of the elders
[1:07:01] turned to him and said no no you can
[1:07:02] rest John don't weep John don't weep
[1:07:06] over your situation John don't be caught
[1:07:09] up in what's going on right now John I'm
[1:07:11] going to show you something to look at
[1:07:13] that you can rest in amen he says that
[1:07:16] behold the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:07:18] amen has prevailed to open the book and
[1:07:20] loose the Seven Seals amen and then and
[1:07:22] then and then I don't have the scripture
[1:07:24] here but I think verse six says that he
[1:07:25] looked and he saw the lamb he saw the
[1:07:28] one he walked with the shores of Galilee
[1:07:30] he saw the one that Rose Lazarus from
[1:07:32] the grave he saw the one that he saw
[1:07:34] that resurrected out of the Grave
[1:07:36] himself he saw the one that he laid on
[1:07:38] his bosom that he loved and loved him
[1:07:41] and then now he could he could rest amen
[1:07:43] he could rest that now that now the Plan
[1:07:46] of Redemption will be completed because
[1:07:48] the worthy one he walked with was now
[1:07:50] the worthy one that was going to finish
[1:07:52] what he started hallelujah amen so he's
[1:07:54] going to finish what he started and then
[1:07:56] so his weeping turned into worship His
[1:07:59] weeping turned into rejoicing amen he
[1:08:02] did not keep his voice silent he
[1:08:04] couldn't keep himself silent when he saw
[1:08:05] the lamb step forth amen he said
[1:08:07] blessing everything in Earth under the
[1:08:09] earth and the Sea and all those
[1:08:10] everything basically said heard me
[1:08:12] saying blessing and honor glory and
[1:08:13] power be unto him that sth upon the
[1:08:15] throne and unto the lamb forever and
[1:08:17] ever amen he saw but then also in that
[1:08:20] scene he saw himself there redeemed
[1:08:22] already hallelujah amen so he could have
[1:08:25] a jubilee cuz he was resting God's able
[1:08:27] to I may be repeating myself the needle
[1:08:30] will move on the thing eventually you
[1:08:32] know but but we need to rest in what
[1:08:35] God's doing prise the Lord amen because
[1:08:38] because now John could have confidence
[1:08:40] that God's going to finish his plan amen
[1:08:43] so what he started he will perfect amen
[1:08:45] and it's the same thing with you and I
[1:08:47] what he started he's going to finish it
[1:08:50] am mean what he finished what he started
[1:08:51] he's going to finish it amen and he's
[1:08:53] going to finish it how he wants to
[1:08:55] finish it amen so if he saw you made in
[1:08:57] His image before the foundation of the
[1:08:58] world that's how you're going to end up
[1:09:00] amen but we've got to we've got a rest
[1:09:02] that he's going to do it amen now in
[1:09:04] order to be resting and fighting we've
[1:09:06] got to be drawing strength from his
[1:09:08] promises amen we can't be drawing
[1:09:10] strength from you don't draw strength
[1:09:11] from doubt or unbelief or any of these
[1:09:13] things no we must draw strength from him
[1:09:17] right we must draw strength from him
[1:09:18] amen because you look at you look at you
[1:09:21] look at Caleb now Caleb was
[1:09:23] resting he was resting when Moses came
[1:09:26] into Egypt he was resting when he walked
[1:09:28] across the Red Sea he was resting by
[1:09:30] Mount Si he was resting when he looked
[1:09:32] at the land he was resting he said let's
[1:09:34] go take it at once he was resting for 40
[1:09:37] years in the wilderness waiting for his
[1:09:39] day he didn't sit back and say someone
[1:09:41] else to do it he says give me a piece he
[1:09:44] said to Moses he's 84 years old I'm as
[1:09:46] strong now as I was then amen why cuz he
[1:09:50] was drawing strength off the promise God
[1:09:53] told me I'm going to dwell on that
[1:09:54] mountain God told me that Mountain's
[1:09:56] mind God told me my children are going
[1:09:58] to live there and he drew strength off
[1:09:59] that promise that he wasn't going to
[1:10:01] perish in the wilderness that God gave
[1:10:03] him Faith Revelation and because he
[1:10:05] received that Revelation he was resting
[1:10:07] amen I trust it's the same thing with
[1:10:09] you and I he's given you Revelation see
[1:10:11] we got to realize we've seen the end of
[1:10:13] the picture amen if you've receiv
[1:10:15] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:17] the true seal of God you're sealed to
[1:10:19] the day of your Redemption amen so
[1:10:21] therefore you know your
[1:10:23] destination Hallelujah so if you know
[1:10:25] your destination why why not rest in the
[1:10:28] today amen if he's got your end sorted
[1:10:30] he's got the everyday sorted he's got
[1:10:32] every battle lined up for you to get a
[1:10:34] victory out of amen that's why that's
[1:10:36] why Caleb knew my destination children
[1:10:39] is there maybe going Google Maps we're
[1:10:42] traveling here this place is mine I've
[1:10:44] already renamed it on Google Maps this
[1:10:46] is my home address this mountain amen
[1:10:49] and my my home address is not here it's
[1:10:51] in glory but Caleb knew nothing could
[1:10:53] stop him until he he receives that
[1:10:55] inheritance because God quickened it to
[1:10:57] his soul so he could rest Hallelujah he
[1:11:00] fought a lot of battles and it wasn't
[1:11:02] shooting from a trench somewhere this is
[1:11:04] right in the person's face there been a
[1:11:07] lot of enemies maybe a lot of close
[1:11:08] calls but he could rest in the battle I
[1:11:11] can't die here I can't die here I got to
[1:11:14] go live there I ain't living there yet
[1:11:17] so I can't die here are you with me amen
[1:11:20] David knew he was anointed to go sit on
[1:11:21] the throne he had a lot of time of
[1:11:23] trouble he had a lot of struggles he had
[1:11:25] lot of things going on but he encouraged
[1:11:27] himself in the Lord that God had
[1:11:29] anointed him by a prophet that he's
[1:11:31] going to sit on the throne so when he's
[1:11:33] sitting in zigg the place in ashes his
[1:11:35] family is gone his men's family is gone
[1:11:38] they thinking of stoning him I mean he
[1:11:40] encouraged himself in the Lord because
[1:11:42] he realized I'm not on the throne
[1:11:44] yet I've been anointed to sit there I'm
[1:11:47] not been anointed just to sit here in
[1:11:48] ashes I've been anointed to sit there so
[1:11:50] he could encourage himself he drew
[1:11:52] strength he didn't draw you can't draw
[1:11:54] strength from wor worry questions
[1:11:57] trouble doubt that just weakens Faith am
[1:12:00] me but he he allowed us strength he
[1:12:02] allowed us Faith to take over by
[1:12:04] encouraging himself in the Lord amen and
[1:12:07] then so what happened now is that rest
[1:12:09] he was resting in because the atmosphere
[1:12:12] he generated went upon his
[1:12:14] men
[1:12:16] Hallelujah men this is a bad spot I
[1:12:19] don't know what he would have said but
[1:12:20] maybe something like this Brothers
[1:12:23] remember when you found me in the cave
[1:12:26] Brothers remember when you felt the
[1:12:28] anointing on me come upon you Brothers
[1:12:31] remember the day you became giant
[1:12:32] Killers Brothers you remember the day
[1:12:34] that God has given us great victories he
[1:12:37] ain't going to leave us
[1:12:38] now he anointed me to be on the throne
[1:12:42] I'm going to get there how you going to
[1:12:44] get there David he's going to I'm
[1:12:45] resting in the fact he's going to get me
[1:12:47] there I'm resting in the fact that he's
[1:12:49] going to get me on the throne and so
[1:12:51] that rest now went into them what should
[1:12:53] we do pray yes they to pray Hallelujah
[1:12:59] and what happened God said go pursue
[1:13:01] you'll recover all Hallelujah so they
[1:13:03] could all rest in the fact we're getting
[1:13:05] them back they didn't just sit there and
[1:13:06] say well if God's going to do it God's
[1:13:08] going to do it and if he doesn't do it
[1:13:09] he's not going to do no that's not
[1:13:10] resting that's unbelief speaking no
[1:13:12] faith says it's mine faith says the
[1:13:14] promise is mine faith says now is the
[1:13:16] day now is the day for Liberation now is
[1:13:19] the day for deliverance
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:23] hallelujah amen
[1:13:26] praise God Abraham Abraham would would
[1:13:28] would come to a place of rest in his
[1:13:30] walk with God in the 17th chapter of
[1:13:33] Genesis God would God would appear to
[1:13:35] Abraham say I'm the almighty God the
[1:13:37] strong one now if you look into the
[1:13:38] definition of that um name there the
[1:13:41] almighty God uh part of the meaning of
[1:13:43] it is uh you know it's from the word El
[1:13:46] Shai and that doesn't just mean the
[1:13:48] strong one it means like the breasted
[1:13:50] God like a mother breastfeeding her baby
[1:13:54] so God is telling Abraham Abraham nurse
[1:13:57] off the promise nurse off my word nurse
[1:14:00] draw strength from me Hallelujah you
[1:14:03] can't fulfill it in your own strength so
[1:14:05] you need a source of strength and here I
[1:14:08] am amen your source of strength is not
[1:14:11] the economy or what's going on in life
[1:14:13] my I am your source of strength Abraham
[1:14:16] so draw strength out of my word draw
[1:14:19] strength out of the anointing and you'll
[1:14:21] find your body begin to change you'll
[1:14:23] find Faith begin to rise just rest at my
[1:14:28] bosom and

[1:14:32] you'll begin to rest cuz you're drawing
[1:14:34] strength from me amen hallelujah you say
[1:14:38] does that really work who's ever felt
[1:14:40] such a rest when we're at say camp for

[1:14:53] drinking from Al should I right so now
[1:14:55] you're resting and you're drawing
[1:14:57] strength for the promise and that's what
[1:14:58] we've got to keep doing amen now I heard
[1:15:01] brother Tim P mentioned this um and this
[1:15:04] is from this is from this is part of the
[1:15:06] letter that brother brah was sent out
[1:15:08] with a prayer cloth they said he had
[1:15:09] more success with prayer cloth and
[1:15:11] healings from them than even just the
[1:15:13] ministry so there's a lot of Miracles
[1:15:15] that happened with the prayer cloth sent
[1:15:16] out and so in the instruction he said we
[1:15:19] are not to be occupied with our feelings
[1:15:21] or symptoms of our faith or or lack of
[1:15:24] faith but only with what God has said
[1:15:27] amen that's how you rest i' I've shared
[1:15:29] this with a few people thought well I'm
[1:15:30] going to share it with everyone cuz I
[1:15:31] like this we're not to be occupied with
[1:15:34] our feelings our feelings lie our
[1:15:37] feelings don't give you strength our
[1:15:39] feelings help no one you know oh I'm
[1:15:42] happy sad up and down I'm going to make
[1:15:43] it not going to make it I feel this I
[1:15:45] feel that forget that forget that no or
[1:15:49] our oh do I have enough Faith or do I
[1:15:51] not who's got the faith meter that they
[1:15:54] can just
[1:15:56] like some app no no one has that so
[1:15:58] don't be occupied with well can I
[1:16:00] believe for this and can do I have faith
[1:16:01] for this no we have to you don't get
[1:16:04] strength from that because you're
[1:16:05] looking at you and what you perceive you
[1:16:08] as amen but if you're looking at his
[1:16:10] promises if you occupy yourself with
[1:16:12] what he has said I mean then what are
[1:16:15] you doing you're drinking from Al Shai
[1:16:17] and you're getting strength from him
[1:16:19] amen so let's be occupied with what God
[1:16:21] has said amen you know the human mind
[1:16:24] has only so much uh capacity mine's like
[1:16:28] this it's not big well I should feel
[1:16:32] that with what he has said amen amen
[1:16:35] with what he has said not what I think
[1:16:37] or this person says or this person feels
[1:16:39] no what does he said I'm going to occupy
[1:16:43] myself with that yeah amen now the
[1:16:45] simple way is to begin calling the thing
[1:16:48] we have prayed for ours and to thank God
[1:16:51] for them before we feel or see the
[1:16:53] answer God is faithful he cannot deny
[1:16:56] himself the word of God tells us when we
[1:16:58] pray believe mark 11:24 we must believe
[1:17:03] that we have the answer even though we
[1:17:05] neither see it nor feel it that we have
[1:17:07] it amen God says now Faith is it's
[1:17:10] Hebrews 11:1 not faith shall be for that
[1:17:14] would only be hoping for and not and not
[1:17:17] present tense believing and having faith
[1:17:19] begins now amen so why not start resting
[1:17:23] now why not let God take over now or one
[1:17:26] day when I'm old what about now what
[1:17:29] about at this age this age is a good age

[1:27:20] where the dead and Christ are going to
[1:27:21] raise oh one day it'll happen no this is
[1:27:23] the season
[1:27:24] this world is this
[1:27:26] close to the Great Tribulation this
[1:27:29] world has fallen apart it's not falling
[1:27:31] apart it has fallen apart the wheels are
[1:27:34] off the bus the bus is in the in the
[1:27:36] ditch it's on fire it's upside down
[1:27:38] that's how the world is oh someone's
[1:27:40] going to fix
[1:27:41] it no oh this is no it's not we are
[1:27:45] preparing to leave this world but as
[1:27:48] we're preparing to leave amen let's get
[1:27:50] everyone we can on the Gospel Ship amen
[1:27:53] let's fight for every soul see we're
[1:27:55] going to see Lord you saved me you when
[1:27:58] I first met God I thought everyone's
[1:28:00] going to believe this I was just so sold
[1:28:03] out I just thought man Jesus is Alive
[1:28:06] why cuz he stepped I didn't have a
[1:28:07] religion I met Christ he changed my life
[1:28:10] I was a drunk I was doing all kind of
[1:28:11] things to the world you would have
[1:28:12] written me off a long time ago but he
[1:28:14] found me and transformed me all I had
[1:28:17] was the Bible in the message didn't have
[1:28:19] a church didn't have someone to tell me
[1:28:20] what to do God told me what to do God
[1:28:22] guided me amen God found me he saved me
[1:28:24] he cleansed me he kept me amen I
[1:28:26] realized he lives Hallelujah so what
[1:28:30] then you begin to testify you begin to
[1:28:32] share you going to be a witness amen why
[1:28:34] because if he saved me he can do it for
[1:28:37] anyone Hallelujah so Caleb would have
[1:28:39] thought well if God's going to be give
[1:28:41] me this mountain he's going to give all
[1:28:42] of Israel their inheritance so I'm going
[1:28:44] to help you out in your in your battle
[1:28:47] amen amen that's why we must never I'm
[1:28:49] just that I I'll probably pick this up
[1:28:52] another time but I'm just going to close
[1:28:54] with this
[1:28:55] thought let's not quit am let's not quit
[1:29:00] if you're resting you will be fighting
[1:29:02] amen if you're really resting in Christ
[1:29:04] you will be fighting amen if you're not
[1:29:06] resting you'll just be worrying right or
[1:29:09] can he do it am I really his am I really
[1:29:11] his child no but when he reveals himself
[1:29:13] to you remember the book of Galatians
[1:29:16] says because you are Sons you receive
[1:29:19] the Holy Ghost because you are you don't
[1:29:21] become a son or daughter by the new
[1:29:22] birth you receive the new birth cuz you
[1:29:25] are amen so that should take all the
[1:29:27] worry out of our lives I'm his child he
[1:29:29] can't lose one of them that's the one
[1:29:31] thing God can't do he can't lose one of
[1:29:33] his children he can't lie he can't he
[1:29:35] can't fail there's lot things he can't
[1:29:37] do but that's one of the things he can't
[1:29:38] do is lose one of his so if I'm one of
[1:29:40] his he's going to get a hold of me maybe
[1:29:43] I'm got to go through a lot of dealings
[1:29:44] and a lot of buckl a lot of things to
[1:29:46] get back on the road but hey he's going
[1:29:48] to correct me as long as I'm his child
[1:29:50] he's going to keep me on the road
[1:29:52] Hallelujah but if I'm his I'm his well
[1:29:54] let's press the battle Lord where are we
[1:29:56] going today it's like Jonathan's armor
[1:29:58] Bearer I think Jonathan was the only one
[1:30:00] with the sword right the Philistines are
[1:30:03] up I think mishmash they had a Garrison
[1:30:05] and Saul sitting there in the camp
[1:30:06] backsliding saying no one can eat
[1:30:07] anything and you know Joshua say to's
[1:30:10] armor Bearer let's go let's go check out
[1:30:11] the enemy and then and then and then so
[1:30:14] so the armor Bearer says okay Lord I'm
[1:30:15] coming with you basically the God God
[1:30:17] says let's go into this let's walk here
[1:30:20] I'm coming with you I'll carry the
[1:30:21] armor what do you I'm just carry his
[1:30:24] armor he does the fighting I carry the
[1:30:26] armor the armor Bearer had to go with
[1:30:29] you Jonathan if you look there um
[1:30:31] actually know where the battle fought
[1:30:32] it's like upper Cliff was the Garrison
[1:30:34] and Jonathan and his armor bear had to
[1:30:36] go up on their hands and feet and then
[1:30:38] so Jonathan said to the armor Bearer I
[1:30:39] might get this the wrong way like I
[1:30:40] normally mix things up if I have two
[1:30:42] options but basically I think Jonathan
[1:30:44] says the Amor be now if they if they say
[1:30:48] come up God's given us the battle if not
[1:30:51] then we haven't got the battle so so the
[1:30:53] Philistines see them climbing up and
[1:30:55] then and then the Philistines say come
[1:30:57] up here and Jonathan says we got the
[1:31:00] battle so the armor Bearer carrying
[1:31:02] Jonathan's Armor gets up there
[1:31:03] Jonathan's the one that has the
[1:31:05] sword and of course eventually the AR be
[1:31:08] gets the sword but what I'm trying to
[1:31:09] say is just go with God and he'll fight
[1:31:11] the battle for you and they won a great
[1:31:13] Victory right what if the what if the
[1:31:16] amaba was not resting in Jonathan's
[1:31:18] leadership oh Prince Jonathan I don't
[1:31:20] know if we should do that you know your
[1:31:22] father said we got to stay in the camp
[1:31:23] and do all these things now he said look
[1:31:25] we're won where you go Jonathan I'm
[1:31:27] going what battle you press into I'm
[1:31:30] right there with you Hallelujah I'll
[1:31:32] carry the shield of Faith I've I've got
[1:31:33] the full armor of God I'm coming with
[1:31:34] you Jonathan and they won a mighty
[1:31:36] victory that day why because the armor
[1:31:38] Bearer went with Jonathan you want to
[1:31:40] see a mighty Victory go with Christ go
[1:31:43] with Christ amen follow him into the
[1:31:45] battle amen he will fight it for you
[1:31:47] don't hide don't quit don't be silent
[1:31:51] don't let this don't let this confess
[1:31:53] negative let it confess positive am me
[1:31:55] because if you are if you are occupied
[1:31:58] if that was the word if you occupied
[1:32:00] yourselves in the promises of God then
[1:32:03] what's in has to come out amen if you're
[1:32:06] occupied with that he is more than able
[1:32:08] amen that he his word is faithful and
[1:32:10] true and that his promises are yay and
[1:32:12] amen and you go into specific promises
[1:32:15] what's in here will come out am what
[1:32:17] were you reading the other day Jesus
[1:32:19] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:32:20] forever amen amen what are you reading
[1:32:22] the other day he's my high priest of my
[1:32:24] profession I'm resting in the fact that
[1:32:26] when I confess or profess his word to
[1:32:27] him he starts acting on my behalf amen
[1:32:30] that he's the one who steps down and and
[1:32:32] makes it
[1:32:33] fulfilled amen so are we resting we'll
[1:32:38] come into the other part of it probably
[1:32:39] another time then you're fighting
[1:32:41] hallelujah amen and you have complete
[1:32:44] rest in the battle that God's going to
[1:32:47] do it how when why that's him but if God
[1:32:52] said so God said so amen if he's more
[1:32:54] than able he's more than able if he is
[1:32:57] able to do that which he has promised
[1:32:58] he's going to do it don't let the devil
