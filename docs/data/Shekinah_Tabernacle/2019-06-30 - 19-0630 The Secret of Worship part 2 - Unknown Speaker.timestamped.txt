[55:55] samuel chapter 6 verse 11 through 2:16
[55:59] we're going to read and it says here 2nd
[56:01] samuel chapter 6 11 and the ark of the
[56:05] lord continued in the house of obed-edom
[56:07] that gets height three months and the
[56:10] Lord blessed open Edom and all his
[56:11] household I just want you to pay careful
[56:13] attention where the art represents the
[56:16] presence of God and the fullness of his
[56:18] word amongst the people right that's
[56:20] what it represents and so here is this
[56:24] man and he ends up with verse in his

[56:30] fullness of the word and the presence of
[56:32] God is in your house you cannot not be

[56:50] time and I believe that we are children

[57:18] bring this why weird the way I'm angling
[57:20] the scripture here is is David as your
[57:26] eternal images your new nature your new
[57:29] man you know your new identity right so
[57:31] Dave is your new identity and McCall is
[57:34] your restricted old nature that is
[57:38] subject to politics cultures and the old
[57:42] nature of course is cursed by the fall
[57:44] so there's the two natures now we're not
[57:46] where this whole thing is going to be
[57:49] internalized inside each one of us okay
[57:53] so when you read that you just think
[57:55] about that alright and we'll
[57:57] go through it and it was told King David
[57:59] saying the Lord has blessed the house of
[58:01] obed-edom and all that pertain earth
[58:03] unto him because the Ark of God because
[58:07] of the Ark of God amen so David went and
[58:11] brought up the Ark of God from the house
[58:13] of Odin Edom into the City of David with
[58:16] Glenn amen how could you not Amen
[58:19] because this is the desire of God for so
[58:22] many years that his presence would come
[58:25] to Jerusalem
[58:26] amen hallelujah so you can see these two
[58:29] people very excited more but David and
[58:31] God were very happy about this occasion
[58:33] they want this is what this is what
[58:35] needed to happen and it was so that when
[58:40] they bought beer the Ark of the Lord had
[58:43] gone when they had there had beer the
[58:45] Ark of the Lord had gone six places he
[58:47] sacrificed opsins and fatlings and David
[58:50] danced before the Lord amen
[58:53] with all not some not 90% but everybody
[58:59] say all all has might Amen when I read
[59:05] that I thought men are that's why I
[59:06] always say spend all your energy on her
[59:08] name don't hold anything back whether it
[59:11] comes out of your mouth or it's inside
[59:13] here just spend it all amen hallelujah
[59:17] hallelujah amen and David was girded
[59:20] with a linen ephod so David and all the
[59:23] house of Israel brought up the Ark of
[59:25] the Lord with shouting and with the
[59:28] sound of the trumpet amen there's always
[59:31] shouting when there's a sound of a
[59:33] trumpet now we know in the scripture
[59:34] prophetically trumpets generally denotes
[59:37] the gospel going forth the truth going
[59:40] force the voice of the Lord declaring
[59:42] freedom for his people and war for his
[59:45] enemy amen and there's always shouting
[59:48] that goes with it
[59:49] amen it just goes hand in hand it's like
[59:52] wine and oil amen
[59:53] hallelujah it just goes together now
[59:57] second into verse 16 it says and as the
[1:00:00] Ark of the Lord came into the city of
[1:00:02] David McCall Saul's daughter and that's
[1:00:05] Keith at Saul's daughter now David
[1:00:07] thought he had finished with the enemy
[1:00:10] that conflicts men then had held him
[1:00:13] back and you know but had carried on the
[1:00:16] legacy continued a little bit down
[1:00:18] through came into his house even oh my
[1:00:21] oh my you see we thought we had we
[1:00:25] thought we had finished at all and then
[1:00:27] all of a sudden something happens in
[1:00:29] your like oh wow I haven't actually
[1:00:30] conquered that one yet it's still going
[1:00:33] you know the battle Stallone hallelujah
[1:00:35] amen the battle still on and the enemy
[1:00:38] will try and get you to the bitter end
[1:00:40] until he's cast into the lake of fire
[1:00:42] he's gonna try and get you he's trying
[1:00:45] but he can't and he's so mad because he
[1:00:48] can't because the Lord he didn't let the
[1:00:51] devil win they man no no no no
[1:00:53] hallelujah amen and so it says and as
[1:00:58] the afterworld came into the city of
[1:00:59] David McCall Saul's daughter looked
[1:01:01] through a look at me look at me look
[1:01:04] through a window okay
[1:01:06] he looked through a window now the
[1:01:08] window she looked through a window and
[1:01:10] saw King David leaping and dancing
[1:01:14] before the Lord and she despised him in
[1:01:17] her heart
[1:01:19] may the Lord adders blessing to the
[1:01:21] reading of his word you may be seated in
[1:01:23] the presence of the Lord hey man
[1:01:25] well hallelujah you know I'm quite
[1:01:29] nervous actually but you know the Lord
[1:01:31] is gracious amen and I just have prayed
[1:01:34] a lot actually how the Lord will deliver
[1:01:36] this because in my heart I want to IIIi
[1:01:39] really feel of the law to to move right
[1:01:42] through all my notes this time and you
[1:01:44] know what it's like for me it's very
[1:01:45] difficult to get through your notes
[1:01:47] actually almost anyone that ministers
[1:01:50] you know they have struggles to get
[1:01:53] through all their notes you know because
[1:01:54] you there's just so much in the word and
[1:01:56] there's so much that you just get so
[1:01:58] excited about things then and you just
[1:02:01] take one scripture and it can open up
[1:02:03] everything you know but we have to now I
[1:02:06] just really feel we're just gonna do
[1:02:07] some reading Amen Alleluia
[1:02:11] so McCall inside look through the window
[1:02:19] and saw David the new nature the one
[1:02:23] that's rejoicing the one that's been to
[1:02:25] camp the one that went to the that goes
[1:02:27] to these convictions and jumps out all
[1:02:29] of a sudden while it's all on and all go
[1:02:32] then McCall sees something inside
[1:02:34] looking through what an earth are you
[1:02:36] doing you didn't do these things before
[1:02:39] this is not what you made of this is not
[1:02:43] what you were brought up like you are
[1:02:45] shamelessly uncovering yourself and I
[1:02:48] thought my when I read that I thought
[1:02:49] she just said something very he was
[1:02:52] shamelessly uncovering himself he was
[1:02:55] shamelessly uncovering his eternal self
[1:02:58] he was shamelessly uncovering what he
[1:03:01] was before the world was ever formed a
[1:03:03] man that's the oldest religion there is
[1:03:06] that who knows what the oldest religion
[1:03:08] here is does anybody know what the
[1:03:10] oldest religion mirrors
[1:03:12] now when I say religion and just two
[1:03:14] let's do some glossary when I say
[1:03:16] religion I don't mean the man controlled
[1:03:20] restricted type of religion I'm talking
[1:03:22] about the word religion as an expression
[1:03:27] of an inward faith so it's the outward
[1:03:29] works they're the fruits of an inward
[1:03:32] life that is what that's what what the
[1:03:35] word religion means I mean I know that
[1:03:37] in Christendom they've kind of
[1:03:40] diminished the word the religion to a
[1:03:43] negative thing and it can be a negative
[1:03:45] thing we can become just religious
[1:03:47] without the inner life it can be an
[1:03:49] outward shell but there's nothing on the
[1:03:51] inside but we don't want that and I
[1:03:54] don't believe we have that but we are
[1:03:56] susceptible to that and so if there's
[1:03:59] anything I say today that may seem like
[1:04:03] I'm trying it's negative or anything
[1:04:05] that's not that I'm trying to say that
[1:04:07] we've got that better it's an exposure
[1:04:09] of the enemy that will try and make us
[1:04:11] like that so it's always good to know
[1:04:13] his devices and expose him preempt him
[1:04:18] you know and we all fight it and we have
[1:04:20] our seasons sometimes I mean let me just
[1:04:23] share some of you the last time I
[1:04:24] preached this
[1:04:25] the first part I have suffered thick and
[1:04:28] thin until now and I'll probably suffer
[1:04:32] some more but but by the Lord's grace
[1:04:34] you know as you get challenged
[1:04:36] challenged so I've going around this
[1:04:38] thing the other time my shirt hanging
[1:04:40] out and I'm just man I just
[1:04:42] it was just out leaving I couldn't
[1:04:43] believe it I watched some of the videos
[1:04:45] he I can't believe it was me
[1:04:47] it was Michael looking at these windows
[1:04:49] go what the heck are you doing here but
[1:04:52] you know and I and what I was saying was
[1:04:55] you know the bet every divine expression
[1:04:58] God's Word has an appropriate reaction
[1:05:01] you know there's a reaction to his when
[1:05:03] he's looking for that he's looking for
[1:05:06] response he's looking for love he's
[1:05:08] looking for a reaction to his word
[1:05:10] because it's his thought and that's so
[1:05:13] and I'm like you know this is this and
[1:05:15] then man
[1:05:16] oh my I'd be sitting in the service and
[1:05:18] the devil is attacking trying to stop me
[1:05:21] from actually practicing what I just
[1:05:23] preached really strongly to it was hard
[1:05:26] my goodness you just have to fight
[1:05:28] you've got to push him back no matter
[1:05:31] how hard those thoughts they make you
[1:05:32] feel so negative they make you feel so
[1:05:34] down you have to push back you might not
[1:05:38] feel like pushing back in here and you
[1:05:40] might think it's hopeless to push back
[1:05:41] but just push back push the devil back
[1:05:44] because God did not let the devil win he
[1:05:47] didn't let the devil win hey man and if
[1:05:50] he has gone and taken something now you
[1:05:52] need to go into the enemy's camp and
[1:05:54] take back what he stole from you amen
[1:05:57] hallelujah amen so you see McCall now
[1:06:03] looking through saying you shamelessly
[1:06:05] uncovered yourself because now David was
[1:06:07] caught up in a thought he was caught up
[1:06:11] in such a thought his perception of what
[1:06:14] was happening there was different from
[1:06:16] shimmie eyes perception shimmie eyes
[1:06:18] perception was on man what's going on
[1:06:20] here this is they're just trying to work
[1:06:22] it all up
[1:06:23] Joe waves four six and once we've got
[1:06:25] more treasure in Jerusalem there because
[1:06:26] that thing's worth a lot of money in
[1:06:28] gold and whatever so you these different
[1:06:30] perceptions they weren't dancing around
[1:06:32] the art were they amen
[1:06:34] there was McCord perception she didn't
[1:06:36] eat she was just had her eyes off the
[1:06:37] Lord and she was looking at
[1:06:39] at the fellow believers so her
[1:06:41] perception was all I love he says having
[1:06:43] a good time Oh shamelessly uncovered but
[1:06:46] my David had a perception he perceives
[1:06:50] something great was taking place
[1:06:53] so if show me I had a perception and
[1:06:56] what he saw was such and what Joab saw
[1:06:58] was such and what McCall saw was such
[1:07:01] and what David saw was such what do you
[1:07:03] see because that same ah must come into
[1:07:08] your Jerusalem your Jerusalem is your
[1:07:13] heart when that comes into your
[1:07:16] Jerusalem the fullness of the word the
[1:07:18] manifestation of everything that God has
[1:07:20] the Adam lost and the spoken word comes
[1:07:24] in to fully give you everything that God
[1:07:26] has promised in this endtime hour before
[1:07:29] before the rapture there will be a full
[1:07:32] manifestation of the sons of God again
[1:07:34] coming to their adoption okay when that
[1:07:38] comes into your Jerusalem and I'm gonna
[1:07:41] bring this right into context right at
[1:07:43] the end you come to your full adoption
[1:07:46] and say this but when you receive the
[1:07:50] Holy Ghost you're receiving the spirit
[1:07:53] of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father
[1:07:55] there is the spirit of adoption to bring
[1:07:59] you to your adoption
[1:08:00] he's the tutor he's the teacher he's the
[1:08:03] deliverer he's the comforter because he
[1:08:05] knows that you're gonna go through some
[1:08:07] hard battles you're going to go through
[1:08:08] some really deep valleys and that you're
[1:08:11] gonna need a comforter you're gonna need
[1:08:12] a deliverer you're gonna need a teacher
[1:08:14] you're gonna need a guide through the
[1:08:17] darkest ages and the darkest times and
[1:08:19] the most perilous seas that are just
[1:08:21] going boisterous you'll need the spirit
[1:08:24] of adoption that would take you through
[1:08:27] that journey right across your life
[1:08:29] until finally you come to the heart of
[1:08:33] the earth the heart of your earth right
[1:08:36] there is where it all comes now I'll
[1:08:40] stop there with that and we'll come and
[1:08:42] revisit that later
[1:08:45] see if this works yeah here we go
[1:08:55] so sick and Samuel sucks first witnesses
[1:08:57] then David returned to bless his
[1:08:59] household and McCall the daughter of
[1:09:01] Saul came out to meet David and said how
[1:09:04] glorious was the king of Israel today
[1:09:06] you know there is the Bible has sarcasm
[1:09:09] his sarcasm right here how glorious was
[1:09:13] the king of Israel today who shamelessly
[1:09:15] uncovered himself who's been through
[1:09:18] that before who's had that experience
[1:09:20] you know it might happen in the church
[1:09:22] but you just say don't care I'm going
[1:09:23] anyway
[1:09:24] I'm having a good time hey man I'm up
[1:09:26] here I don't worry about what anyone
[1:09:28] thinks I'm having a good time
[1:09:29] and then you know and you still battle a
[1:09:32] little bit there and you know you could
[1:09:33] stand in you feel like these eyes
[1:09:34] burning into your back you're watching
[1:09:37] you you never stood up before you never
[1:09:39] raised your hands before this burning in
[1:09:41] your back
[1:09:42] let's McCall telling you she's speaking
[1:09:44] come on if it you pushed it away and you
[1:09:48] do it anyway but then when you get home
[1:09:49] when you get home it gets worse what did
[1:09:53] you do you shamelessly uncovered
[1:09:56] yourself my that's what you did amen
[1:10:01] because way back when I read my book of
[1:10:03] Revelation when I read the book of
[1:10:05] Revelation I see a church I see a church
[1:10:09] having a very good time actually they're
[1:10:11] not talking they're not they're really
[1:10:13] shutting they're really praising amen
[1:10:16] you know why because the McCall never
[1:10:19] came up in the rapture only only David
[1:10:23] came in the rapture amen only that new
[1:10:25] nature comes up in the rapture Bissell
[1:10:28] curse pissed house that holds us down
[1:10:29] stays down here
[1:10:31] that's why up there they're reflecting
[1:10:33] the oldest religion in the world which
[1:10:36] is the shouting religious brother Brando
[1:10:42] I'll read the coin in a minute very good
[1:10:45] that's this here this you're what you're
[1:10:49] doing now is you know you're having this
[1:10:50] that there's an internal fight going on
[1:10:53] because you see the devil does not want
[1:10:56] us to shamelessly uncover ourselves now
[1:10:58] I'm speaking about it spiritually right
[1:11:00] I don't you know you get what I mean
[1:11:02] but it's a spiritual you're just letting
[1:11:05] the real you loose
[1:11:08] and that's the one that's connected with
[1:11:10] God do you know what happens it's like
[1:11:13] this whole snowball of glory that
[1:11:15] happens a snowball of glory oh man you
[1:11:18] can keep that one okay it's a snowball
[1:11:21] of glory because once it precipitates
[1:11:24] well that's a scientific way but once it
[1:11:26] starts or something ignites it it
[1:11:29] Kindles once it Kindles open you know
[1:11:33] and you and and you enter into something
[1:11:35] like it could be just a scripture and it
[1:11:38] just questions you and you think all of
[1:11:40] a sudden your perception of that
[1:11:42] scripture changes your perception of
[1:11:44] that promise changes that magnifies it
[1:11:46] it's greater it becomes more poignant it
[1:11:49] becomes more impressive to you and there
[1:11:53] and are we in it and it makes us more
[1:11:55] sufficiently impressed by the message of
[1:11:58] the gospel the message of Jesus Christ
[1:12:01] that we have in our midst it impresses
[1:12:03] then upon us and we see it and we
[1:12:06] perceive it more than how show me I
[1:12:08] perceive the art coming into Jerusalem
[1:12:10] more than how Joab saw the art coming
[1:12:13] into Jerusalem and there I say it more
[1:12:16] than how David saw the art coming to
[1:12:19] Jerusalem he would he was a prophet and
[1:12:21] he would have caught inspiration but we
[1:12:23] are in a higher age then David was a and
[1:12:27] we are now to perceive how that
[1:12:30] personally affects us and our life what
[1:12:34] does it mean to you the ark coming to
[1:12:37] Jerusalem five years ago I think it was
[1:12:40] we were in here and I was rejoicing
[1:12:42] because the thought of the ark coming to
[1:12:45] Wellington and raising up a church just
[1:12:47] made me so happy I was so happy and I'm
[1:12:50] still happy they've been real happy and
[1:12:52] it makes me wanna dance around this
[1:12:54] pulpit oh yeah because it's such a great
[1:12:58] thing that God would visit a land that's
[1:13:01] cursed and he would heal the land
[1:13:03] because there isn't nothing can hold God
[1:13:06] back when he wants to do something when
[1:13:08] he set his eyes upon a people when he
[1:13:10] has an Alexei din a place he's going to
[1:13:13] bless that land and he's gonna raise up
[1:13:15] a people the ark came to Wellington it's
[1:13:18] how I was dancing around you I came here
[1:13:19] really having a good
[1:13:21] time around that uh and I'm still having
[1:13:23] a good time but in the Lord opened this
[1:13:25] to me I'll share you a testimony but I'm
[1:13:28] not going to go into the details of the
[1:13:30] testimony but when I was in Vietnam I
[1:13:32] was I was actually researching worship
[1:13:36] in my room and I was having a good time
[1:13:39] and in the in while I was reading some
[1:13:43] quotes I I noticed that this it was the
[1:13:50] Prophet was speaking about a subject
[1:13:53] that went from the worship to what you
[1:13:58] know how with in revelation chapter five
[1:14:00] the lamb steps forth and takes the book
[1:14:03] and how from that one scripture now I
[1:14:08] was under inspiration at this time in it
[1:14:10] so you know when you're under
[1:14:10] inspiration in it especially as a
[1:14:12] minister you start seeing heaps of
[1:14:14] things and it all starts tying together
[1:14:16] and it's really amazing but I saw this
[1:14:19] version hustle you know and then the
[1:14:22] thought and I was like and as I was
[1:14:24] pondering over how that's caused
[1:14:26] different schools of thought right on
[1:14:29] how where the coming of the Lord and put
[1:14:31] in the context of what the coming of the
[1:14:34] Lord is and how he comes because you see
[1:14:36] if yes the Lord is coming
[1:14:40] everyone knows the Lord's coming and we
[1:14:42] know and and in some respects you know
[1:14:45] he's here so now this it's a fine line
[1:14:50] to differentiate between where he's here
[1:14:53] and he's coming and then I was thinking
[1:14:56] about now yes he's keys here spiritually
[1:14:59] and the fullness his Holy Ghost is here
[1:15:02] and His Holy Ghost as his Holy Ghost is
[1:15:05] here just like his Holy Ghost was in all
[1:15:07] the ages that he came and spoke but his
[1:15:11] Holy Ghost was just giving more now
[1:15:12] right his Holy Ghost has got all the
[1:15:15] inheritance now he just limited what
[1:15:17] they had in their different ages he
[1:15:18] limited what they had in the different
[1:15:20] times because they were coming through a
[1:15:22] process of restoration
[1:15:23] so he limited it but it was still him he
[1:15:26] just didn't help give everything he
[1:15:27] didn't open all of his book and give her
[1:15:29] the whole thing because they weren't
[1:15:30] ready for the rapture there he needed us
[1:15:32] to come if he gave him that we wouldn't
[1:15:34] even be here
[1:15:35] it would be a rapture only happen so
[1:15:37] can't give it all so he holds it back so
[1:15:39] he holds some back but he gives just
[1:15:41] enough for their age according to their
[1:15:43] revelation according to what he has
[1:15:45] purpose for them and then you have so
[1:15:48] there so yes the Lord come in the
[1:15:50] fullness of his presence right the
[1:15:53] faultless Holy Ghost come and opened the
[1:15:55] whole book and the Lord would and well
[1:15:57] the people and lead the people in the
[1:15:59] fullness of his prison so the church
[1:16:02] would come right up into his image and
[1:16:04] it would be she would be a perfect
[1:16:07] reflection of him right
[1:16:09] so that's think that's a that's the
[1:16:11] spiritual coming of the Lord the Holy
[1:16:13] Spirit and the fullness of his presence
[1:16:15] but then there's a corporal coming of
[1:16:17] the Lord you know then there is the the
[1:16:19] physical body that's up in there and I'm
[1:16:22] thinking about this right I'm going wow
[1:16:25] that's quite cool in it but and I've
[1:16:27] many times cuz I feel for I see this
[1:16:30] sign and I'm seeing the Sun I'm seeing
[1:16:32] how they kind of antagonistic
[1:16:34] and I'm praying Lord what you know and
[1:16:38] he knows very well that I've many times
[1:16:40] tried to start writing things out to
[1:16:42] balance it but it just goes like this as
[1:16:45] I spoke to change it just goes massive
[1:16:47] so wide that you can't come you cannot
[1:16:50] it's too much too much maybe some people
[1:16:53] can but not it's too much for me anyway
[1:16:55] and it just goes you know like your
[1:16:57] strings you get strings of thoughts and
[1:16:59] it just the strings just go a meter wide
[1:17:01] you know and you just can't convince
[1:17:03] I'll it because it's too much just at
[1:17:05] one scripture you know just one little
[1:17:07] verse that's like ten words goes too
[1:17:09] much for my brain and too much earlier
[1:17:12] and I see it but I can't describe it I
[1:17:14] see it and I see how it all comes
[1:17:16] together but you try and describe the
[1:17:18] head it's just too much you can't you'll
[1:17:20] miss something out you'll unbalance
[1:17:22] something and then the Lord said to me
[1:17:24] in some way it was inaudible but he said
[1:17:26] to me go back and have a look at how the
[1:17:28] ark comes to into Jerusalem before
[1:17:32] Solomon is a there's a season where the
[1:17:35] ark is in Jerusalem and a tent
[1:17:38] I'll leave that there I hope if we run
[1:17:42] can catch that maybe you can't isn't the
[1:17:46] ark comes into Jerusalem in a tent
[1:17:48] moving it can move around it's not an
[1:17:51] it's fixed corporal body yet that
[1:17:53] Solomon would build but just under that
[1:17:55] Ministry of David the app would come
[1:17:57] into Jerusalem in a tent and and when I
[1:18:01] saw that the Lord just blew it open and
[1:18:05] it just balanced the whole thing and
[1:18:09] that's why I get so excited about this
[1:18:12] because that is if you see that and you
[1:18:16] pray about it I'm not gonna go that I'm
[1:18:18] not gonna go deep that was just the
[1:18:19] testimony the Lord gave me this amazing
[1:18:22] experience how it would balance such a
[1:18:25] complex thought such a complex thing to
[1:18:30] balance because of the different and
[1:18:32] it's not really complex it's simple
[1:18:34] really when you see it like that you see
[1:18:36] I was actually very simple but man try
[1:18:39] to over explain these things that's why
[1:18:41] when a prophet preach the Seventh Seal
[1:18:43] he says stop don't try and explain it
[1:18:45] and become so spiritual and
[1:18:47] understandable it's not a doctrine to
[1:18:51] person it's a coming of the Lord and how
[1:18:54] he comes because it's so important that
[1:18:57] we realize how he comes but not just
[1:18:59] realize like I understand it but you
[1:19:01] need a heaven it needs to be real in you
[1:19:04] hello lawyer so what do you see when you
[1:19:08] see the ark coming to Jerusalem what
[1:19:10] does that type show you I know what it
[1:19:13] shows me it shows me that my King has
[1:19:17] come down in his spiritual form and he's
[1:19:19] come inside me inside this tent inside
[1:19:22] this Jerusalem the act came here so it
[1:19:25] went from just the ark coming -
[1:19:27] Ellington and me rejoicing and I
[1:19:29] realized that the ark is coming here and
[1:19:32] he's beating at the gate hallelujah and
[1:19:35] he's removing all of the things that
[1:19:37] would hinder that that's why you go for
[1:19:38] a trial that's why he's rubbing you the
[1:19:41] wrong way sometime that's why you get
[1:19:43] pruned down to a stump every now and
[1:19:44] again MA
[1:19:47] that's why
[1:19:48] because he's trying to bring up pure yes
[1:19:54] we sound purify my heart because he
[1:19:57] wants to come and live in there and his
[1:19:59] fullness of his presence but until it
[1:20:02] but around there you know this before
[1:20:05] David got in there to Jerusalem remember
[1:20:08] what was surrounding the hut
[1:20:10] it was complexes it was invalids there
[1:20:14] was false images of humanity they were
[1:20:18] surrounding it but and they what were
[1:20:20] they doing
[1:20:20] does he not remember what those those
[1:20:24] lame halt and blind people were sent
[1:20:26] there for around the walls of Jerusalem
[1:20:30] they were sent here to mock David so
[1:20:34] here's the King it's meant to be in
[1:20:36] there it's be in the heart of Jerusalem
[1:20:38] he's meant to be dinging pitch it in
[1:20:43] there in the heart of Jerusalem the land
[1:20:46] was to come to its adoption you know
[1:20:49] they've been so long since Joshua or
[1:20:52] five hundred years and then finally now
[1:20:54] they're finally getting their heads
[1:20:55] together like and that means getting rid
[1:20:57] of the heads because they're thinking
[1:21:00] too much and they're trying to roll each
[1:21:01] other or I know this and that and
[1:21:03] overthink it you know I never figure it
[1:21:06] out and trying to preach it and make it
[1:21:09] all happen but if they just died to
[1:21:13] themselves you know
[1:21:15] and and God could have just you know God
[1:21:18] raised up the king and he's so he's
[1:21:20] beating it because that land the this
[1:21:23] role needed to come to Jerusalem that's
[1:21:26] where God wants to be that's where the
[1:21:28] art needs to be it stayed in Shiloh for
[1:21:32] so long
[1:21:33] students at Shiloh is tranquil silence
[1:21:36] the hick here's the the fullness of the
[1:21:38] word the spoken word that you would
[1:21:40] speak in at all heaven and it's sitting
[1:21:42] in your Shiloh silent sitting in your
[1:21:45] Shiloh
[1:21:46] I'm usable yet but it's there because
[1:21:48] you came in the land they are led you
[1:21:51] into the land
[1:21:52] the axe stays in your shiloh stays in
[1:21:54] silence because you know but you receive
[1:21:57] the Lord the spirit of adoption crossed
[1:22:00] over the captain comes down into your
[1:22:02] life doesn't he the Holy Ghost comes
[1:22:04] down lead you comes down to bring you to
[1:22:07] adoption until finally he's at the gate
[1:22:09] of Jerusalem and he's the one that went
[1:22:12] up up the gutters he's the one that went
[1:22:14] up through the gutters that has mony and
[1:22:16] tunnels to defeat those complexes out in
[1:22:18] your life so that David could enter in
[1:22:20] he's the one the kept and the Holy Ghost
[1:22:23] the spirit of adoption he's the one that
[1:22:25] comes up into your spirit comes into
[1:22:27] your conscience comes into your
[1:22:28] reasoning comes into your affections
[1:22:30] comes into your imaginations he's the
[1:22:32] one that pushes those things back he's
[1:22:34] the one that comes up through the
[1:22:36] gutters of your life to defeat those
[1:22:39] complexes and all those things that's
[1:22:41] why you're going through these things
[1:22:42] right now that's why it's all happening
[1:22:44] that's why you're being tried through
[1:22:46] the refiners fire the full of soap is
[1:22:49] washing over you that's why you're
[1:22:52] suffering you must suffer suffering is
[1:22:56] just as important as victory actually
[1:23:00] you don't get victory without suffering
[1:23:01] and you can't learn obedience and miss
[1:23:03] you suffer even Jesus God and flesh
[1:23:06] suffer and learn can you how do you
[1:23:11] reconcile I still fully don't actually
[1:23:13] understand that but I see but the
[1:23:15] scripture says it so I'm gonna say it
[1:23:16] anyway he learned obedience through the
[1:23:20] things which he suffered and that's why
[1:23:22] you suffer as you're on a journey you've
[1:23:26] come through those of you if you haven't
[1:23:28] come into the land if there's someone in
[1:23:30] here that has not got the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:32] you are holding on to what something of
[1:23:34] your own you're holding on to your will
[1:23:36] you want to do this you want to do there
[1:23:39] you want to be this you want to be that
[1:23:41] let go and the one that made you the one
[1:23:46] that created joy the one that created
[1:23:49] satisfaction he he will come into you oh
[1:23:54] my oh then what what happens then you
[1:23:59] come into the land that's the beginning
[1:24:01] of your journey the filling of the Holy
[1:24:03] Ghost
[1:24:04] my you know those for us because I have
[1:24:07] to it now minister to those that have
[1:24:11] got the Holy Ghost who come now show you
[1:24:15] how the captain come down into your life
[1:24:18] when you got the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost
[1:24:19] was the captain right before I
[1:24:21] understand the Holy Ghost is the captain
[1:24:23] and he's ready to give you your
[1:24:26] inheritance little by little he said not
[1:24:30] everything at once even though it's in
[1:24:32] you it's that the access to it the faith
[1:24:37] to believe it the things that hold back
[1:24:40] faith to believe as or as also in you
[1:24:43] everything that Israel had and their
[1:24:47] experience in the promised land and all
[1:24:50] of their journey happens inside you
[1:24:53] this is your because jesus said the
[1:24:56] kingdom of God is not thus Jerusalem out
[1:24:59] here he said to the Pharisees it's not
[1:25:01] what you see with your eyes but it's
[1:25:03] actually within you and the king
[1:25:07] the headship when he comes into your
[1:25:10] life hallelujah he's the one that knocks
[1:25:14] on the gates of your Jerusalem he's the
[1:25:17] one the headship he's looking this
[1:25:20] desire his desire for you is that you
[1:25:23] would have access full and free blank
[1:25:27] chicks written signed in the blood of
[1:25:29] Jesus are you to write full and free
[1:25:33] access to everything that Adam lost
[1:25:35] everything that Jesus displayed
[1:25:37] everything that he displayed when he was
[1:25:39] here in the flesh he wants to give you
[1:25:42] full and free access so when the King
[1:25:43] starts to deal in your life when David
[1:25:46] starts to deal in your life he has one
[1:25:48] thing in my true Salaam ah-ha-ha that's
[1:25:54] what he's looking for
[1:25:55] but around that heart as I seen as these
[1:25:58] images at YouTube one time one image
[1:26:05] going into here can cause months years
[1:26:08] half a life of trouble for you that's
[1:26:13] why I'm big on that and it's not just
[1:26:15] you two but it's it's me tube to hey man
[1:26:20] you know the things that we see in the
[1:26:22] flesh something that someone did to us
[1:26:24] maybe our parents failed when we were
[1:26:27] young and they did something wrong and
[1:26:29] it really impacted us and it formed one
[1:26:32] of those false images around our heart
[1:26:35] and it just sat there for many years
[1:26:37] after you got the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:26:40] on cloud nine it was all good and
[1:26:41] everything was fine everything was
[1:26:43] amazing and everybody was loved there
[1:26:45] was no troubles no schism ZnO nothing
[1:26:47] you were just in your cloud nine of the
[1:26:48] Lord you didn't know those things with
[1:26:51] you you didn't know that the suffering
[1:26:53] that you would go through you didn't
[1:26:55] know that the refiner fire would come
[1:26:57] down through your life and the king
[1:26:58] would come and he would start but he
[1:27:01] will start a siege it lay siege to your
[1:27:04] Jerusalem now right now for those of you
[1:27:08] that have got the Holy Ghost and for
[1:27:09] those of you that will get the Holy
[1:27:11] Ghost there's a siege waiting or there's
[1:27:13] a siege in place any CGT who knows what
[1:27:17] a siege is amen a siege a siege for
[1:27:21] though
[1:27:21] you don't know what a seizures are
[1:27:23] seizures when the enemy comes and they
[1:27:25] set up camp riot around you're right
[1:27:27] around a city and they stay there until
[1:27:30] that city gives up surrenders or or or
[1:27:34] or dies of starvation well they eat
[1:27:37] themselves I mean it's just really
[1:27:38] that's not a pretty sight this is the
[1:27:42] case like oh my I think you said too
[1:27:43] much I think I said too much you know
[1:27:48] something's just come out and then you
[1:27:49] realize I shouldn't but there's a siege
[1:27:54] going on but it's a good seat this with
[1:27:58] our heart is under siege by the King of
[1:28:01] glory by the captain of the host -
[1:28:03] hallelujah who's coming up and he's
[1:28:06] dealing in your spiritual realm he's
[1:28:08] dealing because he wants the up he wants
[1:28:12] the fullness of the word to come out of
[1:28:14] your Shiloh out of the wrist out of
[1:28:16] silence Alleluia
[1:28:18] the Lord help me out of silence so that
[1:28:23] it can come up here to speak you know my
[1:28:25] all things are possible
[1:28:27] hallelujah hallelujah that's the context
[1:28:35] it's like 14
[1:28:45] yeah so after you know this is David now
[1:28:48] he's he's he's awesome his perception
[1:28:53] was powerful enough the thought that he
[1:28:57] perceived you see that the app came to
[1:29:00] Jerusalem right the ark came to
[1:29:03] Jerusalem and there's all these
[1:29:04] onlookers and their perceptions are all
[1:29:06] at different places right when the word
[1:29:09] comes forth here and the Ark is like
[1:29:12] coming down to you Jerusalem there's all
[1:29:14] different perceptions theme some
[1:29:16] perceptions as where David's or some
[1:29:19] perceptions may be where you know I
[1:29:21] don't know
[1:29:22] Joab some perceptions may be wherever
[1:29:24] they are you know what you're perceiving
[1:29:27] you know what that thought is doing to
[1:29:30] you it's quite important because that
[1:29:34] thought the thought of God the thought
[1:29:36] of God right when it's spoken as God's
[1:29:38] Word right inside that word he said my
[1:29:41] words are spirit and they are life so
[1:29:44] there is life inside the word which is
[1:29:47] God's life God's life is in the word
[1:29:50] that life has got power that life that's
[1:29:55] why I was so rejoice when we was singing
[1:29:56] there is power power wonder-working
[1:29:57] power because you know that's that power
[1:30:00] was inside the thought and by God's
[1:30:04] grace ask
[1:30:06] someone see look the other day a
[1:30:08] revelation but maybe it was me I
[1:30:09] might've been talking to somebody about
[1:30:10] revelation ask for it or was itwas than
[1:30:13] Emily alter revelation you cannot only
[1:30:19] by revelation that's why we're told ask
[1:30:23] for revelation amen don't try and figure

[1:31:04] that right does it do I have you the
[1:31:06] young people or they want to go and draw
[1:31:08] or play princesses right that's what
[1:31:11] they want to do they don't want to be

[1:31:14] learn English and trying to learn all
[1:31:16] these things and doing all these lines
[1:31:17] getting to teaching for getting in
[1:31:19] trouble they don't want to do that but
[1:31:23] they have to and they've got to use
[1:31:24] their mind and their intellect to try

[1:32:13] this thing is is this doing something
[1:32:15] naughty yeah it working

[1:32:41] we're in an event and this event is
[1:32:44] there's an event taking place than here
[1:32:46] not because I'm here because we're here
[1:32:47] but because he's here and he's doing
[1:32:49] something he wants to take his bride and
[1:32:52] he wants to take her from here and do
[1:32:54] something for her for you
[1:32:56] he's coming down into your home into
[1:32:59] your heart and he's siege in your
[1:33:00] Jerusalem see Jing on a good a very good
[1:33:05] seat I like that seat and it puts
[1:33:07] pressure and that pressure reveals
[1:33:09] something that was mocking David now
[1:33:11] this is where pictures you know because
[1:33:13] these things that are surrounding
[1:33:15] Jerusalem were mocking David and you we
[1:33:18] all know that there's things in our life
[1:33:20] that just they just they just stick and
[1:33:23] every now and again it comes out and you
[1:33:25] think man that just hit the Lord you
[1:33:27] know it hurt the lawn and that's what
[1:33:29] those things are but just remember this
[1:33:32] a captain as Lang see the king is intent
[1:33:37] on getting the app from your Shiloh and
[1:33:39] bringing it from your Shiloh and
[1:33:42] bringing it to your Jerusalem so that
[1:33:45] you have fallen free access but if you
[1:33:47] don't understand that and this is just
[1:33:49] going over your head
[1:33:51] a revelation is it anybody that doesn't
[1:33:55] understand is it clear
[1:33:57] real clear amen David says this is after
[1:34:03] now he's been accused he says tomorrow
[1:34:06] all do better than that
[1:34:09] hallelujah a man that's what you need to
[1:34:11] do when you get all down you know and
[1:34:14] I'll just say this so after you know
[1:34:16] when the youth camp right and the youth
[1:34:18] man I wasn't the I wish I was it was it
[1:34:21] sounds so cool but they were jumping and
[1:34:23] dancing and singing him they were free
[1:34:25] and now my goodness they would have been
[1:34:28] battling McCall like you wouldn't
[1:34:29] believe I'm sure cuz they'd never done
[1:34:31] these things before most of them but
[1:34:35] they had to break
[1:34:36] that field of resistance they had to
[1:34:39] break those things to be free to
[1:34:42] shamelessly uncover themselves to
[1:34:45] uncover what they really are and what
[1:34:48] they really feel shamelessly not shame
[1:34:53] because the glory is snowballing and as
[1:34:57] the glory snowballs the perception of
[1:35:01] what you're going through becomes so
[1:35:02] great you can't contain yourself and all
[1:35:06] that you thought you were and you
[1:35:08] thought you would never do your doing or
[1:35:10] not doing your going amen this these
[1:35:16] things now but what happens is now after
[1:35:19] the Kemp she's waiting McCall is waiting
[1:35:23] she's gonna get you while you're having
[1:35:25] a bad day she's gonna get you while
[1:35:27] you're down on Monday morning terrible
[1:35:29] Tuesday wicked Wednesday by wicked
[1:35:33] Wednesday you need the prayer matey but
[1:35:34] right there they eat right at the
[1:35:36] darkest hour if you don't keep your eyes
[1:35:38] on Jesus amen hallelujah she starts to
[1:35:42] talk to you you know you've got a self
[1:35:51] style you've got to conduct yourself in
[1:35:54] a certain way because your peers will
[1:35:56] think you're like this think you're
[1:35:58] trying to be spiritual that's not what
[1:36:01] it is you just have to take the devil
[1:36:06] right back to that event where you were
[1:36:09] free and you have to say you think
[1:36:11] that's bad you wait til Wednesday night
[1:36:13] amen
[1:36:14] you wait til Sunday morning hallelujah
[1:36:18] I'm gonna just do whatever it takes to
[1:36:20] express my eternal self not by just
[1:36:23] doing it because it's not that when you
[1:36:27] are in that envelope of glory
[1:36:30] we'll use that word when you're in that
[1:36:33] place your perception changes and all of
[1:36:37] a sudden that makes it even greater and
[1:36:38] you just keep even worse
[1:36:40] amen hallelujah amen
[1:36:43] now I'm not advocating that everyone
[1:36:46] needs to be jumping and cartwheeling
[1:36:47] right but if you feel like you need to
[1:36:50] do
[1:36:50] but the just the fact that just needs to
[1:36:53] happen it's starting here there's no
[1:36:57] point in you're doing it all out here
[1:36:58] and it's not in here right otherwise
[1:37:00] it's just it's just a put-on
[1:37:02] it's an emotional lifting up but I'm not
[1:37:06] talking about an emotional lifting up
[1:37:07] this morning I'm speaking about our Holy
[1:37:09] Ghost lifting up by the word by your
[1:37:14] perception of the word because it's a
[1:37:17] thought inside that thought is God's
[1:37:19] life and when it's spoken and you see
[1:37:22] what is being spoken before of it has
[1:37:25] got power to take you out of that seat
[1:37:28] but power to take you out of yourself
[1:37:32] but it's what you see when it's being
[1:37:35] preached I can't really is so hard to
[1:37:40] describe this the goo snowball glory
[1:37:41] I'll let a man do that
[1:37:44] snowball glory bro hallelujah you know a
[1:37:47] snowball when I say snowball we're
[1:37:49] talking about
[1:37:49] when a snowball starts rolling it gets
[1:37:51] bigger and bigger right when you start
[1:37:53] praising and when you start worshiping
[1:37:55] when you start giving him glory when
[1:37:56] suddenly happens it just gets bigger and
[1:37:58] bigger and bigger and it doesn't go away
[1:38:02] the thought is eternal and it goes past
[1:38:06] your memory you don't forget it stays in
[1:38:09] here then when someone touches that spot
[1:38:11] again look out people look out McCall
[1:38:14] she's going down amen you know McCall
[1:38:17] became fruitless because of that nature
[1:38:20] that were you allowed again I'm the same
[1:38:23] we allow to govern us or mockolate Lord
[1:38:26] that nature is fruitless can't be
[1:38:29] fruitful when that nature when she's
[1:38:31] when you listen to her don't listen to
[1:38:33] her when she starts going at you you not
[1:38:35] you need to say tomorrow I'll do better
[1:38:38] than that
[1:38:39] hey man yes sir he said don't you know I
[1:38:41] was dancing unto the Lord and he says he
[1:38:44] crossed over oh my won't he cross over
[1:38:48] he crossed over something a man he
[1:38:51] deported himself into another dimension
[1:38:53] by praise why because when you praise
[1:38:55] with real praise the Lord inhabits the
[1:38:58] praises of his
[1:39:00] real praise amen
[1:39:05] he was in the land of the promise and he
[1:39:08] lost all self styles and muck of the
[1:39:10] world he was so happy to know the ark
[1:39:13] was coming into his own City I've got
[1:39:17] another quote down here so you don't
[1:39:19] want to read that now it says here you
[1:39:22] know god looked down out of heaven and
[1:39:24] he said David you're a man after my own
[1:39:28] heart
[1:39:30] this is this is what really touches the
[1:39:33] heart of God is when someone is willing
[1:39:35] to just worship lose self style cross
[1:39:42] over hallelujah
[1:39:44] deport yourself a man one day we really
[1:39:48] got a deport a man but why not have a
[1:39:51] temporary deportation Amen hallelujah
[1:39:54] this world is stale and wicked enough
[1:39:57] you know massive leave the world leave
[1:40:00] it hallelujah Amen my David you're a man
[1:40:08] after my own heart
[1:40:09] see he had done lost all pride he had
[1:40:12] done lost all of hers yes he was married
[1:40:16] yet he was married to a king's daughter
[1:40:19] but that wasn't even considered is that
[1:40:25] saw coming back again complex limitation
[1:40:31] there was a gift inside David David had
[1:40:35] a gift inside him
[1:40:37] now catch this this is quite a big
[1:40:40] Thorpe it inside David as the whole
[1:40:43] anointing and the gift and the calling
[1:40:45] to to take everything that was promised
[1:40:48] by Joshua and make it a reality and even
[1:40:52] before he was crowned the King had
[1:40:55] already started to happen that's why
[1:40:57] things are happening here because
[1:40:59] David's coming into Jerusalem of your
[1:41:02] life that's why you're seeing but there
[1:41:04] is already happening you're seeing the
[1:41:05] inheritance that was promised by our
[1:41:07] prophet our Joshua all that stuff you
[1:41:12] know twenty years ago it would seem a
[1:41:14] possible to see it in reality now you
[1:41:16] see we're seeing it we're seeing the
[1:41:19] dawning and the inheritance coming
[1:41:22] because of the atmosphere because David
[1:41:25] is welcome because we were sick and
[1:41:27] tired of the time of Judges a man was
[1:41:30] sick and tired of the politics and sick
[1:41:32] and tired of all that he says she says
[1:41:34] politics and grudges and unforgiveness
[1:41:35] and all that stuff and all the
[1:41:37] ministerial Fighting's circulat because
[1:41:41] david can't be king under their
[1:41:43] hemisphere the only way David can be
[1:41:45] king as winning all the differences are
[1:41:47] humbled and people died to themself
[1:41:49] because he's the head Jesus is the head
[1:41:52] when Jesus is the hid not by what we say
[1:41:55] we preached it for forty years but now
[1:41:58] when it becomes your life saying it not
[1:42:02] you anointing David King with this but
[1:42:05] was this it was this your whole life
[1:42:08] anointing him King this makes a
[1:42:11] difference because in them inside him is
[1:42:13] the very calling the very anointing the
[1:42:16] very ability that's Jesus I'm talking
[1:42:20] about to inherit all the message to
[1:42:23] inherit everything to to make it a
[1:42:26] reality to take now the arc from your
[1:42:31] shiloh from a place of silence in your
[1:42:33] life and put it into your Jerusalem I'll
[1:42:36] repeat myself again that's why you're
[1:42:38] going through all these trials that's
[1:42:40] why when you fail and you say something
[1:42:42] to someone or you get into a altercation
[1:42:45] all these things happen and you realize
[1:42:47] it was wrong and all the pride and all
[1:42:50] the defenses and all of those
[1:42:51] insecurities and all those things come
[1:42:53] up because the captain is knocking he's
[1:42:56] seeing your Jerusalem because he has one
[1:43:00] intent he wants the fullness of the word
[1:43:03] he wants the arc inside the heart and
[1:43:08] that's really in the Hat but in the
[1:43:10] Jerusalem of that you know there's a
[1:43:12] heart hidden there's a heart inside the
[1:43:14] heart you know there are doors in a door
[1:43:16] amen
[1:43:17] there's a lot of doors in a heart Amen
[1:43:19] just open them all hallelujah open them
[1:43:23] all and let the King comin
[1:43:25] ah it'll help me Jesus oh my I mean I'm
[1:43:31] preaching to me too this is all of us
[1:43:33] but together we have to use wisdom amen
[1:43:37] we have to you know carry ourselves with
[1:43:41] an excellent spirit which is God's
[1:43:43] Spirit in the middle of Babylon all
[1:43:47] lowliness and meekness and
[1:43:49] loving-kindness but then our faults rub
[1:43:54] up against other people's faults and
[1:43:55] their faults rubbin all those things
[1:43:57] bring things out now you don't go in
[1:44:01] react to the person and go and try and
[1:44:05] sort something out and try to figure out
[1:44:06] what the Lord is working on you it's
[1:44:10] look at yourself and say God change me
[1:44:15] Lord Jesus I know your seed you'd my
[1:44:19] Jerusalem I know that you were getting
[1:44:21] rid of those images that have mocked you
[1:44:23] all my life
[1:44:24] and it's time hallelujah but the reasons
[1:44:27] happening is because we're in the season
[1:44:28] where adoption is coming we were coming
[1:44:31] into the adoption but before you can
[1:44:34] handle the fullness of God's word
[1:44:37] operating in your voice like it was in
[1:44:40] the time of Adam before the fall like it
[1:44:43] was when the second Adam was walking the
[1:44:45] earth like it was when brother Branham
[1:44:47] came to his adoption when he spoke it to
[1:44:50] you it must be a maturity because you
[1:44:59] can you imagine I mean even you see
[1:45:01] Elijah the Prophet and a shadow of what
[1:45:04] we receive he was a prophet of course as
[1:45:08] calling was a prophet right you don't
[1:45:10] I'm not talking about the office I'm
[1:45:12] talking about the the creative power and
[1:45:16] a man's mouth so God would as a prophet
[1:45:18] he spoke cursed over those children and
[1:45:21] it was not wrong until they were killed
[1:45:23] by a beer because there was not the
[1:45:27] character or the temperance because
[1:45:29] there was a mocking thing in his heart
[1:45:31] that winner mocked it did something and
[1:45:34] it caused all that destruction on those
[1:45:36] children now
[1:45:38] now for us to have the fullness of that
[1:45:42] where you speak in it happens that's why
[1:45:46] those mockers around the Jerusalem must
[1:45:49] be delivered by the captain and he's
[1:45:53] there he's here I know because I'm going
[1:45:55] through it all my is not easy but that's
[1:45:58] essential hallelujah we're clay he's the
[1:46:02] Potter and he's molding and he's shaping
[1:46:04] oh my
[1:46:06] Alleluia as he knowed that he was
[1:46:11] acquainted with possessor of heavens and
[1:46:14] earth and here was the Word of God
[1:46:16] coming right back among them again
[1:46:18] Alleluia and David was so happy he
[1:46:20] danced he danced as hard as he could
[1:46:24] Miriam she grabbed the tambourine and
[1:46:26] went down the bank dancing on the other
[1:46:28] side after she had come through the Red
[1:46:30] Sea and seen her enemies drowned and
[1:46:33] then she could dance in the spirit when
[1:46:36] she seen she seen the enemies they had
[1:46:40] tormented her can you imagine that those
[1:46:43] people that had worked her all her life
[1:46:45] and hurt her children probably killed
[1:46:47] some babies I don't know but enemy Wow
[1:46:53] you know one day you're gonna watch all
[1:46:54] those demons burn all the ones that have
[1:46:57] troubled you took it taken family
[1:46:59] members done all those things you know
[1:47:01] watch them but she she really she's seen
[1:47:08] yo she got caught up in the fault of you
[1:47:13] know when that happened when you can get
[1:47:16] caught up in the fall
[1:47:17] cuz there is an event that took place
[1:47:19] and it was an expression of God songs
[1:47:21] when you get caught up in it oh and
[1:47:24] there's no McCall to restrict you you
[1:47:26] were there you were there with them when
[1:47:30] they dancing the tempering you were
[1:47:32] there with them when they shouted in the
[1:47:34] walls of Jericho felt and you were there
[1:47:36] when Rahab came out hallelujah because
[1:47:39] of the anointing because of the Spirit
[1:47:41] of God in you and the thought when it's
[1:47:44] revealed to you it becomes personal to
[1:47:46] you and you see yourself in the
[1:47:47] scriptures you were there now this is
[1:47:50] where this is the essence of
[1:47:52] what I'm trying to say it's the thought
[1:47:54] of God the thought it's powerful and
[1:47:58] when you get caught up in that fall can
[1:48:02] change your life and your reaction
[1:48:05] becomes appropriate to the word to
[1:48:08] what's being expressed because it's that
[1:48:10] there is a reality there is a it's a
[1:48:12] two-way relationship it's not a one-way
[1:48:15] relationship where the preacher just
[1:48:16] preaches out and you sit there alone
[1:48:18] it's not passive this is not a passive
[1:48:22] situation that we're in no we are all up
[1:48:27] and caught up in an event right now
[1:48:29] we're caught up and it's not me it's not
[1:48:31] you it's well it has us but yet God he's
[1:48:35] like glowing the situation together cuz
[1:48:38] his thoughts are coming forth and he's
[1:48:40] looking for seeking such that would
[1:48:43] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:48:46] he's seeking people then it gets excited
[1:48:49] about the art coming into their life
[1:48:51] hallelujah she's seen the enemies that
[1:48:56] had told me to do did and she doesn't
[1:48:58] that's right now see after after the
[1:49:02] barrels one then the glory of the Lord
[1:49:04] comes down
[1:49:12] okay
[1:49:17] Joe 38-7 says when the morning stars
[1:49:20] sang together and all the sons of God
[1:49:22] shouted for joy that is your eternal
[1:49:28] image because that thought and I said
[1:49:32] that last time but I'll say it again
[1:49:33] that thought was as in God's mind right
[1:49:36] in God's mind you shattered an eternity
[1:49:41] now we don't remember that because we've
[1:49:44] been somehow trapped into this cookie of
[1:49:46] time but in God's line an eternity which
[1:49:50] never began and never will in you your
[1:49:53] release all shouting joy joy sing joy
[1:50:00] and speak singing together that's what
[1:50:07] he saw you saw that now when we go in
[1:50:11] the rapture and we come up into eternity
[1:50:13] when we're back there we will remember
[1:50:15] that because it will help with us we're
[1:50:18] in a store remember has our thoughts we
[1:50:20] think something I mean it's gone
[1:50:22] think that his thoughts are eternal when
[1:50:25] he thought that and saw you that was it
[1:50:28] now you're on a journey back to that now
[1:50:32] your your your Jerusalem's being sieged
[1:50:35] so you can come back to that and we're
[1:50:37] going to leave this earth and come up
[1:50:39] into a glorious body and remember what
[1:50:42] that was is and it wasn't when we get
[1:50:44] there won't be was it'll be is it would
[1:50:47] be shouting amen hallelujah
[1:50:49] it's like a pre vision of what we're
[1:50:51] doing around the throne like now you
[1:50:56] know I mean that sounds really crazy but
[1:50:58] it's kind of happening already yet we're
[1:51:00] experienced somehow our consciousness is
[1:51:03] down here experiencing this to develop
[1:51:05] an appreciation for redemption to
[1:51:07] develop worship to to have a
[1:51:13] relationship where there is a choice
[1:51:16] amen
[1:51:24] someone said brother branham you got
[1:51:27] some of that there new kind of religion
[1:51:28] heaven you I said no I got a good dose
[1:51:31] of the old kind hey man I said I said I
[1:51:34] mean that shout it heat now he's saying
[1:51:36] this to Victor brother Brown I said I
[1:51:38] mean that shouting religion he said
[1:51:40] that's the oldest religion was ever
[1:51:42] known I said God asked job where were
[1:51:45] you when I laid the foundation of the
[1:51:47] world when the morning stars sang
[1:51:48] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:51:50] joy 10,000 years before the world was
[1:51:53] ever formed amen going to call me Holy
[1:51:55] Roller anyhow so you might as well get
[1:51:57] ready get used to it amen was I gonna
[1:52:04] say that yeah
[1:52:17] oops I think I might not say that all
[1:52:23] okay
[1:52:32] in 1956 in German Christ brother branham
[1:52:38] has his own breakthrough over McCall is
[1:52:43] you know I've always a sort of a timid
[1:52:46] sort of person haunted a timid sort of
[1:52:49] person this is a little something about
[1:52:50] myself
[1:52:51] Monday night so we can just let down our
[1:52:54] collars and talk a moment when I first
[1:52:56] seen the Full Gospel people and heard
[1:52:59] them clap their hands and I thought as a
[1:53:01] Baptist now they sure have some church
[1:53:04] members don't or dignities anyhow I
[1:53:06] thought Meyer that's horrible and then
[1:53:12] to beat it all and here got somebody on
[1:53:15] the floor and started dancing up and
[1:53:17] down on the floor oh my I just didn't
[1:53:20] understand some young ladies wanted to
[1:53:24] beat some little tin cans and things and
[1:53:27] they had a washboard and some symbols on
[1:53:29] it or on their fingers how about we go
[1:53:31] back to washboards and thimbles and tin
[1:53:33] cans a man they had a good time
[1:53:37] hallelujah hallelujah and a little
[1:53:40] blonde headed sister about so high
[1:53:42] jumped out in the floor and started
[1:53:45] dancing so I looked around and I thought
[1:53:48] my where did dancing ever come from and
[1:53:51] I was sitting there in the seat of the
[1:53:54] scornful now here is a prophet messenger
[1:53:57] sitting in the seat of the scornful not
[1:54:00] understanding but he's about honesty of
[1:54:04] course you know it's not saying nothing
[1:54:06] I was he wasn't he just said he didn't
[1:54:09] say anything he was just observing this
[1:54:11] girl dancing in his church now on the in
[1:54:15] the front you know you can imagine like
[1:54:18] this is now very different from what
[1:54:19] he's used to
[1:54:20] now McCall is getting stirred up so then
[1:54:25] I begin to rehearse in my mind then in
[1:54:28] the Bible they did dance and I thought
[1:54:30] when they danced what was it dancing was
[1:54:33] spoke off when Pharaoh was pursuing
[1:54:35] Azrael and all the enemy was drowned now
[1:54:38] he's thinking about this he's pondering
[1:54:39] these things in his mind this is what
[1:54:41] happens when you ponder the word when
[1:54:43] you start thinking about God
[1:54:45] and the thought of God the thought is
[1:54:48] coming he's getting caught up in the
[1:54:51] thought this is what we need this is
[1:54:53] what I'm preaching when Maryam picked up
[1:54:58] a tambourine and began to beat the
[1:54:59] tambourine and begin to dance and all
[1:55:01] the daughters of Israel followed her
[1:55:03] dancing I thought well there they had
[1:55:06] victory well I thought the only thing is
[1:55:09] the matter with me
[1:55:10] I just ain't got enough victory maybe in
[1:55:13] a few minutes something happens I like
[1:55:20] it when something happens don't you love
[1:55:23] it when something happens hallelujah
[1:55:26] now this might shock you when when he
[1:55:35] says here when I came back to myself
[1:55:37] so something heaven and he lost
[1:55:39] consciousness hallelujah you know
[1:55:42] sometimes you get in such a position in
[1:55:44] your McCall that you that you can't God
[1:55:48] has to take you out Sovereign Grace
[1:55:50] let's take and take you out of your
[1:55:53] consciousness to bring you up to where
[1:55:55] you need to be and I pray that today if
[1:55:57] there's anybody in here that needs that
[1:56:00] it's something to you may something
[1:56:03] happen to you
[1:56:06] hallelujah when I come to myself now I
[1:56:10] put any linear shamelessly I'm covered
[1:56:13] now cuz he's now he's like whoa what now
[1:56:16] I'm like you know like he's now
[1:56:18] reflecting the oldest religion in the
[1:56:20] book and now reflecting what it was
[1:56:22] before the world ever began what it was
[1:56:25] an eternity what was happening in the
[1:56:28] church service and glory hallelujah he
[1:56:31] now is shamelessly he was reflecting it
[1:56:33] but God took him out of himself to get
[1:56:36] Alleluia I was out there with that
[1:56:40] little girl dancing out on the phone
[1:56:43] hallelujah you have no license to dance
[1:56:47] you are free to dance amen hallelujah
[1:56:51] can you imagine an endtime word prophet
[1:56:55] that was used to open the seven seals
[1:56:57] under the leader
[1:56:59] of the Lamb of God a prophet that the
[1:57:03] dead that was called to do that a new
[1:57:06] night bride and bridegroom as now
[1:57:10] shamelessly uncovered dancing with a
[1:57:14] girl out on the floor of the church
[1:57:17] that's right just the thing that I
[1:57:20] thought I wouldn't do and I'm sure
[1:57:22] there's people thinking that right now I
[1:57:24] wouldn't do that but I can tell you now
[1:57:27] if something happened to you to you to
[1:57:31] you to you to all you you will be doing
[1:57:35] that hallelujah amen just the thing I
[1:57:39] thought that I wouldn't do hey man oh my
[1:57:41] I did and when I well I was never on a
[1:57:49] dance for my life but I guess I did it
[1:57:51] all right ha ha
[1:57:52] amen you know I want to go back to that
[1:57:55] convention again because it was just
[1:57:56] such an empowering but there were people
[1:57:58] dancing on that floor that had never
[1:58:00] danced in their life there was no smooth
[1:58:04] moves going on man it was just all limbs
[1:58:07] men we were moving something happened
[1:58:12] hallelujah something beautiful you know
[1:58:17] you could have got the dance teachers
[1:58:19] from some dance school coming in there
[1:58:20] going oh my goodness what's this but
[1:58:22] that that was beautiful because God was
[1:58:25] seeing liberty God was seeing freedom
[1:58:28] God was seeing people able after years
[1:58:32] of McCole rolling their life to express
[1:58:35] and shamelessly uncover their eternal
[1:58:38] nature that's what you are and I pray
[1:58:41] with all my heart that something would
[1:58:43] happen to cause you to come out of your
[1:58:46] Kip go beyond yourself and be able to
[1:58:50] allow God this is mercy and grace I'm so
[1:58:57] thankful for this quote and where I was
[1:59:00] never on a dance floor in my life but I
[1:59:01] guess I did it alright it what I sure
[1:59:04] felt awful good and here this is what I
[1:59:08] just like this I had a lot of victory
[1:59:11] after that can you
[1:59:13] in the Liberty now this is like this is
[1:59:16] a milestone in the prophets life and
[1:59:18] it's a milestone in our life when
[1:59:20] something happens to take us out of our
[1:59:23] self so that we can worship God the way
[1:59:26] that he wants to be worshipped and when
[1:59:28] the thought comes and we get the
[1:59:30] revelation of the foot the reaction is
[1:59:32] according to the revelation and there's
[1:59:34] a there's a continuity there is a
[1:59:38] synchronization is not really the
[1:59:40] perfect word for it but there is a
[1:59:43] dovetailing between you and him God in
[1:59:47] his bride the marriage union is in love
[1:59:50] it's these feelings heartfelt glory to
[1:59:56] God
[2:00:09] what made David so happy it was the
[2:00:14] significance it's significantly revealed
[2:00:20] he saw the significance of the arc
[2:00:23] coming back and in that the office of
[2:00:28] that gift near his life would have been
[2:00:30] so stirred to see a desire of God
[2:00:35] because God's patient why this way until
[2:00:40] man's ready
[2:00:41] I mean his heart can come to Jerusalem
[2:00:43] he would have wanted a sock in Jerusalem
[2:00:45] straight away take that city but he
[2:00:49] waits it and he watched them fuss for
[2:00:51] four hundred years
[2:00:52] and kill each other and matter and come
[2:00:54] under permissive wills and this and that
[2:00:56] and out of it and revivals death all
[2:00:58] sorts of horror he watched he just
[2:01:03] watched and waited just like he's
[2:01:06] watching and waiting and our lives for
[2:01:09] the Ark he wants it David wanted a David
[2:01:13] got caught up and now you see what's
[2:01:15] happening in your life the spirit of
[2:01:17] adoption the Holy Ghost himself that's

[2:01:43] realized and the worship can open it

[2:07:01] supernatural thoughts we're dealing with
[2:07:04] spirits that hold areas and strongholds
[2:07:08] and they work like that says
[2:07:10] principalities and powers and rulers and
[2:07:12] high places
[2:07:13] there's demon powers ruling politics and
[2:07:15] holding nations down our prayers have
[2:07:19] the power to push them back and see
[2:07:22] God's children come out they do we have
[2:07:27] to take it back start on yourself then
[2:07:31] starter your and that you when your and
[2:07:34] their then start with your home and move
[2:07:37] into the local body it out spread the
[2:07:40] influence of God's glory by prayer by
[2:07:44] holding on a man however you're gifted
[2:07:47] how the Lord's gifted you it's why the
[2:07:50] Bible says make your calling and
[2:07:52] election sure give all diligence oh and
[2:07:55] if he says do that and he will he will
[2:07:59] what's the word he will categorically
[2:08:03] show you what your calling is what
[2:08:06] you're here for
[2:08:07] it might not be all of it but at least
[2:08:09] the next part the next stage of your
[2:08:11] life the next pile your calling whatever
[2:08:14] he's called you to do what he wants you
[2:08:15] to do now evil evil he will he has to
[2:08:21] because he wants you to know he doesn't
[2:08:23] want us going and middling and other
[2:08:25] spheres as much as you know there's no
[2:08:29] harm and trying something and if it
[2:08:30] doesn't work Carey I get back to the
[2:08:32] drawing board you know pray hey that one
[2:08:38] was for free and how we got there but
[2:08:43] it's tinted Roman I'll just read it
[2:08:46] romans 8 verse 12 15 it says therefore
[2:08:49] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[2:08:50] to live after the flesh for if we live
[2:08:52] after the flesh you shall die but if you
[2:08:54] live through the spirit and mortify the
[2:08:56] deeds of the body you shall live for as
[2:08:59] many as are led by the Spirit of God
[2:09:00] they are the sons of God for ye have not
[2:09:03] seek the spirit of bondage again to fear
[2:09:05] but ye have received the spirit of
[2:09:06] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father what
[2:09:11] does he do
[2:09:12] remember I said way back I said the Holy
[2:09:18] Ghost come spirit of adoption and we're
[2:09:23] in the season where we're coming up to
[2:09:24] the full measure of Christ you know it's
[2:09:28] not a limited revelation that he's
[2:09:30] bringing he's bringing everything is no
[2:09:32] restraint to the inheritance that he
[2:09:35] hold now he has come the spirit of
[2:09:39] adoption comes into your life to take
[2:09:41] you right through the land until you get
[2:09:43] to Jerusalem when you get to Jerusalem
[2:09:45] he gets rid of the complexes that
[2:09:47] surround you that's why we're going this
[2:09:48] works so hard then he finally you come
[2:09:50] into Jerusalem conquering the very
[2:09:53] adoption why what happens next
[2:09:56] it was second samuel 5 when they came in
[2:09:59] next the outcome that's what he wants
[2:10:02] that's the desire of God as our adoption
[2:10:06] he wants to see himself in you he wants
[2:10:09] to see the church the bride reflect him
[2:10:12] and accept these bodies but she comes
[2:10:17] right up just before the glorified state
[2:10:20] when the up comes in it's just we're
[2:10:24] right I believe it now that's as an as
[2:10:27] an on an age level dispensational e
[2:10:29] we're right there these people that are
[2:10:31] just come out of it gonna come through
[2:10:33] and it kind of bring the right up to the
[2:10:35] very spot where we're at that's why
[2:10:37] ministry ministers an entrance to pick
[2:10:40] the people but it's been paved there
[2:10:42] we're right there it's there's a siege
[2:10:45] happening it's a CJ a man you gonna let
[2:10:49] him who's who wants to let the Lord and
[2:10:53] open your heart let him deal with those
[2:10:57] complexes when they rise when you fail
[2:10:59] when you see it winners light shines on
[2:11:02] it say Lord your captors here I know
[2:11:04] coming I want to let you deal with those
[2:11:08] things that mock you but I want them to
[2:11:10] mock you anymore and I want them to to
[2:11:13] to just go and push back
[2:11:17] take my Jerusalem I want the siege to
[2:11:20] end in victory for the one that's eating
[2:11:24] not for the Jebusites that are hiding
[2:11:27] aside yeah you know I mean it goes as
[2:11:32] deep as you want it to go but the GPUs
[2:11:34] eiders are threshing that's why the
[2:11:36] angel came to do it on the threshing
[2:11:37] floor
[2:11:37] it's the threshing right pipes the
[2:11:40] devil's got against you the thing that
[2:11:43] restricts you you know when that's
[2:11:44] defeated you're going there's gonna be
[2:11:47] no restriction there's always a right
[2:11:49] purge there's something weakness in your
[2:11:51] life the devil he has this right punch
[2:11:53] really hits you sometimes you know my
[2:11:59] you know that's about to be completely
[2:12:03] removed I really believe that that will
[2:12:06] be removed as David enters as the
[2:12:08] headship the King comes down and the arc
[2:12:10] gets invited they bring me up a man and
[2:12:16] if anyone's thinking of the other things
[2:12:20] that happen between Shiloh and in the
[2:12:22] arc as a completely different subject I
[2:12:23] don't want to over but you know there's
[2:12:26] a lot that happens just before over
[2:12:28] datums house it goes to the Philistines
[2:12:29] and all that but we won't even hurt
[2:12:30] there too much that in itself as a
[2:12:32] series that's so amazing that shows all
[2:12:35] the things that's gone on in the message
[2:12:37] and all the things that's happened over
[2:12:38] the last 50 years it's all there as well
[2:12:40] but we're just dealing from open to here
[2:12:42] well from Shiloh but we're kind of
[2:12:45] missing out a big chunk of things in
[2:12:47] events that took place but the ark came
[2:12:49] from silence in your life silence the
[2:12:54] Seventh Seal silent but then it would
[2:12:57] speak has to speak has to come a time
[2:13:00] where he would speak and it would
[2:13:03] restore everything back and this is just
[2:13:06] me in fellowship but you know when he
[2:13:09] comes in as corporal body who is the
[2:13:11] cloud of witnesses that's awesome

[2:13:42] maybe i don't know it's just my own
[2:13:45] little supernatural fantasy about how
[2:13:49] good it's going to be but you know you
[2:13:51] should ponder on these things it's
[2:13:53] nothing wrong with pondering over how it
[2:13:54] will be how glorious it will be armor

[2:14:35] sitting up I'm just playing that musics
[2:14:37] playing guys want to read this quote
[2:14:45] here it says and this who knows how
[2:14:47] brother Barron talks about that baby
[2:14:48] staring into space you know who you know
[2:14:51] the story about brother Branham talks
[2:14:53] about that woman who has that lady that
[2:14:55] has that baby and she's worried about
[2:14:57] the baby steering into space I just want
[2:15:00] to read this now I'm not I'm not I'm not
[2:15:02] reading this to say that we're in this
[2:15:04] condition but I'm reading this in light
[2:15:06] of being avoiding this condition
[2:15:08] avoiding that place that people can get
[2:15:11] to that we can get to where we get so
[2:15:13] acclimatized to his glory where we get
[2:15:16] so accustomed to what we have that we
[2:15:18] lose the the zeal of his house where
[2:15:23] things become common and our reaction
[2:15:25] becomes like a steering baby
[2:15:29] but we don't want to get like that and
[2:15:30] so I just want to read this just to show
[2:15:32] you what the Prophet says he says in
[2:15:34] Louisville Kentucky a few weeks ago
[2:15:36] there a mother pecking a little baby
[2:15:38] along and she walking along there and
[2:15:41] she was shaking little toys you know
[2:15:43] saying see darling see darling then she
[2:15:46] had get something else see darling see
[2:15:48] darling the little baby just kept
[2:15:50] steering and after a while it kind of
[2:15:54] disturbed the people in the store
[2:15:55] finally she picked up a little bell that
[2:15:57] jingled she said look darling look look
[2:16:00] look
[2:16:01] Mama's darling look and the little baby
[2:16:04] just stared out and she fell across the
[2:16:07] counter and and the little and the
[2:16:10] people come to help her and they said
[2:16:12] what's the matter
[2:16:13] she said oh my little boy here not long
[2:16:16] ago said just started to steering right
[2:16:19] out in space and she said I took him to
[2:16:22] the doctor a while ago and she said he
[2:16:24] was better but he isn't said nothing
[2:16:28] will attract him
[2:16:30] nothing will attract them Syd things
[2:16:33] that bought to attract the little boy
[2:16:35] his age that doesn't attract he just
[2:16:39] sits and stares
[2:16:43] how true that is with the church today
[2:16:45] God shook every kind of a gift he can
[2:16:49] before the church and they still sit and
[2:16:52] stare looking for something else
[2:16:56] remember enjoy now
[2:17:00] don't look look forward fine don't let
[2:17:05] that be and my room for you to miss your
[2:17:07] worship
[2:17:09] don't let the future become at night
[2:17:15] but worship God but who he is
[2:17:21] be thankful for what you have and rest
[2:17:25] and and enjoy the present revelation of
[2:17:29] God
[2:17:31] otherwise you'll miss it and I'm
[2:17:33] preaching to myself my a visionary type
[2:17:36] of person where I keep looking for
[2:17:37] things and building things and making
[2:17:38] China and I and I and the board dealt
[2:17:42] with me about three years ago about it
[2:17:43] and and and see stop it
[2:17:46] you're actually missing now as you're so
[2:17:50] busy looking and building for the future
[2:17:52] you're missing mmm this is Lisa this
[2:17:57] isn't hallelujah that's right
[2:17:58] go God's going to get tired shaking
[2:18:01] gifts before you after a while we sit
[2:18:03] paralyzed that's all they see how he
[2:18:06] sees paralyzed I thought that was quite
[2:18:08] key because you know God's called us to
[2:18:10] live hey man I that's off now he's
[2:18:15] called us to walk he's called us to walk
[2:18:18] and I want to read it I want to read you
[2:18:19] a scripture he sees here
[2:18:29] is here oceans 110 that he might walk
[2:18:32] worthy of the Lord and to all pleasing
[2:18:35] being fruitful remember McCall was not
[2:18:39] fruitful he wants you to walk and to all
[2:18:42] pleasing that were pleasing as I've got
[2:18:47] a powerful meaning I can't remember I
[2:18:49] had a brother that's not him
[2:18:51] you can look it up and see all pleasing
[2:18:53] being fruitful and every good work
[2:18:57] being fruitful in every good work and
[2:19:00] increasing in the knowledge of God
[2:19:01] strengthened with all mine according to
[2:19:04] his glorious power after all patience
[2:19:05] and long-suffering with joyfulness amen
[2:19:09] that word walk means to tread all around
[2:19:13] so you see that David nature you've got
[2:19:17] to take take your land push back the
[2:19:20] enemy and Trent all around because your

[2:19:51] you have to take it back you wake up the
[2:19:54] night you wake up in the morning take it
