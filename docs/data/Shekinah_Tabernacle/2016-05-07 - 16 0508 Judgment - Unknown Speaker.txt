amen hallelujah welcome everyone somebody with testimony this morning Shannon okay again I thought if Lord you want to share this testimony I'll share it with you it's when we were singing delight yourself in the Lord and I was Naomi last night about the testimony about how we okay so um 13 years ago I wanted to be a ranger and I was studying to be this Ranger you know live out in the bush carry a gun it was my ideal and um then when I came to New Zealand it all changed and um I met the Lord then met my husband then ended up being a wife and a mom of three and staying home with children and um you know it says forsake all and follow him amen praise the Lord so you know thoughts came up like once in a while it's like oh didn't know if I wanted this job but I'm here and I'm you know following the Lord and then um we got this place we are at at the atas and one night I was outside um stargazing and just really appreciating what the Lord's made and I really felt his presence come right next to me and it was a presence that I wasn't used to or having experienced before because I couldn't say anything I couldn't worship I couldn't talk to him I couldn't sing to him I couldn't do anything to him he was like he was ministering to me and um I tell them say as you delight yourself in me I Delight in you amen so then I thought oh this I don't want it to just be out of my mind so I checked the scriptures to see about delight and what Psalm is it where it says delight yourself in the Lord and He Shall give you the desires of your heart 36 OR7 and so um 13 years later I'm out in the bush I'm a Ranger with my little Ranger X and it dawned on me it dawned on me that he gave me my desire and it didn't happen straight away but he knew it he placed it in my heart and he fulfilled it everything we ask for is the song says he gives us everything amen and he does yes he does so praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen you Lord amen even the with company amen you know I stood there this morning I stood same thing uh we were talking about you know how privileged we are to live where we live you know because armont and Chantel slept over at that place last night and it was just standing there early in the morning watching the Mist pulling across the hills that's how he has with us he covers us like the Mist covers those mountains you know and he feeds us he gives us what we need he covers Us he clothes us he protects us and he keeps us away from this world Amen even though our flesh wants to go to the world he keeps us away because it is he that is in us our God is good our God is good amen hallelujah thank you Lord let's worship together we have come into this into his [Music] house we have come into his house and gathered in his name to worship him we have

can have your seats um this morning thank you brother John okay so I've got um a little message that I want to bring this morning and it sounds like a um maybe a negative subject but it's really not um and the subject is called judgment amen and it um I'm probably not going to um maybe say a lot of things that you haven't already heard but I'm just going to go through it um from what the Lord sh me about it so far and just work our way through this concept of judgment um and I've had a real blessing getting it together back that a bit bigger and this the um okay I didn't put that font there anyway why is that font funny Brother Andy hope it's not like that through all of them anyway praise the Lord let's um yeah that's fine okay now when I start this I'm going to go quite fast okay is that all right I'm going to run through it quite quick so I'm not going to go slow I've got a little bit to get through it I'm just going to keep going okay so I'll just slow go slow at the start but when I get into it I'll speed it up um because I I it's a sort of thought that if you if you just go through the whole thing it it it can as Peter said you know I'm not telling you things you don't know but I'm just going to stir stir up your remembrance about these things and that's what this has done for me I've just after looking through it I've thought well you know there is actually judgment is in a lot of areas of our life and there's a lot of judgment coming and it's it's not just a story we hear and oh it's far far away it's happening now and it always has been happening and there's a lot on its way to happen and um my scripture this morning is seems funny with the um the subject but it's Isaiah 9:6 it says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor I like counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and it's so good that we have a counselor we have the mighty father and we have the Prince of Peace on our side and you'll see why in the end I use that scripture and I want to Major on the Prince of Peace because after all this we have peace amen okay let's just get into it now can we make that bigger brother someone can we take two minutes and fix that you mind I just I just want to get this so you can see it properly who's had a good week who's had a Victorious week amen um and in a service I was in in Australia there was a sister that had to leave and she was I think she was in a wheelchair and she had to go somewhere and there was all this disruption so the brother said let's sing a song and we sang an EA Palace song and it was um it's me it's me oh Lord you guys know standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer not my my brother but it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer not my brother not my sister not my brother not my sister but it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer amen it sounds like a selfish song but actually it is me standing in the need of prayer we need his mercy and his grace every day good thank you very much that's better um yeah good thank you you can always rely on Brother Andy to get technical stuff sorted out good work okay so this is what I'm going to be going through it's it's a judgment timeline and I'm I'm essentially going to start um here I'm not going to cover those but I'm just going to go from there back through to the end and Zone in on a few things but right throughout time there's been judgments happened to man and God's God's a god of judgment he's implemented judgment many times now we had at the beginning we've got Adam and Eve and then we we understand the story there um how that they sinned and then God proclaimed judgment so that was that was the first judgment that he proclaimed and it was upon Adam and Eve and and they were sent forth from the garden and man fell but that was that was the first judgment really towards man that God made that God implemented I should say and then the next major judgment outside of the flood I haven't got the flood in here is is then he got this idea of judging a lamb a natural lamb it sounds strange but he he he would judge a lamb and say if you would you you can lay your sins upon that lamb and I'll judge that lamb in your place so that was judgment that he judged upon a lamb a natural lamb and then later on he came himself and he took judgment upon himself as the um spiritual lamb and the Bible says it pleased God to bruise him and and that the wrath of God the Judgment of God was poured out upon the upon himself essentially but he played the part of a son so he he took his own judgment upon himself and it wasn't a nice judgment it was a painful hard judgment that he took upon himself so he took judgment himself although he imp he he um implements judgment for our sake he took judgment that's right and that was a major judgment it pleased God to bruise him he he was he poured out his wrath the wrath of God As we sing the song The Wrath of God was satisfied the the fierce judgment he had he could pour it out and he was satisfied with with that so so he took his own judgment there now now for where we're going to go this morning we're going to start from the we're going to go through this in segments but we're going to take it from the the section of judgment between there and the Judgment of the tribulation I'm just going to work in there for a we bit so after he took that judgment then there was another minor judgment happened after that if you go to the next one now the this is not really what I'm going to cover but I just want to cover this the next minor judgment was actually on the Jewish people because he was um trying to save them and help them all the way through but there came a point where he said when they finally rejected the Messiah that was sent to them to take their judgment because that was for the Jews that wasn't for us he took that judgment for them they were his people we weren't his people all of us here were Gentiles he came to his own and his own received them not so his own rejected that substitute rejected the judgment and so the next essentially the next judgment that happened was on his own people he said well I'm going to cut you off and the Bible talks about it in terms of an olive tree and I want to read the scriptures that I've got here because as brother Ram said my words will fail but his won't so if we read the scriptures they won't fail so the Jewish people were cut off from essentially the the the um salvation as as and and God turned to the to the Gentiles but some of them still were saved we understand that but as a nation they were cut off and Romans 11:24 talks about the Olive Tree and it says for if they were cut out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and were grafted and contrary to Nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall those which be the natural branches be grafted into their own Olive Tree so you all understand the um he likened the the this whole thing to an olive tree and he said I've broken off the natural branch which were the Jews and I've grafted in the Gentiles which are us okay and now Paul actually man that when Paul is speaking in Acts 13:46 he said then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold into speaking to the Jews and they said it was necessary that the word of God should have been first should first have been spoken unto you because you were his people but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of eternal life Lo we turn to the Gentiles so he's he's saying this is what's happening now we're turning from you now what we then have is us as Gentiles were grafted into this the the the good things of God into the promise of Abraham Romans 11:9 says Thou wil say then the branches were broken off that's the Jews that I might be grafted in well because of unbelief they were broken off and th stand this by faith be not high minded but fear so saying you were grafted in because the others didn't believe so you believe otherwise you'll be you taken out now I've got this timeline here now at the end here the um the Jews will be grafted back in and we're getting to the point where the where the Gentiles have had their chance and their branch is going to be broken off so we've we've got this period now within this period of time you have the you've got the seven Church ages the seven Messengers and the four beasts and the four horse riders all of this activity happens within this space of time between in the Gentile period here okay go to the next one please now within that space of time there are different people that come along different Gentiles that come along and they they all receive a judgment of sorts as they live through this period of time and they all react differently to this judgment we all receive judgment somehow and depending on what's in Us and how we are is is how we respond and act towards it and if you search it through you'll find that there are there are basically these types of people now I'm not here to name any names or anything like that I'm just here to give a give ideas of what who they are now we obviously know we've got the unbeliever okay now we've got the make believer uh we've got the remnant and the sheep and you'll find why I just called it sheep because the in the great we through judgment talks about the sheep and the goats so there's a there's sheep there and then you've got this you've got people called the friend of the Bride that receive a different judgment and then you've got the bride now everybody fits in one of those categories eventually okay now what I'm going to do is just go through these ones and just see how they would respond to judgment because we all get judged in this life now that's right there are many judgments that we face okay now the first one please now the unbeliever the unbeliever is a is a person that doesn't really care about the things of God whatsoever he couldn't care less and when the Judgment of God comes across his path to show maybe hey you're wrong maybe you shouldn't be doing those things he doesn't care there's nothing in him to respond to that judgment he doesn't care now the Romans 1:26 says for this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their woman did change the natural use of that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust toward one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly receiving in themselves the that recompense of the error which was met and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God G gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murdered debate deceit malignity Whisperers backb backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them okay now these people don't care about God or his ways whatsoever they actually enjoy going against it now the Bible talks about them it says the Lord knowth how to deliver The Godly out of Temptation and to reserve the unjust until the day of judgment to be punished so now they may at some point get a get a a a judgment of God upon their life here to say look what you're doing is wrong but they will just turn it away and say I don't care yeah essentially they receive no more judgment here they just keep doing what they're doing and they enjoy it and what they're doing is storing up judgment against the day of Wrath so they're building up and account you wonder why the wicked man can do all these sorts of things and seem to get away with it and we do one thing we can't get away with it because they judge they're not getting away with it don't worry about that but it's being stored up against the day of Wrath that's what's happening they receed no more judgment that's what's happening there but after the Romans 2:5 says but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasur up thyself wrath against the day of Wrath that's that's the Judgment at the end and the revelation of the righteous Judgment of God that's why David said don't look at the evil doer don't look at the choose none of his ways don't look at him and think he's doing that maybe I could do that and get away with it he said don't do that because there's judgment coming for them but they receive no no more there's a point where they receive no more judgment here aside from maybe you reap what you sow in terms of natural sense now brother Brown talks about the unbeliever with this here he says you remember years ago many of you he the old times remember that sermon I preached on the disappointments of judgment he said the Harlot she ain't going to be disappointed there she knows where she's going the drunkard ain't going to be disappointed there the bootleg The Gambler the liar the thief he's not going to be disappointed they know where they're going they know what they're doing they don't care that's the unbeliever okay move to the next one oh this is a story that I've got although this was there are times when they do get judged here just I I don't know why but they just do there was a brother Brown told a story about how him and a couple of about four other minister Brothers went to a city and um they were on one side of the street and they crossed over the street and they what you call walked across the street and there was a policeman down the road we ways and he said he said hey boys you're jay walking what do you think you're doing and they said jay walking what do you mean jay walking we we're from they were from Louisiana they're in another state they said we can walk anywhere we want to back home we didn't realize you couldn't jwalk here and he said no you you know you're not supposed to jwalk here you guys are just getting smart to me and you know you saw me there and there you just did this in front of me and he this policeman really started hassling brother Bram and his friends about jaywalking and and he really and they said to him look we're telling you the honest truth you know we're Ministers of the Gospel we're not we're not doing this to you know be smart to you we just didn't realized that we were doing this and so he really started heading into them once they said they ministers and oh here you guys call yourselves ministers and now look what you're doing these sorts of things and these brothers were trying to not argue back to him but State their cases to say look we were we were innocent we if we if we knew there was a rule we would have just maybe crossed over in a certain place he wouldn't believe them and he was really um hitting away at them and brother Brandon was starting to talk back too but he said something said to him just leave it alone he said um be not deceived and this the Holy Ghost gave him the scripture said be not deceived God is Not mock whatsoever man s that shall he also reap and so he just left it that and let this guy let off his Steam and he was he wanted to take him to court and all these sorts of things really nasty nasty man for no reason they stayed there for a couple of days and they they um when they went to go brother R and picked them up was going to pick them up from the the um where they stayed and they were driving along and then brother bam says and we started driving out and I took them back to the to their place about six blocks away or a little more and I came back around just in time to see the man this is the policeman um tried to run around the man making a right hand turn and was crushed under the wheels I stopped my car and pulled over to one side to be sure if that was a policeman and it was he'd run under a truck making a right hand turn policeman's fault slid his tire sideways went right through the big wheels of that truck there he was mashed up legs broke arms broke couldn't scream he's out unconscious pulled him out and then I stood there and thought now what about it so now he'll receive more judgment in the world to come but he also received the Judgment here um but that doesn't always happen like that like someone may do that to us and nothing happens to them but sometimes it does happen like um with the prophets in the bible and that okay the next one is the this is a really evil one here the make believer the unbeliever is not so bad because he doesn't pretend anything he's just he is who he is he's quite easy to deal with but the make believer I think is one of the most evil people you can get because they they are absolutely from Satan but they they pretend like they're from God and they're out to deceive good people that want to serve God and want to seek God and these people hinder them I think this is just these are the most evil people you can you can get now I'm not going to name any names but this group here cuz there are group and Jesus was blunt with them when he talk to them he said you're of your father the Devil he's talking to these make Believers that that are actually in infiltrated the church everywhere and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it now this group here don't have when the when the truth comes across their path I'll put it this way the the unbeliever just has to have a an idea that maybe there's a God and maybe you should behave yourself and that's enough for him to say I don't care there's no God I'll just do what I want these people here have to have a bit more of a judgment made to them to discern who they are so if you try and tell an unbeliever God sent a prophet he doesn't care whether there's a prophet or not that won't really affect him if you just say there is a God he'll say I don't care so saying there's a prophet is not going to affect him either either way he doesn't care about it but these people here the way that God has has has has put a separating line between these people he has to hone it down a bit more because they claim to be Christians and Believers you see so he has to hone it down a bit more and that's when we get into the area that we deal in a bit more which is recognizing your day and its message right you understand because it's got to come in and separate these people out it's it's Jesus came and he separated these people out who they were because he honed down into Christian things into religious things and and it was the word for that day was manifested you understand so that that these people show their Colors by their fruits you shall know them and and it's it's what they do with the word for their day discerns who they are you understand it has to come and it has to come and judge them that way and so this this word can come to them in the Right Through the Ages the the the Word of Life the message for the hour has come to them and they they will fight against it it has to manifest who they they will fight against it so they actually they receive opportunity for salvation hey do you want to come and accept the truth they say no we don't want that then they actively fight against it from then on you understand so they they received they received a judgment shown that hey you're wrong maybe you should go this way they said no I don't want that I'll go this way and then they actively fight against against God for the rest of their life okay and that's why Romans 66 talks about if they shall fall away so they they maybe have an opportunity to start walking in these things and they say no I don't want it then it says if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God a fresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and briers is nigh to cursing whose end is to be burned now in them is a their Thorns to begin with right so even when they get this anointing all that brings forth a thorn it doesn't bring forth fruit because they're not actually one of gods now this sounds hard I'm not going to that's why I'm not mentioning any people but this is Godly principles that we have to look into go to the next one I just want to read this here from brother brandom he said now this this is a continu the last quote that we read watch it now it's not just purely old everyday sin committing adultery getting drunk using God's name in vain that's not it you remember years ago and here's the quote I read before many of you here the old times remember that sermon I preached on the disappointments that judgement the Harlot she ain't going to be disappointed there she knows where she's going the drunker ain't going to be disappointed there The Bootlegger The Gambler the liar the thief he's not going to be disappointed but the man who thinks he's right there's the disappointment that fellow that said he come said Lord have not I preached the gospel have not I cast out devils in thy name Jesus said depart from me ye that work iniquity I never know you there's a disappointment see that deceitfulness that's what I'm constantly this is what brother saying that's that's where I'm so misunderstood it's not that I want to be different of don't want to be different but I've got to be honest I have a message that must go to the people makes it very much misunderstood amongst the people they think I'm against everybody if they only knew I'm for everybody and try my best to bring them what's the truth just as it's laid on my heart and the way it's laid out in the Bible here and God proves that to be the truth so there's nothing else can be done about it so men either they look at it or they don't see they don't want to see it because they've already sold out sold their Birthright to some organization some denomination to tie their birth rights to get to heaven upon the basis of some organized religion which Satan is the head of every bit of it that sounds a bit like Jesus when he said you're of your father the Devil he's come along saying Satan's ahead of all this stuff and all I'm coming here is trying to actually help you to get out of it but of course the the make believer doesn't want out because there's nothing in them to get out God never did have an organized religion never did and they sell out to that so this is this is part of the battle that we and what we do we fight against this as well as the unbeliever now next one okay now in order to to not make it sound so hard there's also what they call there's the The Remnant and the Sheep now brother Brown talks about the foolish the wise and the foolish virgins and there's a there's a scripture about the wise and the foolish virgins now there are 10 virgins and the Bible says five are wise and five are foolish and when you look into it you think well both of these here are both these virgins doing the the best they can living as good as they can they both they're both essentially Christian people the the difference is half of them have the Holy Ghost and half of them don't and so when the Bride Comes to catch the bride away the ones with the Holy Ghost go with them but you've still got these five left that are actually very sincere and they they're doing the best that they can but they don't go into the wedding now these people it's hard wee bit to think about it but these people aren't lost they're not lost these brother Adam calls them the remnant and now they have to go through the tribulation there but they're not lost now Remnant he gives an example he says if a if a if a someone is making a dress and they've got a pattern and they get a big piece of cloth their pattern requires this piece and that piece and that piece so they sit out their pattern onto this piece of cloth and they cut out all of their pattern patterns that they need to sew their dress together and he said look it was all good cloth there was nothing wrong with the cloth all the cloth was good the only thing was he he just put his pattern on it and he only needed these pieces out of the cloth he doesn't really need the rest of the cloth to make the dress but it was good cloth it was he said it's just by election that he just chose these little pieces out of it but the rest of the cloth is still good now that's what the remnant is it's just not elected to be the bride but it's not going to be lost do you understand okay we don't need to read that one I just explain that one there next one now brother talks about this here and he says you might different a little with this but just but listen close just because you accepted Christ as personal savior that doesn't mean that you're going on the Rapture that's for the elect right with the Holy Ghost with the cloth there will be a Remnant left here on Earth that will go through the persecution and Great Tribulation the church will be caught up in the Rapture he's talking about the the bride will be caught up in the Rapture how many woman here doesn't know when you're going to cut a piece of goods you lay the goods out that's and lay your pattern on it like this and you cut the goods just according to the pattern is that right and the rest of the goods is just the same kind of goods that's in the pattern is that right but this is the kind you take you might lay that away for further use but but the goods that you cut out of who places a pattern God by election amen God by election places a Pat and he said now I've chosen you before the foundation of the world I know places here and there while Jesus told the disciples that he was with them and he had chose them and he knew them before the foundation of world was ever laid is that right so God placed is a pattern now there will be elect that'll go on the Rapture and there'll be a group of people that's good upright holy living God saved people that will that will not be in the Rapture but they will come up in the second Resurrection okay now the Sheep are also in that section as well now Romans 8:9 says but ye not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ there is none of his now when you read that scripture with just understanding you realize one of his means one of his bride you know you you want one of his bride but there all there are people that are going to be in heaven that are not his bride but they're going to be there okay because you can't not everyone that say goes to the how would you put it there's the make believer and then there's people right throughout those organizations that are not make Believers but they're not they're not going to turn away everything but there's just nothing in them really to receive the Holy Ghost okay next one this is a story that brother brandham talked about and you'll find this interesting in light of what we just talked about um and I don't want to start a new doctrine of you know if you just do something good you're going to be saved it's not about that but nonetheless this is what the scripture say this is what brother Brown talked about brother Brown told a story about an old doctor and he said speaking to an old doctor yesterday one of my doctor friends Budd he's 80 something years old he said and a sister-in-law here at the church tonight A sister-in-law is here at the church church tonight and this is what I want to look into and she's been just a teeny weeny bit worried about him so this is a sister going to church thinking and her brother is brother-in-law is is dying and and she's obviously thinking you know he's never really been a Christian or otherwise brother wouldn't say this so he said I'm a bit worried about him okay that's that's what this and I went to see him and as soon as I began to talk to him he brightened up told me about a hunting trip he had taken many years ago up in Colorado the very same country I hunted just as brilliant and bright and I said Doctor how long you been practicing and he said when you were nursing so well you were still breastfeeding I was practicing and way down I said and many a time he said I've practiced taking my buggy I put my saddle bags over my horse I took the little satchel and I've walked and I said yes down along the creek Banks 2:00 in the morning with your flashlight trying to find a house where a little child had a tummy ache or a mother in labor pains he said that's right and I said you know doctor I believe across the this dividing line between here between Mortal and immortality God has a place for good old doctors that serve like that great tears came in his eyes and he started crying he reached up his feeble hands and said brother I hope so across the land god judges a man's Soul what he is then I gave him the satisfying scripture many times plowing through those dark muddy fields at night trying to help somebody maybe never get a penny for it but it's all right I said Jesus said in the scripture blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy okay now I can't just go and say this you'll be right cuz you did this nice thing nonetheless he he said here look God's going to judge this man according to his works and he told his sister-in-law just don't worry about it it's going to be all right okay now next one I want to give some other few examples who's heard of the chattam islands okay I've just used this as a we just to not that I know what's happening here or not that I know God's thoughts on it but it's an interesting story about this so the chattam islands are to the east of New Zealand and they were populated by uh uh um um tribe or I guess people called moror people and I think when they turned up they would have these intertribal they would have fights and that sort of thing but one of the Le Chiefs um saw the the Carnage that was happening when they were always fighting because it's not a massive Island um I think it's it's about the size of bigger than Lake Tapo but it's it's a reasonable size um so he he implemented rules about how they were supposed to live and he basically he said look we're not going to fight each other and kill each other that's not going to happen um and he made laws that look if you if you guys get into an argument if you want to have a have a fight he said because men get angry and during such anger feel the will to strike that that so they may but only with the rod the thickness of a thumb and one stretch of the arms length so they they're allowed to stick about that long and they said they can hit each other and he said but that on the abrasion of the height or the first sign of blood you stop that's it no more fighting and that he implemented a pacifist culture where you actually don't fight each other don't kill each other we're going to we're not going to do it and these Mori people live by that code all the way through now in the um the the 1800s a the moldi a lot of moldy guys from Teran I A Tribe hijacked a ship and they went across through the chattam islands and another ship followed after them there were hundreds of them there were thousands of moru moru on this island here and um the Marys began to slaughter them and the Mori had a meeting and some of them wanted to go and fight fight back at these marry Invaders but the Chiefs gathered around they said look we didn't just start this code you know it wasn't based on circumstance there this is how we operate so we're not going to fight back against these people so that's what they said now as a result the majority of them were slaughtered and and killed mercilessly on some of them on Stakes on the beach for days it was just it was an awful thing that happened to them but they didn't fight back because they live by this code that we're just not going to operate that way now I don't know when judgment comes what what's going to happen I don't know but but someone did something good for these people and said you're going to live like this and he would have saved many lives throughout the existence of that Nation by saying you're not going to kill each other now what will his judgment be I don't know but it'll come up before God at some point and and these people he'll be judged I don't know they didn't hear the gospel so far as I'm aware German missionaries came in after that so so this is just an example of there are circumstances that we know nothing of that God will be the judge of these sorts of things we don't know next one while I was looking at this I found this interesting article so I thought I'd put it up they found dinosaur bones there bones from a 4 ton meat eating dinosaur have been uncovered on the chattam islands they said Australian paleontologist Jeffrey Stillwell of Melbourne's monach University found a 2 km long deposit of bones teeth and clawes and is already uncover more dinosaur fossils in the chattam islands than have been Unearthed in New Zealand over the past 25 years question why are there dinosaur bones on a small island in the middle of nowhere cuz at one point it was land before the flood and there were many dinosaurs there I just thought that these people are saying oh that was when the land all continents drifted apart and no no no there was more land than what there was water at some point and there were heaps of dinosaurs around here and they found a lot of dinosaur bones I just thought put that in there that was interesting you know when you're doing these things you get sidetracked sometimes onto little stories next one now we've got the next people that we call that the friend of the bride now I want to give you some scriptures on here Mark 9:41 says for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verely I Stand to you he shall not lose his reward and we've got this one over here this is also the Sheep one but I'll just put in here and the King shall answer and sayto them verely verely I say unto you in as much as you have done it unto the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me the reason why I put this old man up there with a bag was because my father told me a story when um he was newly married and they maybe had one or two children and they lived on the west coast Inland from Hamilton towards um the west coast and my mother would have to take a bus into Hamilton or Huntley wherever it was to go shopping once every two weeks and she would come back with all her um shopping bags and she would have maybe one or two babies with her and there was a man that lived nearby where they lived an older man and it would happen that quite often he would be on this bus with her on the same Journey so um this old man would always help my mother carry all her bags and always help her to get to where she was going I don't think they really knew him that well but he would just do this towards them um and then my father says that um he was out um fencing one day and a thought came to him and said pray for that man and he thought well I'm just thinking that I'll just carry on doing my fencing and he said the thought came to me even more you need to pray for that man and so he thought well this must be the Lord saying something so he stopped fencing and he said oh what do I pray for for him about and and the S said to him and as much as you have done it to the least of the is my bre and You' have done it unto me so so he prayed for this man he said Lord I pray for him and as much as he's done it to the least he is my bre and he's done it unto me and he went home that night and my my mother said oh I just found out that s so passed away later on this afternoon something happened there something happened some transaction took took place there was some remembrance happen now that will come up at some point so there are look this is just a bit of advice if someone does something nice to you sometimes it's family and that thank God say Lord I thank you for that person a family member may just drop something off to you say Lord I Thank you for them doing that for me I really it really blessed me just speak it out there's people in my family that I that you know sometimes you you shouldn't say it but you lose a bit of Hope after a while but these people every now and then I've got some random package in the mail with all of the stuff for my children or something like that and I thought Lord I Thank you for this person that they did this for me this has been a real blessing towards me and and I know if if nothing else on the day of judgment I'll bring that up and I'll say yeah I actually got this package from this person and it will it will replay what happened that's just a just do that you just never know what it might do amen okay next one the judgment on those ones was I don't know how it works but they just they don't reject but they don't accept it's just I don't know how that one works so I can't say about the The Remnant or the friend of the Bride I can't really speak on that now the True Believer the True Believer has a way bit of a different journey in his life because now as does the unbeliever and the make believer he gets judgment come across his path saying that he's wrong something he shouldn't be living like this and that you know if he's walking away something convicts his heart okay now the difference with the with the True Believer is something in him says yes you know what I'm wrong and it starts to stir up in his heart and he can't rest until he he just okay he needs to know the answer then if I'm wrong what's the answer amen something in him just cries out for it he's made that way that's why in Acts 237 after Peter finished preaching those that the True Believers that had something in them to receive it they said that's the Bible says they are pricked to the heart something in them said yes for hundreds of people have said no no we don't want this but these men said yes and they said un to Peter and the rest of them men and Brethren what shall we do they not only are they convinced they're concerned brother B talks about convinced concerned there's something in them that they they want to they just okay what's the answer if I'm wrong I want to know how do I get right and they won't stop seeking and searching and pressing and doing this until they receive until they get the solution to the problem which is if I'm wrong I want to be right yeah because that's what's in them and acts 13:48 says and when the Gentiles heard this where after they heard Paul preach the whole bunch of people tried to Stone Paul but then other people said they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed now the True Believer has a has a nature in him that that he fulfills Luke 14:33 that says so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he had he cannot be my disciple there's something in him that he knows come what may regardless it doesn't matter what I have to give up what obstacle will come in the way I don't care I want this he will fulfill that scripture now it doesn't mean that He will forsake but if if push comes to he's going to forsake everything he doesn't care amen if it's his wife he'll say well then if you don't want me to go this way I'm going this way anyway I don't care if it comes down to it he will just like Abraham was willing to sacrifice his own son because he wanted to follow the lord now that's the nature of the way that he is he will just say yes I'm going um and that's now brother talks about this here and the token he says now when you want eternal life you receive a token showing that the price has been paid it isn't the blood but it's the token of the blood it's the life itself amen then he says full obedience to the to the whole word of God to God's entire word will entitle you to this token now within the believer the True Believer is the desire to just yes I surrender all I'm going to be fully obedient to your word it's they just they just want to Something in them wants to and that's why they receive the Holy Ghost receive the token because they want to forsake all and just serve him when they receive this judgment they they press on towards it now how do you do it Peter still on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the token for the promises unto you and to your children to them the far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall all so now we here are believers okay True Believers so now we receive this judgment and we've and it moves us and we we want to be right with God we want to we want to just forsake all and serve him okay now go to the next one right we had a sin issue in our life we we were separated from God and when we realized that we didn't want to be because part of us is supposed to be with him so now we we make this effort we just say Lord whatever I just want I want Mercy I want I want that so when we receive that mercy and we receive Holy Ghost we receive all of this that's dealing with the sin question in our life it's it's it it just disappears although we and the brother Ben talked about this last week some with a capital S and some with a lowercase s right because of that's the nature of how we operate John said and and the Book of Jesus says verely verely I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath Everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto life okay whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for he cannot sin because he is born of God this sin question with the capital S gets done away with dealt with for the believer he doesn't have any sin it's gone it's it's he accepts salvation he accepts the Holy Ghost and he becomes born of God sin and it doesn't matter what he does from then on he could no sin gets attributed to him whatsoever nothing he could ever do can never get put on his account his account gets closed you understand he closed account he sin is gone it doesn't he cannot commit sin a Christian doesn't sin full stop you understand they don't sin but then they still kind of do so you think well this is this is odd now this is then now because judgment came our way and we we accepted judgment we took we took that Judgment of God to say we're wrong we say yes we're wrong now this is where the believer has a a different Journey than the rest of the world and that we then begin to receive our judgment every day daily we start to receive judgment now that doesn't mean do we have a capital l sin no that's what we're talking about now the little sin it just it's sin but it's not getting put on our account but it's sin nonetheless but now it gets judged you sin you get judged sin judged sin judged that that's how it operates now with us and our natural life but it's doesn't mean oh I'm saved I'm not I'm saved I'm not no no you're saved period full stop this is now the little sin right and this is now where the chastisement comes into it and correction comes into the believer Hebrews 12:5 says and ye have forgotten exaltation what speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth he's dealing with the little he's he's dealing with the same sin but it's just little sin it's it's no worse or better but it's just he starts dealing that way encourage every son whom he receiveth if ye your a chastening god dealth with you as Sons why because you're a Son of God you have received the Holy Ghost you're one of his for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all all all the Believers are partakers then you are illegitimate us another word but yeah illegitimate and not Sons if you don't receive this it shows that you're actually not a son of God so the the make believer doesn't receive this this chastisement as what we would my father was walking along he told me another story and I've forgotten it I won't tell it sorry if it comes back to me I'll tell it y it's back to me a um I forgot it again sorry I won't tell there was a bit of a [Laughter] flip-flop it was a very good story but I'll maybe a tell Fellowship move on to the next one please so now now this is what happens now to the believer for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be to them that obey not the gospel of God we begin to receive judgment daily in our lives and the Bible says but when we are judged judged for all these things we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world now that doesn't mean we're judged the condemnation but we're judged because we're one of his okay now I want to just um now no doubt if if you've been a partaker of this you know that you do something you think if you do something wrong you think ouch okay something's on its way I'll be very surprised if I get away with this one you just know now that's because you're a son and daughter of God okay listen to Brother Andy he knows all about this you brother hey some of us take a you know you got children some are quite I and they they're more submissive and some are a bit more harder they need to be whipped into shape a bit more brothery I want to give you a few examples of this just to you'll have these in your own life but these are kind of comical but they are this is want to show you how the Lord deals I've had some very harder dealings where the Lord's I've had big price to pay for things but other things like this it's it's a bit more it's not humorous because it was still annoying to go through but these are examples I want to show you about this one um go to the next [Laughter] one this is a recent one no tomorrow so um I they brought in a new rule in New Zealand that says you can't talk on your phone while you're driving and now I had a bad habit of talking on my phone while I was driving cuz I just always had to talk to people while I was driving because it's a good time you get in a car and you're driving for an hour it's the time to catch up on all your phone calls and that so when the rule changed I didn't really change with it and I think I got two fines over the course of about 18 months for driving with my using my cell phone now but I just kept on doing it because I kind of had to it was just such a habit and I i' um phone people I check my texts check my emails check the bank whatever do just do business man you get a lot done in an hour driving from Wellington to carpy Coast um now the funny thing was when I would go into prayer in the evenings I would say you know you want to just get into an atmosphere and then and you want to say Lord is there anything that I'm doing that's that's not right you know it's not pleasing to you that I could um that you want to show me and a thought would come up you got to stop talking on your phone while you're driving it's a bad testimony you just got to stop it's not right that's people look at you and say here he's a Christian look at him driving around talking on his phone but God didn't explain like that he just said you got to stop doing that I'll stop doing that I'm sorry and I'll do it the next day then the next night I say that's right I did it today I'll stop doing that but there wasn't really enough in me to really give it up because it was just so convenient to talk on my phone and I but but every time I would do it I would think I'm sure there's going to be something happened because I'm doing this it just this is just getting a bit too easy to do it doesn't seem to be very many consequences for this it's what I started thinking so yeah no it doesn't really work that way because God wants to improve us amen that's what he wants to do he's not just going to leave us a good parent doesn't just leave us so now one day I'm driving along into going to appointment in the city and um I'm talking to brother Ian on the phone you know we having to catch up in the morning and I'm driving along and I see a I see a sign on the overhead um barrier on the motorway and it says accident head take extra care and and I I think and I think brother andyw love for me to send him a picture of that because he hates people crashing on the motorway he thinks what sort of a stupid person would crash on the motorway what sort of drivers are they you know that's just a Motorway you're just driving along don't crash it's so simple and yet they crash Hold Me Up Hold everyone up so I'm talking to about the Ann on the phone I think oh bro hang on I just got to there's a funny sign up the head I'm just going to start my photo on my phone and I'll just take a picture of that cuz I'm going to send it through to Brother Andy because he'll he'll think that's funny so I say wait there a minute so as I'm talking to him I'm getting my photo out right and I take a photo of that and I look down at it I think now it's too small I can't quite see the sign so I hang on brother in so I go to the next one hang on oh no no one before that oh go one more before yeah that's the first one okay so I think it's a bit too small I can't see the he won't recognize the sign so I take it up and take another one that's about pretty good there get a bit closer yeah I'll take a photo next one there yep it's pretty good then I put my phone down I look ahead of me and there's a car stopped there bang I crashed into him the minute I crashed I thought I knew it I knew it I knew it that was me I just I knew I'd pay for this at some point I I just I there was getting out of hand talking and photos and you know it was all on I just thought no I I knew I'd pay for this and he was mad rightfully so he was angry and I just took it all he was just angry at me getting out of the car and I said what can you say you know what it's happened his car wasn't too badly damaged but I want to tell you this here too now I started talking to that he called the police and I had to give my statement and I thought thought oh man I'm going to be in trouble for this with the police as well so I started saying I said I was just driving along and I was going to change lanes and then I looked there was a car there and I just hit him and the policeman said yeah yeah yeah that's he was a young guy said yeah this is nothing just happens about once or twice a day yeah yeah just another day in the office somebody said to me you didn't tell him the whole truth of what happened and I I had to sign a statement right and I signed it and someone said to me if you don't tell them the truth you're going to pay for this one too I thought oh man I I'm I could probably just not tell him then ring him up afterwards and I thought the effort I'm going to have to go through to try and retract my statement and all that I thought oh man this is going to be tough but some said you got to tell him the truth so he came back over and I said hey um can I just add a wee bit more to my statement he goes yeah yeah sure and I said to him look this is what I was doing man I was driving along I said I was talking on the phone to my my friend and then I saw a sign that said accident and I and I started the photo up and I took a photo I was taking photos with my phone as well as talking on it and then when I looked up I crashed into the sky and this man says the polican says look he didn't know what to say he's like look I'm not going to put that in there he said look I appreciate that you've told me that but that's going to create a whole lot of work for me I'm going to have to take you through the court system and that he said I just I'm too busy to do that but he walked away came back he said look that was one in a million no one's ever did that to me before he said he said he said well okay but I really appreciate your honesty man good yeah and I said so he let me off he said look that's yeah look don't worry about it it's done I'm just going to leave it the way it is this will just go away but so I'm glad I was honest about that one because I would have got something else I haven't had this car for two or three months man I get it back tomorrow at 12:00 I got a text so I've had to it's been a bit of a price to pay so I try not to use my phone I'm driving anymore yeah yeah that's what it's yeah yeah yeah yeah this one here it actually I'm not um have I got time for one more real quick on okay you may have heard this one but some of you may have not I think I've said it once here but it goes well with this with the story of how the Lord just gets us to a spot so I this was back in Gisborne maybe eight seven eight years ago and there was a young guy that started working for me and he was uh trying to be a Christian so he after a while he came to me and said can you help me in my walk with the Lord can you disciple me a bit because he saw that I was maybe quite steady in the Lord he said can you help me I want you to help me toop me in the Lord and help me to get my walk stable and that sort of thing so I said yeah I can help you with that so so that was our relationship but he worked for me too and um one day him and my brother was supposed to be on a job and they were supposed to go to this job and that job and that job and they just weren't where they were supposed to be and I don't know when sometimes you just get angry with the stuff cuz people are ringing you up they want to know where's this guy where's that guy and you can't they're not there and you can't get hold of them and you just get angry well I did at that point anyway frustrated to the word I'm frustrated look I've never been so angry for a long time and and now this is what I did I think I told you some of you this before I got so angry in the car that I I just I couldn't hold in my frustration with the situation any longer that I swore out loud in the car no one was in there just me I was so angry and I sort of thought I wonder if that was bad and I I drove along and I thought well if no one's really there to hear it I wonder if it's actually wrong cuz I didn't swear I didn't do it to anybody cuz I I don't swear these guys never heard me but I I thought it was I was trying to reason it so it's probably okay you probably get away with this one but then a scripture came to me let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth well even though there's no one to hear it it still came out no but that wasn't really enough I was still angry but wild about it I was worked up and then I finally got hold of the guy I rang him up I said hey where are you guys man so I found out where they were and they were somewhere they shouldn't be and they were just having a lunch and I said cool man sweet see you later I'll catch you later on I was so angry I put the phone down on the side of the car I was parked up put it down there and I was angry and I went and I did it once more about twice I was angry and then then I thought I'll better calm down I ring my brother see where he is so I picked up the phone and it was still on I hadn't hung up no no sorry sorry i' I left a message with him sorry I left a message on his phone that's what it was I left a message I said can you come and see can you get back to me I need to know where you are straight away actually sorry that's what it was and I put the phone down then I went to pick it up again I thought it's still recording a message on his phone oh I thought no you know the scripture gave to me before now I just did it again now I've recorded it onto this young guy's phone that I'm trying to disciple in the Lord I thought oh man this say I'm in a awful State I thought the Lord's got me you wouldn't believe what I did so I went around to the place where I thought they were I turned up there now the reason why I he didn't ask for his phone it's because he was sitting there and I was like whoa oh there's his phone okay there's opportunity here to maybe get rid of the evidence so I took his phone and I was like I didn't cuz I thought man I've got this reputation to keep up now I'm sworn on his answer machine I I can't do this so I I went down to the warf I thought do I do it do I just Chuck his phone and then when and he wonders where it's gone I'll say oh look bro it's a shame about your phone look look you work for me I'll buy another one you know have yeah you know so I thought I'll justify it by buying him one the things they trying to do to cover Your Tracks so then I thought no I thought no give up just give it all up you put his phone back and tell him the truth I said okay right so I went back put his phone back and I said look bro this is what I did you're going to have a message on your phone I was angry I and I just conf to him and he said hey he actually really appreciated that that he said man this is good I I I respect you for doing that and so I'm having to confess to a younger guy of course then he said ah I'll check my message now but but look I paid for it that's just the way that it went now we have those experiences in our life that we we have to deal now so that these are light-hearted ones to agree I still had to pay a price but there are other ones that I've paid more of a price than than that but when we do what's right the Lord ALS also blesses us you remember brother B talking about the girl that in her school she stood up for what was right and the other girls were hesting her but she stood up for what was right I think in the school picture they wanted her to dress a certain way she said no I want to I want to dress like this and she stood out a bit in the school photo and then I think the next month or something later she won a big competition the big sign competition or came second and brother Brandon went and said to her she said he said she he said you won that because of what you did back there God actually blessed you for that so it doesn't just go that way it goes both ways now we're not earning our way to heaven but just as much as we can displease God we can actually and we can grieve the Holy Ghost we can actually live at peace with God and be at peace with the Holy Ghost and yeah just like a relationship you know there's things you can do in your relationship with your wife to make it good or Worse okay so that and that's it's not works but it's actually love okay next one I want to carry on we've got a little bit we're going to make it through this we've got 20 minutes left we'll get it through now the the we were dealing with these are this area in here okay now we're coming up now to the the um tribul the next major judgment is the Tribulation if I had two parts I'd probably stop it here and do the next one another time but go to the next one brother Andy now now after all this is finished there's a judgment on its way now heading to us and we're in the beginnings of it called the Great Tribulation now it's judgment upon this world because the cup of the iniquity of the Gentiles is becoming full and it's just there's judgment on its way severe judgment and it's it's the Judgment of the Great Tribulation now if you remember the five different people that we had back in the beginning there's only one group that doesn't go through this before this happens there's a Rapture but all of the rest of the people have got to face this judgment that's coming but but but brother bam I'll go through the next one brother B talks about it he says I believe that the church goes through the tribul period Church organization but the bride does not would you choose a woman you had to purify before you married her God's bride is chosen and she's elected and she's God's bride the Bride of Jesus Christ and he talks about the Judgment as a purification time for the for the foolish virgin for these for this in Revelations 22 talks about the tribulation it says he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he which is that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still because after the bride's gone salvation that the door for Mercy for opportunity for salvation is done so the way that you are is the way you'll stay and that's what the scripture says if you're if you're this way you'll just stay that way you'll go through it this way if you're righteous you'll go through it that way but but you're not going to come and change the status of who you are from now this is the way this is the way you're going to head into this great judgment period next one next next one please um now now I've got these I've got these quotes that brother Brown talked about cuz he he he says look it's Mana going to mana's actually going to blow himself up he's going to bring it on himself and he he talks a lot about how it's going to be an atomic event that's just that's the way it's going to happen now I've got these quotes as you read through all the quotes you realize it's this he talks a lot about this Jesus even said as it was in the days of no we in eight Souls were saved by water so shall I be the coming of the son of man all of all this you see walking on the street is Canon fodder that's Atomic fod only laid in there for judgment the Rapture comes here will be scarce few straight As the gate and narrow as the way and but few they will be that find it for broad is the road that leads to destruction and many there be that go and there at he's talking about the tribulation he's saying pretty much what you see here is is atomic fodder that's a hard statement but he's saying the bride's going to go and then it's just it's just fod for the atomic bombs just to blow the whole thing up that's a hard statement but that's it and he says the world's hanging Yonder the atomic bombs is in the hangers and God speaking through his servants into the churches and pulling them out and showing the signs that he promised he would do just before the coming where at the end time the token is required so he's getting his people and and and selling them in to get them out before before all this stuff happens he's saying these atomic bombs are all just hanging there ready to go they're in the hangers next one I've got four of these just to cement it in next one when that radar screen picks up that atomic bomb when they when when some country sees the first one going he says every one of them is going to turn loose it's going to happen wow if you fire one at me boom I fire one back but the church will be gone before that so that could so if that can happen any minute and the church has to go before that happens how far is it off and the Very things that he said would happen as a Ministry and what would take place in the last days we watch it night after night and day after day saying the time is at hand oh we ought to Humble ourselves and get in humility and get into action these things are sitting in the hangers the next one the atomic bomb are in the hangers everything sitting ready and God before he can let this thing happen he makes a call down through like he did in Sodom come out of it get ready there's something going to happen this is where we this the time we dwell in next one okay now this is talking about the battle of Armageddon and he gathered them together into a place in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon and and the seventh angel poured out his violin to the air and there came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and Thunders and Lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the Earth so mighty an earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the Nations fell and great Babylon came in remembrance before God to receive judgment to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath and every island fled away and the mountains were not found and there fell upon men a great hail Out of Heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and Men blessed blem God because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great now now the the the tribulation period is starting to set in now but when the bride goes it it just sets in and it culminates in this thing that we call Armageddon it just it's just Annihilation brother R says it's finally winding up into the great battle of Armageddon that will be the last of it when she comes to the battle of Armageddon that will settle the whole thing just before the great Millennium Armageddon is to clean off the Earth she rep purifies itself with this Atomic blowing with the and the volcanic ash and thing sinks the soaked blood of men upon the Earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the Earth the volcanic breaks out again and renews and cleans the Earth for the great Millennium he cleans his church during that time for a people to live here amen so um the tribulation culminates with this event that just annihilates what he called Atomic fod now yeah I want to talk about this is just to make it reality to us the these are these are the countries that have the atomic bombs and Russia's got more than America Russia has 8,500 estimate and America's Got 7,700 the other countries have a few you know up to 300 France Pakistan they don't know how many Israel has it doesn't really disclose the information but between America and um Russia what's that 15 16,000 there's a lot of atomic bombs and these are these are in submarines they're in hangers they're just they're all sitting there you push that button these things go it's there's enough Firepower to just blow us up done that's the end of story right that's where brother R says that's where science will take us go to the next one and just to make it real they they're all sitting in the the red ones are actually where they got major um Americans have got major um missile like in the hangers yeah and the blue the green are nuclear power stations the blue are um where they they make the bombs and that sort of thing but but the country look they're all across the country they're sitting there waiting and they're on what they brother talk calls about the hangers which they're actually they're they're in like silos in the ground and and it's a it's all CAU anded off and these these nuclear warheads are just sitting in these silos and they always ready to be launched at any point and they've got a lot in the nuclear submarines out in the oceans and that but these these things as we speak today are sitting there ready to the button to be pushed now I got this photo because when you think about this this this is actually an artist rendition of of a a a nuclear bomb coming out of one of these solos out of the ground it may just be a a normal day just it's out in the field it's the grass everything is there it's it's another day in the life of the world but you imagine when this happens when when this bomb leaves that Silo Something's Happened to cause it to leave it it's it's it's the beginning of the end of all things it's just it's done this thing's sitting there when it leaves that's it there won't be another there won't be many more tomorrows after this happens and and there's destruction coming from these things that just wipe things out Atomic fod it it's doing away with everything and the ability to do it is now God doesn't need to send down fire and brimstone we we've got it all to do it all ourselves and these are just ideas of everything we see has got judgment impending upon it everything that we see here next one and it talks about earthquakes there's going to be an earthquake like there was never seen before it's just it's just going to sink continents the islands he says the islands were no more New Zealand's an island it will be no more it's done it it's there's just a it's just gone that's reality that we face and now the bride goes up now I don't know if this fits exactly here but there's a reason why I've put it here and this is don't don't take this as this is where it exactly is but there is another judgment for the believer and it is called the Judgment seat of Christ and it's not the same as the great white Throne judgment I want to show you this next scripture I just want to come in on that just quickly if I can Romans 14:10 says I don't know the the tribulation happened the bride is away at the wedding supper but at some point sometime there is a judgment for the for the bride I know it sounds odd but I want to show you the scriptures but why Dost thou judge thy brother or why Dost thou sit it not thy brother for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and he says for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad now this is not talking about the great white thr in judgment because brother talks about it here he says I don't know when I can be back again it'll only be through the will of God and whatever he shows me to do and I love you and someday I must stand at the Judgment seed of Christ to give an account for the things that we've done in this life if I never meet you no more till I meet you in the land of glory and stand there at the Judgment seat of Christ where we we'll all come I've told you the truth many times he says I'll meet you at that judgment there but that's not it's not the great white Throne judgment you might have missed all these but here's one that you're going to stand that's the conference at judgment there you're all going to be there every one of us is going to stand at the Judgment seat of Christ to give an account for what we've done with Christ and his word sometimes he might say it like the great white Thad judgment but it's different and I want to show you this other quote that he gave next one now Brotherman was talking about when he went beyond the curtain of time so we've heard the story so he goes beyond the curtain of time and he sees all the the the the people there and he says who are all these people people what does this mean and and he said they're your people I said my people there couldn't be that many Brams there's Millions he said they your converts Hallelujah they're your converts they're the ones that said see that one standing there the most beautiful woman I've ever seen he said she was past 90 years old when you led her to God no wonder she's crying my darling brother said she'll never be old no more she's passed from that she's in the Splendor of you she's standing here she can't drink she can't drink a cold drink of water she don't need it she can't lay down and sleep cuz she don't get tired there's no tomorrow no yesterday no nothing we're in eternity now but some Glorious Day the Son of God shall come and you will be judged according to the word that you preach to them and he said and I said will I will Paul have to bring his group now in another one brother B says I want to go and see Jesus and they said you can't go and see him yet you first got to be judged for what you preached right then you can go and see him so there was some I don't know when it is but there was something that we have to go and face and and it's what have we done what did we do cuz if we receive a reward then okay what did you do for your reward I don't know how it works but the Bible talks about it and I don't know is there more or less I don't I don't know all I know is he couldn't go and see Jesus because it says you have to be judged for this first and and whether it fits in that timeline I don't know but when I think about this then it makes me think I want to make sure that my actions everything I do counts for the gospel and when my motives are judged you know I can say you know what Lord I can stand here clean and say my Motors were pure and I may have not got everything right but in that situation may have people may have thought it was that but in my heart I knew it was this this is what I said in that this is what I was thinking in that situation this is that and it makes us more cautious of how we do it to realize well we're not just going to get away scotf free it's all going to come open and and and as brother B said I'll meet you there and I'll give an account for everything I did okay next one now after that after the the tribulation happened that Fier judgments happened and the Earth as ashes then the Bible says that there's a millennium for a thousand years and the righteous walk out on the ashes of the wicked so now that's a thousand- year rest period it's the type of the Sabbath you got 6,000 you've got 1,000 years so now the bride Christ and his bride come back down to the Earth for for a thousand year and it's called the Millennium Reign okay next one cuz I want to show you there's a few more judgments and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless put and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a saell upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till a thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loose for a little season so there's a Thousand-Year period and the Revelation 25 says but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection which is the bride because you know the dead in Christ meet him they rise up that's the first resurrection on such the second death which is a great white Throne judgment ha no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so this is the bride reigning a thousand years and brother Brown says this here and immediately after his days shall the Great Tribulation set in and burn the Earth it's Armageddon everything gets burnt and then at the return of the church and the bride the Bride In Christ shall walk out upon the ashes in the Millennium when the earth is purified by fire and there and there they shall this is interesting and I not going to get into this but this is what brother R says and the heathens that never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time and the sons of God will be manifest a feast rign is got to have something to re over he's got a domain and they ruled and reign with Christ and Christ ruled with the ruled with the rod of iron the Nations so there's this time where we We Rule and Reign for a thousand years called the Millennium that the Thousand Years of the earth okay now next one okay the scriptures talk about that the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the Young Lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them there's going to be things here so I don't know how it works but we don't know how the Earth was made either you know so God's got a way of doing things there's going to be animals there's going to be things here there'll be there'll be kingdoms to rule and rign over and things to do in this Millennium time it is going to happen next one now at the end of a thousand years there's there's this final battle that they call the Battle of Gog the Bible talks about the Battle of Gog and Magog okay it says after a thousand years that Satan's loosed back and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the Nations which were in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is the sand of the sea and went upon up on the bread of the earth and compassed the camp of the Saints about and the Beloved City and fire came down from heaven fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them so when he's Loos it's like they just he he gets in them all again and they all come against the the the the camp of God now this time here God just says his own fire came down and just destroyed them this the Battle of Gog and Magog and it's not Armageddon it's a different one now that pretty much wipes out all living after that everything living is gone and in this earth as we know it finished done next one there's a lot of judgment going to happen that was Gog and Magog now the next one we have is the great white Throne judgment just and this is the last judgment next one now after that it says and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up her dead remember that word sea and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their Works remember brother B said we looked at the other passages now blessed are the merciful they shall obtain Mercy all these people people are going to turn up here to be judged and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death I was supposed to delete that read that later on but and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire next one now I don't know if I got I beheld I just want to say this here the Bible says know ye not that the Saints shall judge the Earth okay the Saints the the bride isn't being judged at this one the bride brother man talks about the bride is is the one that judges Earth sits as a Queen of Heaven judges the Earth you wonder why we go through these judgments here we've got to know how to judge the the bride doesn't get judged here now Daniel says I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his whals as Bur burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousands thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 time 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set the books were open so you've got the smaller group ministering with him which is his bride then you've got 10,000 time 10,000 stood before him which was the sea that gave up a did everything just everything else stood before him but the bride stood with him okay next one oh here we go do ye not know that the saint shall judge the world this is not just something that is a little passage this is what happens here the bride shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters next one Jesus talked about the queen of the South and he said the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and Behold a greater than Solomon is here brother BR gave this example to say I think it was him to say or maybe it was just in discussion to say that the people from your generation you'll judge so he says because the queen of she was from that sort of time so she'll come up and judge these people because she was like she could say I was there I went through that this is how I this is what I did what was your excuse you know and and and our generation will come up before us cuz we can say I was I lived in Wellington you're from Wellington I was there there you're from New Zealand you from South Africa I was there that's the way it will work next one but this is a great and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left remember the five we went through this is when the the Bible talks about the the death and Hell gave up their dead then it talks about the sea gave up their dead these some people didn't come from death death and hell some people came from this place the Bible calls to see I don't know is that these other people that actually they're waiting for their judgment and they will actually make it in but they're not from death and hell but but what is sure is people will receive a righteous judgment here and there will be those the five types different types will come will stand here and that's what I was saying before that one thing that someone did for you and you said Lord I really appreciate this that could be it for them that could be it the the remnant that went through tribulation that that had to die for all that that that they come there and they they've been purified they that that was it for them they they they stood with the Lord and what they knew and they made it through think about it the Lord has got the right to save who he wants to because he paid the own price so he can say you're in you're out he paid his own price so he can do what he wants to do so it's not unjust to say you're in because I've chosen to forgive you you understand stand he can do what he wants to do but the goats death and Hell everything this is the final point where where everything evil every every bit of sin everything evil is just going to be finished done this is his final judgment the Lord spent a lot of time with judgment implementing judgment all the way through he's put a lot of effort implementing judgment a lot of effort go to the next one and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire that's just the end of it no more no more next one now the last one I've got here is peace and it's an amazing word to think and that's why I use the scripture the Prince of Peace because at some point you look at all the effort the the the fight that God has had to wage and the judgment and things he's had to do I don't believe God enjoys that I don't believe he does the way he created man was I'll create Adam and Eve and I'll just it'll be a peaceful existence and I'll come down and fellowship with you we'll live in peace that was his ideal idea of how he wanted to do things but because things went the way they did he had he's had to fight this battle all the way through and Implement all this judgment who likes implementing judgment I don't I can't stand it sometimes I have to do it to my children I think I I I can't wait till this is over cuz I don't enjoy this I think God is the same he doesn't sit there and think I want to get rid of all this I want to implement my judgment and that but he'll do it because he has to but he it wasn't his desire his desire was to have peace go to the next one and I I I got this picture because it really spoke to me I thought you know one day even the Lord's going to sit back and think I can to have peace it's it's all done I can just be with my bride and those that I've redeemed and I don't have to do this I don't have to I don't have to for me any more judgment it's done he's a prince of peace that the and I can just dwell here in this place with my bride and with all with my my kingdom and I don't have to it's all over I think even he'll sit back and go it's done because he's fought a major battle against evil and to get us out of it he's fought a major battle and I'm so glad that one day there's a song that says there will be peace in the valley for me someday there will be peace in the valley for me till that day comes we'll fight with everything we've got but I can't wait to have to be in a place of peace and to be with the Prince of Peace amen let's just pray this evening we ask the musicians um if they can come Lord Jesus we just humbly come to you again this afternoon Lord and we thank you so much Lord that when we heard your voice Lord there was something us to receive it and Lord those of us that have walked with you for a while we our testimony is Lord it gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by lord it's just a it's a privilege to serve you and even to Lord we we accept the good things of you but even when we receive correction from you lord it's that in itself Lord that the Bible says it Bears the peble fruits of righteousness and we see that in our own lives Lord when we there's times when Lord we we go strand you you have to correct us Lord but it it makes us more like you and we're so grateful for your faithfulness Lord that you you Lord sometimes we as parents are lazy and we we don't we can't be be bothered putting the effort into Implement correction and then maybe that
