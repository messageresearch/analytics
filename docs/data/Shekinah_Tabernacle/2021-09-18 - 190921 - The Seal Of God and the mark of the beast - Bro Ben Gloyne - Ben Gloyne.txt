christian be sad how can a christian fail to smile in the house of the lord it's all right if you don't want to smile outside that's your business but in the house of god [Music] don't let the devil see you without a smile on your face because the moment you move out there it says this one here attack this one wasn't happy go for that one that's how the animal is in the jungle if a lion is looking they're looking at the head of buffalo right rambo the lions are hunting they are hungry they are looking for food so they are not just going to attack they look oh you can't attack that bull there he's too strong he'll kill you but which are the weak ones here oh those ones there so the others are going this way this one is just behind you know then they attack that one so in the house of god we are an army of god we smile all the time even when you don't have money in your pocket smile smile then the devil will think maybe he's got he's got a secret account we don't know about an overseas account somewhere that we don't know about why is he smiling i thought this guy doesn't have a job but he's smiling i think there's no food in the house why is he smiling so keep smiling keep smiling the house of god then the devil will say i don't know what to do with this one who might as well let him go so we don't believe in sad christians [Music] that one i don't know about i'm trying to figure that one out in the house of god we are happy we smile in the house of god why because jesus set us absolutely free sister when you are in the kitchen there is no food in the house the husband is not working just say jesus said us absolutely free title calvary he gave me liberty jesus set us absolutely free we're gonna praise his hope then that way the devil can't touch us we are saying go by everybody [Music] oh me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] and [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] he touched me [Music] me [Music] the end of jesus [Music] oh he touched me [Music] the joy that floods my soul oh something wonderful happened and now i know he touched me and made me holy hallelujah hallelujah amen is that your testimony this morning he touched me and made me whole i'm no longer shackled by a heavy burden of sin hallelujah amen thank you musicians thank you brother auntis amen praise the lord great to be in the house of the lord today amen hallelujah amen praise our god amen amen praise the lord i trust you've all been having a good week um i trust you've been streaming the youth without border services being real blessed amen praise the lord so the last one is at 6 00 pm tonight so i encourage you all to connect to that amen praise the lord we've been having a good time at home so amen let's just turn to the scripture i have a power point there um i mean i want to here we go so let's just see if i can drive okay i can drive so we're gonna go first thessalonians 5 and 1. now this scripture is directly after first thessalonians 4 which is the the rapture scripture you know the lord himself shall descend with a shout the voice the archangel the trump of god and uh we know that when the apostle paul wrote the gospels or i mean the epistles rather he didn't put chapter and verse in so so first thessalonians 5 is a continuation of first thessalonians 4. right so so the apostle paul is saying here but of the times and seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that that day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night so when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon him as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness he's talking about you right that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day yeah not of the night nor of darkness amen therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for at helmet the hope of salvation for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning if you have a knee just want to raise your hands to the lord amen gracious heavenly father once again we just want to praise your mighty name lord we can truly sing with such a thanksgiving our hearts jesus has set me absolutely free lord we want to thank you for that dear god thank you that we have a real liberty in you lord jesus there's no sin nothing that the devil can tack upon us because your blood has loosed us from all those things father we praise your mighty name dear god i just want to ask lord as we have read your word your sacred holy word i pray you'd anoint it dear god to speaker and hear our lord may you just come and live among us oh god lord may yours may the spirit of revelation which you are lord illuminate our souls lord may you raise our faith oh god lord may you cast down every evil imagination lord every work of darkness father we thank you lord that they do not belong to us but there but they belong to the devil so by the blood of jesus christ we send back his works and all of his unbelief back to him in the name of jesus christ and father i pray lord you just lord just encourage us along the way father may our hearts burn within us lord may we walk out of these doors change and renewed and transformed made more like you grant it for your glory we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning um so i want to actually talk about the seal of god and the mark of the beast today because i've received a lot of videos and emails and people asking questions is it the vaccine what is it that all these questions and and it's it's family not family believer not believer so you know there's a lot of there's a lot of voices in this end time but we received a vindicated message in this end time through a vindicated prophet god over vindicated his ministry amen the son of man was revealed and so we've heard the voice of god in this day and so it really uh you know it behooves us to stay in line with the word of god i mean so we've read here that you know we are not the children of darkness right we're not the children of darkness it's very dark in the world but in the bride it's very light right it's very light we're living in a very bright place hallelujah our spiritual condition is very bright i mean so we are not wait did i do that no here we go you know so so this day with the you know so the translation of the dead and living saints to be with the lord is not going to overtake the bride as a thief in the night the lord will come as like a thief in the night but it's not going to come and pass us by and we're going to miss it right if you have the seal of god hallelujah you should be the most happiest person in all the world irrespective of your of of of trials struggles questions hardship financial spiritual whatever it may be that's going on mind battles whatever it is if you're really sealed in by the baptism the holy ghost that you just make you shout i'm irrespective of what's going on in here what's going on around you family work whatever it may be amen we can rejoice because we've been sealed in amen hallelujah so we are not the children of darkness i mean they either are you know in the night they're drunk and they sleep you know this world is drunk it's staggering it's staggering to and fro opinion and things going on spirits moving and everything that's happening in the world today is god fulfilling his word and we may see it as very natural things but it's god fulfilling his word you know it's the same when you know you think naturally how unfair it was for joseph to have to take mary she's about to give birth to jesus but because of a decree of a of a of an ungodly emperor that everyone had to return to the place without born to be taxed i mean he had to put mary on the on on the donkey and had to take her to bethlehem now naturally you think that's just the oppressive government and everything's going wrong no it's not it's god fulfilling his word i mean because he had to be born in bethlehem right he was going to be born in nazareth but the scripture could not be broken so god allowed that to happen for her for them to move to bethlehem for jesus to be born to fulfill scripture see everything we see around us is fulfillment of scripture but if you see it through the eyes of our absolute right you will see it for what it is but if you see it through human understanding well you just be staggering around but we are not drunk like the world hallelujah we are spiritually sober and alert and we have a clear head hallelujah for god has not appointed us to wrath i like to say god has not appointed me to wrath make it personal now but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ hallelujah now a couple of uh sundays ago i was i was preaching and then part of it was from the script from the message modern events are made clear by prophecy and uh part of that where brother braham goes and he speaks about micah standing before king ahab king jehoshaphat before they go to the battle and now the thing is so so here's here's micro in this picture i just thought for the children you know picture tells a thousand words you know and so so here is here is zedekiah who's the head of the ministerial association remember those 400 hebrew prophets were prophesying that that ahab and jehoshaphat should go and fight take ramath gilead they're all enthused they're all excited i mean the head of the ministerial association the head of the council of churches made some iron horns and you said by this you'll push out the syrians you'll take the land and you know jehoshaphat here he's thinking because he's a godly king he's thinking but but ahab do you not have one more prophet you know you think 400 is enough but 401 seems to be better because there's enough of god in him to say well you know the scripture says something but you're saying something else and how's this all working out and and then so michael here he wasn't part of the council he wasn't in this denominational grouping here and you know they went and got him and you know ahab didn't want to get him to begin with because he said well there's one other but he hates me he prophesies against me and but how could he say anything but because he had received a vindicated amen prophecy from elijah that ahab was going to die jezebel was going to die and so all the events had to fulfill that everything had to come together for the fulfillment of his destruction right so so he you know he was told before he came to this great big meeting say what everyone else is saying we're having a great you know great great convention everyone's shouting and enthused and yeah we really feel the anointing yeah they are anointed but it was by a lying spirit but because they didn't take the inspiration back into the scripture i mean the devil could just have his free reign and then so he came before the king and he said yo go up you're the lord's with you and he was being a bit sarcastic about it because the king said didn't he say didn't i tell you why he's prophesized you're evil against me and he said you know i saw israel scattered like sheep without a shepherd you know and then zedekiah got you know gets all offended so when did the spirit of god leave me and go to you you know slaps him in the face and you know and then and then and then makai yeah micah says you know i i was praying about this last night and i saw a vision of heaven and there was a god was having a meeting up in heaven saying what could how can i get ahab to fall in battle to fulfill the words of elijah my prophet hallelujah and then a lying spirit came up from hell and said i'll get into those prophets because they're not standing on my word they're standing on public opinion they're standing on social trends and what's trending in social media and different opinions and you know videos and stuff i'll get into them and i'll make him fulfill the words of elijah if you go read this go read the story it's actually ahab has the idea to take remote gilead so he brings himself to his own destruction man always destroys himself this is very important principle i mean but but mikey here he couldn't say anything about what the scripture said and this is and to me brother brahma is saying this is this is the believer in the end time this is the bride of christ in the end time she will stay with us saith the lord she won't move from that thus saith the lord it doesn't matter you know i've had i had an email from a brother in india and he sent me this big long email some other people wrote meant to be believers and they take quotes and they and they by conjecture they string them together and they say look brother brahm said the vaccine's the mark of the beast he doesn't say it at all but it's by conjecture you know people take things and they try and extrapolate it's oh it must be in this and this is going to happen but it's not even in the word it's not even in the message and if they were only spiritual minded they say no no this is a lying spirit this is to get people's attention off really what's important and what is important in this hour is the going home of the bride that is the next big event on the calendar is us the dead in christ rising you know there's going to be a time when the dead in christ going to walk through these doors or they'll walk into your house hallelujah you may be driving in the car they'll sit in the passenger seat next you start talking to you holly and you'll realize who they are amen hallelujah you know there's going to be about 40 days where we're going to gather what kind of church services will be like that hallelujah when the dead and christ are rising and we're shouting and rejoicing because we're knowing we're going to hallelujah we've actually amen all the trials of life are over cause it's done it could be this morning why not amen it's in an hour that the world doesn't look for he steps in and takes her away holly but we're looking for that hour away because we're being sealed by the spirit of god i mean there's an expectation in our souls come quickly lord hallelujah amen so i want to be a micah i want to stick with a vindicated message hallelujah that's what we've got to do amen now brother ram says here here we are in time red light down flashing coming of the lord is at hand yes sir listen entire message should meet end time conditions where where where they've got off where they've got off i haven't got off i've stayed on right i've stayed on with the word some people get off i'm not getting off this boat hallelujah the message ought to bring it back always end time message meets end time conditions so the end time message meets to 2021 right brother brown knew exactly what he was saying it didn't you know he didn't re you know he knew exactly what we'd be facing today right end time message meets end time always it meets end time conditions right so the word of god we have received meets the condition of the end time amen now he says in the last days what's going to take to stand as a scriptural trained church on the line that's what we need to be a scripturally trained church because if we're scripturally trained we won't get off the line right we won't get caught up in every wind of doctrine and conjecture of man right and so that's why if we can see what the mark of the beast is in the scripture right then we won't be deceived by anything that's going on right for there's going to be carnal impersonations rise the bible said as janice and james generous withstood moses so will these men have reprobate mind concerning the truth and jesus was the truth thy word is the truth because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the word of god is more powerful than a two-edged sword cutting to asunder of the bone and a discern of the thoughts of the heart we realize that we're in that day to where anything can look so real but yet if it's off the scripture leave it alone it could look so real why do you think people fall for things because it looks so real but if it's off the scripture leave it alone right so it can look so real but leave it alone no matter what kind of a sensation what results you find out of it if it isn't scripture stay away from it stay right with the word yeah amen amen now here we have in genesis 4 we have the first account of the mark of the beast because the mark of the beast has been here since time began it's always been here it's a spiritual mark right people say oh there's going to be a physical mark as well no it's already manifesting i'll show you what it is it's not a tattoo it's not a microchip it's not a vaccine it's already here and the physical manifestation is already here brother brahmary told us what the physical manifestation is okay so genesis 4 and 1 and adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear cane and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of the sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass it came brought of the fruit of the grounded offering unto the lord and abel he also brought her the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect under abel and to his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell so here's the first worship that's recorded in scripture they're both believers cain was not an unbeliever he was a real believer he knew you know he knew that there was a fall he knew that there was a gulf between god and man he knew there was a sacrifice that needed to be given but we know that it was by intellectual understanding he he presented fruit but but but abel by revelation knew it was blood so they're both they're both religious they're both worshiping one is accepted and one is rejected and cain was mad about it what did we read that last and the lord said unto cain why art thou wrath and why is thou countenance fallen if thou doest well thou shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lies at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him and cain so he said just do like your your brother did and you'll be accepted you saw your brother was accepted just do what he did and you'll be accepted but now and cain talked with us talked with abel his brother and it came to pass that when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him so god god presented the truth to cain and cain rejected it and in that rejection he murdered the true believer and we know on this day murder is not just physical murder you can kill someone's um you know you can kill them by by slander lies malice whatever it may be false you can murder someone's reputation that was the word i was looking for i mean so and the lord said unto cain where's abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and now thou art cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tilt us to ground it shall not henceforth yield unto her unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shall there be in the earth and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from my face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord said a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of not on the east of eden so here's the here's the process truth is presented but then truth is rejected and then and then what happens is cain is marked by god and then he leaves the presence of god and this is the effect of the mark of the beast truth is turned down for the last time murder takes place of the true believer right then god marks the person and the evidence of him being marked as they go out of the presence of the lord they can be religious cain's line was very religious but this is the first time when someone's marked and left out we're now the prince of god because they turned down the truth this is the pattern right amen now if we jump all the way back to revelations 13 well all the way forward to revelations 13 it says and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark on their right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 603 score and 6. now if we go back to here to kane cain was not willing to surrender to the word right so it's an apostate mark right it's those who are not willing to subject themselves to the word of god receive the mark of the beast there's only two groups brother braham says in the end time those that have the seal of god and those that have the mark of the beast two groups right so cain was not willing to surrender himself to the word because the lord himself spoke to him just do like your brother did you'll be accepted it's not hard you don't even really need to understand what you're doing just take me at my word you saw what happened with abel he was accepted you ought to be accepted do what he did but he wasn't willing to surrender himself to the word so it's in a mark of apostasy and so now this word beast here in that's that's used here in revelations this is the strong concordance it means a dangerous animal a venomous wild beast so it's something that is untameable something's wild and it's actually a manifestation right what you see people that's why i say well there's got to be a physical uh mark well you see how people are and you'll see a physical manifestation of a mark untameable to the scripture untamable to the word religious as you're following me religious as can be but actually their life is manifesting if they've been marked or seek because we're reflecting either one and you either take one or the other you can't have both you can't have the seal of god then take the mark of the beast and you can't have the mark of the beast and take the seal of god right we all want the seal of god amen so it's something that's untamable untenable to what the word amen he says don't you see now we know the devil's religious right that was his ambition in isaiah says i'll be like the i'll be like the most high i want to exalt myself by the stars of god yeah i'm going to be like the most high what is the most high he's god he's an object of worship satan wanted to be an object of worship too and in this evil age he is he says don't you see how religious the devil is the the devil is not he's not anti great big thing like communism all against christianity that's not oh well sure i mean uh that's of oh well of the devil's sure but it's not the antichrist so communism is against god sure it's the devil doing but it's not it's not the antichrist right the antichrist is very religious very religious it was a religious spirit that crucified jesus it wasn't the prostitute it wasn't the drunkard it wasn't the indifferent it was the religious spirits that crucified our lord see it's it was a very it was a religious spirit that crucified jesus it's always been a religious world a religious people that crucifies it's the religious people that was against the true christ it was the religious prophets that was against micaiah it's the religious people of the day that's against the message of god and there are and and so this is going back to revelation 13 and this is the greek word then the strongs and and and therion is wild untamed savages in other words if you watch the 11th chapter the beast of rome the uh the 13th chapter the the united states the 17th chapter both united states and rome of the denominational churches cons cons consolidated thank you with catholicism makes them an unconverted untamed to the gospel he says untamed bless god we come from the big methodist church the baptist the presbyterian the pentecostal denominations we know what we're talking about nobody leads is going to tell us no one's going to tell us they always say we're not led by a man we're not following a man i'm not following a man either well actually i am the man christ jesus his word right brother ram says that the bride is following jesus christ the word i remember they say on no one's no man's leading us and they have their councils they have their assemblies they have their bishop they have their pope they have their presbyter they have the one they have their headquarters and they say they're not following anyone uh no they are right but it's so it makes an unconverted untamed to the gospel untamed bless god we come from the big methodist church the baptist of presbyterian the pentecostal denomination we know what we're what we're talking nobody leads is going to tell us there you are untamed unconverted without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are good what is that that's a physical manifestation of the mark of the beast not a microchip not a tattoo not a vaccine vaccine it is a spiritual mark are we all together you say what about the people there's good people in there i pray they come out there's been a cry in this end time come out of her my people which is not just catholicism it's all of denomination because she is the mother of harlots why does she birth harlot denominational systems so it's not just it's not just catholicism it's all of organized christianity you know when i first read the church age book i thought why is brother bram so against organized religion because i thought that's the only one there is and the reason is it's man controlled it's demon inspired why because it holds people back from the full word of god that holds them back from a true walks brother brahm said one thing that i want to see established and i'll be satisfied this is what he wanted a true spiritual relationship between god and man he did not say a true spiritual relationship between me god and people as me's in between no he wanted a true spiritual relationship between god and man that's what he wanted to see established and this is what this church stands for as this is what i want to see is a true spiritual relationship between god and man that none of us serve god through someone else we don't serve god because of our parents we don't serve god through our parents or our brother our sister through the preacher through the past that god forbid i mean but we serve god because it's us and him walking together amen that's how it's got to be so amen untamed to the gospel so when you see people who are not willing now it could be them under conviction whatever but you know we can't put people in a box but to me this is the manifestation of the mark of the beast they will keep their church their church says i stick with my church that's it now in exodus 21 now these are the judgments which thou shall set before them if thou by a hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing and if he come in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his master has given him a wife and she has borne him sons or daughters the wife and the children shall be her masters and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife my children i will no go um i will not go out free then his master shall bring him into unto the judges and he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his air through with an all and he shall serve him forever so there's a every sin you know the jubilee year and and and this slave hebrew slave could decide i'm going to go free and if they're if they decide to go free they could go free but if they decided no i love my master you know i'm not you know i want to stay like this then they were born through with an all through the air and that signified they could never go free and what does the air signify hearing so they could it didn't matter how long they lived after this they could never go through they could hear the jubilee trumpet they could hear it time and time again but because they are bored through with with an all through the air they could never ever go free was that there's a mark of the beast they can't hear the gospel no more thus they exactly in the same condition they're in lord help this world and then it's the same thing there but we know that in in ezekiel uh in ezekiel 9 there's the seal of god is shown as a mark as well i don't have it on here but before the great slaughtering in jerusalem would happen he says that a young angel with an incorn would go through the city and and and mark those who would sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city and that yeah the prophet says we should sign cry for the abomination has done all the sin and everything that's done but at the same time we should have such joy and praise god so much hallelujah because he set us absolutely free amen so there's a marking as well amen by by the holy ghost himself and we're living in an hour where there's not going to be destruction of a city but a world right a great tribulation is coming brother am said that the world war ii was an amateur tribulation and you go and look at what happened you just go look in europe you know go look just go look around the world where that conflict happened i don't want to be stuck here when that's going on and that's amateur that's just amateur what about when it's for real life if i can put it that way but god has given us the ability to receive the seal of god the holy ghost that we don't have to go there hallelujah i'm so glad about that hallelujah now some and so what what does allow me about all these things is people say you know that that the vaccine is a step towards the mark of the beast so i'm showing you from the scripture we want to be scriptural trained that is not a step and it's not it right the step is this and now we know what withholders that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity to authority work only he who now letteth will let till he be taken out of the way so the mystery of iniquity is working but he who now letteth will let that's the holy ghost is actually keeping keeping things down i mean just like the anointing the mighty angel descends puts his foot on the land and the sea his pillars of fire keeps keeps the powers of darkness down why until the bride is gathered to himself and then when he lifts off i mean when the when the holy ghost leaves the gentiles we're going with because we're part of him we're part of the word right so that's when hell will be fully we know hell's unleashed but that's supposed to be totally unleashed now don't despair in these things because we have a way of escape and we have something to give people we have the true living god that we can give people that's why i should pray god give us wisdom help us lord that we could speak a word in season amen that people's hearts would be soft and you would be sensitive that we could just just even a phrase amen you know we want everyone to come in i don't want to see you anyone left behind even your worst enemy would you like your worst enemy stuck here if you do there's something wrong with you you need to come here and pray amen now and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceive deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth see this is actually this is this is actually the stepping stone to be marked with the mark of the beast is because people do not receive a love of the truth it doesn't say they don't receive pardon me the truth they don't receive a love for it that's why it's got to be in our hearts may we love the truth may we love this word may we love him because he is the way the truth it doesn't say a truth the truth the truth is jesus christ the resurrected lord of glory so it's not they didn't receive i i received him as my personal savior but did they receive a love for the truth because if they really did that i'd go all the way into the baptism of the holy ghost that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie and that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness this is the apostle paul this is speaking of today we want to receive a love for the truth and we don't want to be a stumbling block to others we want to be salty amen but you see because they don't receive a love for the truth then god sends a strong delusion that they should believe a lie so what happens people rarely begin to rally around the wrong thing there is one thing to write there's one person to rally around it's not biden it's not trump it's not vaccines or no vaccine it's not conspiracy theory it's not youtube it's not instagram it's not tick-tock it's not facebook it's not your phone it's not the news it's not public opinion that is we're not called to rally around those things but we're called a rally around the lord jesus christ amen the living word of the you know the prophet said if america just received the gift that was in her midst which was the baptism of the holy ghost the genuine one they would have they'd have like a millennium condition i mean all their enemies would have feared them he said that that that one holy ghost filled camp meeting is worth more to a country than than like a hundred atomic bombs why because of god's moving in a people it actually pushes the powers of darkness back i mean that the enemy can't do what he wants to do i mean that's why we cannot let down the buzz just conform to a word and not have the spark the dynamics living in our lives we must have god manifesting this word in us hallelujah amen we can't just let religious spirits infiltrate and make us lukewarm formal and powerless no but we're here that god would come in and not just infiltrate but we let we open the door say come and lord jesus take over my life amen hallelujah transforms us and makes us like him amen so we can just turn this around because they receive the love for the truth they are saved and for this cause god took them into rapture amen amen hallelujah hey isn't the lord good remember we're not the children of darkness we're children of the light we can see where we're going we see where we came from we're going from eternity we're going back to eternity amen we see what the devil's doing that's why you know if you really want to just pour unbelief in your life sit on social media if you want to have a double-minded way just sit on social media it's guaranteed if you want faith to come and put the message on amen read your bible pray every day as brother edward saying to the young people hallelujah amen and make sure that your relationship is between you and god amen hallelujah it's just the devil that makes makes you think the word is boring amen and if you feel that way you say lord put a love put a fire put a passion end me for your word amen now jesus would say in a parable we won't read the whole parable but he says in luke 19 11 and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear and he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come but this but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us now that he he's laying out this parable he's actually prophesying he's saying this is what's going to happen they're going to hate me because i'm the king right i'm the king in this parable i'm going to give my servants talents i'm going to give them gifts it can be preaching it can be exhortation it can be singing it can be song writing can be prayer helps governments teaching evangelism whatever it is you know but everyone has a gift hallelujah i'm actually looking i believe at the most gifted people on the face of the earth the bride of jesus christ amen and we want to take our talents which is our gifts he's when he talks about talents he's not talking about stewardship of money he's talking about stewardship of gifts that god's given you right people say oh no you're gonna be financially accountable sure you should be but this is not what this is talking about this is talking about the gift in your life are you putting it into use amen right but the one no we don't um i don't have it here but the one who just buried his talent he was afraid that the king would get mad at him if he made a mistake no no step out in faith our god our god has given us a talent each it can be five ten one hey even if i've i've got one i want to put it into action highly i'm gonna put it into action for his glory amen because he's coming back for me hallelujah but so he's saying that these so the citizens are saying we will not have this man to reign over us and who is this man the word why do they say when he's standing before pilate pilate asks him should we lease should i release barabbas or this jesus of nazareth and they said give us barabbas imagine what just went through us you'd be shocked wouldn't you brabus is a murderer horrible man come on he's condemned to die because of what he did here's jesus of nazareth just being scourged crown of thorns on his head standing there never did anything wrong in his life and he's expecting that jesus will be released because that makes sense one hand a murderer the other one raised the dead he did every funeral he went to it didn't stay a funeral healed the sick raise the dead cast out devils he's the same jesus today gave eternal life but they say give us barabbas basically they're saying we will not have this man reign over us now as i said in the beginning about ahab ahab if you read that account brought destruction upon himself and christ rejecting men or christ rejecting nation or a christ-rejecting world brings judgment upon itself i want just keep that in mind very i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation o jerusalem jerusalem thou that kill us the prophets and stone of them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings but ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate for i sent you ye shall not see me henceforth till he shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down this was prophesied to happen and remember jesus was led by vision so maybe he saw the destruction when he's looking at the temple and things now this all happened because of christ rejecting men we will not have this man rule over us what they do truth was presented but they turned down truth and they crucified truth what happens a mark of the beast falls now now this is just a painting of the destruction of of jerusalem when jesus said that not one stone will be left upon another nothing could stop this from happening ahab the prophecy of elijah said ahab was going to die nothing could stop it from happening because ahab didn't fully repent he was a bit tender and soft and careful for a bit but then he just went back into his old ways and it had to be fulfilled so everything all the events of those days was bringing ahab's destruction all the events that led to this was bringing its destruction all the you know the zealots rising up and they you know hated the romans they wanted to cast them off and political factions and all these things going on it was all because of christ rejecting men were stirred up to destroy now if you were a believer in that day there would have been a lot of pressure are you for us are you against the romans what side are you on you're a jew make a step we're jews too don't you want the don't you want jerusalem to be free again don't you want the romans to be kicked out look at all the pressure they put on us reading the news all these things going on taxation and hardship and things and you know there'd be a lot of pressure but a real believer would say no hold on my god told me this is going to be destroyed and when and and he said pray that your your flight when this happened when when jerusalem's um compassed about with armies pray that your flight is not on the sabbath day why because the gates were shut on the sabbath day you know titus besieged jerusalem three times on the third time he took it and destroyed it the first two times he had to withdraw to take care of other enemies so no doubt when when when titus came the first time then he left all the real believers will say hey the lord said about this let's get out holy they would have fled for their lives and they weren't caught in the destruction because they obeyed the voice of god i mean they the seal of god i mean that quickened that word to their souls that when prophecy was being fulfilled they ran for their lives and they weren't caught in the destruction it's the same thing today friends if you have the seal of god the baptism of the holy ghost you won't be caught in the destruction of the world you won't be here for the great tribulation you'll be on streets of gold amen you'll be down around the wedding supper table i've been having the feast hallelujah amen why are you talking about the destruction of jerusalem and the mark of the beast and so on because there's a lot of events taking place and they are sad events they are tragic events but we can't get caught up in them brother bam said this the last and seventh vision was there and i heard a most terrible explosion and as i turned to look i saw nothing but deborah's and craters and smoke all over the land of america how many of these visions have been fulfilled quite a lot i mean they've been fulfilled exactly as he saw them now unfortunately this has to happen we don't like it i don't want to see destroy i don't want to see people i don't want to see california go in it's prophesied it's going to happen right even in revelations 18. there's two babylons one is burnt up the other's like a millstone cast into the water god what is that that's la sliding in i don't there'll be millions of people die you think about the catastrophe it won't just be an isolated you know you're the earthquake in haiti that's happened hundreds have died you know thousands die here and different things it'll be on a grand scale do you think we're going to be saying hallelujah glory to god i'm so glad those people went into that no we won't because they are people like you and i but they have a choice if anyone is sincere and generally want to find god god will come across their path they can be in the back of afghanistan somewhere they can be in some muslim they can be in mecca and saudi arabia if they have a genuine burden i want to meet god then the lord jesus christ will come by their way god is obligated to a sincere heart it's the same thing with you and if we have a genuine longing lord i want to know you i really want to know you lord i just want to i don't want to hear about you only i want to know you god will meet you god will meet that kind of a heart so all of the events we have we are seeing is stepping stones to the fulfillment of this when george floyd was murdered like he was those horrible things happened that was a stepping stone for the destruction of america whether we like it all remember rome wasn't built in a day it wasn't destroyed in a day either but it's a lot quicker to destroy something to build something but if you go look at you know a lot of historians have studied the fall of the roman empire and it was stepping stone upon stepping stone upon stepping stone because there's a scripture that the beast would receive a deadly womb it would be healed it turned from pagan rome to papal rome it's just a phrase in the scripture but there's a lot of events that cause that to happen right and if we were living there maybe we were even christians that were living in rome genuine ones you know we see our see our country go down we'd probably be feeling bit sad about it maybe i don't know might be wrong but you know no one likes to see destruction especially a christian we want to see life amen we want to see life so the murder of george floyd the black lives matter movement all those things it was horrible how he died but it was a stepping stone for this the travesty of the withdrawal from afghanistan it's horrible seeing that footage of that although of that globe master cargo plane fly off and people are hanging onto the sides and trying to get out falling to their death that's horrible it's all part of this it is you've got to look remember we're maybe a scriptural trained church see everything we see amen we should see it through the lens of prophecy it doesn't mean we're indifferent to it i'm sad for those people amen you know and and and even the condition of this country we're not exempt oh we're an island far away in the pacific don't be naive this country is going to get it too christ rejecting nations they receive judgment but the elect is sealed away and taken away before that ever happens i mean so we can't get but but the media and everything wants to bombard us with these things look at what's happening and it causes us to have an effect upon us oh there's a you know we can look at the injustice and get caught up in that or this is wrong and the country should do this and this is going on don't get caught up in it does it build faith no is the correct answer if you want it it doesn't build faith does it actually make us more like the lord no it makes us carnally minded that's why we have to be able to walk through this world but not be tainted by this world amen the baptism of the holy ghost is here to allow us to walk through this world amen and not be tainted by it and to be a living witness that people can be caught up in that stuff and we can pull them hallelujah so there's a better way there's a better way than being caught up in all this stuff people protesting about lockdowns and vaccines and so on the vaccine is not the mark of the beast it's not a stepping stone to the mark of the beast the bible's clearly i've i'm trust i've showed you it's clearly the mark of the beast is a mark of apostasy amen and the physical manifestation of it to me is people who are unwilling to be tamed to the scripture they cannot be because their nature within them is an untamable creature he says now you say brother brown why do you strike at those people so hard it ought to be struck at it's got to be struck at flee it because it will finally form the mark of the beast remember that will that is the truth it will be the mark of the beast the nomination will lead right to it it's on its road right here now to to force by power look at look in the old roman empire that's exactly what led them to the mark of the of an apostasy we found out that no man could buy or sell without the mark of the beast he had to have it look at the old roman empire that's exactly what led them wait sorry i've already okay we've got our next paragraph there is only two classes of people will be on the earth those with the seal of god and those with the mark of the beast you say what about the foolish virgin they think they have the seal of god right because they they had no oil when the bridegroom came but they were virgin clean living to the word i don't want to be one of them let's not be foolish just be wise let's be wise in this hour lord give us wisdom fill our lamps with oil may we have a revival every day may he be fresh and wonderful every day may never get cold may never become indifferent you know you know brother john anders was preaching about heart surgery yesterday anything about blockages in the heart and i was actually i think i was talking to analysts when we're driving we're uh we're gonna go pick up a friend or something yeah yeah for lunch and and i said you know you know how you can spiritually feel your heart's getting blocked you become cool and indifferent should say lord undo the blockages in my spirit amen now only two classes yeah only two classes so you'll have to have one or the other will be an apostasy a mark of religion apostate religion and it's going to have an image unto the beast as we study we find out that rome was and as always to be the beast exactly there is no way to get it anything else rome and what did rome do was converted from pagan rome unto papal rome and organized a system a universal system that forced everybody to that one religion or be put to death and it's a strange thing that this united states appears on the scene and it's like a lamb and a lamb has two small horns civil and ecclesiastical rights and after a while when that was a lamb we found out that it spoke then like a dragon now this is revelation 13 if you're wondering and exercised all the power that the dragon had before it and the bible tells us that they said let us make an image unto the beast an image is something like something else and we can see it right um we can see it right now that it's an apostate condition the church is forming the world council of churches which is the image to the power of rome and will force upon the people the same thing that the pagan or papal rome did so there is no other way no other thing but that is the truth and that's why i'm striking it in my age in my time because it's got to be struck at the call coming to come out of her my people that ye be not partaker of her sins amen it says here come out of her this is in revelation 18 4. i'll just read it i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partaker of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues hallelujah we've heard the call come out here we are we've come out amen hallelujah now there's a there's a concern about well if there's no man can buy or sell does that mean we're going to be put out to one side and we won't be able to buy or sell well let's have a look and his church stands alone she is not hooked up with nothing now notice when he's talking about this he's talking about the body of christ around the world right the church what is the church it's not shekinah tabernacle four walls address registered with the charities commission that's not the church the church is a body of believers that god dwells in right that is the church that's the redeemed because remember when the rapture happens this building's staying here this pulpit's going to stay here my bible's going to stay here the message books will stay here he's going to take living people who are filled with him amen when he amy is going to take people who are made in his image now and his church stands alone she is not hooked up with nothing but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil's howling these great organizations just set up something to close her up now the reason i said about the church being the body is because sure these church doors could shut but the body will still function amen we can still preach we can still you know we can still minister we can still function as a body amen because this really what we're doing right now is the smallest part of our body functioning right amen they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up amen they may try but they'll never do it i stand by this i mean they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power the vindicated word promised to her amen hallelujah sure there'll come a time where people can't buy or sell unless they have the mark of the beast the number of his name and you know but look at this now when he gets all the money um when he gets the money all under control then he'll break this covenant with the jews as daniel said here he would do it in the midst of the last half of the seventy weeks of daniel and then brother what will he do he'll have all of the world's trade and the commerce are packed with the world because he'll hold the wealth of the world completely and during that time them two prophets will rise up on the scene and call that 144 000 then what will take place then the mark of the beast of revelation 13 will set in what is it the the mark of the beast will be manifested when the rapture goes it's already been applied just like the seal of god when we are in that glorious moment where our bodies have changed before we realize it that's the full manifestation of the seal of god hallelujah we feel as glory fill our souls we love his presence and we love his word and we can look back and he changes from glory to glory our nature what we are we weren't i mean what we are we're not we're not what we used to be well he's changed us made a sweet humble kind gentle forgiving long suffering full of love patience meekness amen why what's it says all those things are wonderful but but when these bodies are changed then we'll really realize the full magnitude of what happened when we really received the lord and he filled our souls with his glorious presence hallelujah amen because he holds all the commerce trade and everything of the world and what will take place in the mark of the beast will come in that no man could buy or sell except him that has the mark of the beast thank god the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory won't have to go through that amen hallelujah read that again as well put it in yellow thank god the church will be enjoying a great three and a half year years in glory won't have to go through that i mean when that full you know what is a boycott the prophet speaks about a boycott what's boycott that's a cancel culture we use the term cancel culture today that's a boycott boycott that shop boycott those people because they do this and this and this that's cancel culture amen so we're living in the day of a boycott coming in we're living a day of this control coming in but she won't be closed up she'll be taken up i mean we'll be in the wedding supper on the skies where no man can buy or sell what do we have to be worried about hallelujah amen that's why i say don't get caught up in what's going on in the world right the vaccine's a health thing you've got to know to take it or not but don't don't not take it out of because you're afraid amen you've got everything you do you got to do in faith even medicine you take a doctor's advice you got to take it all in faith right right the lord tells just say for example you know you get cancer and the lord tells you no no you don't need chemotherapy and it's a genuine revelation you've got to receive that in faith and that and that revelation will take you beyond right these symptoms that you're feeling in your body or if the lord says no you need to go get treatment brother brown took all of his children himself he went to the doctor first right amen so you know but everything we do we have to do in faith we can't be living afraid but what is all this stuff happening in the world it's fear oh it could be this and this is this you know there's so many videos i've watched and they talk about the science of different things i just i'm just going to mention this but because i've sat too long in lecture theaters and i know what they're talking about i can go and do some more research and say no no they use the terms but what they're saying is not true but it puts a fear because it couldn't yeah everything man touches is flawed right everything so of course there's going to be problems with medicine right because it's fallen man trying his best but you got everything you do you got to do in faith but don't let fair rule you don't be afraid we don't need to be afraid and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed into the day of redemption amen and if you're sealed in amen the devil can't break that seal images like brother kaido did at the camp you know he took like a sealed bottle he threw it around the seal house hallelujah you know you don't need to be afraid now this is a man-made seal so it could break but yeah when god steals something it ain't gonna bust open it ain't gonna break hallelujah you can't even scratch it hallelujah doesn't matter remember a man can so serve god that the devil doesn't know what to do with him so he can do he can throw you through many great afflictions many great trials but even in spite of every trial you just praise god holly because remember our walk with god is not you the trial in god or you and your bank account and god oh it's full praise the lord it's empty oh this is dumb no praise the lord anyhow amen oh how's god going to fix us this great trial i don't see a way out praise the lord anyhow we worship god amen you don't need to worry about your body amen we'll get to that but see we're sealed to the day of our redemption i love this that's from the testimony of a true witness now one reason that i'm a calvinistic thinker of security of the believers because that i believe that when a man or a woman is in their right mind that is the time to accept the lord jesus and get it all settled then once forever because when we come to the end of the road we don't know just where and how we're going to be sick we may be sick in our mind and there may be a fever that could really cook cook our very brain yep and we might say anything or do anything at the end of the road we don't know but you see if we have already anchored in christ no matter what sickness takes us or what condition we're in when we go it's already settled hallelujah so i could something construct me could fly my brain and i could do something absolutely crazy you think that man is he's beyond obviously he wasn't sealed because look what happened no no it's already settled hallelujah you know the jehovah's witnesses they you know we were talking i think christine was coming but you know they're afraid if they get dementia they forget about jehovah therefore they're lost so they're depending on their physical state to fix their spiritual state and this is what people do with the mark of the beast you've got to outwit the devil so you don't get marked so my question is if it is a vaccine or a microchip or whatever all those who don't get it are they the bride then and they can be agnostics atheists they can be all kinds of things totally deny there is a lord jesus christ are they the bride just because that no it doesn't work it's a spiritual to accept the seal of you know to reject one is to accept the other and to accept one is to reject the other so if you accept the baptism of the holy ghost you reject the mark of the beast but if you accept truth you reject the mark of the beast but if you reject truth you accept the mark of the beast i say things around around the wrong way so i trust that made sense that's one or the other hallelujah amen so it doesn't matter see we are sealed in the day of our redemption ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby we're sealed into the day not of your death or but of your redemption see after death is done over you are still sealed amen hallelujah you know i've i endured 90 minutes of a video saying that the vaccine has gene editing technology in it and they're targeting the god gene and people and if that gene is taken out people won't serve god anymore i want those 90 minutes back of my life because what people are looking at is they're actually depending oh my physical state makes me a believer or not no and so therefore they think that the devil can somehow stop people becoming believers or staying believers we know a sister who got vaccinated she says i still love the lord she obviously saw it too or heard about it but it's fear-mongering now i say that for a reason not to be a joke but if we're scriptural trained we'll see no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i'll raise him up at the last day so he says it's god that does a drawing it's not a gene in you it's not some genetic trait that therefore you've somehow got this gene therefore you're a christian or a believer no no god does the drawing irrespective of our race our color our forebears you could be the if you could trace your family tree back you might be literally the only bride member in your tree because remember jesus said the wind bloth where it listeth you know it comes from here goes here you know you don't know how that happens but that's how everyone is born to the spirit of god hallelujah hey a lot of us came out of came out of deep pits where where a lot of us would look at us back then and say they aren't coming they don't believe they're not interested but god saw us he put a cg to predestination that cannot be edited out by any of man's ideas or abilities right and that's before the foundation of the world [Music] amen so no man can come to accept my father draws except the father which has sent me draw him and then and then the same same chapter and what if you shall see the son of man ascend up from where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing amen the words i speak into the spirit in our life so it's not the genes you have it's not your mental ability to put it all together it's a spirit that makes it live amen i'm glad it's that way it would have gone way over my head somewhere if it was praise the lord praise the lord of the sin exams to take a rapture we have the sudden exam to overcome this is not this is not a lecture this is not a man-made man-made religion is do you understand it mentally and if you do you've passed the test like people who get baptized in other churches they've got to sit a course about baptism you don't need to sit at course just repent and be baptized name lord jesus christ give your life and be baptized in his name name lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost peter did not say when they were pricked in their hearts and said men and brethren what shall we do he didn't say now okay hold on we're just building a school we've got semester one is turning up and you come and sit this course and then we'll baptize you and then you'll receive the holy ghost no but that's man's idea sorry i see time is running away amen so now where were yes see the flesh prophet is nothing the words that i speak into the spirit they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning whom they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore i send you that no man can come unto me except to be given unto him of my father i receive something hallelujah my father gave it to me i can come hallelujah i can come amen revelations 13 8 and all that dwell upon the face i mean upon the earth shall worship him that's the beast whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb's land from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear hallelujah uh my name's written in glory there's a name that's written in glory and it's mine and it's mine see i put that in because it's not it's not our mental ability we're not going to outsmart the devil and not take the mark that's not how this works and fear him not which which kill the body don't be afraid of that guy but but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him that is able to destroy both the soul and body in hell so don't fear those that can harm your body don't live in fear of that guy fear the one that can destroy your body and soul in hell so what what jesus is saying if i can put it in my own english is pay attention to the one that can destroy the body and soul listen to him don't listen to this world they can just harm your body amen but i wanted to get that myth get their message to you that you are not part of uh that you are part of this resurrection see don't worry about it no more see just rejoice over it who's been sealed in just rejoice over it just rejoice over the devil doesn't want you to rejoice just rejoice in it just be happy lord i know where i'm going lord you've washed my sins away you have cleansed me lord there's a time in my life you know why i love september because in september 2007 i met him and he changed my life hallelujah i was there studying chemistry i was in the rutherford science library at university of canterbury uh studying chemistry and just a conviction came upon me god was dearly before that and a conviction came upon me and that conviction said if you died right now without the holy ghost you'd be lost and i packed up my books i went into my walk back to my flat i laid my whole life down hello thank god for conviction thank god for finding me hallelujah i'm sure he's found you too you can rejoice there was a moment maybe in a service maybe the camp maybe you're in your car maybe you'll walk you along somewhere i don't know where you were when jesus found you but just go back to that moment because he found you because he resurrected you from death to life hellus you can rejoice we can just be happy about it we can just be thankful hallelujah don't let this world drag you down this world is falling but we're ascending as john andy said last night it's time to arise hallelujah hallelujah don't worry about it no more see just rejoice over it hallelujah amen how's the best way to be salty just bubble and people are going to say you know you see people who are rejoicing in something you know it attracts people and people say i want what they have have you ever seen a sad grumpy salesman they could have the best product in the world and they're down they're mopey and they're grumpy and that guy is not going to sell nothing [Music] hey man he or she but if they're happy they're excited because they've got the product and how great it is but it's just a genuine oh this is awesome have you tried you should see this look at this here just pick it up hold it oh look at that and look what it does oh my this is awesome yeah i'm so glad i got it you know and actually because they're so happy about it people like i'm on there too hey amen now i'm not talking about phones now i'm talking about eternal life oh my just hold it tyson see the lord's good hallelujah he's so wonderful look at look he changed my life i mean i'm on my way to heaven i mean i know that i know that i know that my sins are forgiven i know they've been washed away by the blood amen it's nothing i did it's all that he did and he came and changed my life hallelujah just experience it amen embrace him love him rejoice in him hallelujah that's how you be salty because bill say that guy's happy she's happy amen hallelujah the world thinks we're not happy no we're happy hallelujah amen that's how we should be so we'll just finish this quote then the musicians can come amen um when the government put a seal upon a package no way where are we there is nothing nowhere can separate you from it nothing say nothing nothing can separate me from the love of god nothing nothing is of something hallelujah glory eternally secured in the kingdom of god when god has stamped his seal upon you amen you're to the end of the destination amen hallelujah when the government puts a seal upon a package the railroad puts a seal on a door that door could not be tampered with until it reaches its destination when god puts a seal upon a man and the seal is the holy spirit when he seals a man like that he has gone to his eternal destination never no more can he ever ever go back anymore because remember ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed for all time see you're sealed forever you are sealed eternally into the kingdom of god by the holy spirit now think of that hallelujah you're having a bad day think about this you're having a tough day think about this family's going sideways think about this church is going sideways think about this life is going sideways think about this i mean think about what he's done for you hello change your whole perspective this is what we need this way i said if you want unbelief in your life plug into the wrong things be on social media read the news too much as we focus on the negative stuff amen but if you want rapturing faith hallelujah have a relationship with the living word absorb it into your life read it ponder it think about it pray about it rejoice in him listen to the word hallelujah hallelujah i went from lost but then i found a product this is the message this is the the bible i didn't have a church to go to i had the tapes and i had my bible and i was a lost university student lost in the world but i but i got a product i didn't have to buy it it was given to me hallelujah and then it didn't take too long when i decided to give myself to it i went from last to found oh yeah you know you're so happy when you think about it man that was such a great time in my life and he's better now amen hallelujah amen and now i know i've got a home in glory land that outshines the sun hallelujah what does that mean i become indifferent to the condition of the world no we should have a burden for this lost and dying world we can't fix this world it's prophesied to be destroyed right but we shall have a burden for everyone lord may we prayerfully pursue them that they can come in and we can go home with godly love and respect not thinking we're anything i'm nothing i'm nothing i have no reputation this is not some kingdom building exercise he is everything amen and the thing is when you introduce the law to someone you're not introducing yourself to that person you're not trying to connect yourself to that person that they have to spiritually look at you no you're you're giving the product hallelujah hallelujah and they just fall in love with the product and it's not you having spiritual lordship over someone no it's them falling in love with jesus christ hallelujah amen let's just finish this shall we let's just stand to our feet amen if you've got the holy ghost just give praise if you haven't just say lord jesus change my life fill me oh god hallelujah hallelujah lord jesus blessed heavenly father lord i want to thank you very much lord this world lord this world is broken lord we don't rejoice in it lord jesus lord i feel like john must have been after lord you revealed the book of revelation to him he saw the great glories of you but he saw the great destruction of god and different things but even at the end of it lord he said oh lord jesus even so come quickly and that's how how's desire come quickly lord you're the one that we're looking for lord jesus father i pray dear god that you would help us lord jesus to be salty lord may we not get caught up in what's going on what's trending lord it doesn't matter lord there will come a time when it won't even be it won't even be a memory but lord jesus you still will be lord jesus we'll be gathered around your throne lord i look forward to that day lord jesus we're lord we're sitting with the redeemed lord i lo will be there i believe oh god round the wedding supper table you'll come out and wipe every tear from our eyes oh god saying it's all over children you can just rest now hallelujah lord jesus we are so thankful lord for your seal of god for your baptism of the holy ghost lord hallelujah was a september lord 2007 when you put that seal on my heart oh god hallelujah to your name lord jesus i want to thank you dear god father i want to pray for each one here lord if any of us here are caught up in any anything of this world and not you father i pray that that influence would die in the name of jesus christ father i pray it would be silenced oh god lord that all the desires we have to feed on those things and watch those things and listen father whatever however much merit it may have it doesn't matter oh god it's not eternal lord it won't save anyone it won't save our household it won't save ourselves oh god father only you are the savior lord jesus only you are the redeemer oh god so if i don't pray our affections towards those things oh god father maybe turn to you in the name of jesus christ father may we not be caught up in conspiracy and politics and lord jesus the world powers falling and rising oh god father may we not get caught up in those things lockdowns and whatever more but father may we be caught up in you lord jesus help us lord oh god may you be the one we love and cherish and obey and worship oh god father may you be the main thing on our hearts father lord because we know our god that we could lord jesus we could convince the world if we could convince the world that the world's coming to an end and they believe us lord that won't help them lord but if they believe you oh god and meet you that's the only thing that can help anyone oh god father to escape the wrath that's to come father i pray you'd help us in this late hour and dear god may we may we truly sign cry for the abomination is done but lord may we have joy unspeakable full of glory father when we think about how great lord how great the golf that you did span lord define us lord we were lost and undone without you or your son but you reach down your hand oh way down lord i'm so glad your arm is not short lord father you can reach down further than we can even look up we praise your mighty name o god father i pray you bless each one father and i just ask that god may take this chopped up service and may we see that the mark of the beast is a mark of apostasy to reject truth lord to turn from it father lord jesus and leave your presence that way like cain did lord there's a pattern through the scripture and father i pray you'd forgive each one that's done that lord jesus father they've walked away for whatever reason bring them back for your glory because ultimately lord it's not us who decides who's marked or sealed lord it's you o god that does it father so i pray you'd be merciful to to to everyone around us oh god in the name of jesus christ and lord may we just rejoice lord we're sealed in by your spirit lord until the day of our redemption oh we praise your mighty name we thank you lord in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah amen praise the lord amen we have the musicians please this morning hallelujah hallelujah i want to sing one song
