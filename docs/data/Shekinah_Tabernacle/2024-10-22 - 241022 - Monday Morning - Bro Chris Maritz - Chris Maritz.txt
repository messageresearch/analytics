[Music] we're still on on the trail we're we're in hunting mode amen and so this morning we're just going to um we want to just leave some tools in your hands to give you some boxes of ammunition amen and to give you some sense and and you know calls to make and things like that so we just want to equip you a little bit more this morning and um and then we'll just see how the Lord leads but you know we just love to go to the word the word is what encourages us and this morning I want to just take a story and I want to call the sermon today Abigail's headship and want to look at the story and and the story helps us understand really what God has done for us with a headship that he's provided in our lives and to do this we need to go through the New Testament Romans 7. so if you'll turn that with me this morning Romans 7 verse 1. Romans 7 verse 1. says know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man he shall be called an adulterous but if her husband is dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brother and you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should be brought that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now I love that amen but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter let's just borrow his morning gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you this morning and surely we as that song Lord can say Lord that all our lives you have been faithful to us and even now at this moment Lord you are faithful Lord and you know Lord as we are closing this this this session of services Lord in this Camp Lord we just ask that you would come Lord father that you would drop something into our hearts Lord that would give us strength that would give us courage give us Faith Lord for this last lap of the race that we are running Lord as we want to run a good race Lord we want to find a good fight Lord the Lord we ask you you would come Lord we just humble ourselves before you this morning that you would speak Lord give us Words of Life Lord encourage us for the journey father give us Clarity of thought and mind Lord oh Father we love you this morning we appreciate all that you've done for us Lord we thank you for this time we can spend together and just as you would come now bless the reading of your word and in Jesus Christ then we pray amen and amen amen you may have your seats so we see the story of of of this husband and wife here in in Romans 7 and that there that we were Bound by this law even nobody likes to be bound by the law you know you have to go certain speed limits and you have to do this and you can only do that and you know you have to pay certain taxes and you know all these little things seem to kind of restrict or govern or bind you right now some of those things are good but you know in this case when it's the when being bound by the law of the flesh as it works in our members you know it's not a good thing and so it speaks of a headship or something that influences or leads and but God is telling us today that we are not bound by that law anymore amen that we have another law amen the law of the newness of spirit not the oldness of the letter and to really understand how this works I I was inspired to go to the story of Abigail and where I'd like to illustrate this this principle of the two different laws that work in our lives and and how that works through the story of Abigail find the story of Abigail in first Samuel and 25. now today I'm going to just focus on the story so if you want to follow along you can you can have your Bibles open to those places there in first Samuel and 25. now there's very little said about Abigail you know there's brother Brandon mentions her mentions her only twice I believe in in the whole message the once in reference to marriage and divorce and then in another place speaking about headship and this is really you know if if we if we if we zoom out from the message and we look at the whole message you'll find that really the story of Abigail is the whole message you know so the prophet does speak about Abigail in types and shadows and and in patterns and we're going to find this as we go into the story today Samuel here in the in the very in the very beginning here first Samuel 25 it begins right off by letting us know that Samuel the prophet of the day I mean he was that he was the the prophet he was the word of God for that day and it says that he had passed off the scene you know Samuel the prophet was dead and so we see right in this transition of Samuel passing off the scene you know David was anointed to be king and and we see this great transition taking place and and how David was going to become king over all of Israel and he was anointed to be king but he wasn't king yet at this time so so we see how that the prophet has moved off the scene we have this little woman Abigail who's kind of a mystery in the story at this time and then we see how that the king king is coming to be king over Israel and his name is David and so we find ourselves right in the very pattern again of where we live right now because the prophet has moved off the scene and we're living right in this little Gap here where where King David is coming Amen in the Millennium reign and so we we're kind of living right in this very story this very moment of Abigail's life and I'm so thankful that God put Abigail in the scriptures that we can look at her life and we can see the patterns we can see what God did for Abigail amen because he's doing it for us amen we are Abigail in the story so we see how Samuel passes off and David what's David doing David's running you're right he's hiding he's kind of this this hit this mystery you know he's hiding from from persecution and you know what has happened is David has become rejected by his own family right he got rejected to those who whom he was sent to he was rejected so we find him he he he's kind of uh you know running around all of all the country sides and finding places to sleep and you know wherever he's welcome you know there he'll stay and and just kind of this you know who is this David running around amen but I want you to know that in all this time David was fighting for Israel amen even though he was rejected you know he he didn't leave them alone he he still fought for Israel during this time protecting them and watching over them fighting Israel's enemy enemies amen oh I hope you've got your spiritual thinking caps on this morning and so here we find Abigail this little mystery woman in the story coming from the south of Judah and you can look at her lineages and and so forth It's really beautiful how God put all this together and Abigail her name means my father's Joy so here this little mystery woman she's got a meaning to her name amen she's her father's Joy even though she may be going through a Troublesome time even though she's maybe facing hardships and things but my brother and sister her real name the real herd like our brother condrey's been preaching and the real you amen is my father's Joy the woman also of good understanding in other words she had she had the ability to when she heard the word to understand it amen she had understanding she had wisdom there was something about Abigail where where something happens she would understand she had discernment for what was happening like that woman at the well and another meaning for her name is that she was beautiful you know that's really how God saw her through you know as we get into the story of Abigail remember this is how God sees her right no matter what her circumstances were or the conditions we find Abigail in her name means beautiful this is how God sees her because God was doing something for her during this time so let's let's look a little bit at Abigail now we want to focus in on headship because this the the subject matter here is Abigail's headship and as we enter the story of Abigail we find that Abigail is under a certain headship oh boy she's she's being led by some thing you know headship speaks of control it speaks of influence it speaks of leadership it speaks of dictatorship you know it can mean all those kinds of things headship what kind of headship are we sitting under right now this very morning what is influencing your thoughts what is what is governing your life you know this is speaking of headship because I believe the bride is sitting under a headship today and it's for a reason my brother and sister now her husband at the time was Mabel and I want you to notice that you know he wasn't a Philistine or something like that he was on the house of Caleb you know he he was in the message you know this guy was he grew up in the message he's from the right Bloodlines and all these things but you know something happened with nabel he it also thought it was amazing how my brother Condrey was was hitting on these things he was a rich man you know he was a rich man my brother and sister he had he had goods and cattle and all kinds of possessions he even had a Vineyard and as the Bible says he liveth in prosperity [Music] so this was her her husband was someone you know they weren't poor people that were scrounging for little bits of food here and there and Beggars on the street somewhere no she had a really good environment if you think about it yeah you know she had all the goods you know like lay the Sia rich half need of nothing right and doesn't know that she is blind and miserable naked right but this is a condition we find Abigail in but her her husband's name means fool even though he was rich he had all those great things now remember this is head shift now now I'm going to drop this in here just for a moment here remember headship speaks of of those two different laws all right let's get take it right back to Romans 7 now where he was saying that he's relating the the the marriage relationship between a husband and a wife to the same headship type figure of what your flesh is or the law of the spirit so we're either like headship being our flesh or headship can be our the spirit of God in our life so our flesh can be a headship right we're going to see these parallels Nable just so in case you're wondering Naval is the type of the flesh so as we talk about navel in the story today remember he types our flesh and his name means fool even though he may feel good even though he might be young and strong and have all the goods in the world maybe a rich man my brother and sister if it's only carnal he's a fool he lived in Mayon his possessions were in Carmel I mean he he lived in in the great places he lived in all the right position and you know in the right lands and you know everything was what seems right but let's look at his name a little bit further his name literally means churlish it sounds like uh sour milk Fearless what does it mean to be surely now remember this is kind of headship that Abigail's under how many you know sisters here would like to live under a headship like this husband that is fearless huh there was no amen that's good what does churlish mean now remember this is our flesh it means to be severe this is Abigail's environment it means to be cruel Grievous hard-hearted heavy-handed impudent obstinate always prevailing like it like a dictator it means to be rough or sore or sorrowful stiff-neck stubborn and always in trouble the flesh this was the headship now I want us to put ourselves in Abigail's kind of scene you know in her home this is what she lived under this was her headship this is what it's like to live under the headship of the flesh our flesh is severe it carries scars it reminds us of things always telling us that we are not capable we're not strong enough you know it governs our our emotions and all kinds of things in our walk with the Lord and it's stubborn and stiff-necked it's cruel but another headship was coming amen a new headship was coming to Abigail now look at the season here this is in harvest season when this story is taking place where we find Abigail in this condition of of a of a terrible husband and we find out David is coming in in a certain season you know it's a season of harvest and and plenty and so what David does now I want you to look at the different kinds of headships look at the the stark contrast between the two different kinds of headstrip here David speaking of another headship which in our story is going to be a type of the spirit of Christ in our lives and you find that David here he approaches things very differently than nabel does David when he comes he's looking for food for his men you know they've been fighting the Philistines and protecting Mabel's lands and his Vineyards and and literally allowing nabel to be prosperous this is the part that Naval doesn't really understand amen but look at how that David when he comes to approach navel for food for his men he sends Messengers ahead of him you know he doesn't just come barging in and they know expecting something no he's a gentleman and so what does he do he sends Messengers ahead of him amen preparing the ground letting the people know what his intentions are I mean he's soft and he's kind any any sincere amen he's respectful look at the examples as we even see in the Kingdom of Heaven invitations being sent out Messengers being sent out and I love this setting we find ourselves in this morning like a wedding kind of setting here this morning amen what does he say his first words that comes out of his mouth now remember look at the contrast between David and Abel the naval being cruel and hard and and stubborn and sorrowful and hurtful kind of a person here David's the first words that comes out of his his Messengers mouths are peace be unto you in other words Shalom amen peace be unto you and to your house in other words your children in other words David's thinking not just of the individual anybody's thinking about the families and their children and all those things he comes with a message of peace even though remember David is a warrior he's a fighter he's a hunter amen he knows what he's doing but he doesn't come that way to nabel you know he doesn't come there with a drawn sword and threats and judgment know his first approach my brother and sister is always with a message of peace Hallelujah peace unto you and your house and unto all that you have in verse 7 we find how that he remarks on his Shepherds that were shearing the sheep near the Wilderness of Paran in that ornamental type desert as the name would denote for us today but he compliments them on their work you know even we sign we see even in Book of Revelation how that those Messengers come and they and gods through those Messengers compliments the people of the day the Believers amen I know your works and you know so God compliments amen he's encouraging why because he's trying to find a way into to your heart amen David what's the reason nabel was being blessed and so he comes and he and he makes gestures of of friendliness amen I love a god like that you know God isn't here to hurt you my brother and sister he doesn't come to judge you he comes he comes as a friend he comes in peace amen hallelujah and he makes a note of the protection that his Shepherds have had during this time and why why did Mabel have protection why did his Shepherds have protection it was because of the proximity they had to David okay now this is important because you know we can be in proximity to David right we can be in proximity you know in other words we can come to church and we can be in proximity of the blessings but not actually be under the headship of David see these Shepherds they were feeling the blessings they were they were reaping the rewards and and the and the benefits of David's headship but we're not under David's headship yet this is very important see we can live under the blessings we we sing the songs of worship and man I enjoyed that you know we live a good clean life and our families are strong and you know that's what being in proximity to the message has done for us but my brother and sister don't just live in proximity we need to come under the headship of David thank you Hallelujah so because of their location they were reaping from the rewards like the Holy Ghost being poured out in our day look at how Pentecost reap from the benefits of the proximity of Jesus Christ in our day Hallelujah but the point here is is that David comes not to hurt he doesn't come to do anything that you cannot handle you see he doesn't come to to hurt that word there is to to not to wound yeah he doesn't want to wound you he doesn't come to tease you know he doesn't come with an agenda and says you know he comes in peace and he's not really coming in peace his true motive towards you is to bring you to a destination he doesn't come to insult oh my God then he goes on he says also we did not hurt them or take any of their sheep in other words we did not abuse you know we did not abuse your shepherds in the sense of we did not take advantage of the fact that we are warriors and that you know you know he they could have come so different they could have said you know we we are the reason why you have sheep we're the reason why you have all these things so so we're just going to take a shape and we're going to slaughter one and and we're gonna have one for supper you know they they didn't abuse their position you know these men knew their position you know the messengers of God they they know their positions they don't abuse their Authority they're not dictators you know they're not licking nicolaitanisms you know there's nothing like that in them they they totally are there to protect you and so they start to describe the the setting that was happening out there in the field to these men you know this is much very very different very you know opposite if we can say it like that to the way that nabel had been treating Abigail think of Abigail's environment and hear this message of Hope is coming out across the field in The Vineyards amen oh my verse 8 goes on and The Messengers come and they say we have come on a good day we have come on a good day what are they saying when they say we have come on the good day in other words these Messengers did not come in a time of famine they did not come in a time when nabel would not be able to offer them food where Nable would not be able to help them you know these Messengers knew this was a time of Plenty this was Feast time this was Harvest Time and so the messengers request was not unreasonable now remember this we're talking about the Flesh and the spirit of God you know the request that God makes to us you know we think of like all these rules and regulations we have and do's and don'ts God's request is not unreasonable he comes in a good day amen his request in other words was not unfair like that that like the prophet asking the woman for that last little bit of bread and oil was was his request unfair no but you see there was a blessing that was coming behind that that request amen and that's God he's saying come unto me amen his request is not unfair he comes in a good day this is a day of your salvation you see David's request did not add an extra burden upon Naval that God doesn't come to add burdens to your life amen it might feel like that sometimes but his yoke is easy my brother and sister Hallelujah see it was a day that nabel had a feast and this Feast meant that there would be plenty to go around in those days when they had a feast it wasn't like you know we're gonna go have supper and buy some people over and we make just enough food for for the evening and we count the plates and we count how much food and you know it wasn't like that these when they did feast and in eastern Traditions it lasted for days and they always made sure here's the key they always made sure they had food for strangers that might come in and David knew this you see David knew this his request was not unreasonable there would be plenty of food to go around for him and his men and yet he comes and he makes a request to have food it would be a day when everyone was happy and in good spirits like Pentecost everyone's happy the the spirit of God is being poured out upon the people and there's gifts and all kinds of Miracles being being on display and all these wonderful things at the time of happiness oh my he's not an unreasonable God like some King asking for tribute asking for things in in a bad time oh my God never asked us to do anything beyond what we can handle or Supply his yoke is easy my brother and sister David asked gently to give it to his servants and look at this he says unto thy son he humbles himself even into thy son as he knew they were from the same tribe oh my goodness they were from the same tribe it's not you know it's not these are not like they're not strangers they know each other they you know we're you know this is how our flesh Works they're gonna say our flesh truly is cruel it is severe and David even knows we have a connection we're like family can you imagine coming to a family member and asking for for some butter you know you ran out of butter you know or you ran out of sugar or something and you comment you know he's family you're not expecting them to turn you away you know it's family you get there's a connection you care for each other David's saying thy son you you know what that servants we've come to you and we we would like to Feast with you and share in this plenty you know and and day and and recognizing that we're even from the same tribes navel even being his senior oh my can you imagine the young men of today coming to the seniors and the message asking for something of God huh nabel being a senior oh my what can you spare for your servants heaven verse 10 look at the response here this this is and I want us to really uh focus in here on this is now the time for the flesh this is how the flesh responds to to this kind of thing who is David oh that's good right what does navel think of himself or his current condition to answer like that so we've just heard the kind of message that's come but now the response is who is David in other words who does David think he is wow I thought I thought David was protecting your your men out in the fields I thought you were related to David I thought you were from the same tribe and yet the flesh has no way of recognizing Who David is he has no way of recognizing this is so important my brother and sister that's why I say like you cannot go by your emotions you cannot go by feelings it goes so much deeper than that our headship cannot be flesh-bound hey man we've got to go we we need a change amen that we need to be led by the spirit amen because our flesh can never recognize David and David is the one who brings the blessings David is the good headship amen so we see how that our flesh is unable to recognize Who David is as long as we approach church as long as we come to church as long as we approach God my brother and sister in the flesh you're not really going to get to know him you need to go deeper you need to die this thing is in all your flesh needs to be cast down and brought subject to the word amen you need to come under a whole different headship don't approach god with your emotions don't approach god with memories and reasonings my brother and sister you need a different headship if you want to recognize Who David is so important you know we do so much flesh Management in the ministry dealing with emotions and trying to Band-Aid this and trying to patch this up and trying to make somebody feel good and and and and and and wipe memories away and and through reasoning try and get them to cope and and understand my my brother and sister we need to just change all that you cannot serve God In the Flesh [Music] amen you see Mabel was high-minded and unconscious of the repercussions of his actions that's our flesh unconscious of the repercussions of our flesh in other words Abigail is back at home she's in her room somewhere maybe in the garden somewhere and has no idea what her headship is doing think about this for a moment my brother and sister no idea you know she was caught like in a bear's claw you know she was in a really bad situation because she really didn't have a say in what was happening here you see that is our flesh right so she had no no way of of even knowing I'm so glad you know you think of that woman at the well right she had no way you know looking for something she knew something was off she knew that there was something more but she was looking at for it in flesh in different husbands in different headships and couldn't find it until the seventh one came along amen yeah but see she couldn't as long as she was bound by that law she didn't have a say she had no way of having an influence on what her headship was doing oh my in other words her flesh her headship was making decisions on her behalf that would bring repercussions that eventually would destroy Abigail yeah flesh does that we open our ear to something or open our hearts to something and our flesh is doing something my brother and sister you have no idea of the repercussions you know it's amazing you can and I know God has a season for everyone but you know you can you can tell them you know there's a better way and you know there's why not come under the headship of the Lord you know he'll take care of all your troubles you know his yoke is easy amen he loves you he cares for you and to hear all of that my brother and sister but something is is not allowing them their flesh is not allowing them to come out from under that headship but see this there's something that needs to happen and we'll get to that so he was unaware of the consequences she also being unaware of the consequences that was coming you know to basically spit in the messenger's face to Mock and insult David's servants you'll find that he doesn't just say no you know I I like a Canadian would you know I'm sorry but we're just not interested you know very gently that's not how this guy did it right this guy was cruel he doesn't just say no but he goes and insults David that's our flesh for you huh you know we got to put this flesh down because it's terrible see he he it was about he he was not about to share or give anything and so what does he do he doesn't just say no he starts to make accusations oh my goodness you know starts to try and justify himself maybe huh tries to justify why he doesn't have to do something well I don't have to come under that headship or why I don't have to share with all the blessings that I've received or or recognize that David is here in our in our midst you know there's there's something about our flesh that is unable to do those things it's under a curse curse of the wrong headship oh my and that's really something because if you think about Abigail's situation she might she was a woman of understanding she might have known like something's wrong right we'll get to that in a minute but think of it you know she was bound by a law by a law in other words she couldn't just one day say you know what this is this is kind of lame and I'm out of here I'm leaving and just walk away get a divorce right she couldn't do that because she is bound by a law he pretends not to know them he pretends not to know David and he sends them away empty-handed not realizing that he owes David everything he had he owed to David see naval's condition his nature did not allow him to see really who David was to recognize who was calling unto him are you the son of Jesse he says you know Jesus asked the same question in his day who do you say that I the son of man am Peter received Revelation Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you see Revelation did what for Peter it gave Peter access to the blessings that was in front of him so Revelation is Paramount that's what God built his church on see and this is the process that we go through right amen is that God gives us Revelation so that we can see I'm so thankful that God showed us by Revelation who he is in our day that we can see him amen notice this question here are you the son of Jesse something very important happening here are you the son of Jesse in other words he's almost admitting like the devil right if Thou Art the son of God he knows he knows enough but the flesh cannot you know it's always reasoning always questioning you know it's same old tricks Same Old Devil same old headship amen all right the same thing was about to happen to Abigail and her revelation of Who David really was would give her access to His blessings not just access but would change her headship so don't forget who Abigail is is and all this don't forget her behind the scenes here as we're moving forward her headship is making decisions on her behalf and and David's trying to gain access and David's trying to bless and he's looking for worship he's looking for something in return right and in the meantime Abigail has no say in all this but her headship is failing her look at David's response here in verse 13. I think it's incredible all the numbers everything here just lines up perfectly because 13 is the is the number of the US and all these things right so look at this here David realized who and what he was dealing with because of the treatment to his servants and rejected and rejecting of his kind requests what does he do he turns from a god of Grace to a god of judgment [Music] David's a warrior remember this is not like a big deal for him he just arms his men right same old procedure right he arms 400 of his men to go and deal with Naval so now because of the rejection of the message so this is Abigail's headship right she he rejected the message he rejected David and the benefits and now it's turned to a judgment and Abigail doesn't even realize what's happened just yet can you imagine that right we're born in sun-shaped and iniquity coming to the world speaking lies here we find out one day hey wait a minute wait a minute you know who's what's going on with my headship something's off something's wrong you know but I'm so thankful that there was another Messenger on the scene as we go on through the story you find another messenger who was involved in all this who had insight to the meetings and had insight to the the responses from both sides he he goes and he finds Abigail this is Abigail's servant you know the servant is is sent to Abigail specifically amen with a word of warning hey something has happened your your flesh your headship has has made the wrong decision amen this servant was one of the the servants that received the message and he believed David's servants mentioned in the beginning that that the men there would be able to testify so here we find even how that in in the story how that The Messengers that David sent he says that those men will be able to testify of what we have said and done in this place you see he was there in the wilderness when David's men was protecting him he tasted of the goodness of David's rule interesting that one out of these Witnesses this servant actually goes directly to Abigail tells her of all that had taken place that her husband had rejected David and was unable to meet the needs of David tells her that her headship does not recognize who he was talking to and this is important this meant that they would be disconnected from David's protection and you know how Naval responded to his servants he railed upon them he didn't just you know say no he rails upon them what a headship the headship she was under not only didn't didn't recognize Who David really was but rails upon the servants and the scriptures tells us that he flew at them he flew upon them in other words he attacks the message Messengers and great Fury and in anger and this servant comes to Abigail and describes the experiences that he's had oh my you know I'm so glad that somebody came our way in the cool of the evening while all that was happening judgment was setting in oh think about it my brother and sister judgment was setting in on this thing because of a bad headship because of our circumstances but God sent us a message Amen to come and tell us what David had done become and tell us what Mabel is doing to come and tell us that the judgment is coming it's on the west coast you know these come to tell us you know that it's time to break out it's time to come out of these things that you're gonna die here if you don't do something judgment is coming he tells Abigail everything he discloses all the Plan of Redemption everything that was taking place oh my God he says as long as we were in conversant with them that's interesting as long as we were in other words in communion with David and his men as long as we walk together we were safe it starts to describe to her the kind of headship David brings when we were out there in the fields then the wolf came in there was there was the shepherd there was David the shepherd boy amen the Giant Slayer he was there in the fields you know as long as we were in communion with David everything was good we were safe [Music] Oh my he was trying to tell Abigail Abigail you need this kind of headship you need to come under this kind of headship as long as we're walking with the word amen we're safe amen but as long as we're walking with Mabel we're not safe you're under that curse of judgment David was like those angels that were encamped about them amen you see they wouldn't bother them because they noticed whom they were walking with in other words they were safe as long as they were with the servants that were under the headship of David and this must have meant something to Abigail can you imagine Abigail living under this headship of Cruelty of severity with a heavy hand and you can see how he even treats servants can you imagine how he how he treated his own wife how we treated that little lady this little woman you know she was a beautiful little lady but look at how he didn't he didn't see that he didn't care that she was beautiful he didn't care that she was a woman of understanding that she was her father's Joy he didn't care he doesn't see that my brother and sister he only cares about himself and he's selfish and stubborn and severe he's churlish and here she's living in this situation can you imagine when this messenger came and told her about this headship that's coming told her about David's men and how it was to be in his presence how it was to be around his protectors they're on his Messengers how it was to be in the services that weekend Hallelujah oh that must have meant something to Abigail verse 16 goes on says they were they were a wall unto us both by night and by day protecting and defending them against the Philistines you see Abigail now in verse 17. the numbers are perfect amen verse 17 Abigail must make a decision because now the son of man has been revealed to her you know some there's been a revelation amen the messenger has come to tell her you know this is who you are and this is who navel is and this is Who David is here's the story and here's now you got to make a decision Abigail this is important because remember we could sit there under our headship of Flesh and blame and justify our condition on our flesh well my dad always was hot tempered so I'm hot tempered right and that's just too bad you know it's too bad David's coming I I don't know you know it's it's just too bad but I'm stuck you know we can make excuses for ourselves and go into a depression even allowing that flesh to govern our life and and and but you know my brother and sister Abigail made a decision you know Abigail unto this point she hasn't been been given the opportunity to have a say or to do anything for her situation you know she's done nothing but her headship has put her in this terrible situation because she was under him and because she was under him she would fall with him now consider now what you will do the Bible tells us consider now what you will do and I want to say that this morning consider now what you will do so much like Esther her actions would not only affect her but it would affect her household and her children the way she would respond in other words see Naval has had an opportunity but the way Abigail would respond would affect not just her but her family her household like Esther her response is she says he is such a son of Belial in other words she knows she recognizes her flesh as incapable of recognizing David that is so important my brother and sister we need to recognize this flesh our emotions our memories our feelings is unable just cast it aside just cast aside our flesh amen cast aside reasonings and doubts and fears this flesh is unable it's a son of the LIE which is to say he is worthless he is Lawless he's ill-natured it is not worth discussing anything with this man in other words Abigail realized it's not worth taking what she just heard back to her flesh her headship because she knew that headship cannot do the right thing so what what must she do what must Abigail do now after discussing this verse 18 we find out words like you know make haste quickly you know what must Abigail do who is who is Abigail what position does Abigail hold what influence does she have you might feel like you're just a little housewife somewhere or you know maybe you're just a janitor somewhere or you're the doormat at the church you know you might feel like you're just insignificant so what in what position what rights what what tools do I have oh brother uh Cadre was handing out two seventies last night amen you know God will equip you with just the right things he gave shamgar a Jawbone he gave David a sling you know he's given his bride the word you know just just take a look around take a look around in your life and just say Lord what have you given me Lord You're Here amen I want access to David I want access to his benefits I want access to his protection so Lord give me something that I can break free from my situation so what influence what can she do you know Abigail she was a woman of wisdom this is beautiful I love I love this because what does she do she quickly puts together food she puts food together you know you might say what is that you know there's 400 trained men coming what's she gonna do with food you know judgment has been declared what's he going to do with food what is that anyway you know what what is this what kind of an approach is this but see Abigail knew the desire of David's heart isn't that amazing that she knew he was looking for substance he was looking for food amen where the Eagles that gathered there the carcasses amen it's all about the food amen the word oh my it's all about the word my brother and sister so she already instinctively something inside of her tells her David is wanting food so she quickly puts food together in wine and corn prepares everything to give to David and his men she's going to meet an army in the time of judgment with food that's how we meet our Lord and savior my brother and sister is with the word of God Amen as God is moving in and we see judgments sweeping and we see the chaos in this world we see all those things we see how this world is again falling apart again and again and again over and over and we see judgment taking its toll my brother and sister but in that time there's a bride who has food who's going to meet David [Music] oh my the key here is that she can respond to David's call but she's still stuck under the headship of Mabel oh my you see even though our emotions may say something our feelings may say something my brother and sister Reach Out you might be under the wrong headship this morning but you have every right to reach out to God don't talk it over with your flesh just make a move towards God gather what you've got pick up the pieces of your life and bring it to David [Music] see whether she was in the right position or not she wasn't concerned about the politics and things like that whether she was allowed to or not remember Esther even she says even though I know it's not lawful but she knew the blessings was there in the throne room [Music] she responds she sends a messenger ahead of her son's praying in other words huh she sends a messenger ahead of her and does not even mention this happening to to nabel you see she has changed now she she recognizes what's happening and she she realizes you know that navel cannot make the right decision for her that it's it's bad it's all bad so she's not interested in nabel's opinion anymore amen she's not interested in his opinion the blessings in David your freedom is in David right who cares about what the flesh is saying amen she knew where she stood in this she was interested in that request that David made she was interested because she was not just saving herself but she'd be saving her house now here's just a little side note just something free for all of you sisters if you want to calm a warrior down if you want to bring a warrior an angry person down from his his high horse just make him some food hey man all the brothers said amen amen just create an atmosphere this is the bride's weapons huh you see this is what we've been given we're a bride for a reason God's not looking for a prophet God's not looking for for a great Army in the end time he's raised up his little bride and what does she do she's good at Fellowship she's good at preparing food amen why because that creates an atmosphere the word creates an atmosphere that brings our children in it calms down the Judgment amen do we have a place of Refuge in those times amen well judgment is out there we have a place of safety why because of the food that's been given to the bride thank you [Applause] now here for the first time Abigail would come to meet David face to face oh it's so beautiful like Sodom and Gomorrah in the end times right before the destruction there's a meeting that takes place comes face to face they've had God unveiling himself amen Hallelujah I hope you appreciate what God's done in our day for us like the wedding of the bride and groom oh my right before that there's a there's a meeting that takes place in Heavenly places verse 21 goes on says David realizes that he doesn't it doesn't matter what he has done for nabel it just doesn't matter because the flesh cannot recognize it the navel has rejected him insulted him made fun of him mocked him all of his Good Deeds his protection and his care for navel has been rejected His Kind message and Messengers have been rejected repaid him with with not just rejecting him but repaid him with evil turning against him verse 23 Abigail's approach now she had a very different approach to David than Abel when she saw him she immediately came to him when she saw him she runs to him she makes her way to him she's not sending a messenger anymore she doesn't want anybody in between she wants to meet David [Music] and I thank God for The Messengers but she wants to meet David amen so she runs to him when she saw him she immediately comes to him like Rebecca to Isaac comes to him showing him reverence and respect bowing herself before him and Abigail speaks verse 24. I love that Abigail speaks whatsoever you say huh he says upon me my Lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmade I pray they speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid look at her approach now this is beautiful because it's showing the character of Abigail who is US amen Abigail could have said oh David I'm so glad I finally I met you but you know this this husband of mine he's you know he's this and he's that and my flesh does this and that and all the mistakes and you know it's just terrible and start start laying out all the things no she doesn't do that she doesn't try to justify herself or try to isolate herself from her her husband or anything like that no she comes and and she says let all the the iniquity [Music] now she didn't do it her husband did it but she recognized the headship she was under amen and so she says let all that iniquity be let it be upon me in other words like Jesus Christ let me take the brunt of the Judgment into my person so that my family can be safe see he was David when he saw that like God looking at Moses when Moses stood in the gap for his people God sees a reflection of himself [Music] this is what's in the bride we're not trying to justify ourself we're not we're not trying to fuss with this and trying to you know make out make ourselves look good or any of these things would you say Lord let the sins of my family be upon me why because we want to apply a token Lord I want to create an atmosphere of love and mercy like you did for me Lord can you imagine David in in the mode of judgment and this woman comes and Bows before him with his sword and Shields and 400 men and this woman comes and takes the whole what is he supposed to do now this woman a woman don't underestimate yourself sisters a woman stood between an army and her family [Applause] foreign you know as we're right in this moment we're right in this moment right before judgment sets in where we have an audience with the Lord just like Abraham an audience with the Lord to ask for salvation for our families stand in the gap how many stories do we need to see for us to recognize this is truly our position as the bride of Christ see I'm thankful God saved me but he saved us for a purpose you might say brother Chris I'm the only one in my family serving the lord well that's like Esther that's like Abigail amen it's like so many others in the Bible that's like Ruth amen that's like Rahab that's like able God God raises somebody to stand in the gap for the family just like Jesus Christ came into the world for his family amen it's the same nature of Christ that is in the bride today why else do you think it gave us the weapons to destroy our enemies to speak the word why do you think the third poll one of the the greatest manifestations of the third poll my brother and sister is salvation for family members it's not for riches Abigail right in the position right before David let the iniquity be upon me she takes the blame for her husband's actions showing her unconditional care and love for her household see sometimes we feel like well if I take the blame and this situation it's going to look like I'm the one that's at fault but David knows David knows who's really to blame he knows it's your flesh huh but you need to come and confess him amen David knows you know and I want to encourage you daddies and husbands and so forth you know sometimes something will happen in a relationship or in a home or in a church but you know you're the high priest of the home for a reason no one else in that household can play that part it's up to us Brothers to sometimes say you know what the fault is here right at the headship the fault is here this situation is like this because of me gather your family around and play the priesthood part save the family men do the right thing sometimes it's better to just take the Lower Road and say you know what this is my fault you know let's let's reason one with another let's gather together let's why because you're interested in Saving the family you know you're not interested in your reputation you're not interested in your name you're interested in Salvation you're interested in restoration so sometimes we got to take a lower Road my brother and sister why because we have someone's life we have someone's soul in mind we're not taking our reputations with us we're taking our families with us [Applause] oh I love Abigail I love that she could do that give us strength Lord [Music] hey so she admits the dire condition of her headship to David she says let not my Lord I pray they regard this man of Belial even nabel for as his name is so is he nabel is his name and Folly is with him but I thine handmaid so not the men the young men of my Lord whom now did send in other words I wasn't there Lord before the foundation of the world and I I was there but I don't remember you know there's this there's this there's all these conversations where she's catching up she's catching up right she's finding out what really happened in these conversations and she's saying I wasn't there and in other words if I was there at that moment I might have been able to influence them to do the right thing but see that's our flesh our flesh cannot see it she says I did not see it if I had only been there I could have persuaded him I did not see it that's our flesh for you her headship should have been able to see it right but he didn't then she identifies herself as your handmaid what is what is a handmaid it's not a servant a handmaid is a lady in waiting so what's she telling David she's saying David I'm Bound by a law to another husband and because of that law I can't do anything about it I can't go home and just kill him oh why are you laughing you know because he needs to be dead remember this now she's stuck my brother and sister she's stuck because of the law but she he needs to be dead for her to go to another headship there's no other way there's no other way to cut it and it wouldn't help if she went and murdered her own husband that would just make things worse you see so she needed somebody greater than her to intervene in the situation but look how she when she comes to David she's respectful and she says you know I'm not running off with you David right we're not going to elope in other words but David I am in waiting in other words I'll wait until God has done something I'm going to stay at the altar I'm going to wait on the Lord to to make the difference amen and my brother and sister if you're going through a hard relationship excuse me or a marriage or something just just get quiet before the Lord amen God God will intervene for you you know the unbelieving husband is saved by the believing wife and so forth you know just carry on in your in your duties as a wife and in the kitchen and and the things that you do with your children and you create an atmosphere you're a lady in waiting because God will do something for your situation like you did for Abigail just say Lord I'm Abigail Lord I need I need a change of headship change my husband's hearts [Applause] sometimes we want the easy way out but Abigail says she was a woman of understanding of wisdom she's not looking for the easy way out she knows that there needs to be a death and she's willing to wait for the for the for this experience like the Chicago Rancho story waiting for him to come home she doesn't call him you know a runaway servant because that's what nabel was accusing him of that he was a runaway servant he was trying to get away from Saul and you know who does he think he is and you know she doesn't do any of that but rather she calls him Lord she calls him Lord like the Pharisees that called Jesus a devil and yet he was their lord Abigail notices a change now in David's countenance I don't know maybe he was smelling the bacon or you know maybe the the chicken that was roasting I don't know but you know something changed in David's countenance that's this is amazing because you know my brother and sister where when we approached God where he should have been a god of wrath and judgment that's what brother Branham said he always thought that God was was angry and you know but you know that's when when you come into His presence and you start talking to him and you start communing with him and he would confess your sins to him and you repent to him what happens that his countenance starts to change Hallelujah David came there with one intent now she is seeing a change in his countenance he's looking at her his words are catching his heart see it's all about our words as the Lord liveth she says and as thy soul liveth see she touches on something that gets his attention and she says something before he even reacts she says God has held you from shedding blood God in other words she said she is recognizing that David God has done something between you and I God has has held you from shedding innocent blood in other words David's coming on the scene and and in this mode of judgment there's this mystery lady that he hadn't he hadn't quite noticed just yet she hasn't come to the Forefront in the story just yet you know because he's in judgment mode and and there's this little lady and if he had to judge the house he would have destroyed Abigail with her just like we find in the story of Moses that if God had to destroy those people who knows who all he would have destroyed maybe Joshua and Caleb was already on the scene and we wouldn't have those stories of Joshua and Caleb but see there's that mystery that's there and Abigail's the one that comes on the scene and changes us all around and changes his countenance and she recognizes and tells David that God has done something between us it's same as we can say it this morning God you have done something between us [Music] God has done something between us in other words God has brought us together like this with food here in our midst and she gives him her gifts in verse 28 she opens her heart to David put verse 28 up says I pray thee forgive the sins of thine handmaid for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house because my Lord fighteth the battles of the Lord look at this beautiful language huh and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days she knew something about David are you can imagine how this moved on David she's recognizing him as her Lord and she connects him with the Lord I mean what an incredible connection that she makes with David a sure house the parallels between Jesus Christ here are incredible and David the languages of my Lord and and the Lord Capital owl verse 29 and says yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God and The Souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling you know David right there as she said sling he remembered Goliath he remembered God in his life he remembered how God had orchestrated his very life and the God had fought his battles for him and how that his soul was bound in the bundle of in a bundle of life with the Lord of God you know can you imagine that's exactly what Abigail wanted she wanted not to be bound by this law of this husband because she wanted to be bound in the bundle of life praise the Lord oh David had she had David's attention she knew about David sling she knew about David's life amen she she knew about David and it shall come to pass in verse 30 and when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according to all the good that he had spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed the ruler over Israel I mean she is prophesying she is she is speaking the word to David I mean she's speaking what Samuel spoke see the word was in Abigail the word that was in Samuel was now coming out of Abigail's mouth praise the Lord that this shall be no grief unto thee in verse 31 no nor offense of Hearts unto my Lord neither that thou Hast shed blood causeless or that my Lord hath Avenged himself but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my Lord then remember thine handmade in other words when you come into your position remember me just like the thief on the cross amen remember me your lady and waiting Remember Me Lord oh my remember her situation now her oppression and she says when you are king and have authority and resources remember me Jesus reply was this day shall you see me in Paradise amen Jesus said it's expedient that I go to the father then he goes and he sits on the throne and sends back the Holy Ghost amen verse 32 says blessed be the Lord God for sending you to me this day Imagine David rejoicing because of Abigail now remember David's gone through an experience as well he's lost a wife also huh he's also lost a wife and he and here he is and and this woman comes to him and he says blessed art thou for coming to me this day amen something's happening he's excited he's happy amen and he thanks her from for from keeping him from shedding innocent blood verse 35 says so David received of her hand that which he had brought which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see I have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person not just heard her voice but he accepted Abigail now Abigail is under the wrong headship but her voice crying out from under that headship caught David's attention and the voice responds and he says you have found favor with me not just your voice right like the prophet says our voice crying out from the front behind the blood he cannot see us but but he hears a voice and then he says I have accepted thy person think of what he's saying he's accepted her Oh my he in other words it is to say that he has elevated her from her status from her situation Abigail I I see your need is what he's saying that you have found favor in my eyes I I'm gonna sheath the sword go in peace I'm going to elevate you you're elevated in my presence [Applause] he's going to lift her up into Heavenly places I've accepted come up higher where I am amen come out from this this Despair and this headship that you're in that brother and sister what a beautiful response from David I have accepted thy person I've received your gift and when we sing praises unto the Lord and we come here and we worship so appreciate our brother Isaac and the way he worships and just creates an atmosphere and God receives our Gifts of worship amen and there he has forgiven her and made her free from any guilt hello and yet the flash is there he hasn't changed his opinion huh he hasn't changed his opinion we don't find Abigail going home and telling you know nabel about everything and and oh that's so nice Abigail right how sweet right no oh this guy is evil he's churlish severe and she knows this but she has a promise now right she has a promise she's heard directly from David this is not through a messenger anymore this is personal she's heard directly he said Shalom to me amen when he unveiled himself the first thing he said was peace be unto your house my house not just me but my house if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ die in thy house shall be saved absolutely amen I'm just telling you what the word says amen oh but my family this I'll enable this and and and he didn't do the right thing in this oh no he said peace be unto you this to be free from any guilt he's literally telling her that I have lifted thy face [Music] now verse 36 is where it gets really really good now we're now we're getting into bear territory again amen people the theme of the services we need this thing needs to be dead it needs to be dead dead for for her to be able to change headship amen I love this because you know she didn't go home and then kill nabel right she doesn't go and murder her husband you know he's pathetic my husband's no good she doesn't you know that's verbally right you know you can kill someone verbally too right no she's trusting in the Lord so now Abigail has a secret She carries this this promise she has a secret and a heart the lord loves me I saw his countenance change you know he went from being angry to to loving me oh my you know she's carrying a little secret you see somebody who's fallen in love we see the couple here that is engaged God bless you too again amen but look at them I mean they they you know they're happy she's happy because she carries a little secret oh he likes me right it's good I mean she's gone from having this this world of confusion and being beaten and being having a severe headship and this loneliness to oh somebody actually appreciates my cooking someone appreciates my love and and my wisdom and my beauty appreciates who I am Hallelujah he carries this little secret back home can you imagine coming back into this Palace this great place of riches and all things and when she saw it all she could see was the hand of judgment over this building but yet for her and her house there was a safe place there was a place of Refuge amen oh she's carrying a little secret it doesn't matter what's happening out there in the world it doesn't matter that Saul is running after David and all this stuff is happening and David's been rejected he's gonna become king one day but in the meantime there's a little woman who's been waiting Hallelujah and she's going to be married to that King [Music] oh we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye when this Mortal will be shed my brother and sister will receive a new robe Hallelujah now Abigail returns home you find Dave I'm feeling good I I hope we're okay this morning brother thank you all right man I'm just I've got nowhere else to be so I'm just enjoying myself this morning amen Abigail returns home to find naval drunk in a big feast you know Naval is so unaware of what's going on but they're drunk in their face like Pentecost drunk in their feast but unaware of what's happening the judgment is coming and unaware that there's a secret with Abigail oh this is beautiful Abigail's carrying a secret she's got a mystery this Feast was a great feast Fit For A King she comes home in the evening time it's perfect how this how this all works out here and she does not tell him what she has done she also doesn't tell him about the dialogue between what of what she's had between her and David see in the evening it's a secret it's a mystery there's so many stories we could bring into this but just follow me through here so she's waiting in other words she's carrying this mystery it's evening time she comes home right into the very place that's going to be judged and she's and she's living in this environment but everything's different now because she has a promise directly from David but it's a secret to her see she's not interested in what Naval is going to say she knows how nabel is going to respond so she's holding the secret she holds This Promise she has faith in what what God might do for her but see she waits until the morning light until the rising of the Sun that's when everything is going to be exposed that's where everything's going to change for Abigail so through this evening time she's carrying this mystery the secret and and she's waiting for the morning sun to come amen when that sun rises in the East again amen that one final time amen is going to change her situation amen she knows that when that sun rises again when the Sun rises upon the word that's been given to her there'll be a quickening there'll be a change in her environment thank you [Music] and it's in the morning when the mystery is made plain it's in the morning when when maybe navel wakes up a little bit and he stirs out of his Slumber and his partying and and unaware of of his of what has happened and he starts to kind of you know be aware of hey what's what's going on you know Abigail where have you been you know where have you been oh man we could tell stories of where we have been my brothers we've been with the Lord we've been with David you know we've been with his mighty men we've been with his Messengers oh let me tell you nabel of what what David has told me you see she's stuck to Naval still at this point oh my God Abigail starts to tell Mabel the secret starts to put the flesh under submission amen starts to unveil no no navel you know you might feel that way but but this is what David said you know you might say that about me but David he liked me David loves me oh man and then and then Naval might say something about David it's not true and you know he's a runaway and he's this and that and look at all the mistakes that David has made and she doesn't care because she's safe she saw she saw his weapons she saw his sword amen she saw his shield she knows what's coming because she's been given a preview of the Judgment that's coming but she's as she knows she's safe from all those things she does not care what David said what Mabel is saying anymore it doesn't matter my brother and sister because she knows who David really is she knows there's coming a season when David Will Rule and Reign Over everything [Music] so as she starts to tell her flesh the secret in other words when when she started to resist the devil right when she started to take the word and start talking to her flesh with a word that was given to her that I'm free nabel you're in big trouble you're in big trouble Mabel he's coming for you amen but I've I'm isolated from your trouble huh I'm free he told me that there's only peace for me I'm not gonna Taste of any of his wrath the naval you are in so much trouble I'm so thankful but you know our flesh really has done a number on us eh this flesh you're in trouble faith and you're in trouble man huh you're in big trouble he's coming huh the the Rangers coming Hallelujah and as she starts to confess the word ask your stars to confess the promise something changes let's turn over to Navel now Naval is hearing Abigail's revelation and the Bible tells us that his heart died within him I love that Nable did not have to that Abigail did not have to do anything to nabel she just had to wait and trust in the Lord but Mabel's heart died within him in other words something suddenly changed because before Naval might have hit her huh he might have put her under his thumb and tried to bring her to submission Abigail who are you kidding you're not worthy David doesn't like you you know nothing you're stuck with me you know he could have he could have tried to bring her under subjection again and and our flesh can do that by memories or whatever but you see something different was happening now amen I'm so thankful amen the Bible tells us that he became as a stone in other words with her new revelation with her understanding of who she was to David he became unresponsive your flesh literally like like a brother was saying you know we don't have we we don't have the desire for sin this flesh just we don't have a desire for it it's unresponsive it's become a stone in other words he became senseless he had he had no ability to influence her anymore [Music] he was not being able to react he's not able to react to what she's saying he hears the message of peace and long-suffering and salvation he doesn't know what to do with that in other words he has been made powerless in the presence of the word but I want you to notice this Abigail's words that is making him powerless this this bride will have a Ministry my brother and sister at the end time and that enemy will be made powerless in her presence [Applause] powerless powerless by Abigail's confession you know this is important because we're leaving camp are we gonna go home we're going to go to school we're going to go to work go to all these places and your flesh is going to rile up remember me right this habit that feeling this that just confess the word just speak the word speak the word you'll see that that enemy will become powerless he won't know how to react to you he'll he'll wonder what has happened to you Hallelujah but he's not dead yet but he's powerless I love this you see a headship that was taking Abigail to certain death has now been made powerless over her in other words the the grip of death the the Paws Of The Lion and the bear have been removed from Abigail's life the Bible tells us that the Lord smote nabel 10 days later and nabel was dead can you say that navel is dead amen you see God saw Abigail's need he had a Warrior come on the scene he had Messengers come on the scene but God was waiting for Abigail to take the word and speak it to her need whatsoever you say then okay you ask anything in my name believing it shall be given he's waiting for you to say it and then God makes that enemy powerless in our lives and you know she may have walked Pastor a few times during the week can you imagine this guy that was cruel that was severe and she would come into His presence and maybe kind of hunk her a little bit you know just not knowing how he's going to respond or what he's going to do and living fear in her whole life like that and but now you know because of her confession she was becoming stronger she could walk into his room and he'd still be there like he was saying like a mannequin you would still be there just speechless nothing to say just a stone and she would maybe go up to him and poke him a little bit you know man that desire of smoking where is it gone huh that desire for drinking where's it gone or remove movies whatever it may be my brother and sister you know you know what I'm talking about this morning but you know that it's gone maybe maybe you know you just walked past him one day and just give him a little shove huh it's powerless you know maybe she would maybe she would start to realize what's happening and and bring her children you know bring her servants and her family and say hey I want to show you guys something we're going to go to church today I want to show you something amen hallelujah amen our enemy's dead that that headship that I was bound to that's oppressive thing that was holding me under that he's dead he's unresponsive he's senseless you know I can walk right up to him and say something and and he just stares into Abyss just nothing there huh praise the Lord she must be she must have been having a jubilee amen and then her her mind starts to turn heavenward oh my because now she's free now she's free to go and and marry this one this one who brought protection her whole life I want you to remember that while Abigail was under those circumstances David was protecting her also all our lives he has been faithful [Applause] [Music] but there Comes A Time my brother and sister where he doesn't want to just protect us from afar he doesn't want to just you know set a hedge around us no he wants to walk with you isn't that exactly what he did with the prophet he said he welcomed him back into that storm in his life and he said come back into the storm and he and he speaks to that storm and then after a little while he says he started to feel young again huh and he said he found a hand on him and he says you're walking with the King [Music] that's what he wants to do with you and me my brothers and citizenship with you he wants to be your headship amen my brown sister this headship brings all the benefits it brings protection it's it brings all the the necessary food that we have need on for for our journey it brings peace brings Joy and he's going to be king one day [Music] [Applause] oh I just love the story of Abigail [Music] we find in the next little bit here how David proposes see Catch the sequence now David's first wife Michael or Michelle however you say that was taken from him to be given to another so Abigail comes on the scene at this that's why I say the timing of all of this is so incredible is to give us confidence this morning David's available David is looking for a wife and you're available amen God's taking care of all those issues he's taking care of the flesh he's taking care of the law David's first wife given to another and Abigail's husband dies made powerless over her David immediately turns to her and sends her Messengers Messengers that tells her of David's intentions towards her and in the words of the Scripture it says that David sent and communed with Abigail in this communion phase of our walk with the Lord amen and he communes with her to let her know that he is coming to take her to be his wife verse 40 says and when the Servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel they spake unto her saying David sent on sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife and she arose and bowed her head herself on her face to the Earth about herself on her face to the Earth and said behold let thine handmade be a servant to wash the feet of the Servants of my Lord oh she was happy she was rejoicing remember the woman that lost Jesus feet why because of that defeat of Jesus remember it's under those feet where every enemy is crushed feet of breath we said oh my brother and sister feet of pillar is a fire there's so many beautiful things we could draw out here remember where was where was Ruth's time of safety where was Ruth's position in the harvest season it was at boaz's feet and she goes and Bows herself and humbles itself it comes down to wash the servant's feet and it says in verse 42 and Abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers of David and he and became his wife musicians can come praise the Lord see we have a modern-day Abigail also remember the woman that had the drunk husband God got a hold of him because God was fighting her battles what about the woman of Samaria you see now now we can come and we can take all these stories and we can go from Romans 7. and we can go to Romans 8. and it starts a whole new chapter in The Eighth Day amen and what does it say there is therefore now now no condemnation [Applause] we're free from the law the Abigail was free from the law of her old husband praise the Lord free from condemnation free from guilt free from that oppression free from his influences [Music] we'll go back to Romans 7 and just close with with us Romans 7 and verse 4. and I trust that the story has just brought some insight to this because sometimes we read these things and we hear about laws and husbands and all these things and it's hard to really relate what God has really done for us in our day right now I'm not talking about just 2 000 years ago my brother and sister I'm talking about right now what God is doing for us Romans 7 and 4 says wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ what is the body of Christ the word that you should be married to another he made a way of Escape even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sins which were by the lauded work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death this is where Abigail was she was under that law and because of that law of the flesh the Motions of sins which were by the law see it couldn't do anything else that's all it knew how to do is bring oppression it couldn't bring her to Christ could only show her her weaknesses and that's what the law did only showed our weak spots our insufficiency [Music] verse 6 says but now but now we are delivered from the law in other words we're free [Music] that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter what can we say to these things we're free amen let's Stand Together amen praise the Lord let's sing the song that they're playing Amazing Grace
