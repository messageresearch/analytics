or streaming may be their portion may your spirit be so with them lord and may you take your word and anchor it into our souls and may it bring forth a hundred fold you see every need lord behind

they might be starting a new school like high school or intermediate wherever wherever they're going oh god may you anoint them may you keep them lord may give them discernment between right and wrong and may they not be caught up in man's praise and trying to please people but lord man they just want to please you and love you and may they just be bright shining lights wherever they are grounded for your glory we commit them into your hands which one also prayers are about to read your holy word lord i pray you just anointed and may you make it live in our lives for your glory we commit the service and the day into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen we want to go to the book of ezekiel again we're just going to read the same portion of scripture and then we're going to go to daniel 11 as well in verse 32 we're going to continue on from there so ezekiel 36 and verses 24 to 28 we're going to read that and then we're going to go to daniel 11 and 32 again probably one of my favorite scriptures of daniel 11 32 to be part of that verse amen amen i trust everyone's well and happy today amen now ezekiel 36 and we're going to read from verse 24 again for i'll take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land then will i sprinkle clean water upon you you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you a new spirit will i put within you and i'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you a heart of flesh and i'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god amen and then daniel 11 and verse 32 just want to welcome my dads is here today as well amen praise the lord mum's here too but she's staying with christine and the children so but yeah um it's great to have them down here always a wonderful privilege to have them so deuteronomy 11 and 32 um we're here and we're just gonna realize the second part of this sorry deuteronomy did i say that dan thank you very much i'm glad you're that that wasn't a drill i was gonna read deuteronomy 11. yeah i'm glad i'm glad everyone's awake i don't need to say anything about about the clothes yet good now daniel 11 and 32 says here and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people now he's talking about you and i but the people that know their god shall be strong and do exploits hallelujah i like that they shall be strong it's not they might be they will be they shall be like i think brother paul said on wednesday shall is a lot stronger than you will amen shall amen so you may be seated this morning god bless you may the lord bless the reading of his word i'd like to continue on so i've got a few uh i just trust this comes out right because you just think about just the power of the the potency of the word of god in this last days where god is bringing your people to the full manifestation you know today you know now we are the sons of god not we'll we'll be one day right today we are the sons of god and i want to so we went last sunday we went through the process of of god removing the stony heart so you know that stony heart you can't get nowhere with god you know your human reasoning is exalted above the word of god but then he gives you a heart of flesh so your heart is you can be molded and shaped by the word of god you believe yes the word is true but then he gives you a new spirit because you can't even you know with the spirit you're born with you know you can't even get along with yourself or your neighbor or your family where you're fighting fussing whatever more and he gives you a new spirit he delivers you from smoking drinking habits of the world whatever it is but that but that's not the final end is that then he puts his spirit within the middle of that new spirit and by the holy ghost within you he causes you to walk in his word amen so what a tremendous power that is when we realize when we've received the holy ghost as jesus is the christian on the inside of us it's not us trying to be a christian us trying to live the christian life but he is the christian on the inside of us but then he says and you shall dwell in the land of your fathers so you will return back to the land of your fathers now we know when we speak of land here we're not speaking of a physical geographical location uh in the old testament we understand that it was speaking of the promised land but the old testament is a shadow of the new and so we know that the land that is spoken of here is actually the baptism of the holy ghost the promises we have in the lord as the apostle paul would take he would parallel the journey that israel would have in hebrews three and four he will i know you know these things but i just want to keep it in front of you because many people they think well the old testament it's all past is there's no point reading it no more it doesn't apply but the apostle paul would tell timothy that all scripture is inspired for doctrine for correction for reproof all scripture i mean so he did not say just the new testament now he says no all scripture so all scripture applies and we can see in the old testament as the shadow and the new testament is the reality so where ezekiel is saying you shall dwell in the land of your fathers he's saying that you shall return to a place where your fathers dwelt and they occupied and so now we're living in a time where the land that we've returned to is entering into christ in reality where we're no longer just going to church and going through the motions but you really meet the lord you enter into a new dwelling place and then you enter into a new you enter into into an eternal rest amen so so so the land that our fathers dwelt in is is the original pentecostal book of acts land i mean of the holy ghost this is where he says you shall dwell he's not saying that you'll dwell in another place or a modern kind of trend of the way he says no you will dwell in the land of your fathers i mean so if we look into the land of our fathers we can see the power of god living in their lives i mean it wasn't just a new religious thought it wasn't just changing their religious um you know religious belief system but it was a birth into a kingdom i mean it was a transforming power came into their lives and changed their thinking change their outlook changed their nature amen where peter was once a cow that ran from from the testimony of a woman and some other people when he was you know out of you're outside jesus and pilate's judgment hall he's warming himself by the fire and people come to him one after aren't you one of them aren't you an apostle uh you know even your speech your you know your accent betrays you're a galilean and he would deny the lord thrice as the lord told them to do but just that little bit of pressure he ran he cursed and denied the lord so he needed he needed to enter into this land and so when he entered into this land he could stand boldly on the day of pentecost and preach the first ever church service you have crucified the very messiah you know and you know he would he would he would preach that and then he would stand before the sanhedrin and he wasn't bowed by them where before a few days before that he was he was bowed just by a man or a woman giving ask him aren't you one of them but now he's standing before the same ones that crucified the messiah he says what shall we do should we please god or man you tell us amen and and you know he was beaten they just went away rejoicing i mean the more they are afflicted they just praise god hallelujah so why because so this is the land of our fathers where they would not bow or compromise amen to the popular opinion of the day they stay true to the word hallelujah you see signs wonders miracles done that was the land they dwelt in amen hallelujah now we'll probably go into that at another time but that's a yo we live in a powerful amazing place the believer does right now amen it's just not a place of theology it's not a place of just reasoning amen but it's almighty god pouring himself into you and i that his word is manifested out of our lives hallelujah amen so now if we're going to dwell on that land now if the land is christ which it is the anointed word that lives in us then we we we will be his people amen we're not a different people we become his people now what i love about the you know the plan of redemption where god in his great grace you know actually allowed the jews to be blinded that we could come in where originally we were not part of the original covenant we weren't we didn't even come into the equation but where god is there is always a way of grace to whosoever will and so he allowed he allowed the jews to be blinded that us gentiles who weren't even in his covenant could come in hallelujah you know he would he would be he would allow himself to be forsaken by the ones he was meant to come to that you and i could have a chance amen and you know when it's all said and done and the jews eyes come open it'll be like it'll be like joseph and his brethren when joseph reveals himself to his brethren and they're crying out this great wailing and going on they've realized that the one that they sold as a slave the one they hated and despised and were jealous i mean was the very one that saved their lives and now had revealed them reveal themselves to them and he said don't be angry don't be sad god allowed this that life would be preserved amen so one day the very one that they said crucify him away with this man they'll realize he was the very one that would deliver them the very one that was their messiah and he would say don't cry no more it's all over you did this your forebears did this that life could be saved and the life that he saved it wasn't just some abstract person so it was me hallelujah it was you it was me amen god allowed that for me to come in hallelujah amen where paul would write in romans 9 if you want to put it up romans 9 and 23 he says he says this here we should never let these things come common we live in a great land a land flowing with milk and honey a land flowing with healing and deliverance amen a peace that passes understanding amen we're a real shepherd dwells amen that'll guide you through the darkest of ours where you don't know the way to go he knows the way he'll lead you through that way you may think all is lost but he says nothing's lost amen i'll see you through just keep your eyes on the shepherd keep your eyes on the word you may say that there's no hope yes there's hope amen with the lord there's always hope hallelujah we have a we have a real shepherd amen he's not a hiring that quits when stuff gets tough and hard no he's among his sheep he's among his sheep this morning i mean he's with you in the storm don't ever think he's too far away don't ever think he's forgotten you he can't forget israel i mean he can't forget you he says even a woman that's had a child can forget a child but i cannot forget you and i don't understand how a woman could ever forget having birthing a child to the earth he says yet it's possible but yet i cannot forget amen romans 9 and 23 and that he may make known unto the sorry and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had for prepared unto glory he's talking about you are you a vessel of mercy this morning i mean that's what you've been made for that's why you've been fashioned for irrespective of your troubles and you may hate your own personality and you don't fit in different things but you're still a vessel prepared for mercy you're not a vessel made for wrath amen hallelujah even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also the gentiles as he saith also an osi which is hosea i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved she should say this morning i'm beloved i'm his beloved hallelujah once upon a time i wasn't but now i am i mean by the blood of jesus christ i'm his beloved i mean all of his love has been poured out upon me i mean not just some trinkling gift like some girlfriend he's flirting with no his wife all that he is he's poured in i mean all of heaven is behind you all the jesus is behind you hallelujah he's not just putting you on some limb somewhere seeing if he'll make it through he's determined i remember the people that know their god shall be strong and do exploits you say i'm weak in faith no the word says you're strong you shall be strong hallelujah amen and her beloved wishes not beloved and it shall come to pass that in that place where it was said unto them they are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living god hallelujah so we were so once upon a time we were not his people but god and his grateful knowledge says they shall be my people i'll take a people that would ever part of the covenant or the promises and they shall be my people and i will be their god hallelujah this is part of being in the land of our fathers amen amen hallelujah now this word dwell this is going back to ezekiel where we read here in verse 28 now this word dwell has a very rich and diverse meaning if you look in the strong's concordance it means properly it means it means to sit down specifically as judge in ambush and quiet now we could spend some time here so we're here to judge because every it's it because what are we to judge judge righteous judgment that's not judgment jesus said judge not lest you be judged right that means judgment to condemnation but he also says judge righteous judgment he won't say two things that conflict you need the understanding that's why people say oh don't judge jesus said don't judge they don't have the understanding because that's why if he said that and he meant it that way he would never have said judge righteous judgment right so we've been given discernment to judge between right and wrong to judge between right and nearly right right remember eve the whole world fell into this sin trap that we're in because the serpent the devil anointed the serpent and he changed the scripture just by one word or two it was mostly truth so it was nearly right but it was wrong right but we we if we have the mind of christ today if you have the holy truly have the holy ghost you have the mind of christ the mind of the word then you can judge amen you can judge between right and nearly right not just right and wrong amen and then so to sit down especially as judge we have to judge the devil a liar oh don't be against the no no we're against the devil the prophet says he hates me and i hate him we're allowed to hate someone that's the devil we don't hate people right we never hold anything against a person it's a spirit in the person that's the bad thing right so we have to be able to judge him a liar where's that thought coming from that makes you feel withdrawn and down and depressed that's not god filling your mind with that you're gonna be able to judge where the thought comes from it should be able to come through a filter is this drawing me closer to the lord is it making me love her more does it make me love my brothers and sisters more does it make me appreciate them more or does it make me feel withdrawn and i don't fit that second part is not god we should be able to judge those things in ambush we ambush the devil quite regularly he gets ambushed in church he comes along thinking that he's going to take over and just the whole thing's going to go to nothing but then the god sets a trap where we're going to praise god god comes down he gets cast out there's an ambush going on maybe i shouldn't have told him that but he's been in too many of them but he's a creature of habit he never learns from his mistakes amen now by implication this word dwell uh by obligation to dwell means to remain you're going to remain in this place you're not going to be cast away speaking of being if you're sealed into the holy ghost you can't be unsealed right this is the land we dwell in um it's cause actively it's to settle or to marry hallelujah so there's gonna be a uniting you're gonna dwell in this land there's gonna be uniting in this land it's not just uh well i'm just living here and taking occupying time in this this religion no no you're being united hallelujah being united not to a church not to a religious thought not to a bunch of doctrine this is not what this is about it's being united to the resurrected lord jesus christ the living word paulus he says you shall dwell here you shall get married in this land hallelujah there's a uniting i'm doing this because i want you see you're not one and not two you become one and between you and god there's no separation you actually just merging to the other if i could do that i could that my fingers stick together and they become one finger because you and god become one hallelujah so it means to it means to marry so there's a uniting going on in this land amen hallelujah now brother brown would preach invisible union of the bride as a thanksgiving message he comes down towards the end of his message and he and he and and he says well you may say what has all this got to do with thanksgiving what you talking about brother branham it's quarter to nine you didn't say nothing about thanksgiving he says what a message for the occasion to me yes indeed he says the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for the newfound way of life that's the ones that came from the old world and they came to america being separated from the old english denominations and creed they could marry to the new anointed word of their age that's right the new anointed word of their age for their day i mean so we can be thankful as pilgrims like abraham separated ourselves from all things of the world all of our associates abraham was a pilgrim god had separated us from all the dead religions i'm speaking across the nation now all the dead creeds to what separate us and open to us a new land a new message for this day so he says that the pilgrim fathers they left their old all the all the oppression of the old world's religious systems and they came to a new world to be united to the word i mean because they came for freedom of religion that's why they moved if i can say that word they just move across the atlantic and they settled right so we can rejoice as well because we have left unbelief we have left unbelief in the word we have left reasoning against the word we have left the world right we have left its systems we've left it's religion it may be atheism as gnosticism whatever ism we left it he says you don't you're not meant to dwell in those things you're not meant to dwell in some formal religious setting that's not your dwelling place i want to marry you i want to unite myself with you i'm going to bring you to this land bring you into the holy ghost that you'd be united with me hallelujah so we can say what a thanksgiving this is not thanksgiving actually every day is a thanksgiving when you meet the lord jesus christ every day is a thanksgiving thank you lord for saving me thank you lord for making me whole thank you lord for healing my broken spirit thank you lord for guiding me thank you lord for teaching me thank you lord for keeping me in the way thank you lord for saving me thank you lord for washing me of all my past i have no baggage it got destroyed hallelujah you know i don't know anyone who's ever traveled through an airport and been rejoicing that their baggage got lost you never see happy people at the baggage claim counter hello how are you i've been on a flight for 58 hours and my baggage isn't here i'm so happy today i've never seen that it's always frowns and you know but they traveled from one place to another and their baggage got lost sometimes it doesn't turn back up again you know i remember we flew this is where my parents were in american samoa and it was like this pencil plane from american samoa to western somalia to get a plane to new zealand you had to get weighed yourself to be allocated on this pencil plane it wasn't just the baggage you got way because i had to divvy up the weight and one time i flew into up here and um no i oh i think maybe it was when we checked and wherever it's like where's my bag oh you'll get it the next day i'll turn up to new zealand the next day that's my whole life in that bag all my clothes all i was was in that bag and uh and and he just said no it'll it'll come later thank you it was not the next day's a few days after that but you know in case of being a believer the lord gets a hold of you you move you get translated into the kingdom of his dear son by the blood of jesus christ you're once in one place in sin thinking you were the king and you knew what you were doing you had it all figured out and man had the best opinion and this is you know there's nothing to it to god or whatever more but then god said no no you're not meant to be there i'm going to move you i've even given you a passport to travel hallelujah you may not have realized it but you had it in your face to travel amen and then but then in the process of moving when you get to this new land there's no baggage claim counter because it gets destroyed it's not just left behind it's gone amen in the blood of jesus christ hallelujah so this kind of travel it's good when your baggage goes missing and we don't go claiming it either who wants their pass back i'm glad people are a bit quicker off the trigger this sunday oh they're paying attention yes see because the blood takes care of it doesn't just cover it up it's not just putting a back shed of god's memory and then pulled out when it's inconvenient no the blood annihilates it it's gone where did it go there's like you had a lot of baggage it's in the blood the seed of his forgetfulness and the scripture says that the sea is so deep even the adders can't get down to the bottom of it so the devil can't even he may try and swim in there he can't get down to where it is it's gone he'll just drown himself hopefully blow up with the pressure you know why not let them implode down there in the darkness see you later bye you know so we can rejoice talk about a thanksgiving amen we've been moved hallelujah and the baggage of sin and our past is gone it may be in our minds but you got to remember we we cannot we should not let a memory torment us i mean we should not let a memory torment us even though maybe the emotion comes back it's so real and no it's been done it's been dealt with holy just like the israelites after they crossed the red sea they were still carrying slave yo whip marks scars on their backs and maybe maybe when they saw them or felt them or saw them on maybe their loved ones that maybe could have brought the emotion back of of of the beatings and the trauma but then they then those let their mind wander a bit further where they came to a sea and they thought we're actually going to get massacred and god brought them there because god wanted to destroy their baggage their baggage was alive their tormentors were very much alive but he wanted them dead amen so he brought them there and he had moses raise up his staff and the sea parted and they journeyed over and it wasn't just for them to journey over and then the cedar you know it closed in the egyptians be on the one side no no god set up an ambush hallelujah we think the devil's on our case it's actually an ambush against him i mean you have trouble in your life a spirit troubling you it's actually an ambush that that thing's going to be killed out of your life i mean then they cross the israelites cross and the devil thinks i can cross too if they can do it i can do it and he comes to the right part of the sea and god just says raise your staff and then the sea comes over them and they all drown hallelujah and it's like your sin and the blood of jesus christ amen you should be able to stand on the riverbank and look back and see your dead sin drowned in the blood of jesus christ hallelujah it's dead it's gone hallelujah and so all you can be tormented by now is a memory but remember the devil always says remember this bit the most traumatic painful bit you say no devil devil let's just fast for the tape this much because this is where the torment pain happened but this is where you got drowned hallelujah and then what's the next part of that me rejoicing over your defeat hallelujah let's just let's just replay that bit a whole bunch sit here satan i'll give you some popcorn watch this you know he remembers it you need to remind him though because he's nothing but a bluff amen you've got to remind the devil that he got defeated that day hallelujah amen because we've got to remind satan we need to if you have no one to testify to and you're feeling down testify to the devil say devil you're giving me this you're you're making me feel this way so i'm going to tell you a few things hallelujah there's a time you know that time you you once ruled my life but i gave my life to the lord jesus christ and you got dethroned and then to show you and all of hell and all of heaven whose side i'm on i went and got baptized in the name of my redeemer the lord jesus christ i took on a new name do you remember that day i do it was great hallelujah i even got a video look what happened hallelujah amen and do you remember satan amen where where there was that meeting i was in and god filled me with the holy ghost changed me forever you remember that day you got sealed out and i got sealed into the kingdom hallelujah i tell you what you just start to remind the devil of all the things god has done for you you won't be sad anymore hallelujah amen so we can rejoice because we have been united amen to the lord jesus christ just like he said the pilgrim fathers could be united i mean to the anointed word for their age which is the lord jesus so we can say what a thanksgiving i mean we have been united to the living word in this day remember jesus is the word he's not just like you know the girls watch um they used to watch a lot of they still do but you know like children's cartoon um christian cartoon stories of the bible on youtube and jesus is like this hippie guy walking on the shores of galilee oh come here that's all right yeah love everyone you know but there's just one very one dimension like this hippie laid back jesus i don't think he's necessarily all that way all the time but we're not just united too but many people say oh i'm united to that guy and here's the word there but this is the word here you can't you can't divide jesus in the word because they are the same amen so there's a uniting that's a writer jesus is the word why we we want to become one with the word amen amen and so in the old testament this was shown now i um i have the uh where where the apostle paul speaks about in hebrews chapter 9 if you want to put up hebrews 9 and 17 but it's in the book of exodus where where after after moses received the law and he read it to the people he took the blood of bulls and goats and he sprinkled the book and he sprinkled the people and he sprinkled all of the um oh let's just read it here hebrews uh sorry uh verse 17. we go down to verse 17 of hebrews 9. for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the test data liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of cows and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you he says moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission so he read the law the word if i can do this and he took the blood and the and this and you know the different elements he mixed them together and he sprinkled the people and the word with the blood saying that this blood actually unites you with the word right so now you're not two separate entities you're one right there's a uniting by the blood by the blood of the lamb i could say it like this they were united with the word this was done in type i mean to show what the lord jesus would do in this day now the thing is not not everyone so so they were now meant to embody that word right so their very life was meant to be a manifestation of the scripture amen but the thing is not everyone mix that word with faith as as uh paul would say in hebrews four and one and two he says let us therefore fearless the promise being left of of us of entering into his rest as any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel priest as well as unto them but the word preached to not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so they were all sprinkled but it was only those who had a heart of faith manifested it right now faith and human reasoning can't mix faith real faith is revelation of the word of god it goes beyond human reasoning right human reasoning doesn't cannot come into the equation because the 12 spies that moses first sent out they were they were in this event where the where the book was sprinkled with the blood and the people sprinkled that same blood to enjoying it together but only two of those spies mix that word with faith caleb and joshua and the other ten spies they they saw the same land they saw the same giants they saw the same walls they saw the same armies they saw the same everything caleb and joshua didn't just go to some little village in the back of a valley somewhere and say this is the land we'll take it look this is what i saw no no they saw all and they did not disqualify the testimony of the other spies when they came back but they said god is more than able for us to take it let's go get it now why because because the word was joined to them by the blood but it was mixed with faith so they believed that word right it was revealed to them that the lord was going to manifest that word in their lives and part of that word was they would dwell in the land i mean so so their reasoning their reasoning did not get in the way well their reasoning didn't even come into the equation because their faith said it's mine amen now reasoning we must be careful because reasoning can just be a thin veneer of unbelief right because but the thing is if you think about it if we were transported back into caleb and joshua's day and we asked those ten spies do you believe in jehovah god absolutely that's his prophet there moses i'll tell you about the red sea i walked through it you should have heard the day when the death angel came through i was there i was safe because i applied the blood we've been eating manna of course i believe he's a god of miracles but their faith wasn't it was just human faith it wasn't revealed faith because when the first obstacle came along of can you believe the word they reasoned it away saying we're just grasshoppers and as i've said before they didn't go they didn't knock on the doors of jericho or malachite stronghold and say can you have you got five minutes to fill out a survey are we a in your site the same size are we b taller than you or we see about grasshopper level they didn't ask them that i know it sounds ridiculous but they didn't go ask them how are we compared to you can you stand who will measure you and you measure us and all that's that's that's that's grasshopper range no they just reason that that we're just little in there so we're grasshoppers but caleb and joshua they believed they said we're more than able to take the land and so because faith and human reasoning can't mix they had to surrender their reasoning and take faith right so they had to surrender their reasoning against the word and to say no god said it's gonna be amen and that's how we should be today no they were united so so in shadow there or in type moses sprinkled the people of the book and the people with the blood both he says this is what god has enjoined he enjoined the people in the word now this was done in the old testament under the blood of bulls and goats but it could not write that word in their hearts so the same sinful desire that they that caused them to sin in the first place and they took the offering to the to the priest then they were forgiven you know the blood covered that sin they still left with that same desire but under the blood of jesus christ by the holy ghost god burns out that old nature he burns out those old desires he doesn't just suppress the member now this is christianity is not how to suppress your carnal nature and look like a christian 12 steps no it's god comes in and changes our nature right we really are born again we really do become new creatures he really does transform us hallelujah so it's not seven or twelve or whatever many steps to suppress your carnal nature to be a christian it's not that way it's god comes and changes your nature hallelujah amen so the apostle paul was saying in second corinthians three and one i trust everyone i'm about to climb everyone's awake everyone's doing okay yep god praise the lord amen second corinthians three and one the apostle paul would speak about how they actually the people the believers be became living epistles just as you could say in shadow caleb and joshua became living epistles because they said caleb said i want my mountain he got his mountain amen they took the land hallelujah what did they do they they they manifested the word the word was living in them remember because the old testament law was not made for the wilderness it was made for the promised land the whole purpose of it was to be in the land not to be in the wilderness and it's the same thing with the word of god the whole purpose of it is for the holy ghost to write it in your heart right to be in the land to dwell to be united to the lord he says do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you you are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ minister by us not by not written not sorry with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart so the apostle paul was telling them actually you are living epistles right written not by inc so not by man's ability not by trying to memorize it in the mind all those things are fine but it was by the holy ghost taking the word and writing it into the hearts of the people they became living bibles right why because they were dwelling now in a new land amen they had been united now if we have been united to the king it's fundamental that we take his name amen right it's very fundamental because if we are if you know if we go to ephesians i believe it's chapter three if i have it here if not well i'll turn to it yeah ephesians 3 and we're going to go to um ephesians 3 and 9 because remember we want to well we must be united to the king of this land right who wants to become one with jesus right so here we are in ephesians three and we're going to start from verse nine it's hard yeah i love the book of ephesians so it's kind of hard to just read a bit okay ephesians three and nine and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places maybe might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore i desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named so what's the family name the lord jesus christ right jesus said i come in my father's name and you receive me not what name did he come in jesus right so the family name is jesus right so the inhabitants of this land is called the lord jesus christ amen amen that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit and the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god now unto him that's able to do exceeding abundant above all that you may ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen i mean so the family name as as we have established is the lord jesus christ and this is why when the when when peter would preach on the day of pentecost and and they were pricked in their hearts realizing they crucified the messiah they asked they asked the disciples men and brethren what shall we do to be saved and so here here is peter he's preaching the first ever service it's not even peter preaching it's actually jesus by the way within and preaching he says repent every one of you and then yeah for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so the promise is unto you and your children those that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call right so so this was this was he said you've got to repent so you've got to lay aside all of your sin lay aside your reasoning lay aside your religion lay aside your baggage lay aside your guilt lay them all put them at jesus feet turn from them and be buried in his name amen in baptism see there is one door into heaven that's through the lord jesus christ he says i'm the door to the sheepfold we know in the old testament sheepfolds didn't have doors the shepherd was the door to the sheepfold so at night when the shepherd led his sheep into the sheepfold he actually lay across the opening of the of the sheepfold and he became the door amen and jesus is the door right so if we want to enter into the sheepfold we have to we have to come his provided way now i'm telling you these things because when the devil comes away and tries to say you ain't gonna make it you say devil hold on i'm going to give you a history lesson hallelujah so it's very important to keep these things in our forefront because we must remember we are safe because we've come god's provided away right more than an anointing more than a feeling more than i was having some sort of nirvana kind of experience or i was down or whatever it's not based on feeling it's based on i've come according to god's word amen because that's how that's how god god is not going to judge us even by our sincerity he's going to judge us by us coming his way amen you know if a doctor said listen you have this almond in your body you've got to drink this it's been proven we can have a whole bunch of testimonies of people who have taken this medicine you know and they could say it worked for them right if i don't actually take the medicine it's not the doctor's fault for prescribing it it's not the medicine's fault either it's me choosing not to take it right so it's the same thing with salvation it can be it can be presented to us because we could look at let's look at all the patients that have taken the prescription let's let's let's ask the apostle paul how did that prescription go for you he says well i was a pharisee of the pharisees i was hell-bent against the sect of jesus of nazareth this cult and i was going to destroy it but the very god i thought i was serving revealed himself to me on the road to damascus and said my name is jesus and then i i had to repent i was baptized in his name i got filled with the holy ghost and the very thing i was trying to destroy i gave my whole life to build and then it finally came down to the crunch you know what i loved about wednesday brother paul paul and silas were in the jail they did not know they'd be set free they did not know you know brother silas yes brother paul you know brother silas if we begin to sing god's going to shake this place we're going to be set free yes yes that's that's exactly why we're going to sing because we're going to be free you know no they did not sing and praise god because of freedom they praise him because he was their god and he was their everything and they were saved it didn't matter if they rotted in that prison and died i mean they knew where they were going you know it's amazing when paul was standing before king of king agrippa and chains who was really the one in chains it wasn't the apostle paul he was a free man there was no sin debt there was no baggage that would you know stop him getting into heaven that was done with it was king agrippa king agrippa was on trial that day it wasn't the apostle paul if we looked at the natural scene to be no no um the apostle paul's on trial no no no no king agrippa was on trial because he was he was a living epistle standing before him and he was because remember the apostle paul he had eternal life he's passed from judgment but now here's his here's actually the word examining the king agrippa are you going to receive me not the just i'm not talking about the man talking about the word right and it was you know it's just like when the apostles were you know brought before the sanhedrin it was a sanhedrin on trial do you know they got a lot of times at mercy they had jesus before them the very king of glory they had the apostles more than once before them most people only get one opportunity they had about three they turned it down every time that was their decision but so you see it's not actually you're gonna think the work we are free people hey who's free the blood has loosed you amen from every debt every guilt all shame all bad memories all bad experiences religious not religious whatever it's all been taken care of i mean there's not just a little bit of us that's oh you know no no it's gone amen hallelujah irrespective of what the devil tries to put down your throat he said no no no my perfect lamb was received his name is jesus hallelujah so so there was king agrippa and it was the apostle paul actually was the free man in that in that trial no here's paul and silas they didn't know they were going to be freed but they just worshipped because they worshipped because god is so good holy they're in stocks they've been beaten but god is so good hallelujah you may be having a bad day but god is so good you may be having a lot of trouble but god is so good god rich in mercy not just to anyone but to you hallelujah we should be excited shouldn't we be happy the world's falling apart that's okay god's got this god's got us in the palm of his hand hallelujah we can just rest amen so i love that very much they just praise god and god just said i'm gonna let you out of this they weren't meant to stay there that's fine remember the trial you're in don't don't just believe you're in it forever right there's an end there's an end of that trial so the apostle paul took the medicine and he'd say about that and then he'd say you know i was in prison yeah actually i was chained to a some soldiers but he didn't let being chained to a dead man hold him back he didn't say well i can't pray and god can't reveal the new testament to me because i'm having this kind of a day it was more than a day it was a long time right he was chained to soldiers or chained to a prison wall but yet he could pray and god poured in most of the new testament into his life you know we are still chained to a dead man this this carnival flesh right we're chained to it amen death will set it i mean the body change will set us free of this nature you know this guy that's why i think it's going to be the greatest the longer you live the more not because you're getting older you just want to get rid of this guy amen so it's going to be a wonderful time when when these bodies are changed but we should not allow this thing to hinder god pouring himself in amen amen amen so he took the he took the medicine and he'd say you know they were sharpening her axe because the emperor said his head's got to come off and and and i actually heard the axe being sharpened on the on the wheel but he but it didn't it didn't worry me because i knew i had a crown of life waiting for me and it was just a nice idea he knew it was there and he all said it's not just for me but all those that love the lord's glorious appearing hallelujah so he took the medicine and it worked amen what about stephen the first martyr he says lord don't lay this to the charge i see the son of god at the right hand of the father majesty on high i see jesus hallelujah it worked for him amen what about the martyrs did it work for them it worked for them they were fed the lions sawn us under all kind of horrible things i often think you know because god anoints us to overcome whatever we have to face right he anoints us that we will not give and we will not recant we cannot because we've been married we can't you we can't deny him because he's part of us we're part of him right but they're there in the coliseum now this is just me that's how i feel about it you know they hear the roar of the lions the crowd and all these things they're there but if you begin to think in a few moments you know the one we love you know the lord jesus that found us in slavery or wherever we were in the end of prostitution slavery being someone you know just a thief on the street no good rotten whatever or maybe some religious proud person thought that or something but then jesus came you know that one we feel this presence come close when we pray when we gather this great anointing comes and that sweet humble feeling comes over us we just love them and want more of them you know in a few moments it may be via that line but in a few moments i'm going to be standing in the presence of the one that loved me hallelujah and the gates would open they would go to victory hallelujah amen they would say that medicine worked hallelujah and down all the way down through the ages into this day amen you know it just wasn't brother bosworth that you know when he was dying he was on his deathbed and for hours people he would sit up and shake people's hands of believers that had gone on you know that he led to the lord and then brother brown came and saw him and said you know brother bosworth you know when's the greatest time of your life he says right now because the one that i've loved all these years is gonna walk through the store and take me home you know um brother red shell's wife i can't remember her name she had that same kind of experience it's on a death bed she'd sit up and shake people's hands there was no one in the room but they are in another dimension hallelujah yes so the ones that but the one that we love did the medicine work they could say absolutely you know when christine had that bike accident in switzerland and they gave her tramadol in the in the hospital and she had the anaphylactic reaction and she was actually she found herself leaving her body you know and her auntie or someone was there crying at her bed and things you know she said it because she knew she was dying but she said it was the greatest thing it wasn't scary there was no fear it was just joy and she and as she was leaving her body because she came back because she's still with us but you know where but she but you want to tell her auntie don't be sad it's a great thing if we just knew what was beyond the river and that's why the lord comes down and he and he ministers to our hearts we feel his anointing because he wants us to know there is a land beyond the river it's not human excitement it's not just emotion whatever it's there's more than that but he wants you to know you're part of that great eternal land hello that's why you're united with them now amen hallelujah amen so so peter would preach that on the day of pentecost that and the people would they would give their lives to be baptized in his name taking on his name and then in cornelius's house the gentiles received the holy ghost while peter was preaching but he says since they've received the holy ghost like weed in the beginning can we forbid water so they were baptized in name of the lord jesus christ amen but some people say but what about jesus in matthew 28 19 because he said baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and people say i'd rather take jesus words because it's in read in my bibles red letter bible i'd rather take that above what peter said but they don't understand that what is the name that's why i love it you have a prophet yay tall had an open book and he just asked a question what's the name what's the name and then you when you read it again you think well what is the name it's such an easy thing to skip over baptize them in the name of the one name of the father son holy ghost and he asked just ask the question what's the name so jesus said i come in my father's name and you receive me not his name is jesus right right and it's one name it's not names he didn't say repeat these words as you immerse people in water he says baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost that's the lord jesus christ so when peter said that on the day of pentecost he wasn't contradicting what jesus was saying because the same jesus that said in matthew 28 19 is the same jesus speaking through peter because god cannot there's no actual contradiction in the scripture right it's actually perfect but we need to understand you see how it ties together amen and he also said in mark he says him that believeth and is baptized shall be saved amen so you can take those things say devil here you go you try and put this fear and things in my lap i'm just going to put this into your lap what do you do with this amen we've got to take the devil back to the word too amen it's not just reminding the lord of his promises you to take the devil back into the words and the devil i've come according to god's provided way i've entered into the straight gate s-t-r-a-i-t it's spelt which is a narrow passage of water i've entered in the gate you know and i'm walking along the narrow way hallelujah the lord allowed me because he says many are many few there are that will find it so the lord now i'm not you remember when i speak about these things i'm just happy i'm in you know you get something like your favorite food or something i'm just happy i've got it maybe i'm like a little child on the inside but i'm just happy i'm in so i'm not throwing anyone out you must understand but jesus said few there are that will find it right i'm just happy i found it well the lord found he said no no come this way thank you lord hallelujah amen so now i'm just gonna wrap this up but he says so the lord says now this is the way we should go in and we should take the devil back to those moments and it says in the book of colossians whatever you do in word or deed to all the name of the lord jesus christ so baptism is a deed but we should take that into our life think is everything i do in my life can i do in the name of the lord we might be stopping doing a lot of things but let's just let's just keep that in mind so we can be super thankful if i can put it that way that the lord has caused us to be united with the new anointed word of this age amen which is the lord jesus christ the word amen hallelujah now i feel like i'm going to go off into another thought so i'm just going to read a couple of quotes and then i'm going to stop okay now he sees an identification who wants so he says now what was his mind to do the mind that was in christ always to stay with the father's word no matter how no matter what looked glossy and what looked this way it didn't make any difference to him the father's word is what counted everywhere when he met the devil he never used his own power to defeat him he used the word because that was him did you ever think he never wrote a book when he was on earth as far as we know he never wrote he never wrote but one time that was in the sand then erased it out probably afterwards why didn't he write a word because he was the word see he lived the word we don't need so many books when you become a written epistle of god see that's what god wants to be wants you to be images of him right she wants to take his word right in our hearts and then we become a living bible amen he says in sirs we would see jesus the things he said he says he that believeth on me saint john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also see we'll do the same works think the same thoughts live the same type of life if the spirit of god is in you it makes you live like christ christ like then you become a written epistle read of all men christ in you reflecting his light out of you as god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and reflected god from his own body no man has seen god any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him god was in christ and what god and sorry and what christ's attitude was was god's attitude because the two work together the spirit and the flesh unite together he says so he says the two come together become one and it should be the same thing with us and the lord right it's not we're not two we become one why because we dwell in the land of our fathers where there is a marrying going on where we are married to the lord jesus christ where it's not we're no longer two but we're one so now this is a challenge but jesus said if you he says because they asking the question show us the father he says have i been so long with you you don't know me now that same god is in you and i right so if i can put it this way when people see us they should see jesus right they should see so that doesn't mean you're going to grow a bed like this and wear a robe like he did and no no it's not about external appearance well unless it's but we do dress according to the scripture we understand that but it should be our nature our attitude the life that comes out of us should be jesus should be the word right that we are living epistles read known of all men amen can we have the musicians please this morning we're just going to finish there because i feel like i'm going into a whole different segue so i'll i'll keep that for another time i shouldn't say segway but a whole nother thought amen but we can have a real thanksgiving can't we amen we have left amen this world behind we have left doesn't matter what we came out of we've left it behind and the lord has brought us to a new land to himself to be united to himself amy talk about a thanksgiving hallelujah amen amen let's stand this morning amen and um i want to sing that song your goodness and mercy um um yeah i no no your goodness is running after me so i merge things together and then we're going to pray they're going to turn the surface over to you brother isaac to lead us in some songs if that's okay amen so let's um let's sing this i love you lord for your mercy never
