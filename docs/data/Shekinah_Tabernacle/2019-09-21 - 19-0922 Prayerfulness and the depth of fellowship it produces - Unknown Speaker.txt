precious faith a people Lord under expectation lot of people with the same purpose the same goal the same objective father nor we are going to the same destination Lord God we need a word this morning that can prepare us father that can further shape us Lord Jesus and bring us more into your glorious image and I pray Lord Jesus this morning that father you would take the word that Lord you've a lead on my heart to bring father and Lord Mirko director the heart of each one Lord Jesus may we come Lord may we be here under great expectation father Lord may we be in one mind and one accord Lord Jesus if there are critical spirits here this morning may those spirits be made subject to your word father Oh Lord we have not come to see a man we have not come to hear a new thing father nor we have come to receive the word that is needful for us to receive this morning Lord Jesus I pray O God may we go forth from this Tabernacle this morning I've changed people father Lord God may we go for a people who are rededicated to you father Lord may there be a deeper consecration in our lives Lord Jesus may we see the seriousness of the hour that we are living in Lord Jesus these are not motions of life when we come to church Lord we are here because there's a burning desire deep within us for a closer walk with you father I pray Lord Jesus may your word this morning cut down where it needs to cut Lord build up those who need to be built up Lord may it chasing and rebuke and edify and a heel and O God do all that is needful to be done this morning Lord Jesus we thank you for this blessed opportunity I thank you Lord for this time of worship father I thank you Lord that we are already in a channel for your word to go for Lord Jesus keep us in tune this morning keep us awake father keep us pulling on the word Lord it's not eyes speaking this morning but it's Christ in me I pray Lord God may you be the speaker and may you more than bless and more than meets each need here this morning for we ask these things your unfailing and most mighty name of Jesus Christ amen and a malicious thank the Lord this morning thank you Father praise your mighty name of Jesus hallelujah praise Lord praises mighty name Amen before I say any more let's take our Bibles thank you so much musicians you are so gifted I am NOT music praise the Lord it's very nice to be here in the house of the Lord this morning should kind of Tabernacle seeing many that I already know faces that I have not seen before but God bless you all it's wonderful to to be here this is my first time to minister and church from Taranaki by the Elroy Robertson's church and I Monday expectation this morning once he's thanked rather been and sister sister Christine for the hospitality for the invitation to come we had a wonderful meal my brother Andy dominant me just appreciate and may never leave God where the harness is talent then we find spiritually after that to the early hours of this morning and yeah I just see that things we were speaking about is where the Lord will have us go this morning and so without further ado let's think our Bibles to Matthew 6 we want to look at verses 913 of Matthew 6 I know that you are a well taught church you are establishing the word so I don't have to lay too much groundwork we go straight in you bring the word now if you don't understand all get the recording if you fall asleep get the recording and listen to it again that you might fully understand what it is that God is trying to wanting to achieve in our lives in this hour amen Matthew 6 verse 9 to verse 13 jesus speaking after this manner therefore pray our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil vine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen Jesus giving the pattern of prayer for every true believer who has the Holy Ghost in its pretty one more time gracious father Lord I cannot stress enough the importance of this subject father the greatest weapon that you placed in the hands of your people was held to approach you and fellowship Oh God how to break through the veil of our own humanity and take position at every promise lays in the power of prayer father I pray Lord Jesus may you take the subject and so expound it to your people this morning Lord Jesus they would go forth with a more concentrated life to see the word that's been preached then made reality in their lives Lord Jesus this is where we are add father it's not for a shortage of word it's a lack of consecration Lord I pray Lord Jesus and not your word this morning keep us in the channel to pull on the word and meet each need I pray in your mighty name Amen god bless you all saints you may may take your seats praise the Lord Ray's gone like to speak this morning on prayerfulness and the depth of fellowship produces prayerfulness and the depth of fellowship that produces brother bin nice to see you again yeah yeah may God bless you this morning amen the greatest thing God gave the church was prayer the greatest weapon God placed in your hands the thing that the people do not know how to harness correctly is the secret to you breaking through every entrance in your life prayerfulness is the greatest weapon that God gave a man he gave a woman where he gave a child's when you look at your life saints of God you will see that God has brought you through many things but you find that you've come to a place in your life off then where there's no further progression or there is as wishful Ness of a day where you could have a Liberty a day where you could have possession of the promises that are preached meeting after meeting in the church but you never have possession of those things because the key laid and fellowship with God and that's the one thing we neglect the devil is not interested in the consistency of your church attendance nor is he interested in how many hours you read the scripture nor how many messages are the prophet you listen to that means nothing to the devil he's fine with that but when a man goes to prayer that is the greatest threat to the devil amen it is not how much of the word you know it's who you know that will make the difference for every single one of us prayerfulness this morning I want to show you about prayer and fasting by the word how you harness those things to break through the veil of God to take you through the veil of self and realize your sovereign potential and what I'm called to is not what your call to and vice versa you're all unique your own sovereign your lives are mapped out by God and this morning this is a key the devil don't want you to know I harness it this morning go first from this place - these things I speak these things from my own experience of my own life will you realize that no matter how much you love the things of God how much time you spin and the things of God you know if you are away from that fellowship that communion with God in their private place of that secret chamber if you're away from that you will only go so far with God the proper was asked 1964 questions and answers how can a Christian get deeper in the love of God and in one line he says read the word and pray read the Word of God and pray and then he says I'm going to hurry just get as many as I can talking about the questions all it takes to get deeper in the love of God to fall into love with Jesus Christ is to read his word and talk to him about his word and from there all these other things will be added amen this is not going to fall that God to pray for a wife to pray for a home to pay for a pray for a pay increase this is going before God to commune with them on the basis of his word and on that basis with index is the wife and the pay rise and the home and every other thing that is lacking and needed lazed in that fellowship seek first the kingdom of God and all those other things are locked in the seeking of his kingdom amen my there are three things Jesus instructed us to do three things believe watch and pray belief watch and pray that's why this morning I'm not speaking about how well you know the word I'm talking about How well do you know him because if you know him he can reveal his word what is true revelation saints of God true revelation is relationship not a man who can sit down at the table and string together the mystery of the seven everything's with Scripture and quotation but still don't walk and overcoming life with Jesus Christ when a man knows his God who can take that word and make it effectual that is revelation until then it's still up here amen now in Matthew 6 Jesus is dealing with prayer and fasting and he's showing that both are connected in other words to have an effective prayer life fasting goes with it the two complement each other and the two are not optional these things are essential for the effectiveness of your walk in a flesh body because your flesh is not converted your flesh has a law of sin in it till the day the body is changed until then you will battle a man when you get the Holy Ghost your troubles do not end there your troubles begin amen when did Israel learn about about Emelec when they came out of Egypt Amalek was a grandson of Esau who was brother to Jacob the closest relation you have is Emelec who is the flesh and you did not know about the flesh when you were in the world because you were gratifying the sensuality of the flesh everything that was there you did not know about its power till the word came your way and called you to a separation and your first battle is with Emily amen and God said from generation to generation I will have war with Amalek who is the flesh therefore if you want to be effective in the warfare you need to be in fellowship with God and when did Amalek come to an end in the time of the book of Esther because emilich from him came a gag and from a guy came Heymann Haman is the last amela type recorded in the Bible and he was put to death by a woman when she came into a position as the Queen there was the execution of the humble last Amalekites the flesh was finally put into total subjection and until this body has changed you will have war with emilich amen amen so Lord make us effective in our warfare help us to believe a lord I believe that help down my unbelief Lord boost my faith you come this morning and you sit under the word to have your faith and a true faith is not given it's already there but it is increased as you sit under the word Amen believe watch and pray Jesus showing that both these things prayer and fasting with secret things of God these were not public things a man this is not for me to come this morning and tell you about how often I pray how often I fast how much time I spend in the word these are private things between you and God but nobody to know all that they see is a life manifesting Jesus Christ but what they don't see is the consecration behind the seniors amen and how were the disciples watching the fullness of the word who had the force of the Holy Ghost in prayer all the time Jesus was not born in sin but had a body like unto sin in order to experience what you experience in a flesh body and if Jesus had the fullness of the word and had the fullness of the Spirit and had to pray how much more is it required of you who does not have the fullness of the word and has a stately the spirit by measure how much more is it required of you to pray how much more is it required of us who only have it by measure when you are sitting under the word you are receiving more of the Holy Ghost annex to they were filled with the Holy Ghost but an X for they were refilled with the Holy Ghost when does the filling stop the fullness of the Holy Ghost for your body is not the livers glorified till then there is more of the Holy Ghost to be heads amen the Prophet said some of only got enough Spirit of God to stop them smoking enough to stop them drinking enough to get them out of bed push the accelerator and come to church that's all I've got but there's more Holy Ghost of your head to take what you receive in the church and make it effectual in the workplace effectual in the home picture on the streets of Satan's Eden there's more spirit to be handed amen Lord make us a prayerful people amen until you have that friend you will only go so far in your walk you can come to every convention come to every altar call pour out tears on the ground but until there is that consecrated life behind the scenes between you and God you will keep coming up the front for the same thing yeah after year when I see it I see how watched it and we see it because there's a lack of teaching amen Jesus he is showing the location of Prayer the position of Prayer and he gives you the pattern of Prayer right he shows you the place the position and how to pray now think about this there is a time when we play pray as a church there right yeah there's a time we pray as brothers there's a time we pray as a family but then what Jesus is talking about is private one-on-one prayer alone from all distraction where you can stay there if you wish for hours in the presence of God this is the prayer life that I'm talking about this morning I'm not talking about a brother's prayer meeting I'm not talking about praying as a church or a family I'm talking about private prayer one-on-one well you pour out all things to him that's what I'm talking about this morning amen and this is what I want you to understand so I want you to Nancy it's powerful Jesus says you go into the closet to pray the closet is the bedchamber in other words the private place whether that's where ever you want to go like the Prophet went to that cave in Greensville Indiana and in prayer the angel came let me tell you if an angel is appeared in these last days he's appeared on an age level but he has yet to appear for some on an individual level and until you are there at your altar of incense you'll never make the angel he must appear personally that is how the angel comes when you get alone with God he will draw near when you when we worship God this morning as a body of the lever stirs to do what was to bring the Holy Spirit down right to bring the angel down for the word to come forth this is why there's a responsibility of the song leader in the way that the songs are sung the songs are about the word that's unfolding in this age the musicians have responsibilities before the song leader steps up to create the atmosphere that will set the whole path of the service every office every position and the church must understand its calling but for lack of teaching people hindering the church because they are not understanding what their calling encompasses Jesus showed go to a private place wherever there is in the bedroom in a cave wherever you go to get alone with God go somewhere and then he shows you the position of Prayer who said that you had to be on your knees jesus said when you stand praying who said you had to be on your knees who says that you have to stand who said that who made these traditions on how you pray when they're not even in the word you can kneel and pray you can stand and pray I fell on face it prey can sit and pray you can drive and pray wherever you are walk and pray who said that it has to be this way who said you have to do this who said that men made that up the link we have to God is not subject to traditions of men message of the hour did not come to establish a firm tradition yeah take the great tradition and restore the way God appointed for things to be done that's why we do not live under the law that's why the word gives you Liberty because it's breaking a formalistic 2,000 years of false teaching yeah because it's so engrained in the subconscious I must do things this way in this way and now serving God as a Chow must under enjoyable experience for many is coming to church and serving God what Paul hated Maya was sharing this with the church the other day Paul hated that Jesus he knew because he was persecuting the church he had in his mind who Jesus was and he hated that Jesus so much he went to lock up the followers of this Jesus but what did Paul need he need to meet Jesus without the mask and who did he meet not a man wearing sandals in a robe he met the pillar of fire Jesus without the mass and I Charlie when he met the real Jesus without the mask now he has changed from a persecutor to the Apostle and prophet of the age let me say this to you young people this morning if you don't enjoy coming to church well or anything that relates to the things of God all you need is to meet Jesus without the mass you need to meet him outside of how you think of though he is because when you meet them in that form I tell you will change you we're good in it Lord Jesus be more to me than what these ones talk about what the denominations present a mess you must be real I must meet you I'm not satisfied with the testimony of what Paul hen or what the Prophet had or what brother Ben will brother Andy or others at had but Lord I must meet you I must have my own experience amen watch this in Luke 3 Jesus was baptized as they're right he was not baptized for repentance he was baptized because as the sacrifice he had to be washed but when he went to the waters of baptism the Bible said they have an open and the Spirit of God descended in the form of a dove and when he was baptized the Bible says when heaven open he was praying Luke 3 verse 21 Jesus when he was praying the Holy Ghost came down then when he was adopted and Luke 9 when he was transfigured his adoption he was praying when that took place at his baptism when the fullness of the Holy Ghost came down he was praying at his adoption which is spiritual maturity he was praying now think of that when you receive the Holy Ghost that is the start of your spiritual journey that's why it's called the new birth you are a spiritual baby who makes a ton of mistakes babies do not get things right do they they are not mature children they're not mature they are babies they they say the wrong thing act up the wrong way but because they are born they have a life they are still a sunless to the daughter so when you receive the Holy Ghost you'll not mature you're only a baby still rank in the things of the world you're on a journey to spiritual maturity amen that's why you need more of the Holy Ghost to bring you more and more into the image of your heavenly Father and therefore if Jesus at the time of baptism when he received the Holy Ghost and its fullness that's the paradox of the Godhead he was born by the Holy Ghost beget his food with the Holy Ghost and his baptism that's why it was a great mystery for the H if he who had the spirit without measure prayed at the time of baptism how much more will it take prayer from the time you received the Holy Ghost to your adoption all the way from the rebirth to full maturity must be a strong fellowship with God all the way all the way and Jesus also as a ministry did nothing except what the father showed him and how did the father show him all things because there was a communion a link established in order for the father to reveal his will to the son and now why often can't we find the will of God for our lives to know what to do what to speak when to step back when to rebuke when to encourage why are these things lacking because that communion is not there for the father to show you when to go about this your growth from spiritual infancy to spiritual maturity is all based on prayer fellowship with God prayerfulness I tell you you see people that will take drugs to try and settle their nerves all kinds of medicines with you see people smoking cigarettes to remove the shakes there is a nothing that will settle you like prayer will when you get beyond the tiredness and thinking about the fishing trip and all the distractions that surround you and you pray through that barrier to God comes down there's nothing that will settle you like that if you've been in that place I tell you there's nothing that can put you in an atmosphere like that amen Jesus wasn't prayer and Luke 11 and Hera his disciples watching him pray and they are struck by how this man can access God and they say to him Lord teach us how to pray but all those disciples were already praying people because all through the Old Testament that Torah that they knew so well it was read to them it's filled with the prayers of the Saints now here they are seeing a man praying like no man prayed and they say Lord teach us because when you pray you access the father every time you are a man when you walk the word is on display the word is effective when we don't have what you have teach us how to commune like you can so we can have the life that you do have oh my so Jesus sing that's teaches them how to pray why am i and my all that Jesus accomplished was by fellowship with the father now watch what the prophets in realized the Prophet was God to the aged Moses was God to the people and brother Branham though he was a prophet he was a son of man he was God to the aged because God was in their vessel but the Prophet is off the scene but the word never left the earth and the word is Jesus Christ and the word is now in a body of believers therefore where is God that's heresy to those not trained in the word but you are God to the age and the people stumble at it because of the humanity paths but the sole part fish part and the spirit part backslides and disappoints Bailey but the soul part is completely glorify so parties where God is that's what stumbles of people how can there be God in this vessel who sometimes explodes and says the wrong thing it does the wrong thing how can God be a net by God is in there and when your eyes are inching you by the word you see God in there when you look at your brothers and your sisters you see God in them you gonna be on that surface of 80 cents worth of New Zealand dust South African dust wherever you're from African dust and you lookin you see the soul paths when God is looking at you this morning he's looking at your soul that's why he says you're perfect now when we look at one another we want to start looking beyond the skin and look into the soul we can look my brother's my sisters sure they have these other things but I have things to a man praise the Lord and the Prophet said in fellowship with God through reconciliation 1956 and this meeting I have thought of doing this many people has watched my life in the healing campaign how that the things would take place and the prophetic gifts and so forth I would just like to tell you how that's done my this is there was no man with a supernatural ministry or prophet and people were watching that I wanted to know how it's done and he said I'll tell you how it's done BET's done through fellowship with Jesus Christ no other way no other plan no trick to it just simply praying fellowship taking God at His Word what he said was truth believing it that just settles it then talk to him love him and thank him for it and that does it why do you have a powerless unfulfilled life because you're not in that fellowship with Jesus Christ like where you should be that's why you get out of bed in the morning you drag your feet to work and you can't stand for him witness about them minister to the needs pray for the sick live a full life of Jesus Christ because there's a lack of fellowship that don't quicken your faith to walk into those things that is why you live way below God ordained privileges amen amen maybe you just get sick of just coming to church or just going to conventions of just sitting with believers and talking about the things of God don't you want to go further than that haven't you got more land than that well Lord raised my faith let me tell your friends if you were having to settle your racing heart beat and wipe off the beads of sweat on your face before you can do something for God you're not there yet because when Jesus moved he was come man in u.s. position go and speak you win him speaks but God brings you their place just go and do the word you're not ashamed it's something you're shy it's you're ashamed that it's subconscious fear the greatest curse was fear the greatest enemy was yourself the greatest battle is the mind the three great things are all in this flesh body and need to be dealt to through fellowship with Jesus Christ Jesus gave the pattern of Prayer and the pattern of prayer is for those who have the Holy Ghost only those who are born again not for people in the denominational world the only people who can pray correctly of those who have the Holy Ghost now watch the pattern that Jesus gave and you will see why you need the Holy Ghost why you need our Father oh this is how we pray you know how we pray is not our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be then that's the pattern yeah that's the pets a blueprint on how you pray that's not how you pray right this is how you pray our Father you acknowledge his Godhead but how can you acknowledge his Godhead except you have a prophet to reveal the mystery of God first if there's no prophet whose message was to reveal the mystery of God how can you say our Father and if you see that he is your father you must see that you are son cuz he cannot be a father less you are a son right the Prophet said he says there's no eternal son before they cannot be an eternal father because he's not a father to the other son about it I know you're thinking on that one asked me afterwards our Father you must acknowledge his Godhead you must see who he is that's why you need a prophet the mystery of God came by a prophet then you see who you are sons and daughters when we start talking about when you know who he is then you know who you are we talk about we want we know who we are but do you know who God is because unless you know God as you don't know who you are but when you know who God is you know you are a son amen our Father you acknowledge his greatness his awesomeness you don't rip into prayer with all your list of demands that shallow top it's a man don't know how to approach his father you go before the Lord in that private prayer and you start thanking him praising him worshiping him our Father give him glory for all that he's done he wants to hear that then he'll come down hallelujah that's how you pray which art in heaven all you need to know not just who he is but where is he at he's in heaven where is heaven I said that Bros in Pakistan I said brother zekiel lives in Pakistan where is Pakistan if I gave you a blank map of the world where no borders that define on the map point to me where Pakistan is an and for the average European definitely for other races they will not be able to find where Pakistanis you see we know that God is in heaven nominations no he's in heaven problem is they don't know we have news yeah see the prophesied heaven consists of the wood yeah heaven consists of the word therefore the whereabouts of God is in his word heaven is a faith civilization and the faith is the revelation of the word that makes an economy function so therefore God our Father is in his word and his approach on the basis of his word his approach on the basis of his word then therefore you need to be taught the word to know how to approach this God this father that you have when they discredit the prophets and everything that he said this man who had the keys to unlock the whole Bible when you throw that away how can you access God how can you know how to approach him how could he responded cannot because you must pray on the basis of the word that's revealed yeah amen he says hallowed be thy name this is a God who is a holy God a God of sanctity a God of standards a God of Maros a God of righteousness that's the God that we serve and his sons and daughters are bearers of his name you are bearers of his name when Jesus said when God said when he gave those Commandments those ten commandments one of them was thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God and then the taking of it the name of the Lord in vain is not when you curse because this is given away before any of that this is when you claim to be something but you're not you are bearing his name in vain and this is why the denominational world all claim that Christ is their husband that they say they are married to him but all the children they are producing don't look like him meaning they've been with somebody else they are bearing his name in vain that is why they are called harlots because they claim they are married to him but the children they are bringing forth to not bear the characteristics of Jesus Christ their father been in folks Union Amen you get up from under this word you are straight and folks Union because if you're not married to him he says have no other god but me cuz I'll have no other wife by you he's gonna have no other wife but you so have no other God but him and if you find that you are deadly and anything that puts God second you're in folks union you're in fornication Amen so let the word dropper and must praise the Lord there is a sanctity required of us so a bearers of his name the Bible says Jesus says thy will be done in as it is in heaven and in other words to know the will of God not for this earth but for this you first have to see it in heaven to know the will of God for your life you must see it first in heaven for Moses to build a tabernacle on the earth you had to see the pattern first in heaven and when you come to church the will of God is preached the pattern in heaven is showin that you might go before the Lord in private and say Lord thy will that was to preach this morning in the Church of fellowship and the depth of consecration it can bring that it would be established in this earth of my life a man we must behold they have any vision amen my little pet and be preached every Sunday and every Wednesday and in your private life listen to the message read the word look at the pattern that might be established that it might be done in your life hallelujah give us this day our daily bread I'm not interested in the word that was preached on Sunday prior or Wednesday it's been give me the bread of this morning I want a bread or word for right now give me that hallelujah on a present tense manner amen and Wednesday coming is manna for that day hallelujah everything that God reveals to you on a daily basis is because you need it for that hey Amen I tell you something friends you get under the word you spend time in the word spend time and fellowship with God and watch when you sit down and talk to somebody it's all about the very thing you've been looking at in there amen because it's daily bread sovereign to you what God opens up to me is unique for what I must deal with today and likewise for you phrasal I make it personal word Amen for moze yeah yeah yeah present tense word a continuity of the winner you know what bread is for food bread is for strength strength is for service we're not taking them as prey to sit at our homes and do nothing we are receiving strength to serve our God amen we are rugged soldiers we are not dressed up we are not armored up for decorative purposes the Deacon is not put at the back of the church for decoration he's put there to fulfill an office a commission that's defined in the word amen you're not being equipped with these things in Ephesians 6 to look the part you're called to go into battle you're called to do something with what you're being given Amen when we stand before God when the rewards are given out its rewards for service what did you do with what I cooked you with if I gave you one Talent five talents ten talents whenever I gave you that you invested you use it and if it's because of fear that you are unable to invest go before the Lord and tell them just tell the Lord any dark deep problem you've got just tell the Lord of this one who understands one who will be able to bring a resolution a solution it's our God you don't need the counseling the therapists and some self-help book get on your knees private police and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors prayer fellowship is based on forgiveness unless there's forgiveness you can't tap into God hallelujah my my my Jesus isn't mac-11 therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when you pray believe that you receive them in other words present tense believe it is finished you have them now and ye shall future tense have them you need healing believe you've got it right now and you'll get hey man my my my and in a Matthew 18 Jesus gave the parable of the great Lord who had a servant who owed a great debt of ten thousand talents and he called his servant and he says pay me what you owe ten thousand telling us and the man says I can't pain I don't have I don't have it and the Lord said well gods look him up sell his wife and children make them bun slaves till this man pays his debt and that servant fell at the feet of his Lord says Lord and mercy with me have patience with me I'll pay you all and the Lord was so moved by that they're genuine plea of the servant he forgave him a great debt but that one who was forgiven a great bits had a fellow servant who owed him a hundred pence repents and he his brother and he says pay me what you owe me yeah and he could not he said look I don't have 100 pills I got nothing I paid the electricity and put feeling the car and got the groceries were nothing there were nothing more it says well ramen in the prison yeah this man forgot what his Lord had just done for him forgave him a great debt he cannot forgive a brother from a minor debt and so this this 100 pence was given over to the tormentas was put in prison was locked up but he should pay and word got back to the Lord Himself of what had taken place and that servant was now called to stand before the Lord and give an account for what he had done and the Lord said I forgave you a great debts and you can't even forgive your brother are minor debts and now I'm gonna turn you over to the tormentors well you should pay what you owe now think about that our Lord forgave us a great dish I sin that you could not pay with your own blood amen and he himself paid your debt on Calvary 2,000 years ago and yet we look at our brothers and sisters who do minor things against us and for 15 20 25 years we still hold it against them to the stake and wonder why we cannot tap into the things of God because of unforgiveness fellowship with God is based and that's why you need to get before God and when you've finished all your talking wait before God and wait till he can come down and start showing you this brother this sister you need to go and see you need to make that right don't just tell me about it we need to go to them and if you can't do that you say Lord I know but I can't do it now Lord strengthen me yeah help me to humble myself to do this what is very awkward for me to make a race the expense of my reputation the expense of how I will be seen if I do it help me Lord that I might have a greater Bella shoot a deeper walk where these the supernatural can be seen in my life bring me to that place hallelujah praise alone in the Great Commission 1958 one of the great quotes of prophecies he says if I have found grace in your sight through God you take my word for this brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he is absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong in other words he has really done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that oh I tell you we are designed by a nature where we can sit for three hours and talk about the folks of one another and my five minutes of talking about any good that's just boring it's an interesting that's not worth sharing with others but the bad my we can feed on it we love it we're good at it we are designed in a student body to do that and here he says don't tell nobody about it because in this life when you receive the Holy Ghost it's the word man on the inside that is controlling you you're not controlled by flesh you have to be controlled by the word just tell no man don't mention that you take him to prayer before God now amen and don't take it in a way of just a selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his short and stand in the presence of God our Father where prayer should be made in the presence of God say father here's my brother and he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why he did it then let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that oh my you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down to where earth when you get back down to earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand cuz you know what he's been through my you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe in no sir even if he is a ranked sinner my how do we forgive our knees where ever before God to him to show you what we've been through that we can truly forgive amen that's why before we take the communion the bread and the wine that ordinance we were instructed to partake of first if any man assault against his brother let him make it right because it's communion fellowship why is there many who are sickly and weak and many sleep among you because of a lack of forgiveness why is sickness in the church why sickness in people's lives why is it things that stay there year after year why because of a lack of forgiveness people who cannot let go that's why people stay in these conditions that's why the church is often handed one man a cannon took some silver and a gold a golden wedge in Babylonian garments and all these things one man and the church sauce 36 men died one man brought about the death of 36 innocent men producing a whole bunch of families of widows because of one man's sin in the church and when they came back to the pasture when it came back to a Holy Ghost full man he realized there's sin in the camp when I'm looking at amongst a body of believers and I see we are stagnating we realize there's something in the camp that needs to be rooted out needs to be identified that a church can move on to greater victory when they went to AI they were to take the city with no deaths on their sign and Joshua as far as he was concerned was a great disgrace and utter defeat to the kemberly the 36 mentioned I was not this was not to be God has called you to victories at the expense of mental life of many men churches a body walks on immunity takes position when we attended his sin under Kemp is unbelief in the kit forgiveness prayer takes you into the throne room of God in that place in that presence you can only forgive that's why I tell you when we're talking about private prayer not talking about praying as a family and all these things they have their place we're talking when you get alone with God yeah because that is the greatest form of Prayer just you and him then I'll be transitioned to the family and the church and the brothers and so forth but this is the greatest place to be and in that place you go beyond the tiredness when you come to church go beyond the timeless go beyond thinking about the lunch it's a Shelly what are you here for with feeding a word man the word man there's often neglected between Sunday and Wednesday and Wednesday and Sunday that par that's neglected that's what we're here to feed this morning amen all right you go beyond that still God comes down and that's where time don't matter in the presence of God you make time subject to eternity eternity was before time time came because of the fall let me tell you this I said this to the church back home I preached the same thought 24 hours have not changed in 6,000 years you think time Speer that time does not spit up time never spit up that hours full of 60 minutes yeah yeah 3,600 seconds hasn't changed because you have become so busy you feel if I'm speeding up you allowed Satan the camera to place the minds that you felt were of an important tool to your life and the first thing you did was push God to the background that's why you've got no time you got Yury engineered your life to accommodate the devil that's why you've got no time you're more concern about your pay and your keeping your car and having all these things to look the parts then what you are concerned about the things of God that's why you have no time I'll show you that proper talking about Martin Luther the more he had to do and he felt like everything else he got done why because you put seek first the kingdom of God and all the other things that Adams you seen that have you actually seen that in your life you go before God and you're given your time you go to work and things fall into place unusually fall into place just doesn't normally happen that way until you start putting him really fast my cuz God honors his word you mean we have to accommodate God man if you accommodate God that's what God will do you want to accommodate the devil who does nothing for you all you get is more letters with windows in them when you accommodate the devil that's all you get all these things you have to pay all these bills all these things that's all you get when you accommodate the bill yeah but when you come and they God the one who provides the healing provides the peace provides the sleep that you need you mean if I if I go before the Lord and make some time to pray before I go to bed and it's already laid the morning wore out but if you don't and you go to bed all you're gonna do is cost and turn on my anyway but imagine if you just able more things went to bed and watch how that in ten minutes it's like eight hours worth of sleep I think God is limited that's right Lord opened our eyes to see how we are to live our lives amen and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil what is prayer to find the leadership of the Holy Ghost lead us Lord because he the Holy Ghost said in Revelation 3:10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation lead us not into temptation by keeping the word of my patience I will keep you from the hour of my the Holy Spirit is speaking my Hosie speaking to his people amen which shall come upon all the worlds upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth everybody's being tempted but the only ones have been cats are those in fellowship with God hallelujah why do you see pivot conventions don't messed up in the world they're not being kept from the hour of temptation because they have not yet to meet the unmasked God and receive them in their lives hallelujah temptation is a path to evil but the Holy spirt will keep you on the right path keep us on the right path you're going astray this morning all you gotta do is go before the Lord make it right repent and press on amen you don't have to wake 10 days to feel holy a game just say Lord I'm sorry and press up like you never did it that's all it takes hallelujah amen for vine the Lord says as he finishes his prayer for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever hallelujah God will set up his kingdom on the earth on this earth but first he will set it up in you a man before a millennial world is established he will first establish his kingdom in here amen the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man by then he talks about all these parables about men he sets up his parable and his kingdom in your life God alone has the power to achieve his will his word for your life you cannot do it don't bother trying to do it say lord I cannot do it I've tried Lord for 25 years I cannot do it like Abraham I just kind of lump finish I've had enough then the Lord can come raisa Lord take your hands off and say Lord I go to work this morning ashamed of you are you change it amen I go I go into this day Lord I have no plans it's just an ordinary I'm fulfilled they like it's been for the last 30 years but Lord you come into this day and bring change what do you think it means to serve God does it mean when you're standing behind a pulpit you're serving God when you run a DVD being watched by another church that you're serving Ghana that's what people think it means to serve God when that when they're doing something in the church and say it's when you step out of bed in the morning say Lord here am I leave me by your spirit and God will bring you into contact with every person that you need to be in contact with and you serve Him in that measure and when you are effective and faithful and then measure he will take you on to greater things till you are living out the fullness of your personal Commission hallelujah I'm sorry about all the spit you might need a wearing jacket in front rate and the final word was a min what does that mean so be it in other words all these things Lord let them be in my life I don't just want half of what you've sinned all of what you've sinned let it be established let it be done Lord as much as it hurts and might feel like an inconveniences but let it be done hallelujah and now you watch the change some of us I know that you're people here that know what I'm talking about this morning people here have been in that place of Prayer you know the power of it but often for all of us and myself included they are memories of those times this is called to be more than a memory this is called to be a consistent everything well in other words when you're washing the dishes you're in fellowship with God when you're out there and spanners and graceful of your eyes communion with God in a supermarket communion with God he's the first one you talk to it the dawning of a new day when you talk to at the end of the day and the one you talk the most to during the day you're so conscious of God by being in fellowship with him my what a God and he wants that so much but you know what this God is a gentleman you don't push him herself on you he's not like that he just wants you to act your own leisure yeah your own willingness go before him and say Lord here am i and here we go and do he what a bliss above what you can imagine wouldn't you want to serve a God why don't be married to somebody like that God don't force himself the devil forces himself or he makes you listen to his music everywhere you go you have to listen to it you have to watch all his stuff on the billboards and see it in the magazines is on the television and internet everything pops up it makes you see all that and what does it do for you yeah all you do is you go through life the ejected bombarded falling plenteous tears it's empty this is the devil that we make a lot of accommodation for and that's all he can do for you I think the devil cares about your talent the devil will harness your talent you glorify him and when you've said his purpose you'll spit you out and leave you on the side walls right yeah that's the devil all these great movie stars ones have served their purpose they get spat out and all they end up is laying dead on a bear the whole bunch of needles around them yeah they're drunk whatever shots yeah they serve their purpose to glorify the devil and he spits them out and that's the devil we accommodate often what does God called us to God won't spit you out I'll tell you what when you've served your purpose he takes you home to glory they take you've served your purpose the reason why you were here this morning and woke up and drew breath cuz you and not finish with you as long as you draw breath you have a service we purpose what is godly as you spit you up now he promotes you the glory death is promotion for the break hallelujah she's not going down she's going to our greater body at the opening that's already waiting hallelujah we're talking about this last night and the Holy Ghost links you up with your word representation that is already there in other words brother Chris the real you is over there and perfection the real me is over there already in perfection and I never knew it without the Holy Ghost but when the word came my way something within me responded and when I received the Holy Ghost and aligned me with my word representation hallelujah death is only the proper seat of buggie how it hitches you up to take you in the glory amen praise the Lord let these things be done Lord what is prayer prayer is humanity praying to deity that's what the people stumble over if he is God why is he praying who's he praying to Jesus was all God and completely men oh that's the mystery of it's his humanity his flesh humanity prayed to the deity within him when you pray humanity prays to the deity who is the Holy Ghost already on the insane that's why the pattern of prayer is for those who have the Holy Ghost hallelujah my and if he was a fullness of the word and had to pray what about you only half of my measure yeah oh how much greater do we need to pray in this busy age slow it down lock yourself in a room for 24 hours and appreciate how long the day is you'll find nothing spit up yeah are you tired shall I continue you know if there's one subject for me in my whole life to this point that holds such a great evaluates in the subject there is nothing like this this is the greatest tool and we are come to harness there's nothing like this subject Jesus Jesus showed us that prayer and fasting are connected present optional when you feel like it prayer is not what you make yourself do pray comes forth from within you it's automatic amen that's why when we come to church but some of us it's automatic we brother Andy said last night David said I was glad and when they said to me come and let's go up to the house of the Lord something happened to David so when it was said let's go up to Zion oh my let's go up but but but for many of us it saw something and it's brother saw and said he has a record of being about two hours minimum it's three hours and in a munch is the chicken is set to 12 p.m. and I know we get home and it's all carbon DUP and and and listen that and what inconvenient they can the Lord change that why you know what if you don't feel like that this morning I I'm glad to be in the house the Lord and I tell you there were days and my life I was not glad to go up to the house to the Lord you know what changed that the Lord did for some of you that might be today it might be tomorrow might be in five years whenever but you all have your appointed time amen you can't get ahead of that time wherever you are no matter how messed up you are you exactly where God wants you even if it's the depth of sin you're a right where God wants you amen that's the paradox of free moral agency you have choice but God already knows hallelujah my prayer and fasting is connected now when Jesus was transfigured in Matthew 17 him Peter James and John descend from the mountain and the first thing they encounter is a man who has a child who is a lunatic possessed by a devil and the disciples were unable to cast the devil out and the the father of the child rushes to Jesus Falls of his fingers what help me my son he's possessed and he saw VEX and he falls into the fire and into the water and he thrashes about you know how many times people had epileptic fits when they stood in the presence of the Prophet the devil always reacted when the people stood in the presence of the Prophet and scratched about because he knew his time was up and Jesus does Jesus work himself up this devil I'll show these disciples stand aside this site was Galloway bring me this - that's not what Jesus did bring me the child you see Jesus does the Bible says that he paused abundance of did jesus shake the child come out of him devil Jesus rebukes the devil and the devil leaves and that his psyche was shocked because Jesus approach was so unorthodox because I'd been shaking the stuffing out of that little boy and they've already been shaking enough with the devil in them and Jesus comes along and just says leave and the devil leaves a child and the disciples are what is this and they come to Jesus apart and they say why could we not have tossed them out why could we not cast out this devil you've already given us power to cast out Devils and now we've come across one that we are actually powerless against and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed then you shall say to this mountain being the Mount of Olives removed hence to you on the place in the cherry moon now when we talk about this mountain we're not spiritualizing it as a mountain of faith it's a mountain a grain of mustard seed faith has the power to move not a mountain of sin at a mountain now the eggnog Mount Ruapehu adds that power just a great grain size faith spiritual eyes so many things these things are that and he says if you had that kind of faith you could say the mountain be removed and a wooden and nothing shall be impossible unto you healthy yet however this kind of devil dough is not out but by prayer and fasting man you mean you can only go so far handle Devils to a certain extent without fellowship with God yeah do you realize there are things there are Devils that often sit in your life that you are unable to deal with because you are out of a place of fellowship with God why do you have the setting sins that you just can't seem to shake off you've been up in older calls and they can't shake them out why there's no fellowship because in that fellowship see those two things that consecration is what will drive up every kind of bill every kind of devil my there are people out there in the world who because gifts and callings over there up repentance by Birds they had a gift of faith and cast out there but they themselves have devils in their own life that are not cast out because unless they walk under this message to bring a real consecration there's no change in them this is more than just what we can do fathers what could the Lord doing us these things are connected friends that's why I want to show you these things this morning Jesus never told his disciples how often he prayed how often he fasted yeah all he did was prove this consecration by casting oh yeah that's the secret something man who makes all the noise yeah there was a man just comes walking and he speaks it's not the place a Stanford I've listened to ten messages of the Prophet since Monday I've been praying for 15 hours minimum weekly and of that there is a man we behind-the-scenes private fellowship with the left hand don't know what the right hand is doing you like no idea he looks this personal absolutely ordinary to all of us just looks like the same brother Andy that he was last week or five years ago but what you don't know is what exists behind the scenes and here comes a man walking and he can speak and he's effective and Devils are responding he's proving where he's at in the word by a manifestation by a life expressing what's happening behind the scenes you see that yeah it's not about how much you talk about what you do yeah your prowess with the quotes in the scriptures right it's when there is something to be done you go forth and you do like it's just ordinary the supernet was natural God wants to bring it in supernet was just natural just that's my life it's just what happens it's just what I do you eat breakfast because that's what you do you're in sweet communion with God because that's just what you do it's just my life I decide maybe we we have to start scrapping some things to give them now time you find out that 80% of what you do is totally a waste of time because as long as you want a body of flesh you are naturally attracted to fleshly service you can sit down for hour after hour on youtubing and you start off watching about gardening and you end up watching about Jurassic Park by the end of the journey three hours later and you complain after we reach an hour and a half in the church watch full of Gaea blah the Rings nine hours piece of cake eazy-e's and complain yeah when you come into the house of God so you realize now that we indulge heavily and things that are totally unnecessary yeah and you find that those things a bit from men to often to our walk they're not sinful some of those things they're not all sinful things but for some of us they are hindrances in our life and for God to have the greater effect in your life he calls you to a separation first there must be an acceptable separation to come into an acceptable union God will place demands on you that he will not place on other people he will show you things in that private time of prayer hey look my son is spending too much time watching these things cut these things off because when you're cutting things off God gives you something better all right when you stop smoking it's not for you to go and be dry in a craving for a smoke for God to give you something bit time always give me something bitter right we didn't come to sturb the Lord to enjoy a life a disappointment it was to come at the true joy we actually find out what fulfillment is it's beyond winning the lotto amen beyond winning the lotto let me tell you this how many of you here this morning thought that when you got married you would be complete some of you did and when you got married and everything it settled down you found out that you were still not satisfied and then you thought if I got the pay rise and it's so much in the bank I feel like I'm really and complete and when you got there was good at the time not a little while no leading more you thought when you had children family by the home and have some more life and I'd feel completes and you've got the children in the family and it was all good and that's wonderful ahead but we found your student and completes and you realize no matter what you think will be the thing that really settles it for you and gives you a sense of accomplishment it's always elusive it's never it's the only thing that can bring a lasting fulfillment is when Christ is first then with your wife and your children all the money in the bank of the nice car in the flesh home your completes because God is in it hallelujah why not seek them first get your priorities the right way hey man then all these other things can be added why do people run after other things because they're empty you're empty that's why you run after other things get Christ in where you have a purpose and you find out you actually don't need those things because you're full of Jesus Christ and all you want to give your time to is serve Him you don't have time for the devil anymore you've got too much of God to deal with mine and I have too much of God praise the Lord hallelujah I tell you I'm preaching to myself this morning I'm raking myself over the coals and cutting deep because it's it's needful for me but I see it in the way I say Lord give me this give me that Lord hallelujah praying fasting a secret things they will produce a consecrated life watch what the Prophet said in Smyrna church age he says we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually it is not with money that God works he moves by his Spirit and that moving of the Spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the words hallelujah you want to see God move have a life consequence freeze alone the disciple has already had the power to cast out Devils and Mach three they were already commissioned given the power and now they faced a devil they were lacking the faith cast out they didn't even have mustard seed faith because if they had that they could cast the devil out how much faithful weed eating friends cooking out what is faith revelation in other words give me a clearer understanding of your word and what is revelation relationship what he said last night it's a relationship that by the hour Albert's is their relationship that's what it is to know him because when you know him who's casting out the devil not me that's the God I know in me that's God standing there or what devil can stand against there was God standing before the lunatic child the devil could stand before that never was created by God you had to obey God hey man moving of the Spirit comes to a life consecrated to the word praise the Lord now what is fasting we pray he just Lord out fast teachers Lord how to pray teach me Lord out fast what is it you realize these things are not difficult at all things are not actually a burden at all it's very straight for God is not going to give any things to inconvenience right that's not how God works 1964 the message identification the Prophet said a lady asked me coming down the road the other day from up here it's Florence who should carry and brother Dimas his sister it's just the Williams and then they sit in the car and she said brother Brennan I fast and fast and fast and still I can't cast out Devils I said you wasn't born to do such your duty is fast the Holy spirt is working on somebody else out there for that in other words for the casting out of the devil but your part is too fast you don't know the place now this woman the theme master carrion sister Florence she had a gift of fasting some people are gifted to pray is a gift of bread yeah that's why the church is prayer warriors who want a highness but then there's people like me who are not gifted in prayer and that's why for me it's breaking through the veil but when there's a gift you watch they can just soldier maybe Channel that's a gift and like this woman she had a gift of fast it was just an anointing something a better life just made her that way too fast because fasting is perverted right it's because there's a need a burden something's weighing on you and she says I'm doing I'm fasting I'm praying when I'm fasting and I can't cast our business and the prophecy because you were not called to cast your Judy is too fast what was the success of the prophets and ministry the success of the ministry was not that just the angel had appeared to him the success of the ministry was the angels are the brothers you say out the back praying for the bros on their knees but nobody saw praying for him is what gave the success all those meetings I trust successive this morning is because they were phrase be phrase you've got to know what you're called to the limitations of boundaries of your corner don't try and take dance portion or dad's Porsche ashes Porsche you take your portion what the Holy Ghost he finds to what Joshua tells you is yours this morning if you see that's yours you only take that much don't venture to brother Benz parts the other brothers and sisters pass on Finch internets just be happy living in all that God's it is yours not 50% but all that yours enough yours is only a small part living all the small parts it was a greater part living all the greater my and the profit makes us an amazing thinkers remember showing you that fasting is not a but it not a chore it's not for you to go home now brain was hard enough the Prophet said people wouldn't miss port and fast victory he says I went read the question long one but here's a man wrote a book this isn't the message the Intervale 1956 a man wrote a book about fasting and he says that he had a picture of a woman on the cover and before she began her forty day fast apparently she looked a certain way but after the forty day fast she looked 20 years younger and everybody read the book or the woman read the book and they saw the picture of this young looking woman on the cover and they thought and they begin to fast for 40 days he's woman they because they they believe this because remember the inspiration behind the book was that Jesus fasted forty days and so the man writes a book on the power of this kind of fast here is a young looking woman so everybody wants to lose some years and in the prophecies this so they began a faster forty days as is some of them with false plates and their teeth would drop out and their eyes would sink back and mothers to be woman to be mothers their little ones that you understand they would go completely mentally out and be taken into the institutions many of them come in that condition and the prophecies I believe in fasting certainly but when you fast you don't hunger ah Jesus after he got through fasting the Bible says he was hungry that means you're not putting yourself into a fast yeah it's an automatic thing think about this we continue say you've got a nice roast you're really looking for we're all hungry the fragrance of it is coming through the oven you're ready that eats like we were last know we really that eats but imagine the phone rings where all we are just ready to eat and the phone rings are we here tragedy in the family yeah loved one just been killed hunger gone automatic fast just lay your burdens you are burning because this relates to you often you don't feel that way when it's tragedy about somebody else but when it starts getting home boom straight into a fast see that yeah now we're understanding a bit more aren't we yeah how these things work the men and the prophecies he certainly captured the woman the man that did they wrote the book and it says all these things fasting is an anointing it's a time where you were denying the flesh to get alone with God now what I want to show you is there's three levels of fasting and that fast that Jesus had was the highest level of fasting there are two other levels the Prophet said in perseverance 1962 yesterday I was sitting in the room usually Friday is a fast day for me I don't eat on sometimes Tuesdays and Fridays till sometime in the afternoon that's he said that's not a regular fast that's just a couple of days a week too fast so a longer fast comes in more days when the Lord puts it upon you but this type of fast he's talking about that's just an respects and honor of God's great Memorial to us the fasting a command and so after three o'clock usually I have something lights now watch there is fasting out of respect to God's Word and when he would fast out of respected God's Word he would put primer say to just spend alone in the scripture in prayer it's not eating maybe to the early afternoon 3 o'clock then he might have something to eat in the fastest finish and he's hungry because it's not an anointing it's out a respectable word and during Tiny's he's devoting himself to the presence of God this is not something where you'd go to work in your fasting right this is when you're taking time aside the spin in the presence of God and you're hungry because it's not anointing it's respect to the word that's the lowest level of fasting very brief not even a full thing this respect God honors his word now watch that's the lowest level when Jesus went to the wilderness to be tempted he did not go too fast I mean they went quick I mean he did not go there too fast he went there because he was led by the spirit to be tempted and when he's when he's there being tempted he's not eating and he's unconscious of the fact he's not eating nor drinking he's oblivious to the fact that he's in a fast and after he withstands the devil by the word that he's trended then the Bible says after what he wasn't hunger let me say that again the devil tempted a mouthing was a hunger but after the anointing of the fast came off him and he was hungry that's when the devil tempted him but he did not go too fast it was an anointing that was upon him right when Moses went up into Mount Sinai to receive the law and the instruction on how to build the tabernacle he did not go there too fast he went there because God instructed him to go on up and when he's receiving revelation from God he goes into an automatic fast because he's there for 40 days and 40 nights and neither ate nor drank and he's not hungry the highest level when Elijah was fleeing from Jezebel in the Book of Kings and the angel prepared a meal for Elijah the Bible says Elijah went and the strength of that meal for forty days do you know Elijah was not intending to fasts he just ate a meal and that was it for forty days it's an anointing it's an anointing that is the highest level and you may never experience once in your life but that is a level of fasting that exists then the second level of fasting is what Daniel experienced and dangled Tim Daniel was burdened because the angel things have been revealed to him in the word and he's burdened about what he's singing the word and the Bible says he's seeking the will of God and the Bible says that he ate no Pleasant bread for 21 days the only thing he's not eating his Pleasant bread he's eating unleavened bread but not Pleasant bread so he's still having a little food in water over 21 days but the whole appetite to eat normally is not there because of the burden that he has to receive from the angel then after 21 days II angel comes down Gabriel comes down and apologizes for the delay and then after he has revealed certain things the fast is over and is back to eating normally again that is the second level of fasting that is why when you are burdened about something this is now beyond respects to God's Word you just have your whole focus is Lord know what I'm needing something I need a response I neither I need to draw from you and it takes away the appetite you might sip a little water and have a little cracker here and there just to keep you going but the main appetites not there that's the second level of fasting those are the three levels below assist respect God's Word not even a day to take time alone with God just to think on his word commune with them the second level is your burdens you might eat a little something here until the Lord comes on the scene and settles your heart the effort I pretends and the highest level is when there is an anointing God comes down there is no thought there's no hunger there's no thirst there's nothing you understand that this morning so is it difficult it's so simple isn't it it's an inconvenient no it's not God would put rigors on us why there's people who worship their foreign gods make trips to Mick and prays five times a day and all these the mines and that's so faithful and all we have to do is push the pedal in our cars and come to church and it's too hot oh why how did the burden come on Daniel Daniel was looking in the word yeah he was seeing what was written in the word and he wanted that see the word be reality he wanted to be in the place where the word was at amen he wanted to make the angel and when he prepared his heart when he got serious about what he was seeing the angel came he was reading The Book of Jeremiah here in about 70 years in Babylon and his burdens and Gabriel comes down to tell them about 70 weeks how does the angel come Prince you want to meet the angel think admit the angel how does the angel come down desperation serious go beyond the veil of Pilate election manna to go beyond all that's and it and watch the aims let the presence of God coming down your little candidates and that's where you can stay there for 40 minutes one hour two hours three days whatever you'll just stay there and he can minister to you once you finish talking and pouring out yourself just wait who's the angel friends I was telling this last night who is Gabriel who is Gabriel who's Michael I will tell you right now Michael and Gabriel Jesus Christ every time Gabriel appears in the Bible he is the giver of Revelation so right Daniel 8 he's revealing the vision of the RAM and he goes Daniel 9 he's revealing about the 70 weeks Daniel 10 is telling about the the battle between the Prince of Persia and the things that will unfold he comes to Zacharias and Luke 1 and he discerns the condition of Elizabeth your wife is barren she's old stricken in years but will bring forth an angel with discernment an angel who gives revelation who is this angel all through the Old Testament Scott the angel of the Lord he does not have a name but by the Book of Daniel he's given a name Gabriel a man every time Daniel saw him what did he see a man he described a man and that man was God Gabriel as the give of revelation comes to Mary you will bring forth the son you know that was God announcing his own birth Gabriel was God standing there telling Mary about when he's going to be born now let me tell you this in 1946 who appeared to the Prophet Gabriel but I thought it was Jesus Christ who was with the Prophet who's Jesus Christ who was it that discerned the names and the addresses and the conditions of every single person was it brother Branham no was it God was God wasn't it but what's God's name in that position when he's the giver of revelation what's his name Gabriel he was a man that stepped out of the ball of fire do you realize before he was a man he was the pillar of fire that appeared in the log cabin in 1906 and hovered above the bed of the Prophet he was a ball of fire and then when the proper was seven years of age that ball of fire is now a whirlwind that speaks a talking world winds then in 1946 and dreams more Indiana in a cave here is the ball of fire and out all that steps a man whose voice is the same as the whirlwinds so who is this man it must be the pillar of fire it must be God himself Jesus Christ appearing in these last days as Gabriel who is the giver of Revelation so who's Michael Jesus Christ the protector of his word every time Michael is seen in the Bible Daniel chapter 12 he's there to deliver the names written in the book it's your name written in the book he's there to deliver the names hallelujah when he's seen in Jude there's a contention between the devil and Michael about the body Moses its confrontation and Michael says the Lord rebuke thee Satan revelation 12 it's a war between Lucifer and Michael it's warfare God standing for his word God standing for his people the protector of his revelation God changing office depending on what he wants to achieve mine where do we first read about Michael in the Bible Michael comes to help Gabriel Daniel was in prayer 21 days fasting wanting the Lord to come my angel Lord send the angel and Gabriel finally turns up and he apologizes he says gate Daniel I'm sorry but for 21 days the Prince of Persia who is the devil withstood me and I he could not prevail as Gabriel / the devil and their office so what does Gabriel have to do change form and become Michael and as Michael the devil is driven back and it becomes Gabriel and speaks to Daniel is that so hard you talk about one God but the Prophet come in these last days to reveal who God is but the prophets say God is not one like that yeah why because in Revelation 4 it's 1 God on the throne but the seven spirits of the one God before the throne and the four cherubims of the one God before the throne but I thought there's only one God there is only one God who can reveal himself in Menna four offices hallelujah that one purifier became a hundred and twenty licks of fire in the upper room one God became seven heavenly angels that formed the cloud in 1963 that was the seven spirits of God in the form of a cloud revealing one God hallelujah so who is the mighty angel that came down in Revelation 10 Gabriel himself the giver of revelation the angel appearing to those who are looking for him those who are needing him to come he's descended on an age level but he has to descend for personally to me and that's what your prayer life is all about to bring Gabriel into your little big chamber that little campus bring him there now when you're walking Gabriel is with you when you're speaking Gabriel speaks Amen when you're sick you don't need to open Missy you need Jehovah Rapha when there's something that you need you need more than Jehovah Shalom I want God as Jehovah Jireh I need God to manifest himself in a specific office to meet my need when he was the son of God a spirit being he cannot shed his blood in that office so he changes farmer becomes a son of man and in that farm he can shed blood the penny of what he must achieve in his office he changes form becomes that tooth of thorns simple isn't it we're thinking about all these angels and it's one God revealing himself in different forms this angel who's appeared to us and these last days Saints is Gabriel himself Jesus Christ a person of the Holy Ghost has appeared for us when does he appear when there's fellowship winners and since the golden altar was where the incense was offered the incense is the prayers when the prayers are going up before the Lord the angel appears where was the Prophet when Gabriel appeared in his cave praying where was Daniel when Gabriel appears alone praying where was that cariah's when Gabriel appeared offering incense and the people were outside praying to where and when is the angel going to come when there's prayer when this fellowship when there is communion with God this Gabriel ceases to be a figment of your imagination and is a living reality walking and speaking through you you know where the golden altar was placed it was placed just before the Holy of Holies was the last piece of furniture before you go into the hole what brings you closest to God what will bring you the very presence of God my hope a man and the smoke goes up and will blankets it will blanket the sanctuary it will blanket your home will blanket your life you are enveloped by a supernatural atmosphere or incense the Prophet said in the Victory Day 1963 you realized before the Prophet would step out in front of the people to preach the word he prayed first prayer Satan you can't do nothing to me I come in the name of the Lord Jesus you see something happens you're covered in the incense you're covered in your prayer and you can walk out the fake them cannot do anything against you Gabriel can step into that kind of atmosphere yes God don't appear at the rock concert God don't appear there but he will appear with is the right worship yeah you've been hearing about worship in this church Evan G well pray and worship is the same thing that's why when we sing that our singing us to match the preaching of the word oftentimes if we preached how we send out their journey and the Junction's that they win through what God's doing not in America not in German and Africa but here in Wellington not not in Taranaki but here in Wellington we sing about what the word is achieving Amen let's be covered with Craig covered with that incense and the secret to as I wrap this up that's relief for those of you who are wondering but not to see to commune with and if we just sit spill and let him answer us back many things and one of the horrible things that I do I will try I try to do all the talking and not sit still long enough for him to answer me back oh we do that so many times in prayer I think he what he would say back to us and sometimes I've did that and my whole opinion was changed you see I'd go to him ask him something now Lord these people really been it's changed altogether sometimes somewhere else just commune with the Lord oh what glorious fellowship just to get down and talk and commune and wait for him to talk back do we do that Oh My isn't that where we fall short we do all the talking amen we're ripping cuz when he comes he can show you how you make this right maybe that faith that you're wanting in your life will come if you just say too much in haste and leaves and never lets you speak that that's how the voice happens naturally you talk to one another yeah but you don't do that with God you present your list of demands all these things that you want to get sorted out to start your day because it's quite inconvenient being in this place but when the word becomes much more real to you this is not about you even going before God with anything but you want yeah you're not even thinking about that you just thank you Jesus praise your name thank you for watching can I tell you for many of us some of us may be where there's been no prayer life if there's a lot of things to thank the Lord for I'll tell you when you get down and you've been out of fellowship with the Lord for a long time you'll be staying there a long time when you go in as president is a lot of porking do a lot of things to think of or a lot of things to make right you know what happens when there is this rich constant fellowship of God when you go before the Lord the second time in the third phone now you can start looking at the new territory yeah because you've got all those other things out of the way yes if a laborer and his present you spoken about these things we've conversed about this and that he's spoken back to me now we can look at other things now we can start addressing my shortcomings or things I would like to see or but the home I'd like to buy all these other things you get address because all that bet lock their backlog of undone business now you can just really spend time fellowshipping in a deeper level for many of us even this morning for some of us where dad is just going to fall the Lord making things right lay it out before all your burdens or your vexations or your should get straight sort out things with God get on the straight and narrow with God once that's all laid out then when you come before him again you can start looking at these things start addressing other things you see how it is but often all it is if we come before the Lord oh I need this and be with me today and be with mum and be and be just shallow stuff we're talking about getting alone pouring it out pouring it out that's so rich amen and sometimes that kind of rich prayer might only be ten minutes another day it might be an hour might be two hours might be five minutes just when it's done and you're satisfying the Lord is satisfied get up amen some days you will be in a channel to pray there are days where I'm in a channel to pray there are other days I'm not in a channel whether you're in the channel or out of the channel breakthrough PMS breakthrough bring flesh to the wood good soldiers of Jesus Christ we have trouble praying have you done like praying tell the Lord what I hate it I can't stand it I don't like coming to church I don't enjoy reading the Bible tell them you already knows how many times have I picked up the Bible and read Ezekiel and by the second verse and completely lost no idea what it's talking about well the dates and the language confused why don't stand it it's too complicated but no idea what it's talking about help me to understand and then when you go on your journey when you go on your journey through life in musicians will come when you go through your journey we could make it play into my chamber be free Holy Spirit this journey that you are on it's between you and the Lord right it's not so that for you to compete with each other better who's where who's the more in advance whose arm or River later that's not what it's about it's a personal journey the Lord might reveal one thing to you today you might not be a patch on understanding things like somebody else's most about knowing him see being in his will where he wants you to be that's that's how you want to walk and so we want to I trust take these things go and think on these things get away from the kids get away from the husband wife some time now these things you cannot always do I'm talking about this private prayer you cannot always do it sometimes just not convenient but when there is the opportunity take it but there's opportunity this afternoon tonight for you whenever take it get alone with God maybe between Monday and Friday it's just you are just so busy as you are but when you get alone with God say Lord I have made my life so busy I have so many demands on me lord I cannot reengineer I cannot change it can I give you my full schedule and I'm asking that you were adjusted though I might have to work 12 hours a day and then sit with the kids and read them their stories and sit with a wife and talk to her and keep everybody happy Lord when I do all that I have no time a lord you reengineering so I have time this is why the prophets said if I could read this this quote about Martin Luther he says he was a man given too much prayer and he learned that the more work he had to do and the more solely he was pressed for time the more of his time he gave to God in prayer in order to ensure satisfactory results that is so not what we are taught the more that's required of you the tighter your schedule is spend more time in prayer just stay there to watch all that other stuff God supernaturally arranges it because what your desire God is first you honor me say at the water only you amen just being a help to us [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen if there are things that we do not understand fully this morning I for this afternoon listen to the recording there are things that you do not understand at all just wait there are things that I've said that you disagree with just wait wait a year wait five years wait until the revelation comes in you're seeing there are things I've asked the Lord about owners weren't I've waited 10 years to get an answer but when it came it was so straightforward so simple how could I not see it we're all at different levels sometimes when we preach were preaching seeing the vision here but often the people are only at this level and they only see things that they're live you're seeing a greater picture but wait to spend time with the Lord let them raise you higher and higher and high and suddenly when I'm when you hear about Gabriel again you go yeah yeah I remember five years ago I didn't agree with what their brother said but I see it now because the Lord has shown any man I see it's my brother by email not long ago just leave it alone pray about it don't even think about it and let God reveal it yeah [Music] the song into my chamber to the closets be frijoles it's let's sing that song into my chamber [Music] speak to me gently speak to me chef as high Emilie
