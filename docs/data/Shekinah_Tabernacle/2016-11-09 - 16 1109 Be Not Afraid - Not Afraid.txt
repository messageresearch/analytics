is where they going for so we're gonna pay for this church I guess I anyway praise Lord let's ghost go to Genesis chapter 3 and verses 8 to 10 just everyone's had a blessed day spite of whatever you may be facing we're blessed amen good too heavy line here with us and God bless you sister savage always wonderful to see you god bless you so Genesis 38 verse 8 2 verse 10 and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden Anna and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and head myself let's just go to let's go to Matthew chapter 14 and we just jumping right into the story of Jesus walking on the water and Peter walking on the water I'm going to read from verse 24 down to verse 27 let's read from verse 22 and straight away Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and goat and to go before him onto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with him tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it's a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight away Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid amen my lord bless the word you may have your seats I want to I want to take those three words be not afraid you know it's amazing when you think about it where Jesus sent his disciples on the boat he was the one who commanded them to go there but then the very one that they were they were looking for to follow them walked out upon the water to them and they were scared you know that there was the wind and the waves in the and the boat was tossed and you know the they were the disciples maybe they were concerned about the about the weather but then when the God that they were following in the God that they were serving came into their midst they were afraid the very one who could have delivered them the very one who created the winds and the sea had come to them and they were scared they were afraid and it's amazing when you know Adam Adam before we read there in Genesis chapter 3 he was never afraid he he never feared it never came near his mind or as imagination what it was like to be scared and never came into his minor imagination what it would be like to be afraid of the very God he loved but yet we understand son came into the picture and and suddenly man had a bunch of emotions they had never experienced before and we see that the very God that came to help him that same one they were scared off because we it's incredible the one that could deliver them from this situation here there were he was God over the earth God had made him bus and he had fallen and the only one who could restore him back to that position was looking for him in the garden the only one that could help him was looking for him in the garden and he was afraid of him amen it sounds a bit crazy but this is man's condition man's condition is always afraid of the one that can help them man's condition as always they try and do it themselves and we understand if you read that whole chapter three they sewed fig leaves together they made aprons and they cover their sin and we understand a religion as a covering I meant they made their own religion and it was covering there very soon and they thought they will find until the very God that made them came into the image and they recognize that their own ability did not cover or undo what had happened and they were afraid of the one that could fix the problem it's incredible how you say well what is this what does this got to do with me in my situation very simple many times we were afraid we're afraid of God hey with me I know it's a wednesday no there's not many of us here but many times we were afraid of the god that can help us amen because you know God wants to take all fear away from his children he wants to totally annihilate any instance of fear or being afraid of the God that can help you because Adam knew that God was a man of God of his word and he said the day the ether of the day you shall die and he understood that and so he was afraid that the God that made him now was what could have destroyed them but he did not understand that man was a part of God if you're a son or daughter of god you're a part of him just like your natural children are a part of your parents and your children are part of your parents you cannot disown your parents in any way you know that could that it could be actually proven that you don't come out of them it's impossible they take a blood test you take a blood test DNA matches I meant out of 7 billion people in the world however many percent you know of the age bracket of childbearing age and male and female you could not be matched to another parent amen if you took the day DNA of every parent upon the earth the match would be perfect and you could not deny your parents and your parents could not deny you they could say no they're not my children but the blood evidence proves that you are related and the blood evidence proves that you are their offspring I mean you cannot you cannot in any way change the evidence and Adam when he fell he forgot that he came out of God I mean when he fell from his position he forgot that he was part of the very God that was walking down among them hearing the voice in the garden and he was afraid and now here we come and we're born in sin shaped iniquity come to the world speaking lies and we have no idea where we're from we have no idea you know we think this is my culture this is my nation this is maybe the church I go to this is what I believe but then when God comes upon the scene and he opens your eyes that is more than just a mental understanding i come from God I go back to God but it comes a revelation into your soul I come from God and I go back to God because I'm a part of God amen so and that now should take all fear away because God does not want you to be afraid of him God does not want you to be scared of him doesn't matter what condition urine he does not want you to be afraid but the greatest tool the devil uses us fear and brother Brown says the greatest paralysis and the church today is fear amen that man is afraid of the very god they worship down Israel in the church part 1 this has been the greatest thing I found among Christian people throughout the entire world has been affair they're always afraid when a little sickness strikes they're afraid many I wonder sometimes and now I'm along with you but now what I'm trying to do tonight and in this week to come as try to drive that fear away by God's Word now you would come to me and say well brother BAM I believe this now I believe that there's only one way in the world to proof now I can't go by somebody's experience somebody's church ritual there's only one proof of what it's all about that's God's Word now if God's words here's a certain thing then I've got to believe that that is the truth I want to leave that quote there I wish I put it up but you must understand the devil remember God wants you to know who you are amen your homework for the rest of the week is to listen to who is this Melchizedek you must listen to the service before sunday because I'm going to go on to some things and I trust it just a blur I'm going to just lay a bit of a foundation kind of tonight but I want you to really listen to it because I want you to see well I trust the Holy Spirit rule will reveal to you who you are and it will destroy all fear doesn't matter if you're on the mountain or if you're in the valley you are victorious over everything all the mind battles are wearing you down it's irrelevant amen you must see who you are and it'll take out all the fear just a simple just a simple fact that we are the children of the Lord amen should take all the fear away Adam was afraid now I just want to I want to keep my marquee I want to come back to this quote but now this word afraid and that they're really bound Genesis was to fear it means it means to revere it's a course to be frightened to be made afraid to be fearful so they were fearful of the very of the very God made them now job I want to just go into I distrust I hope this all comes together in but now Adam and Adam was afraid because he was in a fallen state but he is still a son of God but here's it but he forgot that fact he was afraid that because he had fallen God was going to destroy him but God can't destroy his children all that the father has given me Jesus had already given me will you know all that the father has given me a mine I can't mean to the scripture verbatim and all that country or no wise cast out amen so he's saying they already been given and they're going to come to me and all that country I'll no wise cast out a mean so Jesus already has a set number and he's not going to lose one none of God's children are going to be lost it's impossible they cannot be lost you cannot be lost amen it's impossible you cannot go down in defeat now remember victory and circumstance are two different things victory is I've been redeemed by the blood of lamb nothing's held against me in this world of the next that's victory jesus paid it all and I receive it amen someone say hallelujah amen you've got to push this home come on friends we're gonna have church tonight amen we got understand that is victory there's nothing held that there's no evidence against you it's been annihilated it's been washed by the blood lamb the enemy has no evidence against you I mean you never did in the first place you justified the first place is God's mind when he thought of you amen but this message came for you to realize you never did it in the first place as for you to realize that you're justified in God's mind before the foundation of the world when he thought of you he didn't think of your struggles and your mind battles and the sin you're born with and what every that you're carrying he didn't think of you that way he saw you redeemed mature made his image washed in his blood hallelujah virtuous righteous bright of Christ that's how he saw you and he wants you to know that I mean he wants you to recognize who you are and so joke so Adam forgot just because he had fallen he forgot now God is going to destroy them but God could not destroy them that's why he brought in Redemption and he gave them the promise the seed of the woman is going to bruise the head of the seed of the serpent hallelujah in other words i'm going to come and flesh and i'm going to undo everything that just happened this day and he didn't just speak it in words he covered them in lambskins hallelujah pointing to the redeemer coming and he covered this covered their sin hallelujah so they had evidence they had evidence that their sin was going to be done away with and now the Bride of Christ has evidence hallelujah the bride has the Holy Ghost I mean has concrete evidence hallelujah that your sins been taken care of we're not looking forward to them coming we're looking back thanking him buddy did come amen and now you individually have evidence God is alive God is real God has transformed me God dwells in me by His Holy Spirit amen you have evidence hallelujah they're lambskins eventually if they didn't look after them the leather gets hard and cracked and you got to replace it the Holy Ghost doesn't get old cracked and need replacing Alleluia now job so as I said victory is different to circumstance we can just go to Hebrews chapter 11 alicious go to Hebrews 11 very quickly and I want to read this because many times we think of victory as everything goes fine there's no mind battles even near you you victorious over everything there's no hardship there's no struggles you just crest every wave amen people think oh if I if I the Holy Ghost or if I see the devil tries to make you doubt your experience he tries to make you doubt what you have and he comes along and says well if you really had the Holy Ghost you would Crist every year just to feed every enemy you'd never have a hardship you never ever mind battle you'd never fall amen remember there's sin unbelief but this little sin which are things you do and we sent every day we must make mistakes every day but if the life of God is in you you won't continue down that way Donald director you know something he found the Dubs flan somewhere I mean like brother been told i think dawson Riley or I think I got his name right either the father all the saints like the holy ghost grieving the Holy Ghost is like he's like a dove it flies up into the rafters doesn't mean you're not sealed doesn't mean you're lost but he just waits there then you repent and make a right then he comes back again amen as possible to grieve the Holy go that doesn't mean you're not safe that doesn't mean you're not redeemed because remember we still live in these bodies and so wait you're here we were now let's go to verse 36 because many times we love to read no this is brief in verse 32 and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon at a barrack and of Samson and of Jeff thee and of David and Samuel on of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escape edge of the sword out of weakness was made strong way expelling in the fight turned the flight of the armies of the aliens woman received their dead race to life again the others were okay let's stop there that sounds that sounds incredible like Rambo coming and just gunning down everyone doesn't it that sounds pretty spectacular and many times we think now that's a hero of faith hey I'll just say a min for me that's right Amen but now others now this is the other side others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a bit of resurrection and others had trial of cruel mocking and scourging 'he's yay MERVA of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword saw they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented now that doesn't sound now now I understand why didn't you see her here big Universal hallelujah because that doesn't sound that glamorous but these are the heroes of the faith these are people like you who overcame in their age I mean these are the ones that didn't fear and whether you like it or not we are part of this number amen so someone who's destitute afflicted and tormented and in my margin tormented there means evil treated you know those that were they had trial of cruel mocking and scourging and so on that's that that's the believer their circumstances then does not sound all that glamorous yes you with me their circumstances are not sound that glamorous but many times we we don't differentiate victory to situation amen because if we look at situation one day we're having a glorious time next day it's getting hard and we're not doing all something's wrong nothing's wrong everything's running smoothly God's programs running perfectly just right but you got to look at the difference between your situation in your victory amen there's a brother in Canada is in the police force he lost everything is depressed he was down his life had fallen apart is a believer I think I come in but he lost his family or what happened but he was at the lowest part of his life and then this woman that was working the police force just came in maybe work in the same office I can't member the details but she said I see God in you what do you believe she had traveled to India she had been all around the world looking for something real and here was a believer in the last part of his life it says I see God in you and then he took her to the church and she says no I see God in everyone and she became a believer amen the situation was terrible but his victory was victorious amen now if you now if we could go back to that brother's life and talk to him at that moment how are you feeling when you effectively lead that sister to the Lord he would have said brother I had such a prayer before hand and God just came down and everything was going perfect and the wood was just opening us shouting and rejoicing and everything was going well it's say I hate it I hated my life at that point if he has on us do you see I hate I hated waking up that morning and wake up saying I'm still in this trial hello that was the situation it wasn't as his victory amen now it's not always like that you must understand but I'm trying to get you to see it doesn't matter what condition you find yourself in a min if you have the victor you have the victory it is what it is amen so don't never mix the two because that's when the mind battles come is when the hard hard times come and then the devil can get you think well maybe I'm maybe I'm not where I think I am amen never take never belittle what God has done for you I meant never let him belittle it because if he can do that in then the mine battles begin to win Amen hallelujah now job God's testimony of his servant job was this is a perfect man there's none like him in all the earth I don't know how many million people were upon the earth at that time but there's one without without equal without equal upon the earth that was Joe was it not let's read it in job chapter one remember this is you you you I I trust us help someone I say God destroy the fear there should be no more fear amen because ultimately we're not afraid of the devil we're afraid of the Lord amen ultimately because you don't walk before the devil but you work for the Lord you want to please him so you don't care what he says ultimately you care what does the Lord think of me and so the devil can get you to be afraid of God then that's where the trouble comes up amen his joke there was a man in the land of us thank you whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and the 11 that fed God and eschewed evil that fear is I believe it's a reverential fear not a thing in being terrified so let's go down to and there was born unto him seven sons and three daughters now this has dropped down to seven and eight this is where so this is this is job jobs divine commentary perfect man upright one that fed God and eschewed evil and then Satan goes up before the Lord and the Lord points his finger down to job well this is read verse 7 and the Lord said under Satan wits come us now then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro on the earth and walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant job now I know I've said these things many times before but I want to sink in have you considered my servant job there's none like them in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and ask you earth evil and then and then then they have the discourse after that but see this is god this is what God thought of joke this was God's testimony you know when we think of a brother assist from the church would say you know someone you admire you say what a what a model believe such an encouragement and the hard times just the Lord just you you're such a great example of what you know of God's grace and God looks down and he sees his servant job memek God sees all things any any calls things exactly as they are he doesn't elaborate he doesn't exaggerate he doesn't diminish he just says exactly exactly as he says that thats how it is and so here's a perfect man but Joe had fear because he didn't understand who he wasn't got a meant he had fear because we're it there that job had seven sons and three daughters and job himself would say and job through 25 for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me and that was his family died he did initially care about his flocks remember one of the things one of his Clemmie T's was all of his children in a house and the house fell upon them and they all died and he sacrificed every time they you know your heat heat he offered a lamb on their behalf continually a mint but he was he was he was giving the sacrifice out of fear instead of confidence he was motivated by fear and stead of confidence that the lamb works they meant as part of his life was dictated to by fear and he said the thing that he feared came upon him and you got to be careful because there's power on the tongue there's power in the tongue so the things that you fear and you express they will materialize because you begin to believe your fear I meant you begin to leave your fear instead of believing the word of God that's why the things you fear you know don't let it grip you in such a way that you begin to believe your fears amen because as soon as fear comes into the equation you got to kick it out cuz fear torment and torment and fear is not of God because this word fear and hearing job that means to be startled by a sudden alarms as I just shocks you hence to fear and general be afraid standing or being fair to make shake the same startled startle them there's what he is afraid of what if this happened what if my children died lost not under the blood is living in fear and it's fear now they were under the blood because he offered the lamb on their behalf he was being a good parent amen but he did it out of fear instead of out of confidence I want you to think about this what he feared came to pass because he believed his fear and he spoken and if the devil can make you fear it disarms your faith either your faith will paralyze the fear the devil tries to put upon you or your fear will paralyze your faith that all the Pens who you're listening to just because job had fear here still perfect man remember victory conditions I meant his condition was I'm afraid for my children he was looking at situation because they were feasting and things go from house to house is worried what if they do something evil what if I do something against the Lord that he was afraid of the what could be that's why the imagination can be such a glorious thing but such a curse because Satan push that button here's the what could be comes out on the big screen 4k video I've never I don't know you know I definition or even virtual reality now become so alive and real and it gets is the what could be and it's never good a menace never it's never the you're going to take a body change and all your family will come in and God's just in you and we have glorious church times and prayer times at home and witnessing in the hole it's never that kind of imagination it's this is going to go wrong and you see what's already happening because this is going to happen and this is what you did and this is this and God's not really real and doesn't really love you and if you really loved you this wouldn't happen and you know all these kind of things go on and he's a consuming fire and he's also a god of Wrath even though he's a God of love but he's a god of Wrath and he's going to punish you for what you did and all the figures do-do-do-do-do-do-do down like this I'm just talking about myself but you know what I mean this is what happened and you go so you got to think now when something comes into your mind you think what's motivating this and where's really the conclusion i meant as the as the conclusion joy love peace long-suffering something that comforts you something that guides you something that settles you something that increases your faith or your love for God or is it fear so we have to what job feared came upon him because he was looking at circumstance and the what could be amen he was applying he was killing now this is just me but he was sacrificing for his children out of fear they meant instead of applying the token and confidence amen but God now God had to come to job and he cuz job didn't understand here he is a perfect man without without peer and he didn't even know that he thought was just regular Joe Bloggs they love the Lord people came to him you know ask them for advice is blessed financially all these things are going well and he attributed all that to the Lord but he's really forgot what he was he didn't even know what he was he didn't even know where should his last breath levers lips where he was going to go and then the whole trial happened because God came down to him spoke to him in a whirlwind I want you to see something's job this ties into milk is attackin Abraham I mean Jesus came who was Melchizedek made flesh the communion I'm just going to drop a few things in for Sunday the communion that symbolizes God giving a part of himself to you the bread and the wine he's giving a part of himself to you because he wants you to be where he is and now Melchizedek other branches wasn't a theophany body and Paul says if this tabernacle be dissolved I've one waiting already eternal in the heavens so God had to come down in time to link us without the off anybody okay now i'm going to go into this on sunday but this all I just a little just anointed in such a way that you'll just be fearless walking out of this place they meant so God God comes and he gives us would which is himself to you and it anchors into your soul because he wants you to recognize I have a body in the heavens amen there's a part of me waiting if I leave this body I have an eternal one and this message has come for you to recognize you have a body waiting if we all if this whole work building was vaporized right now we're step into that glorified into that theophany body so I don't want to mix it too but you know we have a body waiting we have a body waiting and God has come this way that's why God came to job what a job say after the great trial now i know my Redeemer liveth and with these eyes I'll see him and in the last hour stand upon the earth with them that's not verbatim what he said but that's what he said he said with these eyes I'll see God and other skin was a sort you know destroy this flesh with these eyes I'll see God he says I know my Redeemer liveth he didn't didn't know anything about a redeemer Erie chapter you're the first part of job he didn't know anything about Redemption I think God came to him amen where were you job when the stars of you know sons of gods that your shadow for joy and all these things the foundation of the earth was later where were you and God is trying to get job to see you there you were there shouting you're there victorious you're there shouting and praising me and now I saw that an eternity but now I want it to be expressed at the time that your condition before the world began would be manifested in flesh upon the earth hallelujah and that's why job now he could say there's more to this world than this I have a Redeemer amen so now he can see job and that to halt the fair away because he had questions and if the devil puts a question in your heart it's fair voice fear involved how do you know you have the Holy Ghost how do you know you're going in a rapture but he puts a question there and there's always fear attached to their question how do you know you're going to get well how do you know this is not going to take your life there's a question there's my brother brown me know put out the book do you fear cancer shouldn't fear cancer but his fear always associated with cancer amen now going back to the quote I want to be much longer recently deals a young minister came to me and told me of a certain situation said he prayed over it and he said the Lord revealed to him that it was a certain way now when i read this really think no i just read it and I looked at them a little bit and said brother that's very lovely I appreciate the Lord doing that for you but let me tell you something its contrary he said well the vision came from God I said it couldn't have rather because it was contrary to the word now we must prove all things by the scripture if it's contrary to my faith and yet the scripture says so the scriptures right and I'm wrong see the scriptures always right and the only way you can do anything is come back to the scripture it says now is that true I like to hear you say Amen when you believe it you see so now this is us the devil comes to you and you have mine battles and you're wrestling something and the conclusion of voices argument is you're not right with God amen this is this is some of the matter and if you agree with him now he says if your faith if my faith is contrary to the scripture the scripture is right and I'm wrong so if you begin to believe you're not right with God then that's your faith because you believe it but you have to take it back to what does the scripture say about me what does the word say about me not what I feel about me says about me what does the word say about me amen are you following me because that's why he says the scripture is always right amen and so if the scripture says repent and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive to the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise under you and to your children those that are far off Evans meetings the Lord our God shall call is that right that's right who's ever call you know who's ever calls upon the name of Lord shall be saved in Romans chapter 10 says how can you hear on this is a preacher sent now going to be be sent unless he's been ordained to be sentient you know all those things so there's a there's a program God and God sends a minister and he anoints that ministry and he speaks through that ministry then faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God and then you can call upon the name of Lord because God is working in the soul you say lord save me it's already been done on calorie but then you accept it amen and then you come God's provided way yeah and what does that mean now so so remember when Jesus died it was wiping your sin debt past present and future soon amen did he not he didn't have to die again he didn't have to shed any more blood again by one offering he has perfected them forever that a sanctified the scripture says so if he did that now and then here you are two thousand years down the road and God send a messenger to the age revealed the light of the word to him that same anointing comes upon a ministry and then you hear the words of that ministry and the Bible becomes alive to you amen and it changes your life see the devil doesn't like to remember the time he got defeated in your life the devil doesn't like to remind you the time smoking or whatever the world or drinking or whatever was was cast out of you the devil doesn't like to remind you of the fact one day he was on your throne he used to be upon the throne of your heart but then he got dethroned and the king of kings came in that's what the gospel is to do is to dethrone Satan wherever he he you know whoever will listen and God come upon the throne of the heart halloo you talk about a coup a min but really it's a Redemption it's a restoration of the human soul back into its right condition the devil doesn't like to be reminders days he always tries to sweep it under the carpet yeah amen but if God has done that for you if God has done that for you then you need to look into the scripture and say what does God say about me all right let's go to first John one I'm trying to let's just read this first John one he says this then verse 5 the sin is the message which I have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from say the next word sin all sin all what does all mean the entirety of it the whole amount of it not most of it not some of it not a little bit of it all soon okay if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar in his word is not enough my little children these things are right into that you said not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is a propitiation for our sins and not our not ours only but also for the sins of the whole world amen put that on your fridge put that on your fridge see we have to because remember if there's sin or if there's a question of sin this fear because all the devil dad tries to dangle men be used to do this and you did this and it's so real when you win it when it flashes back sometimes a min and he dangles these things of what happens what happens fear tries to come but little children we should not fear amen because if he has cleanse us from all sin and if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive forgive forgive us of our sins is that right that's what the scripture says so you got to take your faith if your faith is contrary to the to the word then you forget your faith and you take what the scripture says about you now in closing I want to say one of the enemies in the land I can find it one of the enemies in the land was the Hittites now I may get us mixed up with another one but it means terror terror which is greater thing than fear but that was that was what their that's what the country meant was terror he was terror in the promised land and these lights had to come in and they had to conquer that terror I mean they had to overcome that terror that was part of the inheritance they had to overcome it so there's a fear so that's why you say why is the affair try to come in because there's an enemy and he's trying to battle against you remember it's satanic power as trying to hold you back with fear or terror you have to defeat that thing amen you have to overcome those things because we must understand we get sealed into the kingdom but then there's a victory to have these are full inheritance to possess and just because we may fall or fail we'll have all these mind battles it doesn't mean we're not in the land amen you got to take God at his work I've repented I've been baptized I've been sealed with the Holy Spirit I meant that's God's condition you're in the land you can't come out of the land you're in the land amen but then is there's this land to possess these things to overcome and one of those things is fear but if we understand I don't want to be too long I'll just maybe just wrap it up with this job was afraid Adam was afraid it was a man who had perfect fellowship with God and sin came in and now he was afraid then but remember it's just like the disciples on the boat she God comes into the into the garden and the very one that can help Adam and Eve in their predicament they're afraid of and they try and hide from and it's the same thing friends today don't be afraid why does God he doesn't come for destruction he doesn't come for destruction he comes to his children for deliverance I meant if you believe your gods child who believes their gods child amen if you believe your gods child God will only come to you for deliverance what about chastisement everything that is correction with your best intention and mind and the reason that it doesn't is to deliver you from doing it again amen so God always why did God come to Adam and Eve I want to deliver you from those fig leaves I want to give you a promise that I'm going to undo these things why did God come to Moses by the burning bush yeah I mean I mean in the burning bush he didn't want to chastise and say why did you run away 40 years you've been trying to hydrogen me now was the season now deliverances come to my children why did he come to Gideon his Gideon he's afraid of the enemy he's in his own land and he's afraid of the enemy is threshing wheat and secret and God says member that's a situation how does God Sam you're a mighty man of Valor see how we see our sup now it's not being proud you say I was proud to see yourself as this virtuous overcoming sinless perfect you know bride of Jesus Christ that's not proud you got to see what God has made you Caleb and Joshua they did not see themselves as slaves anymore they were once slaves but they weren't slaves anymore they came a time when the slavery was done and they knew they weren't slaves they said let's go take the land because they saw themselves as God saw them but the others still they didn't think they'd still be at a slave mentality because a slave is never greater than the slave as the bottom of the room so how can a slave a nation of slaves overcome these other kingdoms greater than them but Caleb and Joshua they knew our God thought of them by hearing Moses preach these they they understood we have been made a nation of kings and priests this is the promised land this take it at once you know why did it's just all the way through the scripture God comes to his people to bring deliverance don't be afraid of the deliverer amen why did God come to this lukewarm age to bring deliverance amen he didn't come just all he's going to smite the earth with a curse why did he come before widely why hasn't he been spending with a curse yet destroyed because his deliverance in the leg God sealing away as children taking them out of the way then whatever happens after that well that's the people's risk the people made the choice but God sends mercy before he sends judgment brother Bram's preachers sermon God doesn't know God doesn't judge a person without warning them first amen so deliverance comes and yet we're afraid of the deliverance because our situation and our condition we get mixed up and we think God is going to deal with us this is the last time we've crossed the line too many times he must be sick of me and he would have been sick of me long time ago if he wasn't God but he's God and he can't lose a part of himself amen just in 29 and I could keep going but i wanna i want to stop it there you've got to recognize this is you in God's image and God's mind your revelation needs to match what how he sees you and this is why the speak you go you go listen to invisible Union guys listen to that sermon because he's talking about you he's not know when he talks about the invisible union of the bride and Christ and the bride that's been United to the bridegroom he's talking about you amen I trust when you listen to that sermon you say he's talking about me amen sinless virtuous never did in the first place he put a wedding band of premiere predestinated unmerited grace on your finger before the foundation of the world that's what he says I trusted something in you says that's me he's talking about me all the other stuff and blasting all the denomination's whatever I trust you come you don't put yourself there a min I trust you don't you should say he's actually talking about me amen because it's like what was it Elijah Elijah that went to the widow woman Elijah brother Graham says that there would a woman and the Prophet was with the same caliber the same caliber so God sends a spirit of Elijah in the same time to find a bride for the Lord and then now remember it's the word that comes out of the of the Prophet that's Christ yeah the word is Christ it comes into your home you entertain it you look after you enjoy it it comes to you it doesn't come to everyone else Elijah only went till would a woman there's a Gentile didn't go to you nor now see jesus said there's many other widows and that day but he went outside the land because that woman was the same caliber as the Prophet a widow woman not some queen and a palace a widow woman and she said yo yo Elijah comes along and and he says he says what are you doing and she says well I'm getting two sticks i'm going to make a fire i'm going to cook this last bit of bread and then i'm going to leave my son and I going to die this is her condition and he says he says now make me one first for thus says the Lord the oil will never run out in the ER and and and every with the meal and all these things this was her condition but the Prophet tells us they are the same caliber and then Jesus comes into your home he comes to you there are many other churches in the days of Lady ocf anybody came to a place like this and we received them as he was amen and that ended know what does that say not making some big I'm not stretching it too far but it's actually saying now if the message comes to you which is Christ you say yes Lord I love you I love your word your your word I love it above all things I'd rather have it than my next breath amen what is he saying you and Christ are the same caliber amen that's not I trust that's not too hard to swallow you say yeah but I'm struggling and things are hard and I don't know I have all these things going on situation who you really are amen I could play stand here for hours trying to get that one thing sunk in at your situation and your and your your victory with God are two separate things amen it doesn't matter you know people people many times must understand and especially when you know death is only a travel bus to get us where we really want to go ok that the Hebrews 11 says they all died in faith not receiving the promise so they all died in faith and that is the main thing if you go down as long as you go down in faith member situation who you really are if this is not even bought into consideration you'll do well you'll be you you'll do incredibly well but if you bring this into consideration and you forget this you won't do so well you could be destitute on the street your whole world's falling apart your family leave you your church leave you your friends leave you everyone leave you but if you know I'm a son or daughter of god you're doing well that's the most extreme case you could be on death's door everything could be have gone wrong if you know I know in whom I have believed then you're doing very well amen we have the musicians to come don't fear fear not there's a reason why every time an angel brother branham when the angel came the first time the first words that the angel said was fear not and the season in interview and 20th century properly says and then I knew the same voice that had been speaking to me all my life was now speaking to me first time I've ever seen him in physical form amen so he was afraid of the voice that had always spoken to him and it's the same thing with us don't fear Jesus is here I mean the same one that leads and guides us every day that's why Jesus said be not afraid of his eye and the angel comes many times is fear not I've been seeing for the principal mighty God the same amen I mean let's just sing that song be still let's just stand shall we but go go listen or read who is this Melchizedek and I trust on sunday you'll see God has imparted he came down why did he die on the cross because you have and why did he become real why has he come become real to you one reason because you have a body to step into and Weiss communion so special because of symbolizing God gives part of himself and now Jesus maybe I'll he should it's symbolizing he gives part of himself to fulfill the promise of the eight and the reason he does that is because why you're believer because you have a body hmm an eternal body waiting for you when you go from this wall to the ning that's why you're a believer I'm going to expand it on Sunday but I trust I just want to drop these things in just few to ponder why have I been called why do I live the life I live why go back over your testimony what God has done for you why is he done all these things why has he sent the word my way why is he what I feel his presence and love and want to serve them and you know he's more than life to me why is that because you have a body I mean that though this one be dissolved you have one waiting in the heavens I mean they stand shall we and let's just sing this I'm sailing over the stony see the ways the crashing over and the daylight Isaac face [Music] and the
