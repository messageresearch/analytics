[0:14] Heat.
[0:19] Heat.
[2:32] Heat. Heat.
[3:06] Baby.
[4:18] Heat. Heat.
[4:52] Amen. God bless you saints. Welcome to
[4:54] the house of the Lord. Just stand this
[4:56] evening as we open in a word of prayer.
[5:04] Let's bow our heads.
[5:07] Thank you our gracious heavenly father.
[5:09] Lord, that you were with us tonight,
[5:10] Lord, that we could come here knowing
[5:12] that you were sitting here, Lord Jesus,
[5:14] waiting for us, as we came in, Lord, and
[5:16] that you came with us, Lord. And that as
[5:19] we went through our day today, you were
[5:20] with us every step of the way, Lord. And
[5:23] that we never go anywhere without you,
[5:25] holding our hand, Lord. And Lord, I pray
[5:27] that as we've come expected to hear from
[5:29] you once again tonight, Lord, I just
[5:31] pray that you speak through the
[5:32] minister, Lord. Speak to our hearts,
[5:34] Lord Jesus. Give us the mana for the
[5:36] week to come, Lord Jesus. And Lord, I
[5:40] just want to pray that you you be with
[5:42] those that couldn't make it tonight. Be
[5:43] their portion, Lord. May your atmosphere
[5:44] surround them this evening, Lord. And
[5:46] Lord, I pray you bless the songs and the
[5:48] musicians as we play, Lord. May you play
[5:50] through them, Lord. And may your
[5:51] atmosphere feel welcome. I pray it in
[5:53] Jesus name. Amen.
[6:07] Are we up there or are we down here?
[6:12] TV's off. Okay, we'll start with uh
[6:16] verse one.
[6:21] Yes, that one.
[6:27] My mama read a story from the Bible long
[6:31] ago about Shadrach, Meack, and all the
[6:37] how the wicked king commanded they be
[6:40] thrown into the place because they were
[6:44] not bow and then deny their father's
[6:47] name.
[6:49] And mama said the king should upon a
[6:52] balcony so tall. When he looked in, he
[6:56] was shocked by all the things he saw
[6:59] because he thought that he would find it
[7:02] lying dead upon the ground. But instead
[7:06] of three, counted four. I'm walking all
[7:09] around.
[7:11] But I said, "Mama, wait a minute.
[7:14] There's one thing that I must know. If
[7:17] three women and three came out, they wet
[7:20] that man. And I never will forget it.
[7:24] Mama just across the floor. These are
[7:28] the words I heard her say while shouting
[7:31] through the door.
[7:33] Well, she said he's still in. And he's
[7:37] walking in the flame and he'll be there
[7:40] to help you when you call upon his name.
[7:45] And he gets to deliver by his almighty
[7:49] power. I live alone. It's good to know
[7:52] it's so
[7:56] now my friend, you made me destined to
[7:59] face life's hardest flame. But I'm glad
[8:02] that I can tell you through the power of
[8:06] his name. No one flame will touch you.
[8:10] You'll come through it and you'll tell
[8:12] yesterday. Today forever God is still
[8:16] alive and well.
[8:19] We still in the fire and he's walking in
[8:23] the flame and he'll be there to help you
[8:27] when you call upon his name and he can
[8:31] still live upon
[8:34] mighty power. I'll leave alone. It's
[8:37] good to know he's still
[8:43] in.
[8:44] He's walking in the flame and he'll be
[8:48] there to help you when he calls upon his
[8:51] name that he can still live by. Almighty
[8:57] power
[8:59] is good glory to live by.
[9:04] Oh, I'll live long
[9:08] till
[9:19] we are able to go up and take the
[9:22] country
[9:24] to possess the land from Jordan to sea
[9:29] and all the dives. Maybe there are ways
[9:32] to hinder.
[9:34] God will surely give us victory.
[9:39] Oh, sons of God,
[9:42] march forward
[9:45] in the power of the Savior's name.
[9:50] Sons of God,
[9:53] march forward.
[9:56] For Jesus is never
[10:00] your sons of God.
[10:03] March forward.
[10:06] We are more than conqueror than his
[10:09] name.
[10:11] Sons of God
[10:14] mar forward
[10:16] in the power of the Savior's name.
[10:22] We are able to up and take the country
[10:27] to possess the land from Jordan to sea.
[10:32] And though the giants may be there our
[10:35] way to hinder,
[10:37] God will surely give us victory.
[10:42] Oh sons of God,
[10:45] march forward
[10:48] in the power of the Savior's name.
[10:53] Sons of God
[10:56] mar
[10:59] for Jesus is ever the same. Hallelujah.
[11:04] Son of God.
[11:09] We are more stronger than his name.
[11:14] Sons of God,
[11:17] mar
[11:20] in the power of the Savior's name. Sons
[11:24] of God, oh sons of God,
[11:28] marior.
[11:36] Son of God,
[11:38] march forward
[11:41] for Jesus ever. Sing hallelujah.
[11:49] March forward.
[11:52] We are more than conquerors in his name.
[11:57] Son of God,
[12:00] march forward
[12:03] in the power of the Savior's
[12:07] name.
[12:10] Amen.
[12:14] Excuse me.
[12:17] Let's just slow it down tonight.
[12:23] And there are two road
[12:28] you may say
[12:32] one by side
[12:35] and one by
[12:39] take the word of God.

[13:03] You will fly
[13:07] to a higher place.
[13:12] Do not struggle.
[13:15] Who lives by grace
[13:20] sets your way
[13:23] to the winds of faith.
[13:28] Wash your feet.
[13:32] Wash your mind.
[13:36] Wash your mouth.
[13:41] I
[13:43] speak the word of God.
[13:47] And by
[13:51] you will move.
[13:54] Oh, you will.
[13:59] to set your way
[14:03] to end the day.
[14:08] You will find
[14:11] to a higher place
[14:16] to the struggle.
[14:20] It's by the way gra

[14:56] already

[16:04] Do those struggle.
[16:10] It's by grace.
[16:14] Set your way
[16:18] to the winds of pain.
[16:23] You guys can have your seats tonight.
[16:25] Um, we have a special from Snomi.
[16:46] I was listening to something and the
[16:48] person I was listening to, he mentioned
[16:50] first things first.
[16:53] and was like, "You need to sing that
[16:54] again." So that happened and then I was
[16:57] having a conversation with somebody a
[16:58] few minutes later and they brought up
[17:00] the same song and they were like, "You
[17:02] should sing that song again." So I
[17:04] thought, "Okay, I guess tonight's the
[17:06] night. Let's sing it again.
[17:21] All the things that I have held, dear,
[17:25] the vanity that whispered in my ear.
[17:30] What would I do if they all disappeared?
[17:38] Riches and fame and all that they could
[17:41] buy. I've come to find they never
[17:44] satisfy.
[17:47] What would I gain if my soul's a price?
[17:53] I don't want to love what the world
[17:55] loves.
[17:57] I don't want to chase what the world
[17:59] does. I only want you.
[18:04] I only want you.
[18:09] First things first, I seek your will,
[18:13] not my own. Surrender all my wants to
[18:18] you
[18:20] and keep the first thing first.
[18:25] To live your truth, to walk your ways,
[18:29] set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you.
[18:36] All my desires reversed
[18:40] to keep the first thing first.
[18:46] I give it all, my life in offering.
[18:50] My heart is yours, so have your way in
[18:54] me.
[18:55] Your kingdom's all I want to see.
[19:01] I don't want to love what the world
[19:04] loves.
[19:05] I don't want to chase what the world
[19:08] does. I only want you.
[19:13] I only want you.
[19:18] First things first, I seek your will,
[19:22] not my own. Surrender all my wants to
[19:26] you.
[19:29] to keep the first thing first.
[19:33] To live your truth, to walk your ways,
[19:38] set my eyes, Lord, I fix my face on you.
[19:45] All my desires reverse
[19:49] to keep the first thing first.
[19:55] Oh,
[19:57] to keep the first thing first.
[20:01] All my desires reversed.
[20:05] To keep the first things first.
[20:11] Oh,
[20:14] first thing first.
[20:19] Oh,
[20:22] first things first. I seek your will,
[20:26] not my own. Surrender all my wants to
[20:31] you
[20:34] to keep the first thing first.
[20:38] To live your truth, walk your ways, set
[20:43] my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you.
[20:50] All my desires reversed
[20:54] to keep the first things first.
[20:59] Oh,
[21:03] first thing first.
[21:06] All my desires reverse
[21:10] to keep the first thing first.
[21:26] God bless you, Naomi. Let's just stand
[21:29] this evening as we sing our last song
[21:31] before Father Ben comes.
[21:42] The blind have sight
[21:46] and death.
[21:50] The lame will walk
[21:54] the lost me.
[21:58] And with you I
[22:01] the dead I raise
[22:05] all through the power
[22:09] in Jesus
[22:11] name.
[22:13] The top five rest
[22:17] and the sick are here.
[22:20] And this mysteries are
[22:24] how God revealed.
[22:28] And now the truth
[22:32] can be proclaimed.

[22:40] in Jesus name.

[23:33] that have been slain.
[23:37] So we're offered freedom
[23:41] in Jesus name.
[23:45] He is the name above our name.

[23:57] open.

[25:57] return.
[26:02] Though the name is giver
[26:06] which we can be saved. Let us find our
[26:11] life and love in Jesus name.
[26:21] Amen.
[26:23] Praise the Lord. Thanks. Thanks brother
[26:25] Josh. Thank you musicians. I mean thanks
[26:27] N for the special. Amen. God bless you
[26:30] all. He is the name above all names.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Every everything must bow to that name.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; It has no other choice.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Uh let's go to the
[26:42] scripture tonight. We're going to go to
[26:45] just a short thought before we have a
[26:47] time of prayer. Um going to go to
[26:50] Revelations 22
[26:52] and we're going to read three verses.
[26:55] Well, four verses here, but just
[26:57] interesting in Revelation. is the last
[26:59] chapter of the uh of the Bible where he
[27:03] where the Lord says, "I come quickly."
[27:06] And I think that's significant.
[27:09] So, we're just going to read here uh
[27:11] Revelations 227, then 12, 13, then 20,
[27:14] and 21.
[27:17] The Lord says here, "Behold, I come
[27:18] quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the
[27:21] sayings of the prophecy of this book."
[27:23] In verse 12, and behold, I come quickly,
[27:25] and my reward is with me to give every
[27:28] man according as his work shall be. I am
[27:30] alpha and omega, the beginning and the
[27:32] end, the first and the last. In verse
[27:34] 20, he which testifith these things
[27:36] saith, surely I come quickly. Amen. Even
[27:39] so, come Lord Jesus. The grace of our
[27:42] Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
[27:45] Amen. So, let's just bow heads in a word
[27:47] of prayer tonight as we approach
[27:49] approach that great lovely one, the Lord
[27:51] Jesus. Amen. Gracious Father, truly
[27:53] Lord, you have the name above all names
[27:55] and you have proven that in this day.
[27:58] Lord, we're so thankful for this, my
[28:00] God, that you have stepped out of
[28:02] history. And once again, Lord, as we bow
[28:04] our heads, we pray. Would you come among
[28:06] us? We invite you here into our
[28:07] presence. May you touch our lives, Lord.
[28:10] Not just those here, those who are
[28:11] streaming. And dear God, we just want to
[28:13] pray. May you move us into a channel of
[28:15] prayer that's no longer us praying, it's
[28:18] you praying through us. That's what we
[28:19] desire. We love you so much. We commit
[28:21] this service into your hands. We ask
[28:23] you'd anoint speaker and hear her one
[28:25] more time for your glory. Cover us cover
[28:27] us all in your blood in Jesus Christ's
[28:29] name. Amen.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats um
[28:33] tonight. And I I I just I just want to
[28:35] ask this question because he says,
[28:37] "Behold, I come quickly." Now, if you
[28:40] take, you know, how it says in Peter,
[28:41] first of second Peter, it says, "One day
[28:43] with God is a thousand years upon the
[28:45] earth." Okay? So if you if you took 70
[28:48] years of earth time and you put it into
[28:52] God's time, it's an hour and 40 minutes.
[28:55] That's 70 years. So God's timing is
[28:57] real. Like we think it it's been 2,000
[28:59] years. But that's that's just two days
[29:02] to him. You know, to him it was just two
[29:04] days ago he was crucified and
[29:06] resurrected. That was just the other
[29:07] day. To him that's what Monday if I
[29:09] could get that, you know, you know,
[29:10] Wednesday and Monday, right? It's just a
[29:11] few days ago. So time is really it's not
[29:14] much of something. But I just want to
[29:17] pose this question. If he says he's
[29:18] going to come quickly and we understand
[29:20] by prophecy that this is the day where
[29:22] he is coming, what would our lives be if
[29:26] we knew he was coming soon? What kind of
[29:29] life would we live? That's why I call
[29:32] this he's coming soon. And how would you
[29:35] be if you knew that?
[29:37] I'm just going to pose this question
[29:40] because we go through a lot of things in
[29:42] life. You know, there's a lot of
[29:43] pressure comes on us and especially in
[29:46] this day where the devils have been
[29:48] released out. You know, there's so much
[29:50] demon power upon the earth. Empty's been
[29:52] um hell has been emptied upon the earth
[29:54] in this day and there's a lot of
[29:56] pressure. There's a lot of battles.
[29:58] There's but you know and you you may be
[30:00] in the worst time of your life you've
[30:02] ever had. But what if you knew he was
[30:04] coming tomorrow for you? Wouldn't that
[30:06] give you a renewed hope? Wouldn't that
[30:08] give you a strength and a courage if you
[30:10] realized he's actually coming soon? You
[30:12] know, he's actually going to going to
[30:14] put an end to all this and he's going to
[30:16] take us where he is. And you know, this
[30:18] is a photo of um uh there's some
[30:21] prisoners of war, allied prisoners of
[30:23] war. They're in Stalag 11b and it's in
[30:26] Germany. And you know, but look at their
[30:28] faces. They've been liberated. 16th of
[30:31] April, 1945, they're being liberated.
[30:33] Now, if you could imagine now as
[30:36] believers, I just want to use this
[30:38] analogy of the prison of war camp in one
[30:40] way that we're trapped in time. Okay?
[30:43] But if you're in Christ, you're free
[30:44] from the devil and all of his works, but
[30:46] you're trapped in time. Okay? So, we're
[30:48] subject to this flesh. The enemy tries
[30:50] to dominate us, all these things. So,
[30:52] I'm not saying we're prisoners to the
[30:54] enemy. Okay? So, I hope I just kind of
[30:55] make that kind of clear, right? We're
[30:57] not. We're free. Okay? But there's a
[30:59] time when you know this the the prison
[31:02] of war camp to me is exactly like this
[31:04] world in the fact that no one wants to
[31:06] be there. People are unhappy if you're
[31:08] confined and you're you're under guard
[31:10] and you don't have you know you know you
[31:12] don't want to be there. You want to go
[31:13] home, right? And there's a yearning
[31:15] within our souls. We want to go be with
[31:17] the Lord. Amen. We want to go. Amen. We
[31:20] don't want to stay here. We we know
[31:22] we're here for a purpose. So we're
[31:23] happy. You know, we're here because God
[31:25] is going to have his will. So we just
[31:27] continue walking on. But really, if we
[31:28] had our way, the rapture would have been
[31:31] a long time ago. We get in, okay, let's
[31:33] go home now, Lord. We're done. You know,
[31:34] but we're here, okay? We're here. But
[31:37] we're we've heard a call. I'm coming
[31:39] soon. Liberation is coming. I mean, when
[31:42] the when the devil is thrown into the
[31:44] lake of fire, and you know, well, before
[31:46] that, we're going to the wedding supper
[31:47] and all those things, but there's a
[31:49] rapture for the church that we're
[31:50] actually in the middle of, that we are
[31:52] living in a great resurrection season.
[31:54] But if this was so real to us, how do
[31:56] you think we would be? Like you look at
[31:57] those men there. They're being
[31:59] liberated. They're happy. They're still
[32:01] behind the gate. But I find it
[32:03] interesting. They control that gate,
[32:05] &gt;&gt; right? But they're happy. They're not
[32:07] down. They're not disheartened. Like
[32:08] their morale is very high. You know,
[32:10] they're very happy. But maybe before
[32:12] this, they would have been discontented.
[32:14] Why are we in this prison of war camp?
[32:16] And I want to go home and when's this
[32:18] all going to be over? We heard that the
[32:19] you know, we we've heard we're winning.
[32:21] When when are we going to when's the
[32:23] victory going to be complete? Right?
[32:25] It's like we know we've won the war
[32:26] because Jesus Christ conquered hell,
[32:28] death, and the grave on Calvary. But
[32:30] when is this whole plan of redemption
[32:31] going to be wound up? When can we go to
[32:33] be with the Lord? Isn't that Isn't that
[32:35] really what we think, right? When when,
[32:37] Lord, we're in 2025 and we're going to
[32:39] go into 2026 and how long are we going
[32:42] to keep walking in this world, Lord?
[32:43] When is the end going to come? And you
[32:46] see, but you see, they finally receive
[32:48] word and then maybe before they even
[32:50] hear that they're going to be liberated,
[32:52] you know, their their guards would have
[32:54] become more agitated, more more
[32:56] stressed, more worried because their
[32:58] because they've heard that their side is
[32:59] losing and you know that, you know, you
[33:01] know, they would have become more
[33:02] agitated and more troubled and maybe a
[33:04] lot shorter tempers and maybe more cruer
[33:07] to their to their prisoners.
[33:09] It's the same thing, you know, the
[33:10] devil, you know, we know in Revelations
[33:11] 12 and 12 that as he is cast down, he
[33:14] has great wrath because he knoweth he
[33:15] has but a short time. And we understand
[33:18] by the message of the hour that when the
[33:19] bride goes up, when we go up, Satan
[33:21] comes down as incarn incarnate as the
[33:23] beast, right? But he knows he's just got
[33:25] a short time. His time is coming and he
[33:28] knows it and he's angry about it, right?
[33:30] So, so the guards, you know, would have
[33:33] been more agitated eventually. Maybe
[33:34] they would have fled. I don't know what
[33:36] would have happened, but you know, their
[33:37] behavior really shows that liberation's
[33:40] coming. And the more the devil kicks
[33:42] against you, fights against you, causes
[33:44] trouble in your life, you're going to
[33:45] realize liberation's coming. The rapture
[33:48] is coming. He's getting more agitated.
[33:50] He's getting more stressed. He's trying
[33:52] to throw every trick in the book at you,
[33:54] trying to get you to quit. Amen. But
[33:56] there's something within you, amen, that
[33:58] you cannot quit. And I tell you what,
[34:00] friends, if you just realize you may be
[34:02] in the worst part of your walk that
[34:04] you've ever going through right now, but
[34:06] if you just realize he's coming soon. I
[34:09] mean, there's going to come an end to
[34:10] the trial. There's going to come an end
[34:12] to the, you know, maybe you just feel so
[34:14] disheartened thinking, what's the point
[34:16] of even trying to serve God? But if you
[34:17] knew he was coming for you, I mean, that
[34:20] would change your entire life, I
[34:21] believe.
[34:23] Amen. And so the enemy is trying to do
[34:24] everything he can to make us quit but
[34:27] and you know trying to make us give up,
[34:29] trying to make us be discouraged and
[34:31] even try and make us ask the question,
[34:33] can we really trust God? I tell you,
[34:36] he's coming for you. He's coming for
[34:38] you. Not to put you into a lake of fire,
[34:40] but to take you to a wedding supper.
[34:43] Amen. That's why he's coming. As the
[34:45] Lord Jesus would say in John 14:1-6,
[34:47] "Let not your hearts be troubled. Ye
[34:49] believe in God, believe also in me. and
[34:51] my father's house are many mansions. If
[34:53] were not so, I would have told you, I go
[34:56] to prepare a place for you. And if I go
[34:58] and prepare a place for you, I will come
[35:00] again and receive you unto myself, that
[35:02] where I am, there ye may be also. And
[35:05] whether I go, you know, and the way you
[35:07] know. And Thomas saith unto him, Lord,
[35:09] we know not whether thou goest, and how
[35:11] can we know the way? Jesus saith unto
[35:13] him, I am the way, the truth, and the
[35:15] life. No man cometh unto the Father but
[35:17] by me. He's prepared a place for us.
[35:21] Amen.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; And he's come again to receive us unto
[35:26] himself. That's what this message does
[35:28] is actually Christ receiving his bride
[35:30] to himself. Amen. That he says where I
[35:32] am there you will be also. It's not
[35:34] where we are in this in this realm.
[35:36] Amen. But in but in the heaven of
[35:38] heavens. Amen. But what has he done?
[35:40] He's reached he's he sent his word upon
[35:42] the earth. And we understand that he is
[35:44] his word. So where his word is is it's
[35:47] exactly the same as him physically being
[35:50] there. Maybe you're sick, you know, like
[35:52] the centurion. The centurion, you know,
[35:54] Jesus was going to come and lay hands on
[35:56] his servant and, you know, pray for him
[35:57] that he'll be well. But the centurion
[35:59] said, "Lord, I'm not worthy that you
[36:01] come under my roof. Just speak the word
[36:03] only and my servant will be well." And
[36:05] he had a revelation that all Jesus need
[36:07] to do was speak the word. And it was
[36:09] exactly the same as him physically going
[36:11] into his house, touching the servant,
[36:14] praying for him. It was exactly the same
[36:15] thing. And that's gentile faith. Amen.
[36:17] So where God's word is, he is present
[36:20] cuz he is his word. Amen. So he's come,
[36:23] I mean, to receive us unto himself. And
[36:26] he said, and and the reason we're being
[36:28] received is because we have a mansion
[36:30] waiting over yonder. Maybe about this
[36:32] tall, maybe a bit taller, depending on
[36:35] your stature of your eternal body,
[36:36] right? But you've got a mansion. Amen.
[36:38] You've got a theophony. You've got a
[36:40] eventually a glorified body. You you've
[36:42] got it waiting for you already. And and
[36:45] the reason you have it, I mean I mean
[36:47] the reason you're received is because
[36:48] you have that. What if you knew that
[36:51] today is the day? Well, the Bible says
[36:54] no man knoweth the day or the hour. That
[36:57] is true. But Jesus said the seasons that
[37:00] this would happen. He said as in the
[37:02] days of Lot, which is the days of Sodom
[37:04] and Gomorrah, so shall the coming of the
[37:06] son of man be. In the days of Noah, you
[37:08] know, population increase. there's you
[37:10] know sexual uh you know there's marriage
[37:12] remarage there's violence all these
[37:13] things going on in the days of Noah all
[37:15] those things happening these things have
[37:17] been repeated in this day he said it
[37:19] would be like you know there'll be the
[37:21] servants and that like a like a lord or
[37:23] a master goes away and tells his
[37:25] servants to occupy and gives them
[37:26] talents and these things and you know
[37:28] there's you know one that would bury
[37:30] their talent and there'd be you know
[37:31] different parable where where where one
[37:34] of the servants says the lord delays his
[37:36] coming gets drunk with the world and
[37:38] begins to smite his fellow servant
[37:39] servants and then in a time that that
[37:41] servant thought not, the king comes back
[37:42] and deals with that servant. And it's
[37:44] the same thing. People have said there's
[37:45] a delay. He's not coming. The
[37:48] expectation seems to be diminishing
[37:49] because time is going on. But to the
[37:52] bride of Jesus Christ, I believe that
[37:54] expectation is greater. Amen. On a
[37:56] personal level, it's far greater now
[37:58] than ever has been. And now since you
[38:00] begin to walk with God, I believe I pray
[38:02] that it means more to you to think, I'm
[38:05] going home soon.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; He's coming. The dead in Christ are
[38:08] going to raise and we're going to know
[38:11] them. There's going to be seven church
[38:12] ages raised and we're going to have
[38:14] fellowship with them all for about 40
[38:16] days. Our bodies are going to be changed
[38:18] and we're going to meet all the martyrs.
[38:20] We're going to meet Paul. We're going to
[38:21] meet all the believers down through the
[38:22] ages. We're going to meet those who've
[38:23] gone on before us. Amen. And then our
[38:26] bodies going to be changed. We're going
[38:27] to be caught up together to meet the
[38:28] Lord in the air. We're living in that
[38:30] season.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; We're living in that season. And you
[38:32] say, "Well, people have preached for,
[38:34] you know, people have been under that
[38:35] expectation for 2,000 years." Yes, they
[38:38] have. Amen. But we are the generation
[38:40] which are alive and remain. Amen. That
[38:42] will, Amen. not taste death.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God's going to change these
[38:46] bodies.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[38:49] &gt;&gt; He's coming for you.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's coming for you. He's on your
[38:53] trail. And it's not to drag you to
[38:55] judgment. No, he took your judgment on
[38:56] Calvary. He's here to change your body.
[38:58] Amen. He's he But he's coming for you.
[39:00] And we got to realize we're not here
[39:02] just to, you know, you know, we there
[39:05] will come an end. There will come an
[39:08] end. What if you knew that it was going
[39:10] to happen tomorrow in terms of all the
[39:12] burdens you carry and the struggles and
[39:14] the mind battles? I think all those
[39:16] things really wouldn't matter
[39:18] &gt;&gt; because the Lord is going to change you
[39:20] because remember our souls are redeemed.
[39:22] If you really know Christ, your soul has
[39:24] been redeemed. Your body's just got to
[39:26] catch up to your soul. So what's
[39:28] happened in your soul is going to come
[39:30] into your spirit and change your human
[39:32] spirit and change your body. Until that
[39:34] moment, we still have the same human
[39:36] spirit, same human body. So you're
[39:38] subject to mind battles, complexes,
[39:40] whatever, all those things. But none of
[39:42] those things change your eternal
[39:44] destination if you're sealed to the day
[39:45] of your redemption by the Holy Ghost.
[39:47] None of those things change your
[39:48] salvation.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; So why don't we put them So why don't we
[39:52] take that mountain and make it just a
[39:54] molehill? It's really not that big. If
[39:57] you really realize, you know, if just
[39:58] say literally, we never saw Christmas,
[40:01] but tomorrow we're all gone. You, you
[40:04] know, I think sometimes we think, why
[40:06] did we worry so much?
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Why do we let those enemies, let those
[40:10] problems and those things that, why did
[40:12] we let it occupy our mind so much?
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's coming for us.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And he'd say in
[40:21] questions answers uh 64 he say and
[40:23] remember Isaac left the tent and was
[40:25] standing out in the field meditating in
[40:27] the late afternoon. Amen. When he saw
[40:29] Rebecca coming and he had never saw him
[40:31] and he never saw her and it was love at
[40:33] the first sight. She fell in love with
[40:35] him and he with her and she was even
[40:37] veiled. Amen. Oh my. And look when she
[40:40] seen him her heart was so full of joy.
[40:42] She didn't know who she she was going to
[40:44] marry but by faith. Amen. And remember,
[40:46] Jesus will leave the kingdom and we'll
[40:48] not meet him in glory. We'll meet him in
[40:50] the air between heavens and the earth
[40:52] where it's expanded to redeem us. And he
[40:54] met Rebecca in the middle between her
[40:56] home and his home. So heaven has
[40:59] expanded. Amen. To meet us that we'll
[41:01] meet him in the air. He's coming for us.
[41:04] We're living in the season. Amen. We are
[41:06] not waiting for, you know, it's not I
[41:09] don't believe it won't it won't be 100
[41:12] years. Well, what if it is? I'm going to
[41:14] look him for him every day. Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; But what if it is tomorrow?
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But then all the cares
[41:20] of life really don't matter.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Uh you know, if you're sealed, if you
[41:23] know the Lord and the power of his his
[41:25] resurrection, if you really have the
[41:26] Holy Ghost, what matters? I'm going.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; If you don't know him, I encourage you
[41:32] make sure you know him.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; He's He's worth meeting more than
[41:36] anything.
[41:38] Amen. I'll be see we should we should
[41:40] always stand in that with that idea that
[41:43] we should be prepared
[41:45] at all times cuz he could come. That's
[41:49] glorious. Brother would be told you're
[41:51] scaring the people saying things like
[41:52] that. He says no it's the most glorious
[41:54] thing to the believer. I'm going to see
[41:55] my Lord.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to see the one who purchased
[41:58] my salvation. I'm going to see my
[41:59] redeemer, my husband, my lover, my king,
[42:02] my all in all. It's going to be a
[42:03] wonderful meeting. Amen.
[42:06] Praise the Lord. Now wait. How do you
[42:08] know? How do you know he's he's coming
[42:10] for you? Well, I'm glad I asked the
[42:12] question on your behalf. Okay, cuz it's
[42:14] a good question because this is more
[42:15] than just pie in the sky. This is more
[42:17] than a pipe dream or whatever. Just a
[42:20] nice idea. This is a reality cuz God has
[42:23] sent evidence after evidence, sign after
[42:26] sign that he's coming for you and I.
[42:29] Amen. Even even the you know we would we
[42:31] would receive the uh seal of God the
[42:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Bible
[42:36] says that this is the earnest or the
[42:38] down payment of our salvation. So if you
[42:40] have met the Lord he's basically telling
[42:42] you I'm coming for you. Amen. If he's
[42:44] given you a heart to receive his word
[42:46] he's basically telling you I'm coming
[42:48] for you. I mean 1100 odd messages 66
[42:51] books in the Bible. What is he telling
[42:52] you? I'm coming for you. Amen. I'm
[42:54] coming to carry you away. That's the
[42:56] whole purpose of my, you know, the
[42:58] ambition of my existence is to redeem a
[43:00] people back to myself. Amen. So, even if
[43:03] you've been healed, you know, healing,
[43:04] divine healing is just a small taste of
[43:07] what the of what the change in the body
[43:09] will be. Amen. You look at, you know,
[43:11] you know, with healing or there's
[43:13] sickness in your body, there's some
[43:14] maybe damaged cells or a sickness
[43:17] running through your body. What does God
[43:19] do? He changes that disease and he makes
[43:21] the body new like he did with Lazarus.
[43:23] You know, I know it's an extreme case,
[43:25] but he was four days in the grave. He
[43:27] was already rotting and decaying. But
[43:29] but Jesus said, "I am the resurrection
[43:31] and the life and he called Lazarus forth
[43:33] by name." And if he didn't call him by
[43:35] name, there would have been a general
[43:36] resurrection. And what happened? But
[43:38] that, you know, Lazarus did not come
[43:39] back to life in a decaying body or even
[43:42] a sick body. He came back in a healthy,
[43:44] strong, and well body. But Jesus was
[43:46] saying, "I am the resurrection." And he
[43:48] proved it. And he was showing Lazarus,
[43:51] Lazarus, I'm coming for you. Mary and
[43:52] Martha, I'm coming for you and I'm going
[43:54] to show you cuz I'm going to do a
[43:56] miracle in your life to prove I'm the
[43:58] resurrection. Now, it's the same thing
[43:59] with sickness. It's just a it's just an
[44:01] am you, you know, a small down payment
[44:03] of the fact that God can heal us. But
[44:06] then he that's but the biggest divine
[44:08] healing that's ever going to happen in
[44:10] the history of the world is when these
[44:12] bodies become eternal.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's going to be one great
[44:16] sweep. Amen. And it's going to be God
[44:18] and his sovereignty going to change this
[44:20] mortal to immortality. Amen. But if
[44:23] God's ever healed you, what is he
[44:24] telling you? I'm coming for you. Amen.
[44:26] That's why I've healed you. Cuz I want
[44:28] you to know, Amen. that you're not just
[44:30] going to have a little bit of a healing
[44:31] of a maybe an organ or something that's
[44:34] damaged that be whole or a back or
[44:36] whatever it is. I'm going to do more
[44:37] than that. I'm going to change your
[44:38] complete body that you can never get
[44:40] sick again. Amen. I'm going to make my
[44:43] make your body like the condition of
[44:45] your soul is. Praise the Lord. Amen. So,
[44:48] there's going to be one great Amen. one
[44:50] great move of divine healing which will
[44:53] be the change of our body. But I tell
[44:54] you, if he's ever healed you or or or
[44:57] you know, you know someone who's been
[44:58] healed, God is telling you, I'm coming
[45:00] for you.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even even for the even for the um
[45:05] if I can find it here. Even for the
[45:08] fact, you know, we were we were once
[45:09] dead in trespasses and sins, we were
[45:12] dead. Amen. Whether you like it or not,
[45:14] you're born in a dead spiritual
[45:16] condition. But what did God do? He
[45:18] brought a resurrection. He brought life.
[45:20] I mean, once we're dead in trespasses
[45:22] and sins. Amen. But he but but he has
[45:24] quickened us. Which means make us alive.
[45:27] Amen. If you've been made alive in
[45:29] Christ, he's basically he's telling you,
[45:30] I'm coming for you. Amen. I'm proven.
[45:33] I've done this in your soul. I'm going
[45:34] to do it for you in complete being.
[45:37] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, I think we
[45:40] can rejoice.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. this, you know, tonight we can
[45:42] realize he's coming for me. I mean, he's
[45:44] already got a hold of my soul and he's
[45:46] not going to do one-third of a job. He's
[45:48] going to do a complete job of soul,
[45:51] spirit, and body.
[45:53] Praise the Lord. Well, how else do I
[45:56] know that he's he he's alive and he's
[45:58] coming for me? Brother Brown would speak
[46:00] about that unseen realm. It's very
[46:03] mysterious really, if you think about
[46:04] it. I've well I I can't really say. I've
[46:08] seen a vision. I've seen some things,
[46:11] but you know, I you know, it's not like
[46:12] I you know, I can stand here like the
[46:14] prophet of God and say, "Now there's a
[46:15] pillar of fire there and here he is and
[46:17] seeing visions and all those things."
[46:19] I'm not built that way. Okay? But the
[46:22] thing is and and so he says he says um
[46:25] here
[46:27] he's speaking about healing and
[46:28] different things. He says, "Now remember
[46:29] he's uh what he's already done he cannot
[46:31] do again." And what is that? He's
[46:33] purchased our healing and our salvation
[46:34] in its completeness. See, he put it in
[46:37] completely from his reach. Now he's put
[46:38] it in your reach. He's done all he can
[46:40] do. Is that right, Minister? See, there
[46:42] isn't a thing he can do about it. It's
[46:44] out of his reach. It's in your reach.
[46:46] For he was wounded for our
[46:47] transgressions. With his stripes, we
[46:49] were healed. See? See? It's out of his
[46:51] reach. But it's But he's brought it to
[46:54] your reach. It's in your reach now. It
[46:55] was put there for you. He just point to
[46:58] where it was. Say, "Well, if uh it's
[47:00] always been a puzzle to me. Really, the
[47:02] truth is, does he still live?" Or I
[47:04] could put you I could change it. But is
[47:06] he really coming to get me? Okay.
[47:08] Certainly he lives. That's this you're
[47:11] bumping into all the time. What are you
[47:14] bumping into? It's actually you're
[47:15] bumping into him.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You feel condemned. You feel
[47:19] blessed. God begins to inspire you. He
[47:21] begins to direct your thoughts, counsel
[47:23] you. You know, he begins to deal with
[47:26] your life. That's actually heaven
[47:27] bumping into you. Amen. It's like you
[47:30] can't see him, but he can see you.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's actually because remember
[47:34] that dimension is just here.
[47:37] Heaven isn't a million miles away. It's
[47:39] just running at a faster speed just
[47:41] above us here. It's right here. And the
[47:43] Lord reaches in, touches your life,
[47:46] condemn you, convicts you, tells you to
[47:48] make things right, blesses you, gives
[47:50] you inspiration, gives you strength,
[47:52] anoints the word. I mean, anoints a song
[47:54] to you. What's that? You're bumping into
[47:56] him. Or he's actually bumping into you.
[47:59] And he always does it very deliberately.
[48:01] He doesn't do it haphazardly. Oh, sorry.
[48:03] Sorry. That was an accident. No, he does
[48:05] it very deliberately. Amen. But what is
[48:07] that now? He's actually telling you,
[48:09] "I'm coming for you." Amen. You feel the
[48:11] anointing flow and you just feel so
[48:13] blessed in his presence. He's basically
[48:15] telling you, I'm going to repeat this.
[48:17] I'm coming for you.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And soon it's not going to just be
[48:20] a bump and a bump. It's just going to be
[48:22] a permanent contact and you're going to
[48:24] be gone.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. See what's that
[48:30] makes you believe? That's him.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may not be able to open your
[48:35] eyes and see him because he's in spirit
[48:37] form, the invisible God, but he dwells
[48:39] among a visible people, making himself
[48:41] visible by his promised word in that
[48:43] people. Do you understand that now?
[48:46] Praise the Lord.
[48:48] I'm so glad for that.
[48:50] Amen. So maybe let's just I'm just going
[48:54] to wind this down here very just with
[48:56] this question again.
[48:59] What would life be like? Because we know
[49:02] one day it's going to happen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; But what if that promise became a lot
[49:06] more real,
[49:08] a lot more personal?
[49:11] That this message came to give you
[49:13] rapturing faith. Brother Ram says, "If
[49:15] you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[49:16] you're ready for the rapture
[49:18] &gt;&gt; because the rapture is within you."
[49:21] So what if what if you're like these
[49:22] soldiers here
[49:25] where you hear he's helpers coming,
[49:29] liberation's coming and then our
[49:31] liberation's here.
[49:33] What would that do to you? I tell you
[49:36] what, this message has come to tell you
[49:38] liberation is here. You're living in the
[49:41] season of the change of the change of
[49:43] the by the dead in Christ raising. I
[49:45] pray this is very real to us all
[49:47] &gt;&gt; as we go into this holiday season. I
[49:51] might speak about on Sunday, but I'm
[49:52] thinking about what's the effects of
[49:53] God's wrap gift.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; What has it done? What is it doing? It's
[49:58] doing great things. Transforming power,
[50:02] healing, liberation, redemption.
[50:06] All's it for cuz he's telling you, I'm
[50:08] coming for you. And it's not to condemn
[50:11] you. It's not to throw you aside. It's
[50:13] not to leave you empty. It's that he's
[50:16] going to carry you from this world to
[50:18] the next world. We're going to be gone.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; So, while we're going through this life,
[50:25] let's just rejoice.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; He's coming. This is not the end.
[50:29] Whatever you're going through, it's not
[50:31] the end. God's the answer to all things.
[50:34] We can trust him.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; He's coming for you. And soon we'll be
[50:38] gone. Amen. Can we have the musicians,
[50:40] please? Tonight I just wanted to speak
[50:43] briefly on those things. But I just pray
[50:44] you know this this is
[50:48] right there.
[50:51] We're right there.
[50:58] Amen. Let's um
[51:03] let's stand, shall we?
[51:05] Can we sing that song? Uh he's a miracle
[51:07] working God.
[51:13] But just any day know now my Lord is
[51:16] coming.
[51:18] I trust you're watching and waiting. You
[51:20] say I'm afraid. You don't have to be
[51:22] afraid.
[51:24] You don't need to fear. There should be
[51:26] such a joy. Thank you, Lord. You
[51:29] purchased my salvation. You've changed
[51:30] my life. I encourage you if you if this
[51:33] is idle tales to you, ask the Lord to
[51:35] change it to be a reality.
[51:38] You'll see him do it. Amen. So, let's
[51:40] just sing this. Then we're going to go
[51:41] through the prayer request and have a
[51:42] time of prayer. Amen.
