[6:33] but it's quite a neat word
[6:36] vundabar
[6:39] wonderful someone asked me yesterday how
[6:41] I was they came in to work and they said
[6:43] how are you I said I'm fantastic I'm
[6:45] about 12 out of 10 they will sort of
[6:47] take him back cuz most people go yeah
[6:48] good you know 12 out of 10 man I'm
[6:51] awesome you know it's it's hey we're
[6:55] we're always 12 or 13 out of 10 you know
[6:57] that's where we hover
[7:00] um are you warm you know we spend so
[7:03] much of our I don't know if you think
[7:04] about it we spend a lot of our can you
[7:05] just turn the piano down a we bit we
[7:07] spend a lot of our um effort to stay
[7:10] keep our body warm you notice that we
[7:12] like to hover around 20 22° or something
[7:16] so you know when it's when it's cold we
[7:18] get heaters we do all this stuff to have
[7:20] our body warm otherwise if our body gets
[7:22] cold we it's not a very enjoyable
[7:24] experience and for a prolonged period of
[7:26] time it could be quite a fatal
[7:27] experience not being warm
[7:31] but our soul is the same you know you
[7:34] you've heard the saying about a
[7:35] cold-hearted person you know they they
[7:37] they but the spirit of God is warm it's
[7:39] I think it's a warm Spirit you know it's
[7:41] always related as as a fire you know and
[7:43] and the spirit of God warms our heart it
[7:45] warms our our soul and and our soul gets
[7:47] nice and warm and comfortable and we you
[7:49] know when you're warm you're like you're
[7:50] happy you can relax when you're cold
[7:51] you're not happy but but I'm glad that
[7:55] you know we're not cold-hearted people
[7:57] we're warm we're warm people when when
[7:59] when they would have the prayer line you
[8:01] know someone would come up and brother
[8:03] Brandon would say I can I can sense
[8:04] you're a Christian I feel a warm Spirit
[8:06] about you you know had notice that warm
[8:08] spirit and and that's what we want to
[8:10] bathe in this morning is the warmth of
[8:12] the Holy Ghost we want that warm Spirit
[8:13] to be in our heart and just to surround
[8:15] us and to to get us in a get us in a
[8:18] nice climate that we that we enjoy and
[8:19] we and that the word of God could come
[8:21] so so praise the Lord let's um let's
[8:23] stand this morning and pray that the
[8:25] warmth of the Holy Ghost would just come
[8:27] and move in our midst this morning
[8:30] Lord we thank you Lord that in this Lord
[8:33] what seems to be such a cold world Lord
[8:36] where so many hearts are cold Lord and
[8:38] they and they turn so brittle When
[8:41] Things become cold they go so brittle
[8:43] Lord like a a out out in the the frost
[8:46] here this morning Lord if it was a even
[8:48] a leaf Lord if it gets too cold it it
[8:50] may be pliable when it's warm but it
[8:52] could just snap with the cold Lord such
[8:55] a such an example of Lord how how when a
[8:58] man are a woman's heart gets so cold
[9:01] Lord and away from you they become so
[9:02] brittle and can break so
[9:04] easily Lord and not the way that we're
[9:06] supposed to be we're supposed to be in
[9:08] warmth Lord and pliable and flexible
[9:10] Lord and just when in the warmth of the
[9:12] Holy Ghost Lord so we just pray that the
[9:14] spirit of God would warm each heart and
[9:16] soul here this morning Lord we've we've
[9:19] done all these natural things to get our
[9:21] our natural body warm Lord but it's it's
[9:23] it's our spiritual soul lord we would'
[9:25] be better in a freezing place with the
[9:27] warmth of the Holy Ghost in our heart
[9:28] Lord than in a warm building and and a
[9:30] and a Cold Heart Lord so we just pray
[9:33] Lord that you just warm each heart this
[9:34] morning I believe we already are and

[9:37] may you bless us with your spirit and
[9:39] bless us with your word Lord may we

[26:22] Lazarus rise
[26:24] up rise up
[26:28] I from the C like
[26:41] [Music]
[26:46] [Applause]
[27:05] amen I always like when the band does a
[27:08] song because um
[27:10] they the these the musicians here are
[27:13] quite good they they they put effort in
[27:15] they practice they when you're a
[27:18] musician you notice it you know you
[27:19] notice when there's supposed to be a
[27:20] little stop there's a little stop then
[27:21] the drama go does a little start again
[27:23] and it all kind of works but you know
[27:25] I've got this theory that anything you
[27:26] do you should do it well
[27:29] and then anything you do for the Lord
[27:30] you should do it very well you know put
[27:32] effort in you don't have to be the best
[27:34] but you just have to give your best you
[27:35] know and um we were going to do we've
[27:38] got a song you know we sort of seem to
[27:40] write a song each year for the camp we
[27:41] were going to do that today but um Tiana
[27:44] is away and she plays the piano for that
[27:46] one so we'll do that next weekend so
[27:48] we'll teach it to you next weekend
[27:50] okay yeah just to give you a little bit
[27:53] of
[27:56] suspense um your anticipation uh let's
[28:00] um stand this morning we're going to
[28:01] just sing you um just a few songs this
[28:03] morning the the
[28:08] um I just want to bring the chus up in
[28:10] here I'm fighting a battle you've
[28:12] already won no matter what comes my way
[28:14] I will overcome and this one here just
[28:17] so cuz the the wording could seem wrong
[28:19] but it's actually if you if you see it
[28:22] in the right context it's correct
[28:23] because it says I don't know what you're
[28:25] doing but I know what you've done
[28:28] an example for that would be like I'm
[28:30] fighting a battle you've already won an
[28:32] example
[28:33] to know that that's not spoken on
[28:35] unbelief it's more like when the
[28:37] children of Israel when God delivered
[28:38] them from Egypt they would deliver with
[28:41] a mighty hand and then they ended up at
[28:43] at at the Red Sea where it seemed like
[28:44] they were they were there was an ocean
[28:47] on this side there was a big uh hell on
[28:49] massive cliff on that side a cliff on
[28:51] that side and the only way out was the
[28:52] way they came in and that was where the
[28:54] Egyptians were coming through so they
[28:56] essentially had no way out and and they
[28:59] were they were done for if they just
[29:00] looked at their situation but they could
[29:02] have said but they could have but been
[29:04] in faith they could have said Lord I
[29:06] don't know what you're
[29:07] doing but I know what you've done I know
[29:10] you're delivering me there I don't know
[29:11] what's going on here but I'm fighting a
[29:13] battle you've already
[29:14] won and sometimes we get that in our
[29:17] life we we don't know what's going on
[29:18] but you know we have to have enough
[29:19] confidence Lord I don't understand any
[29:21] of this it seems like it's all just
[29:23] going to come apart and I'm going to be
[29:24] defeated and everything's just going to
[29:25] go wrong but I know what you've done
[29:28] delivered me from everything else you're
[29:29] going to deliver me from this one I
[29:31] don't know what you're doing but I know
[29:32] what you've done I'm fighting a battle
[29:34] you've already won
[29:40] amen there's a peace that out lost
[29:45] Darkness hope that's in the
[29:49] blood this future Grace that's mine

[40:38] Esther and typical my slides
[40:43] change in order amen we want to we want
[40:46] to read here Esther uh 3 and
[40:49] one and then we're going to go to uh the
[40:51] book of Isaiah amen so
[40:55] amen well I hope everyone W thought
[40:58] out amen I can't feel my toes but it's
[41:01] all right I'm sure I'll get feeling
[41:04] eventually amen but praise the Lord I'm
[41:06] glad it's warm spiritually in here amen
[41:08] that's the main thing amen we're not a
[41:11] bunch of icicles spiritually amen so
[41:13] praise a lot so Esther 3 and one so
[41:15] after these things we know those things
[41:17] was Esther becoming Queen did King of
[41:20] hazus promote hmon the son of hameda the
[41:24] agagite and advanced him and set his
[41:26] seat above all the princes that were
[41:28] with him and all the king's servants
[41:30] that were in the king's gate bowed and
[41:31] reverence hmon for the king had so
[41:33] commanded concerning him but morai bowed
[41:36] not nor did him reverence then the
[41:38] king's servants which are in the king's
[41:40] gate said unto Mori why trans
[41:42] transgresses thou the king's commandment
[41:45] now it came to pass that when uh they
[41:47] spake daily unto him and he hearkened
[41:49] not unto them that they told hmon to see
[41:52] where the mori's matters would stand for
[41:54] he told them that he was a Jew and and
[41:57] when hmon saw that Mori bowed not nor
[42:00] did him reverence then hmon was full of
[42:04] Wrath amen then we're going to go to uh
[42:06] the book of Isaiah we're going to go to
[42:08] chapter
[42:09] 14 and familiar pieces of scripture I
[42:13] know but I we just want to go over a few
[42:16] few of these things again today so
[42:17] Isaiah 14
[42:20] and12 you know it's amazing how God I
[42:22] love it how God prophesies our end
[42:25] prophesies the devil's end too amen he
[42:27] ties up all things there's no loose uh
[42:29] Loose Ends amen but how art thou fallen
[42:32] from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[42:33] morning how art thou cut down to the
[42:35] ground which did US weaken the Nations
[42:38] for thou has said in thine heart I'll
[42:39] Ascend into heaven I'll exalt my throne
[42:41] above the stars of God I will sit also
[42:44] upon the Mount of the congregation and
[42:45] the sides of the north I will Ascend
[42:47] above the heights of the clouds I will
[42:49] be like the most high yet Thou shalt be
[42:52] brought down to Hell to the sides of the
[42:55] pit they that see thee shall nrow look
[42:57] upon thee and consider thee saying is
[43:00] this the man that made the Earth to
[43:02] tremble that did Shake kingdoms that
[43:04] made the world as a Wilderness and
[43:06] destroyed cities thereof and open not
[43:08] the house of his prisoners amen let's
[43:11] bow our heads in a word of prayer this
[43:12] morning amen let's pray together
[43:15] gracious father we thank you so much
[43:16] that we can come into your presence this
[43:18] morning as a people Lord not by anything
[43:20] we have achieved or done but by Your
[43:22] Precious Blood Lord we thank you for
[43:24] your all sufficient sacrifice which has
[43:26] made a way pray for us so dear God we
[43:28] want to Bow our hearts with reverence
[43:30] and Thanksgiving Lord as we approach you
[43:32] just asking dear God that once again you
[43:34] come and take over the service Lord may
[43:37] you rule in all of our hearts and Minds
[43:39] today dear God may you anoint your word
[43:41] to speaker and hearer and may you
[43:43] receive all honor glory and praise today
[43:45] Father we just want to commit the day
[43:46] into your hands we thank you for all
[43:48] that's taking place today may you just
[43:50] Lord be glorified everything said and
[43:52] done father be with those who couldn't
[43:53] make it today I pray You' be with them
[43:55] Father wherever they are Lord their sick
[43:57] and body or traveling where wherever
[43:59] they may be be their portion Lord we
[44:01] love you and we thank you Lord in Jesus
[44:03] Christ's name amen amen amen God bless
[44:06] you friends you can have your seats this
[44:07] morning really appreciate the song
[44:09] service I believe it kind of just tied
[44:10] in really nicely to where we're going
[44:12] today but we see this here where um I
[44:15] just want to just point this out now I
[44:17] just if I had a title today I'd say uh
[44:21] Satan knows who he is God knows who he
[44:23] is but do you know who you are amen so
[44:25] it's very important we know who we are
[44:27] amen that because our um our identity
[44:30] gives us power gives us Authority now as
[44:32] we read here in Isaiah how how Lucifer
[44:35] had this grand grand scheme in his heart
[44:38] he says he'll he'll become like the most
[44:40] high he's going to exalt himself be
[44:41] worshiped as God be exalt himself above
[44:44] the sons of God but then the Lord would
[44:47] prophesy his end saying you're going to
[44:49] be brought down to the sides of the pit
[44:52] now it's interesting it says they shall
[44:55] they that see thee shall narrowly look
[44:56] upon the and consider thee so it's not
[44:58] saying all people will see him but it's
[45:01] they that see thee now it's so important
[45:03] that we that we see the devil for who he
[45:06] is amen because we know he's the God of
[45:09] this evil age and you know by deception
[45:11] and deceit he's coming and he's doing
[45:13] what he's doing but if we could really
[45:15] see him for what he is and consider him
[45:18] then we would have the same kind of we
[45:20] would be living out the scripture is
[45:21] this the man is this really this being
[45:24] that's exalted himself and proclaimed
[45:26] himself to be so great but yet he's
[45:28] fallen he's destroyed he's come to
[45:30] nothing now I believe that that that
[45:32] this scene that we see here is not just
[45:34] going to be before he's thrown to the
[45:36] great uh Lake of Fire but there's a
[45:38] people upon the Earth that have the
[45:40] revelation of who the devil is because
[45:43] they have the revelation of who God is
[45:44] and who they are in Christ am mean that
[45:46] they can actually look upon the enemy in
[45:48] all of his tricks all of his plans all
[45:50] of his schemes and consider him saying
[45:52] is this really this enemy that is that
[45:54] has caused such wreckage and destruction
[45:56] and you know come am uh among people and
[45:59] they can see him for what he is now this
[46:02] is the age where people can stand and
[46:04] see him for what he is brother R said
[46:06] when the seals come open it exposes
[46:08] Satan doesn't just reveal Christ because
[46:10] brother R says the opening of the seals
[46:12] reveals Christ right but it reveals who
[46:14] Satan is as well I mean so we we are not
[46:17] standing in this day with a book that's
[46:19] closed and we're wondering how powerful
[46:21] our enemy is his schemes are we know his
[46:23] schemes we know his agenda we know his
[46:25] plans amen and we know his plans for you
[46:27] and I just like he had plans for morai
[46:30] and for Esther hymon now I'm speaking
[46:31] just going to use it as a type but you
[46:33] see we we can stand here and we can see
[46:36] him for what he is now I pray that God
[46:38] would turn the light on Hallelujah
[46:40] because the devil loves to hide in
[46:42] secret he loves to hide in the what
[46:44] could be he loves to hide in the shadows
[46:46] he loves to hide in fear and the
[46:48] possibilities and you know he but but
[46:49] when the lights turn on it's like when
[46:52] you when you hear something and it's
[46:53] dark you don't know what it is if you
[46:55] know what that sound is you're not
[46:56] afraid
[46:57] but if you hear an uncertain sound you
[46:59] never heard it before Oh what could that
[47:00] be going on in the house but if you know
[47:02] it is you're not afraid you know
[47:04] sometimes when we'd move house i' say
[47:06] the girls you'd hear a a a a water pipe
[47:09] or S I'd say this is this that's the
[47:10] wind in the trees here this is this
[47:12] sound just try and calm them down saying
[47:13] you don't need to be worried about the
[47:15] sounds at night cuz this is what they
[47:17] are amen so it's the same thing with the
[47:19] devil he he loves to work in Shadow but
[47:22] when the lights turn on he's like
[47:24] cockroaches when the lights turn on or
[47:25] rats or mice they scatter as fast as
[47:27] they can because they get uncomfortable
[47:29] in the presence of light amen and when
[47:32] the light of the Gospel shine upon the
[47:34] Devil in his tricks amen he gets very
[47:36] uncomfortable and we want want him to be
[47:38] uncomfortable we want you to be super
[47:40] comfortable we want him to be very
[47:42] uncomfortable amen so I pray the light
[47:44] would just turn on because when the
[47:46] light turns on of the word we recognize
[47:49] who we are amen and when we recognize
[47:52] who we are we recognize we're not down
[47:54] beaten downtrodden slay no hopers no
[47:58] future no nothing we're not those kind
[48:00] of a people amen but our future is
[48:02] secure our future is good our future is
[48:05] dancing on streets of gold amen and then
[48:08] then also we recognize that we have
[48:10] dominion over every Power of Hell amen
[48:13] by the blood of Jesus Christ so the
[48:15] revelation of the word the the blood
[48:18] released it the Revelation gives it
[48:21] that's why we must pray for Revelation
[48:22] don't be caught up in the what could
[48:23] bees of life we're got to we're got to
[48:25] discern because many times we think it's
[48:27] just our own mind ruling us causing us
[48:32] trouble making us
[48:33] upset but that's not the case at all
[48:36] amen many times you see I'll just I'll
[48:38] just read this just I just lay a bit of
[48:40] a thing here oh here see see brother Ram
[48:44] says that now in a meeting group going
[48:45] on an evil spirit in the meeting that
[48:47] spirit is almost harmless until it can
[48:50] catch somebody that it can work through
[48:52] yeah so the Devil Himself is almost
[48:54] harmless until someone can open
[48:57] themselves up for him to work through if
[48:59] everyone is closed off see see if you
[49:00] want to kill the devil out of your life
[49:02] you kill his influence if you want to
[49:05] slay the devil kill his influence out of
[49:07] your life or let the word of God kill
[49:10] his influence you see if you're always
[49:12] double minded you're wondering you know
[49:14] which way to go if the word is right or
[49:15] the word is wrong that's the devil
[49:17] trying to influence you to step off the
[49:20] path so he's trying to rule your life
[49:22] well how do you kill that influence you
[49:23] say God Reveal Your word to me amen show
[49:26] yourself alive Lord I want Lord I've
[49:29] heard your alive but I want to see you
[49:30] live Lord your word has been proven and
[49:33] just go start listening to testimonies
[49:34] if you got nothing else and you'll be
[49:36] going to see God proved his word back
[49:37] there he's the same yesterday today and
[49:39] forever amen expose yourself listen to
[49:42] the message of the hour Jesus Christ
[49:43] comes to the present time amen and you
[49:46] will see the light turns on see because
[49:49] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[49:50] word of God and with faith takes its
[49:53] position unbelief has to go away I mean
[49:55] so when Faith Comes in amen doubt goes
[49:58] out so the Dominion and the influence of
[50:00] Satan goes out when faith comes in amen
[50:03] and and how do you do that listen to the
[50:04] word of the hour listen to the message
[50:06] am mean get into the tapes whatever you
[50:08] do get into the Bible it will feed your
[50:10] soul give you strength but you see the
[50:12] devil's always trying to discredit your
[50:15] weapon amen if you've got confidence in
[50:18] your weapon you're go to battle and you
[50:20] won't be signing peace treaties and
[50:22] wondering if you can win if you know
[50:23] your weapon has already won the Warfare
[50:25] amen because weapon is the word of God
[50:27] the word of God conquered conquered
[50:29] Satan on the sea amen at lazarus's tomb
[50:32] there in the temple there on the cross
[50:34] down in Hell amen he conquered our
[50:37] weapon conquered him in every sphere
[50:39] that can be fought in amen and he's the
[50:41] same today but you see the devil wants
[50:43] us to always doubt can our weapon work
[50:46] in our situation sure it worked for them
[50:48] but what about you what is he trying to
[50:50] do he's trying to put Darkness into your
[50:53] life that you're wondering what's going
[50:54] on but may the light turn on that you
[50:57] can see him for what he is amen the Lord
[51:00] so he is almost he is almost harmless
[51:04] until he can work he can catch somebody
[51:07] that it can work through I pray that the
[51:10] devil can't work through our lives none
[51:13] of us amen he is he he's Bound by a
[51:15] chain of circumstance it's like a
[51:16] millennium in our lives the devil can't
[51:18] work nowhere he's got no one to work
[51:20] through amen amen this is what we're
[51:22] ordained for you're built for this amen
[51:26] where the devil sealed out God sealed in
[51:28] Hallelujah where the baptism of the Holy
[51:30] Ghost just so rules your life the word
[51:32] of God takes preeminence amen that the
[51:34] devil he can't do nothing with you he'll
[51:36] try every Booky trick in the book he'll
[51:39] try depression but the light turns on
[51:42] this isn't me I'm not just having a bad
[51:44] day there's a devil trying to drag me
[51:45] down I refuse to subc comeb to the thing
[51:47] Satan get out in the name of Jesus
[51:49] Christ well that Spirit of depression
[51:51] left then jealousy might try and come in
[51:53] well that person has this and you've got
[51:55] this and what about you and this person
[51:57] this family but then you realize no
[51:59] godliness when with contentment is great
[52:01] game God has made me thus this is my
[52:03] portion praise God I'm a Believer praise
[52:06] God I've got eternal life praise God
[52:08] that he's got my he's got my best
[52:10] interest in mind jealousy leaves amen
[52:14] amen you know you're going through a
[52:16] time of life maybe you're a teenager
[52:18] maybe going through through menopause
[52:20] whatever it is You' been to worry what's
[52:21] going to happen in my future where you
[52:22] going to realize God had my past he's
[52:25] got my present he's going to take care
[52:27] of me so that Spirit leaves you see so
[52:30] so God hallelujah see this weapon works
[52:34] this weapon works you know doubt comes
[52:36] in you know to me people question the
[52:38] word of God I say well you've come too
[52:40] late you should have you should have got
[52:43] you should have caught me before 2007
[52:45] when I met the Lord in September 200 he
[52:47] changed my life people you people can't
[52:50] come say well this message is fake no
[52:51] it's not fake because I met the god that
[52:55] brother Brown preached I met the god of
[52:57] the Bible and I didn't have a church to
[52:59] say now you do this and do this and do I
[53:01] had know all I had as an example was the
[53:03] Bible and the message I was a drunk
[53:05] University student God found me in that
[53:07] condition amen so don't say well God
[53:09] can't save me he saved me but see that's
[53:12] the devil trying to
[53:14] rule that's right amen so we got to
[53:17] realize that that the enemy has no power
[53:20] when the light turns on the enemy has no
[53:23] power amen I pray God turn the light on
[53:26] am amen see he's almost harmless now see
[53:30] now I just keep reading this CU I like
[53:31] it now then then when it can work
[53:33] through it will certainly do damage
[53:35] because it's an evil spirit and the Holy
[53:37] Spirit is here trying to find somebody
[53:39] to work through I'm here Lord I'm here
[53:42] Lord and when it find somebody to work
[53:44] through it can do good see the two
[53:46] Spirits their motives objectives am me
[53:48] watch it watch how it is watch their
[53:50] Works watch their fruits then you can
[53:52] see what spirit is on you amen so what
[53:55] is your objective amen if your objective
[53:57] is to is to just you know discredit the
[54:00] word and discredit Christianity all
[54:02] these things that's not the Holy Ghost
[54:04] but if the spirit on you is Lord I want
[54:06] you to live I want you to have
[54:07] preeminence lord I Love You Lord with
[54:09] all my heart what is that that's the
[54:10] Holy Ghost within you

[55:35] opportunity cuz God had ordained That
[55:37] season just like shamgar Shamar season
[55:39] after season he would come and defeat it
[55:42] he had his Harvest he you he'd bring it
[55:44] in but then he living in defeat not
[55:46] knowing who he was see he knew who God
[55:48] could be he knew who the Philistines
[55:50] were who the devil was but he didn't
[55:52] know who he really was he knew here yes
[55:54] I'm a son of Abraham I'm a circumcised
[55:56] you I'm living in my inheritance but he
[55:58] did not know who he really was I mean
[56:01] but then one day he went to church one
[56:03] day he went to church amen the preacher
[56:05] was preaching you're a son of Abraham
[56:07] God gave you a covenant amen you're a
[56:09] special class of people amen there's a
[56:10] blood of bulls and goats which are God
[56:12] ordained for you amen God gave your
[56:14] father Abraham a promise and God's going
[56:16] to fulfill that promise and then then
[56:19] that day wasn't for his neighbor was for
[56:21] him amen he walked out those doors a
[56:23] transformed person saying I'm a son of
[56:26] Abraham Hallelujah so when that day when
[56:29] he heard the boots of the Philistines
[56:31] stomping Down The Stomping down the road
[56:33] it wasn't a defeat came over him and
[56:35] said well I guess it'll be like last
[56:37] time he said no no what is this enemy
[56:39] squatting on my land what are these
[56:41] trespassers doing they've got no right
[56:42] what are you going to do Shamar I'll
[56:44] take what I've got I'm going to kill
[56:45] every one of them amen so he took what
[56:47] he say I don't have no faith he took an
[56:48] ox goat Hallelujah David had a sling
[56:52] amen what's in your hand Moses had a
[56:55] Shepherd staff what's in your hand amen
[56:58] hallelujah should be the word of God's
[56:59] in your hand oh I don't have much Faith
[57:01] well you you had no faith to get saved
[57:03] you had no faith to give your life to
[57:05] the Lord that's plenty to start fighting
[57:07] with and God will just increase it as
[57:09] you walk with him amen so never think
[57:11] you are unable to do the
[57:14] job but you see shamgar came to a point
[57:17] where he realized who he was and he
[57:20] wasn't a victim anymore he was an
[57:21] overcomer he was ordained to be an
[57:24] overcomer amen so I pray go but what
[57:26] happened the light came on the light
[57:28] came on in his life and he saw he he
[57:31] narrowly looked upon those Philistines
[57:33] and considered
[57:34] them these men are
[57:36] uncircumcised God made no Covenant with
[57:39] them their trespassers see the devil's a
[57:41] squatter we're going to consider this
[57:43] guy he has no he he has no eternal life
[57:46] to give anyone hell was made for him
[57:50] he's just a squatter upon the earth I
[57:52] mean he's got nothing good to give
[57:54] anyone he's just got empty promises
[57:56] broken lives he produces that's all he
[57:58] does Amen he's a squatter he's a
[58:00] trespasser he's a he's a fired servant
[58:03] angels are servants right he got fired
[58:07] cuz he tried to live above his job
[58:09] description he was the CH anointed
[58:11] cherub that cover basically God said
[58:12] this is your job I've made you for he
[58:15] should have stayed in that position but
[58:16] he but Pride came in he elevated himself
[58:19] above his job description and God said
[58:21] you're fired right right he's fired so
[58:25] now we're fighting against a fired
[58:27] servant we aren't
[58:29] servants we are the sons and daughters
[58:32] of God we are his children amen you go
[58:35] to the royal family it doesn't matter if
[58:37] a Butler's been serving the royal family
[58:39] for 80 hundred whatever many years they
[58:41] will never
[58:42] become the son because they were never
[58:46] born of the king and queen right doesn't
[58:49] matter how long they've been here they
[58:50] know the protocol they can do all the
[58:52] things they don't have the
[58:54] authority of a son
[58:57] amen the devil has no he thinks he has
[58:59] the authority but he ain't got nothing
[59:02] right all he has is deception he has no
[59:04] Authority compared to you that's right
[59:06] he's he's a fired servant even even the
[59:08] archangels of God that never did
[59:11] fall when you begin to pray if they're
[59:14] talking to God they say shh my children
[59:16] are talking to me you can be in such a
[59:19] state you can be feel so low you can
[59:21] feel like how you even a believer how
[59:23] you even keeping on you begin to talk to
[59:25] God and he tells heaven to be quiet my
[59:28] daughter's talking to me amen they take
[59:30] priority over you cuz you're a servant
[59:32] but they're my children there's nothing
[59:34] like your children talking to you I mean
[59:36] there's nothing like your family talking
[59:38] it's it's it's a whole greater Dimension
[59:40] than just someone else you may love the
[59:42] other people but it's your family it's
[59:44] part of you you see them you know
[59:46] they're part of you you're part of them
[59:48] amen and when God looks down upon us now
[59:50] he's not looking at this guy uh
[59:52] Hallelujah he's looking at this guy I me
[59:54] but when he looks down upon us he SE see
[59:56] some self in flesh Hallelujah and so
[59:59] when we begin to pray amen they have to
[1:00:01] shut up cuz he's listening to us I put
[1:00:03] it that way amen
[1:00:06] so we we must consider this enemy and
[1:00:11] realize that it's more than just going
[1:00:13] back to that it's more than just having
[1:00:15] a bad day when a spirit's trying to
[1:00:18] oppress you you got to realize what it
[1:00:19] is now this is a very this is a time
[1:00:22] when mental health has gone through the
[1:00:24] roof it's amazing how the Apostle Paul
[1:00:27] would speak about these things says
[1:00:28] wherefore I put thee in remembrance that
[1:00:30] thou stir up the gift of God which is in
[1:00:32] thee by the putting on of my hands for
[1:00:34] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[1:00:37] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:00:39] mind amen so this spirit so so this is
[1:00:42] Timothy he's trying to encourage Timothy
[1:00:44] Timothy's gone through some hard roads
[1:00:46] he's been maybe he's been pardon me
[1:00:48] rejected maybe made fun of criticized
[1:00:50] persecuted and and and and and God is
[1:00:53] using the Apostle Paul to pour in some
[1:00:55] pour in some encouragement pouring some
[1:00:58] Revelation pouring some strength and we
[1:00:59] need this sometimes we go through
[1:01:01] battles we get discouraged we get
[1:01:04] knocked back and we wonder Lord am I
[1:01:05] really you know walking and you know we
[1:01:07] can we can question our own experience
[1:01:10] and this is why he's trying to stir
[1:01:11] Timothy up Timothy before these troubles
[1:01:15] ever came in your life God ordained you
[1:01:17] there was a gift and we know the gift
[1:01:19] actually did not come upon him because
[1:01:21] Paul put his hands upon him that's a
[1:01:23] sanctioning or a or a public testimony
[1:01:25] that that gift was in him cuz he said
[1:01:26] the faith that was in your grandmother L
[1:01:28] I'm persuaded is in you right so so
[1:01:32] Timothy was getting under a a a a attack
[1:01:35] and so God was God was using using the
[1:01:38] Apostle Paul to say look God is not this
[1:01:40] spirit this fear is not god-given
[1:01:43] we got to realize amen because God has
[1:01:47] not given us the spirit of fear but of
[1:01:48] power and of love and of sound mind amen
[1:01:52] be thou therefore be be not that um thou
[1:01:55] there for ashamed of the testimony of
[1:01:57] your lord nor of me his prisoner but be
[1:02:00] thou partaker of the afflictions of The
[1:02:01] Gospel According to the power of God who
[1:02:04] hath saved us and has called us with a
[1:02:06] holy and holy calling not according to
[1:02:08] our works but according to his own
[1:02:10] purpose and Grace which has given us in
[1:02:13] Christ Jesus before the foundation of
[1:02:15] the world but it is now made manifest by
[1:02:17] the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ
[1:02:20] who hath abolished death and ha brought
[1:02:22] life and immortality to light through
[1:02:24] the gospel amen amen this is what he's
[1:02:26] given so so there comes a time when we
[1:02:29] got to really realize what the enemy is
[1:02:32] doing there be many times people would
[1:02:34] come up before brother Braham in the
[1:02:36] prayer line you know the angels of the
[1:02:37] Lord would be there and they' be
[1:02:38] Discerning God would reveal to him
[1:02:40] what's going wrong and brother BR would
[1:02:42] say the whole purpose of this was Faith
[1:02:44] would rise that people would receive
[1:02:45] their healing or their Deliverance right
[1:02:47] it's a nervousness the only thing sir
[1:02:49] you think deep you cross Bridges before
[1:02:51] you get to them taking other things upon
[1:02:54] your heart and you're always planning
[1:02:55] something something that never happens
[1:02:57] and it's only it's only mentally nervous
[1:02:59] it's a mental nervousness that's right
[1:03:01] you've been that way for years but Jesus
[1:03:04] Christ is here to take it off of you
[1:03:06] amen there's a dark shadow follows you
[1:03:08] all the time you're conscious that
[1:03:09] something's near you like that all the
[1:03:11] time so here with someone they always
[1:03:13] troubled they deep thinking deep about
[1:03:15] things they'll be making plans those
[1:03:17] plans would never come to pass and you
[1:03:19] know they're always nervous and they
[1:03:20] always felt like something was following
[1:03:22] them but they didn't know what it was
[1:03:25] right and maybe he's well he's been this
[1:03:27] way for years so maybe he's thinking
[1:03:29] this is just me this is just my makeup
[1:03:31] and part of it being a deep thinker is a
[1:03:33] makeup of a person but the devil will
[1:03:35] use your makeup against you just like
[1:03:38] God wants to use it for his glory the
[1:03:40] devil wants to use it against you so
[1:03:42] here's someone who just thinks maybe he
[1:03:43] just thinks this is just how I am but he
[1:03:45] doesn't realize it's a spirit bothering
[1:03:48] him amen do you believe that God's going
[1:03:50] to take it from you now Satan leave this
[1:03:52] man come out of the man in the name of
[1:03:53] Jesus Christ go out of the man iure thee
[1:03:55] by the Living God that you torment him
[1:03:57] no more raise up your hand sir you're
[1:03:59] free for the first time since you was a
[1:04:01] child my what a long time to have this
[1:04:04] kind of a thing but he thought maybe
[1:04:05] it's just part of him but you see what
[1:04:07] happened the light turned on and then he
[1:04:09] saw this is not him this is the enemy
[1:04:12] trying to keep him down keep him troubl
[1:04:14] keep him upset keep him nervous keep him
[1:04:16] this way but God said no no this is not
[1:04:18] my ordained this is not how you're meant
[1:04:20] to be you're meant to have dominion over
[1:04:22] this thing you're meant to have peace
[1:04:24] and joy the love of God flowing through
[1:04:26] your life amen amen so this so so he
[1:04:28] says now Hallelujah see do you believe
[1:04:31] him right now see go sorry go on your
[1:04:33] road rejoicing at faith in God do you
[1:04:35] believe him right now go over this
[1:04:37] audience it seems to be a Milky hazes
[1:04:38] hanging there I'm not a fanatic I'm a
[1:04:40] Christian I believe that the Lord Jesus
[1:04:42] is right here now to make every person
[1:04:44] well amen amen here's another one from a
[1:04:47] different message there's a woman
[1:04:48] standing before me now uh do you have a
[1:04:51] uh uh it says do you have a nervousness
[1:04:53] it's a mental nervousness you're always
[1:04:54] upset the devil has tried to tell you
[1:04:56] that you've crossed a separating line
[1:04:59] many things just get so tore up and
[1:05:01] especially the evening and afternoon see
[1:05:04] so this comes a season time in the day
[1:05:07] where this flares up in her life isn't
[1:05:10] that right you get real nervous you Tire
[1:05:12] real quickly have to sit down can't
[1:05:14] stand up yes that's right it's a
[1:05:16] nervousness come here you believe God
[1:05:18] give me Authority if he can take make
[1:05:20] the blindest see do you believe uh he
[1:05:21] could he could Cast Away cast that away
[1:05:24] from you almighty God to hold her hands
[1:05:26] she's your child my sister have mercy on
[1:05:28] her Satan come out of her in the name of
[1:05:30] Jesus Christ leave the woman that's it
[1:05:31] lady will you do as I tell you go out of
[1:05:34] here just singing rejoicing and happy
[1:05:36] think nothing about it it's gone from
[1:05:37] you you're going to be well amen so
[1:05:40] these people thought this is just how
[1:05:42] they're built and you know afternoon
[1:05:43] evening where you just get tired this is
[1:05:45] why she's got to sit down and she you
[1:05:47] know you know she can't do things but it
[1:05:48] was a spirit bothering her amen but see
[1:05:53] when the light turned on she realized
[1:05:55] that for what it is and this is why God
[1:05:57] turned the light on in our life that we
[1:06:00] would see what's bothering me what's
[1:06:03] afflicting me is it just me or is it a
[1:06:07] spirit bothering me if it's a spirit
[1:06:09] then God gives you dominion over it
[1:06:11] right I hope this is okay today amen but
[1:06:14] you see now we've got to we got to
[1:06:15] discern the enemy in all of his tricks
[1:06:18] that's how we overcome amen we can
[1:06:20] really discern what he's doing
[1:06:23] now now this here as we come back to
[1:06:26] this now now morai he did not bow to
[1:06:29] hmon morai did not bow to hmon now to me
[1:06:32] this is more than just because he was a
[1:06:35] Jew but morai Mori was of The Tribe of
[1:06:39] Benjamin amen Esther was of The Tribe of
[1:06:42] Benjamin then because because Mori was
[1:06:44] her uncle now there was a prophecy that
[1:06:47] was given the now now hmon was an agot
[1:06:50] now this is significant because King AAG
[1:06:52] was the was the one that Saul did not
[1:06:54] kill when God told Saul to go kill the
[1:06:57] amalekites so an agagite is an amalaki
[1:07:00] now the first time that Israel ever came
[1:07:03] into battle against the against the
[1:07:05] amalekites was in Exodus chapter 17
[1:07:08] where where uh where where amalik came
[1:07:10] and fought um with Israel and then Moses
[1:07:13] told Joshua he says look I'm going to go
[1:07:15] up on the mountain and you I'm going to
[1:07:18] raise up my hands and and and if my
[1:07:20] hands are raised you're going to win the
[1:07:21] victory amen and then so what happened
[1:07:23] is when moses' hands went down they
[1:07:25] begin to lose when his hands got risen
[1:07:27] up they begin to win now the the way
[1:07:31] they won was not their ability now I
[1:07:33] just want to see this this Victory
[1:07:35] started because a man's hands were
[1:07:37] raised I mean so that'd be so it wasn't
[1:07:39] how sharp their swords were how how how
[1:07:41] well they could fight as long as moses'
[1:07:43] hands were raised up they were winning
[1:07:45] amen so now now because when your hands
[1:07:47] are raised this is a sign of Victory
[1:07:50] right the first time hands were raised
[1:07:51] to win a victory was Moses and they'd be
[1:07:53] cutting they'd be fighting if they just
[1:07:55] looked up they would see on a hill a man
[1:07:56] with his hands raised and they and and
[1:07:59] they kept winning because what Moses was
[1:08:00] doing and then now when Samson was in
[1:08:02] the temple he what did he do he is
[1:08:04] blinded there in the temple of deeon he
[1:08:06] raised his hands he said Lord avenge my
[1:08:08] eyes I'm willing to die with my enemy
[1:08:10] and he pushed the pillars and won a
[1:08:12] great Victory why because it's a sign of
[1:08:14] surrender amen but those two victories
[1:08:16] pale nothing compared am mean to our
[1:08:18] Lord Jesus amen there was hanging
[1:08:20] between heavens and earth his hands were
[1:08:21] raised outstretched amen he conquered
[1:08:24] how death in the grave
[1:08:26] amen so as we're fighting in the valley
[1:08:28] we just got to look up on the hill and
[1:08:29] realize our Lord's going to be like this
[1:08:31] interceding for us acting on our behalf
[1:08:34] until all of God's children come home
[1:08:36] amen so if you haven't come home today
[1:08:38] come home come home to him this morning
[1:08:41] amen you going to realize it's not your
[1:08:42] ability in the battle it's the fact his
[1:08:44] hands are been raised am mean the
[1:08:45] victory is won because of what he is
[1:08:48] doing Hallelujah that's why we're
[1:08:50] fighting a battle you've already won I
[1:08:52] mean we may be hot and heavy the battle
[1:08:54] may be struggling in battle and real but
[1:08:56] no we've already won it cuz he's won it
[1:08:58] amen so as you're taking the word of God
[1:09:00] Amen you're fighting the enemy with the
[1:09:02] word of God you're quoting the scripture
[1:09:04] I mean you're you're listening to songs
[1:09:06] that build Faith listening to messages
[1:09:07] that build Faith amen and you're
[1:09:09] training for the battle realize he's
[1:09:11] already won the battle amen but you got
[1:09:13] to you've got to train see uh I think
[1:09:17] it's I think you know you know um I we
[1:09:19] come to this actually let's just drop
[1:09:20] down to this
[1:09:21] so you know and because we got to walk
[1:09:27] purposely I know the Olympics are on
[1:09:29] this is not why this is but you see Paul
[1:09:31] would say this no you not that they
[1:09:33] which run in a race run all but one
[1:09:35] receiveth the prize so run that you may
[1:09:38] obtain we don't run this race to to get
[1:09:41] a participation award at the
[1:09:43] end we're running to win we're running
[1:09:46] this Christian Life to win right and
[1:09:49] every man that striveth for Mastery is
[1:09:51] temper in all things that they do it to
[1:09:54] obtain a corruptible crown but we and
[1:09:56] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[1:10:00] uncertainly it's not thinking will it
[1:10:02] work how's it going to happen no I'm
[1:10:04] certain my destination is secure am am
[1:10:07] mean so fight I not as one that beateth

[1:10:12] actually means to box that's what this
[1:10:15] word boxes you know and and and and to

[1:10:19] to fight that he's going to land punches

[1:10:35] walk we don't want to be
[1:10:37] swinging without purpose no right we
[1:10:40] want to realize there's purpose in
[1:10:42] reading the word you say well I don't
[1:10:45] really get anything out of it what do
[1:10:46] you get out of social
[1:10:48] media I just I just realized a while ago

[1:10:52] and not remember anything then read
[1:10:54] social media remember and and remember
[1:10:57] nothing what feeds my soul Facebook
[1:11:00] ain't feeding my soul or Instagram or
[1:11:03] whatever you're doing you know you
[1:11:06] see right so we want to we want to be
[1:11:09] praying with
[1:11:10] purpose we're going to be walking with
[1:11:13] purpose why do we go why you say it's
[1:11:14] just another Monday tomorrow there's
[1:11:16] purpose in that day amen right we're not
[1:11:18] just occupying time we're not just
[1:11:20] filling up space and going through the
[1:11:22] motions no every day has a purpose right
[1:11:25] so say Lord I want to live your purpose
[1:11:27] in this day I want to walk with you am
[1:11:29] mean not not not I want to run not
[1:11:31] uncertainly but but certain amen I want
[1:11:35] to I want to do everything with purpose
[1:11:38] well what's your purpose Lord I want to
[1:11:39] draw closer to you I want to see your
[1:11:42] presence move in my life in a greater
[1:11:43] way I want to see Revival strike every
[1:11:45] heart I want to see your promises
[1:11:47] fulfilled Lord I want to see my children
[1:11:49] filled with the Holy Ghost Lord I want
[1:11:51] to see my way with loved ones come home
[1:11:53] Lord see it should be purpose Lord
[1:11:54] hallelujah not just talking to you Lord
[1:11:56] just to you know you say well I don't
[1:11:57] know how to pray pray him then if you
[1:12:00] don't know how to pray or how to ask for
[1:12:02] things just give him glory amen amen
[1:12:05] amen and then you'll start then he'll
[1:12:07] put on your heart what to pray for
[1:12:09] because you get into that channel of
[1:12:10] inspiration hallelujah amen so so we
[1:12:13] want to run this race with purpose now
[1:12:16] as I said about I said about um uh Mori
[1:12:21] going back to this he he did not bow
[1:12:23] because of purpose and it wasn't because
[1:12:25] of Pride it wasn't just because he was a
[1:12:27] Jew but there was prophecy he was living
[1:12:31] in because after this when they
[1:12:33] prevailed here it says and the Lord said
[1:12:36] unto Moses write this for a memorial in
[1:12:38] a book and rehearse it in the ears of
[1:12:40] Joshua so rehearse it in the years of uh
[1:12:42] ears of the Next
[1:12:44] Generation for I will uly put out the
[1:12:46] remembrance of amch from under heaven
[1:12:49] and Moses built an altar and called the
[1:12:51] name of Jehovah Nissi for he said
[1:12:53] because the Lord has sworn that that the
[1:12:55] Lord will have war with AMC from
[1:12:58] generation to generation now keep the
[1:13:00] spiritual in mind when I'm talking about
[1:13:01] this cuz we don't wrestle against flesh
[1:13:02] and blood right we wrestle against
[1:13:04] principalities wickedness evilness and
[1:13:06] high places right so God to me here God
[1:13:09] is saying that he's going to fight the
[1:13:11] devil from generation to generation he's
[1:13:13] going to utterly blot out Satan from
[1:13:16] under heaven right he's going to not
[1:13:17] even be ashes on the field he's going to
[1:13:19] be nothing when everything's said and
[1:13:20] done there's going to be no existence of
[1:13:22] him there's going to be no Memorial of
[1:13:23] him there's no grave of him he's going
[1:13:25] to be nothing he's not even going to be
[1:13:27] Vapor nothing he's going to be
[1:13:29] absolutely nothing when it's all done
[1:13:30] why cuz he's going to be absolutely
[1:13:32] blotted from under Heaven amen right but
[1:13:34] he's going to fight from generation to
[1:13:36] generation now now as I
[1:13:39] said Mori was a Mori was the of The
[1:13:43] Tribe of Benjamin now that was the same
[1:13:45] tribe that Saul was from and Saul did
[1:13:49] not fulfill the word of God by taking
[1:13:51] out the amalekites like he should have
[1:13:54] right so just because someone someone
[1:13:57] that was forly in you know someone
[1:13:59] previous in the family failed at
[1:14:01] fulfilling all the word of God doesn't
[1:14:02] mean you have to amen I believe God if
[1:14:05] there's great failures in the past God
[1:14:07] will raise up people from that same
[1:14:09] family to fulfill this to fulfill the
[1:14:11] word to break the cycle maybe
[1:14:13] Generations past our families went into
[1:14:15] idolatry they one time walking with God
[1:14:18] they went into darkness God will use
[1:14:20] that same family line this is just me I
[1:14:22] don't know I might be wrong but God will
[1:14:23] raise up someone where the devil says
[1:14:26] but look what your forbears did but God
[1:14:28] will raise you up to say I'm not built
[1:14:30] of that cuz I'm a New Creation in Christ
[1:14:31] Jesus amen that no God is going to use
[1:14:34] me to break the cycle amen maybe you've
[1:14:36] always been in uh uh reverent to
[1:14:38] religion you know you know you our
[1:14:40] forbears they didn't care about God they
[1:14:41] weren't interested or maybe they're just
[1:14:43] religious people but then God turned on
[1:14:45] the light in your life am mean God began
[1:14:47] to live in your life what happened he's
[1:14:49] breaking that cycle of what they could
[1:14:50] not do you're now
[1:14:53] doing amen so he was of the but you see
[1:14:56] now
[1:14:58] Mori this is just
[1:15:01] me would have realized oh hmon is an
[1:15:04] agite so he could consider him for who
[1:15:07] he really was he wasn't just a Persian
[1:15:10] or wasn't just someone else no he was an
[1:15:12] agery it was very significant that that
[1:15:14] morai knew who his enemy was you see
[1:15:17] that's what I'm saying it's very it's
[1:15:18] very important we know who our enemy is
[1:15:21] see because because Mori was a man of
[1:15:23] God when he found out that hmon was an
[1:15:26] agot he' say ah God said he's going to
[1:15:29] fight a um amalec from generation to
[1:15:32] generation and now this battle's falling
[1:15:34] on my lap amen but I'm living in
[1:15:37] Prophecy now that I'm not going to be
[1:15:40] defeated amen that Victory is going to
[1:15:42] come amen because God's prophesied it
[1:15:45] amen that's why it's so important
[1:15:46] friends we realize where we're going I
[1:15:49] mean that that that is proph we're
[1:15:50] living under prophecy where you will be
[1:15:53] changed in a moment and twinkling of an
[1:15:55] amen cuz this word has transforming
[1:15:57] power see it's no it's no haphazard
[1:15:59] thing you've come into this message it's
[1:16:01] not it's not just a random occurrence of
[1:16:03] events that have come no God has
[1:16:05] ordained it that you'd hear a word that
[1:16:07] will transform your body that will
[1:16:09] restore you back to the original faith
[1:16:10] of the fathers amen that when you read
[1:16:12] the book of Acts you see your own life
[1:16:14] in there cuz the same God that lived
[1:16:15] back then is the same God that lives in
[1:16:17] you now amen so so it's not a haphazard
[1:16:20] thing you see so when we realize no
[1:16:22] we're part of the Rapture I me cuz we're
[1:16:24] part of God then we realize we're living
[1:16:27] under prophecy where we're not ordained
[1:16:28] to go into the Great Tribulation amen
[1:16:31] glory to God hallelujah amen so now Mori
[1:16:35] could could stand there and say I'm not
[1:16:37] bowing cuz my God has spoken about you
[1:16:40] just like we read Isaiah my God has
[1:16:42] spoken about you devil and you're going
[1:16:44] to come to the sides of the pit you said
[1:16:46] you're going up and you're going down
[1:16:49] and I'm going up amen he said you're
[1:16:51] going down God the devil said you're
[1:16:53] going down but God said you're going up
[1:16:56] hallelujah amen so he could stand there
[1:17:00] now morai could not go on before the
[1:17:03] king but Esther could Esther was part of
[1:17:07] this prophecy hope you give me that
[1:17:09] Liberty this morning all right but you
[1:17:11] see now there came a point where where
[1:17:14] Esther morai had to speak to Esther to
[1:17:18] get her to to to possess the position
[1:17:21] she was now living in see we got to
[1:17:24] realize who are see they all knew who
[1:17:26] the king was the king says this it
[1:17:29] happens he makes a law it cannot be
[1:17:31] reversed the King has Absolute Power
[1:17:33] King of has awar us can do whatever he
[1:17:35] wants whenever he wants however he wants
[1:17:37] and no one can stop it you see just like
[1:17:39] our lord Jesus he can do whatever he
[1:17:41] wants whatever he wants however he wants
[1:17:44] amen it'll be his word of course but
[1:17:46] nothing can stop him the devil can't
[1:17:48] stop him amen so we can realize yes the
[1:17:52] Lord is all powerful but now God is put
[1:17:55] us in a position to draw out from God
[1:17:58] his attributes right enem is to be
[1:18:01] delivered to be to be a Healer to be a
[1:18:03] redeemer to be a savior all those things
[1:18:06] are in him to be a protector a shield a
[1:18:08] comforter a guide but he God has put us
[1:18:10] in a position by the blood of Jesus
[1:18:12] Christ so we can draw from God what we
[1:18:14] have need of Amen but we have to do it
[1:18:17] amen amen so you see now
[1:18:19] ether ether was in the position where
[1:18:23] where she could
[1:18:25] do that Mori couldn't now they're living
[1:18:28] under the they're living under the um
[1:18:30] sentence of death we know here where
[1:18:33] where um you know hmon got the law
[1:18:36] written that you know that the Jews are
[1:18:37] going to be killed on the 13th day of
[1:18:39] Adar and all those things they're living
[1:18:41] under a death sentence but but Esther
[1:18:43] Esther had already found favor in the S
[1:18:45] side of the king amen you know you found
[1:18:47] great favor in the sight of God we found
[1:18:51] abundant favor I really wish we could
[1:18:53] look past this realm the these five
[1:18:56] senses and you could see your spiritual
[1:18:58] State you can rarely see your spiritual
[1:19:00] state am me where you passed from Death
[1:19:02] unto life there's no there's therefore
[1:19:05] no there's no condemnation that to them
[1:19:07] which you're in Christ Jesus right that
[1:19:09] you're actually safe as safe can be I
[1:19:12] mean there's nothing between your soul
[1:19:13] and your savior you're seal to the day
[1:19:14] of your Redemption amen I wish we could
[1:19:16] really see that then all the you know
[1:19:19] then all the battles I think would just
[1:19:20] we' just charge in we'd have a greater
[1:19:23] confidence I know in whom I have
[1:19:24] believed amen he is my king my shield my
[1:19:27] rock and I can trust him no matter what
[1:19:29] goes on but you see now as Mori said to
[1:19:33] Esther you've got to go before the king
[1:19:34] but Esther replied all the king's
[1:19:36] servants and the people of the um of the
[1:19:38] king's provinces do know that whosoever
[1:19:40] whether man or woman shall come into the
[1:19:42] king into the inner Court who is not
[1:19:44] called there is one law of his to put um
[1:19:48] to put him to death except thou except
[1:19:50] such to whom the king shall hold out the
[1:19:52] golden scepter that he may live but I
[1:19:55] have not been called to come in unto the
[1:19:57] king these 30
[1:19:58] days and now notice now now all the
[1:20:01] king's servants and the people of the
[1:20:03] king's provinces and it's either men or
[1:20:05] women but Esther was part of the king
[1:20:08] she was in a different category she
[1:20:11] wasn't a servant she wasn't a person of
[1:20:13] the Kingdom anymore she was part of the
[1:20:15] king you
[1:20:17] see so that law was actually overridden
[1:20:20] by the grace of
[1:20:22] God Amen now then then Mori would say
[1:20:25] for if thou altogether holdest thy peace
[1:20:28] at this time then shall um then shall
[1:20:31] there enlargement and deliverance arise
[1:20:33] to the Jews from another place but thou
[1:20:35] and thy father's house shall be
[1:20:37] destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou
[1:20:38] Art come to the kingdom for a Time such
[1:20:40] as this see you're here for a reason
[1:20:42] then Esther B them B them return to Mori
[1:20:45] this answer go gather together all the
[1:20:47] Jews that are present in shushan and
[1:20:49] fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink
[1:20:52] three days day or uh night or day and I
[1:20:54] also my maidens will Fast likewise and
[1:20:58] so will I go in unto the King which is
[1:21:00] not according to the law and if I perish
[1:21:02] I perish so Mori went his way and did
[1:21:05] according to all that Esther had
[1:21:06] commanded him now her approach I mean
[1:21:08] her approach to go to the King was with
[1:21:12] reverence she didn't just burst in there
[1:21:14] and say hey King o hubby listen this is
[1:21:19] gone on no she approached him the right
[1:21:21] way right even though she was the queen
[1:21:24] even though she was part of him she
[1:21:27] still approached him with reverence and
[1:21:29] respect you see and and there is great
[1:21:31] power and reverence amen just like the
[1:21:34] Bible says that wives should reverence
[1:21:35] their husband that's what husbands need
[1:21:37] love and you respect and reverence
[1:21:40] that's what they need women wives need
[1:21:43] love husbands need reverence and respect
[1:21:44] see if you just have those two things in
[1:21:46] your mind as you treat one another you
[1:21:48] just see your relationships
[1:21:51] Bloom amen that's what I was trying to
[1:21:54] cap off from last Sunday but you see she
[1:21:56] did not come in just just any old way
[1:21:58] she said no we're going to fast and pray
[1:22:00] I'm going to go with
[1:22:01] sincerity amen because I'm not going in
[1:22:03] according to the law the Lord say uh the
[1:22:05] law says I can be killed so I'm going to
[1:22:08] go in but if I perish I
[1:22:10] perish then on the third day Esther put
[1:22:13] on her royal apparel stood in the inner
[1:22:14] Court of the King's house over against
[1:22:16] the King's house and the King sat upon
[1:22:18] his Royal throne and the Royal house
[1:22:20] over against the Gate of the house and
[1:22:21] it was so when the king saw Esther the
[1:22:23] queen standing in the court she obtained
[1:22:26] favor in his sight amen so the king's
[1:22:28] favor which she had already found favor
[1:22:30] when when she was made Queen in the
[1:22:32] first place amen but then but she
[1:22:34] obtained favor in his sight so so the
[1:22:37] King extended his Royal scepter out to
[1:22:39] Esther amen and we know that the law
[1:22:42] condemned us but Grace was extended in
[1:22:44] Jesus Christ unto us amen and what so
[1:22:47] why because we obtain favor in his sight
[1:22:50] Hallelujah and then the king began to
[1:22:51] ask what is your request he says what
[1:22:54] thou Queen Esther so he's he's speaking
[1:22:57] to her according to her position amen
[1:23:00] what is your request amen it shall be
[1:23:02] given to the even half of the Kingdom
[1:23:04] now that doesn't mean necessarily the
[1:23:06] kingdom would be divided but but she's
[1:23:08] joint ears with him I'll make you a
[1:23:09] joint ear amen and we are May joint ears
[1:23:12] with Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:23:14] amen so she came in with reverence amen
[1:23:17] because she realized that well she knew
[1:23:20] she could speak to the king and get what
[1:23:23] she needed for the Deliverance of her
[1:23:25] people are you following me today I mean
[1:23:27] we're going to realize we have there's
[1:23:28] great I'm I I may sound like a broken
[1:23:30] record but hey I'll tell that devil to
[1:23:32] shut up we have great Authority in our
[1:23:35] position brother Braham says when the
[1:23:37] bride when the church realizes what she
[1:23:40] is then the Rapture will go when we
[1:23:42] really realize not in here but in here
[1:23:45] we're part of this word and we're part
[1:23:47] of our King am me you can't divide the
[1:23:49] two of us anymore like husband and wife
[1:23:51] they become one right God and his
[1:23:54] brother become one Hallelujah why
[1:23:57] there's there's an you know the blood
[1:23:59] makes an atonement right which is an
[1:24:01] atement we become one by the blood of
[1:24:05] Jesus Christ amen there's an at onement
[1:24:07] that takes place you can't find a se you
[1:24:10] can't find a gap that's right Hallelujah
[1:24:12] you one husband and wife become one
[1:24:14] Christ and his bride become one there
[1:24:17] you cannot divide them Hallelujah why
[1:24:20] cuz there's an atment has taken place
[1:24:22] amen and if you're not under the blood
[1:24:24] becometh one with God by the
[1:24:27] blood amen so she went in there she
[1:24:29] asked them to come to a feast amen and
[1:24:31] we know that they you know then they had
[1:24:33] a banquet of wine they enjoyed it that
[1:24:35] night the king couldn't sleep and you
[1:24:37] know he asked for the palace records to
[1:24:39] come open and you know the you know the
[1:24:41] um pardon me the Scribe was
[1:24:43] reading where where morai saved the
[1:24:46] King's life and we know that everything
[1:24:47] reversed there when the book came open
[1:24:49] am mean then they had another banquet of
[1:24:51] wine the king asked what is your request
[1:24:53] Esther and the Queen said and then the
[1:24:55] queen began to pour our her heart out to
[1:24:57] the king and you see that's why it's so
[1:24:59] important amen we worship God we worship
[1:25:03] God Amen we worship Him in song we
[1:25:05] worship him when the word Goes Forth we
[1:25:07] worship him in our everyday life our
[1:25:09] life is a worship to God what does it do
[1:25:11] that moves the heart of the king you
[1:25:14] know churches are actually a banquet of
[1:25:16] wines Revelation stimulation by
[1:25:19] revelation of the word I people get
[1:25:21] happy they get loose they get relaxed as
[1:25:23] the word Goes Forth as the ano anointing
[1:25:24] pours out what's happening you're
[1:25:26] drinking spiritual wine and when God
[1:25:28] begins to see us respond to him it moves
[1:25:30] his
[1:25:32] heart what is your request what do you
[1:25:34] have need of what do you have need of in
[1:25:37] 2024 amen we say this spirit's been
[1:25:39] troubling me this wicked man hmon who
[1:25:42] wants to destroy me destroy my family
[1:25:45] destroy everyone I me it's this one and
[1:25:47] then what does that do that causes the
[1:25:48] wrath of God to be poured out against
[1:25:50] your
[1:25:51] enemy hallelujah it's more than a story
[1:25:53] friends a reality who's ever had a time
[1:25:55] of real righteous ignation you have a
[1:25:57] right to get mad at the Devil you don't
[1:25:59] get mad at people you get mad at the
[1:26:00] Spirit you have a right to get real mad
[1:26:03] amen at that Spirit when the devil tries
[1:26:05] to come in and take you or whatever you
[1:26:06] you get mad at him say Satan how dare
[1:26:08] you squatter get out in the name of
[1:26:11] Jesus Christ he say I tried that you
[1:26:13] just keep you just keep
[1:26:15] going cuz the devil try to say no I have
[1:26:17] a right here no you have no right here
[1:26:19] he doesn't just quit no he'll call your
[1:26:22] he'll call what you what he thinks is
[1:26:24] your BL but where if you really got
[1:26:25] something in you he has to
[1:26:27] leave amen praise the Lord amen remember
[1:26:31] when Christian I were first married we
[1:26:32] came back from Papa New Guinea God did
[1:26:34] wonderful things there and she you know
[1:26:36] ended up in hospital with seizures every
[1:26:38] so often she'd be normal then she'd just
[1:26:40] start shaking become unresponsive right
[1:26:43] side or left side whichever side was
[1:26:44] shaking you know and then she come
[1:26:46] normal again and so in me I'm like and
[1:26:49] and we were just newly WS but in me you
[1:26:52] know because the Bible says him that
[1:26:54] seeketh shall find him that knocketh it
[1:26:57] shall be open so when this is all going
[1:26:59] on and she's in hospital I was back
[1:27:00] where we were staying I was praying Lord
[1:27:02] him that seeketh shall find is this a
[1:27:04] long trial is a short trial I don't know
[1:27:07] but you are the answer to this problem
[1:27:08] Lord am mean she's not meant to be in
[1:27:10] this condition am mean and I got to I
[1:27:12] don't know how but I got a breakthrough
[1:27:13] in prayer I knew God's going to answer
[1:27:15] now Hallelujah don't you love don't you
[1:27:18] love it when you pray through amen when
[1:27:20] you really your peace comes you know
[1:27:22] God's going to answer the prayer amen
[1:27:24] the next time went into the hospital she
[1:27:25] said you know there's a dark cloud
[1:27:26] always comes over my vision it feels
[1:27:28] like I'm going to be jump off a cliff or
[1:27:30] be pushed off a cliff and this Cloud
[1:27:31] comes over my vision and then and you
[1:27:33] know and then I start shaking and then
[1:27:35] she said it's coming on me now we prayed
[1:27:37] rebuked the thing I think that afternoon
[1:27:39] she was out of the hospital amen why
[1:27:41] because no because remember prayer Works
[1:27:45] prayer works it's not empty words amen
[1:27:47] we're going to have a real anchor in our
[1:27:49] heart we can go before our King whenever
[1:27:51] we need to amen and he hears our prayers
[1:27:54] you say well the answer seems to be a
[1:27:55] long time away that's irrelevant am me
[1:27:58] as long as you break through and you
[1:28:00] feel that a peace comes you say God
[1:28:02] you're going to answer this Hallelujah
[1:28:04] he may not even tell you exactly how
[1:28:06] he's going to do it but he's going to do
[1:28:07] it then you can go on confidence God and
[1:28:10] then then what do you do you praise him
[1:28:11] because the answer's been given
[1:28:14] Hallelujah Abraham spent 25 years when
[1:28:16] when when Isaac became a revelation
[1:28:20] Hallelujah to Abraham hallelujah
[1:28:22] hallelujah he his life turned into a
[1:28:26] praise is this okay amen because because
[1:28:29] it was because Revelation declares it so
[1:28:32] though though you don't see it though
[1:28:34] you don't feel it though that none of
[1:28:35] the five senses declare it so Revelation
[1:28:38] says it's here it's now it's present and
[1:28:40] so he could be rejoicing thanking God
[1:28:42] that Isaac was on his way because it
[1:28:44] became a revelation amen then he stayed
[1:28:47] in a spiritual atmosphere cuz Sarah had
[1:28:49] to get the same Revelation it's amazing
[1:28:51] before Genesis 18 cuz we're um um as
[1:28:54] family prayer we're reading through
[1:28:55] Genesis chapter night you know praying
[1:28:57] and singing and things and you know um
[1:29:00] but God God tells God tells Abraham
[1:29:03] before Genesis 18 Genesis 18 is when God
[1:29:05] comes down visits Abraham and Sarah you
[1:29:08] know discerns the laughter and Sarah's
[1:29:11] heart and God tells them according to
[1:29:13] time of life you're going to have the
[1:29:14] promised son before that visitation God
[1:29:17] tells Abraham within a year you're going
[1:29:19] to have the child that's right
[1:29:21] hallelujah amen amen so now he had such
[1:29:23] an expectation Lord the clock's ticking
[1:29:27] and you can't lie Hallelujah you can't
[1:29:29] lie Lord why it became such a revelation
[1:29:32] to him so what he do he had a spiritual
[1:29:33] atmosphere around him and no doubt he
[1:29:36] would have seen for 25 years the
[1:29:37] response of Sarah to the promise cuz
[1:29:39] after a while things can get a bit
[1:29:41] redundant when you don't see things
[1:29:42] happening and it can actually become
[1:29:45] annoying let's be honest we're people
[1:29:47] right but then because it anchored in
[1:29:49] his heart he was praising God and
[1:29:52] creating a spiritual atmosphere because
[1:29:53] he knew Lord Lord she's part of the
[1:29:55] promise now she's going to come and
[1:29:56] receive faith that it can be conceived
[1:29:58] in her amen cuz she's part of the promis
[1:30:02] I think if we did that it would be real
[1:30:03] good yeah that's right hallelujah amen
[1:30:07] are having a hard week praise God I'm
[1:30:09] not saying you don't do this but you
[1:30:10] know if we could just focus on the
[1:30:13] promise of God and come in reverently
[1:30:16] before the king amen I think all would
[1:30:19] be well Hallelujah now when God
[1:30:21] manifests himself you see so she Drew
[1:30:23] out she Drew out of king of hazaras
[1:30:25] judgment and
[1:30:28] deliverance amen deliverance from
[1:30:30] herself and her people and judgment upon
[1:30:32] hmon see because within him was to be
[1:30:34] judged but her faith drew that out of
[1:30:37] him now Peter Peter would be fishing one
[1:30:40] day you know it's amazing you know a
[1:30:42] child of God see I just like this Jesus
[1:30:47] says you know they fishing all night
[1:30:49] they weren't catching anything and then
[1:30:51] Jesus said have you caught any fish he
[1:30:53] says now nothing cast your net on the
[1:30:55] other side let down your knet again and
[1:30:57] maybe Peter's thinking what I've tried
[1:30:59] that but something in him said do it he
[1:31:00] says nevertheless at Thy word Lord I do
[1:31:02] it puts his net down the net becomes
[1:31:04] full of fish amen then they pull the
[1:31:06] fish up now other fishermen they were
[1:31:08] looking probably marveling at all the
[1:31:10] fish but you see it brought a response
[1:31:12] out of Peter saying Lord depart from me
[1:31:14] I'm a sinful man Hallelujah so so he got
[1:31:18] he got Mercy because God did a god did
[1:31:21] the miraculous others were maybe
[1:31:23] marveling at fish but he was saying Lord
[1:31:26] depart from me I'm a sinful man I'm not
[1:31:27] worthy to be in your presence Lord so
[1:31:30] his reverence and humility in that
[1:31:32] moment amen brought him
[1:31:35] forgiveness hallelujah amen because he
[1:31:38] went down he went down a sinful man but
[1:31:41] then the Lord said I'm going to make you
[1:31:42] more than that I'm going to make you I'm
[1:31:44] going to make you a fisher of man amen
[1:31:47] cuz why he bowed down with reverence and
[1:31:49] humility and he got Mercy out of God
[1:31:52] hallelujah
[1:31:54] amen amen praise the Lord how are we
[1:31:57] doing for time time's running away now
[1:32:00] Ruth we know the story of Ruth this what
[1:32:04] I'm talking about today I know I've said
[1:32:05] other things but it's the power of
[1:32:07] reverence see you recognize who the
[1:32:08] devil is you know what he is sure he's a
[1:32:11] squatter he's a bluff and all these
[1:32:12] things but he's a real enemy he's more
[1:32:14] than a thought he's a spirit that wants
[1:32:16] to destroy you right you recognize who
[1:32:18] he is you know who God is but then but
[1:32:21] who who are you and your approach to God
[1:32:24] will get what you need out of God Amen
[1:32:26] that's why we can never be blaz when we
[1:32:28] approach the Lord we can't be kiwi how's
[1:32:31] it you know no no no we're going to come
[1:32:33] reverently he's the king of creation
[1:32:35] we're talking about here he's the Lord
[1:32:37] Of Glory that we're
[1:32:38] approaching amen and so Ruth Ruth we
[1:32:41] know in the Book of Ruth she would she
[1:32:43] was a moabitas you know there was there
[1:32:45] was a family that came from Israel they
[1:32:47] came out from bethleem they they they
[1:32:49] went to Moab you know and Ruth married
[1:32:51] one of the sons and but of course you
[1:32:53] know the um Ruth's husband
[1:32:55] brother-in-law and father-in-law they
[1:32:57] all passed away and then Ruth's um
[1:33:00] mother-in-law noomi said look I'm going
[1:33:02] back to Israel now I hear there's grain
[1:33:03] you know the famine is over so so she
[1:33:06] went back Ruth went all the way and said
[1:33:08] I'm following you wherever you go I'll
[1:33:09] go will you die I'll die and all these
[1:33:11] things but then there came a place where
[1:33:14] where where Ruth was was um um she was
[1:33:16] she was gleaning in in boaz's field now
[1:33:19] Boaz we know was a mighty man of wealth
[1:33:22] you know he owned the field that she was
[1:33:23] in and she was a near Kinsman to to
[1:33:26] Naomi and there was a law in the Old
[1:33:29] Testament of the law of the kinsman
[1:33:30] redeemer where where um if someone had
[1:33:33] fallen into debt you know they couldn't
[1:33:35] pay a debt they had to sell themselves
[1:33:36] as a slave or whatever that someone who
[1:33:38] is related to them who had to be a near
[1:33:40] Kinsman they had to be a relation and
[1:33:42] they had to have the money to pay off
[1:33:44] the debt and they had to be willing to
[1:33:45] pay off the debt that so that's the law
[1:33:47] of a Kinsman and if they could do those
[1:33:49] things they could buy their family out
[1:33:50] of slavery restore their restore their
[1:33:53] land now
[1:33:54] Boaz was a near Kinsman to to Naomi and
[1:33:58] Ruth So within him was the ability to
[1:34:02] restore all that Naomi lost right and
[1:34:05] within him by marriage was the ability
[1:34:07] to bring Ruth into the covenants of
[1:34:09] Israel because the law said that no Moab
[1:34:13] no moabit could come into the
[1:34:14] congregation of Israel that's what the
[1:34:16] law said right so the law said Ruth you
[1:34:18] can't come in but Grace overshadowed the
[1:34:20] law and brought and brought Ruth in amen
[1:34:24] so now n me instructed instructed Ruth
[1:34:26] say Ruth Boaz your near Kinsman is going
[1:34:29] to be willowing barley at the threshing
[1:34:32] floor he's going to sleep there go find
[1:34:35] where he lay uncover his feet and lay
[1:34:37] down there and then he will he will tell
[1:34:40] you what to do now go wash yourself put
[1:34:43] on some clean clothes y don't just go
[1:34:44] after you've been in the field all day
[1:34:46] go on with reverence and humility don't
[1:34:48] lay down at his head don't even lay down
[1:34:50] at his side lay down at his feet
[1:34:53] cuz she's going to approach with
[1:34:54] reverence and humility to draw from Boaz
[1:34:58] what she needs right amen so she went
[1:35:01] and lay down there and then and then and
[1:35:04] then at midnight he woke up this is
[1:35:06] verse eight here I'm just power you just
[1:35:07] jumping through this a bit amen and and
[1:35:10] you know he turned and saw that she was
[1:35:11] laying there and he asked the question
[1:35:13] who are you and her her first thing that
[1:35:16] she said is I am Ruth thy handmaid
[1:35:18] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[1:35:20] handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman
[1:35:24] so you're you're related to me through
[1:35:27] Naomi Now cover me with your skirt so
[1:35:30] what I am cover me over that's why
[1:35:33] that's why brother Ram said find where
[1:35:35] our lord Jesus who is Boaz right Bo a
[1:35:38] type of Christ find where he lay where'
[1:35:40] he lay down at Calvary lay down at his
[1:35:43] feet amen because when we come to him at
[1:35:46] Calvary say Lord cover me in your blood
[1:35:48] Hallelujah cover me in myy skirt cover
[1:35:51] my old life cover my first birth yeah
[1:35:54] cuz she's saying look I'm a m but cover
[1:35:56] me with your skirt and why is that
[1:35:57] because you are a near Kinsman to me see
[1:36:00] she didn't come and have Pasley they
[1:36:02] didn't have just a conversation around
[1:36:03] the around the coffee table whatever she
[1:36:05] came in reverence and humility and said
[1:36:08] Lord cover me amen cover my identity
[1:36:11] cover my first birth and then what
[1:36:13] happened is because in him was the
[1:36:15] ability to restore right in him was the
[1:36:19] ability to change her from a moabit to
[1:36:21] an Israelite amen amen in her in him was
[1:36:24] to change her from a widdow with nothing
[1:36:26] to a mighty woman of wealth why because
[1:36:29] she would marry the Mighty Man of wealth
[1:36:31] am mean so now here here she goes she
[1:36:33] does this and then she and then she has
[1:36:35] given six measures of Bley from from
[1:36:38] from Boaz I mean goes back to goes back
[1:36:41] to her her her mother-in-law I'm I'm
[1:36:44] just skipping over some things to save
[1:36:45] time and then and then Noah um Nomi says
[1:36:48] now now I don't have it here but Naomi
[1:36:50] says to Ruth rest now yeah because he
[1:36:53] will not rest until this is all
[1:36:55] fulfilled he will not rest so what
[1:36:57] happened is she going to him caused him
[1:37:01] to act on her behalf so Ruth going to
[1:37:03] Boaz caus him to stand up in his
[1:37:05] position as kinsman redeemer that she
[1:37:07] could be restored now the Bible says
[1:37:09] draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you
[1:37:12] right and it's not just oh I feel close
[1:37:14] to God it's not just that it's Lord I
[1:37:16] have needs you are the answer to all my
[1:37:19] needs Lord there's attributes in you
[1:37:22] that I need to see expressed in in my
[1:37:23] life maybe you don't even know him as
[1:37:26] Savior lay at his feet he'll he'll
[1:37:29] Express that salvation to you maybe you
[1:37:31] don't know him as healer lay at his feet
[1:37:34] he'll Express his healing virtue to you
[1:37:36] maybe you know maybe you don't know him
[1:37:38] as husband his Redeemer lay down on his
[1:37:41] feet he'll redeem you he'll restore you
[1:37:44] he'll make you at one with him like he
[1:37:46] did like Boaz did with
[1:37:49] Ruth
[1:37:50] amen hallelujah
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:55] now what Avail now I'm just going to
[1:37:58] make a quick segue then we're going to
[1:38:01] then we're going to
[1:38:04] stop trust you don't
[1:38:08] mind now the reason the reason that Ruth
[1:38:11] and Esther could go on and do these
[1:38:13] things she they realized that they had
[1:38:16] the not just the ability but it would
[1:38:18] work I believe that you know I I don't
[1:38:20] think Esther went before the king cuz
[1:38:22] she thought I'm just going to see what
[1:38:25] happens she realized she she was
[1:38:27] carrying a secret she was one with him
[1:38:29] right that she could get out of the king
[1:38:31] what she needed what what her people
[1:38:33] needed Ruth was the same way now the
[1:38:35] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:38:37] man availeth much right I just want to
[1:38:40] just emphasize this this is my
[1:38:41] conclusion to this whole matter see we
[1:38:43] come into the presence of God with
[1:38:45] reverence and humility right but we
[1:38:47] realize that our prayers
[1:38:49] Avail he's made us righteous by his
[1:38:52] blood amen our prayers Prayer Changes
[1:38:54] Things amen okay so it availeth much now
[1:38:58] it's interesting this word availeth
[1:39:00] because in the Bible it's only used four
[1:39:02] times and one is used in the Book of
[1:39:03] Esther and it's actually hmon telling
[1:39:06] his wife that oh because because he's
[1:39:08] boasting to his wife I'm the Prime
[1:39:10] Minister I've got all this wealth and
[1:39:12] all these things all my fame but but but
[1:39:14] he says to her but this avails me
[1:39:16] nothing because morai lives that's one
[1:39:19] time this this word's used the other
[1:39:21] times are here the effectual fervent
[1:39:22] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:39:24] but then it's also used in Galatians for
[1:39:26] in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
[1:39:28] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:39:31] Faith which worketh by love now ath
[1:39:34] means it has power it has ability has
[1:39:36] strength right so circumcision or
[1:39:39] uncircumcision that that gives you no
[1:39:41] power or or strength or ability in
[1:39:44] Christ it's faith that worketh by love
[1:39:47] and then he would say in in in chapter
[1:39:48] six for in Christ Jesus neither
[1:39:50] circumcision aileth anything nor
[1:39:52] uncircumcision ision but a new creature
[1:39:56] amen so he's saying the new birth being
[1:39:59] transformed because remember we receive
[1:40:01] the Holy Ghost because we are Sons it
[1:40:03] says in Galatians right so when when God
[1:40:05] gives us his holy spirit we realize who
[1:40:07] our father is right we realize now who
[1:40:10] we are we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:40:13] and then if we if we see those things by
[1:40:15] Revelation then we'll see who the devil
[1:40:16] is cuz the devil once ruled us but now
[1:40:19] we're ordained to rule him when he was
[1:40:21] ruling us he was never meant to in the
[1:40:23] first first place right but but he's but
[1:40:25] Paul is telling the Galatians look it's
[1:40:27] not keeping the law circumcision
[1:40:29] uncircumcision Traditions whatever know
[1:40:31] what avails is that you are a new
[1:40:33] creature what avails or gives you
[1:40:36] strength is faith that works by love
[1:40:39] amen and he says as many as walk
[1:40:41] according to this rule peace be on them
[1:40:43] and mercy and upon the Israel of God
[1:40:46] Amen the Israel what is it the princes
[1:40:48] of God the called out of God am mean so
[1:40:50] me so so if you walk according to this
[1:40:52] rule what's that being a son or daughter
[1:40:55] of God availeth
[1:40:57] much then peace will be upon you I'm his
[1:41:00] child I'm never out of his care he may
[1:41:03] correct me he'll bring me back he'll do
[1:41:04] whatever but I'm his child he can't lose
[1:41:06] me what does that mean you sit back and
[1:41:08] watch the world go by no you press the
[1:41:10] battle amen amen Because Why You Got
[1:41:12] Confidence I'm his child if I'm his
[1:41:14] child I'm part of him he can't lose me I
[1:41:17] am ordained to
[1:41:18] win prise the Lord
[1:41:21] amen praise the Lord
[1:41:24] and then what do you do you find
[1:41:25] yourself identified with the word of God
[1:41:29] Amen I'm just going to finish with these
[1:41:31] two quotes here oh do you find yourself
[1:41:33] identified with as true disciples amen I
[1:41:35] trust you find identified with Ruth and
[1:41:37] Esther amen that's where you want to be
[1:41:39] true to him true to his word stayed up
[1:41:42] in the face of critics I
[1:41:44] mean amen is that where you find
[1:41:46] yourself identified tonight thank the
[1:41:47] Lord amen letting the Life of Christ
[1:41:50] flow through them yes sir they had been
[1:41:52] Sanctified by is coming and a sinful man
[1:41:54] upon confession and sanctification had
[1:41:56] cleansed them and their hearts were so
[1:41:58] centered to God until Christ poured
[1:42:00] himself into them and reflected his
[1:42:02] presence to the world in the face of
[1:42:04] critics they stood like he did they
[1:42:06] stood true to the word even till one
[1:42:08] said thou almost persuade me to be a
[1:42:10] Christian see one of us the critics can
[1:42:12] you identify yourself with Peter on the
[1:42:14] day of Pentecost can you identify
[1:42:16] yourself there in Acts 2 where people
[1:42:18] say today the Holy Ghost was only given
[1:42:20] to the 12 disciples can you identify
[1:42:22] yourself with Peter when he said repent
[1:42:24] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:42:26] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:42:27] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:42:29] gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises
[1:42:31] unto you and to your children them that
[1:42:33] are far off even as many as the Lord Our
[1:42:34] God shall call the same Holy Ghost did
[1:42:36] you identify yourself there with him on
[1:42:39] that day I stand with you Peter yes sir
[1:42:41] upon your fundamental teachings of the
[1:42:43] scripture I stand there I want my life
[1:42:45] to reflect the scripture just like yours
[1:42:47] did there when 3,000 were pricked in
[1:42:51] their
[1:42:52] hearts
[1:42:54] amen I trust you identify yourself in
[1:42:56] the word of
[1:42:58] God praise the
[1:43:00] Lord now in closing I just want to say
[1:43:04] this if you can see yourself if the
[1:43:06] light turns on right when the light
[1:43:08] turns on you see you see the word and
[1:43:12] its truth right you fulfill the word
[1:43:16] it's your everything and you see who God
[1:43:19] is God is his word maybe the musician
[1:43:21] can come right God is his word right so
[1:43:25] when you see he is his word and you want
[1:43:26] to be identified with his word then you
[1:43:29] can see I'm probably saying that too
[1:43:31] much but then you can see who the devil
[1:43:34] really is and then you can withstand
[1:43:39] him so I pray May the light turn on in
[1:43:41] every heart we're going through a very
[1:43:44] murky gray dismal world right there's
[1:43:47] lots of deception lots of trouble all
[1:43:48] these things but God said I'll never
[1:43:50] leave thee nor forsake thee right he
[1:43:52] said I'm a present help in time of
[1:43:54] trouble this is a time of trouble he
[1:43:56] said he said I'm your Shepherd a
[1:43:58] Shepherd doesn't leave a sheep in the
[1:44:01] Bible sense he doesn't leave a sheep
[1:44:02] he's always with them and he leads them
[1:44:05] okay so as long as we stay we say Lord I
[1:44:08] know you're my shepherd you cannot fail
[1:44:10] that's right right if he can't fail and
[1:44:12] if I'm with him then I can't fail no
[1:44:14] matter what the enemy tries to put
[1:44:15] against me am mean my shepherd will
[1:44:17] point out the enemy to me right that I
[1:44:20] can and all I need to do is stay close
[1:44:21] to him and he will
[1:44:24] defeat the enemy
