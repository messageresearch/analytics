[37:26] scripture this morning. Um, we're going
[37:28] to go to Daniel chapter 2 and we're just
[37:31] going to read a couple of verses. Well,
[37:33] few verses here down to verse 45.
[37:45] Okay.
[37:48] Amen to Daniel chapter 2 and we're going
[37:52] to read
[37:54] here from verse 31 to 45. And it and it
[37:59] reads here like this. Says, "Oh, thou
[38:02] king source and behold a great image.
[38:06] This great image whose brightness was
[38:08] excellent stood before thee, and the
[38:10] form thereof was terrible. This image
[38:12] head was of fine gold, his breast and
[38:15] his arms were silver, his belly and
[38:16] thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his
[38:19] feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou
[38:22] sawest till that a stone was cut without
[38:24] hands, which smokeote the image upon his
[38:26] feet, and were of iron and clay, and
[38:28] break them in pieces. To them was the
[38:31] iron, the clay, the brass, the silver,
[38:34] and the gold broke to pieces together
[38:36] and become like the chaff of the summer
[38:37] threshing floors. And the wind carried
[38:39] them away, and that that there was no
[38:41] place found for them. And the stone that
[38:43] smoked the image became a great mountain
[38:46] that filled the whole earth. Amen. And
[38:49] this is the dream. And I'll tell the
[38:51] interpretation thereof before the king.
[38:53] Thou, oh king, art the king of kings,
[38:55] art a king of kings, for the king, for
[38:57] the God of heaven hath given you a
[38:59] kingdom power and strength and glory.
[39:01] And wheresoever the children of men
[39:03] dwell the beasts of the field, and the
[39:04] fowls of heaven hath he given into thine
[39:07] hand, and hath made thee ruler over them
[39:09] all. Thou art this head of gold. And
[39:11] after thee shall arise another kingdom
[39:13] inferior to thee, and and another a
[39:15] third kingdom of brass, which shall bear
[39:17] rule over all the earth. And the fourth
[39:19] kingdom shall be strong as iron. For as
[39:22] much as iron breakth in pieces, and
[39:24] subdueth all things, and as iron that
[39:26] breakth all these shall it break in
[39:28] pieces and bruise. And whereas thou
[39:30] sawest the feet and toes part of
[39:33] potter's clay, part of iron, the kingdom
[39:36] shall be divided, but there shall be in
[39:38] it of the strength um of the strength of
[39:40] the iron. For as much as thou sawest the
[39:42] iron mixed with mary clay. And as the
[39:45] toes of the feet were part of iron, part
[39:47] of clay, so the kingdom shall be strong
[39:49] and partly broken. And whereas thou
[39:51] sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they
[39:53] shall mingle themselves with the seed of
[39:55] men, and they shall not cleave one to
[39:56] another, even as iron is not mixed with
[39:58] clay. And in the days of these kings
[40:02] shall God shall the God of heaven set up
[40:04] a kingdom which shall never be
[40:05] destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be
[40:07] left to another people. It shall break
[40:09] in pieces and consume all these
[40:11] kingdoms, and shall stand forever. For
[40:13] as much as our sorest at the stone was
[40:15] cut out of the mountain without hands,
[40:17] and it break in pieces the iron and the
[40:19] brass and the clay, the silver and gold,
[40:22] the great God hath made known to the
[40:24] king what shall come to pass hereafter.
[40:26] And the dream is certain and the
[40:28] interpretation thereof sure. Amen. And
[40:31] just a bit of a context, you don't need
[40:32] to turn to it. We'll just read it here
[40:34] in John uh 17. This is the Lord
[40:37] speaking. He says, "I've given them thy
[40:38] word, and the world hath hated them
[40:41] because they are not of the world, even
[40:42] as I am not of the world. I pray not
[40:45] that thou shouldest take them out of the
[40:47] world, but that thou should us keep them
[40:49] from the evil. They are not of the
[40:51] world, even as I am not of the world.
[40:53] Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy
[40:55] word is truth. As thou hast sent me into
[40:58] the world, even so have I also sent them
[41:00] into the world." Amen. bit of a I pray
[41:04] it'll make sense and come together as we
[41:06] go along. But let's just bow our heads
[41:07] in a word of prayer this morning, shall
[41:08] we? Amen. Let's dedicate our lives to
[41:10] the Lord. Oh gracious Lord Jesus. We are
[41:12] so glad Lord we can just throw up our
[41:14] hands and praise you again and again
[41:16] Lord for what you've done Lord. Your

[41:46] especially Rick Father especially dear

[41:56] mighty God you're the mighty healer and
[41:58] we thank you Lord we can commit every
[41:59] case into your hands nothing too
[42:01] difficult for you. And father, as we've
[42:03] read your word, we now ask you to come
[42:05] and bless it, anoint it to our hearts.
[42:07] May have your way in our midst, Lord,
[42:08] for your glory in Jesus Christ's name.
[42:10] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Friends, you
[42:13] can all have your seats this morning.
[42:14] So, I want to speak about this if I
[42:16] could use it as a title. We are they are
[42:18] of the world even as I am not of the
[42:20] world. So, what we read there in in um
[42:23] Daniel chapter 2 is Nebuchadnezzar, the
[42:25] king of Babylon, he had a dream when he
[42:28] saw a statue much like this. this image
[42:30] and he was had no idea what it meant.
[42:33] Then of course God gave Daniel the
[42:34] interpretation and he showed him that
[42:36] this is the world powers until the time
[42:38] of the end. So this is the anointing on
[42:40] the world system. Now I just want to if
[42:43] you get nothing out of this uh apart
[42:45] from this one thing that' be real good.
[42:47] We are not called to be part of that
[42:48] image. Right? The anointing that
[42:50] controls this world a Christian is no
[42:53] part of it. It's not the same spirit as
[42:55] the Holy Ghost. It's a very different
[42:56] spirit. It's not of God. Amen. But God
[42:59] has allowed it to rule the world until
[43:00] the time of the end. Okay? So that's
[43:03] really if that's all you get, well
[43:04] that's fine because that's really I pray
[43:06] that God would would would cause you if
[43:09] you're not already to be part of that
[43:10] stone cut without the mountain, you
[43:12] know, made without hands. Cut without
[43:14] hands, right? Because that's Christ
[43:15] himself coming to establish his kingdom.
[43:18] So as we read, I'm just going to go
[43:19] through I really want to focus on the
[43:21] feet and the, you know, the legs and the
[43:22] feet today. Um but just just very
[43:24] quickly we read that you know uh
[43:26] Nebuchadnezzar was told that he is the
[43:28] head of gold. That's his kingdom. And
[43:30] then that kingdom passes down from the
[43:33] from the Babylonians until until it
[43:36] comes to I think it's Nebuchadnezzar's
[43:37] grandson. I might be wrong. Um but
[43:39] Belshazar has a big feast and he's
[43:41] having a big banquet of wine and the
[43:44] kingdom's falling apart but he you know
[43:45] and and you know the final final push
[43:48] for this for the for the um you know the
[43:50] the head of gold of you know if I put it
[43:52] that way that kingdom to change to the
[43:53] Mes and Persians is when he takes the
[43:56] vessels of the temple of God that you
[43:58] know they had taken from Jerusalem and
[43:59] they use it for a banquet just to you
[44:01] know as a mockery and then you know
[44:03] there's a written god you know a big
[44:04] hand of God comes and write on the wall
[44:06] many men many tickle you fastened if you
[44:09] in English that way. And you know,
[44:10] there's all the shock and trouble and
[44:11] all these things. And then Daniel's been
[44:14] forgotten by this stage, but the mother
[44:15] of um Belshazar says, "Go get Daniel."
[44:18] He was a wise man. He was a counselor
[44:20] for your for your father, I think,
[44:22] grandfather. And you know, then he comes
[44:23] in and God gives him the interpretation
[44:25] of what this handwriting on the wall
[44:27] means. And he says basically that your
[44:29] kingdom, you've been found in the
[44:30] balance and found wanting. And you know,
[44:33] your kingdom is now divided. It's given
[44:34] to the Mes and Persians. And even that
[44:36] same night, Amen. Darius the which is
[44:39] the median which is the me took the
[44:40] kingdom you know he killed Belshazar he
[44:42] took the kingdom so there was a transfer
[44:44] from this from this head of gold to now
[44:47] into this kingdom of uh silver okay so
[44:51] I'm just bringing this into real world
[44:53] events okay to show you this is not
[44:55] something that's just been hatched out
[44:56] of nowhere these things were written
[44:58] before it happened right and then it's
[45:00] still very much uh going on today I mean
[45:04] the Bible is not just a story book it's
[45:06] not a book of morals or ethics it's a
[45:07] book prophecy. Amen. And God wants you
[45:09] to know where you are that where you are
[45:11] in the book, you'll see what the enemy
[45:13] is doing and you'll say, "I want no part
[45:15] of that guy." Doesn't matter how
[45:16] appealing it is. Don't matter how how it
[45:18] may pull at your emotions, whatever
[45:20] more. We're in this world, but not of
[45:22] the world. We've been called out by a
[45:24] prophetic message. Come out of her, my
[45:25] people. Amen. So, now the kingdom's now
[45:28] given. It's to the Mes and Persians,
[45:30] which is the um uh you breast there, the
[45:33] you know, the arms and so on of you of
[45:35] silver. And then Daniel sees the same
[45:37] image. Now, in the right hand side of
[45:39] this picture, you can see there's like
[45:40] there's these different um animals, you
[45:43] could say. And it's because Daniel saw
[45:45] the same image, but but as as as beast
[45:48] anointings. And so each each of these
[45:50] anointings, you can go read it. We don't
[45:52] uh we don't really have time to read the
[45:53] whole thing, but you can go read that in
[45:55] uh Daniel chapter 7, also chapter 8,
[45:58] where where he's showing that the
[46:00] anointings on these kingdoms are
[46:01] represented by these different animals,
[46:03] these different beasts. And then finally
[46:05] it comes now where Daniel saw where he
[46:07] says and I was lifted up mine eyes and
[46:09] saw and behold there stood before a
[46:11] river a ram which had two horns and the
[46:13] two horns were high but one was higher
[46:15] than the other and the higher came up
[46:18] last. I saw the ram pushing westward and
[46:20] northward and southward so that no beast
[46:23] might stand before him. Neither was
[46:24] there any that could deliver out of his
[46:26] hand but he did according to his will
[46:28] and became great. Now that's the kingdom
[46:30] of the Mes and Persians right there.
[46:31] Okay, that ram. And then as I was
[46:33] considering, behold, uh, and hegoat came
[46:36] from the west, and on the face of the
[46:38] whole earth, um, and touched not the
[46:41] ground. And the goat had a notable horn
[46:43] between his eyes. And he came to the ram
[46:45] that had two horns, which I had seen
[46:47] standing before the river, and ran unto
[46:49] him in the fury of his power. And I saw
[46:51] him come close unto the ram, and he
[46:53] moved with a collar against him, and
[46:55] smoked the ram, and break his two horns.
[46:57] And there was no power in the ram to
[46:59] stand before him, but he was cast down
[47:01] to the ground and stamped upon him. And
[47:03] there was none that could deliver the
[47:04] ram out of his hand. Now the uh uh horn
[47:07] here represents a power. Okay. So now
[47:09] this now this he goat that came from the
[47:11] west, this actually speaks of Alexander
[47:13] the Great, the king of the Greeks. He's
[47:15] coming from the west and uh so so he
[47:17] invades history. It says he invades the
[47:19] Persian Empire. And it's amazing when
[47:21] you look at the when you look at the uh
[47:24] you know because that last verse says
[47:25] and none could deliver the ram out of
[47:27] his hands and none could deliver the me
[47:29] and Persians out of the hand of
[47:31] Alexander the great the Greeks and
[47:32] Macedonians there and it's amazing when
[47:34] you look at history because by the size
[47:37] of the different empires you think the
[47:38] Persian Empire could have swallowed up
[47:40] the Greeks real easy. Look at this. Now
[47:42] the area of the um Persian Empire under
[47:44] Darius III which was the one who
[47:46] Alexander fought against was 5.5 million
[47:50] square kilometers. That's how big the
[47:51] territory was. It it went from Egypt I
[47:54] mean all the way into the Indis Valley
[47:55] and you know you know in uh India there
[47:57] Punjab area we call it now. It had the
[47:59] population of 50 million people. Think
[48:01] about this. This is this is what
[48:03] Alexander is attacking. But the kingdom
[48:05] of Alexander, which is Macedonia and its
[48:07] Greek allies at that same time, was
[48:10] roughly 500,000 square kilometers
[48:14] and it had roughly a population of 3 to
[48:17] 5 million people. You think, how on
[48:19] earth could a country that's so small
[48:22] invade a country that's so big? Well,
[48:24] the very reason is is because prophecy
[48:26] said before it ever happened that none
[48:28] could deliver the um um the ram out of
[48:30] his hand. So there was nothing that
[48:32] could stop prophecy being fulfilled. It
[48:35] didn't matter how great the Persian
[48:36] Empire was. It didn't matter how great
[48:38] Amen. You know his armies and its
[48:40] strength and its wealth. That had
[48:42] nothing to do with it. It had to fall to
[48:43] the feet of Alexander. And it did. Amen.
[48:46] It did very powerfully. Amen. They had
[48:48] two very powerful battles where the
[48:50] Greeks were heavily outnumbered. But
[48:51] they they they dealt with him. Why?
[48:53] Because they were walking in prophecy
[48:55] though they did not realize it. And it
[48:57] goes to show that there is nothing that
[49:00] can stop the wheels of prophecy turning.
[49:02] Amen. There is nothing that can stop it.
[49:04] I've got a couple here I just want to
[49:05] shout about today. Amen. Where it says
[49:07] that he might present himself a a a
[49:09] spotless bride, a glorious church
[49:11] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[49:13] thing. Amen. I tell you what, friends,
[49:15] there's nothing that can stop that
[49:16] scripture becoming flesh. Amen. There's
[49:19] nothing that stop that prophecy becoming
[49:21] fulfilled. It doesn't matter how dark
[49:22] this world gets. Doesn't matter how evil
[49:24] it gets. Doesn't matter how much
[49:26] unbelief is in the world. That will not
[49:28] stop this word being fulfilled.
[49:30] Hallelujah. It says in Revelations 19,
[49:32] "Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[49:34] honor to him. For the marriage of the
[49:36] lamb has come and his wife has made
[49:37] herself ready and to her was granted she
[49:40] should be arrayed in the in fine linen
[49:42] clean and white. For the fine linen is
[49:44] the righteousness of saints." I tell you
[49:46] what, friends, fine linen, the
[49:47] righteousness of saints has been given
[49:48] out in this generation. Amen. By the
[49:50] message of the hour, the the fine linen,
[49:52] the righteousness has been has been
[49:53] preached has been given. Amen. That we'd
[49:55] be a raid and fine linen. Amen. The
[49:57] righteousness of saints. Nothing can
[49:59] stop it happening. Nothing can stop it
[50:01] happening. Doesn't matter what scheme
[50:03] the devil tries to form against you. No
[50:05] weapon formed against you shall prosper.
[50:07] Amen. If you're part of the bride of
[50:08] Jesus Christ, nothing will prosper
[50:10] against you. But it will fall under your
[50:12] feet. Amen. Why? Because prophecy must
[50:15] be fulfilled. It doesn't matter how
[50:16] great the schemes of man are, how the
[50:18] devil's plans, and all of his ideas he's
[50:21] got. Nothing can stop prophecy being
[50:23] fulfilled. Hallelujah. Amen. Here's
[50:25] another one. Behold, I show you a
[50:26] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[50:29] shall all be changed. Amen. God's going
[50:31] to change these bodies. Hallelujah.
[50:33] Amen. There will be a translation of the
[50:37] bride, the dead and living in Christ.
[50:38] Amen. Nothing can stop it. Nothing's
[50:41] going to stop it. Amen. The devil's
[50:43] thrown everything he has at it and he
[50:45] couldn't stop it. Isn't it amazing? You
[50:47] think that you our enemy has given his
[50:49] best punch. He gave his best punch
[50:51] against our Lord Jesus Christ. couldn't
[50:53] stop him. Amen. Religion couldn't stop
[50:55] him. Culture couldn't stop him. Unbelief
[50:57] couldn't stop him. Whatever name they
[50:59] put upon the Lord Jesus Christ, being a
[51:01] illegitimate child, all these things,
[51:03] nothing could stop him. The grave
[51:04] couldn't stop him. The Roman power
[51:06] couldn't stop him. Kyifers couldn't stop
[51:08] him. Nothing could stop him. Why?
[51:10] Because it was prophesied. I lay my life
[51:12] down. I'm going to pick it up again.
[51:14] Hallelujah. I'm going to be a ransom for
[51:16] the for the world. I mean, I'm going to
[51:17] purchase the salvation of my people.
[51:19] Nothing can stop them. Nothing can stop
[51:21] you either. Amen. If the devil could
[51:23] have stopped you, he would have done it
[51:25] a long time ago, but he couldn't stop
[51:26] you. Amen. You're still here walking
[51:28] with the Lord. Who's with me this
[51:29] morning? Amen. God is present among us.
[51:31] Amen. And he is determined. I'm going to
[51:33] make you in my image. Amen. It doesn't
[51:35] matter what you come out of. Doesn't
[51:36] matter what you've been through. Amen.
[51:38] There's nothing too hard for the Lord.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop him.
[51:43] Praise the Lord. Amen. The ram. Now, now
[51:47] this is after. So this is after the so
[51:49] now we're in the um kingdom of if I just
[51:50] go back to my picture quickly now we've
[51:52] gone in from the me and Persians now now
[51:54] Alexander the Grecian empire has taken
[51:56] over but then even even the
[51:59] fragmentation of this was prophesied
[52:01] because Alexander he died at 30
[52:03] something years old and hadn't really
[52:05] established uh the kingdom properly and
[52:08] you know he dies as a drunk or whatever
[52:10] happened to him and then the kingdom is
[52:12] divided between his four generals it
[52:15] says the ram which thou saw having two
[52:17] horns is the kings of Media and Persia.
[52:19] This is the continuing what we read
[52:20] before. And the rough goat is the king
[52:22] of Grecia, king of Greece. And the great
[52:25] horn that is between his eyes is the
[52:27] first king who made the empire.
[52:30] Alexander made the empire. Amen. Now
[52:32] that being broken, whereas four stood up
[52:34] for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out
[52:36] of the nation, but not in his power. You
[52:39] go read world history, Alexander's
[52:41] empire split into four.
[52:45] And then what happened after that? The
[52:47] Romans took it. Right? Now we go into
[52:50] the into the feet uh into the legs into
[52:53] the iron. Right? Now it says, "Now this
[52:55] fourth kingdom shall be strong." Make
[52:58] sure I haven't missed anything here.
[53:00] This fourth kingdom shall be strong as
[53:02] iron. For as much as iron breakth in
[53:04] pieces, and subdueth all things, and is
[53:07] iron that breakth all all these, it
[53:09] shall break in pieces and bruise. Amen.
[53:12] So it's going to subdue all. This spirit
[53:14] now is not just in the Rome in the
[53:16] European area. This has gone around the
[53:18] world. This spirit has gone around the
[53:20] world and it's subdued and broken all
[53:22] things into pieces. This is why the
[53:25] world is in such a disaster as in today.
[53:27] Cuz the spirit has gone into the world.
[53:30] It's gone into it's gone into the
[53:32] Americas. What did it do? Broke into
[53:34] pieces. Gone into Africa. What's it
[53:35] done? Broken it all into pieces. It's
[53:37] come down into our lives. You know,
[53:40] isn't it amazing? There's a big argument
[53:42] this day. who should use what bathroom.
[53:47] People don't know who men are anymore
[53:48] and men don't know who men are and women
[53:50] don't know who women should be and all
[53:51] these things. There's a big there's a
[53:53] big confusion. Why is that? Cuz this
[53:54] spirit has come down and broken down the
[53:56] family structure. It's broken down what
[53:58] men should be. You know, I think
[54:00] nowadays, especially in this country,
[54:02] it's just been boiled down to the only
[54:04] difference between a man and a woman is
[54:05] at the moment it's only the woman that
[54:07] can give birth.
[54:09] Really, they people say, "Oh, their
[54:10] spirits are basically the same. They're
[54:12] all all exactly the same. Why? Because
[54:15] the spirit has come down and subdued and
[54:16] broken everything into pieces.
[54:19] But the Bible tells us what abandoned
[54:21] woman should be.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; We're of different spirits. One's
[54:24] feminine, one's masculine, right? We're
[54:26] built differently. God made us
[54:28] differently. But you see, this thing has
[54:30] come down and broken broken these
[54:32] things. Broken and bruised. A mean
[54:34] subdued all things.
[54:36] But then it came to a point where that
[54:38] kingdom became it says here and where is
[54:40] thou source the feet and toes part of
[54:42] the potter's clan part of iron the
[54:43] kingdom shall be divided. So went from
[54:45] the Roman Empire then that thing split
[54:47] into the east and west and then the
[54:49] Catholic church it says in revelations
[54:50] 13 it says that that beast which is this
[54:53] last kingdom it shall have a deadly
[54:55] wound that is healed. So what happened
[54:56] is it went from pagan Rome to paple
[54:59] Roman power and you look through even in
[55:01] today I thought it was amazing there's
[55:03] so many world leaders that still go to
[55:05] the Vatican to see the pope doesn't
[55:07] matter if they're Catholic not
[55:08] indifferent atheist whatever more it's
[55:10] strange why do they go see this guy
[55:13] &gt;&gt; why do they go have an audience why
[55:14] because that spirit is still ruling over
[55:16] the world it still has dominion you know
[55:19] it still has a big draw card silio when
[55:21] he says something the world listens
[55:24] &gt;&gt; why because that kingdom is still ruling
[55:27] because remember this thing is religious
[55:29] and political right you go look at the
[55:32] you know history of Europe and so on
[55:34] there was the king and there was the
[55:35] cardinal governing the what the king
[55:37] should do it was it's always a religious
[55:40] political thing and this is where you
[55:41] got to if you're caught up in religious
[55:43] politics in this day you're stuck in
[55:45] this system I'm going to drop it in
[55:47] right now if you're caught up in the
[55:48] religious political things going on in
[55:50] the world you're in this spirit you got
[55:52] to come out amen that thing won't help
[55:55] you won't give you real revival. It
[55:57] won't give you joy. It won't give you
[55:58] peace. It won't give you overcoming
[56:00] power. But you'll just be broken up into
[56:02] pieces when the stone comes to break
[56:04] this thing down. But we're called not to
[56:06] be part of this system. We're called to
[56:08] be part of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[56:11] Amen. So what did it do? It became now
[56:13] became it came um separated this way
[56:18] and then it's come down now. So, so
[56:20] there was the east west also schism in
[56:22] the Catholic church you know became
[56:24] orthodox in the east and then the Roman
[56:26] one in the west it came down these two
[56:28] powers came down but then it didn't stay
[56:31] there because what it mixed even more
[56:32] now let's just read the bit of it uh
[56:34] let's just keep going here I feel like
[56:36] I'm running too fast let's try and slow
[56:38] down after this I saw in the night
[56:40] visions behold a fourth beast dreadful
[56:42] and terrible and exceed and strong
[56:44] exceeding this is the same thing just as
[56:46] a beast power that that Daniel saw okay
[56:49] um He's seeing the same things, but
[56:50] instead of the feet and the iron and
[56:52] clay and only seeing it as an aby beast
[56:54] anointing. And after this, I saw in the
[56:56] night visions, behold, a fourth beast,
[56:57] dreadful and terrible, and strong
[57:00] exceedingly, and it had great iron
[57:02] teeth, and it devoured and break in
[57:03] pieces, and stamped the residue with the
[57:05] feet of it, and it was diverse from all
[57:07] the beasts that was before it, and it
[57:09] had 10 horns. So this thing it's it
[57:12] devours as I read before in there in um
[57:14] you know the previous chapter there you
[57:16] know it has all these different so it
[57:19] breaks down the family it breaks down
[57:20] what men and women should be it breaks
[57:22] down what children should be you know it
[57:24] breaks down the it's all being this
[57:26] world has been chewed up economically
[57:29] the world is broken why is that because
[57:31] this power's come in like if you look at
[57:33] the majority the vast majority of
[57:35] Catholic nations are poor
[57:38] why because they give all they have to
[57:40] try and pray their, you know, get, you
[57:42] know, their penance and they give all
[57:44] the money to the church to try and make
[57:46] a big beautiful church that they think
[57:47] it'll help them in the, you know, to get
[57:49] to the next world. All these things
[57:51] like, you know, Brother Bram says, you
[57:52] know, little little Pedro there in, you
[57:54] know, Mexico, he earns 50 pesos a week
[57:57] or whatever more. He's got a family of
[57:58] six, but he gives 45 of those pesos to
[58:01] the church to make some put some candle
[58:03] on the altar to to to try and get him
[58:05] some brownie points with God, basically.
[58:08] and and the place is poor and broken.
[58:11] Why? Because the spirit has come in and
[58:12] has broken it to pieces. And you see any
[58:15] place where the where this Roman spirit
[58:17] has come into power, the country becomes
[58:19] poor.
[58:20] And this is you can see it very much in
[58:22] America today. It was prophesied the
[58:24] thing would be broken, be busted, and
[58:26] it's very much that way. Why? Because
[58:28] the Roman power has come uh into
[58:31] manifestation. And it's been there for a
[58:33] long time, folks. It hasn't just turned
[58:35] up the other day. It's been there for a
[58:36] long time. Amen. And so, you know, even
[58:39] brother Brandham would say about, you
[58:40] know, when Kennedy was elected the first
[58:41] Catholic president, he said, "There's
[58:43] Ahab and the Jezebel system behind him."
[58:46] Amen. These things are happening in
[58:48] front of us. We got to be very sober in
[58:50] this day. Don't be caught up in what's
[58:51] going on. Amen. No, stay with the word
[58:54] of God.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; And then, so now it's part iron and part
[58:59] clay.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; So, so, so it's it's mixed. It doesn't
[59:03] have strength. It can't bond together.
[59:05] And it brings a very divided society,
[59:07] you know. So, it's Romanism and
[59:09] Protestantism.
[59:10] That's what it started out as. And then
[59:12] they became the liberal and the
[59:14] conservatives. You know, you see
[59:15] America, they'll never have a union once
[59:18] again. They're on their way to
[59:19] destruction. I hate to say it because I
[59:21] love this world. I love I want to see
[59:23] people free and walking with God. But
[59:25] that kind of spirit has come in. It's
[59:26] going to destroy this world. This world
[59:28] is so fractured. Even in this even in
[59:30] this country, we can't even have a talk
[59:32] about the treaty. We can't even have a
[59:34] decent discussion about anything because
[59:36] it's so polarized.
[59:38] Why? Because it's iron and clay. It
[59:40] can't mix. The spirit has come into all
[59:42] the world. You say, "Well, we're not
[59:44] even a Christian country anymore." It
[59:45] doesn't matter. That spirit is here and
[59:47] it's divided the world. It's broken this
[59:49] country. I mean, it's broken. It's
[59:51] broken the West. It's broken many
[59:52] countries in the world. Why? Because
[59:54] there's these always these things that
[59:55] can't mix in every country. I mean, the
[59:58] liberal and the conservative, do you
[59:59] think they can ever have an agreement?
[1:00:01] Do you think they can ever lay down
[1:00:02] their things if they realize they're
[1:00:04] wrong and come to the middle ground
[1:00:05] somewhere? No. They can't do it. They
[1:00:07] won't do it. The word says it won't
[1:00:08] happen. Why? Because it's iron and clay.
[1:00:11] I mean, the socialists and the
[1:00:12] capitalists, you know, the socialism
[1:00:13] actually birthe um communism. That's
[1:00:16] where it came out of. And people today
[1:00:18] are so caught up about, oh, there's a
[1:00:20] socialist agenda and communistic ideas
[1:00:22] coming in. Don't get caught up in that
[1:00:24] stuff. The Bible never said that
[1:00:27] communism would rule the world. He never
[1:00:29] said that socialism would rule the
[1:00:30] world. It's Romanism that will rule the
[1:00:32] world. I mean, it's got nothing to do
[1:00:34] with it. It's not even a pebble on the
[1:00:36] beach. Brother Bram said, God has
[1:00:39] allowed it to rise up to bring judgment
[1:00:40] on a world that's rejected the gospel.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about the social
[1:00:44] gospel that people fill churches and not
[1:00:46] transformed by the Holy Ghost. I'm not
[1:00:48] talking about that gospel. I'm talking
[1:00:49] about a real fire of God changing
[1:00:52] people's lives. Amen. That they live
[1:00:54] according to the word because God's
[1:00:55] changed their spirit. Don't don't ch up
[1:00:57] on me. This may be a bit heavy, but I
[1:00:59] just want you to realize we're not of
[1:01:00] this world. Amen. We have a heart for
[1:01:02] this world. We love everybody. Want to
[1:01:04] see everyone free. We don't people
[1:01:05] caught up in this great trap. Amen. I
[1:01:08] tell you, don't be caught up in these
[1:01:09] things in this day.
[1:01:11] Amen. The socialist and the capitalist,
[1:01:13] the atheist and the theist, someone who
[1:01:15] believes in God. All these things, it's
[1:01:17] iron and clay mixing together.
[1:01:20] Well, it won't mix together. It just
[1:01:21] gets pushed together, but it won't
[1:01:23] actually be fused together. So, there's
[1:01:24] no strength. It's just iron and clay
[1:01:26] that's gone through the whole world.
[1:01:28] I'm sure we can see this, right? And
[1:01:30] it's mixing. It's trying to break each
[1:01:32] other's power, but it'll never do it.
[1:01:35] It'll it'll just stay this way. And it
[1:01:37] stays this way all the way to the end.
[1:01:39] This is why this this is why this world
[1:01:41] is divided today. You cannot fix it. You
[1:01:45] cannot say, "Well, we're just going to
[1:01:46] make the you know, you you know, the
[1:01:49] thing that scares me more than Yeah.
[1:01:51] Because brother said, don't worry about
[1:01:52] the communists. At least you know what
[1:01:53] they are." You know, he said, "I'd
[1:01:55] rather be under that kind of government
[1:01:57] than a than a Christian government
[1:01:59] because a Christian government is the
[1:02:01] most dangerous one because it will
[1:02:03] enforce upon you." Amen. What they
[1:02:05] believe you should believe.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, look at the Catholics with the
[1:02:09] Inquisition. Look at it through history.
[1:02:11] That spirit is still alive. It hasn't
[1:02:13] gone anywhere. Amen. But there's always
[1:02:15] been an enforcing. So when I see a
[1:02:17] country that says, "Oh, now we've become
[1:02:18] a Christian country." What will that
[1:02:20] mean? You got to believe in a three God
[1:02:22] trinity. Baptize in the name of Father,
[1:02:24] Son, and Holy Ghost. You got to be
[1:02:26] joined to the World Council of Churches.
[1:02:27] It's just a binding to stop the spirit
[1:02:29] of God flowing. It's a dangerous thing.
[1:02:32] Amen. Oh, but it looks so good. It's
[1:02:34] actually not good. Like brother I mean I
[1:02:36] mean brother Isaac preached years ago,
[1:02:38] the right will appear to be the good
[1:02:40] ones and they'll win, but they're not
[1:02:41] the good ones. There's no good one. It's
[1:02:43] only the word of God is the good one.
[1:02:45] They're both baddies. Why? Cuz they're
[1:02:48] against the word. Oh, we're going to
[1:02:50] rally for the goodies. Well, rally for
[1:02:51] the word. Don't rally for some political
[1:02:53] movement. Amen. Politics is rotten.
[1:02:56] Amen. If something starts to rot, you it
[1:02:59] needs a resurrection. That's the only
[1:03:01] way a new life needs to come in it. And
[1:03:03] you cannot put new life into politics.
[1:03:05] The only thing that will ever happen is
[1:03:07] when God gives you the real new birth.
[1:03:10] Amen. You'll be out of that stuff as
[1:03:12] fast as you can run.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's with me this morning? I
[1:03:16] trust this is okay. I just want to pour
[1:03:18] what's on my soul because it's such a
[1:03:20] big danger in this day. Amen. If your
[1:03:23] life is just fixated on Charlie Kirk and
[1:03:25] videos of what he's doing or done. Amen.
[1:03:27] You need to change your diet. Amen. It's
[1:03:29] interesting, sure, to hear it to see his
[1:03:31] arguments and people's viewpoints,
[1:03:32] that's all fine. But if that's your
[1:03:34] spiritual walk, you need to change your
[1:03:36] walk. Amen. If you're caught up in
[1:03:37] trying to make the politics towards the
[1:03:39] right, I tell you, actually forget the
[1:03:41] thing. Cuz God never said that that will
[1:03:44] help anybody. You say, "Oh, it's all
[1:03:45] these conspiracies and troubles and
[1:03:47] things." Friends, if you just heard the
[1:03:49] word of God, you won't be caught up in
[1:03:51] any of that stuff. Amen. It's like I
[1:03:53] said a few weeks ago about the Jews
[1:03:55] there. You know, we're living in the day
[1:03:57] where the pattern between between the
[1:04:00] start of the book of Acts and the
[1:04:01] destruction of Jerusalem. We're living
[1:04:03] in that day. Go read the history of the
[1:04:05] siege of Jerusalem. Go read about it.
[1:04:07] read about the different Jewish
[1:04:08] political factions and religious
[1:04:10] factions that were trying to come
[1:04:12] together to make Israel great again. And
[1:04:14] they couldn't do it because you know
[1:04:16] why? Because the Messiah they rejected
[1:04:18] stood there when he saw the temple. He
[1:04:20] said, "Not one stone will be left upon
[1:04:22] another of this temple." And he said,
[1:04:24] "You better pray when this happens that
[1:04:26] there's it's not on the Sabbath or on a
[1:04:27] snowy day." He says, "As soon as you see
[1:04:29] that enemy come around, you better flee
[1:04:31] for the hills." And you know what the
[1:04:33] believers did when they saw Titus come
[1:04:35] with his with his armies? What do they
[1:04:37] do? They remember the word of their
[1:04:38] Messiah. Amen. And they fled that place.
[1:04:40] And history says not one Christian was
[1:04:43] caught in that that destruction. But all
[1:04:45] those ones who are caught up in the
[1:04:46] religious political revival of the day,
[1:04:48] they were destroyed.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; We are in that same place today
[1:04:54] globally.
[1:04:57] It's it's just how it is. There's a
[1:04:59] there's a tribulation coming. Amen.
[1:05:01] Don't be part of it. Whatever you do,
[1:05:03] you don't need to be caught up in that
[1:05:05] thing. No, we have an exit door of a
[1:05:07] rapture. Amen. To walk through by the
[1:05:09] grace of almighty God.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] Amen. You know, especially in brother
[1:05:16] Bram's day, it was the day of the Cuban
[1:05:18] Missile Crisis and the and the Cold War
[1:05:20] and you know, there was the Iron Curtain
[1:05:22] and all these things. And so, everyone
[1:05:24] was all the preachers were crowing on
[1:05:26] about communism. He said repeatedly
[1:05:28] through his message, he says, "Listen,
[1:05:30] it's all right. Just a minute longer.
[1:05:32] Listen, what are you scared of
[1:05:33] communism? What are you afraid of
[1:05:35] communism for? You people wake up.
[1:05:37] Communism is in God's hand. Why? It's a
[1:05:39] tool he's using to bring judgment
[1:05:42] against a god-rejecting world. Brother
[1:05:45] Ram said, you know, Isusa Street, that
[1:05:46] Pentecostal revival actually started in
[1:05:48] in in Russia. They had it before it went
[1:05:51] to Isusa Street. Do you know that? Who
[1:05:52] knows that they had a Pentecostal
[1:05:55] outpouring in that place, but they
[1:05:57] rejected it. So God rose up communism as
[1:06:00] judgment because they rejected the move
[1:06:02] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:04] And what has the world come to today?
[1:06:07] Oh, don't shout. Don't get too happy.
[1:06:10] Don't get lost in the spirit. Don't fall
[1:06:12] in love with God. You got to act
[1:06:13] sensible. No. The only sensible act is
[1:06:16] when God takes control and he does what
[1:06:18] he wants to do. That's the only sensible
[1:06:19] move you could ever do. Is when you
[1:06:21] surrender your life and let the Holy
[1:06:22] Ghost get you and do what he wants to do
[1:06:24] through you. That's the only sensible
[1:06:26] thing. He said, "It's not one scripture
[1:06:28] in the Bible that said communism will
[1:06:30] rule the world, but the Bible said
[1:06:32] Romanism will rule the world." People
[1:06:34] are so worried about China and what
[1:06:36] they're doing. Don't worry about it.
[1:06:38] It's risen up for a purpose, right? But
[1:06:41] they won't rule the world. Russia ain't
[1:06:44] going to rule the world. Can't you see
[1:06:45] why they're grinding on in the Ukraine?
[1:06:47] To me, it's because God's holding it
[1:06:49] back because he wants to get our
[1:06:50] attention. The tribulation's coming. All
[1:06:53] this pressure and trouble and strife is
[1:06:55] ramping up around the world. There's
[1:06:57] different factions of problems going on
[1:06:59] everywhere. That's why there's all these
[1:07:01] unresolved historical issues globally
[1:07:03] have come to the surface in this day
[1:07:05] because there's going to be enough anger
[1:07:07] and aggression that when the tribulation
[1:07:09] actually when God's people leave the
[1:07:10] earth, the Holy Ghost lifts off the
[1:07:12] Gentiles. Then there's nothing to hold
[1:07:14] back that hatred.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; You know, World War II was an amateur
[1:07:18] tribulation. Yes.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen footage of what
[1:07:21] happened to Berlin? What happened to
[1:07:23] London in the blitz? What happened to
[1:07:25] those cities that were just You ever see
[1:07:27] what Do you know why there's all Now,
[1:07:29] you probably ever asked this, but you
[1:07:30] know in Japan there's all these cherry
[1:07:32] blossom gardens. Do you know why those
[1:07:35] are there? Because under those things
[1:07:37] apparently is where all the dead are
[1:07:39] buried from the fire bombing that
[1:07:41] happened in Japan. You know the b you
[1:07:43] know why those two bombs were dropped in
[1:07:45] Hiroshima, you know, Nagasaki and
[1:07:47] Hiroshima. Those are the Hiroshima or
[1:07:49] wherever they are bombed. Do you know
[1:07:50] why those two two cities were picked?
[1:07:52] Cuz most of the other ones were
[1:07:53] firebombed because most of those cities
[1:07:56] of Japan were made out of wood. So they
[1:07:58] made incendiary bombs the Americans did
[1:08:00] and they just firebombed the place.
[1:08:03] That's an amateur tribulation. I'm not
[1:08:06] trying to ski. I'm trying to wake you
[1:08:07] up.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; That's a brother. That's an amateur
[1:08:10] tribulation. The things that those
[1:08:11] people suffered and went through in that
[1:08:14] war. And it'll be global this time.
[1:08:18] We don't want to be caught. We don't
[1:08:19] need to be caught up in that. We don't
[1:08:21] need to be left behind. There's not a
[1:08:23] single reason why any of us should be
[1:08:25] here. God's grace is so great. The door
[1:08:28] of mercy is so wide. It's so easy to
[1:08:31] walk through.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't be worried about Russia
[1:08:35] and China and all these things. No.
[1:08:39] Romanism is going to rule the world.
[1:08:43] Which was the iron and clay in the
[1:08:44] bottom of the feet? Was it communism?
[1:08:46] No, sir. It was Romanism and
[1:08:47] Protestantism. Exactly right. That iron
[1:08:50] that steel iron ro Rome right down to
[1:08:52] the end. It's Romanism.
[1:08:56] Amen. During this time when the when the
[1:08:59] see this iron and clay this
[1:09:00] Protestantism the Bible says where you
[1:09:03] know speaking when when when John is
[1:09:05] shown the shown the great hall that sits
[1:09:07] upon many waters in Revelation 17. We
[1:09:09] know this is symbolic of the you know of
[1:09:12] a it's it's symbolic of the Catholic
[1:09:14] Church sits upon many waters which is
[1:09:16] peoples, multitudes, nations and tongues
[1:09:19] and it rules. And then he was so he was
[1:09:21] so amazed by this thing. He says as the
[1:09:23] kings of the earth have committed
[1:09:25] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[1:09:26] earth have made drunk with the wine of
[1:09:28] her fornication. So this world has
[1:09:29] become drunk by its pleasures and riches
[1:09:32] and promises. Can't walk straight
[1:09:34] anymore. Can't see straight. Can't speak
[1:09:36] right. Because you ever seen a drunk
[1:09:38] man? Well, I used to be one. Could I
[1:09:40] walk straight? No. Could I talk
[1:09:42] straight? No. Could I think straight?
[1:09:44] No. Did I act normal? Absolutely not.
[1:09:46] While I was drunk and this world is
[1:09:49] teetering back and forth.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; That's why people get so don't get drunk
[1:09:52] on social media. Whatever you do, don't
[1:09:55] try and escape on those things. I just
[1:09:57] want to make a little hole and make a
[1:09:59] little world and live in it. Just just
[1:10:00] live out this thing. The only way of
[1:10:02] escape is in Jesus Christ, the word.
[1:10:04] Amen. You get into this message. Let
[1:10:06] this message take control of your life.
[1:10:08] Let God become a reality in you. You
[1:10:10] know the same God in the book of Acts.
[1:10:11] You can meet, you can know, you can
[1:10:13] experience. Amen. That when you read the
[1:10:15] book of Acts, you say, "I know that God.
[1:10:17] He's done the same things. He's led me
[1:10:18] the same way." Amen. I've seen him
[1:10:20] fulfill his word in my life. Hallelujah.
[1:10:22] I've met that same God. Amen. You have
[1:10:24] that satisfaction that that you know in
[1:10:26] whom you have believed.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But what happens is
[1:10:30] she's called the mother of harlots and
[1:10:32] the abominations of the earth. Now, in
[1:10:33] order to be a mother, you've got to have
[1:10:35] children. Amen. So, what is that? That's
[1:10:37] the that's the um denominational
[1:10:39] systems. Now, when I talk about these
[1:10:41] things, I'm not against the people. The
[1:10:44] Pope's not my enemy. I'm not against
[1:10:46] him. I'm not against some religious, you
[1:10:48] know, the people in those systems. Many
[1:10:50] sincere people are caught up in these
[1:10:52] things. It's the spirit that holds them
[1:10:54] back. If that spirit disappeared, I
[1:10:56] believe everyone who's genuine would
[1:10:58] just walk into the word. That's me.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm not against the people.
[1:11:03] I'm against the system. Like, God bless
[1:11:05] the SDA for letting us use their church.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say amen for you. God bless
[1:11:13] them.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many good people in this place.
[1:11:17] Many good people, but they're caught up
[1:11:19] in a system. Now, why on earth would we
[1:11:23] go to that system to see what's going on
[1:11:25] in this day?
[1:11:27] Amen. It's like people, you know, during
[1:11:29] during co I would receive uh videos, you
[1:11:33] know, from believers and they would be
[1:11:35] from 7th Day Adventist
[1:11:38] conspiracy thing going on and they try
[1:11:40] and say that the COVID vaccine is the
[1:11:42] mark of the beast or it could be the
[1:11:44] mark of the beast. Now, my first
[1:11:46] question was why would you go to
[1:11:48] something caught up in this world system
[1:11:49] for an answer about what the world
[1:11:51] system is doing?
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Number one. Number two, why would you
[1:11:55] not just take it back into the word of
[1:11:56] God?
[1:11:58] Jesus said very simply, it's not that
[1:12:00] which goes into the man which defiles a
[1:12:02] man. Amen. It's not there's no such
[1:12:05] thing as the God gene. Then you can just
[1:12:08] change it and everyone becomes either a
[1:12:09] believer or not a believer. It's far
[1:12:12] deeper than your DNA. It's not got
[1:12:14] nothing to do with this DNA. This this
[1:12:16] person, it's got nothing to do with
[1:12:18] that's your soul.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's that gene seed in your
[1:12:20] soul, not in your body. It's got nothing
[1:12:22] to do with it. So what but but so I
[1:12:24] actually you I said I you asked a
[1:12:26] question politely to someone. I said
[1:12:28] look this is from what denomination?
[1:12:31] What does the message say? What has been
[1:12:33] declared in this generation? What does
[1:12:34] the Bible say about these things? It's
[1:12:36] not a tattoo. It's not a microchip. It's
[1:12:38] not a vaccine. No, it's a spiritual
[1:12:40] mark. I mean to turn down the Holy Ghost
[1:12:43] is to receive the mark of the beast. I
[1:12:45] mean the seal of God is the baptism of
[1:12:47] the Holy Ghost. It's been running down
[1:12:48] through the ages. It will come to full
[1:12:50] manifestation one day.
[1:12:53] The seal of God will come into full
[1:12:55] manifestation. How will it come to full
[1:12:56] manifestation? These bodies will be
[1:12:58] changed.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:03] Amen. People get caught up in all these
[1:13:04] things.
[1:13:07] We don't need to we don't need to focus.
[1:13:10] It's not even in the Bible. If it's not
[1:13:12] in the Bible, forget it.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Bam says, don't watch
[1:13:17] about that.
[1:13:19] Don't watch iron curtains and bamboo
[1:13:20] curtains, but watch the purple curtain.
[1:13:23] That's the one that's going to get you.
[1:13:25] The religious curtain. He says the
[1:13:28] bamboo curtain, that's what that that's
[1:13:30] red China. What's the iron curtain? That
[1:13:32] was the Soviet Union, but hey, it's just
[1:13:34] come back basically. Amen. What? It's
[1:13:36] east verse west again. He says, don't
[1:13:39] worry about those things. Don't be
[1:13:41] caught up in what they're doing. No,
[1:13:42] it's the purple curtain that will get
[1:13:44] you.
[1:13:46] Don't you never worry about that. You
[1:13:48] mark that down. Say, "Brother Bram said
[1:13:49] it and put it in your Bible and see it's
[1:13:51] right. Communism is is nothing but a
[1:13:53] tool in God's hand playing right up."
[1:13:55] Why? It won't amount to nothing. That's
[1:13:58] exactly right. Don't fear about that.
[1:14:00] That's something they'll throw off. That
[1:14:02] will throw you off the track of looking.
[1:14:04] What's he talking about looking at the
[1:14:06] word? It will throw you off the track.
[1:14:08] All these things that rise up are just
[1:14:10] things to get you off track.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it doesn't matter how close to
[1:14:15] home it may come. Don't be caught up in
[1:14:17] it. I mean, it's like the Black Lives
[1:14:19] Matter movement. That was a horrible
[1:14:20] murder of George Floyd. That was a
[1:14:22] terrible evil that was done to that man
[1:14:24] and many others. But don't be caught up
[1:14:26] in a socialist move to just try and it's
[1:14:28] just because all it is is a symbol or a
[1:14:31] road mark on the road saying America is
[1:14:33] eating itself alive.
[1:14:36] Okay? We could we all of us could be
[1:14:38] caught up in something.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Don't be caught up in it. It won't help
[1:14:42] you. It won't help your family. Yeah, it
[1:14:45] won't help nobody.
[1:14:47] What is all it's doing is just showing
[1:14:49] this world is eating itself alive.
[1:14:52] And I can say the same thing in this
[1:14:54] country with the treaty, not the treaty,
[1:14:57] whatever more. Forget it. That's just
[1:14:59] this country is going to eat itself
[1:15:00] alive.
[1:15:02] Well, those are strong words. You just
[1:15:04] No. Well, we won't be watching. I trust
[1:15:06] we'll be dancing around a wedding supper
[1:15:08] table. We won't see it. Amen. But when
[1:15:10] we're doing that, there'll be a lot of
[1:15:11] murder and hatred being spilled out upon
[1:15:14] this place because of resentment that's
[1:15:16] been built up and brewing under the
[1:15:18] Well, it's not even really under the
[1:15:19] surface anymore. And both sides,
[1:15:21] remember, they're both baddies.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're both baddies. Why? Cuz
[1:15:26] it's just that spirit, that iron and
[1:15:28] clay that can't mix.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's nothing. But the Bible
[1:15:35] readers and the men who love God stay
[1:15:37] with that Bible said certainly just
[1:15:39] watch that.
[1:15:42] Amen.
[1:15:44] Because unfortunately, wait, what have I
[1:15:46] got here?
[1:15:48] So this Babylon the great here. Let's
[1:15:50] just come to this. I'm really want to
[1:15:51] come. I just want to talk about the
[1:15:52] stone, but I got to talk about
[1:15:53] everything else to get to the stone.
[1:15:55] That's the only thing that really
[1:15:55] excites me in this thing. Okay? I just
[1:15:57] want to get to him. Amen. Because we're
[1:15:59] part of him. Amen. But we got to get to
[1:16:01] him first. Okay? But you know even as
[1:16:03] John would say that this you know he
[1:16:05] said and after these things I saw
[1:16:06] another angel come down from heaven
[1:16:07] having great power and the earth was
[1:16:09] lighted with his glory. You know that's
[1:16:11] the ministry of Malachi 4. That's the
[1:16:13] ministry of brother Brown there lights
[1:16:15] the whole earth. Amen. And he and and he
[1:16:17] cried mightily with a loud voice saying
[1:16:19] Babylon the great has fall and has
[1:16:20] fallen has become the habitation of
[1:16:22] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:16:25] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:16:27] bird. And all nations have drunk of the
[1:16:29] wine of the wrath of her fornication.
[1:16:31] And the kings of the earth have
[1:16:32] committed fornication with her. And the
[1:16:33] merchants of the earth are waxed rich
[1:16:35] for the abundance of her delicacies. And
[1:16:37] I heard another voice from heaven
[1:16:39] saying, "Come out of her, my people, and
[1:16:41] be not partaker of her sins, that ye
[1:16:43] receive not of her plagues." Amen. So
[1:16:45] there's a call that's come, a prophetic
[1:16:46] voice has come in this day. Come out of
[1:16:48] this world system. Don't be caught up in
[1:16:51] it. Amen. Don't be don't be so caught up
[1:16:53] in, you know, mixing mixing religion
[1:16:56] with politics. Don't be caught up in
[1:16:58] trying to restore and fix historical
[1:17:00] injustices. I mean, don't be caught up
[1:17:02] in trying to make countries great again.
[1:17:05] How many countries around the world,
[1:17:06] especially the young people, they say,
[1:17:07] "We're going to rebuild this country."
[1:17:10] You won't be able to do it. I hate to
[1:17:12] say it
[1:17:14] cuz it's got to come to nothing. It's
[1:17:16] got to be destroyed. It's got to move
[1:17:17] off the scene. And then why? Cuz the
[1:17:19] kingdom of God is going to be
[1:17:20] established upon this world.
[1:17:23] I mean, so don't be, you know, don't be
[1:17:25] caught up with mi mixing religion with
[1:17:27] politics. Come out of it. It's not going
[1:17:29] to save the world. I'm sorry. I watched
[1:17:34] Charlie Kirk's memorial service. Watched
[1:17:36] pretty much the whole thing. He did a
[1:17:38] lot of good. He said a lot of good
[1:17:40] things, but he mixed religion and
[1:17:42] politics. It ain't going to make America
[1:17:44] great again. It's going to look like
[1:17:46] it's going to be good, but it's actually
[1:17:47] just in the hands of Romanism taking
[1:17:49] over. You know, most of the Supreme
[1:17:51] Court judges are basically Catholic.
[1:17:54] There's Catholic on both sides of the
[1:17:55] white and blue ruling the whole thing.
[1:17:59] It's just Romanism has taken over that
[1:18:01] country. It started with freedom of
[1:18:02] religion. But it says in Revelations 3
[1:18:04] that it looked like a lamb had two
[1:18:06] horns, ecclesiastical and civil power.
[1:18:08] Amen. Came became freedom of religion.
[1:18:10] But then it spake as the dragon.
[1:18:12] Revelations 13. It's been speaking like
[1:18:15] the dragon for a long time. But I think
[1:18:16] maybe we're just kind of woken up to the
[1:18:18] idea, hey, this is this is not a lamb
[1:18:20] speaking anymore.
[1:18:22] I mean, there was once upon a time, I
[1:18:24] think Teddy Roosevelt and different
[1:18:26] different great leaders of that country,
[1:18:27] not whatever you say about him, but
[1:18:29] different different American presidents
[1:18:31] would not go bow down to the pope and
[1:18:33] kiss his ring and, you know, pay him
[1:18:34] homage. Now, they flock there
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; cuz that spirit has come and taken over
[1:18:40] that place. Oh, but they're the goodies.
[1:18:42] They're going to save the world. No,
[1:18:43] they won't. Jesus Christ will save the
[1:18:46] world. All it is is a trap that's going
[1:18:49] to spring and going to trap many good
[1:18:52] people here
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; on both sides. Democrat, Democrat,
[1:18:57] Republican, doesn't matter what color of
[1:18:59] party here in New Zealand. Politics is
[1:19:01] rotten.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Politics, a good policy will never fix
[1:19:05] this world. I don't care how good it
[1:19:07] makes sense it will be. Don't be caught
[1:19:09] up in those things. Oh, it's interesting
[1:19:10] to watch. Yeah, it's good to look and
[1:19:12] see what are they up to. You know, it's
[1:19:14] like, you know, you pick up the
[1:19:16] newspaper, it's like, yeah, it's right
[1:19:17] on schedule and under budget in God's
[1:19:20] economy. It's it's going exactly as it
[1:19:22] should be, right? So, it's good to keep
[1:19:24] tabs with those things, but don't be
[1:19:26] caught up in it. Don't be so gripped
[1:19:28] like, oh, what's happening and what this
[1:19:29] is doing? Oh, this is so bad. And no,
[1:19:31] don't be caught up. We're in this world,
[1:19:33] but not of the world.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, come out of her, my
[1:19:38] people. Amen. Come out of mixing
[1:19:40] religion with politics. Amen. That's why
[1:19:42] I said the dangerous thing is actually a
[1:19:44] Christian nation that enforces amen
[1:19:46] their beliefs on people. It's like
[1:19:48] Islam. Islam's not going to do anything.
[1:19:52] People are so worried about Islam. Oh,
[1:19:54] what's it? It's going to take over the
[1:19:55] world. It ain't going to take over the
[1:19:57] world.
[1:19:58] It ain't. The Bible never said it would.
[1:20:02] It's Romanism that has taken over the
[1:20:04] world. It's Romanism that's going to
[1:20:06] control this world and is and it's going
[1:20:07] to and all it's bringing is into people
[1:20:10] into the great tribulation. I'm sorry,
[1:20:12] but that's just how it is. Oh, but we
[1:20:13] need some baddy to fight against. Yeah,
[1:20:16] there's a devil ruling this world, but
[1:20:18] we're not part of this world. Amen. We
[1:20:20] don't need to join his system to bring
[1:20:22] it down. No way. Amen. What do we do? We
[1:20:25] just become one with the Lord Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ. I tell you what, friends, you'll
[1:20:28] see is you know the reason wait, let's
[1:20:30] just come to it. He says in Hebrews,
[1:20:33] well, let's go back here. Sorry. Cuz now
[1:20:35] I want to get to the stone. This is
[1:20:38] really re really where I wanted to get
[1:20:40] to. Everyone follow me so far? Don't be
[1:20:42] caught up in these things. Don't be so
[1:20:44] gripped by it. It won't help you. It
[1:20:46] won't bring deliverance. It won't bring
[1:20:48] It won't bring a rapture to you. Let it
[1:20:51] go. Okay? Doesn't matter how close to
[1:20:53] home it is in your life. Let it go. It's
[1:20:56] not worth living for. It's not a hill to
[1:20:59] die on. Amen. because it does not bring
[1:21:02] you it will not bring you victory. He
[1:21:04] says and then verse 35, then it was the
[1:21:06] iron and clay and brass and silver and
[1:21:08] the gold broken in pieces together and
[1:21:10] become like the chaff of the summer
[1:21:11] threshing floors and the wind carried
[1:21:13] them away that no place was found for
[1:21:15] them and the stone that smoked the image
[1:21:17] became a great mountain and filled the
[1:21:19] whole earth. He says this is the dream
[1:21:21] and we will tell the interpretation
[1:21:23] thereof before the king and we've
[1:21:24] already read that. So this he says this
[1:21:26] stone that came that was cut out of the
[1:21:27] mountain will smite this image smite
[1:21:30] this world system in the feet and it
[1:21:32] will just destroy it completely as be
[1:21:34] carried away by the wind like chaff. So
[1:21:36] these metals that are so heavy and so
[1:21:38] rigid and strong will be reduced down to
[1:21:40] powder and it will be gone and this
[1:21:42] stone will become a great mountain. It
[1:21:44] will fill the whole earth. Amen. Where
[1:21:46] the kingdom of God will go from sea to
[1:21:48] sea.
[1:21:49] Amen. But I tell you what, friends, it's
[1:21:51] not us who tries to bring back the
[1:21:52] kingdom of God politically.
[1:21:55] Amen. It's not us that tries to rewrite
[1:21:57] the laws and all these things. No, God
[1:21:58] will make his kingdom upon the earth.
[1:22:00] Amen. When the great millennium rolls in
[1:22:02] after the great tribulation and wedding
[1:22:04] supper, what will that be? The kingdom
[1:22:06] of God will fill this world. Amen. Then
[1:22:08] after the battle of Gog and Magog and
[1:22:10] the judgment, all these things, new
[1:22:11] heaven and new earth, what is that? That
[1:22:13] stone that came out of the mountain
[1:22:14] without hands and that smoke, the image
[1:22:16] will destroy the system. There'll come a
[1:22:18] day where the system that we're under
[1:22:20] right now won't even be a memory.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, doesn't matter what
[1:22:26] people have done around the world, it
[1:22:27] won't even be a memory today. Amen. No,
[1:22:29] cuz why? We'll be under the glory of God
[1:22:31] for eternity to roll on. Praise the
[1:22:34] Lord. So, I tell you what, friends, this
[1:22:35] stone that came out of the mountain is
[1:22:37] not a piece of stone like a piece of
[1:22:39] masonry, a piece of, you know, just a
[1:22:41] literal piece of um rock. No, this is a
[1:22:44] living stone. I mean, this is Christ
[1:22:46] Jesus the Lord. Amen. This is God
[1:22:48] himself. Amen. And where does that where
[1:22:50] does that begin now in our lives? That
[1:22:53] stone has got to come in because you got
[1:22:54] to realize that by your generations, you
[1:22:57] have been very much bound up.
[1:23:01] Your natural birth has been intertwined
[1:23:03] with this image. Whether you like it or
[1:23:05] not, it doesn't matter where you come
[1:23:07] from. It's it's it's literally part of
[1:23:10] us.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. By our by our natural birth. But
[1:23:14] God's got to take take his word. take
[1:23:17] his word and let it come into your soul
[1:23:19] and it begins to smash this image down
[1:23:22] where you realize actually I'm not a New
[1:23:24] Zealander. Actually, I'm not from Africa
[1:23:26] or wherever you're from. No, I'm from
[1:23:28] heaven.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You realize, no, I'm more I'm born
[1:23:31] in this country. Sure, I may talk like a
[1:23:33] Kiwi, act like a Kiwi. I don't bri like
[1:23:36] a kiwi, but you know what I mean? You
[1:23:38] know, but the thing is I'm not a kiwi.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; I'm a heaven-ent bird. Amen. I'm from
[1:23:42] heaven. Hallelujah. I'm not some night
[1:23:45] dwelling flightless thing who eats bugs.
[1:23:47] No, I fly in the heavenlies. Amen. I'm
[1:23:50] from a different world.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Is that okay? I won't
[1:23:54] trample on any other national spirits.
[1:23:55] Amen. People get all defensive. But
[1:23:58] we're not from those. Do I love this
[1:24:00] country? Absolutely. I'm glad to be a
[1:24:02] Kiwi, but I'm not a Kiwi.
[1:24:05] Praise the Lord. Does that make sense? I
[1:24:07] trust it does. I I I like this country.
[1:24:10] It's a great place to live, right? Every
[1:24:13] country we should live be be living. We
[1:24:15] should be happy. We should enjoy it. But
[1:24:17] we're not from that place. Our identity
[1:24:18] is not wrapped up in the national spirit
[1:24:20] of that land. Not at all. Amen. No. Our
[1:24:23] identity is from heaven. Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this so so the stone
[1:24:28] comes down. Christ himself comes down
[1:24:30] into you and smashes this image out of
[1:24:33] you. The Babylonian ideas. Remember
[1:24:35] Babylon just means confusion.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; And this world is very confused today.
[1:24:40] Amen. It is incredibly confused. Like I
[1:24:43] said before, there's arguments about
[1:24:45] what bathroom to use.
[1:24:47] What is a man? What is a woman? What's a
[1:24:49] what's the definition of a woman? These
[1:24:51] things should not even need to be argued
[1:24:53] about or discussed. It's pretty
[1:24:56] straightforward.
[1:24:58] I mean, seriously, this is this is this
[1:25:00] is the this is meant to be the apex of
[1:25:02] ci civilization of progressive ideas and
[1:25:05] three, you know, free thought and
[1:25:07] democratic society. And our big
[1:25:09] polarizing thing is what's a woman? What
[1:25:12] bathroom to use? Have we ascended or
[1:25:14] descended
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; this world?
[1:25:19] But as I said, that thing comes in,
[1:25:20] subdues,
[1:25:22] devours. Amen. Breaks down everyone's
[1:25:25] identity sadly. But we are called to
[1:25:27] come out of that thing. Now, where was
[1:25:30] I?
[1:25:32] Amen. And he says in the book of
[1:25:34] Hebrews, he said, "Yet once more I'll
[1:25:35] shake not the earth only, but also
[1:25:37] heaven."
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; And this world yet once more signifies
[1:25:40] the removing of those things that are
[1:25:42] shaken. What is the removing of those
[1:25:44] things? It's that image. It's that world
[1:25:46] system. That's that thing that can be
[1:25:49] shaken. Amen. As of things that are
[1:25:51] made. So anything that's man-made can be
[1:25:55] shaken. And this is why people are
[1:25:57] shaking today. It's because they got
[1:25:59] their faith in the wrong thing. Amen.
[1:26:01] Because if your faith is in man-made
[1:26:03] ideas mixed with the word, it can be
[1:26:05] shaken cuz it's man-made. Amen. But if
[1:26:08] your if your faith is in the eternal
[1:26:11] revealed word of God, amen, you cannot
[1:26:14] be shaken. That thing cannot be removed.
[1:26:16] Amen. It will endure forever. Praise the
[1:26:19] Lord. But things that can be made are
[1:26:21] being shaken. This whole world's being
[1:26:22] shaken. Isn't it interesting? We have
[1:26:25] the best technology,
[1:26:27] but yet things just don't work.
[1:26:31] Why doesn't our health care system work?
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; We got a big problem with leaky pipes in
[1:26:37] the city.
[1:26:39] Why doesn't that work? Why is it being
[1:26:41] fixed? Why is not being looked after?
[1:26:43] There's an energy crisis. All these
[1:26:44] things is should just work. Why is it
[1:26:48] not? Because everything's being shaken.
[1:26:50] Everything's falling apart.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Whether we like it or not, because on
[1:26:56] paper it should be, man, this thing
[1:26:57] should just work. We got automation. We
[1:27:00] can, you know, we can machine learning.
[1:27:02] We could just, man, we could just have
[1:27:03] this thing easy. Why isn't it working?
[1:27:07] Why is everyone so polarized? Why can't
[1:27:09] people even talk and sit down and have a
[1:27:10] discussion about things and disagree,
[1:27:12] but yet get along? Cuz everything has
[1:27:15] been shaking. Nothing can nothing can
[1:27:17] gel. Probably the iron and clay won't
[1:27:19] mix.
[1:27:20] Amen. So everything that can be shaken
[1:27:22] will be shaken. So if your if your if
[1:27:25] your um you know Adam's man's ideas,
[1:27:30] political religious ideas are man-made.
[1:27:32] Those are things that are made. It's
[1:27:34] like Adam when he made the fig leaf
[1:27:35] covering. Religion just really means a
[1:27:37] covering. Adam Adam manufactured a
[1:27:40] covering for his sin. Amen. But then
[1:27:42] when he came into the presence of God,
[1:27:43] he hid. He was afraid. Amen. His scheme
[1:27:46] in the garden was just a covering that
[1:27:48] came to nothing. Amen. And it had to be.
[1:27:51] And you know when man mixes religion and
[1:27:53] political ideas to control people, it's
[1:27:55] just a covering of trying to cover man's
[1:27:57] sinful nature. See, that's what happens
[1:28:00] with the religious political right. They
[1:28:01] think, let's just make the laws really
[1:28:03] hard and really strict and that will
[1:28:06] make the world moral. It won't do it. It
[1:28:10] won't fix nothing. It's just a covering.
[1:28:12] Tries to cover over, oh yes, we're the
[1:28:14] legal, you know, I mean, we're the moral
[1:28:16] side of society. And both sides say that
[1:28:19] it's just a covering of man's sinful
[1:28:21] nature. You'll never you'll never
[1:28:23] manufacture a covering that will take
[1:28:24] care of the sin problem. I mean, because
[1:28:26] when God when God gets a hold of us, he
[1:28:29] doesn't start on the outside. He doesn't
[1:28:31] cover us over that way. He starts on the
[1:28:33] inside and it works out. I mean, the
[1:28:34] word of God, the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:28:36] your soul. You open up your heart, he
[1:28:38] comes into your soul. What does he do?
[1:28:39] And he starts working from the inside
[1:28:41] out. I mean, someone who's truly born
[1:28:43] again, you don't need to get them to
[1:28:44] conform to the word. You don't need to
[1:28:46] preach legalistic ideas or even a even a
[1:28:48] closline religion. Like brother Araham
[1:28:51] said when he went to Africa, there was
[1:28:52] the blanket natives half naked sitting
[1:28:54] there listening to the preaching of the
[1:28:55] gospel. He said the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:28:57] them. He said you didn't need to teach
[1:28:59] the woman to cover up. They just went
[1:29:00] and got covered up when the Holy Ghost
[1:29:02] fell on them. They realized their true
[1:29:03] state.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell you what, the Holy Ghost is
[1:29:08] the answer for everything.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The inside life, the hidden life
[1:29:12] of Christ will fix everything. Amen.
[1:29:14] West's got to give him a chance to rule.
[1:29:16] Give him a chance to work. Amen. The new
[1:29:20] See this, See, this world is shaking
[1:29:22] because it's in the process of being
[1:29:23] removed.
[1:29:27] The new birth, the true baptism of the
[1:29:28] Holy Ghost is not a covering, but a
[1:29:30] transformation from the inside out.
[1:29:32] Amen. World systems are being shaken.
[1:29:34] It's in the process of being removed.
[1:29:36] People are shaken because their faith is
[1:29:38] in the wrong idea.
[1:29:40] If your faith is in in the word of God,
[1:29:43] I'll show you something that cannot be
[1:29:45] moved. It doesn't matter how big the
[1:29:47] storm, how big the quake, how big the
[1:29:50] shake, how big the problem, how big, how
[1:29:52] how difficult, how impossible the the
[1:29:54] thing may be. No, there's a person who's
[1:29:57] unmovable. Amen. You see, Shadrach,
[1:30:00] Meshach, and Abedneo, and Babylon, they
[1:30:02] weren't built on man-made ideas. They
[1:30:04] weren't made on man-made religion. They
[1:30:06] weren't they did not have a fig leaf
[1:30:08] covering to cover up the fact they were
[1:30:10] in a foreign land working for an enemy
[1:30:11] government. No, they had a revelation.
[1:30:15] You shall know make no idols. You'll not
[1:30:18] bow yourself down to any graven image.
[1:30:20] They had that in their minds. They said
[1:30:21] we will not go against this thing
[1:30:23] because it's a firm foundation our
[1:30:24] lives. And they said to the king, king,
[1:30:26] if we burn, we burn. If we don't, we
[1:30:28] don't. God's able to deliver. They had
[1:30:30] no move of the spirit. They had no
[1:30:32] prophecy. They had no sign of God. All
[1:30:34] they had was the fact they standing on
[1:30:35] thus sayeth the Lord and God allowed
[1:30:38] them to go into the furnace.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in them that could be
[1:30:42] shaken. There are other Hebrews that
[1:30:43] bowed down to that idol because it
[1:30:46] wasn't revelation in their hearts. It
[1:30:48] was man-made ideas. Oh yes, mentally we
[1:30:50] got to keep the law of Moses. Mentally
[1:30:52] we're we're Hebrews. Mentally we got to
[1:30:53] do these things. It was man-made ideas
[1:30:56] only and it was shaken and they bowed.
[1:30:59] But Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo, it
[1:31:02] was a firm found. You couldn't shake
[1:31:03] them.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Were they intimidated? Probably a little
[1:31:07] bit. But that was but what was in their
[1:31:10] hearts was far greater than the
[1:31:11] intimidation of the statue, the king,
[1:31:12] the music, all these things. Who's with
[1:31:15] me today?
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the thing is the miracle to me
[1:31:18] isn't the actually the fact of the
[1:31:19] fourth man in the fire. The miracle to
[1:31:21] me is the fact they stood with no sign,
[1:31:23] no wonder, no favorite preacher, no
[1:31:26] camp, you know, camp environment, no
[1:31:28] moving of the spirit. They just had that
[1:31:29] fact. No, we will not move off the word
[1:31:31] of God. Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; That's a miracle, man.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They didn't know that
[1:31:36] God would meet them in the furnace. They
[1:31:37] just said, "Well, if we burn, we burn.
[1:31:38] If we don't, well, we don't. But we
[1:31:40] ain't bowing."
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; They're very simple people. This is just
[1:31:43] we we have two options, King. And
[1:31:45] actually, we only have one option. We're
[1:31:47] not bowing. The outcome, it's in God's
[1:31:49] hands.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we burn up, we know where we're
[1:31:52] going. We're going up. Amen. Amen. If we
[1:31:54] come out, well, we're coming out. That's
[1:31:55] fine. God is able to do it. And what
[1:31:57] they do? They had a firm foundation.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. This message has come to call a
[1:32:03] people out of this world system. It's a
[1:32:05] prophetic message and it's not that
[1:32:06] that's why it was outside the do
[1:32:08] denominational ranks. It was didn't come
[1:32:10] out of some Bible school. Didn't come
[1:32:12] out of some seminary. You look at John
[1:32:14] the Baptist. He's standing there. His
[1:32:16] father was a priest. Why did he not
[1:32:18] continue as a line of a priest and then
[1:32:19] be the forerunner? His job was too
[1:32:21] important. He couldn't be caught up in
[1:32:23] the religious world system. He was
[1:32:25] outside of that system. And then begin
[1:32:27] to call a people and call him to
[1:32:29] repentance cuz his mission was I'm going
[1:32:31] to point out the lamb of God. How will
[1:32:32] you know him, John? God will show me who
[1:32:34] it is. The one that the spirit of God
[1:32:36] descends upon and abides. That's the
[1:32:38] Messiah. Then one day he says he's right
[1:32:40] among you right now. Amen. And what did
[1:32:42] he do? He pointed him out and his
[1:32:44] preaching, what did his preaching do?
[1:32:46] Broke a people free from that world
[1:32:48] system. Amen. There could have been
[1:32:49] scribes and Pharisees there. They went
[1:32:51] to a meeting of John's. They didn't stay
[1:32:52] a scribe or Pharisee. Amen. And they got
[1:32:54] washed from that system, that Babylonian
[1:32:56] thing, by the preaching of the word.
[1:32:58] Amen. Brought them out of that system
[1:33:00] that when they saw the lamb of God, they
[1:33:01] said, "That's the one."
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's the one. John, you
[1:33:05] are pointing out and we see him and now
[1:33:06] we can walk with him. I tell you what,
[1:33:08] friends, this message has done the same
[1:33:09] thing. Amen. Cuz as God spoke, as John
[1:33:12] the Baptist forun the first coming of
[1:33:14] Christ, so your message, brother's
[1:33:16] message will forun the second coming.
[1:33:17] And what did it do? He pointed out the
[1:33:19] lamb of God, the Messiah, the revealed
[1:33:20] word in this day. And what did it do?
[1:33:22] caused us to leave this world system.
[1:33:24] Caused us to leave whatever religion
[1:33:26] we're born in. Caused us to leave those
[1:33:28] things. It actually separated us from
[1:33:30] the darkness and brought us into
[1:33:31] glorious light.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Why? There was a
[1:33:34] shaking but it shook us free.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You remember that time you
[1:33:39] analy you're agonizing under the weight
[1:33:41] of sin and realizing you were lost,
[1:33:44] realizing you needed a savior, but you
[1:33:45] knew he was there to save you. What was
[1:33:47] that? There was a shaking took place.
[1:33:49] Amen. Because a shaking will cause some
[1:33:50] things to stay and some things to go. I
[1:33:52] tell you what, friends, it caused you to
[1:33:54] leave. Amen. Caused you to leave your
[1:33:56] old life. Leave where you came from.
[1:33:57] Leave your first birth in your culture
[1:33:59] and whatever you came and brought you
[1:34:00] into the living God. Amen. Brought you
[1:34:03] into become part of the stone. Amen. The
[1:34:05] stone cut out of the mountain. Amen.
[1:34:06] With Christ Jesus himself. Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] What did it do? It caused you, Amen, to
[1:34:11] come out that whenever whatever is
[1:34:13] trending to try and sweep you back in.
[1:34:15] Can't sweep you back in. Can't sweep you
[1:34:17] back into that system. Amen. Doesn't
[1:34:20] matter what movement it is. Amen. Co,
[1:34:22] Black Lives Matter, polit political
[1:34:24] religious revival around the world,
[1:34:25] so-called environmentalism, what China's
[1:34:28] doing, what Russia's doing, whatever
[1:34:30] thing it is, it can't sweep you back in.
[1:34:35] Treaty issues, whatever it is,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; that wind can't shake you back in
[1:34:39] because you've been called out.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; You didn't realize it, but when you
[1:34:42] heard the message, God was saying, "Come
[1:34:44] out of her, my people. You're my people.
[1:34:47] I can't leave you in that cage. I can't
[1:34:49] leave you in that system. You've got to
[1:34:51] come out and walk with me. I mean, I
[1:34:52] don't want you caught up in the things
[1:34:54] of the world. Come into me.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:59] Hallelujah.
[1:35:02] Amen. But he says this. He says,
[1:35:03] "Wherefore we receiving a kingdom that
[1:35:06] cannot be moved." Amen. Let us have
[1:35:09] grace whereby we may serve God
[1:35:11] acceptably with reverence and godly
[1:35:12] fear, for our God is a consuming fire.
[1:35:16] And that's why I say friends, I think we
[1:35:17] can look back in our lives and we can
[1:35:19] look to where God's brought us now and
[1:35:21] we we trust the Lord more. Amen. There's
[1:35:24] actually nothing that we become more
[1:35:26] stable in our walk. We know in whom we
[1:35:28] have believed. We're not tossed to and
[1:35:29] fro with every wind of doctrine. Amen.
[1:35:32] God's done a work. Why? He's actually
[1:35:34] shaken us free of the man-made systems.
[1:35:37] Brought us into his revealed word.
[1:35:38] Brought us into Christ that we know and
[1:35:40] who we have believed. Like brother Colin
[1:35:42] was telling me in the car on Friday,
[1:35:44] he's my shepherd.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; To me, it's like what a beautiful thing
[1:35:48] you're telling me. Wish everyone had
[1:35:49] that same heart. The Lord's my shepherd.
[1:35:52] He's going to lead me. He's not going to
[1:35:53] lead me anywhere. He's not going to
[1:35:55] forsake me. He's going to lead me
[1:35:56] through. I just trust him.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, Brother
[1:35:59] Colin.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And that should be And what is that?
[1:36:01] That's a stable walk.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of wind blowing around,
[1:36:04] but you just Okay, Lord, where we're
[1:36:06] going?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, I can see it. You've
[1:36:08] shown me in your word. I'm walking,
[1:36:10] Lord.
[1:36:10] Let's go, Lord. You're going before me.
[1:36:12] I trust you, Lord. I'm not worried,
[1:36:13] Lord, because you're here. You said
[1:36:15] you'd never leave me nor forsake me.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have received a
[1:36:19] kingdom that cannot be moved.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what lies come up.
[1:36:23] Doesn't matter what accusations come up.
[1:36:25] We cannot be moved.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:36:32] Let's read this one. Politics, oh my,
[1:36:34] how shaky. People just argue and argue
[1:36:35] and argue about politics. Neighbors will
[1:36:37] fall out about it. People were once good
[1:36:39] friends. Some president will rise up and
[1:36:41] on or somebody to run for the sheriff or
[1:36:43] something and some other fellow on the
[1:36:45] other side of the pol political fence
[1:36:47] and they'll fuss with one another until
[1:36:48] they fall out about it. Politics and I
[1:36:50] don't want to hurt somebody's feelings,
[1:36:51] but I think the whole thing's rotten.
[1:36:53] Yes, sir. So why would you fuss and fall
[1:36:55] out about something that ain't good
[1:36:56] anyhow? That's right. It's just awful
[1:36:59] bad. So why be caught up in these
[1:37:01] things?
[1:37:04] But God's been moving.
[1:37:07] God's been moving. The stone that has
[1:37:10] come cuz it's it's come. Christ is here.
[1:37:13] The his spirit his word is here. We'll
[1:37:15] meet his body in the air. But he is here
[1:37:17] in spirit form and word form. What's he
[1:37:19] come? He's come now what? To break this
[1:37:22] image down into powder. And it's caused
[1:37:25] a moving. It's caused a translation
[1:37:27] where it says that who hath delivered us
[1:37:30] from the kingdom of power of darkness
[1:37:31] and has translated us into the kingdom
[1:37:33] of his dear son. That word translation
[1:37:35] actually means you've been moved. You've
[1:37:38] been transferred. Amen. You've left one
[1:37:40] place and gone to another place.
[1:37:42] Hallelujah. Not I'm not talking about
[1:37:43] geographically here upon the earth. I'm
[1:37:45] talking about spiritually. And we were
[1:37:46] once caught up in this image. I just
[1:37:48] thinking just just rejoicing in this
[1:37:50] this week. It's like the blood of Jesus
[1:37:52] Christ is washing like a great flood.
[1:37:54] Amen. And was it has broken you out of
[1:37:56] the system. It's broken you out of the
[1:37:58] things of the world. Why? Because
[1:38:00] there's a gathering that's been going
[1:38:01] on. And this word has gathered you to
[1:38:04] Christ
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; cuz this message is Christ.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I tell you what,
[1:38:08] friends. This message has come to call
[1:38:10] us out.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; It's come to call us out and not to a
[1:38:15] wilderness, not to a nowhere place, not
[1:38:18] to some void place of nothing. But it's
[1:38:20] called us to Amen. It's called us to
[1:38:23] fountains of living water. Amen. It's
[1:38:25] called us to where there's shady green
[1:38:27] trees. There's green pasture. Amen.
[1:38:30] There's food. Amen. There's a flow of
[1:38:32] the spirit, amen, that flows without
[1:38:33] measure. Amen. There's shady green
[1:38:35] leaves of fellowship we can we can hide
[1:38:37] under when we get stressed and worried.
[1:38:39] Amen. There's joy unspeakable, full of
[1:38:41] glory. Amen. There's real identity.
[1:38:43] There's real peace. Amen. There's real
[1:38:46] joy. Amen. Why? Because we haven't just
[1:38:48] come to nowhere. We've come we we've
[1:38:50] been translated into the kingdom of his
[1:38:52] dear son.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Have you moved?
[1:38:58] If you're caught up in the things of the
[1:39:00] world, I'll say you haven't moved. You
[1:39:03] need to move. You need to let God move
[1:39:04] you. Oh, but these things and we're
[1:39:07] going to fix the world. You know why
[1:39:08] this? You know why there's such a push?
[1:39:10] Look, I love all the native birds. I had
[1:39:12] a trap. I left it at some house we moved
[1:39:13] from. If I had it, I put it out. I love
[1:39:16] all the native things. But we can't fix
[1:39:18] this world. We can't make it green
[1:39:21] again. God will do it in the millennium,
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; right? But man is trying to make a
[1:39:27] millennium without a Christ.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; He's trying to make an Eden without the
[1:39:31] very God who should be ruling that Eden.
[1:39:34] That's what man's been trying to do.
[1:39:38] Let's just finish with this. I think
[1:39:39] I've been a while. Pilate answered my
[1:39:42] Jew, says this is the Lord Jesus on
[1:39:44] trial there. Thine own nation and chief
[1:39:46] priests have delivered thee unto me and
[1:39:48] what has thou done? Jesus answered, my
[1:39:50] kingdom is not of this world. This is
[1:39:52] why we don't we don't make a message
[1:39:54] kingdom.
[1:39:56] We don't make a Christian empire
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; because it says my kingdom is is not of
[1:40:00] this world. If my kingdom of this world
[1:40:02] then my servants would fight. Amen. But
[1:40:05] that uh that I should not be delivered
[1:40:07] to the Jews, but now is my kingdom not
[1:40:09] from hence. Pilate therefore said unto
[1:40:11] him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
[1:40:13] answered, "Thou saith, I am a king. To
[1:40:15] this end was I born and for this cause I
[1:40:17] came into the world that I should bear
[1:40:19] witness unto the truth. Everyone that is
[1:40:21] of the truth heareth my voice. I say
[1:40:26] everyone that's part of that stone.
[1:40:28] Amen. Part of the kingdom of God hears
[1:40:30] the voice of God. I mean, here's him
[1:40:33] speaking today in 2025. We don't have to
[1:40:36] go back 2,000 years and hear his literal
[1:40:38] voice come out of his literal body. No,
[1:40:40] he's still speaking. He's still calling.
[1:40:43] This is what this message has come to
[1:40:44] do. It's come to call a bride. It's come
[1:40:46] to call part of God back to him. Amen.
[1:40:50] call his bride out. I mean, it's to be
[1:40:51] separated from the things of the world.
[1:40:53] I tell you what, you don't don't be
[1:40:55] caught up. I'm probably be Oh, you're a
[1:40:56] broken record while the needle's just
[1:40:58] stuck. Okay? Don't be caught up in these
[1:41:01] things of this world. These mental
[1:41:03] health problems have gone through the
[1:41:04] roof. Why? Because people are trying to
[1:41:07] either make it a false reality to live
[1:41:09] in or they're trying to fix this world
[1:41:11] and they're broken. But this because
[1:41:12] this beast power has devoured the earth.
[1:41:15] Amen. It's devoured people's emotions.
[1:41:18] Mental imbalances have come. All this
[1:41:20] trouble. Why? Cause uses fourth fourth
[1:41:23] fourth number four power
[1:41:26] has devoured the earth and destroyed
[1:41:28] this world. But there's one thing that
[1:41:31] can rebuild you. It's not self-help
[1:41:33] books. It's not mind over matter. It's
[1:41:36] not some self-improvement seven steps to
[1:41:38] become a better person. No. Let the
[1:41:40] truth come in. Let Christ come in. Amen.
[1:41:43] He'll rebuild your mind, rebuild your
[1:41:46] spirit. He'll rebuild your emotions.
[1:41:48] He'll rebuild your body. He'll rebuild
[1:41:50] your thinking. Amen. He'll transform
[1:41:52] your life. Let him come in. Amen. And
[1:41:55] undo what the devour's done. Amen. You
[1:41:57] want a peace of mind? Let the prince of
[1:41:59] peace come in. That's more than a
[1:42:01] catchphrase. That's reality. I remember
[1:42:03] being depressed for about three odd
[1:42:05] years, lost in the world. But when this
[1:42:07] word found me, when he found me, he
[1:42:09] said, "Cuz I want cuz he want to he me
[1:42:11] from the system. he me from gaming and
[1:42:13] and and clubbing and being at pubs and
[1:42:15] all the nonsense of the world as a young
[1:42:17] person. He wanted to he me from it and
[1:42:19] bring me into his kingdom. I tell you
[1:42:21] what, I've never regretted it. I've
[1:42:23] never said that was a bad idea. I've
[1:42:25] never said, "Well, I wish I could get
[1:42:27] out of it. I just want to get more into
[1:42:28] it."
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? Because he has moved
[1:42:32] me.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Glory into the kingdom of his dear son.
[1:42:36] Where there's peace ever more, there's
[1:42:38] overcoming power. There's joy. I tell
[1:42:40] you what friends, we got a resource. I
[1:42:42] mean, this world is talking about the
[1:42:44] guns and bombs and drones that can
[1:42:45] manufacture to defeat Russia and all
[1:42:47] these things and vice vice versa. We got
[1:42:50] a greater resource than that. Amen. We
[1:42:52] got a greater resource. We got the
[1:42:53] kingdom of heaven. Amen. Behind you and
[1:42:56] I that when the enemy comes in like a
[1:42:58] flood, he says, "I'll raise up a
[1:42:59] standard." What is that? The promises of
[1:43:00] God more alive, more real to you.
[1:43:03] Hallelujah.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; We ain't hopeless. We ain't helpless.
[1:43:09] There's no problem too big. You say,
[1:43:10] "Well, the world's fallen apart." That
[1:43:12] doesn't mean you have to.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to somebody. You You don't
[1:43:16] have to fall apart. You don't have to
[1:43:17] float with the tide. No, you can let God
[1:43:19] he out of this world. Bring him in,
[1:43:22] bring you into Christ that you're not
[1:43:23] just floating along. And I remember what
[1:43:25] it was like to float. But I remember
[1:43:26] what it was like when God said, "Hey,
[1:43:28] it's like he got the defibrillator of
[1:43:30] his spirit."
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Shocked me alive.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shocked me alive. I
[1:43:35] realized, man, I'm not meant to be
[1:43:36] floating. Amen. Then something in me
[1:43:38] started swimming, started walking with
[1:43:40] God.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; And that power is still present.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is still here. Hallelujah. So
[1:43:47] friends, don't float.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Let him bring you to life.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Let dry bones come alive today.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let him let him get a hold of your
[1:43:57] life. You say, "Can you really meet
[1:43:58] him?" Absolutely.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Who's had that experience? You raise
[1:44:01] your hand. I mean, maybe you're raised
[1:44:03] as a Christian, maybe. But then one day,
[1:44:05] the word came alive. I mean he he
[1:44:07] shocked you alive with his word. You
[1:44:09] realize, hey, I'm a son or daughter of
[1:44:10] God. I'm not part of this world. I may I
[1:44:13] may be in the world, but I'm not of the
[1:44:15] world.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; You know, sadly, many people try and
[1:44:18] make their mark on the world, but the
[1:44:19] world just marks them. Why not let the
[1:44:22] word mark you? Why not let him change
[1:44:24] you? And then you can really change the
[1:44:27] world.
[1:44:28] Let's have the musicians this morning.
[1:44:31] Let's just leave it there, shall we?
[1:44:33] Right. Aren't you glad? I I I wish I had
[1:44:35] a picture of it, but that stone, thank
[1:44:37] God I'm part of that stone, the Lord
[1:44:40] Jesus Christ.
[1:44:42] Hallelujah.
[1:44:47] And friends, I want to say if you're not
[1:44:48] part of it, you say, "Well, what's this
[1:44:50] all about?" Let him get a hold of you.
[1:44:53] Let him change you. Can he really do it?
[1:44:55] Absolutely.
[1:44:57] But don't just float with the tide.
[1:44:58] Well, everyone else is doing it. or
[1:45:01] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego had that
[1:45:03] same argument come into their minds.
[1:45:04] Well, everyone else is doing it. But
[1:45:06] they said, you know, Shadrach, what
[1:45:07] Abednego, we're not everyone else.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're not everyone else.
[1:45:11] We're a circumcised son of Abraham.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're under a covenant. Doesn't
[1:45:16] matter where we are. Remember, God is
[1:45:17] not just God in Israel. He's God
[1:45:18] everywhere. Hallelujah. And God is not
[1:45:21] just God in these four walls. He's God
[1:45:22] everywhere. Hallelujah. So, we're not
[1:45:25] just everyone else.
[1:45:27] Oh, I just need to find my
[1:45:28] individuality.
[1:45:30] It's amazing. People try and look for
[1:45:31] their own style, their own look. They
[1:45:33] end up looking like everyone else.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; I tried it. Trust me, I've been there.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Glad I don't have that t-shirt. Not that
[1:45:39] I'd buy it, but you know what I mean.
[1:45:41] Let's just walk with God.
[1:45:43] Praise the Lord. Let's stand this
[1:45:44] morning. I want to sing that song. I I
[1:45:46] know you sung it. Uh, thank God I'm

[1:45:50] you glad you're free?

[1:46:03] Amen.
[1:46:05] What's that?

[1:47:01] I sang low.

[1:48:07] that's taking his life.
[1:48:12] Like a blind man that God gave back his
[1:48:16] son.
[1:48:20] Like a poor beggar girl
[1:48:24] that found fortune and fame.

[1:55:34] in a word of prayer this morning. If you
[1:55:35] ought to be remembered in prayer, say,
[1:55:37] "Lord, cut me out of these things. Not
[1:55:38] be so engrossed by this stuff that's
[1:55:40] going on." Amen. Gracious Father, as we
[1:55:44] as I raise both my hands, Lord, just
[1:55:46] want to pray, dear God, as you said,
[1:55:48] we're in the world, but not of the
[1:55:49] world. Help us to walk, Lord, according
[1:55:51] to that, my God, that we're not caught
[1:55:53] up in troubles everywhere, Lord.
[1:55:56] different factions and movements and
[1:55:58] ideas and father it's just iron and clay
[1:56:00] my God partially broken and broken and
[1:56:03] Lord strong but weak and doesn't mix and
[1:56:06] polarizing ideas Lord Father in the name
[1:56:09] of Jesus Christ I want to thank you Lord
[1:56:10] you've sent a prophetic word to call us
[1:56:12] out Lord God you've sent a message to
[1:56:14] call us out of this confusion this
[1:56:16] Babylon Lord to walk with you Lord what
[1:56:18] a privilege it is the greatest thing in
[1:56:20] life is to know you and the power of
[1:56:21] your resurrection to walk with you my
[1:56:23] God so I pray father for everyone here.
[1:56:25] Those who are streaming, Lord, if they
[1:56:27] are entangled with these things that are
[1:56:29] going on, Lord, the religious, political
[1:56:31] moves and different things happening
[1:56:32] around the world. I pray that I just
[1:56:34] raise up their hands, say, "God,
[1:56:36] untangle me, Lord. I want to walk with
[1:56:38] you, Lord. I don't want to be caught up
[1:56:39] in these things. Oh God, I pray you'd be
[1:56:42] merciful, Father, in the name of Jesus
[1:56:44] Christ that we wouldn't be in our our
[1:56:46] hearts would not be intertwined with the
[1:56:48] with this world system in any way, but
[1:56:51] Lord, may it just be molded into one
[1:56:53] with you, Father, may you grant it. We
[1:56:55] love you so much. We commit the service
[1:56:57] and this time into your hands in Jesus
[1:56:59] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:57:02] Amen. God bless you. God bless you,
[1:57:04] Father Isa. I turn to you, bro. Amen.
[1:57:10] I sought the truth and men gave their
[1:57:15] answers.
[1:57:18] Something just wasn't right.
[1:57:24] I couldn't explain it. They sounded like
[1:57:29] strange.
[1:57:30] It just didn't meet my thirst inside.
[1:57:37] And I heard an eagle cry.
[1:57:40] I heard a word speak to my heart. He
[1:57:44] said, "Sh, you don't belong out there.
[1:57:48] Come up from where you are." Then I
[1:57:51] heard an eagle's cry.
[1:57:55] They told me I could fly. And I believe
[1:58:00] the word that I had heard and thought up
[1:58:04] to the sky. When I heard an eagle's cry.

[1:59:33] In every situation,
[1:59:37] whatever comes my way, I have a peace
[1:59:42] with Jesus flying above the stor.
[1:59:47] There is a joy within me. Now that I'm

[2:00:34] cry.
[2:00:36] You told me I could fly
[2:00:40] the word that I had heard
[2:00:44] up in the sky. When I heard an e cry,
[2:00:51] listen to the verse one more time before
[2:00:52] we dismiss. Then I heard an eagle's cry.
[2:00:57] I heard a word speak to my heart.
[2:01:01] said, "Child, you don't belong down
[2:01:04] there. Come up from where you are." Then
[2:01:09] I heard an eagle cry.
[2:01:13] It told me I could fly.
[2:01:16] And I believed the word that I had
[2:01:20] heard. And soar up to the sky when I
[2:01:24] heard an eagle cry.
[2:01:29] This is pray this morning.
