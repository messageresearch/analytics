[44:04] yeah the ministry we just want to commit
[44:06] to you in jesus name amen amen okay you
[44:09] can um take your seats again i'm
[44:11] actually going to have my seat because
[44:12] um
[44:14] we had a guard this last night and we
[44:17] decided that the way the computers the
[44:19] camera was
[44:20] this is a better um
[44:22] shot
[44:26] brother head was joking that it's my
[44:27] filmmaking
[44:29] stuff going into play but um
[44:31] in film if you do the camera low and you
[44:33] point up at someone it shows like that
[44:35] they've got this sort of they're a
[44:36] powerful person then they're looking
[44:38] down on the camera and when i stood up
[44:40] and looked down at the camera it looked
[44:41] like that and i was a bit put off right
[44:43] so i'm just going to um sit here
[44:45] and do it this way
[44:47] um
[44:48] the
[44:49] the message that i have on my heart
[44:52] today is a sermon called peace and i
[44:54] won't be
[44:55] as always i won't be telling you
[44:57] anything that you don't already know
[44:59] um
[45:00] i'm just going to be
[45:02] talking about things that you already
[45:03] know but i just sort of package it
[45:05] together a whole lot of
[45:06] a lot of things you know and put it
[45:08] together so
[45:09] um and we actually do have people here
[45:11] they're my family all hide from the
[45:13] camera but they're all like sitting
[45:14] there there's people there
[45:16] there's people david and everyone else
[45:18] they're over i'm sorry
[45:20] where are they
[45:22] they're all they're all there david's
[45:23] there everybody's here
[45:27] but
[45:27] they don't seem to like the camera
[45:31] don't blame them
[45:34] here we go now i can hear some people
[45:35] that's good amen let's get some a little
[45:38] bit of feedback okay so
[45:40] so now
[45:42] i'm going to go through this reasonably
[45:43] fast but brother you only did a short
[45:45] song service so he's actually left me
[45:47] with quite a bit of time which is good
[45:48] um
[45:49] the
[45:51] so the message is peace and it's a very
[45:53] powerful word peace and it's something
[45:55] that we all want
[45:57] i believe in our life is peace
[46:00] it's a it's a wonderful thing
[46:03] and when you have peace
[46:05] we're really happy who enjoys peace
[46:08] peace is good i'm always very grateful
[46:11] and i've got peace i'm always very very
[46:13] grateful because i know that it's a
[46:15] blessing of god that we can have peace
[46:18] so that's what i want to speak about but
[46:20] but
[46:21] in order to get where i'm going with my
[46:24] um
[46:25] thought
[46:29] i've got modern technology this
[46:31] microphone is set up that when i tap it
[46:32] the slide changes miraculously
[46:39] [Laughter]
[46:42] yeah um
[46:43] but in order to talk about peace
[46:46] we have to acknowledge that the time
[46:48] that we are living in now
[46:49] is
[46:51] definitely not a time of peace
[46:55] across the board we are
[46:57] living in a time of war and
[47:00] like if i had a program of the way that
[47:02] things were happening i would look at
[47:04] the program and say okay so now at this
[47:06] time we have a time of war or if i
[47:07] looked at the season that we were in i
[47:09] would say okay at the moment it's a
[47:10] season of war
[47:12] and
[47:13] no amount of um
[47:17] whether it be a natural war united
[47:19] nations deliberations or whether it be
[47:21] conflicts between people or conflicts
[47:23] between
[47:24] anybody
[47:25] there's actually
[47:27] no amount of
[47:29] of energy or effort that we could put in
[47:31] will actually stop this from being a
[47:33] time of war
[47:34] amen
[47:36] we don't we've gone to the point where
[47:39] this is what we we will we will reap
[47:41] what we've sown we as in humans
[47:44] mankind not not the bride but mankind
[47:47] it's just it's the season that we're in
[47:48] there is there is nothing that we can do
[47:50] to get out of this or
[47:52] try and work out some big plan
[47:54] politicians and everybody will try and
[47:55] work out plans and schools and
[47:57] everything will try and teach people a
[47:58] certain way to be peaceful but that
[48:01] it actually won't happen that way
[48:03] because this is now the season that
[48:04] we're in this is all that's on the
[48:06] program is
[48:07] a time of war
[48:12] i've got a scripture here and you shall
[48:13] hear of wars and rumors of wars see that
[48:15] you've been not troubled for all these
[48:17] things must come to pass but the end is
[48:19] not yet
[48:20] and i just gathered a few photos there
[48:24] to show examples of
[48:27] the fact that
[48:29] even though we have enjoyed a relative
[48:31] time of natural peace for a while we
[48:33] have actually
[48:34] mankind have just got a
[48:36] thing about fighting wars and we just
[48:39] we we have wars for all different
[48:41] reasons but there's a there are a few
[48:42] photos there that show
[48:44] war and conflict that only in the last
[48:46] 100 years that man have been in and if
[48:48] you study history
[48:49] there have been a lot of conflicts but
[48:51] there haven't there hasn't been a time
[48:53] where there has been so much conflict
[48:55] in general as what we are engaged
[48:58] what we're engaged in now
[49:00] um
[49:04] it works
[49:05] but there are always reasons why things
[49:07] happen there's a reason why this is a
[49:09] season of war it doesn't just happen and
[49:10] we and there's no no
[49:13] it's not the result of some um
[49:16] action or it's not a consequence we
[49:18] always live in consequences i was
[49:20] overhearing sister letabo's um sunday
[49:23] school lesson this morning and she
[49:24] talked about consequences and we are
[49:27] right now we are we are as a world we
[49:30] are living in the
[49:31] in consequences
[49:33] um for what we've done
[49:36] as mankind you know and the path that
[49:38] collected that generally we've chosen to
[49:40] take now not us as a as
[49:43] sons and daughters of god but the world
[49:45] in general and has chosen to take a
[49:47] certain path and
[49:50] um
[49:50] and it's also a
[49:52] time that is going to be like this
[49:54] anyway but there are reasons why things
[49:56] are like how they are it doesn't just
[49:57] happen and we can't understand the
[49:59] reason why it doesn't just spring upon
[50:00] us and we say well i didn't know that
[50:01] was
[50:02] gonna happen like this that's right we
[50:04] can
[50:05] we can understand by the wisdom of god
[50:07] and by his word why we can understand
[50:09] why things are happening a certain way
[50:11] so there are two reasons if you really
[50:13] boil it down there are two reasons why
[50:15] we are in a time of war the first one is
[50:18] is because it's a it's
[50:20] it's a
[50:21] uniting time a dividing time and a
[50:23] harvest time they all sound like they
[50:25] are different things but they all
[50:28] uh
[50:29] correlate back together
[50:31] you can bring that back up yep there you
[50:33] go
[50:34] um
[50:35] not that you tried to bring it down but
[50:38] they all correlate together these th
[50:40] this idea or this this
[50:42] thought uniting time and dividing time
[50:44] and harvest time they're actually all
[50:45] relatively talking about the same thing
[50:47] and and within that
[50:48] within that reason there you get a lot
[50:50] of conflict in that reason and i'll take
[50:52] you through that um
[50:55] next but
[50:57] the other reason why is because the
[51:00] second reason why is because the world's
[51:01] rejected the prince of peace
[51:04] and now we are governed by what i'm
[51:06] going to call the prince of war yeah
[51:08] that the governing power that man has
[51:10] chosen to rule over them
[51:12] is is
[51:14] is not a prince of peace
[51:16] he desires
[51:18] war that's right and that's
[51:20] satan his kingdom of darkness desires
[51:22] war he desires conflict that's all that
[51:25] he knows he doesn't know peace he
[51:26] doesn't know how to
[51:27] create peace and create an environment
[51:29] where people are happy and at peace that
[51:30] he doesn't that that's non-existent in
[51:32] his
[51:33] and his
[51:34] um when he plans his schemes
[51:37] so
[51:39] the more he rules the more we will get
[51:40] conflict in every every area of life now
[51:43] you'll see when i go through this that
[51:44] i'm not talking about guys getting out
[51:46] and guys and girls getting out guns and
[51:48] shooting each other there is more to war
[51:50] and conflict than just that although
[51:52] that is going to be part of
[51:54] the conflict in some places
[51:56] some places are at war without people
[51:57] firing shots but there's this conflict
[51:59] in this war that's right
[52:01] so
[52:05] um i want to start off with this thought
[52:07] about it being a uniting time in a
[52:09] dividing time and a harvest time which
[52:11] all correlate to
[52:12] war or conflict
[52:15] luke 21
[52:16] verse 29 to 31 says and he spoke to them
[52:18] a parable behold the fig tree and all
[52:20] the trees
[52:21] when they now shoot forth you see
[52:23] and know of your own selves that summer
[52:25] is night hand so likewise when you see
[52:27] these things come to pass know ye that
[52:28] the kingdom of god is nigh at hand
[52:31] so
[52:32] we know that the fig tree is talking
[52:34] about israel
[52:36] when it's becoming
[52:37] um when it's becoming a nation again and
[52:39] it's blossoming again and it's becoming
[52:41] something
[52:44] when we see that then we know okay the
[52:46] end is not at hand when we see it
[52:47] starting to to come forth and become
[52:49] everything that it was designed to be
[52:52] um but in the scripture it says behold
[52:55] the fig tree and all the trees
[52:57] so there's a time when israel
[52:59] starts coming into being and starts to
[53:01] grow but at the same time everything is
[53:04] doing the same thing because it's
[53:05] becoming into a harvest time so
[53:07] that before that
[53:10] this is an important factor fact but
[53:15] that
[53:18] i want to explain it like this
[53:21] is
[53:23] where
[53:24] the world essentially was in a season
[53:26] like what you see here these trees that
[53:27] they're all kind of the same there's not
[53:29] too much difference between them when
[53:30] they don't have any leaves when you
[53:31] can't quite see what they are
[53:33] they just look like this you know
[53:34] there's
[53:35] there's a certain degree of unity i
[53:37] suppose you could say
[53:39] when you look at this they nothing
[53:41] really stands out from the other unless
[53:43] you're an arborist then you understand
[53:44] trees
[53:45] you can maybe
[53:46] maybe there are three or four different
[53:47] trees in this and you can say that tree
[53:48] is this that tree is that but if you
[53:50] didn't generally know that
[53:52] trees very well you could look at a
[53:55] bunch of trees like this and you
[53:56] wouldn't really know what they are and
[53:58] they're none of them are standing out
[53:59] one from another or or
[54:01] none of them are making any bold
[54:03] statements because it's all just
[54:04] branches and
[54:05] that no no leaves no fruit you can't
[54:07] quite see what they are and
[54:09] when when the world
[54:10] before israel started to burden that the
[54:13] world essentially is looking like this
[54:14] so there's not this ability for a whole
[54:17] lot of differences because it's just
[54:19] they're all kind of looking like this so
[54:20] within this you could say
[54:22] within the state you don't really have
[54:23] much
[54:24] difference there's not much bold
[54:26] statements and people and nations and
[54:29] everything becoming what they are
[54:31] um
[54:33] but if we go if we see i want to give an
[54:35] example like like this tree here
[54:38] things are quite quiet when it's the
[54:40] tree on the right with no leaves in that
[54:42] it's quite a quiet time in terms of
[54:44] there's nothing pushing forth and making
[54:47] statements but when you get to a point
[54:49] where there are leaves and there's
[54:51] everything's pushing forth it's a loud
[54:53] it's a bold time you understand like
[54:55] there it's a time where everything is
[54:57] becoming what it is
[54:59] so that means good and that means evil
[55:01] they're becoming what they are in a
[55:03] powerful way
[55:04] and as a result of that you start to get
[55:08] differences start to get shown
[55:10] and conflicts start because things are
[55:12] expressing themselves more what they are
[55:16] so that's
[55:18] because we're coming into that time
[55:20] everything whether it be good or whether
[55:21] it be evil is now pushing out powerfully
[55:25] more than what it ever was because it's
[55:27] it's it's this time it's a things are
[55:29] coming forth it's a harvest time
[55:32] um and differences in this scenario
[55:37] if you don't have to be an arborist to
[55:38] look at it look at the bunch of trees
[55:40] that and say well that's an apple tree
[55:41] that's a because i see an apple on it
[55:43] that's a
[55:44] fig tree because i see a fig on it
[55:45] that's a pine tree because i kind of
[55:47] know the pine needles the way that
[55:48] that's they they're not just the newest
[55:50] but
[55:51] you understand they become more apparent
[55:53] and things are expressing themselves a
[55:54] lot more
[55:56] um
[55:57] and
[55:59] also in this harvest time
[56:02] it's a dividing time in terms of
[56:05] when jesus talked about it he said that
[56:07] you know when the tears were sowed
[56:08] amongst the wheat they all grew together
[56:10] there was a time where they were all
[56:11] growing together
[56:13] and although you kind of knew they were
[56:15] different they all could dwell together
[56:16] and grow together and without too much
[56:20] fuss i suppose you could say there
[56:21] wasn't too much conflict they were just
[56:23] all let to grow when it rained
[56:25] they would all be
[56:26] blessed together because the rain would
[56:27] come and all the wheat would grow but
[56:29] the tears would grow as well because
[56:30] it's raining this is nice i can grow
[56:33] each one could grow together and you
[56:35] couldn't really tell one from the other
[56:36] essentially they were all sort of mixed
[56:38] everything was just growing
[56:40] and you could say they were all kind of
[56:42] getting along to a degree because they
[56:43] were just all
[56:45] doing around about the same thing it's a
[56:47] there was a time when it was like that
[56:49] but at the end time
[56:51] there's a separation starts to happen
[56:54] and that's why jesus said you know
[56:56] at the end gather the tears together and
[56:59] bind them up and put them over here and
[57:01] take the wheat and put it this way so
[57:03] start to separate everything
[57:05] so now they become this starts to become
[57:08] when things separate there you start to
[57:10] see the differences you realize okay now
[57:12] that's wheat and that's tear it's
[57:15] it becomes there are differences which
[57:17] create that starts to create conflict
[57:19] because
[57:20] before that they when everything is the
[57:22] same there's not really conflict that
[57:23] they're just all the same it's just
[57:25] going together but when things start to
[57:26] separate
[57:27] yeah and bind together
[57:29] the the
[57:30] the the
[57:33] it creates a betting ground for conflict
[57:35] you understand what i mean it starts to
[57:37] things are starting to at one on one
[57:39] hand show what they are they're starting
[57:40] to fruit so this that and that's
[57:42] different than that that's different
[57:43] than that
[57:44] um things are being bound together and
[57:46] being separated and it's creating
[57:48] conflict
[57:52] um there's a scripture here that says we
[57:55] were false prophets which come to you in
[57:56] sheep's clothing but immediately they
[57:57] are ravening wolves you shall know them
[57:59] by their fruits do men gather grapes of
[58:01] thorns or figs of thistles
[58:03] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[58:05] good fruit but a corrupt tree brings
[58:07] forth corrupt fruit
[58:09] so
[58:10] this goes along with what i was saying
[58:12] about
[58:13] the fact that
[58:18] next one i'll just bring you this next
[58:19] one
[58:22] when we get in this harvest time
[58:25] things are manifest what they are
[58:26] there's no hiding now what they are
[58:28] that's a it's a fig tree there's fruit
[58:29] and it's also coming into bed
[58:32] so
[58:33] we have we have a climax i've written it
[58:35] here it's the climax or expression for a
[58:37] tree or a plant it's it's it's finals
[58:40] it's a final expression of what it is
[58:42] it's fruit because after when it when a
[58:44] tree will grow and bear fruit it bears
[58:46] all this wonderful fruit and then it
[58:47] actually then it dies that's the end of
[58:49] it because it wants to
[58:50] once you put more life forth because all
[58:52] this life is on the seed and then it
[58:54] drops the fruit off and then hopefully
[58:56] someone eats that piece of fruit and
[58:57] they walk away and throw the apple
[58:59] somewhere else and then the seed grows
[59:00] there it wants to it wants to spread out
[59:02] this god's way of getting
[59:03] the trees to multiply
[59:07] but
[59:07] at the same time it's so it's a climax
[59:10] of everything that's in the tree it
[59:11] wants to come out at the end it's a it
[59:13] expresses itself
[59:15] and
[59:16] we are in this time where not only are
[59:18] things being separated and divided but
[59:20] everything is being separated
[59:22] and showing what it is and expressing
[59:24] itself and it's it's creating a lot of
[59:27] conflict
[59:28] now
[59:29] i've got this to give an example of how
[59:31] this idea works in mankind god knows
[59:35] that the human psyche operates like this
[59:36] because
[59:38] when man all spoke one language and they
[59:40] were building the tower of babel
[59:42] because a man they live men and women
[59:46] live for a long time so they could
[59:47] acquire a lot of knowledge that back
[59:49] then
[59:51] that was one especially but also but the
[59:52] other aspect was they were they could
[59:54] they all spoke the same language so they
[59:56] all got on together because they were
[59:57] all of one there wasn't anything
[1:00:00] separating them so they could easily get
[1:00:02] along and you could say there wasn't any
[1:00:03] conflict amongst them because
[1:00:05] they had the same culture
[1:00:07] disputes could be resolved
[1:00:09] i would say relatively easily because
[1:00:11] they could all talk about it they
[1:00:12] understood each other they were all of
[1:00:14] one
[1:00:15] and
[1:00:17] when god went down he said let's go down
[1:00:19] and see them and he said because they
[1:00:20] all speak the same language there and
[1:00:22] they've got the same culture essentially
[1:00:24] they're all one people and now they can
[1:00:26] work together and and do these sorts of
[1:00:28] things
[1:00:29] so
[1:00:31] so god had to find a way to separate
[1:00:33] them so that they wouldn't all be able
[1:00:35] to work together
[1:00:36] and
[1:00:38] and that they would they would separate
[1:00:40] and
[1:00:41] so what he did was
[1:00:43] he
[1:00:44] he mixed up all the language and made
[1:00:45] them all speak a different language so
[1:00:47] you can imagine in the aftermath of all
[1:00:49] that
[1:00:50] everyone had to talk and talk and talk
[1:00:52] until they
[1:00:54] they suddenly encountered someone that
[1:00:56] they no longer got along with because
[1:00:57] they couldn't communicate
[1:00:59] and
[1:01:00] while they may have known that person
[1:01:01] yesterday as john they couldn't now now
[1:01:03] i couldn't communicate with john so the
[1:01:05] next day they wouldn't have had so much
[1:01:06] conflict with them because they knew
[1:01:07] still john they just couldn't talk to
[1:01:09] him but they would have started to go
[1:01:11] towards gravitate towards people that
[1:01:12] they could speak to when they heard
[1:01:14] their language being spoken they would
[1:01:15] be they would think hey use the same
[1:01:17] language as me let's let's now team up
[1:01:20] you know i'll spend time with you i
[1:01:22] won't spend time with john anymore even
[1:01:23] though maybe john was as
[1:01:25] maybe
[1:01:26] he doesn't want to hang out with john
[1:01:28] anymore because he can't talk to john he
[1:01:29] wants he will go and spend time with the
[1:01:31] people he can that that is right
[1:01:33] like-minded like him
[1:01:35] and
[1:01:35] then over time
[1:01:37] this was actually the start of all of
[1:01:38] our conflict over time these people
[1:01:39] separated they began to move away
[1:01:42] because they thought i just don't get on
[1:01:43] with john and his people anymore i can't
[1:01:44] talk to them i don't understand them
[1:01:46] and as time went on they started to form
[1:01:48] their own culture and their own way of
[1:01:49] doing things
[1:01:51] and suddenly john formed his own culture
[1:01:53] and his own way of doing things with his
[1:01:54] people when you started having
[1:01:55] differences and within that
[1:01:58] that's why we have all the wars and
[1:02:00] differences we have today is because
[1:02:01] people don't understand
[1:02:02] they don't understand the language they
[1:02:04] don't understand the culture they think
[1:02:05] these guys are scheming something funny
[1:02:07] about us but we don't know what it is
[1:02:08] because we don't understand them you
[1:02:09] know that's that that was
[1:02:11] that started to create a conflict
[1:02:14] but
[1:02:14] it was through the through people
[1:02:16] separating and showing and becoming
[1:02:18] something different that
[1:02:19] conflict starts
[1:02:21] that was an example of what's happening
[1:02:23] today
[1:02:25] and that's why the scripture says can
[1:02:26] two walk together except they be agreed
[1:02:29] but now because everyone's ideas are
[1:02:31] fruiting
[1:02:33] it's hard for people to walk together
[1:02:34] now because everyone's ideas are
[1:02:36] showing what they are in a loud way this
[1:02:39] is my idea this is this idea this is
[1:02:41] that one it's loud and there's there's
[1:02:43] this you've got a situation where people
[1:02:44] can't
[1:02:46] walk together because and it's creating
[1:02:49] conflict that's right and
[1:02:52] i've got this one here that every idea
[1:02:55] every set in every belief everything is
[1:02:58] fully fruiting now of what it is
[1:03:01] everything it's becoming powerful
[1:03:04] and as a result enemies and friends are
[1:03:06] appearing that's like oh he speaks my
[1:03:08] language i will team up with him
[1:03:10] they don't i don't like them these are
[1:03:13] my people here that's not my people
[1:03:14] there whereas one day before that these
[1:03:16] were my people it was
[1:03:17] we were all friends but now it's
[1:03:19] now there's a separation happening
[1:03:21] between a lot of people a lot of sex and
[1:03:23] everything
[1:03:24] and ideas
[1:03:25] and
[1:03:26] it's you've got this betting ground for
[1:03:28] conflict and it's what's happening now
[1:03:31] is there's a there is conflict and war
[1:03:34] starting between all these different
[1:03:35] factions in the world that's the that's
[1:03:37] the hour that we live in and it's only
[1:03:39] getting worse these are
[1:03:41] we are becoming the world is it becoming
[1:03:43] a divided and divisive place
[1:03:46] and everyone is being separated out now
[1:03:48] i've got this little picture here
[1:03:50] this is to make fun of it but this is
[1:03:52] what is actually happening you know if
[1:03:54] we all if you put yourself in a room
[1:03:56] full of about 200 people and you gave
[1:03:58] everyone a different color hat some were
[1:04:00] pink some were blue some are red some
[1:04:02] are orange some are black
[1:04:04] you would for some strange reason you
[1:04:06] would think you hadn't if you had a
[1:04:07] black hat on you had to keep the black
[1:04:08] hat on you would you would seem to think
[1:04:10] for some reason you have an affiliation
[1:04:11] with the people with the black hat on
[1:04:13] like okay that uh we must be kind of the
[1:04:15] same group because you've got a black
[1:04:16] hat on so away yeah yeah if you ever got
[1:04:19] a black cat and you're gonna mix all the
[1:04:20] people with the red hat it's like uh
[1:04:21] well
[1:04:22] i'm always the guy with the black hat
[1:04:24] you guys always the people with the red
[1:04:25] hat i'm kind of like this is different
[1:04:26] you know like
[1:04:28] and and if the yellow people if the
[1:04:30] yellow people did something to
[1:04:32] the yellow hat there's something people
[1:04:34] with the black hat on then you would
[1:04:35] suddenly
[1:04:36] fear you would have now
[1:04:38] an indifference towards the people with
[1:04:40] the yellow hat but that may have just
[1:04:42] been a little conflict between one
[1:04:43] unique person with the yellow and one
[1:04:44] unique person with the black but because
[1:04:46] you've got a black hat you'd think oh
[1:04:48] well i'm now i've got a conflict with
[1:04:50] the yellow hat people because one of
[1:04:51] their people did this to the black cat
[1:04:53] people yeah
[1:04:54] yeah
[1:04:56] it sounds silly but this is
[1:04:58] and and the way that satan has
[1:05:00] devised it now as well is to put people
[1:05:04] to give people different hats and to get
[1:05:07] people into different
[1:05:08] to to convince people you're part of
[1:05:10] this group you're part of that you're
[1:05:11] part of that to create a conflict that's
[1:05:13] part of his his plan of creating
[1:05:15] conflict
[1:05:16] like when
[1:05:17] when god
[1:05:18] comes down and preaches his word he says
[1:05:20] that we're all one in christ and in the
[1:05:22] in the believers in the body of christ
[1:05:24] there's this concept that we're all one
[1:05:25] and christ is unity in the body of
[1:05:27] christ but
[1:05:29] there has been no time in the world
[1:05:30] where there's so much disunity among
[1:05:32] people because they've all been given
[1:05:34] different hats and they've they've all
[1:05:35] been labeled certain ways you you must
[1:05:37] be if you think that you must be this
[1:05:38] group then if you think that you must be
[1:05:40] in that group and there's a there's
[1:05:41] conflict
[1:05:43] starting to arise
[1:05:44] in a powerful way
[1:05:46] very powerful um right
[1:05:48] okay that's that is what's happening and
[1:05:51] you'll see it happening more and more as
[1:05:53] as time goes on you'll see you'll see
[1:05:54] times where there once was no conflict
[1:05:56] between groups
[1:05:58] or
[1:05:58] peoples there's now conflict and and
[1:06:00] separation between them and between
[1:06:03] ideas and the people are becoming
[1:06:04] separated to their own groups
[1:06:07] and
[1:06:08] the second the second powerful reason is
[1:06:10] because
[1:06:11] people have rejected the prince of peace
[1:06:14] now i've got this
[1:06:16] we can easily say this but
[1:06:19] that's that's
[1:06:21] it's more than just a sentence oh we've
[1:06:22] done that therefore we get this
[1:06:25] it's a it's a very powerful thing
[1:06:26] because we get governed by ideas yeah
[1:06:29] that's
[1:06:30] and when we surrender our life to the
[1:06:32] lord and we let the holy ghost come and
[1:06:34] lead our life we get governed by his
[1:06:36] ideas and and then we then
[1:06:38] live out his ideas
[1:06:40] we might say don't steal so then we go
[1:06:42] out to society and we don't steal you
[1:06:44] know or we
[1:06:45] we say to be kind to one another and
[1:06:48] love one another so when we we're
[1:06:49] governed by that idea then we go out to
[1:06:50] society and we we live that out through
[1:06:52] society right but but when we reject the
[1:06:55] prince of peace
[1:06:56] then we get governed by
[1:06:59] the when you reject light
[1:07:01] you get
[1:07:02] governed by darkness by default
[1:07:05] i've just got this here about peace
[1:07:06] peace is an attribute of god
[1:07:08] galatians 5 22 says but the but the
[1:07:11] fruit of the spirit is love joy and
[1:07:13] peace long suffering given us goodness
[1:07:15] faith meekness temperance it's part of
[1:07:17] the the attribute of god when we have
[1:07:20] when when mankind gets god in their
[1:07:22] heart they will
[1:07:23] by default have this desire for peace as
[1:07:25] a general idea i just like photos like
[1:07:28] this because i could just imagine this
[1:07:29] nice family going along to church and
[1:07:31] the dad would always be teaching
[1:07:34] good values to his children and saying
[1:07:35] you know you want to be peaceful and all
[1:07:37] this
[1:07:38] and the mum will be doing the same and
[1:07:39] you create awesome people in society
[1:07:41] that go out and
[1:07:42] and
[1:07:43] shine the light of god in society and
[1:07:44] make the world a better place that's
[1:07:46] right what you get
[1:07:48] and i
[1:07:50] and
[1:07:51] you know there's a scripture that says
[1:07:53] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:07:54] shall be called the children of god and
[1:07:56] i believe that sons and daughters of god
[1:07:57] are peacemakers when you get into a
[1:07:59] situation you desire for there to be
[1:08:01] peace you don't desire conflict we don't
[1:08:03] desire to have conflict in fighting we
[1:08:05] desire peace
[1:08:07] i've got this picture here because i can
[1:08:08] often think about you know armies that
[1:08:11] are a war for some silly reason and some
[1:08:13] and someone comes up with an idea to
[1:08:16] somehow create peace and he says i want
[1:08:17] to go and go and see that army and see
[1:08:20] if we can't work out and i want to go
[1:08:21] with terms of peace that we can work out
[1:08:23] our differences without having this big
[1:08:24] conflict
[1:08:25] peacemakers and
[1:08:27] that god values people that are
[1:08:29] peacemakers if you want to be anything
[1:08:30] in your life be a peacemaker amen the
[1:08:32] peacemakers if you want to be called a
[1:08:33] child of god then be a peacemaker
[1:08:36] now going on to this
[1:08:39] essentially what we have said
[1:08:41] what we have said to is that we want to
[1:08:44] turn the light off you know because god
[1:08:46] is light and his light shines in it it's
[1:08:49] he's love but he's also light and he
[1:08:51] shines the light on things and it keeps
[1:08:52] everything
[1:08:54] okay
[1:08:55] what we've said now is turn the light
[1:08:56] off we don't want light anymore mankind
[1:08:59] says turn the light off
[1:09:00] i want to explain
[1:09:02] it doesn't matter how how smart we think
[1:09:04] we are how great we think our ideas are
[1:09:07] in society and how we think we're going
[1:09:08] to excel with this progressive idea
[1:09:11] if you turn the lights off you get
[1:09:13] darkness
[1:09:14] it doesn't matter what you think it's
[1:09:15] going to be you get darkness and then
[1:09:17] darkness there's confusion and darkness
[1:09:19] you don't know where you're going
[1:09:20] darkness has a
[1:09:21] the opposite attributes of light it
[1:09:23] doesn't matter which way mankind tries
[1:09:25] to play it
[1:09:27] what we've what we're asking for is
[1:09:29] turning the lights on now if you look at
[1:09:30] these pictures here i've got a whole
[1:09:31] bunch of people in light the people are
[1:09:33] still there in the other picture i just
[1:09:35] put a bit of an opaque dark color over
[1:09:38] them but they're all still there but
[1:09:39] they're all now in darkness
[1:09:42] and that's what the
[1:09:43] if you look closely you can probably see
[1:09:44] a few other people there they're all
[1:09:46] still there i want to read you some
[1:09:47] scriptures
[1:09:49] about what happens
[1:09:51] to mankind when we when we turn off the
[1:09:53] lights now the works of the flesh are
[1:09:54] manifest which are these adultery
[1:09:56] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[1:09:58] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[1:10:01] wrath strife suggestions heresies
[1:10:03] envyings murders drunkenness revelings
[1:10:06] and such like
[1:10:09] now
[1:10:11] the world can just wait and see what
[1:10:12] happens when you turn the light out this
[1:10:13] is what happens
[1:10:14] i'm not making this up just let it let
[1:10:17] it play out and you'll see and with
[1:10:18] hatred wrath and strife and murders
[1:10:20] you're going to get conflict you're not
[1:10:22] going to have peace
[1:10:24] that's why we're going to have
[1:10:25] as civilized as man thinks they are
[1:10:27] we're going to get more and more
[1:10:28] conflict
[1:10:29] sam says draw me not away or you can go
[1:10:31] to the next one yep sam says draw me not
[1:10:32] away with the wicked and with the
[1:10:33] workers of iniquity which speak peace to
[1:10:36] their neighbors but mischief is in their
[1:10:37] hearts
[1:10:38] they're saying we want peace but really
[1:10:40] they they're after some sort of conflict
[1:10:42] they're out to do their neighbor wrong
[1:10:44] in some way
[1:10:45] and
[1:10:46] that's what's in the heart that's what
[1:10:48] is in the heart of darkness so
[1:10:51] people are saying one thing but they
[1:10:52] their objective is to do another thing
[1:10:56] that's where we're at at the moment i've
[1:10:57] got some scriptures more scriptures
[1:10:58] about
[1:11:00] about this concept that when we have
[1:11:01] darkness we have war we have we're not
[1:11:03] going to have peace let them that are my
[1:11:05] enemies wrongfully
[1:11:07] let not them that are my enemies
[1:11:08] wrongfully rejoice over me neither let
[1:11:10] them wink with the eye that hate me
[1:11:11] without a cause
[1:11:12] for they speak not peace
[1:11:14] but they devise
[1:11:16] deceitful matters against them that are
[1:11:17] quiet in the land
[1:11:19] a peacemaker doesn't sit down and desire
[1:11:22] ways that he could have a conflict and
[1:11:23] have war he desires ways that he can
[1:11:25] have more peace but but
[1:11:27] when people start to dwell in darkness
[1:11:28] they sit back and desire ways that they
[1:11:30] could actually cause a conflict when
[1:11:32] there isn't a conflict there now that
[1:11:34] doesn't mean they go up and pick up arms
[1:11:36] and go and shoot people but you see in
[1:11:38] this society people will just stir up a
[1:11:39] conflict between people for no
[1:11:42] particular you think why would you do
[1:11:43] that you're just steering up a conflict
[1:11:45] why not have peace but that's an
[1:11:47] attribute of darkness
[1:11:49] now these people might stand up and say
[1:11:51] i want peace i don't want war and
[1:11:52] they're talking about natural war and
[1:11:53] yet they'll go
[1:11:54] at war with their neighbor
[1:11:56] in an instant i've got this next one
[1:11:58] here
[1:11:59] but he that is void of wisdom despiseth
[1:12:02] his neighbor
[1:12:03] but a man of understanding holdeth his
[1:12:06] peace
[1:12:07] and
[1:12:09] where the fear of god is the beginning
[1:12:10] of wisdom so as we start as man starts
[1:12:12] to go away from god then he is just
[1:12:14] going to despise his neighbor and cause
[1:12:16] conflict
[1:12:17] just because that's all that he knows
[1:12:19] how to do because when you dwell in
[1:12:20] darkness that's that's the that's what
[1:12:22] we get
[1:12:23] now
[1:12:26] i got this this quote here
[1:12:28] and it's it's it's relevant
[1:12:32] in a sense
[1:12:34] i'll just read it it's a it's a quote
[1:12:36] from ronald reagan and he said we
[1:12:37] maintain the peace
[1:12:40] through
[1:12:42] our strength
[1:12:44] weakness only invites aggression so that
[1:12:46] was what ronald reagan's big idea was
[1:12:48] peace
[1:12:49] through strength right
[1:12:51] and
[1:12:52] but but his
[1:12:54] his idea being that
[1:12:56] this only works when the person that
[1:12:58] wants to be the strongest desires peace
[1:13:00] right yeah
[1:13:01] because he desires peace he's saying
[1:13:03] well the way we get peace is if we be
[1:13:05] strong and we build up a good economy
[1:13:07] and a big army and we are a powerful
[1:13:09] nation
[1:13:11] that desires peace so that if someone
[1:13:13] else in the world is going wants to have
[1:13:15] a war we can step in and say say no
[1:13:17] don't have a war you know and they will
[1:13:19] listen to us because we are powerful
[1:13:21] that's what he meant by that peace
[1:13:23] through strength is like you know oh
[1:13:24] this next one this essentially it's this
[1:13:27] one here you know to put it in simple
[1:13:28] terms what he's meaning is we want to be
[1:13:30] the biggest guys in playground and then
[1:13:32] so we can keep all the other guys under
[1:13:34] control now this concept works if you
[1:13:38] it works both ways like if if if he
[1:13:41] desires to if he is a genuine peacemaker
[1:13:43] then this is a great
[1:13:45] scenario
[1:13:46] you know you have this and i think
[1:13:49] i think that the
[1:13:51] the the american culture
[1:13:53] was godly and did desire peace so there
[1:13:56] was
[1:13:57] although there were all sorts of
[1:13:59] mess-ups here and there i think in
[1:14:00] general there was this desire that okay
[1:14:02] if we're strong we will we will we want
[1:14:04] peace
[1:14:04] that was the general the world has
[1:14:06] enjoyed
[1:14:07] a good season of peace because there has
[1:14:09] been a big strong person in the
[1:14:10] playground that wants peace right
[1:14:12] because you get you get this one here
[1:14:15] when the righteous are an authority
[1:14:18] the people rejoice but when the wicked
[1:14:19] beareth rule the people mourn
[1:14:21] the same could go the opposite you know
[1:14:23] you could have oppression through
[1:14:24] strength you know because if the
[1:14:25] strongest person in the room is an
[1:14:27] oppressor then
[1:14:28] you're going to have the opposite effect
[1:14:30] you're not going to get peace you're
[1:14:31] going to get war and oppression once
[1:14:32] he's taken over you he's going to
[1:14:34] oppress you
[1:14:35] and
[1:14:36] so that
[1:14:37] that concept has worked well peace
[1:14:39] through strength but unfortunately the
[1:14:41] evil is rising up now that they're
[1:14:43] becoming the stronger force in the world
[1:14:45] in countries
[1:14:46] countries that don't desire peace
[1:14:48] oppressive countries are becoming more
[1:14:50] and more powerful
[1:14:51] and they are starting to
[1:14:53] tip the balance of power and as a result
[1:14:54] you're going to start to see global
[1:14:57] unrest because there's
[1:14:58] there are there's evil rising up
[1:15:01] not saying that that america is good
[1:15:03] it's not because that that would be the
[1:15:04] wrong
[1:15:05] way to put it
[1:15:06] you know because i'm not caught up in
[1:15:08] that there are people that have caught
[1:15:09] up in that fight now they think it's a
[1:15:10] spiritual fight it's the spiritual fight
[1:15:12] was actually
[1:15:14] was when the word of god came that was
[1:15:16] that's spiritual that's the only
[1:15:17] spiritual fight this other stuff that
[1:15:19] people are trying to
[1:15:20] catch people into at the moment is
[1:15:22] nonsense and don't get involved in it
[1:15:24] it's not true
[1:15:26] but if i could go to the next one
[1:15:28] i hope this is making sense i've just
[1:15:29] i'm going to talk about peace at the end
[1:15:32] of this because i just want to lay this
[1:15:34] foundation first and just take you
[1:15:36] through this now
[1:15:37] we
[1:15:38] we as humans we try and learn from our
[1:15:40] mistakes we think we can look back at
[1:15:41] history and think well we shot each
[1:15:43] other there so we won't um have any more
[1:15:45] conflict you know let's not fight
[1:15:46] anymore you know which is good that's we
[1:15:48] we try and learn although our
[1:15:51] mankind as they're becoming in more of a
[1:15:53] darker place they are
[1:15:57] they will go back to more and more
[1:15:59] natural conflict anyway even though we
[1:16:01] try and think we learn but i want to
[1:16:03] point out that
[1:16:05] that
[1:16:07] the the conflict that i'm talking about
[1:16:09] which is what i spoke about at the start
[1:16:10] the conflict that we're involved in is
[1:16:11] not
[1:16:12] it's not always guns shooting people
[1:16:14] that's in bombs and that that's the war
[1:16:17] is more than that goes the next one
[1:16:19] if you look around you
[1:16:21] if you look around you
[1:16:22] there is war going on all around us
[1:16:25] powerful wars that are happening
[1:16:27] and these are actual wars that are just
[1:16:29] this fight all around us
[1:16:32] and if you're not in a country where
[1:16:33] there's people running around with guns
[1:16:34] you're in a country where there's
[1:16:35] another conflict happening in and
[1:16:38] one of them one of the major conflicts
[1:16:40] now is there's there's an information
[1:16:42] war it's a it's a massive conflict it's
[1:16:45] a global conflict that's happening at
[1:16:46] the moment napoleon said if i were to
[1:16:49] give liberty to the press my power could
[1:16:51] not last three days
[1:16:53] meaning i need to keep control of the
[1:16:54] information because they
[1:16:56] they keep people for me and they keep
[1:16:58] putting out my side of the story
[1:17:01] and if i keep them doing that then the
[1:17:03] people are going to like me everything's
[1:17:04] going to work and i'm going to have
[1:17:05] support but if i take that away
[1:17:07] then they'll rise up against me because
[1:17:08] he'll start to hear these other opinions
[1:17:10] that i don't want him to hear he
[1:17:12] he learned that if he controlled the
[1:17:13] information that he would do well that's
[1:17:16] why he said another one of his quotes
[1:17:17] were you know napoleon he was the french
[1:17:19] general he said four hostile newspapers
[1:17:22] are more to be fed than a thousand
[1:17:23] bayonets
[1:17:24] so it was he he knew it was paramount
[1:17:26] for him to to get to won this
[1:17:28] information war right but
[1:17:31] but as a result
[1:17:34] what you've got now in the world as
[1:17:36] you've got
[1:17:38] it used to be news outlets used to be
[1:17:40] just
[1:17:41] unbiased information that you could go
[1:17:43] for a source of information and they
[1:17:45] would tell you
[1:17:46] something about an event but
[1:17:48] but
[1:17:49] it's not like that anymore it's become a
[1:17:52] hostile
[1:17:53] place
[1:17:55] 10 years ago
[1:17:56] people were maybe saying oh i'm sure
[1:17:58] these these people these newspapers are
[1:18:00] biased and that's biased this way and
[1:18:02] that's maybe
[1:18:03] they're attacking that and they would be
[1:18:05] laughed to score and say no that's not
[1:18:06] the case you're just thinking this stuff
[1:18:08] up
[1:18:08] but it's become apparent now
[1:18:11] it's it's like common knowledge now that
[1:18:13] there's a war going on it's not it's not
[1:18:15] a conspiracy anymore it's not just like
[1:18:17] a
[1:18:18] cover-up it's not unknown yeah that this
[1:18:23] there is a there is an information war
[1:18:25] going on and and the battle lines have
[1:18:27] been drawn and people know who is on
[1:18:28] which side and they are actively
[1:18:30] engaging in conflict with each other
[1:18:32] it's active it's not so these and most
[1:18:34] of them are media companies that they
[1:18:36] are not out to tell you the news they
[1:18:38] are out to
[1:18:39] compete against this other idea and most
[1:18:41] of it is now opinion it's not news yeah
[1:18:44] and and it's all coming to fruition
[1:18:47] and and that's why that's why there are
[1:18:50] there are now social media platforms
[1:18:52] that have started up and they're like
[1:18:53] the fastest growing ones ever because
[1:18:55] they are they are say say if there's a
[1:18:58] bulk of the social media is for this
[1:19:00] side
[1:19:01] then if one starts up for this side
[1:19:04] all of the people that are for that side
[1:19:05] say well great there's now a platform
[1:19:07] that it's on our side so they jump and
[1:19:09] go on that one and they leave that one
[1:19:11] and it's massive these ones are
[1:19:13] there was one app that was i think it
[1:19:15] was
[1:19:16] truth social something it was like the
[1:19:17] fastest growing app ever because when it
[1:19:20] opened everyone wanted to be on it
[1:19:21] because it would it's a war they're like
[1:19:23] right here's our here's our next
[1:19:25] battleground in there we'll jump on that
[1:19:27] this is a massive conflict that's
[1:19:29] happening in the world and i wouldn't
[1:19:30] recommend
[1:19:32] getting involved too much in newspapers
[1:19:34] these days because it's actually uh
[1:19:37] it is it's a
[1:19:39] you get caught up in the middle of an of
[1:19:41] a war there's actual there's a there's a
[1:19:42] war happening because now these are
[1:19:44] people that say we want peace we want
[1:19:46] peace and yet during the day they're
[1:19:48] sprouting out conflict and war you see
[1:19:51] it because it's deception
[1:19:53] and and this is a powerful well this
[1:19:55] this is causing families to divide and
[1:19:56] this is causing people to divide this
[1:19:59] this what's happening here is causing so
[1:20:00] much division because it's drawing
[1:20:02] battlegrounds of well you're this idea
[1:20:04] you must be that you're that idea you
[1:20:05] must be that it's been the next one
[1:20:08] we
[1:20:09] i put this one here because it's even
[1:20:11] got this country all caught up in it you
[1:20:12] know like what this what what's
[1:20:14] happening in our country it's it's
[1:20:16] these people are the epicenter of what
[1:20:18] they would call an information war and
[1:20:20] and
[1:20:21] there was you know we're not immune to
[1:20:23] it being down here we we all have
[1:20:25] every country is involved in this and
[1:20:27] it's a it's becoming a
[1:20:30] you can't see an end to this
[1:20:32] i remember barry sofa he was uh he's a
[1:20:34] political commentator for like 30 years
[1:20:37] he was talking about this situation here
[1:20:39] and he said he said i've been talking
[1:20:42] i've been doing political commentary and
[1:20:45] this for 30 years i've never ever seen
[1:20:46] in my entire life anything like what i
[1:20:48] saw what happened down here now he's a
[1:20:51] he's actually an older guy so he's he's
[1:20:53] a bit more unbiased
[1:20:55] and he just says it as it is and he
[1:20:57] doesn't mind too much about which way it
[1:20:58] is but he's he's very mainstream middle
[1:21:01] of the road stuff but
[1:21:03] but he was saying usually whenever
[1:21:05] there's a big crowd the politicians are
[1:21:06] running to get down there because they
[1:21:08] want to be in front of the cameras
[1:21:09] yeah that's always what happens but he
[1:21:11] said i've never seen anything like this
[1:21:12] where there was a massive crowd and they
[1:21:14] made a pact that no one will go down
[1:21:16] there
[1:21:16] because they've drawn the battle lines
[1:21:18] we're on this team that's the other team
[1:21:19] it's an information war you know and if
[1:21:21] you if you went down and
[1:21:23] visited it would be like you would be
[1:21:25] seen as oh you're on that team are you
[1:21:27] you know you've changed sides you know
[1:21:29] it's it was an information war
[1:21:31] and he was surprised he didn't know what
[1:21:33] he was he said why is this happening
[1:21:35] i've never seen this before but he
[1:21:36] doesn't realize it's a because of this
[1:21:38] concept of war that satan is making
[1:21:40] making people so divisive getting caught
[1:21:43] up and all this sort of stuff
[1:21:44] and next one i'll just go through this
[1:21:46] fast
[1:21:47] the next one is an economic war you know
[1:21:49] there's been an economic war going on
[1:21:52] and
[1:21:53] i'm going to put this one here i'll just
[1:21:54] give you one example of this economic
[1:21:56] war
[1:21:57] there was
[1:21:58] china a while ago they they would have
[1:22:00] real i think they realized that they
[1:22:01] couldn't
[1:22:03] they've always been in conflict with
[1:22:04] america but they thought we can't beat
[1:22:05] them militarily they're too strong
[1:22:07] now that what we can do is attack them
[1:22:10] economically so what they did um
[1:22:13] in the in the mid
[1:22:15] in the early 90s they this is an act of
[1:22:18] war that they engaged in with with
[1:22:19] america to try and bring it down it
[1:22:21] wasn't
[1:22:22] uh
[1:22:23] haphazard thing it was an actual act of
[1:22:25] war they pegged their their dollar to
[1:22:28] the american dollar so they said one
[1:22:30] american dollar
[1:22:31] is going to be worth eight u.n so it
[1:22:33] doesn't matter if the american dollar
[1:22:34] goes up or down
[1:22:36] our one is going to stay with the
[1:22:37] american dollar and the eight u.n so
[1:22:38] it's always going to be eight times
[1:22:40] cheaper than the american dollar it was
[1:22:42] an act of war because they said
[1:22:45] if we do that that means we can start
[1:22:46] making things because what we've got is
[1:22:48] a whole lot of people here that can make
[1:22:49] stuff we can start making stuff and we
[1:22:51] can make it eight times cheaper than the
[1:22:53] americans because of the currency
[1:22:55] difference
[1:22:56] and we can then start
[1:22:58] selling that stuff back to them and we
[1:22:59] will slowly close their factories we
[1:23:00] will slowly start to get all the work
[1:23:02] and we will become a powerful economic
[1:23:03] force and they will become weaker that
[1:23:05] was the plan it was an act of war and
[1:23:06] that they engaged in from the
[1:23:09] early 90s they said we're going to peg
[1:23:11] this
[1:23:12] to the dollar
[1:23:15] and
[1:23:16] now
[1:23:17] as a
[1:23:18] result you know you all know what
[1:23:20] started happening next one
[1:23:22] this is
[1:23:24] this is
[1:23:25] you can see the
[1:23:27] at the same time the the graph on the
[1:23:29] bottom right is the american
[1:23:31] manufacturing jobs look the way that it
[1:23:33] goes it the the
[1:23:35] the chinese succeeded in this economic
[1:23:37] war that they were engaged in with the
[1:23:38] american look at the the manufacturing
[1:23:40] jobs all started going down and as in
[1:23:42] every war there were beneficiaries of
[1:23:44] this conflict you know some people found
[1:23:46] themselves in the middle of this
[1:23:47] conflict that they benefited from it
[1:23:49] just because they just happened to be at
[1:23:51] the right place at the right time
[1:23:52] companies like walmart
[1:23:54] what walmart set up was they their whole
[1:23:56] scheme was we're going to bring in
[1:23:58] chinese stuff and sell it you know and
[1:23:59] we can
[1:24:00] sell up stuff cheaper than what the
[1:24:02] americans can make it and we can just so
[1:24:04] so
[1:24:05] they were they were essentially caught
[1:24:06] up in this war but they they
[1:24:09] benefited from the war i'm not saying
[1:24:11] they were there was a plan to do that
[1:24:12] they just have to be at the right place
[1:24:13] the right time the same with the
[1:24:14] warehouse you know right they were just
[1:24:16] the right place at the right time and
[1:24:17] they they benefited from this
[1:24:20] war that china engaged in
[1:24:22] that's just
[1:24:24] this is the way
[1:24:25] as a result walmart and now the
[1:24:27] they got they got right in the middle of
[1:24:28] this war and they became
[1:24:30] between two superpowers and they they
[1:24:32] seem to they profited off the war so
[1:24:34] much so that they are now at the moment
[1:24:36] the biggest company in the world by
[1:24:38] turnover there's no other company in the
[1:24:39] world that are bigger than walmart
[1:24:41] because they basically
[1:24:42] take china and sell it to america but
[1:24:44] they just happened to be at the right
[1:24:45] place the right time started up and they
[1:24:46] they were the ones that worked the
[1:24:48] scheme but they only got there because
[1:24:50] china is at war there's an economic war
[1:24:53] going on you know and
[1:24:55] so we we may just be living our lives
[1:24:57] and kicking along you know but not
[1:24:59] realizing there's a massive conflict
[1:25:00] there's an economic war happening
[1:25:02] there's there's conflict happening and
[1:25:04] it's
[1:25:05] here's the next one
[1:25:07] and
[1:25:08] at the same time you had we had you have
[1:25:10] cultural wars
[1:25:12] you know that that that these ideas come
[1:25:15] into people's minds that are and
[1:25:17] essentially the cultural wars were in
[1:25:18] the 60s it was
[1:25:20] so there were no guns being shot in
[1:25:21] these wars or apart from if they were
[1:25:22] trying to calm down riots but there was
[1:25:25] a war between ideas of
[1:25:27] of
[1:25:28] next one
[1:25:29] the the war essentially people boiled it
[1:25:31] down and it was the war against the
[1:25:33] three ps which was the parents the
[1:25:34] pastors and the police because they
[1:25:36] represented society
[1:25:39] like parents represented the family unit
[1:25:41] and mum dad the children they the
[1:25:43] guidance from the parents and helping
[1:25:45] you know the family unit
[1:25:46] so they fought against that fought
[1:25:48] against the authority of the parents
[1:25:49] fought against that unit
[1:25:51] pastors represented
[1:25:53] the church represented god represented
[1:25:55] the the rule of the higher being being
[1:25:57] that that we follow his rules you know
[1:25:59] they fought against that and the police
[1:26:01] represented civil society where that was
[1:26:02] the law and you you
[1:26:04] you obey the law and you helped be a
[1:26:06] good citizen you know so you've got
[1:26:07] these three pillars in society that that
[1:26:10] keeps society
[1:26:11] peaceful because when when god runs the
[1:26:13] show he says
[1:26:15] the parents are to be like this and the
[1:26:16] family unit is like this and you you
[1:26:17] know that the honor your parents and you
[1:26:20] the family unit stays together you you
[1:26:21] know the and then you serve god you
[1:26:24] honor his ways and then you honor
[1:26:26] society you obey the laws of the land so
[1:26:28] he's got this way but the culture was
[1:26:30] essentially all they were were a
[1:26:32] rebellion against against those things
[1:26:35] and people call it a culture war but it
[1:26:36] was just a it was just people fighting
[1:26:40] people getting it wanting a different
[1:26:41] idea and fighting against all these
[1:26:43] things and
[1:26:45] and i know not yet
[1:26:47] as a result you had massive just go back
[1:26:49] you had back one sorry you had massive
[1:26:51] upheaval in society and i'm going to say
[1:26:55] that it hasn't produced anything very
[1:26:56] good
[1:26:57] the
[1:26:58] because what that was was darkness
[1:27:00] coming in darkness came upon mankind and
[1:27:02] they decided to start living out that
[1:27:03] darkness now
[1:27:05] it gets to a point now where you have
[1:27:07] like
[1:27:08] you have a disaster somewhere
[1:27:10] like an earthquake or something what's
[1:27:11] the first thing that happens is people
[1:27:13] go on loot and then you try and if
[1:27:15] people need shelter then they might they
[1:27:18] might put a
[1:27:19] designated football stadium to house
[1:27:22] people but then within that there
[1:27:23] becomes rape and all these things happen
[1:27:25] in there it's like why because in
[1:27:26] society you've got darkness so
[1:27:29] that things don't function like what
[1:27:30] they should you know like if it was a
[1:27:31] godly society when there's a disaster
[1:27:33] yeah people aren't going to be running
[1:27:34] out looting they're going to be running
[1:27:36] out helping people is everyone okay here
[1:27:37] okay
[1:27:38] fixing up things and when they're all if
[1:27:40] they'll get put in a stadium they're all
[1:27:41] going to be helping but
[1:27:43] but as a result of darkness coming in
[1:27:45] it's not the same
[1:27:46] the next one
[1:27:50] the next thing that we face
[1:27:52] now the only spiritual war that i know
[1:27:54] of is
[1:27:56] is actually the
[1:27:58] satan coming against the revealed word
[1:28:00] of god that's that's the true spiritual
[1:28:02] war not not don't get caught up in
[1:28:03] anything else these days there's
[1:28:05] proclaiming a spiritual war between
[1:28:07] essentially the romans and the jews you
[1:28:09] know like that that conflict that was
[1:28:11] titus taken over jerusalem you know
[1:28:15] that's the war that people that's the
[1:28:17] type there but
[1:28:18] we're not of that war that's not a
[1:28:20] spiritual war that's just that's a both
[1:28:22] everyone is deceived but
[1:28:24] there there has been a spiritual war
[1:28:26] waged against the word of god
[1:28:29] and it's a it's a
[1:28:31] the war is raging and it's the i i just
[1:28:33] printed this one off i don't know if you
[1:28:35] can see that but this is the world
[1:28:36] council of churches
[1:28:38] and this is their celebration of baptism
[1:28:40] i'm just going to give you one example
[1:28:41] of this because it's always the easiest
[1:28:42] one to show that we're in a spiritual
[1:28:44] war
[1:28:44] this is their rules baptism is
[1:28:47] administered with water in the name of
[1:28:49] the father the son and the holy spirit
[1:28:51] so
[1:28:52] next one
[1:28:55] you know you're at war
[1:28:56] you know europe there's a you know
[1:28:58] there's a war happening when when if
[1:29:00] paul went to
[1:29:01] join the the this group that he wouldn't
[1:29:04] be allowed on their team because he
[1:29:06] doesn't agree with what they say
[1:29:08] so just by virtue of that because paul
[1:29:11] said acts 19 then said paul john really
[1:29:13] baptized with baptism of repentance
[1:29:14] saying unto the people that they should
[1:29:16] believe in him which had come after them
[1:29:17] that is on christ jesus when they heard
[1:29:19] this they were baptized in the name of
[1:29:21] the lord jesus
[1:29:22] so so there's a war between these two
[1:29:25] groups because if paul went in to preach
[1:29:27] in their churches his his
[1:29:29] uh
[1:29:31] his um
[1:29:33] doctrine on baptism he wouldn't be
[1:29:35] allowed to preach there so
[1:29:37] you know we have a war in our hands
[1:29:38] there's a there's a war between this one
[1:29:40] group and another group that that
[1:29:43] and it's a
[1:29:44] you've got conflict
[1:29:45] you've got war and that this this war
[1:29:47] has been
[1:29:53] and this war has been raging
[1:29:56] from right from the start the the
[1:29:59] the seed of the serpent that's it's been
[1:30:01] a war raging all the way through but
[1:30:02] when jesus was here they said the same
[1:30:04] thing
[1:30:05] here is jesus when he was when he was
[1:30:08] being on his trial that they these
[1:30:10] people on this other side they just
[1:30:12] tried to get liars and stuff to come and
[1:30:15] speak it speak a lie to try and convict
[1:30:17] him they knew they were lies lying but
[1:30:19] they they wanted to try and make it all
[1:30:21] work and convict him that shows that
[1:30:23] there was actually these were supposed
[1:30:25] to be godly people but in their heart
[1:30:27] they knew they were getting liars in to
[1:30:28] come and speak lies and they were hoping
[1:30:30] that the lies would all just gel
[1:30:32] together and that the
[1:30:34] the um
[1:30:35] romans would put jesus to death
[1:30:37] but then it says for many war false
[1:30:39] witnesses against them but their
[1:30:40] witnesses agreed not together
[1:30:43] you know so they because they they you
[1:30:45] know when liars speak they forget the
[1:30:46] lies they've told one liar speaks
[1:30:48] another life speaks because they're all
[1:30:49] lies nothing works
[1:30:50] so they couldn't actually get in that
[1:30:52] way even though they desired to and if
[1:30:53] they could they would they would have
[1:30:55] that just shows the
[1:30:57] there was a battle between
[1:30:59] that
[1:30:59] and even even there was a battle once he
[1:31:02] when they found out that he was gone
[1:31:04] that jesus the tomb was empty
[1:31:07] they
[1:31:08] they couldn't let out that possibly he
[1:31:10] has risen so they
[1:31:12] they gave
[1:31:14] a lot of money to the soldiers
[1:31:16] and they said okay here's the here's
[1:31:18] what you say
[1:31:20] if anyone asks you you go and tell them
[1:31:22] that they were that the disciples came
[1:31:24] in at night and stole them away you know
[1:31:26] you guys were sleeping and they came in
[1:31:27] and stole them and
[1:31:28] and then if that gets if word gets back
[1:31:31] to your superiors and you guys get in
[1:31:33] trouble for that then we will go and um
[1:31:36] you know we'll persuade him and we'll
[1:31:38] probably bribe him as well and say no
[1:31:39] that is that is what happened yet we
[1:31:42] we know these disciples they're real
[1:31:44] cunning you know they probably sedated
[1:31:46] them when they were sleeping and they
[1:31:47] went in and got him or you know
[1:31:49] they were all involved in this big lie
[1:31:51] it was just a it was a battle going on
[1:31:52] and it was a battle full of lies and you
[1:31:55] see the same thing today against the
[1:31:56] message it's a battle full of lies that
[1:31:58] people like
[1:31:59] breaches lies
[1:32:02] and it doesn't take long before you
[1:32:03] uncover the lies and you think okay well
[1:32:04] i know what where you're off and this is
[1:32:06] what's been happening for a long time
[1:32:08] there's been lies you know
[1:32:10] spoken for a long time here's one here
[1:32:13] this next one
[1:32:14] i i
[1:32:16] i found this
[1:32:18] well it's not amusing but it's it's
[1:32:20] i'll just read it brother branham says a
[1:32:22] certain baptist church that my little
[1:32:24] family went to the other day and they
[1:32:26] had been down at the meeting in tucson
[1:32:28] the pastor got up knowing that not
[1:32:30] knowing that the boy that goes with my
[1:32:32] daughter as a member there
[1:32:35] and he said
[1:32:36] you know i just learned brother adam's
[1:32:38] father and mother travel in a circus
[1:32:42] and that they were magicians and that's
[1:32:44] a little trick that he does
[1:32:46] so i guess it was a trick that he heals
[1:32:47] the sick i doubt
[1:32:49] whether my father and mother ever seen a
[1:32:51] circus they never seen an automobile
[1:32:53] until i had one see they never know
[1:32:55] nothing about it but you see the devil
[1:32:57] has always got to say
[1:32:58] they told jesus they do this by
[1:33:00] beelzebub so
[1:33:02] there were lies going around that his
[1:33:04] his brother and his parents were
[1:33:05] magicians in a circus and he learned all
[1:33:07] these healing tricks in the circus from
[1:33:09] his parents
[1:33:10] [Laughter]
[1:33:11] that was a lie going around and this
[1:33:12] this baptist minister had heard that
[1:33:15] and he started repeating that just like
[1:33:17] the lie that went around that oh no
[1:33:19] jesus didn't raise from the dead the
[1:33:20] disciples just came and stole him away
[1:33:22] at night that's how he rose that was the
[1:33:24] lie going around and if you were you'd
[1:33:26] hear that lying and if you were if you
[1:33:28] were of that
[1:33:29] on that side you would just
[1:33:30] wholeheartedly believe that lie and
[1:33:32] spout it out again because you it suits
[1:33:34] with you didn't like jesus anyway so
[1:33:36] that suited your idea so you think well
[1:33:38] science they told me must be right and
[1:33:39] that's what was happening here there
[1:33:40] were just lies going around and people
[1:33:42] repeating lies saying his parents were
[1:33:44] in the circus
[1:33:46] and he brother pam says they'd never
[1:33:48] even been to the circus oh do you want a
[1:33:49] call
[1:33:51] never even know
[1:33:55] this is
[1:33:57] um this is another one this is when
[1:33:59] brother brown went to tucson and they
[1:34:01] said are you here to start a church he
[1:34:03] said no i'm here to help you guys you
[1:34:04] know just a minister in that but he
[1:34:06] never got one phone call
[1:34:08] and
[1:34:09] and he said it's because they had to get
[1:34:11] together right after that after they
[1:34:13] talked to him and they said if any man
[1:34:14] had me in the pulpit they would
[1:34:15] excommunicate that preacher
[1:34:17] why because there was a war going on yep
[1:34:19] you know and
[1:34:21] and it would have been the same with
[1:34:22] jesus you know that when he was here you
[1:34:23] know if you if you have him in your
[1:34:26] synagogue you're out of the synagogue it
[1:34:28] would have been the same with paul there
[1:34:29] was a there's a war going on
[1:34:31] and
[1:34:33] i've just got a few more
[1:34:35] now we come to we see all these other
[1:34:37] conflicts but they now we we also have
[1:34:39] we can't
[1:34:40] negate the fact that we also have
[1:34:41] physical
[1:34:43] wars you know which is the ones that's
[1:34:44] going on and at the moment
[1:34:47] and what i find amusing about this
[1:34:50] you know is that how quickly life can
[1:34:52] change you know this is these are some
[1:34:53] before and after photos that before that
[1:34:56] when you had this
[1:34:58] these places would have just been people
[1:35:00] in these cities and kiev and they would
[1:35:01] have had plans and ideas and businesses
[1:35:04] and schemes and maybe some people just
[1:35:06] bought a home and they've worked so hard
[1:35:08] for it and the they've just started a
[1:35:09] family and all these different things
[1:35:10] you know life was going on
[1:35:12] even up to january of this year life was
[1:35:15] that that was all that was involved in
[1:35:17] life it was just all good things were
[1:35:18] going to go well
[1:35:19] and then a month later how so much can
[1:35:22] change in a month or six weeks later
[1:35:24] it's completely different
[1:35:26] and
[1:35:27] and
[1:35:28] unfortunately what we see here is is
[1:35:31] just darkness coming in more and more
[1:35:33] and i've just got i just got a few of
[1:35:35] these photos
[1:35:36] it's just
[1:35:39] it just
[1:35:40] this is so pointless any any war i think
[1:35:42] is pointless when you just all you get
[1:35:44] is destruction and ruin and death it's
[1:35:45] an absolute pointless venture i can't
[1:35:47] wait to be in a place where there is no
[1:35:49] war amen
[1:35:51] it's absolute
[1:35:53] it's just
[1:35:57] this is not
[1:35:58] we are not civilized people that when we
[1:36:00] do this this is not no war is
[1:36:04] this is nonsense
[1:36:06] and and
[1:36:08] i think the people of god never desire
[1:36:10] wars and never want to start wars but
[1:36:11] this is just these are people's
[1:36:13] businesses and people's livelihoods just
[1:36:15] everything just changes but that goes to
[1:36:17] show that
[1:36:18] we can't trust in that our trust and our
[1:36:20] confidence has to be in the lord because
[1:36:23] it could happen here in a moment
[1:36:26] there could be a nuclear war tomorrow
[1:36:27] and life as we know it will change we
[1:36:29] could be putting all this effort into
[1:36:31] certain things
[1:36:32] right you know even in the economy and
[1:36:34] certain things and tomorrow there could
[1:36:35] be a nuclear war and things will change
[1:36:37] amen you know or a massive war breaks
[1:36:40] out and things just change you're not
[1:36:41] the same as what they used to be go to
[1:36:43] the next one
[1:36:44] um
[1:36:45] and i think it's the saddest thing to
[1:36:47] watch
[1:36:48] um
[1:36:50] i think one of the saddest things that
[1:36:52] i've seen
[1:36:53] played in this conflict is if you know
[1:36:55] the story of titanic
[1:36:57] they
[1:36:58] as with a not just this ocean line about
[1:37:00] a lot of ocean liners that actually all
[1:37:02] of them they didn't have enough
[1:37:03] lifeboats for the people on board it's
[1:37:05] especially if they had over ten thousand
[1:37:07] if they were more than ten thousand tons
[1:37:08] they didn't really have rules to
[1:37:10] regulate ships of that size so most
[1:37:13] almost all of the vessels over ten
[1:37:15] thousand tons they didn't have
[1:37:17] enough lifeboats i think the titanic had
[1:37:20] i think it was 40 or 50 i could be wrong
[1:37:22] but somewhere around that vicinity which
[1:37:24] was about average i think the best ship
[1:37:25] had like 70
[1:37:28] um of the people could get out of the
[1:37:29] boat onto a lifeboat that's at full
[1:37:31] capacity but
[1:37:33] what happened on this one was there were
[1:37:35] people once they got the lifeboats into
[1:37:37] the water and the
[1:37:38] some of them could could take 70 people
[1:37:40] but they only they set off with 30
[1:37:42] people and they were all the first class
[1:37:44] passengers first but once they got out
[1:37:46] into the water
[1:37:48] they
[1:37:49] people would
[1:37:51] you can imagine in the water there were
[1:37:52] hundreds and hundreds of people
[1:37:54] and
[1:37:54] the people in the boats
[1:37:56] decided some people wanted to go back
[1:37:58] that but the majority rule said we're
[1:38:00] not going to go back if we try and pick
[1:38:01] them up we're going to sink our own boat
[1:38:02] so we're going to leave them to die
[1:38:04] and just save ourselves because
[1:38:06] otherwise we will all die
[1:38:08] that concept you know and
[1:38:12] some people in the boat that wanted to
[1:38:14] save people they he one man he said well
[1:38:17] you bear me record everybody here if we
[1:38:19] survived this i wanted to go back and
[1:38:21] save people and you guys all said no so
[1:38:23] just so it's on a record that's what i
[1:38:25] wanted to do
[1:38:26] but you guys wouldn't let me
[1:38:28] but
[1:38:28] this is what's that's the saddest thing
[1:38:30] because that's what's happening in the
[1:38:31] ukraine is that
[1:38:33] is that people are essentially the rest
[1:38:34] of the countries are saying well we
[1:38:36] would love to come and help you when we
[1:38:37] sympathize with your plight that you're
[1:38:39] all dying but if if we come and try and
[1:38:41] save you we risk ourselves and sinking
[1:38:44] our own boat you know so we're just
[1:38:45] going to sit back and watch you
[1:38:47] oh yeah watch you die
[1:38:49] that's what's happening you know that
[1:38:50] cause and the ukraine are there saying
[1:38:51] oh buddy old pal come and help me and
[1:38:53] they're saying we won't do it
[1:38:55] we're not going to do it you know and
[1:38:57] morally i don't think it's right you
[1:38:58] know hey call there bluff go and okay
[1:39:01] bomb us if you want you know
[1:39:03] what is life yeah we'll go in and we'll
[1:39:04] help and if you newcast you nuke us
[1:39:07] maybe sometimes men and women need to
[1:39:08] stand up and just do the right thing
[1:39:10] regardless of whether hey
[1:39:12] you know wouldn't you feel better if you
[1:39:13] did try and go back and save people and
[1:39:15] you'll sunk unless you think well i
[1:39:16] tried to help i died myself but i tried
[1:39:18] to help you know
[1:39:20] i know it's a moral dilemma but that's
[1:39:21] the saddest thing about this conflict is
[1:39:23] that's what's happening
[1:39:24] it doesn't matter how many pictures you
[1:39:26] see of women and children little
[1:39:28] children lost and killed
[1:39:30] they won't go in because they say if we
[1:39:32] go on we risk ourselves and it won't
[1:39:34] happen and russia knows it too so it's a
[1:39:36] that's the worst part of this conflict
[1:39:37] is seeing that happen in slow motion
[1:39:39] essentially and no one will step in
[1:39:41] until and the country will get taken
[1:39:43] over
[1:39:44] may or may not i don't know but
[1:39:46] their friends won't step in and help
[1:39:48] you wonder if they'll be good friends
[1:39:49] afterwards
[1:39:51] um
[1:39:53] but i want to i want to just speak now
[1:39:56] that we've talked about a whole lot of
[1:39:57] conflict
[1:39:58] i want to speak about the term of peace
[1:40:00] now because we serve a god of peace and
[1:40:02] this is what what i want to major on for
[1:40:04] another five minute five or ten minutes
[1:40:06] then we're done
[1:40:07] this idea of peace
[1:40:09] i'm so glad that we can have peace
[1:40:11] now
[1:40:13] the first
[1:40:14] the first
[1:40:16] person we have to make peace with is god
[1:40:19] because when we're born we're actually
[1:40:21] we talk about being at war when we're
[1:40:23] born
[1:40:24] we're at we're actually at war with god
[1:40:27] when we're born and it says
[1:40:29] romans 8 7 says because the carnal mind
[1:40:31] is enmity against god for it is not
[1:40:33] subject to the law of god neither can be
[1:40:36] so we're born basically at war with god
[1:40:39] and
[1:40:40] that's not a good place to be but we are
[1:40:42] in a constant conflict because of that
[1:40:44] because of our fallen nature we're in a
[1:40:46] constant conflict with god and that's
[1:40:48] that's where we are when we begin our
[1:40:50] life and that's how we start to live our
[1:40:52] life is in a conflict against god and a
[1:40:54] war with god
[1:40:55] so
[1:40:56] the first thing we have to do is make
[1:40:58] peace with god we have to there has to
[1:40:59] be some way we can make peace because we
[1:41:01] don't want to be at war with god we
[1:41:02] don't want to be found fighting against
[1:41:04] god because in the end we're going to
[1:41:05] lose if we if we have this conflict
[1:41:08] you know as paul says again but i see
[1:41:09] another law in my members warring
[1:41:11] against the law of my mind my mind wants
[1:41:14] to serve god but my fallen nature is
[1:41:16] warring against that idea bringing me
[1:41:18] into captivity to the law of sun which
[1:41:19] is in my members we're at this constant
[1:41:22] war with god and
[1:41:24] the only
[1:41:25] it's because of our sinful nature and
[1:41:27] the only way that that that could be
[1:41:30] that could be
[1:41:31] done as if god came down himself paid
[1:41:33] the price of our sins and actually came
[1:41:35] in and
[1:41:36] dwelt in us and had this new life that
[1:41:38] actually is at peace with god and
[1:41:40] that was god's whole plan of coming down
[1:41:42] and saving us was so that he could
[1:41:44] create peace because if god says to us
[1:41:46] blessed are the peacemakers he has to be
[1:41:48] the biggest peacemaker that there is you
[1:41:50] know because he always he doesn't just
[1:41:51] say us to do one thing he doesn't do it
[1:41:53] he always does
[1:41:54] he does it first and he expects us to do
[1:41:56] the same thing it's like
[1:41:58] greater love has no man that they lay
[1:42:00] their life down for their friend well he
[1:42:01] laid his life down for us and he's
[1:42:03] saying well can't you even commit your
[1:42:04] life to me and lay it down for me you
[1:42:06] know i laid it down for you now can't
[1:42:07] you do it for me
[1:42:08] he doesn't just ask us to do something
[1:42:10] he wouldn't do himself so he was a great
[1:42:11] peacemaker and
[1:42:13] i like one of my favorite scriptures and
[1:42:15] one of my favorite ideas
[1:42:18] next
[1:42:19] is
[1:42:20] in concepts of humanity and and the
[1:42:23] power of god was this one
[1:42:25] when the angels came down after jesus
[1:42:27] was born and they said
[1:42:28] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[1:42:31] peace and good will toward men
[1:42:34] because when christ was born he was he
[1:42:37] was he was this ambassador of peace
[1:42:38] there was this great war between god and
[1:42:40] man
[1:42:41] and here came the son of god down born
[1:42:44] in a manger and he was a he he came down
[1:42:46] with a you could say with with terms of
[1:42:49] peace he says i want to make peace with
[1:42:51] you i'm here to make peace
[1:42:53] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[1:42:55] peace and good will toward men and we
[1:42:58] can we can accept that that
[1:43:00] peace from god and accept that he paid
[1:43:02] the price for us and
[1:43:04] be forgiven of our sins and have that
[1:43:05] new life come into us and that new life
[1:43:07] that dwells within us is at total peace
[1:43:09] with god we're not we can we're no
[1:43:11] longer at war with god we're now at
[1:43:13] peace and we can live a life we can
[1:43:15] accept as terms of peace
[1:43:17] and actually as terms of peace our
[1:43:19] surrender
[1:43:21] i demand that you surrender we say lord
[1:43:23] i surrender
[1:43:25] and then and then he rules over us and
[1:43:27] then we have peace you know he becomes
[1:43:30] the prince of peace comes in and he
[1:43:31] rules in our life and he gives us peace
[1:43:33] and amongst all of this conflict that we
[1:43:35] see in the world we can have total peace
[1:43:38] we can have total peace amongst all this
[1:43:40] conflict because we've got the prince of
[1:43:41] peace that dwells in us and i want to
[1:43:43] say this that
[1:43:44] the that with the blessing of god always
[1:43:47] brings peace the blessing of god always
[1:43:49] brings peace i love this scripture the
[1:43:51] lord bless you and keep you the lord
[1:43:53] make his face to shine upon you and be
[1:43:54] gracious to you the lord lift up his
[1:43:57] countenance upon you and give you peace
[1:43:59] the blessing of god always brings peace
[1:44:01] in our life the the more of god we get
[1:44:04] in our life
[1:44:05] the more peace that we have in our life
[1:44:08] and
[1:44:09] and the
[1:44:11] next one
[1:44:15] this this picture here is king solomon's
[1:44:17] temple now i just want to touch on this
[1:44:19] real quick and i want to show you
[1:44:20] something else the
[1:44:22] this here was
[1:44:24] david david had war all his life but
[1:44:26] because god was blessing david david in
[1:44:28] every fight that he had
[1:44:30] he won every battle because even though
[1:44:32] he had to fight he kept on winning and
[1:44:34] getting stronger and stronger and
[1:44:35] stronger till he slowly defeated all his
[1:44:37] enemies and he overtook this
[1:44:38] patch of ground
[1:44:40] at jerusalem
[1:44:41] and then by the time his son solomon
[1:44:43] went to rule solomon also decided to
[1:44:45] serve god too so god continued to bless
[1:44:47] solomon but by the time solomon came
[1:44:49] along david had built up such a powerful
[1:44:52] army
[1:44:53] you talk of this concept peace through
[1:44:54] strength that people were scared to come
[1:44:57] and fight against them because they'd
[1:44:58] beaten them so many times they were they
[1:45:00] they were pushed back and pushed back
[1:45:01] and as a result you had peace in the
[1:45:03] land and that's when solomon came along
[1:45:05] he there was peace in the land because
[1:45:07] david had built up such a mighty army
[1:45:09] and that and then david could go on he
[1:45:11] built the temple and
[1:45:12] solomon built the temple and built an
[1:45:14] even more bigger army and i often think
[1:45:17] you know when david was just a ragtag
[1:45:19] guy you know it's like us when we first
[1:45:20] start serving the lord satan thinks we
[1:45:21] just easy game i will just go and deal
[1:45:23] to that little guy you know like when
[1:45:25] when david was up in the hills with him
[1:45:26] and his
[1:45:27] that all the men that drew with them
[1:45:29] were all the men that were indebted and
[1:45:30] that had nowhere else to go and they
[1:45:32] were they were they were the men that no
[1:45:33] one else wanted there with this ragtape
[1:45:34] bunch running around and and
[1:45:37] saw all and all these different enemies
[1:45:38] thought they could easily just overtake
[1:45:40] them you know so they said oh let's just
[1:45:41] go and attack that little david up there
[1:45:43] in the hills with his men you know
[1:45:44] there's a hundred or so of them 200
[1:45:46] let's just go and attack them you know
[1:45:47] in the minute ziggler did too we'll just
[1:45:49] attack their women and children you know
[1:45:51] but because god was with david he kept
[1:45:53] on blessing david and david kept on
[1:45:54] winning and the more that he won the
[1:45:56] more he got peace so much so that as he
[1:45:59] got you know when he was just a smaller
[1:46:01] little battalion of guys
[1:46:04] if one of his enemies spoke to another
[1:46:06] one of his enemies and said hey how
[1:46:07] about we go and fight against david they
[1:46:08] would have said yeah let's go and get
[1:46:09] him he's easy he's an easy target he's
[1:46:11] easy game you know we're just going to
[1:46:12] attack him
[1:46:13] but as he got more and more powerful
[1:46:15] those same people maybe would have come
[1:46:16] to each other and said i'm thinking
[1:46:17] about attacking david and one of them
[1:46:19] would have said oh i'm not so sure about
[1:46:21] that you know
[1:46:22] uh we've tried that four times now and
[1:46:25] now it's bigger and stronger
[1:46:27] uh
[1:46:28] i think we won't do it you imagine when
[1:46:30] solomon came along and solomon amassed a
[1:46:32] mighty army
[1:46:34] even the thought of going and attacking
[1:46:35] solomon people like there is no way
[1:46:37] we're going to attack solomon no don't
[1:46:38] touch his borders don't don't mess with
[1:46:40] any of his people leave him alone so he
[1:46:43] gets wondered that we're after him we'll
[1:46:44] be done you know he's he's because he
[1:46:47] monopolized all the countries around
[1:46:48] them he made them supply more this wood
[1:46:51] and all these things and all they all
[1:46:52] like solomon and everything but god gave
[1:46:54] them peace through strength because
[1:46:56] because they committed their lives to
[1:46:57] god and they started god established
[1:46:58] their life the more that they were
[1:47:00] established the more peace they had in
[1:47:01] their life
[1:47:02] and
[1:47:03] and that's why brother brown says you
[1:47:05] know you can get so full of god that the
[1:47:06] devil doesn't know what to do with you
[1:47:07] you know because the blessing of god
[1:47:09] just makes you you standing you're
[1:47:11] standing upon his word in every area of
[1:47:13] your life and you're you're fortified
[1:47:14] and there's there's peace in your life
[1:47:15] in every area that's that's what the
[1:47:17] blessing of the lord does for your life
[1:47:19] it gives you peace
[1:47:22] and
[1:47:23] we win every battle that we engage in as
[1:47:25] a believer if there's a promise of god
[1:47:27] we we win i've and the we get peace in
[1:47:30] every area like if we've got a sickness
[1:47:32] in our body that's actually a war i
[1:47:34] remember one time when i was
[1:47:36] you know when you you get sick and you
[1:47:38] you're sleeping at night and you've got
[1:47:39] maybe a temperature and
[1:47:41] you're trying to go to sleep and you're
[1:47:42] thinking the most stupidest things you
[1:47:44] ever could think of has anyone ever done
[1:47:45] that you're just thinking
[1:47:48] okay i'm and you can't sleep because
[1:47:50] you're thinking i'm walking across this
[1:47:51] branch and then if i fall down the
[1:47:53] branch i'll hit the suitcase and then
[1:47:54] the lid will go this way
[1:47:57] you're thinking man they're branched
[1:47:58] they're not then the suitcase is down
[1:48:00] the bottom oh but what type of suitcase
[1:48:02] is it yeah i'll fall on the suitcase and
[1:48:04] then you wake up and you think what on
[1:48:06] earth am i talking about
[1:48:08] i can't sleep i'm losing sleep thinking
[1:48:10] about the suitcase this is just this is
[1:48:12] silly this is insane and then you you
[1:48:15] start to go back to sleep again and you
[1:48:16] start to think the same thing you think
[1:48:17] wow that suitcase well you're on i
[1:48:19] better not fall into that suitcase it'll
[1:48:21] the lip will flip up
[1:48:23] and you can do that all night just when
[1:48:25] you come to yourself you think this is
[1:48:27] random what am i thinking
[1:48:29] but it's because
[1:48:30] it's because there's a war going on in
[1:48:32] your body you've got a conflict going on
[1:48:33] this this there's some sort of germ or
[1:48:35] something coming and and then your your
[1:48:38] good cells your white blood cells
[1:48:40] everything it's it's fighting there's a
[1:48:42] there's a fight going on in your body
[1:48:44] that's why you're you know you're you're
[1:48:46] a you've got a temperature and you're an
[1:48:47] upheaval because there's a battle going
[1:48:49] on
[1:48:50] but
[1:48:51] god wants to give us peace in our body
[1:48:53] he wants to give us if we've got some
[1:48:55] ailment god actually wants to give us
[1:48:57] peace he doesn't want that he doesn't
[1:48:58] want this thing warring against us in
[1:49:00] and to make us sick god's desire for us
[1:49:03] is that we would have peace in our body
[1:49:04] that we would be well so and that's his
[1:49:06] promise now there's little things about
[1:49:09] that but you know if you want to you can
[1:49:10] claim that for yourself if there's
[1:49:12] something in your body you can proclaim
[1:49:13] peace
[1:49:14] and that was actually my word for the
[1:49:16] church this morning is is actually peace
[1:49:18] amongst all this conflict peace
[1:49:21] if you've got any if you've got any
[1:49:23] album in your body or anything like that
[1:49:24] and you you can you can claim the
[1:49:26] promise of god you can claim peace in
[1:49:28] your body next one
[1:49:30] you can have peace in your family you
[1:49:32] know like
[1:49:33] in a family situation sometimes you can
[1:49:35] start to have conflict and
[1:49:38] jesus says we're not immune to that he
[1:49:39] said he said don't think that i've come
[1:49:41] to bring peace but a sword and that
[1:49:43] sounds like an oxymoron like he's
[1:49:44] contradicting himself but he said i
[1:49:46] haven't come to bring peace with the
[1:49:47] sword but a sword i've come to bring you
[1:49:49] know between um
[1:49:50] um mother and daughter and father and
[1:49:52] son and all these things because
[1:49:55] because and sometimes he's doing that to
[1:49:57] test us because when you get two
[1:49:59] different ideas dwelling together if
[1:50:00] they are different you're going to have
[1:50:01] conflict that's why saying i've got i'm
[1:50:03] going to bring a sword if suddenly the
[1:50:05] the
[1:50:06] daughter decides she wants to serve the
[1:50:08] lord and if the mother is not into it
[1:50:10] you're suddenly were you son where you
[1:50:12] had peace you now have conflict you have
[1:50:13] a sword and you have what they call it
[1:50:15] you have a sword in the home you've got
[1:50:17] a conflict there because there's now a
[1:50:19] battle and jesus says don't be surprised
[1:50:22] we're often tempted to compromise and
[1:50:24] just given the battle because we want to
[1:50:25] have peace in the family so i'll just a
[1:50:27] lot of people have given up christianity
[1:50:29] they've given up a certain stance
[1:50:30] because they want to have peace they'll
[1:50:32] compromise for the sake of having peace
[1:50:33] but that's not peace they've just had to
[1:50:35] surrender to the enemy and actually
[1:50:38] they won't get peace that they won't get
[1:50:40] the peace of god that way but you know
[1:50:42] god has promised us regardless of what
[1:50:44] our situation might be go back so that's
[1:50:46] not that one
[1:50:47] god
[1:50:48] go before that god has promised us peace
[1:50:50] you know in our family we can have peace
[1:50:53] if there is conflict
[1:50:54] his power can come in and create peace
[1:50:56] in our family
[1:50:58] if there's someone walking the other way
[1:50:59] god can change turn that around and give
[1:51:01] you peace and that's what his desire for
[1:51:03] us is peace if you need that peace you
[1:51:05] can claim that peace now just like
[1:51:08] david's battle sometimes david didn't go
[1:51:10] to fight anyone straight away but he he
[1:51:11] always believed god is my victory in
[1:51:13] every situation god is my victory and
[1:51:15] sometimes things that happen overnight
[1:51:17] but we can keep pressing on and proclaim
[1:51:19] peace god is going to give me peace in
[1:51:21] the situation he's going to overcome and
[1:51:22] he's going to give me peace and we don't
[1:51:25] have to compromise with the enemy and
[1:51:26] say well i'll just give in and you know
[1:51:28] we don't have to compromise we can
[1:51:30] demand that we overcome and then there's
[1:51:32] peace in our land next one
[1:51:35] and the same goes you know we often
[1:51:38] i
[1:51:39] we can sometimes go through financial
[1:51:41] conflict you know the the
[1:51:43] the woman
[1:51:44] in the bible she was that that owed the
[1:51:47] debt she was in a
[1:51:49] in a financial conflict and there were
[1:51:51] people coming to i think they were
[1:51:52] coming to get take her son and sell him
[1:51:55] and you know she she had lost everything
[1:51:57] and she was in a there was people
[1:51:59] were at war with her and to overcome her
[1:52:02] but
[1:52:03] but god stepped in and said no i'm going
[1:52:04] to give you peace
[1:52:06] and he said yeah just start filling get
[1:52:08] all the oil that you can find and stuff
[1:52:10] just pour oil into these however many
[1:52:12] barrels you can find and go and sell
[1:52:14] that and pay all your creditors and pay
[1:52:15] everything i'm going to overcome this
[1:52:16] and give you peace thank you and god
[1:52:19] gave her peace brother
[1:52:21] brother peregrine said that brother
[1:52:22] branham told him there's no pressure
[1:52:24] like financial pressure and sometimes
[1:52:26] god gets us into financial pressure just
[1:52:28] to to take us through things but
[1:52:30] ultimately he wants to give us peace he
[1:52:31] doesn't want creditors on us and give us
[1:52:34] a conflict in the area he wants to give
[1:52:36] us peace so that we can live peaceably
[1:52:38] in that so if you if you've got that in
[1:52:40] your life anything at all you give you
[1:52:42] he'll give you he's a god of peace you
[1:52:44] can have peace in your mind
[1:52:46] philippians 4 7 says in the peace oh in
[1:52:48] this one
[1:52:50] and the peace
[1:52:51] of god which passeth all understanding
[1:52:53] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[1:52:54] christ jesus isaiah 26 3 says they will
[1:52:57] keep him in perfect peace whose mind has
[1:52:59] stayed on thee we live in a world where
[1:53:01] there's no peace people are people don't
[1:53:03] dwell peacefully but their minds are all
[1:53:05] caught up and worried but
[1:53:06] but god is the blessing of god gives us
[1:53:09] complete peace the peace of god which
[1:53:11] passes all understanding keeps our
[1:53:13] hearts and minds
[1:53:15] he will keep us in perfect peace if our
[1:53:17] mind has stayed on him and if we trust
[1:53:18] in him we'll be it regardless of how
[1:53:20] much this conflict happens around us and
[1:53:22] all this even in our country there's
[1:53:23] conflict there's division we don't care
[1:53:25] we're at total peace that's the god that
[1:53:28] we serve
[1:53:30] and the word that i want to speak to you
[1:53:32] speak over the church and give to the
[1:53:34] church if you remember one thing from
[1:53:35] today is shalom
[1:53:37] shalom i think that's a nice greeting we
[1:53:39] should start saying it to each other
[1:53:40] shalom because shalom means peace amen
[1:53:43] shalom it means peace and it means more
[1:53:46] than peace it means the peace the
[1:53:48] goodness the wholesomeness everything
[1:53:49] that god has be upon you the blessing
[1:53:51] and that because with with shalom
[1:53:55] comes
[1:53:56] with the peace of god with it's it's
[1:53:58] like may god's favor be upon you may his
[1:54:01] may everything that god has come upon
[1:54:02] you and give you peace give you
[1:54:05] make you
[1:54:06] know bless you and overcome you so that
[1:54:07] you become in this place of peace
[1:54:10] and if we can accept it and we just we
[1:54:13] just believe it god will give us shalom
[1:54:15] in every area of our life
[1:54:17] and i've got some a few scriptures i
[1:54:18] want to read about that this is gideon
[1:54:20] after god had told him you know he had
[1:54:22] all the enemies coming after him and
[1:54:24] always he was having to hide away and
[1:54:26] hide all the stuff from the enemy
[1:54:28] because he was oppressed and the angel
[1:54:29] came to him and said gideon now mighty
[1:54:31] man of valor and he told him he was
[1:54:32] going to deliver him and he built an
[1:54:34] altar that day and he called it jehovah
[1:54:36] shalom
[1:54:37] god of peace because he knew god
[1:54:39] promised he's going to give me peace
[1:54:41] god has got to give me peace from all
[1:54:43] these enemies that are coming at me
[1:54:44] every day
[1:54:45] there's going to be a season there's
[1:54:47] going to be a time
[1:54:48] that i can sit back and i can be at
[1:54:50] peace and i won't have all these enemies
[1:54:52] coming and i won't have to hide in here
[1:54:53] anymore and hide away all my
[1:54:55] my harvest from them and for fear
[1:54:57] they're going to steal i'm going to be
[1:54:58] in a place of peace
[1:55:00] and god has proclaimed peace to each one
[1:55:02] of us
[1:55:03] every one of us and that's it we need to
[1:55:05] start saying that to each other when we
[1:55:06] greet because the jews say that they say
[1:55:08] shalom instead of
[1:55:10] it's not hello
[1:55:11] and they speak peace i think that's a
[1:55:13] nice way to greet each other and when
[1:55:14] they say goodbye they say shalom
[1:55:17] shalom i've taken a few scriptures
[1:55:19] because the when we write peace in the
[1:55:22] bible it's actually in the in the
[1:55:24] english that's actually the word shalom
[1:55:26] you know it's this word it's not so i've
[1:55:28] got
[1:55:28] two scriptures to finish with shalom i
[1:55:31] leave with you my shalom i give unto you
[1:55:33] not as the will giveth i give unto you
[1:55:35] let not your heart be troubled neither
[1:55:36] let it be afraid so god says shalom i
[1:55:39] leave with you my shalom my peace i give
[1:55:42] unto you not as the will give not as
[1:55:45] well giveth give unto you let not your
[1:55:46] heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:55:48] afraid he always said shalom when he was
[1:55:50] when he walked on the water and the
[1:55:51] disciples were scared he always said
[1:55:53] shalom or when an angel came to visit
[1:55:55] someone he said fear not shalom even
[1:55:57] that word fear not means it's
[1:55:59] a lot of the times that's that's
[1:56:01] translated from shalom
[1:56:03] shalom be at peace don't worry just be
[1:56:05] at peace
[1:56:06] here's my last scripture for today then
[1:56:07] we'll close
[1:56:09] now the lord of shalom
[1:56:11] himself
[1:56:12] gave you shalom always by all means
[1:56:15] the lord be with you all
[1:56:18] the god of shalom the god of peace
[1:56:20] himself he's he owns it it's it's part
[1:56:22] of his domain
[1:56:24] he owns this thing and it says may he
[1:56:26] give it to you always may he give you
[1:56:28] his shalom his peace
[1:56:30] by all means by any means that he can
[1:56:31] may he get it to you if there's an area
[1:56:34] in your life where you don't have peace
[1:56:35] i want to encourage you you can stand
[1:56:37] upon the word of god and he will give
[1:56:38] you peace
[1:56:39] don't don't give up don't don't doubt
[1:56:41] the promises of god
[1:56:43] sometimes battles are overnight
[1:56:44] sometimes they last a long time but
[1:56:46] don't doubt the promises of god he'll
[1:56:48] give you peace because he is the god of
[1:56:49] peace and if we
[1:56:50] commit our lives over to him in every
[1:56:53] area of our life he'll give us peace i
[1:56:55] can guarantee you i can assure you of
[1:56:57] that because he is the god of peace
[1:56:59] now the lord of shalom himself give you
[1:57:01] shalom always by all means
[1:57:03] the lord be with you amen thank you
