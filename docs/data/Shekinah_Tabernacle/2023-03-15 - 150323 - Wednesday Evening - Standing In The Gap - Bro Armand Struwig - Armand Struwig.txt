[Music] oh I was decision and I was Glory from somewhere deep inside [Music] cry [Music] it's only I could fly and I believe the world that I had Earth [Music] everything is [Music] every situations whatever comes my way I I have a peace with Jesus flying above the storm there is a joy within me now that I'm sorry really your word has Set Me Free I'm flying above that's always [Music] told me I could fly and I believe the words [Music] amen we heard an eagle cry you said look up and we looked up and since that day we never looked down come trials and tribulations come everything we just keep walking amen some days are easy we FL we feel like we're flying right up there and the wind's pushing and everything's easy and the other days we feel like we we're going through Thunder and hail and lightning and and it's hard but you know what I heard an eagle cry you know and that eagle only really cries when he's calling you and he calls you by name amen and he called each one of us by name and guess what we're here because when God calls your name it is a finished work but see the names in the book he has to call as much as we want to do it in ourselves he has to do the calling amen God bless you Saints we're just going to open up in a word of prayer you can play this while we're praying and say Lord Jesus we come here before you tonight Lord we are nothing Lord but the dust of the earth which you formed us from Lord but see Lord there is one difference between us Lord and the rest of this world you breast your life into us you've placed your Holy Spirit within us Lord it doesn't make us anything more special father it makes us even more thankful Lord that you would be so mindful Lord that when we get together Lord more of God is in this place Lord we don't try to figure it out we don't try to reason it out we just say Lord thank you thank you that you were mindful Lord that before even time began we were in your thoughts Lord and we got expressed through the spoken word and we just find ourselves right here now tonight all these lovely brothers and sisters that love you that seeking our answer from you that's that's coming for a question or a request Lord Jesus Lord you see where our pastor is even overseas now Lord today he will start preaching there and he will share the message with brother Pedro Lord and we know Lord you have called them to that assembly for a reason and they are faithful to the vision Lord and they walking now we just ask Lord that you would just be mindful of your servant father let his words not fall to the ground my lord lord May the words that he speaks set out and Achieve that which it has accomplished father and may that word not return to you void as well as tonight father it is not man's ideas I don't know the service will go Lord you know my heart I have prepared I've done all I can Lord but now we need you to speak my father so I pray that each one of us here in the Pew tonight each one year in the Church Father May our hearts be surrendered to what you want to say to us tonight and may we not leave your change in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen musicians you can have your seat and all of us will still stand or you can stand but you can go that way I did it last time and everybody sat down kind of backfired of me children it's not communion so don't worry see look I can't fight it I like surprises I am I am the worst when it comes to surprises you know like at Christmas time when I still grew up I used to wrap my socks and put it under the Christmas tree so I have more gifts than everyone else I knew the weight of the gifts I knew the size of the gifts I knew which one rattled I knew which one made what funny sounds I knew everything about every gift under that tree because I'm very curious and I love it and it's a good way to be but it has a balance okay so you little ones when I open this up you can come to the front end and take a seat so you can see closer or if you want to sit where you are it's fine I mean the adults might just be a bit too tall and you can't see and so this is for you and adults this is for for us as well amen so let's go to Second uh well sorry first Peter and we're gonna go to First Peter or and the second chapter and we're going to start there from verse number five so second our first Peter second chapter verse number five so you children can come forward come now you wouldn't believe it what I was going to preach about about wisdom versus faith and I had it all figured out I got the whole sermon everything done man you should see this is so wonderful I've got everything set and I thought that's me and then the law dropped the sword into my heart and I thought if I don't speak about it right now I'll be very disobedient and I might get into trouble so I know what I know but I don't know how to put it together so please bear with me for this one as I believe is for us for now right now amen so it's not going to be a fighting sermon but we we're going to sober up a little bit he says thee in verse 5 he says he also as living stones are built upon the spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer a spiritual sacrifice as acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lie in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth amim shall not be confounded you and unto you therefore and I just want to say that that verse sixes you will never ever be disappointed in believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and serving him never amen unto you therefore which believe is is he precious but unto them which is disobedient the stone which the Buddhist disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and the stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word so they stumble at the word they cannot take the full word there is something in them when the word comes they have to reject it they just have to because they take a offense so whatever you come with and I don't want to jump ahead but whatever comes to them becomes an offense it becomes a pushback it's not saying God can't deal with them but they'll really take a offense so the attitude of that person is the moment you say hey how about this they go it's a very bad place to be because you cut off Mercy there is a red line and you cut that off because you choose to stand on the wrong side of that long line willingly don't do that you know rather take it on the chin and go talk it out with our Lord Jesus Christ and do this because when you do that I'm telling you now there's a trial coming and that trial is going to be because you are a son and daughter of God God will get you in the place but he's going to take you through something to reveal to you himself so if ever you children Betty and mommy says to you something don't do that don't do it take it brother sisters taken and then if it if it burns you inside take it to the Lord and say Lord I don't understand this please show me and it will be a much different Road you walk than when you reject that word amen and the stone of stumbling and a rock of a fence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient with also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that use you so forth the Praises of him that called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light to show forth the Praises of him who called you and out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light amen you may have your seats brothers and sisters which in times past were not a people but now are the people of God which God not obtained Mercy but now you have obtained mercy so there was something we were never really in the economy of God the Gentiles though he knew he was going to take a bride he dealt with Israel as a nation okay he deals with us as a person so now I want to say when God deals with you he ain't gonna deal with your mom and dad and the brother next to you and that one to give to you he's going to come to you personally but see he needs these things on the earth though he can speak through a tree he can speak through a wind brother Branham said he was there was a a whirlwind in the tree when he grew up and that will when there's a voice that came out of it and it scared him and he used to walk like miles around that tree because he got scared and he says don't defile your body so if God wants to speak to you he can but he does choose man and he's always done that but there's a thing that people Miss in this age God only reveals his word for that age to a prophet children I hope you understand what I say now God only reveals his word and puts you in time through a prophet doesn't do it any other way we'll never do it any other way that's how God does it he did it for Israel he will do it for us and he's going to do it being again for Israel so he cannot change the get God cannot change so brother Branham always said and I wonder if somebody can help me out God is the same today and forever so do you actually know what you're saying does it sink in so can God change his mind God but is God merciful so who knows what's a box law yeah raise up your hands okay that's fine so sometimes you don't get a box law but that you still deserve it though you did the wrong so you just you just found Mercy you should have got it but Dad said you know what do not we ain't gonna go there so I'm way off my notes but I've got I know the Lord has got this one just hang in there so sometimes we do something and we don't deserve it and we get punished how does that feel so we do something good and all of a sudden we're in trouble and you're like how did I get yeah I remember I was mowing the law loan one day I'll never forget it picked up a stone flicked it through a window my dad shall know because I got the hiding for that okay well pox law but I really didn't do it but all the other 150 times when the shot was done with a cricket ball I hit it through the window but this one time he gave me a hiding when I said it was really a lawnmower and he didn't believe me and I got one I was really offended because I didn't do it wrong but the other times I did something wrong I never got a hiding so do you think it's just balancing everything out so the Lord won't take you and not give ear and won't give here not and not give there he makes sure that everything's balances so if you ever owe somebody anything and you don't really know about it God will bring some way and somehow to balance it out okay he's always going to bring the balance that's our God but now we're going to talk tonight and we need a tea subject but I want to jump into this brother Branham says here in the anointed ones at the end time so I went and I wanted to talk to you tonight about Cora and dathan who knows that story okay the whole thing about Cora and Nathan is the chapter is this long 45 verses or 42 verses so if we really jump into that it's going to take a very long time so I thought I'll tell you the story but I'll give you some homework who likes homework yeah you'll be the first one I do not like homework okay homework is hard so you're going to find a story homework who likes homework Gabby you can do all my homework okay I'll give it to you freely in the Book of Numbers it's numbers and number 16. okay so number 16 is where we find a story and it has 50 verses to be honest to get to the right bottom of it but what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly tell you the story because I actually want to come to this part but my whole theme for tonight is standing in the gap interceding on someone's behalf you know like in a nice way taking the punch when you were not supposed to take the punch being the less and not being the most I wonder who how many times do we have to Humble ourselves not to be the coolest you know and at this subject tonight is going to be very cool but we're going to we're going to put him through some trials okay amen and Marion is elected to be that this subject on his behalf I that just wonderful so here comes Cora and and um Nathan and Ian verse number 16 verses one to three it says now Korah and the sons of um uzar the sons of Korah the sons of the Levi and dathan and and uh Abram the sons of elab man these names A and on the sons of pileth the sons of Reuben took men and they rose up before Moses with a certain of the children of Israel 250. okay 250 princes of the assembly famous and in the congregation of men of renown so when they went to to Moses to go and murmur and complain they didn't just go and say hey okay listen oh yeah you don't like Moses I'll take you and you think he's not the only one and I'll take you no no no no they had a meeting and they got all the people that had a bit of ranking in Israel so these were I would say devout men but with Street Creed who knows what street cred is huh they had a bit of they had a bit of a a a uh how can I say a legacy to them people knew them they knew them because they said they were famous and renowned that means that when they walked down the street they said oh there goes brother cubain there goes brother Isaac he writes all those cool songs you know oh there he goes brother Ed he can lift the car with this Pinky you know like I'm just Hey listen I want to make it fun because if you go do this homework and you say Lord reveal it to me the attitude of these people when they went to Moses is they didn't go and say hey Moses we need your counsel about this they built their army and they were going to go to him and say Hey you are not the only Holy One that's exactly what happened there and how they go to the next part they say seemeth it but a small thing to you that God of Israel has separated you now remember they were Levites so they were serving in in God's house okay but they weren't the priesthood so if you remember our opening scripture said your a Royal you are different by default you're different your commission is different your position is different you're not the denomination you are actually a very important person and your job title is crucial to what you're going to do so you don't serve God you don't just Minister because the Levites was ministering in the house of God so they they were ministering the house of God and they were people that know the word but a priesthood is someone that the word goes through it's totally different so Aaron was the prophet he was the priesthood for that time and Moses was God because remember Moses God said to Moses you be God and Aaron be your prophet and you go into Egypt so now when they came out and they were leading God would speak first person to Moses and then says hey tell Aaron to go do that but see these people if you read that they had a problem with Aaron and they had a problem with Moses because every time Moses said thus say of the Lord then they said oh but who made you King and they say yeah they say this when they when they walked up to him and I'll go to that scripture and this is this is something that kind of burned me because the the whole point of the story and I'll try to go fast is they said to this they rose up against him and said and they all gathered themselves together against Moses verse 3 and against Aaron and they said unto him ye'd take too much upon you seeing all the congregation Are Holy what a bunch of Lies so we all are holy you know think about when you look at the nominations today you can be whatever you want to be I'm gonna go a little bit off an attention you can be whatever you can be a flower pot and call yourself a flower pot but as long as you love God you're okay you can reason all the colors of the rainbow we're all the the nose rings and earrings and things and everything you can do all that love God you'll be okay of course we're all holy what a lie a bunch of nonsense because Balaam started that lie and he was a prophet and he prophesied correct but he started to lie and they believed the lie and now they wanted to bring that lie under that 250 people to to Moses so that Moses would give them free Reign Over Israel and and brother Brennan picks it up and he says and I'm going to go to that quote now and he sees this I want you to hear how serious the God's Prophet was about this he says um oh you false teachers listening to these tapes all these years and seeing God confirm exactly what he said and in your study you know the truth and because of you the dominational differences you dispute them and tell the people they are not so saying that we're all holy but that's not for you and baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not for you and days of Miracles are passed so then our friends and I'll leave that story right there because I want to get to this but I want to now say standing in the Gap follow my thought so people lie in the name of God and come with a lot of sincerity but they deny this the word of God they deny this because what they say is if God could speak to brother Branham then God could speak to me and I can show you the same Mysteries but that's not how God works it I hope you understand we needed a prophet in this age because the prophet pointed us back to the word of God there's no other way all the other denominations are sincere people the system is corrupt they're sincere people but but inside them say they're so confused that they're all all right and we're all going to go to heaven but there's judgment hanging over them and brother Branham says Balaam Anointed with the same Spirit was upon Moses what was the difference the teaching of Moses is perfect because God Vindicated it okay the Bible said in second Peter that the teaching of Balaam and Israel received and God never forget that Uncle most sin not one of them was saved they all had to come under the blessing of God see and at the hand of God they had to move by the mighty prophet and see it exactly Vindicated by God and because other Prophet came with the teaching country and disputed with Moses he tried to prove by the people that Moses was wrong and dathan and Korah and many of them agreed with him and taught the children to commit fornications to go after organizations and we are all the same that's what they said we're all holy but brother Branham sees this he says we are not the same you are a separated people wholly unto the Lord dedicated to the word and the spirit of God to bear fruit in his promise of this day you are not one of them you are I know it's awful strong but that is the truth just the same dedicate to a service in the last days come out amongst them now he says we dedicated for a service well so what means this we dedicated for a service so now I'm gonna I'm gonna need assistance from Brother Marion because um he said he will do it when he couldn't say he couldn't do it amen okay brother martin you could come I hope you're ready for this [Laughter] okay so now remember your friend Marion is in a denomination he must listen I'm not saying they're bad people I'm saying they're in a system where they're caught and in this system they truly think they know who they are okay I did ask brother keep in if I could put a cap on it brother could be and said it's fine so he knows who I am okay you know you are you okay so remember your denomination but now see look we are looking out from the inside we are those Eagles that's soaring up in the heavenlies that got the full word rev revealed to us what a privilege what a privilege do you have you actually know what the seals mean you know the E seals when I was in the seriously when I was in denomination a seal was something they out in the beach it goes or or I didn't even know what a seal in the book was I didn't even know the book was closed I don't even know the book was open instead I didn't even know what this book means of course Samson was just a story okay Daniel in the Lion's Den are come on but I never understood the anointing of God but it took a prophet to come and tell me but wait there's more and if you listen to the prayer lines where brother Branham goes and starts Discerning and God works through brother Branham not brother Branham God works through the prophet and start Discerning the thoughts and intent of heart you would know who stepped on that that platform it was deity and he would tell people you that standing here do you feel that presence that's not me that is him okay so now we've got this we got the whole word okay but this man unfortunately because he's so cool he's blinded sorry Marion you must tell me if you're totally blinded okay wait wait we have to open that up can you breathe okay are you blind yeah yeah can you see my hand oh no okay sorry don't worry and he still thinks he's cool okay he's still cool because I can do whatever I want okay because I know who I am but there's another thing this man is also Bound by traditions and laws of men and false doctrines and these guys that just don't want to see eye to eye because one doesn't believe in one God and the other one believes in three and the other one believes in 150 and all those things and the denominations all know what they know when one sees it's the Apostles Creed and the other one says sprinkling by water so all these rules got this man died down Marion remember all those hunting trips you take me on and the suffering I had to endure for you foreign and because it's in the service because you're bound by traditions and laws of men okay who can help me bind this guy come here come here I want to listen come turn him around avika hold on hold on keep cut keep turning this guy yes turn turn he does just just he just feels so free still tell me when you feel like a restricted a bit okay keep going baby keep going keep going I'm not running out of the Rope yet yes he's good okay now I'll have to find a town down Point okay cool thanks Apes so how does that feel you feel a bit tied up hey I luckily I can't make not so whoever's going to free you after this I don't know how it's gonna go but amen you know what just sit still and now just to make sure you don't really know where you are because guess what the prophet never showed you which age you're in so you know you're going to heaven but you just don't know when you don't know when he was coming down you don't know where you are you don't know even where the Rapture is but guess what we're pointing in the right direction now we're gonna do some experimenting with Prada Marion okay but now you are an intercessor you are my gods in diseases so you're gonna have to use your tools you're gonna have to use the sermon you're gonna have to make sure that what is coming now towards this Marion is good for him because guess what you looking out for your brother he might be bound can you put that picture up he might be confused he might be all bound up in everything he looks like that boy there I want you to get a burden for what we're facing because I think people think this is a game I know I make illustrations but I want you to understand there is children your age out there that spiritually is looking like that alone don't know where they are don't know where they're going don't even know the next meal don't don't know who's God don't know if he's a God or not they actually have no idea where they're at but there's you these these you and when you read that scripture when it says you're a royal priesthood he says he at the end he says having your uh it says here in verse 9 it says and the chosen Jesus generation royal priesthood the holy night and a peculiar people which should sow forth the praises to Him that call you out of Darkness where this man was unto His Marvelous Light and you have obtained Mercy dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstained from fleecially lust that Wars against the soul so there's a expectation from you as a believer in Christ to help this man which thinks he knows who he is the coolest dude on the Block tied up in sin he doesn't have a way out he doesn't know the way out so now we're going to reveal to you what he's going to eat because you know what I believe is you are what you eat so how many of you and this is a personal question how many of you is reading your Bible every day do not answer me how many of you is feeding off the word every day every day how many how many doesn't just pray and talk to God but actually has a relationship to God so we're going to start with this one I want you to say loud no if I can give it to him or not the deal is it is sweet in your mouth and bitter in your belly listen to me it needs to go in his mouth and it needs to be able to make it to your belly belly so I'll explain it to you I just want a loud yes or no can we give it to him to eat to eat should we try should we not try it it looks like open your mouth yeah it's big enough no so we can't give him this okay okay I'll explain it after I told him what he's going to eat because I don't want to spoil it for him but can we give him this oh really it do you know what this is oh yeah so Mario is feeling very so I can give him this one I want to give him this one Marian if I say to you they don't want you to eat this would you want to eat it so is that your final answer do you want to find a friend you are correct you cannot eat that it's rubbish it's garbage it's social media it is the worst form of anything you can sit on your phone the whole day long and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat but Jesus says here and Jesus said unto them very verily I say unto you you say Moses gave you not the bread from heaven but my father giveth it to you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is which cometh down from heaven and given life unto all the unto the world then he said to them Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said to him I am the bread okay so do you want to take a hoppy or do you trust me okay up so how's that taste don't speak with food in your mouth okay social media time on YouTube okay kids love it Go chameleon anything that would waste your time I want you to understand you can start off with me and brother eight spoke about it this week you can start off with this and it can take you down a rabbit hole and before you find it you were three and a half hours on the internet and have no idea what are you looking at now and even why this is rubbish rubbish there is a real tablet in there I don't care this life but see this poor brother really wants to serve God but we want to stick that in his mouth and say it's acceptable but you all just said he can't eat it but we're eating it isn't it okay I didn't say it was going to be a nice one tonight I just said it's going to be there now this one is a tricky one so I need you guys he looks thirsty because he had a big bread now Davey would definitely see this one do you think you should drink this one okay sister Shannon put on your discernment cap do you think you should drink this one amen do you think this is good for him really should I show you it's not good for him do you can I open it for him sister Shannon can I open it there is one that's making an intercession is a couple that's having fun this man's life is at stake this is like one and a half bar pressure straight in his face do you think he wants that do you think he wants to drink this yes he wants to drink a Davey but do you think he should drink it okay so Marion do you want to drink this one David said David said you can huh didn't you what should he drink this one okay thank you Davey you could see you had a change but this man is thirsty do you think you should drink that [Music] yeah okay Marion have a superior bro you look thirsty I don't know what it is but good luck no it's water okay so now Ephesians 5. it says here for husbands is the head of the wife and Christ is the head of the church and um and he is the savior of the body amen there as the church is subject unto Christ so let your wives be unto the husbands and everything husbands love your wives and Christ also love the church and give give himself for it that ye might Sanctified and be cleansed with the washing of the water of the I gained this this one so again here we go Satan's seed God seed okay I'm not saying don't drink it don't don't hold on here I'm just saying is there is much better things to drink out there it is still your choice what you drink and what you put in but all of us agree that this is good for him so you have to go against that to say this is not good for you and then still do it so against the word amen and I'm talking spiritual I hope your spiritual caps are on okay this one Marion guy do you think he can eat this one people spend so much time chasing this thing around Mario you don't know what you're eating guy do you want to give it a go it's it smell smell it's green like an apple smells good it's good soft well ish maybe it tastes like a I can't tell you so do you want to eat it smell it it smells real nice hey it's me do you think Marion should eat this [Laughter] should I give him a go Marion lelia says she's your best friend she wants you to eat this biggest fan biggest fan but who's got some discernment but jono says such a party pooper what do you want to do it's tasty it's green example if you want to try it because that's how Satan works are you sure man it's green it's got like little funny it's like almost like a feijoa just not quite a feijoa okay but I've got something else I got the real deal okay do you think you should eat this does it look legit do you want to take a happy day and just try for me oh who wants to taste and see Abram do you want to taste and see give that one a go you have little faith who wants to taste and see do you want to try it this is not a trick question do you want to try that go for it is it the real deal amen by your fruits you'll know they may okay now Marion everybody else says should he eat it or not should he eat it or not okay so your best friend in the corner there Noelle says you shouldn't but who's got the sermon Mo should I eat it or not so I'm not picking on you I thank you that you do it because this is led by the Lord you think you should eat it so Moses you should eat it he doesn't like you much I'm pretty sure he wants your position in the band as a guitar player so she can do it better hey but no else he goes no I know this guy he can he can have it of course you shouldn't eat it so uh which one do you believe Mo or your best friend in the oven in the corner do you well open up good luck tell me what you taste it's not I say oh what is it do you know it's a grape okay and this I pray thee hear this out that the love may abound yet more and more knowledge and enjoy in all judgment that ye may approve things and have um that are excellent and that they may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which is which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God and then it goes on to say but the fruits of the spirit is love peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance and against such is no law okay Samarian you dodge the bullet demon I was going to give you a tennis ball so the wonderful thing is we could have given him this tennis ball which people run up and down the track the whole day fall they make these funny sounds when they hear it as well he's like karate okay and they get millions of dollars doing this and they are super cool but it's still a tennis ball thank you brother it's a tennis ball it's not going to get you one iota closer to God not one in fact you're gonna practice and you're gonna be so dedicated to that little green ball that is going to take you further away from God I'm not saying tennis on a Saturday is wrong get the balance guys I say if that is what you're eating and what you're feeding off and what all is just there by you is this is all you can see is playing this game and you make it all that you have guess what you'll never be the fruits of the spirit because you're bearing the fruits of the world because this is only entertainment same as the tablet amen we're almost there guys now this one I'm gonna need some super discernment I might even call a deacons helping this is a glass of something one you're gonna drink a one you're gonna eat so if you should choose this is not a three question what is your heart's desire my brother right your left or my left your right okay your lift so which is this side okay so everybody do we want to give Mario on this one or do we want to give Marion this one [Music] yeah this is South African thing okay Marion all the people say you can have what's in my left hand which is either one's the right hand I always get it confused do you want my left hand or do you want my right hand okay now this one is going to be a little bit tough because sometimes you just have to chew the fat can you bite there for me can you get in there can you can you try to get that come on come on just go halfway get in there you just dragged me up a hill to go get this thing you might as well just eat it he's struggling okay wait wait take this one this is a better one leave that one leave it take that one bite scrape it off what do you think this is ah there we go what do you want some more hey man of course where the carcasses is the Eagles gather okay so we don't want some semi-skimmed milk that has been pasteurized and digitalized and watered down water because used to when I shake milk it actually had a bit of a layer of cream that's all gone now it's just so been processed that is not good for you it's skimmed milk it's this God loves you oh and if he loves you you can do whatever you want as long as you say I'm sorry he'll forgive you because he's just and it's true he will forgive you but not if you keep on doing what you're doing but good meat a sound Doctrine means that there is something more in you that will ground you to the word not some fairy tales and some hallelujahs and a fancy song on YouTube okay all Hillsong songs and all those things if you only live by songs you won't get anywhere let me tell you if most of your day is spinning listening to music and not reading your Bible you are going into the tribulation brother Bradham said the spirit of rock and roll is going to lead that that people into the tribulation and the spirit of rock and roll is in music so if you find yourself only listening to music and all the other stuff even if it's Godly music and you don't feed off the word and you don't take sound Doctrine and you don't know why the prophet said what is Satan's seed and where he begins and how he goes through the lineages and why the seven Messengers and why was one sent to you if you don't go and look for it in the message you don't get anywhere because you're not feeding and giving substance for what's coming and this is what's the problem with these guys is they can't take sound Doctrine because it goes against their reasoning of course we like to reason God away I can't just accept baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I can't just accept it in the Garden of Eden it wasn't an apple that she ate it was a sex deed I can't accept it because it doesn't fall with my pastor but I would like to tell you that that Pastor is not going to stand right next to you at the day of judgment you alone will so it's maybe time we start eating some meat getting some substance amen okay we're almost there now Mario you're getting a fiery trial right now so this is my next ones but this is not a choice this is not a choice I want to shake this man out of this condition so me as God we say and I don't say I'm God just give me I'm representing just just follow the thought line I want my child to return back to me but see the bride is not doing a job by starting to talk to this person but now we are now we're starting to realize hey that breed is good for me the water is good for me the V Energy Drink is not going to cut it and as the preaching comes and as you fellowship with his brother not enemy you start washing him you start sanctifying him you start cleansing him because God is working through you with all your little friends at school when you say I love Jesus I follow Jesus there was a prophet in this day he told us how to overcome you don't have to say it like that just hear me out but you're going to have to stand for something because someone wants to see something real and when you say and when he listens to reggae Christian music or what does that other one that's so atrocious um rap Christian music for real life man rap Christian music rap comes out of the pit of Hell it has got nothing to do with God there is no such thing as rap and Christian music the spirit on that is epic devil everything amen because the spirit wants to have anger and aggression and all those things and then he thinks I love God sounds to me like Satan way back in the Garden of Eden even in heaven before he said oh you know I love God but hey guys follow me because I'm more beautiful that's rap but I thought this trial might not be fiery enough who wants to give Marion this who wants to because we want to shake him out of his condition okay so we really want to give him this we want to give him something hey do you know that in the Garden of Eden if it wasn't an apple that's this okay so but I thought of course it's Marion and he drags me up deals and he makes my legs hurt and he laughs and enjoys it with me I thought this one would be better Marion I want to get you just a little bit closer to the Lord and what I thought is this the right size yeah oh okay we see no no real no real compassion but hey it's the only one I can see so or maybe we can give him one of these how's that sir no okay I don't want to be like that okay Marion Here Comes Your trial your trial is fiery your trial is fiery and in this trial I want you to realize that I have called now and said my son stop your shenanigans okay you have had the word I want you to follow don't don't think about the moment now you had your word I'm speaking to you every day it's sweet in your mouth in your belly and sometimes you're just gonna have to take it if it's nice or not Marion can you sing this one away deep breathe bro how does that feel fiery now you would say I'm cruel you would say Hey brother man that's pretty cruel this man is look he's going I can take that off now Marion you know what you started to seeing like hey something else is going on in this trial okay I'm starting to realize that hey maybe I'm not all by myself and all these guys got me okay please follow me don't lose the thought now I'm really starting to know who I am okay and these little doctrines that the the guys say Hey you believe this and you believe that and you do this and you do that and you'll be saved it's nonsense because you know what the more than Marion is eating this word the more he's starting to realize that he is actually a free man but now I'm giving Mario on something else and say Mario and you just went through a trial bro and this trial was not nice was it like when I had to walk up that hill to try to shoot that deer right on the top remember that but guess what I learned from that trial Marion that there was a very nice reward at the end of that trial and you really and truly do know who you are you're a righteous Son of God God bless you can have a seat [Applause] now Marion I didn't forget about you I've got one test for you God is great now I want to tell you would you like some of this would you like some of that but I'm gonna say I'm gonna get your friends to talk to you so hey guys who wants to give money on this to eat shame of you if you said he has to eat it no Marion your best friend again says you shall eat it do you want to eat that or do you want to eat this amen amen so Mario on your knees what you bypass the trial and you just got honey that was on the Rock might take a while to come out because it looks like it's all hard but I'm gonna give you a little bit of this anyways because it will chase them that it's coming hold on guys pause for effect sometimes God's blessings take a time to get to you and you don't always understand why it takes so long because that other brother is just refusing to bring it to you straight away and you go God I don't understand this brother but man I'm just gonna love him anyways and everything he does for me tonight was not nice but you know what I know this uh expected end for me here you go Marion God bless you and now finish Marion was like that boy can you put that photo up again please that boy cannot see past his own eyes he's sitting in a straight jacket and his friends are enjoying it he's in pain he's crying out to God and His Friends that has the truth goes to him every day to school every day at work with him they're the best friend what he has on the soccer team on a Saturday they play cricket with him they don't go to the movies with him because they stand for something they don't drink with him they don't do what he does but they they how many of us really understands the responsibility that God has placed upon this children this royal priesthood so I'll explain this got swallowed up in the ground they're gone families all things Moses cried out before they go he says Lord just be merciful Ken you can't just kill everyone for one person Heart of Jesus Christ in him he says be merciful don't swallow them up he says okay you go back to the congregation and you tell that congregation to separate yourself from what they doing I hope you have your spiritual caps on children don't fall asleep now to separate yourself from what they doing because I'm gonna swallow them up so he goes back to the congregation and he warns them he rewards them he says guys there's a Rapture coming but with that Rapture as a Great Tribulation get out of the world and get into Christ and it came with thus save the Lord with healing in his wings and it was Vindicated and Vindicated and Vindicated and Vindicated and proven and proven and they didn't listen but these guys did listen and they came away from Quran Nathan and then the ground swallowed them up and then God says to Moses he says now Aaron will be the only one that can make intercession for these people placing him again in the priesthood position where he belongs Where We Are then the next day the people come back after this massive event and they start fighting with Aaron and Moses again and they say to him and go read it go read your Bible and they go to him and say you have brought us here to die you promised us that you will take us into the Promised Land we haven't seen the promised land because they're still dealing in the carnal realm they're not seeing what God is showing them okay so they're not looking at your friends as friends that is that maybe a love gift to God a child of God they're just seeing them as a friend and then God comes down into the Tabernacle and Moses and arrow goes stand Aaron because stands in front of the Tabernacle and God speaks to them and he says to them I'm going to kill them I'm going to destroy them all and the plague starts and Moses has the heart of Christ again and he grabs Aaron and he says take the the um the same the what do they call it the sensor take the fire off the Altar and run in the midst of the people and go make intercession for them and the plague stops rather being preached about it it made the biggest impression in my life about it never forget it if you want the plague of death in this world to stop you better be closer to your friends than ever you must pray for them you must ask God for them no well you prayed for your brother you pray for your sisters that is our duty that's why we're here there's no other reason why the children of God is on this Earth you didn't come here to have a great time though we have a great time we came here because God placed us here because he's going to use you to get someone into the kingdom of God you need to pray about it you need to read your word and you need to say to them have you seen and have you taste that the Lord is good and if you can do it then you are in your position and God can use you don't worry about how you're going to do it as long as you're available God will use you he doesn't say are you able he said are you available but most of the time all our nice friends that we have in the world and I've got heaps of them it's like Marion was here all tied up so blind by all this nonsense of doctrines and I can't pray for this one and this one believes that and you have the truth right in your hand right in your hand and say hey let's start just at the beginning of the book do you know that you were in the thoughts of God before you even set the first words do you know when creation began you didn't begin with it you already began when God thought of you start giving some seats back man see what happens soon soon you'll say hey don't drink that rubbish I'm not talking about a drink I'm talking about don't drink don't defile your body put water in it eat nutrients children if you're not reading your Bible and you spend too much time on this thing this device thing telling you now you cannot help your friend because you have no nutrients within yourself to be able to give to your friend you need to fear of the word we need all to fear of the word so that God can reach our friends and the ones and our loved ones my brother his wife her brother a little bit of a testimony the only way you're gonna get your brother your sister your dad your mom whoever to Christ get on your knees start talking to the Creator and watch how he moves Havens and Earth to get him in his position hi Davey amen musicians you can come forward so who wants to feed Mario on something though we had fun though

wastelord while we get involved with the world and the things of the world Lord but we know that you said that if the love of the world is in you and the things of the world that you look at then the love of God can't be in you father and we see that little boy that is all tied up and eyes closed and he just can't see night from day Lord he doesn't even know there's a light that is on that day could be shining right amongst him Lord the most glorious gospel light is shining all around him with the truth of this hour and of this day and he's totally blind to it Lord oh father but we have a responsibility my Lord who keeps shining our light Lord and keep sowing those seeds Lord and ask Lord that you would prepare the ground for us Lord because Lord we're just the laborers in your Harvest though you are the master the lord of the Harvest Lord you still say to those disciples who pray ye that the lord of the Harvest sends the laborers they still had a commission they still had to do something though you were the lord of the Harvest and you know you could do at any time you say to the disciples pray ye that the lord of the Harvest will send laborers in there father we still have something to do today and I pray each one of us may you prick us in our heart tonight Lord may you scratch a little bit of dirt off that hardness Lord the busyness of Life all the distractions Lord may you just cut a little piece open there Lord so that your light can shine in thee father and start revealing to us Lord that we need to be a different type of people a royal priesthood A peculiar people Lord that is not like the world that has joy unspeakable and full of glory Lord that knows that our God can heal that knows that Faith Lord is the substance and the evidence of things unseen that knows that when we claim a promise on your word father it will be done Lord we are that type of people we know as well Lord that every conversation is recorded my Lord and every conversation we have with someone Lord is for your kingdom Lord may it be good words we speak may it be Lord humble words we speak and Lord if there's ever a brother or sister or anybody in the world that's angry without and rough with us Lord they were the same with you when you were here because they couldn't take that word but may a soft answer turn away that wrath father may they still see deity Within These skins Lord within this Veil Lord I pray Lord as we go our separate ways tonight Lord we still live brother Ben you see Lord how he is on his post of Duty we see brother Peter O Lord Jesus going there with them Lord true man of God both of them Lord standing side by side like the disciples that you've seen out I pray Lord that miraculous things will happen Lord that the anointing of God would be so tangible Lord that they know that their very next breath could take them into eternity Lord Jesus may you find your bride that's within those churches may you bring them out of them because you said come out of her my people and then as we go our own way may we always remember the vision that the prophet told us he said the bride was in step but you started to look away and I came out of the vision when I said to her don't look away stay in line may we stay in line my Lord may you help us to stay in line my Lord and may we realize that when we stay in our light and we in our position father if we be lifted up all men shall be drawn unto you father because lord it's not us doing the lifting it's you my lord and that lifting up is not in Pride or in a in a boastful Spirit father but a humble Spirit knowing love that you've gave us eyes to see like the eagles up in the air and we see that little bit further in our brother and sister but Lord instead of talking bad about them instead of discussing them Father what we're going to do is we're going to pray for them Lord and we're going to share a bit of your testimony Lord and we're going to share of your word and we're going to take that brother that's so deep and dark in sin and Lord we're going to say Lord lift him up so he can sit with us in Heavenly places because it's only you Lord that can do it no man can judge Only God Can Lord but we are going to go there father and we're going to represent you with all we have you do the Greater Works in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen I'm
