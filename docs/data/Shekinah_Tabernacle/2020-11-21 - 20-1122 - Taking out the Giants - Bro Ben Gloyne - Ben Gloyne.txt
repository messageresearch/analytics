greet you all in the name of our lord and i say that jesus christ just want to sing this song for the glory of the lord amen um just sitting there on the chair and i realized that i'm very privileged i'm privileged to be called the son of god amen amen i'm privileged to for god who made the universe and everything to think about me of all the people to choose me so that is the privilege that i pray that is in your heart and you are realizing it this morning you know the power of the revelation of your privilege my privilege so it doesn't matter that doesn't matter what the devil can do doesn't matter to a point where paul says actually paul said what can separate us from the love of god nothing nothing what the devil does or does not do nothing can separate us from the love of god this morning so that's a great privilege because it doesn't matter what the devil does what matters is that he thought about you and me and the thought of life the thought of god is eternal hallelujah i want to sing this song um sister deborah i'm sorry miguel that someone dropped the ball and didn't want to come with me to help me um but if you can join him that would be wonderful there's a key that when i sing i break in the spirit and the devil attacks that key brother onions but there's a certain voice that when i use i break in the spirit and the devil has i think he picked it up and he attacks it so this morning i just want to tell him that he lost already life is easy when you are up in the mountains and you've got peace of mind like i've never known but when things change [Music] [Music] and the god of the mountain he still got in the valley when things go wrong he'll make them right and the god of the good times he's still got in the [Music] we talk of faith when we are up in the mountains but we come so easy when life is bad but down in the valley of trials in temptation oh that's when your face is [Music] [Music] [Music] and the god [Music] oh when things [Music] [Music] of the day [Music] is [Applause] amen thank you brother brother the onyas i'm so glad i saw your name this morning to deliver another beautiful item god bless you brother amen could have some volume

[Applause] what a glorious day i'll give a quick it's not a testimony it's just something that happened during the week waiting for the lift to go open and i want to get out of there get out of that wellington and that wild weather go home rest up and standing there with a with a guy with a colleague and uh he pressed the button to go to the ground floor i press the button to go to the first floor now the ground on the first in our building is the same and i get a different lift to him his lift goes open i go oh he's going to ground i'll just pop in there and he said oh you might have hit the wrong button i said yeah sometimes i hit the 11 i'm so anxious to get home and he said yeah or you could have hit 19. that was a bit random for me but i knew that there's no there's not 19 floors in our building and he said oh then you go straight up to heaven i go oh glorious that would be so nice and he was sort of shocked i think with the response he said you're not ready i said i am so ready and he laughed and that was that was the moment so hopefully that stuck to him um who would have no i don't know what he would have received from a from a worldly perspective you know if that was the uh that was the case um someone that's that's not a believer walking into the lift and you know be profane or something um is there any testimonies i just want to open open the door open the opportunity while we in this good times yes we've got a testimony yes mr melissa praise the lord i wanted to actually sing so i'll just say a testament i told the lord that i would do this if someone asked and we're starting right off with someone asking so oh okay um so about two weeks ago i moved please forgive me if i cry and it was a difficult space i've been in a difficult space for a while emotionally i've been like suffering with what we have now identified as depression and i started medication about three months ago and at camp i decided to stop my medication because i didn't want to be on it anymore i wanted to accept that i didn't need it and then two weeks later i moved but i think just stopping that medication straight was uh was a bit hard on my body and i my emotions were insane i had so many voices in my head and um i've physically have not been well either but just like every avenue that i could be attacked on i've been attacked on lately and um anyways i i i've got so much to say i'm sorry i i'll i hope that will come up here but um i got very very angry at my brothers and sisters well specifically my sisters because i had asked for help and no one was able to help me move that weekend and i was very in a lot of pain physically like my body was really really sore but the devil just puts everything in the perfect place to make you get angry for reasons that are actually not actually there like brother ben was saying another reality gets created so i was in this reality you know of feeling really angry and um i apologize i i left the brothers and sisters group and the sisters group because i was very angry and and i thought okay i can't actually pinpoint where my anger is or at who but i'm angry and that's just where i was and i thought i'm not going to rejoin because there's something in this and i just need to let the lord work through this and i've been in that space now since that happened and then this week um i i was busy driving i think it was tuesday wednesday and i started feeling that anger come again and i thought what i said why am i so angry what am i angry about so i thought and forgive me again but i started to think of each one of you and i thought if i'm angry with someone lord let me identify so i can go and speak to them and say i'm sorry i don't want feeling this way but i need to make it right you know i like with brother could be last week as well saying you know don't be angry with your brother or sister i was like but i'm angry but i don't know why and i don't know and who and anyways then um i kept saying i'm angry i'm angry and i was driving home from work and um i thought lord who so i started going through i saw each of your faces i was like going down a list you know like okay this was no it's just difference of opinion we're different people like i love that person the next person no but this i love that person like i could not find a single thing that i didn't love about every single one of you hey man and i thought well then what am i angry about omar all of a sudden i was like that's just freedom since you're not angry at your brothers and sisters you're sick and tired of the devil pushing you around right you're angry at him so stand up stop letting him push you around hey man and it was so good and i went and pulled the car over started singing this song which is the song i wanted to sing today and devil took my voice but i had a little jubilee all by myself in the car and it was so nice and sister junior i'm so sorry that i went off the group on your birthday there was not it had nothing but it's the boys you know like you get it had nothing to do with that it was my own reality that i was in and i apologize i wanted to do in a formal apology i do not want to just do say on the gribon sorry it was something that i was going through and i just needed the lord to take me through it and for encouragement we are all human we all make mistakes and we all have different cultures different perspectives that we bring to together yeah and we just need to always look because in every single one of us there's such beautiful a beautiful thing and that beautiful thing that connects us all with jesus and the love that we have for him and when you're angry place it in the right place and stomp the devil down and don't let him take control of your mind of your heart and let don't let him push you and pull you away from those that connect you and pull you closer to him and yeah that's destiny a there's a song that was playing in our house quite but uh this week is uh well according in my mind it was you can't cross the bloodline satan and it just hit me i just you get tired you get sick you get weary you don't sleep well and the devil will absolutely jump on that occasion sorry i don't want to preach i just satan you cannot cross it [Music] means finished in afrikaans let's let's just sing a few worship songs sorry is the anyone else he's got a testimony amen praise the lord god bless your sins i was not planning on giving a testimony but i wanted to so so the opportunity i held itself i might as well share with you it's just a very short testimony and you'll remember around june when i gave a testimony about my job and as a human being you sit there later you asking yourself did i live too early was the lord going to give opportunity for them to renew my contract because you know the benefits that you left you know what you're worth but then i just kept on saying but i prayed for this job and this is what god gave me so last week as i was working from spec save as i had gone to collect the classes then i met two of the guys that i used to work with in my previous job then yes we are greeting this i'm asking them where's everyone they say to me you know everyone is gone i'm like so i'm asking them about the one person who i know his contract was finished in october they said no he left also i'm like so what's happening with the project they said no nothing is happening in the project and i remember that my contract was supposed to be finishing last week so i was sitting there saying lord i just want to thank you because at this point in time i would have been sitting at home looking for a job but you saw everything and blended such a way that i get into a permanent position so that when the project stops i'm somewhere safe i just want to give glory and honor to the lord thank you [Applause] amen won't you stand with me or just sing a few songs can't you see why i'm happy and seeing it in a conviction of happiness you are happy that you've received this word amen can't you speak i'm happy i've accepted the revealed world [Music] [Applause] [Music] can you see why i am accepted [Music]

took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of uh jebus gilead uh which had stolen them from the streets of of of beth beshaan so where the philistines had hanged them when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa and he brought them up fence the the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son they gathered the bones of them that were hanged and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried a in the country of benjamin in in zela and the sepulcher of kish's father and they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was entreated for the land moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines and david wax faint and issue bush how do we say this help me someone this is interactive now someone say it who can pronounce it there we go thank you anyway he died that's the main thing he lost which was one of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spare weighed 300 shekels of brass and weight he being girded with a new sword thought to have slayed david but abhishe the son of zuria secured him secured him which is helped them and smote the philistine and killed him then the men of david swear unto him saying thou shall no more go out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of israel and it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the philistines at gob and um um that guy the hush yeah you know people always think why do you always pick the scriptures that you just can't pronounce you know this there's not a place for jokes but you know there's such a thing as being an educated idiot you know you can be at university for too long and you know anyway you know i can read really i'm sure i can who's who's happy today sorry forgive me which was one of the sons of the giant and there was again a battle in goblin sorry we'll go down to yeah with the philistines where allah al-hanan the son of uh jarrod gom the bethemite slew the brother of goliath the gideonite uh the spear of who uh the staff of whose spare was like a weaver's beam and there was yet a battling gath where was a man of great stature which had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born of the giant and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shemia the brother of david slew him these four were born to the giant and geth and fell by the hands hand of david and of the hand of his servants amen let's bow heeds in a word of prayer this morning lord jesus we thank you for your

bless our efforts lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning so i want to speak about taking out the giants this is why i quit listening to brother john you know it's been real nice um sometimes i get a thought late in the week but recently it's been i've i've been having a sunday on a monday so i'll be at work and and and this week's been a real week i've been literally the one one man band there's only three of us so you gotta you know i told my boss you know i'm gonna go join the circus and be a juggler they knew what i was meaning because i was trying to juggle everything but anyway the lord's good even in a busy situation and you know so i just started to write things down and have a good time so i had my sunday on a monday and anyway so you know we read here about a change in uh dispensation here where where the where a younger generation rises but i want you to notice that the beginning of this is when the past is buried now here we have saul now this is this is quite far into david's reign this is not when he first became king but you know there has to come a time where the failures of the past are buried in the right way where the discouragements the valleys the the the bits of your walk that you just really wish you could you never went there but you had to go there you're buried in the right way so what happened is with with um david i mean sorry jonathan and saul we know that they fell in the battle against the philistines and the philistines took them as trophies and hung their bodies up they cut their heads off put their bodies up in their cities and put um saul's armor in one of their temples and you know so but then what happened is some of the mighty men there of um of of a certain tribe and i think i have it here and once again forgive me for my slideshow uh and when the inhabitants of gabish gillie had heard of that which the philistines had done to saul which was find his body on the battlefield cut his head off take the bodies a trophy take the armor as a trophy all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of saul and of the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethshan and came to jebus and burnt them there and then they took their bones and buried them under a tree at jabbash and fasted seven days now so this is what so so they recovered the the bodies or they recovered the evidence of their failure and they buried it in a certain place now this word uh this place where they buried it it's uh it has a meaning which means dry so they buried it in a dry place they didn't bury it in a sepulchre they didn't handle the past the right way you know sometimes we can be faced with something and we just buried into our spirit and we don't deal with it you know that's that's like burying it in a dry place you know we need to bury the past in a place with his life where there's moisture where healing can come i mean redeeming you know redemption can come you know deliverance can come but if we buried in a dry place then that's when trouble can happen and we know after this so so many years later after david becomes king there was a drought in the land for three years and a part of that drought was because of this we don't want to walk in dry places sometimes we do but we're going to recognize that god is with us in the dry place israel was in the wilderness and it was a dry place but they had the very god that gave them life was walking with them they had the smitten rock right they had they had a source of water with them the whole time it means it's the same thing with us you know we're going to recognize hey we may be in a dry place but the water givers present i mean so so they had to come and they had to take the bones of saul so they had to take the failures of the past and and deal with it the right way so they took them they didn't just leave them under the tree in this dry place but they buried them where they should have been buried and that's why it says if we if we um jump back here and after that this is verse 14 into verse 14 and after that god was entreated for the land because they were praying lord how can this drought stop after this is all sorted this is why the past is so important failures of the past just deal with it right don't harbor any unforgiveness don't harbor any resentment any any guilt the lord took care of that you know brother brother john preached yesterday uh night about leaving the wound healing center you should go you should go watch it because you know he you know he basically said you can't live at a medical center that is not your final destination the purpose of the wound healing center is to leave the wound healing center that's why you go because you want to leave right i never want to say oh i'm going to go live at the doctor's place no the reason of going is to leave that place so once the lord's brought healing and restoration don't dwell there with your wounds walk on with god amen so so this is what they had to do they had to take the failures of the past they had to bury them in the right place then they could walk on but the thing is though once the past was dealt with then who who came on the scene the enemy came on the scene oh my so here we are in a in a time where where they've had a famine they've dealt with the failures of the past and we know that we've all had failures we've all had disappointments we've all had bits in our life maybe they're very long very big but to us they're all big right that we wish oh boy why do i have to go through that but you know there's a purpose for all these things amen so you know they had to leave the you know they had to deal with those things and then the philistines came on ward against them and now this is where a new generation arose david david nearly got killed by this one son of the giant and so a younger generation came and helped him and so there comes now now but we have to realize that the sons if they're sons of goliath they would have looked a bit like goliath they would have had glass kind of temperament right you can see yourself and your children amen you want to give them official letter of apology many times because of that but you know you see yourself and your children right so the characteristics that goliath had were in the children the sons so so it's it's amazing how the younger generation thinks that us oldies don't know what it's like to face the devils of today we'll face them we've faced those giants right and and we're going to come into the prophet's ministry in ours as well but you know we face those giants they may look a bit different but it's the same characteristics it's the same nature i mean trying to stop us you know live according to our god-given privilege hallelujah i mean so but it was the younger generation that wiped out the sons of the giant and so that's why it's so important we're all young but we've all got a place we've all got a position we've all got a sword to draw we've got an enemy to defeat because it's amazing at a giant in the land can can can stop the whole march of the people goliath goliath stopped israel for 40 days making his boasts they were stuck for 40 days he made his boast until one stood up and said i'll i'll take him i'll take this guy i've got a testimony hello you begin to testify and i'm gonna you know there's a giant in the land maybe it's just in my land don't testify about anything don't share testimony you know there was pressure on brother branham's day don't publish the testimonies of what god does there's pressure because the devil wants us to stay cold formal and powerless he doesn't want us to broadcast or publish the realities of what we believe and because the realities of what we believe go beyond doctrine but it's when that doctrine is manifested right because a testimony is the word manifested is it not hallelujah so those things the devil said no don't talk about those things so i'm here to talk about those things i mean because we're going to realize we have a living god we don't have a dead god we don't have a god that died in 1965. i mean those are brother brahms stories but what about your story hallelujah what about his testimony in your life those are the things that matter amen because we can we can gather around those things and say lord you live and if you live there you'll live there you know what david went against this goliath i mean son of the you know giant he said well i've killed one i'll kill this one but it was a season of a different generation to come to the forefront but the anointing that was upon david came upon them hallelujah and they killed every enemy that came against them amen and that must be the same thing with us we're going to take courage hallelujah we take courage the same holy ghost brother brahm says the same you know god the devil and both god they take their men they take their people but the spirit remains so the antichrist spirit in jesus day is the same antichrist spirit today but the same holy ghost back then is the same holy ghost today so the holy ghost that fell upon the believers then will do the same things today because it's the same holy ghost so we can look back in the scripture and say well god you did it back there i have the same holy ghost that they have because i believe the same word right so therefore you'll do the same things in my life as you did in their life hallelujah i mean so if it conquered there he'll conquer today i mean if he cast the devil out then he'll cast him out today if he brought deliverance then he'll bring it today healing today resurrection today hallelujah the same things amen so we can we can stand in confidence that we don't have to leave our we can bury our past and we can move on and you're glad scars mean victory we'll have scars hallelujah anyway go listen go listen to the whole convention whatever you do that's good hallelujah we were we were standing around was it that uh yesterday evening service standing around praying and the lord was there and i mean you hear the girls really pray harlow not just say a prayer prayer prayer hey darling it was awesome hallelujah just that there's such an atmosphere amen i love it how the lord you know i used to be this is me i used to be kind of skeptical about streaming services it's not the same as church and sure it's not but you can still have that same god visit you in your house it's not just you know now here is the sadducees which don't believe a real picture of churches today they don't believe in the supernatural they just couldn't believe it now remember remember there's a people today that don't believe in the holy spirit ruling and governing the church they don't believe in miracles they don't believe in science they don't believe in the supernatural they just don't believe it now that spirit is nothing new here it is right here on the sadducees you know why they're called sadducees they didn't believe in a that's what brother kevin grant you know you just said you know why they're called sadducees they didn't believe in a resurrection so they said you see but people can be so down even in the message you know and but the resurrection is not real to them amen but once it's real to you oh brother you just rejoice i mean they believe the same thing see spirits don't die people die spirits i mean spirits go on god took his spirit took his man elijah and a double portion of his spirit came upon elisha is that right then about 800 years later came on john the baptist is that right and comes right on down to the last day again hallelujah see spirits don't die people do but not spirit see the holy spirit it can't die it was on jesus now it's in his church always will be until he comes for his church because it's part of him amen i'm part of him see through persecutions they made fun of them back there in that day they still live here today god takes his man but not a spirit off the earth the devil takes his man but never the spirit out of the earth amen so we see that these things just continue on down through now brother branham wood would constantly fight against this all the way through his message from 1947 to 1965 he would use this phrase that people said the days of miracles has passed he was constantly combating a spirit that would come in amongst believers saying god don't do those things no more constantly fighting it amen who's who's ever heard him say that yes i mean so so this is just from 1965 but you can take it all the way through the message i just searched that that phrase the days of miracles was passed over 100 i think 101 times he said it and of course he said it in different ways but and if i'm talking to some men of god here when they try to tell you at the headquarters that the days of miracles has passed and this is what we're doing here and the lord jesus is blessing us and that's a bunch of fanatic fanaticism worked up worked up and emotion there is no such a thing as divine healing get out of that group right there brother and snax's finger snaps his finger get out of it because it's the word of god being made manifest they say there's no such a thing as a apostolic days there is no baptism of the holy ghost that's speaking in tongues there is nothing to it there so he's saying that he was constantly fighting the spirit that god isn't real anymore yes they had it back then but not today yes sure he did in the book of acts we'll acknowledge it back there but not now time has moved on people have changed no no people are still the same right we're still built the same way amen we have the same body spirit and soul god is absolutely still the same amen and if the same faith and the same word and the same god will produce the same results as it did in the past i mean she was constantly fighting i mean that there's days of people saying the days of miracles has passed but we know the days of miracles have not passed i mean our god is supernatural it's like if you if you jump into a body of water you will always get wet always right and it's the same thing if you go into the presence of god the supernatural is happening every time because he's a supernatural being i mean how could you make contact with a supernatural god and something supernatural not happen hallelujah so you know he was constantly fighting the days of miracles was passed and then after the prophet went off the scene many people would say do not testify of the supernatural of god because you take away from the prophets ministry actually no no to me that adds to the prophet's ministry because that's the proof what he said was true i mean because the proof of the pudding is actually you know what he said and what was demonstrated in his life is now demonstrated in the life of believers i mean we can't just you know other great moves of god like the lutherans they could look back at martin luther and say well god did things in his day but we don't but we don't see them today all wesley can say well we saw things in you know john wesley's ministry but today we don't have those things you know john wesley you know he he he preached an incredible amount of sermons traveled an incredible amount of miles on a horse preaching around and you know one day he was he was riding in his and his horse broke its leg he anointed it with oil prayed for it got it got back on it kept writing on amen things like that happened in his ministry amen but they'd say well those things don't happen no more they should happen i mean pentecost can point back you know there's a book written about the thee i don't have it but you know take the history of pentecost and bring it from the azusa street revival all the way into today brother brown maybe has like half a page in the whole book but historians said that his ministry spearheaded the post-world war ii healing revival history declared it not not believers history declared it amen but you can see where where it drifted from the azusa street mission and you know if you re you know who's ever looked into that revival it wasn't just a spontaneous thing for years los angeles was under expectation people were praying they were looking because god was preparing a people from mighty visitation amen and i'll say this if that was just for the gifts to be restored how much the coming of the lord how much more a bride now that well you know you know a bride that's going to walk from this world to the next you know we should be under a great expectation lord you can take us off the earth amen at any moment hallelujah but they had to you know they could say well that happened back there what about today amen and that's the same thing even in the message you know we know this message is not an intellectual revival the bride's revival is a revival of reality amen where everything they had in the past we have it now and we have a book open to break the cycle of revival and death that's why the mighty angel has descended because he says you're not going to go back into formalism anymore but you're going to stay in revival and the god of the book of acts is going to manifest himself in your life amen now brother brown when he when he you know he paralleled his ministry with the ministry of david it's important to see yourself in the scripture now i'm sorry if this is a bit small um he says and i and i want to get alone what i want to do uh what i want to do is to myself and pray because i believe uh that now is god by his grace has let me spearhead a revival that swept the world in the beginning see now i believe there's something coming that's going to be a double portion to the church and i feel that down in my heart now back yonder the last sermon i preached in my tabernacle was on david and goliath and i said here even my own baptist bishop stood there and said uh what did what did you eat that night he said you had a nightmare i said no sir i don't i don't appreciate that i said no it was the truth to me it was real he said you with your grammar school education is going to pray for kings and great men and statesmen and so forth and are going to be healed i said yes sir he said well how do you get that i said you better go back over at your tabernacle and forget about it i said how can i forget about it when it's wrote indelible by the blood of christ across my heart i said you'll see he said i'll be listening and you've seen the voice of healing here recently what uh what he apologized and he prayed for the sick himself now he said if i hadn't been so backslidden i would have listened to the boy and paid attention to what he said about visions you read what dr davis said all right now when god speaks anything though it linger it's got to come to pass now i believe that god is going to do it and there was that great modernistic day of science scientists and everything standing out there saying days of miracles has passed and so forth but god said go so he's so he's addressing there's a giant in the land i've got a sling of faith a slingshot of faith i'm gonna down this thing i mean that the church the living god can rally amen and the work can go forward i mean like david of old he couldn't slay all the philistines but he could but if uh but if he could only kill that boaster out there goliath and so when goliath was slain all israel took courage in a way they went and they beat the philistines plum back into their gates well now that's the way it's been now ministers has seen the vision and divine healing now even the presbyterian church in new york and all this practicing divine healing having healing services on wednesday night colleges are adopting it throughout the world in korea they had a divine healing service here not long ago and korea and thousands got healed down in japan everywhere from australia and around the world comes the news great news going through the books went forth ministers read taking courage and went out and divine healing has swept the world thank god so here he was he says yeah he preached on david and glass saying i'm going to go and take this giant's head off and he did hallelujah and that giant fell but now we're in another generation we're another generation where the sons of the vagina and the land i mean so now there must be a people on the earth that take courage and say well if he can do it the same anointing's upon me i can down that giant too hallelujah he may be a son of the giant but hey we're a son of god son and daughter of god hallelujah we're not a son of william branham amen we're a son of jesus christ amen we're born hallelujah so so here here's a time now i'm just laying a bit of a background for things but now when i preached my sermon before leaving this is him speaking about it again lifting him up out of history when i preached my sermon before leaving 11 years ago across this pulpit and mrs gertie sitting there saying that only believe in the great giant stood yonder like i preached on david and goliath there was science and great and the great known world to condemn divine healing and put it to shame and everyone telling me boy you you'll crack up out there they'll throw you in jail they'll do this that or the other but the god of history had come to the on the scene yonder and told me to do it and i did it by his grace and his mercy that same god that was history of ten years ago has raised on the scene again just as sure as he brought that to pass he shall bring this to pass he's the god of history and he's god of present day he never slumbers or sleeps he cannot die for he has no beginning or no end remember if god gives a promise god's obligated to fulfill the promise remember it wasn't brother brown that said i'm going to do it god said you're going to do it holy god was the one who did it right amen it's the same thing with us when god comes on the scene if god gives you a promise it's not your it's not you that has to make it happen if god gave the promise god gave the promise hallelujah so he can just rejoice don't get stressed about it if he said it's going to be it's going to be amen hallelujah now joshua would joshua would come to you know come come before jericho here and he would you know he had already been told by god as i was with moses so shall i be with thee but he was wondering how on earth was he going to take jericho it was impossible humanly they had no siege equipment they had no battering rams they had no ladders they had no siege towers they had no catapults they had nothing that could actually physically take that city so it's wondering how on earth was it going to be done but remember if god said as i was with moses so i'll be with you god's going to be the one who will take the city amen and god wanted to display his power to to joshua but also that younger generation that believed the message they didn't turn down what moses sent right they believed it they took god at his word and they came into the land now god wanted to prove himself to them it's the same thing with us we haven't turned this word down we haven't turned the lord jesus down we've entered into the land the son of man right we've entered in and now he wants to display his power to prove to us this word works and it's real and it's true and it's exactly what it means it does amen hallelujah hey if it said it will give you the holy ghost you get the holy ghost it says by your stripes you're healed you get healed you get delivered you get led hallelujah amen amen so now so then he comes out now i know you know all these things very well but you know he comes out and he sees a man he says and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho they lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword jordan in his hand and joshua went unto him and said are thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as the captain of the host of lord am i now come so he's saying he's not saying i'm for you or even against you i've come to take over your battle right i know you know i'm maybe i'm just getting old i'm just repeating myself but i want this i really want this dan corrin if he comes and takes over the battle remember it's not just it wasn't just for jericho like i said on wednesday but it's for the whole campaign so when god comes and comes down and you give your life to him and he meets you more than just a baptist way of giving your heart to the lord but he really changes your life what is he saying i've come to take over your walk i've come to take over your battles amen it's not that oh he's on my side am i on his side amen and he'll lead you in your campaign and it's not just for one battle well i'm sick it's not just a sickness it's not just trouble in the home or whatever it may be it's for your whole walk all the way into glory that's when that's what he says i've come to take over amen so for joshua's entire life the angel of the lord was present to lead him and lead the campaign hallelujah that's how important it is to have a personal visitation with god amen hallelujah so he says no i've come to take over the battle and joshua fell on his face amen and worshiped him he said what saith my lord unto his servant and the captor of the lord so said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou standest is holy and joshua did so so he took over the whole campaign battle see it was different see beforehand it would have just been humanly joshua thought i have this many men they have this kind of weapons how we're going to fight this kind of battle but now it was totally different now they had swords but they are anointed now their shields add shields but they are anointed shields i mean and it's like when god takes over our life sure we have a sword but when the sword becomes anointed and the mouth of the bride that's a very different kind of weapon amen it's a weapon that will cut off every devil's head it will cast them out it will bring healing he'll bring deliverance it'll bring the baptism of the holy ghost it'll bring creative power into the church amen because the sword is anointed remember they had to still be armed they still had you know they didn't just walk like a sunday school picnic you know girl was jericho be taken they had their swords they were sharpened they had their shields they had their helmets they were ready to fight right but when when the captain come to take over now their weapons were anointed now their shields were anointed hallelujah because they were actually promised you won't lose a man in this campaign that's why when when when they tried to take ai and yo yo there was a failure ai that's when joshua he didn't say well let's just get more men and try it again he said no something's wrong something's wrong you know there's sin in the camp this is why these people died not because we were fighting but because there's sin in the camp right and so he he called a halt he found out where it was they dealt with it then they just moved on and this is how we're going to be because they will promise you won't lose a man in this battle well there's the same thing why because their weapons were anointed hallelujah their armor was anointed you're the armor of god is the baptism of the holy ghost it's a supernatural armor it's not a natural arm it's a supernatural armor hallelujah amen we got the best we got the best gear in the world hallelujah man hypersonic missiles we got better nuclear bombs better hydrogen bombs better inter continental intercontinental ballistic missiles we've got better than that we've got the better better than anything they have all of the armies of the world better hallelujah hallelujah amen no weapon formed against us shall prosper hallelujah so now see the thing is well to me i believe joshua won the victory of the whole campaign when he met the captain that was when victory came the victory just had to be lived out after that moment because he met the lord the lord says this is how it's going to be i'll lead you in this campaign i've come to take over okay so if jesus is the general we're going to win hallelujah so to me the whole victory of the whole campaign was one right there sure they had to go fight they had to go fight battles and different things but they won the battle they won the victory who's following me remember when you when you meet the lord you won everything you've won hallelujah sure there's a lot of battles trials hardship pain discouragement whatever comes your way but you've still won remember it's not him that wins the war at himself i mean it's not him that wins the battle him that wins the war napoleon won a lot of battles but he lost the war and he died as an exile hitler won a lot of battles but he lost the war amen as they that was looking pretty bad for the allies but hey they won the war eventually it's the same thing you say well it's looking pretty bad so far uh it's not the end amen amen the word of god we know is a sword right amen amen people have used it as a weapon spirit-filled or not spirit-filled they've used it as a weapon right there's whole whole bible schools that use it as a weapon but it's just in the intellectual mind they've tried to yield it for two thousand years but it has nothing compared to when the word is anointed in the heart of the believer amen hallelujah now when he won the victory there the victory is just spread to others right what happened on the day of pentecost they won the victory god was dwelling in them they didn't just stay in the upper room and just have a have a whatever time no doors were open windows open they climbed out of there shouting and praising god acting like drunk people why because god's life is is to spread amen hallelujah so the victory that was won amen there spread to others now hallelujah now um this is how it should be you meet the lord you want everyone to meet the lord i remember when i met him at university i thought man everyone's going to believe this why because he became real to me it's more than ink on paper he's alive it's more than a voice on tape he's alive the words alive hallelujah amen it's like you know sorry sorry honeybee i'm going to share some testimonials from you as well but you know you know after after her sister melanie met the lord they began to pray for the church and you know in tauranga and they were praying that god would move because they knew that many people were going to church just because they had to and they knew that many people didn't know him in that church they were praying and they were praying and then they had a tongue and interpretation that god would come down and move in a powerful way and two weeks later it happened just that way there were young people in that service that said i don't even believe there's a god they said they're atheists but in that presence of god they were on their knees giving their lives to the lord i mean they knew that god was real so what happened they won the victory in prayer maybe took a while to pray through but when they pray through god said i'm going to move in a powerful way and he did and it should be the same thing even here amen when we have victories in prayer we should be under expectation god you move in this place amen because the same god back then is the same god here hallelujah that's how it should be amen we should have a burden for one for for each and every one of us refill them lord baptize them with your holy ghost doesn't matter how big or old young fat thin whatever you know baptize them refill them lord this is why we come to churches at night lord phil fill me up oh god empty me of the world and the trouble and fill me up with your goodness that i can walk out of this place victorious hallelujah amen that's exactly how it should be hallelujah you know god god visits us in many different ways you know i'll say this i'll swap to me soon you know before christy and i were ever courting or anything she had a dream with angel lord lifted her up showed her a panoramic of wellington to make her real show her this is where you're going to live that she'll be married to me that she would take me to where my job was for the first year she would drive me she'd be my taxi to and from work and we had children and we're witnessing the people that was before we were even courting or anything and i asked her the other day what's it like to be living a dream and she said and she said well it's you know you go to the place you like like when we first moved here and she said well it's like i've been here before yeah and this is what the word does he waves visions of ourselves before us as that as that song says so the word tries to show us this is really who you are and there's some there's like a familiarity about it that's me i know what that is hallelujah amen this is how it should be now back in this is this is back at our christchurch days this is well back in my christchurch days so i meet the lord my parents are living in papua new guinea i'm just going to share some testimonies maybe i just want to kill a giant in my life right maybe you're just going to kill the guy and move on so you know brother ed said we want testimonies today well i already had it planned not that we talk about these things you know what i love about this place it's incredible we don't see we never have a me okay sunday school children we never have a meeting teachers and me and say this week's theme is gonna be whatever and then we plan it no no the lord has the meeting with us individually you preach on this you teach on this you teach on this you talk about this driving here and talk about this with your children and then you walk in it's like how do they know what we've been talking about it's the same mind it's the same holy ghost hallelujah i mean we have a headquarters he sends whatsapps he sends emails and that's the holy ghost by the way it's not a physical man hallelujah we're gonna realize when you hear something it's not oh well this person talked to the pastor about it so he's preaching about it or this but dude i don't know this is not how this works hallelujah god's on our case he knows where we're at he knows what we go through you can't hide nothing from him and to me that's a good thing because we're gonna be stuck in alternative reality but god says i don't want you in that reality this is not your ordained place you're ordained places by me walking and victory but it's amazing you get stuck in things like we'll get to this but you know i used to be a real avid gamer i was into a lot of things but i was into gaming too you know but the thing is when the lord so after i met the lord and i was you know but i was still in games but i realized one day what am i doing now if someone told me god will live so much more in your life if you just throw them out i wouldn't really i wouldn't really have it in mind you know i wouldn't really accept it because are you just gonna get rid of things but why but once you actually get rid of the thing and god begins to live you know i would be i used to live in a house where none others were christians i was the only one i think they were just all atheists but i dedicated my room to the lord and my life first and foremost so whenever god would just come down i'd be washing dishes i'd be walking to uni i'd be and god would just come down and just speak to me and visit me and so whenever the prince of lord would come down i'd just go into my room i just worship him there so you can live in a place and the reason i'm saying this is you know it can be done but once i got rid of the games the lord was just so much more real in the in my life it was like a you know a pipe was unclogged i had met the lord before that god had changed my life filled filled my heart with his love and just you know the bible became a new book and it became personal to me but when those things just went it's like you know it's like some filters were taken off or something but the thing is i don't know how i wish i could describe going from having it to being free and then god walking see because remember god never leaves a void in our lives he doesn't say oh you've got to quit all this stuff and do this and he doesn't fill it with himself that's why god wants to fill our life with himself hallelujah then you ask the question well would you ever want to go back to that stuff no why would i trade him for a game why would i trade the reality of him hallelujah for that that's why i say you know get rid of the stuff but it's because god wants to fill our lives amen hallelujah 24 7. amen doesn't the psalm say he gives me songs in the night or i sing on my bed or you know hallelujah yeah we just rejoicing amen so amen so okay where was i okay here i am now you know so so i so i meet the lord and then so who was at the dedication meetings here with brother ron peterson that bro your gospel way we sister maggie was there we did you come down for that no this is the first church 2008 no okay anyway so i had this burden about that time because you know uni was going to wind up and i was going back to papua new guinea i thought how am i ever going to share this message with the people that don't speak english very well and i don't speak their language very good you know very good how and there's nothing in their language to give them how on earth am i going to share it and i was trying to work out in my mind while i take this book and this dvd and you know i was trying to work it out but then one day the lord just came down to my house and when he did that i just went into my room and it was such a powerful presence that i couldn't even stand i couldn't even pray i just forced on mine it was like a holy atmosphere more than a blessing more than a jumpy time such a powerful presence came down and the lord said not by power or by my might but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts he said basically you just go you show up and i'll do the rest and in my mind i've always been an accidental believer just kind of fall into things i don't plan these things you know my life's goals were not to pastor a church and be do mission work and what you know i don't know what my goals were at the time but they sure weren't even near the list but the law came down such a strong way and i've only ever had it like that that time and so i went there and you know my my parents housemate she was a she's a papua new guinean she was a christian ruth but she didn't speak english but she could understand english so so i could talk to her in english and and she would speak back to me in pidgin which is a couple of talk you know kind of like broken english but you know yourself we talked about him and i'm almost now you're happy you hear what they say and you're happy and um you know so so i was praying one morning i said lord how can i share this message with ruth because she was like the only one i knew and the lord said to me real simple show the deep calls to the deep show the prophet's ministry from scripture and tell her your testimony and she came into work that morning she came into work late she lived like on the on the property in a little house she came in late and i didn't know this at the time but but she was praying that morning all trouble saying lord i need to hear from you today god works both ends right so she comes in has a big smile on her face said ruth can i can i tell you my testimony and show you this and so he did and then and then and then she said after i explained the prophet's ministry from scripture she said can you write all these scriptures down so i can go read it in my bible now her bible wasn't an english bible it's a pigeon bible and so i i went online and and got attracted by i think brother rich searle you know explaining the prophet's ministry from scripture in english i printed off gave it to her she took that home and she came into work the next morning rejoicing she said you know she said normally english she can't read much of it but she said when she opened that book and started reading it she could understand every single word and the prince of god came down so strongly to the into her house she had to put it down go go outside rejoice and pick it up and read it again god goes beyond a language barrier sometimes we think how can i be a witness god is the witness god is the one that does the witnessing hallelujah and then we started having meetings just just in the in the factory compound so my dad used to run a a coconut oil milk copper mill and we lived basically there was the factory then there was a compound where our house was and we would just start having meetings in the house or outside their house or you know where the workers were living or in a village and but people would just come i didn't have to go find people people found me hallelujah how's it you know hallelujah and then so and then so it started from there and then now i was there and i remember when i was um so they have a patch of road and and christina this patch of road where it goes past one of the volcanoes and it's just it's just a dirt road now i've been four by fouring a lot papua new guinea is four by fouring all the time potholes have potholes have potholes have ravines you know kind of thing so you know anyway um so i was in the back of my parents uh jeep or eugene i was praying lord how can i how can i start copying this and getting it out i had some cassette tapes and i saw brother dennis kennedy just just in my mind like a vision or i don't know how to describe it but he was standing outside the old church of gospel way handing out cassette tapes then so i bought myself a cassette tape player and would record them real time and start distributing the message that way and then um i've got a purpose for for for sharing these things i want to kill a giant let's kill a john and then so i came back to new zealand and i had a few contacts people would just watch the deep author deep and rejoice and you know so i said well i can't afford to buy the book so i started printing the books and i burnt out a you know printer and different yo this is just what i did and i i didn't know what my flatmates saw to me i was i was flirting with christians by that time you know i witnessed to them and you know one of my friend of theirs you know i spoke to him about baptism he was so convicted that night he called one of my flatmates and got baptized hallelujah different things like that would happen you know but the thing is it all started with a burden and then god always meets a burden now to me when that happened and and i just i'm i'm slow you know it takes a while to catch on to things like christine you know the lord told her like a good year before yeah before he started courting that we were going to get married and she would pray and the lord would show us scriptures and speak to her as you know as he does and and then and then and then one day he you know shows her proverbs 18 22 if i have it right and she says lord it's all very fine telling me but what can you tell him and i think that's a real good way of doing things you can have a revelation that your children are coming in but well lord can't you tell them can you work on their end now you've worked on my and i'm in perfect peace i'm just rejoicing waiting for them waiting for them to come home but but can't you get on their case hallelujah so i used to i used to i'm sorry i don't anymore but i used to read a proverb every day brother blue kennedy um it was shared at his memorial service that that's what he used to do and so it was the i was going to see christine on the 18th and so i was reading proverbs 18 and i read it for over a year by this stage and i get down to verse 22 it says whosoever findeth the wife under the good thing and has obtained favor of the lord and the lord said christine's your wife the rest is history but the thing is she read that scripture the night before and the lord said see you're going to get married ben's going to be your husband answer but she's like lord can you show him so he took the same verse he took the same verse she had no idea i read proverbs he took the same verse and showed me from the same verse amen god works so so to me when he came down in that place in in christchurch god had this in mind didn't just have papua new guinea in mind he had this in mind hallelujah amen and you know so so we would start we would start going up there printing books setting them up and then we got invited to a little church up in the up in the sticks up there with no power or nothing and it's four by fouring just to get there and um you know that was where pastor emos was and the believers there and and that was the church that came into the message out of their denomination and i remember there's a brother now now this will mean a lot to me but it won't probably mean too much to you but you know there was an older brother there who um who his his wife owned the property that the church was on now for some reason over there you know uh landers passed through the through the woman instead of the men maybe because the men we used to get killed in battle all the time and the woman is still alive i don't know but anyway so he couldn't speak english but but he understood english and we were sitting outside the house and and we were talking about baptism and and and he he would say to me and you know pigeon you know him through it's true that's the right way to get baptized i need to get baptized he said about this message you know it's it is a true true word and as we're sitting there there's this eagle flying there's a puppet unity has an eagle uh i think it's the only time i've ever seen it it was flying up in the sky right above us i thought he's an eagle that's going to fly hallelujah answer anyway he was the one who got baptized hallelujah but you know he he passed on uh last year so to me now i'm expecting to see that's why i say this will mean a lot to me but probably not to you i'm expecting to see a young 18 to 21 tolai man step through the door and he'll say okay so when they say let's go that they say you me go we're gonna go so he's going to step through the door and say you may go now and the rapture's going to be on hallelujah hallelujah you know i love that song i know the master of the wind i know the maker of the rain whenever i'd go up there it would be monsoon season and literally the roads become rivers and it'd have to be because um what would happen is say say it was a tar sealed road but then after a couple of ranges be dirt would just pile up then they had to get graders through and like basically just just make a new road and so whenever the rain would begin to come and i knew i was either going into toteval or coming out i'd say lord can you just send the rain away because if it's raining you can't get in and if it's raining you can't get out if you're in 4x4 because because the you know and and it would start raining and then it would just leave hallelujah and then i came back home and i emailed um you know i came back to new zealand you know after those trips and you know you know i emailed my parents said you know how's the weather how's everything and she said you know you know the roads are just like rivers who's ever been in monsoon country it doesn't just rain it rains and it rains and it rains and it rains even you've been in that kind of stuff so i know the maker of the wind i know that hallelujah people are looking at me why are you saying these things i'm killing the giant there's power and testimony and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony hallelujah so there's great power in these things now that that house made ruth and i was thinking how am i going to say this so if sister biling top hears me say this this is not a bad thing of saying it but you know she was like sister beeling of papua new guinea she'd just talk and talk and talk nothing wrong with talking lots okay so but you know but then what would happen so so christy and i got married and we went up there for our honeymoon did a bit of a mission trip and stayed in the village and then we had a bit of holiday too had her own house there but you know when we when we met her there she was very quiet and withdrawn totally different person so what is wrong what is wrong with her and then she had this real bad limp and so we found out that she was carrying her outrigger canoe they would have these one-man kind of outrigger canoes they would take to the beach and they'd go fishing she was carrying it down the beach he fell over and dislocated her kneecap in such a way that the kneecap went up onto her leg and so she was taken to the hospital and they did x-rays and so on i didn't know this at the time but you know the tendons were snapped they had to operate but she said no no god's gonna heal me just just reset my kneecap and so they put the kneecap back but then she could barely bend her bent her leg um we actually have a video of that but i'll have to dig it out of some archive somewhere and um you know but then when we came and saw her she was very withdrawn didn't speak thought what is wrong and so we we we invited her to come come see us one night and we showed her the um so in my mind the lord's going to heal her leg and she's going to run out of that place but what happened was so so she came in we showed her brother gary walker's testimony who's seen that right and and we started talking to her about the reason this has happened is because you've received this word and the devil's not happy the devil gets mad when when a son or daughter of god begins to take their position and so we annoyed her her with oil and we prayed for her and she turned back to a happy talkative self hallelujah yep happy talking of self and then so and then what she said is that after she broke her leg or after she dislocated her kneecap and you know that happened she was laying in her in her house she said like a dark cloud came upon her and so as a spirit came upon her in her pain that's why you got to be careful when you get wounded by something that's when the devil because it's a weak spot the devil tries to get in but when we're telling her actually you're ordained for this word this is what you know you've received it yo this is you know there's a purpose for all this we prayed for you know that devil was cast out of her life but then she only but her leg was still the same but then i went back about a month or two later and she only had a slight limp and that's when she told us you know actually there were snap tendons in my leg that they had to be surgically reattached but she didn't but she didn't take the surgery now you know tendons are like springs if you snap them they go like this and they don't do this unless there's a surgeon whose name is jesus and does this hallelujah amen she had it she was looking after a little girl up there called channeler she was about three i think and she was this is one of the other times i was up there and she she was sick she had these big boils on her arm and she was very upset and you know we were up in total val we were you know having meetings up there and i said to ruth i said the reason this is happening is because because the devil doesn't want you here he wants you to take her to the hospital and stay there so he prayed for the little girl and i didn't realize at the time but she had malaria but after she was prayed for she didn't have malaria hallelujah and god and god touch your life and then i know i've stood here before and told you about the last uh last time we were up there where where my interpreter brother ronnie wasn't even a believer but he was invited to come to the meetings he was a he was a former pentecostal man and and he was interpreting for me you know because i was speaking english he was interpreting into into pidgin and and after the first service when i was closing in prayer he thought that i laid my hands upon his shoulders and and as i was praying there were hands on his shoulders and he asked me after the service did you put your hands on my shoulders when you were praying i said no i was i was praying like this and there's no one else on the platform there so to me it was the angel lord putting his hands on this man this word is for you and and i pray puts his hands on your shoulders today this message is for you this word is for you the resurrected lord jesus is for you hallelujah and then i begin to tell the people this message has returned us back to a true pentecost and he stopped translating for about three or four minutes because everyone stood up understood in their own language halloween they are so moved by these things amen why because we serve a god of reality we say you know he said well that's just the mission field what about here i said i want to actually give give give one more up there when i last went up there i started praying against the spirit of witchcraft because the people were being held back by something amen because because yeah a religious spirit is just it's just a rebellion it's a witchcraft so i started praying against those things amen and god and god began to break that power on the people and they begin to walk free amen hallelujah you say well that's just that's just the mission field it should happen in the mission field what about here see that's another giant that comes along oh the message has been here for a billion years so god doesn't need to prove himself anymore yeah he does i wasn't here in the 60s i wasn't here in the 70s i was here even in the 90s i turned up in 2007 i met the lord and he's the same god in 2020 you know you know another one you know you know my darling here she she got a revelation one day what if my husband is not even saved this is before i even turned up so she began to pray lord save my husband oh my god hallelujah hey man you got to realize hey what if he's not actually here or she's not actually here amen why should we limit god let's not amen take the limiter off whatever you do so hallelujah amen so we were um we were so on wednesday remember i was talking about angels visiting us amen now we we've had times we're in christchurch and we were laying in bed talking about the lord and it was like the pillar of fire was just a few foot above us it was such an atmosphere that i thought we're going to rapture right now and i said to christine it's like he's just right there you know we've had surfaces where it's just gone milky white well i've actually opened my eyes and and i've been looking for angels because the atmosphere it actually looks milky hallelujah how god lives remember it's his testimony we should testify you know our our fellowship shouldn't just be about the things we're facing it should be about the god that's living it's good to talk about because you're saying how i'm going through this it's good to tell because they can say i'll pray for you because we're we're in this together right hallelujah we're in this together amen so we're about times like that you know we're you know who was yeah there's a few heather in the september earthquake in christchurch yeah somewhere there we were we were there and and what i love is the lord will keep us doesn't matter if the world's shaking or not and so and so our experience of that earthquake was we were both in bed it was about 40 in the morning and where we were living down madras street was a quiet part of the city but before the earthquake struck was like a freight train was just literally going through our house there's no trains around there's no trucks or anything and then the and then the earth started shaking and it wasn't just a gentle roll it was like this and it wasn't just going this way it was going this way and so somehow so so the place we were renting was a was a single bedroom place and the and the bedroom was a mezzanine above the rest of the unit somehow we got down to the front door and that year i think the haiti earthquake happened and so i began to thank god because i heard testimonies of what god delivered people supernaturally from that earthquake where they should have died in buildings but they got out and different things happen and so i began to thank god that he looks after his children and the prince of god came down so strong you know some people yo yo we were sharing with some people they came over for dinner you know they said weren't you scared and i said no we had a great time we had such a great time oh no it was it was awesome you know the lord came down in such a powerful way we were just rejoicing christine was just praising the lord and tongues rejoicing and you know the world was shaking but we were in the best place to be hallelujah amen to the lord will look after us hallelujah hallelujah and then we came up here and god's been living up here hallelujah the first house we lived in there was literally a devil in that house it used to be a brothel we didn't know that we found that out that after we moved out the day we were moving out the neighbors said you know there was a woman who used to live in this house and and she used it as a brothel and there was a dark spirit in that place it wasn't just a like a shadow moving around there was a demon and we started fighting it would be like such an oppression feeling would would would come upon me when i would see the house come back to the house so we realized something's wrong here we should have peace in our homes it shouldn't be an atmosphere of battles and stress and oppression and it's not a prison home is not a prison it should be a palace it should be a city of refuge it should be a like a batch on the lake or a beach or something you can just go sit and relax and rejoice and you know so there's this demon in this place and we begin to pray and and the prince of god you know came down one one time we were praying and i felt this fear come on us and now that wasn't god but when the enemy comes like a flight i'll raise up a standard and so i felt this fear come upon me and and i rebuked it in the name of jesus christ don't always go by your feelings right and then i looked over at christine and she was looking at the door uh fro from from out of the lounge with like a shot look on her face and she could see the thing standing there and we cast out in the name of jesus christ and there's such a peace in that home after that hallelujah amen and we've seen healings we've seen god do mighty things you know our god lives but they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony amen you've been you better testify about the goodness of god amen and and the reality of him we've seen him heal we've seen the devil cast out i mean we've seen many things hallelujah i won't i won't continue in that vein but you know brother brown says this this is um wait what happened is it not there wait please hold technical difficulties but brother brown would relate a story of of when he was he was fishing with with the woods brothers and if you listen to the story the amount of things that brother ram said would happen before it happened is incredible and remember these are jehovah's witnesses some of them were actually saved but you know they were doubting about anything about you know this and it's wrong it's of the devil all this stuff but god would show them yeah brother rome said yeah we won't fish here because it'll be all muddy but we'll get to this place and you know he's specific about what he says about and it happened exactly that way you should go listen to it i think this is from believe uh there's a 1957 belief in the heart and so they're fishing now this is why i say fellowship's important you know some of well in my opinion i might be wrong but you know some of the best services that that that i've ever preached is because we've been talking about something and the lord comes down as we're talking and it just puts a thought in my heart we're just sitting around the coffee table at home talking you know you know what i love you know when you when you find the right one you never get sick of them you know you never think man i've spent too much time with her no no it's never that way it's so awesome i love it brother james is saying amen too you know it's just so nice you never ever get sick of your spouse you know friends sometimes hey you know we need some space but you know you know after a while but you know i hope everyone else understands what i mean if you need prayer afterwards we're here you know come but you know it's just so you know but you just begin to talk about the right kind of things and the lord drops down and begins to inspire amen guests begin to operate amen hallelujah so here they are they're fishing and that afternoon sitting back there brother would begin to speak about an old woman that used to belong to the anderson church of god up here when they were in their bloom how good said how she used to take them little jehovah's witness boys and love them and brother wood said to his brother lol he said lyle would it not be great now if we could go up and find that old sister and let her know that we're safe so they're just fishing they're talking about the lord and and and he just because this is now the desire of his heart i've met him she knew him i want i want her to know i've met him too hallelujah it's the same thing you meet him you want the world to meet him you know your friends or colleagues at work you think wouldn't it be nice if they just knew the lord or someone who knows the lord i want to go tell them about it yeah now that word found favor with god after being talking about god for a long time but that word found favor amen those two jehovah witness boys both him age men wanting to find out find an old woman and tell her that they were saved two brothers uh when they said that the spirit of god and his sovereignty fell on me that's what a gift is being operated now sitting there in that boat oh i wish i i could have voiced some way and i could sink that into the people's hearts i could no more control myself then you could fly to the moon just by that word i said boys there's something fixing to happen it's a little animal of some sort it'll be brought to life there's going to be life connected with it and you will see it right away and that did happen because those two one-state believers they didn't go back to jehovah's witness but you see what they were talking about that word found favor with god and god did the supernatural hallelujah so that's why i say how important is that they overcame him by the blood lamb and the word of their testimony where we can talk about the goodness of god and what he's done and god can say i enjoy that fellowship i'm going to step into that fellowship i'm going to i'm going to anoint the gift in their life that god is going to step on the scene and do something supernatural amen god will do more than just talking about things but god will come and do hallelujah glory amen this is you say well that was with the prophet isn't the bride gifted aren't there gifts in the body that just having fellowship can tap into god can actually activate that gift just because we're talking about the lord amen hallelujah because we can have things so caught up in our mind how things will happen and what's going to happen but then we can just we can just say a word and find favor it's like had he right you know she she just said to brother branham after after he explained the squirrels how did that happen and he and and she wasn't saying it because she didn't believe but she was interested i want to know about that i want details how'd this happen and she and and they were talking about what god was doing and then she said that's nothing but the truth brother branham and then god came down said ask what you will and it shall be done what she found favor with god hallelujah she didn't plan on finding favor with god she just said i believe that testimony how did it happen that's nothing but the truth hallelujah and you've got the salvation of your two boys amen hallelujah so now i say that's why the right kind of fellowship is important amen he said well we've got giants to kill i'm just going to leave it right there these giants are going gonna die they have an expiry date whatever you're facing in your life whatever you're going through i say we are a generation that have been risen up brother brown killed goliath he yo he he took care of that thing right but because people die but spurs don't die that same spirit has tried to come upon this generation to say the days of miracles have passed hallelujah that all you have to do is just be raised in church be a good person maybe you know definitely get baptized but meeting him is the thing amen he is a god of miracles he's a god of the supernatural now you don't have to compare you know i'm not trying to say you've got to have my testimony we all have an individual testimony but the outward but the finality of the testimony is that god lives and i love his word i love him and i love the brethren and i want to be more like him hallelujah but the thing is our god lives hallelujah and i'm convinced now remember this is just maybe i just got to kill some giants tonight sorry i used to sunday morning to deal with something in my own life but that same god that met me back in christchurch is very much the same god that's here today hallelujah and personally myself now this is not the end of the year and i'll probably repeat it at the end of the year 2020 has been the best year spiritually for me i found it good i had such a complex going into camp i shouldn't even go up the front shouldn't say anything i'll just get in the way no honestly but i had to do it i said lord i'm just going up there i had no joy you know but that but that well that saturday friday night at camp i went up you know people were called up for prayer i went up to get prayed for not to pray for people oh my god hallelujah and brother tears i i great i said can you pray for me you know and then and then the saturday evening i just went up there said lord here i come amen and the lord met me as i was walking up there i got my joy back i got yo because the devil the devil doesn't want we're all gifted people right we all have a gift amen we have a gift to bring heaven down upon the earth may not be to sing it may not be to play or preach but we have a gift in our life that god can come down hallelujah who brought who brought this fish back to life it was those two not the prophet those two caused that to happen talking about the lord they brought a resurrection of life because they were talking about the right thing they were just full of the goodness of god hallelujah and so we we all have a gift to bring them on the earth i believe it but the devil doesn't want us to live in that realm because in that realm he gets defeated he wants to keep us on a natural just a church level but we're not ordained to live in some kind of church level what's church level you keep church ordering that's it no that's that we have church order we must have church over don't stay there the this is the mechanics but we need the dynamics to come down into the mechanics right that's the main thing although that's the main thing is as the dynamics comes down supercharges our faith then whatever we have need of is manifested in our lives amen because remember we're a supernatural people not a natural people we're a supernatural people and we know a supernatural god that's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah so we've got to get out of our comfort zone see me i'm sure everyone knows me but you know me i'm very much i can shell up really easily withdrawal very easily this is you humanly now you know just just plod along i'm glad no one's saying amen christine's in the back room anyway you know but the thing is you can get stuck in a way of being but that's not the way god wants you to be god wants us remember his life comes into us that it will go to others virtue will flow healing virtue will flow deliverance will floor and that's and that's all of us remember we're here for one another every joint supplier to the body so i'm not here for me i'm here for you you're not here for you you're here for me we all need one another right but we need to say lord may it not just me be me carnally being a believer may you come anoint my life hallelujah that we can look back and say amen we've overcome by the blood lamb and word of our testimony hallelujah that he lives amen do you say well so that's me but you know that's like brother i think brother freddie or brother ferdi said yeah it's like our our first nature is not far behind us yes so we're going to be very aware of those things that's why we're going to die daily amen but we have overcoming power amen we have overcoming power you know i've been driving you know i drive half an hour one way to work every day i love my drive if i'm stuck in traffic praise a lot going to work coming home not so much i like to get home i love getting home but you know but the lord has said to me he said you know but you can have greater services than this you can have greater we can have greater we can have greater times in the lord now it may not manifest all the same way but we can have a greater time you know it's good we have our expectation but let's let's increase our expectation amen we can have a greater walk than what we have god can live more than what he has amen amen so i'm like lord amen remember because because if he wants us to have a greater time with him that's him saying i want you higher i want you to come where i am in a greater way i don't want you just to be there come up here come up higher hallelujah and the reason that he would say such things now this is just me is because he's greater to have amen it's not us trying to say well how can we manufacture that no we just got to give more brother brown gave the most complex well you know mysterious answer the most simple answer when he was asked how do these visions come he says i just yield i get myself out of the way and the more we can get ourselves out of the way the more god can operate so if you want to get out of the way 10 he'll work 10 20 20 he will give you he will work with whatever you give him so let's give 100. you know even not even in just these four walls but in our family life i give a hundred percent i give 100 to my children to my spouse 100 all that i am i don't live for myself i'm not here for me i'm here for everyone else that he would live because you know what i love about it when we gathered around the throne you know the testimony service will be it was all you lord you know christine has two favorite well she got a lot of favorite songs but one is you know when you reach down his hand for me when he reached down his hand for me and then her own well and then to me a part two of that song is that song she wrote it was all you lord you have brought me here all my triangle my striving couldn't do and that's what it'll be when we're gathered around the throne it won't be i did this and i achieved this would be no lord you did it in spite of me through my difficulties even with my humanity my hardship you lived hallelujah i mean can we have the musicians please i think i've always felt like should have quit a while ago the lord's good how god lives he said i don't know how to uh speak to people just tell
