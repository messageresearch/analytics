little bit of a testimonial service today say what has Jesus done for you this is our last service in this buling and what a privilege to have brother Kon and brother K and his family people that had such a big part to play in my life when God came and he unlocked a big piece of things that was broken in my life he used vessels to get my attention and the last service brother Ben says I would you want to take that service and it's in this church here in this building downstairs where I went on my knees at the altar and I made Jesus this is just a building God dwells in his people and he was so mindful that he brought the people that touched my life in such a place that I couldn't walk the same again battles was real oh they were real when God gets you attention and he sets you in a way the battles are real but he is mindful Hallelujah and he said I'll never leave you nor forsake the I'm going to go with you right in that battle I'll be in you and with you till the day that I come back yeah he's not going to leave us here Church you just need to touch him he already knows you're coming you just don't know it yet Hallelujah so we'll have a couple of testimonies but I just first want to welcome our family from tanaki and know when they roll in it's like you're home if I go into Teran I'm home go to Oakland we're home there's just such a spirit of God dwelling among his people today you always feel welcome so I hope you feel welcome enjoy the service God has made something real special today for me wow um we've got Sister Barbara you've asked for pray for your sister she's gone to hospital and she's there in Zimbabwe um can't read now put too many tears in my eyes um what's your sister's name sister Lizzy and she's going to go for operation soon on Monday we just want to pray for her healing that God would just restore her fully um we've got our pastor that's not here today he's there with brother Isaac what a service if you've ever seen God come on the scene for a man you know I I just get astonished by Brother Isaac someday when he just come and he he opens him up so much he leaves himself so vulnerable just to give God the glory and I thought devil you didn't win God got the glory in every situation no no matter how dark it was our lord Jesus got the glory on that day he cannot be defeated brother Colin he cannot Hallelujah so we're going to pray for her we're going to pray for brother Isaac we're going to pray for the service this afternoon he's put it on the WhatsApp as well he said please pray for me um he really wants to to let God have honor on this day so let us pray for that let us just bow our heads if you do have a need bring it before the Lord raise your hand say Lord I've got a need cuz he sees that need and he's already answered it we're just too slow we're not in time our gracious Heavenly Father I've got both my hands up because Lord I need you Lord I just need you to take over the service may you get the glory Lord may it be for your kingdom Lord for winning souls to Christ Lord Jesus Lord you see we've got our sister dear Sister Barbara Lord sister Lizzie is now there she's having to have an operation I don't know what's wrong with her father you know Lord and I just want to bring her before your throne Lord and I want to say Lord we just come and pray and intercede on her behalf Lord and say Lord may your perfect will be done in our life Lord Lord may she have a recovery Lord in such a place Lord that she knows that you've touched her Lord Lord and and may it just be such a testimony giving you glory Lord going rejoicing everywhere she goes Lord telling about our lord Jesus that is mighty and Powerful Lord and I've overcome every situation Lord and healer Lord and the deliverer Lord Lord May that testimony rain and you see this afternoon we've got our brother Isaac and brother Ben Lord there's many opportunities Lord the Harvest is great oh Lord but the laborers are are few Lord I pray that that you'll just soften the heart of the Lee family there Lord and I I pray that you would just give them a time where they maybe look at their life Lord and see where they go and maybe Lord have a word and season for all of them because like brother Isaac said they're wonderful people and they they love Lord they they just don't know you so I pray would you please pass their way and Lord may they just touch you today Lord and may they also not be the same pray that you'll take this service Lord and may you just be glorified in our M Lord anoint speaker and hearer Lord For the Glory of your kingdom in Jesus Christ Our Lord and savior's name amen amen you all can have your seats thank you musicians usually I let the musicians sit and you all stand for some reason I don't know why do that such emotional service I'm so so sorry I couldn't keep it together I was sitting there at the back and it's all J's fault he started picking the songs and then Sister Barbara was entering in and I just thought you know what a mighty God we serve that that no matter where we are he's there with us and uh so I'm going to share a little bit of of a couple of photos with you but first what I want to do is I think because we're not didn't go into the service we we'll go into the service officially so we'll maybe just make a time for testimonies and um if you feel led to say something this is your time but before we do it if we all can just stand up I just want to open the word today and so we all do it in the presence of Our Lord um because I think it's right let's go to the Book of Joshua and we go to Joshua 1 now this is not my service there my sermon um but it is part of it so this was not my opening scripture but I thought I'll just put it in there and we're going to start there from verse number three oh actually we can we can yeah let's start from verse number two uh chapter one Joshua chapter 1 and for you Bible scholars there's no first Joshua second Joshua there just Joshua yeah he didn't have to do it once twice he did it once and he just done it so it says there every place that the soul of thy foot shall tread upon I have given unto you as I said unto Moses every place that thy soul of thy foot shall tread upon that I have given unto you as I said unto Moses for the Wilderness um this Lebanon even unto the great Riv River the river e frates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee um let's just pray Lord Jesus as we open the Service we're going to share some testimonies Lord but there's no point opening this Bible Lord and not inviting you here Lord you only can reveal this Bible to us Lord and reveal the heart of God Lord in our situation I just pray Lord that you'll just take the scripture May the blessing be upon your word Lord and may it fall on prepared ground in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen so now I want to get the official stuff out first so I've got the black mic now you can make it easy on me today is you can come and share a little bit because it's our last service what the Lord maybe has done for you in this place called shikina you cannot go longer than half an hour and you cannot be shorter than 1 minute but if you feel late this is your time where you can give God the glory for what he has done in your life here and if you go even through battles testifies what he's going to do in your life from here on um because I'll share mine but I thought I'll share mine after you have shared all yours cuz mine's got pictures and then I'm cheating you know you know so uh so if anybody wants to feel lad to to come and share a bit of your testimony now is the time brother Colin he's first out the gate please God bless you brother Goin morning brothers and sisters um just really so thankful um yeah it's been one year now yeah so one year praise the Lord and uh yeah so and I just um so thankful because every time I question the Lord is this the right place go just look at the

my life and it's been in this building where I first got stopped me from my tracks um I turned my back on the Lord about 15 and it was a rough road and just seeing how the Lord's brought my life back together and restored what the korm stole and ate from my life and what sin did to me and how the Lord reversed Every curse and broke every addiction and every Spirit off my life is just it's amazing I was in a real broken place when I came these ways and the Lord has just restored everything and I'm so grateful um yeah I'm looking forward to the SE season moving on to a new church and a new building and seeing what the Lord's going to dojah glory to [Applause] God sister Robin we want a brother there man first time I meet him man we always had a punch up me him he I'll tell you that later no punch-ups here you wouldn't buy my puzzle had to many pieces missing [Laughter] mate I remember that I just want to praise the Lord that song that Josh um chose for us today about the woman who reached out and touched Jesus all she wanted to do was touch Jesus all my life I wanted to have that relationship with him I came out of a denominational Church nothing wrong with that church but it was not right for this age and I just praise the Lord that I'm here but I know that this journey is not ended it keeps on going you know we just have to keep on reaching out to the Lord and saying every day even in illness even in Trials Lord just touch me today can I touch your garment can I just hang on and just keep on walking with you and I just want for everybody here when they're going through a rut just to look up not to look in but to look up you're looking you go down that Wormhole like brother Ben says but you look up and then you say oh yes that's where it is that's where I want to be Lord just take me there you know and I just pray that for everyone today thank [Applause] you we got sister ly coming brother mesach was too slow out of his seat listen if this goes on all day I don't mind this is where God puts on flesh I just want to let you know these moments are the real moments amen she's czy hasn't even got the mic yet yeah I don't know how much I'm going to be able to actually say but downstairs is where everything started for us as well we've never heard the message before we came here and when we met all of you the Lord changed us the Lord changed our Mar the Lord restored and I'm so thankful and just I've been wanting to say thank you to all of you because this last this last year was probably one of the hardest ones for us as a family and what we've been going through and was dad passing but what I every single time I got discouraged the Lord sent one of youah with other there a food parts or a encouragement or something and you are the you are God you know and I think for mom as well what she realized and what she saw in all of you to high out of the lips of my heart I want to say thank you for the life that you're living I thank you for the testimony because every single time you guys just the Lord used you and you listened and I want to say thank you for being open and listening may the Lord Jesus bless you guys richly I'm excited for what's lying ahead with the new where we going and what's what's going on and there's has been an amazing season here but I know there's so much more coming so God bless you [Applause] all the am on on on God bless you Saints issues are here right we came over last year and uh our desire was if you come to New Zealand we need a church because we we are from Nairobi church so we tried to look around we saw different churches wanganui was always coming first so when we finally decided that we coming to Wellington so we searched we saw shakina so the first Sunday we were very tired we could not make it then the second one we came in and we were saying we just go and see we are not sure if we stay because we we are looking for a real Church where we can feed from his table but uh when we came in we did not have any doubt from there on end forth this became our church amen we really thank God the first year was very difficult for us looking for jobs and all everything in happens when you move to a new country but through the prayers we we always came in and we got the prayers and all our needs were answered we really thank God for all the Believers this it has been really a wonderful place I really last Sunday Joan was telling me when we were going out you mean we are not going to come back here next Sunday will be our last Sunday I told him yes then he said no I love this place what do you mean now we not be coming here on Sundays so it has been really wonderful for all everyone including the young ones and we thank God for it God bless [Applause] you there we go I say don't make me call you up here right God bless you um Shalom Saints um if I don't speak the rocks are going to speak and um I'm not going to allow the stones and rocks to praise and um speak about the greatness of God while I can be able to speak it's almost two years for us we came here I think on the 28th of October so we sort of couple of days from our second year anniversary I met sister Priscilla in South Africa no I haven't met her in South Africa she was given a name and she loved the name before seeing the face she made sure that I don't know how that I'm catered For that's why I'm saying I met her in South Africa magically in New Zealand Sister Christine already I'm in South Africa I don't know her I don't even want to know her because my thinking when I leave was that when I get there I'll meet everybody I got sister Priscilla's number while in South Africa from her friend called sister Tanya and I'm like I'm not going to call her up until I get there so let me get there then all the arrangements will be done but she's like I'm not having any of that Tanya give me her number before I know it um I get a call from Sister Christine like oh my God what has she done um before I know it I know of sister Lani in Oakland that I have never even met before I know it I know Sister Tei I'm talking to Sister Tei she's giving me encouragement she has never even seen me because we had issues of the Visas and all those things she's talking to me like she has seen me I come here I have a car I come here I've got a place to stay I come here I've got furnisher a house fully furnished I've got plates I've got fridges everything that you can think of um and I think I have said Thank you sometime last year but I don't think I did Justice to it I'm going to do it again and say the God that we serve is unlimited um when you are in the message you think that you have reached it I am here in Shak I know that I haven't reached it I came to this service and service after service is you can make it you are stronger than what you think you are that has been the the message for me through out all the services this is the service where somehow I believe that Pastor Ben is outside my house all the time listening to our conversations seeing everything that is happening in my house because something happens on Monday I come on Sunday and brother Ben is standing here and talking about exactly the same thing and I'm like this man somehow is if dropping on us it's impossible that he can know what is going on beyond that it is the love from each and every sister there are times where I feel like I'm falling and I just have sisters that I carry me there's one in particular I don't want to mention her name she treats me like a child sometimes when she talks to me she talks to me like I'm a young child but she's got so much respect for me that I also don't understand it's like a paradox how can you speak to me in such a manner but you treat me in such a manner as well and it's the love the respect everything that comes from each and every one of you in the kitchen the fellowship where we fellowshipping over food it's something that is new to some of us we come from various churches in the mes as well the love is just there because the prophet taught us it's about love more than anything and that's what you will get in every every message church that you go to not that we are perfect but that is what you will get but we come here Sunday in Sunday out we come here we eat we Fellowship we get to know sister how was your week and when you can get how was your week that's how you are able to pray specifically because you know how my weak was you don't pray generally that I'm just praying for the sister you are praying specifically to my challenges because I would have told you how my week was and I just also want to encourage that let's talk about our weeks because it's through those conversations that we can fight the battles that are targeted we can know specifically what it is that we are praying for I want to thank um the pastor Sister Christine to thank the deons it's not an easy job sometimes it looks like it's easy we we know that we are very very difficult brother Kuan brother Ed but everything that you are doing you are doing with all smile all the time no matter how much we are troubling you you never come and complain about us and for that we just want to say thank you to the brothers and sister sisters shakina is you shakina is in you everything that we want out of this service is in us and we are luy because we've got a pastor or a leadership that allows us to express ourselves everything that we want to see in our service this is the place to be in I'm just so grateful so thankful that I'm here my family too just wanted to say thank you to each one of you [Music] [Applause] amen I bro it's your turn come come Nana family came in here at the the time where we really needed them they were Heaven s our brother Ed J now God bless brothers and sisters um I didn't intend to to stand and uh I don't know what what the Lord put in brother arman's heart to call me but uh like sister ping says you know if I cannot speak or Praise Him the rocks will he'll make a donkey too to see the angel so my one cannot be finished in one uh testimony but I just want to thank God for pleasing me throughout my life at a specific place and at a specific time he placed specific people that will play and very a very impactful influence in my life uh you know it's it's a bit different when you are still young because you cannot really look much back to see you can only learn from others learn from reading the Bible how others went through but when you get to where I am at the moment I'm 48 and this year I attend 48 but I just look back in my life from when I was small and uh I'm I'm just shocked because God knew every moment I didn't know he knew every step he knew all my weaknesses he knew my the pitfalls which I will fall in he knew everything and he also knew how he's going to deliver me so I just want to thank him because you know we come we come from a country that is very or used to be a hostile probably still is as we know every country has got his own Spirit allocated demons and chief demons so our country beloved mother South Africa has got also so I grew up hating a white man I grew up like that and uh so because I I I couldn't faom how can you want to treat another human being the way you treat and I I didn't like that so when the go El started to be preached to me that was like now two extreme sides that frustrates me let's preach this gospel in line with hating these [Laughter] people combined with growing up and the challenges of growing up and being a teenager then that led me into a wrong direction fast forward University life was better because I was away from home who parents who say this and this and very legalistic background and all that so University was a first eye opener for me my first experience of the Holy Spirit at University but I still had you know demons can hibernate and hide you don't overcome they they realize you want to raise your head they hide and they they gather the power and wait for another opportune moment the Lord exposes them so what happened I eventually the Lord knew that that demon you didn't overcome it so the Lord made things in my preparation for the marriage that my wife could not travel then we had to had to have a wedding Minister advised and and and officiated by the white Pastor so at any point in my life I can without any Shadow without any fear of contra addtion yeah that the Lord placed me at any specific time in any specific place and he placed the right people for that and that's what I want to thank God for and he did the same he the Lord repeats the Lord does not change he repeats if you fail a question paper for the Lord he doesn't change it he brings the same one you see the Lord is not like a very unfair examiner who tricks you no he brings the same question paper until till you pass it and he'll make a provision for you to pass it that's what he did for me the Lord repeated himself throughout my life looking back and then shakina was was was cream Shaka was scam one of the outstanding sermons that I always tell sit down with brother Ben just to chew it again was breaking the the generational cases it was a series and I landed here with my family in the middle of that series man man I never had you know God has got gifts and I I can't praise a man but God has got gifts that comes and and reveal certain things in your life and exposes you to the sunshine yeah so that's what I thank God for today and I just want to give him all glory and all honor and I cannot if I go on brother brother Ben said there's no preaching just give you a testimony so but may God really bless you let's take this battle forward and not not we are almost there we are almost there I love each and every one of you continue I'm in a season now in my life Armand where I'm raising children at an age where I never raised children to be 18 22 I never did that kind of a thing it's a new experience for me and God said no no you don't have to have experience to raise them I am with you amen so I really thank God and I appreciate my children because sometimes I'm hard and the Lord said am I hard to you the Lord asked me am I hard to you that's right I said Lord change me again so I want to give God all the glory and I'm so proud and privileged to call each and every girl in this church my daughter BL it's coming he knew I was going to call him next day and I look at the other Deacon too if you get the deacons on your side you sort them I told brother gben he needs to come with me and we stand here together so a lot of things happen for me in my life here in chak Tabernacle no it's not the end like we said so it's now exciting we're moving we're making space for those last souls to come in so we're excited and we still we still hungering and thirsting for righteousness for everyone I was lost and I was found and I'm here so there must be someone out there I was the worst of the worst and if it can do it for me it can do it for him or her and that's why we and that's why we're moving that's why we're moving we need to press on um a couple of things the best song leader ever I cannot change my testimony I've said this many a times so when my testimony changes something is is not right my testimony cannot change so best song leader is sitting there at the back brother kin he stepped into a gap he sang with with all he had all the keys he had and and it was wonderful that made that M that started to change in me that started to go Lord so now I'm speaking to the Lord and I'm seeing this this warehouse and buckets standing everywhere and water dripping and moldy and the brother Ben was crooked and all that you know that's my that's when I walked in I go is this it is this it and I had to leave all that behind right we came in and and we wanted to run we were running for for a few months still and um we came in the bottom of where we standing now at the bottom and we grew up we went up another level spiritually as well and here we are and uh and and and we're growing out out the seams now so many things has happened the positive will override the negative always we've seen the growth we've seen our brother our children you know I don't want to spoil I can see the slides what's coming there's a few few really good ones in terms of we saw our children grow grow in stature grow maturity physically growing it's awesome it's awesome and and and brother Colin if it's by the fruits you know when when when we are not here on a Sunday on a Wednesday we're at home and it's It's Tricky it's you know the devil it's he's there your old nature is just you know just the shadow behind you that's when we see the fruits there's a there's a there's a change in the in the children's hearts and I go oo wow cannot be me it cannot be me so yes we've had hardships yes we've had people coming in here whole families best friends walking out and the Lord asked me so where are you standing this is it I've prepared this ground now for you you make that stand you make that call as for me and my household and that was my call had to can't live under a shadow can't live in someone's else else's Shadow we what what's what's happening and that was real for me I said Lord where would I go like the disciples said here I'm getting fed I'm looking at the fruit I'm just we're just still growing and the fruit trees is hanging it's harvesting time baptisms is happening and you see the individual going down in the water and you see this this deity of God coming out that change that that that just the washing of the word I go I cannot go anywhere you know so and and yes brother you guys came right after that W when when I was on my lowest of of my low and uh your children walked in they beat you he to church yeah they were here was it was it was it all the um New Year's Eve so I greeted them in suu I said they said I couldn't believe who's who's this who's this and U so that and they sang for us that wonderful brother Isaac was was flawed he he was just astounded and um that's what we remember brother Matt and sister Priscilla the myms walked in on our when we were low when we were where are we going Lord I cannot run this and do this and there and sing and have a mic and be in the back and all Lord what do we do and he comes in and he just does all his algorithms and all his AIS and he just makes it work look at this man he's just wonderful so uh but it's the gift it's the gift and you talk to him it's just so calm it's just so you know and I had to learn that cuz I get tense I get stressed you'll see me I go into Camp mode I'm running around you know it's just all meticulous you know and I'm learning from all these all these Elders you know it's wonderful to see so I can carry on but that's that sh kind of Tabernacle we are so excited where we going CU now we need to get creative again our Solutions mode we need to fix we need to provide what are we going to do we want to have a church service so praise the Lord amen [Applause] I think pin will take too long hey like um God bless you I just want to make a continuation from what brother Ed said it's interesting how God plans everything in ahead for you because we just came in after everything has been laid out there's a sing this everything is done here there's a pastor there's you know this just but for me I've been a Believer I've been raised in the message all my life but I want to say coming here it made me step a notch higher spiritually and I thank God that you said what you said everything was laid out but that was what we see in the in the physical but there's also what I came and I saw in the spiritual and for me that's what really touches me about this church it's not the building cuz we living here so it's Shak is not this this building Shak is you and what I received spiritually and how I've grown spiritually from just fellowshipping with all of you I cannot I cannot put words glory is to the Lord and on top of that this is my hair I have to say I have to say that this is my hair I look at the mirror every day I know I have given a testimony God delivered me from something we call trania and I've been wondering should I come and say should I but I just said yeah if if I don't say rock will speak for me I'm not going to allow that because this is a battle I've fought since I was around 9 years old and for as long as I remember this section of my head up to around here uh this section and at the back was as you can see here it's not because it's pulling itself out or it's not growing it's because I'm pulling it my hair out man is a disorder where you pull your your hair out I started having that uh disorder when I was around 9 or 10 years old and and I something bad had happened to me and um it's when we came to New Zealand that God really kind of just give me a flashback spiritually of what really happened and how those demons just came in and took anchor and all my life until then I kept asking God how do I pray God heal this person you heal them how do I pray God help me with this and you give me you've you've given I can count and run out of what you I have prayed and you have answered but you just don't answer this which is right on my head and all my life nobody has ever really seen as apart from my husband and maybe my family that really seen me with my with my natural hair cuz I've always done wigs and weaves and just to cover my hair and I've always when I wear them I got to a point where the devil was telling telling me that um uh you'll just you just live like that for the rest of your life maybe God will deliver you when you go to heaven but I'm like so what's the point of Deliverance if if you cannot deliver this and then more I hear that then I I put on the message and the prophet says you're here you're here and I'm like go those are two two different Spirits talking and I'm not going to listen to this other one I want my Deliverance so this is a testimony that I can put my hair my com and com a hair at the front and I have all this this is a testimony that I've I've dreamed all my life as long as I knew I had hair on my head so I'm just grateful that when we came here we found a spiritual Landing not saying that there are no battles but it's through the fights and it's through the victories that I've learned and I've grown spiritually in a way that I cannot say I did uh when we were back home so I'm just grateful for all of you sometimes I might look like I'm just in my own world and I disappear and they come back but I'm forever grateful for Shak and like my husband said when we came we just we just felt at peace I think that's the word we just felt at peace when he walked in and we saw brother kuin and he just smiled and you know the way he does and he was just so at peace when we left and we were driving back to the hotel we were like that's the church that's the church J was like I'm not going to any other church that's the church but it's not the church it's not the building it's the people so we are grateful for that and I just want to add that when one door is closing it means there's another door opening and I believe and I pray that we have our own not not rental God bless [Applause] you the war truck I wasn't going to wait for you to call me okay I was sitting there and I was thinking should I should I should I should I and yeah um so we all stand here today giving a testimony but there's no testimony without a test and um I I came into the message um a major test it was not something that um that anyone would want but um I believe that the the foot footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord and even though it was through major heartache that I sought the Lord I believe that that was meant for me to appreciate what he was going to do in my life later on and going through that is it's not a nice thing um but okay I can't stand you all day giving a whole testimony because it's way it's it's too much but um you know I always ask the Lord why you know losing a baby is the hardest thing a mother can ever do but when Ben and Mark had um little Gabriel I went on my knees so many days praying for them and praying for that little baby because I could enter in knowing what it was like going through the trauma of having the baby and Market being in hospital and the baby born and the first pictures and things like that I said to the Lord so many times I said to the Lord we've lost a baby please please let them have that it's just the hardest thing and it would be something that will be their anchor and I'm thankful that the lord gave them little Gabriel because he's such a blessing he's I call I call him a little Smiley baby because every time you look at him and every time you call his name he smiles so for that Journey I'm thankful I'm I have a such a thank heart to the Lord for our little Gabriel but that's just one little testimony you know I've also learned through the years you know we've we've been serving the lord for 22 years now Never Say Never okay you knew that was coming um you know we we were in New Zealand just just a couple of years and we came we came down to Wellington and um we stayed at sister Kay's little um Cottage and you know Matt said to me oh we should move down to Wellington and I said to him I will never move to Alon oh de and um here we are and um you know when when the Lord put it on on Matt's heart for us to move down here you know up until that point you know um every season every Pastor that we had you know we were grateful for the journey um but I just want to thank the Lord for our journey you know it's been four years since we've been down here in Wellington now in June of this year was four years we've been here um and I believe that every every step that you have in every it's every season the Lord takes you through certain things um I'm just thankful for the ministry that brother B has he's an amazing Pastor he's an also amazing person he's got an absolute Heart of Gold and for his people he is so selfless and I'm not lifting the the man up I'm just lifting the the Lord in the man you know and what he's done for us here looking at everyone listening to everyone's testimony you know he's done and touched every sing single life that's sitting here and had an impact um on everyone's life um for me personally I have grown so much under his ministry I've found peace and rest and I'm happy the journey hasn't been easy the walk hasn't been without his trials but sister ping you hit it right on the we have to talk about it as a family as a church family we pray for each other constantly we support each other through everything we talk about it and that's how we can go on from day to day and week to week um I feel exactly the same sometimes I feel like adant or Isaac or brother Ben also standing outside our window listening to our conversations you know last week um brother Isaac brought his message across and you know afterwards Tiana said to me you know that's we were driving to taranaki and we were talking about stuff and that's ex everything that he said was exactly what we were talking about how does he know those kind of things but the Lord does amen and when when those confirmations come through it's actually just to secure and anchor your walk and your faith and that's what I believe um I'm excited for the new Journey um it's it's different if anybody knows me they know that I really struggle with change um I'm very grounded and very rooted and so if someone when when Christine said to me you know and I was like okay you know cuz I just don't do well with change but um I have peace about this I know that the Lord taking us through this journey because as a church family we all have the desire that we want to have our own church at at some point so we all work together to achieve that um one last thing Christine thank you thank you for your many nights and days of sacrifices the things that you do unconditionally for every single person here whether they you know from duckies age all the way up through you just never ever moan or complain you're always there for everyone and we thank you for that it does not go unnoticed and we dearly love you and Ben I just want to thank every single one of you as well for for welcoming us into the family you know when we walked in here the first time brother caben said to said to me welcome home and that meant so much to me and then we walked into the kitchen and AD man said welcome home and we knew then we were home and we thank you for [Applause] that I got your tiity brother K we got a traffic jam here I'll put a light on keep testifying there's your tissue get a race up here um I just want to say God bless you all um it's been an amazing journey um a quick testimony from myself is obviously we have shifted down to Wellington um the the journey or or the the kicker was um to well i' say we've got this Camp not the camp before the camp before that um but before that camp we well person Al I has um got into a bit of a a uh everything was ticking over type scenario nothing was wrong nothing was really that right and I got lazy and I started um just just leaving things un unsettled un um I'm just sort of put it um there was okay looking back there was three things in my life that were affecting me but push them aside I didn't go fix it I didn't go out there and and actually organize these things in in a way that was best for the Lord and myself and my family and they they crept in and they started causing me to um I I guess get into the rut of daily living I was I was going to church I was going to work I was just just living but not on fire for God and um and and it just and continued in this way and that that camp um I'd say three 3 years ago um down here in wton was an amazing time an absolutely amazing time um the the the atmosphere the people and everything and and I and I switched and I was like oh man now now I'm I'm on fire like things are right with me now like we're we're good and it took a week of coming home that those three things got shut back in my face not fixed not fixed not fixed and I'm like no no no no we we're fixed like these things are fine like like like how and why what's what's what's changed and I sort of took took stock of that I'm like how is that not sorted um and I and I started praying and and looking in I'm like okay okay what's wrong I was like I know I'm good now like I'm I'm not in a in a bad space I'm good I'm good with the Lord with we're good so why are these things not fixed when I'm sure they were and started looking into that and thinking okay right maybe maybe I'm right I'm good with the Lord but I'm not where I'm supposed to be and from there it was uh okay well if if God blesses me then I will I will start putting out feelers and see if that is right if I'm I'm good with the Lord but I'm not where I'm supposed to to be so from there um I've always had a a heart for the church down here um always tried to help out and almost almost had a toe in the door at times I feel so that was the first sort of inclan okay try Wellington and we had tried in the past um many years ago I think you guys were downstairs or even at the first church to to move down this way and it didn't work out so okay fine fine um so I tried again and the initial response was and I tried work was was the initial thing so if I need to move I need to be able to support my family so I'll see if there's a job down here um initially the the people I tried sort of came back with no not not really going to work and then it was a week later they rang up and said yes please come and I was like okay cool that's the first inkling and we organized everything we moved and it hasn't been an easy easy Road it took us over a year to sell the house in Teran so mother-in-law okay is obviously here but she put up with us for a year living in her house which as anyone knows when you're living in someone else's space with your own family it's it's difficult um and I say things with with work and and the struggles there with the change of how I had to move things but looking back God has blessed the road it hasn't been oh we've come down here and everything's gone switched back straight we're good um my life is perfect no no no there's still struggles there's still character building there's still testimonies but I know I've done the right thing because of as Colin said the fruits and it took about half a year with yourself and and now you're coming my eldest two kids have been baptized and it's and it's just you see it through the fruits so I just say thank you Lord and um God bless you [Music] all it's good to have you on the base let's make two more testimonies so so sister and then brother kben cuz then we can get into the service man and my service is like 2 hours long hey I'm I'm joking God bless you brothers and sisters and first let me introduce myself I don't know if uh all of you knows me I am Marian um um I've been in the message for a decade back in the Philippines I'm from Philippines and my my um father-in-law is a pastor and and then when when we're um when we're coming here um my father-in-law asked me um Marian you should uh find a message end time Message Church um in here in New Zealand because um um as uh as we known um we don't we don't um need other churches or other Christian churches um because I know that there is so many Christians churches but the end time message church is the only church that we've been and then I had a we had a brother from Oakland um he introduced me to Pastor Ben and then he messaged me on Facebook and then Pastor Ben uh introduced me that um he has he's a pastor here at Shina tacle and he um he invited me to be here here at his church and then one one day um someone messaged me also his Isaac Lee he messaged me about um uh he told me that his um here in this church and then he offered me a job it's it's been a month that we're here in New Zealand he offered me a job and then it's a good thing that um that Lord um he always had a plan for everything and then I didn't know that he's from here from the church here I just know I just I just realized that why he's offering me a job like he we don't know each other he just messaged me and hi um just I just want you to um to go here at the Pizza Factory and I offer you job or something and then we had a conversation and then he just uh he just told me that um he's from church we had a conversation and then he just told me that he's from church and then looking forward um he I got a job from The Pizza Factory and and then um we decided to and then okay sorry for that I'm not really good in English I'm sorry okay and then the problem is we don't have a car because we we are just um living here for a month and then we don't have a car and then also and also God really had a plan and then Shannon messaged me he they offered have to have a ride going here at the church it's the first time that we're we're being here they offered they offered us a ride going here they um they used two cars one of their family and then us uh I bring my three children going here and I almost I almost cried that day because um that's the first time that I've been here um I've I am really happy that we found a church we just not found a church we found found the home of home of the Lord that I meet the bride and all the brides of the Lord and then okay another story sorry and then I had a job before a fulltime and I also work at the Pizza Factory I I need to I need to give up my other work because it's not healthy for me I had some uh I had some um let me say injuries about my shoulders and then I only had a part-time job at the fixa factory I only work for um 3 to four hours a day and then that's why I'm working part-time we had a struggles with our expenses with our rent with our food and then there's um it's been two months that we've been struggling I only had uh because we're also and because we're also um um supporting our family in our in our country and we are five in the family um we've we've been really in struggling and then I always pray to God that Lord please provide I know I know you are the provider and then um even if I have had only $50 for our food this that was really enough for us I know this is a small amount but if you surrender to the Lord that he will provide yes and he will provide and then I always pray to God that Lord please give me a full-time job we really need it and then ISAC Isaac um is he I'm I'm always been grateful that I met this family the Lee family Shannon Isaac and he talked to me and Marian you will you will have you will be full-time here in two weeks and that was an answered prayer um sorry brother and sisters because the reason why I'm in off and on and off in this church because we don't have a budget for the petrol that we've been here and I also grateful to Naomi because she gave me a ride today and sometimes just because um I always longing that I will be in this church because because um um having um uh if we're not here we're just um

in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ every testimony that was shared today um you know there's so much more that we could say what I'd like to say this morning is I'm grateful to be part of this body of Christ I'm grateful to be in your families and you in mine uh as brother and Pa shared a bit you know we come from South Africa we got a few South Africans here um we came with no family we just came with the bags in our hand but the Lord knew where he wanted us he knew where he wanted to place us he he knew what our lives were and he knew how to work with it to change it so I can stand here and tell you that I'm a true Testament of God because I was not going to church my wife will testify my mother-in-law sitting here she'll testify um I had as brother said a toe in the door uh yes I'm coming no I'm not coming yes I'm coming no I'm not coming uh that was my life when we lived in South Africa um I was out in the world I did everything under the sun we won't want to go there uh it was a dark place I had no education besides school and my wife with [Music] her strength with her encouragement that she has from the Lord with with the dedication that she had towards doing the right things and and and looking up and looking at the Lord and getting direction from him we are here in New Zealand I would have been left back in South Africa with nothing right and it's because of my wife with her education we've come to New Zealand the Lord opening the doors for her to make it work for our family to grow um sister Shannon if she was here she'll laugh at me um Vanessa will sit with or sleep with the One earb Ear Pod in her ear and she'll put the other one in mine um I couldn't hear the message I couldn't hear the prophet speaking it was noise to me it was just like no no no I don't want to hear this it's so old it's so monotonous but it wasn't my time the Lord knew my time when I'm in my 40s yeah I'm standing here now in my 50s but when I'm in my 40s the Lord got me by my ear and he brought me in and he says look look at what you have I had nothing I thought I had everything I had absolutely nothing the Lord provided every need for me finances the job the roof over my head the car we drive my wife's at home looking after my children he put me together with a family that I never had we talk about black and white hold on where we come from how can I hug brother Armand how can I I welcome my brother Ed these are Africana Brothers they won't talk to me no but they look me in the eye and we talk to each other not uh I think oh brother kuin I'm not sure no no no in the eye they look at me and tell me hey brother I need your help or I can go to them and tell them I need your help can you support me yeah we would have never had that in South Africa but he brought us here and then when we come here we look at wow every color every race every tongue where you from sister is from Germany sister from Canada from Kenya South Africa oh everywhere you can think about and then Sister Christine a Swiss background who would have thought I will we be able to talk maybe she's talking a different language I can't hear I don't know he sister margi they put us here we met brother Colin look at him the Lord has done so much in his 70s what for us in his 70s the Lord can call the brother I want to say thank you to the Lord for everything that he done for us this is just only one part he's just giving you a touch here is telling us now it's time to grow spread your wings giving us a bigger place move out from this we're thankful for the landlord here Neil uh as my brother said we had a place at Mountain Buggy leaking roof buckets all over small in number big in heart yeah that's only because of the Lord small in number big in heart when my pastor called me to to song Lead that day uh it was my pastor with a buang knee my sister who was unwell on the keyboard uh I think Brother Andy and brother Isaac was out on a job so there was no guitar player and my brother walks in the Deacon he walks in who knew he'll be a deacon then yeah that's right yeah but look at him now there's a gift in each one of you whether it's a gift of serving whether it's a gift of picking up the papers whether it's a gift of setting the chair as young boys you'll do a fantastic job in this body of Christ there's not one that can say I did it it takes all of us here so we can stand and testify all you want but it's each one of you my sister touched on Deliverance without this message I've been to lots of churches visiting and going along I got delivered here in shakina it means so much to us my children are not here each one of them came through but they are not here today but that's a testimony that's for another day the Lord knows and in his time struggles will come struggles will go trials will come and trials will go but we just need to focus on him not look at the small things in front of us the love that you all have I haven't seen it anywhere else only in this message I can see the True Love come out I can go as the brother said go to Oakland go to Christ Church go to taraki go anywhere the love that each brother that has for each other you know you can feel welcomed you can feel loved can feel supported I'll be able to sit and talk have a meal with the brother or the sister and and it's and it's fine it's not I'm more better than you or lower than you no each one respects each other each one's supportive of each other you know we we if we if we did it any other way if we did it for the praise of men we won't be standing here today if we did it for me myself and I no i' be standing outside downstairs not in this door I just want to thank all of you all for the love and the support um for standing by our pastor my pastor is not here today um greetings from my pastor greetings from the Elder that's not here as well brother Isaac um these men these men the Lord has used them in a mighty way Wellington was a dry place for a very very long time now I'm talking about over 20 years and when the Lord sent my pastor to Willington um I said no can't be there's no no Pastor going to come to Wellington it's it's it's it's broken it's it's it's finished these brothers never left me they never left me go they checked on me they supported me they asked me questions they sat with me we fellowshipped we ate together but they never pushed me they were there I I I could call them at any time but I was too proud to call them I was too hard to call them and on witness day I came here for prayer wednessday evening if anyone was here you would have seen me standing here for prayer because I don't want to have that proud spirit I don't want to have the complications that man wants to give you or the devil wants to throw your away I don't want to have those things hindering my walk so I came to ask for forgiveness if I've had a proud Spirit if I've got a proud Spirit uh sometime you like as the sister and the brother said you know was he standing outside listening to the conversation was our pastor there I don't talk to my pastor for weeks sometime I talk to him for things that are important I don't trouble with my pastor otherwise if I need something and he needs something we talk but otherwise no my job my job his job is his job you know if I can fix it if I can help if I can support if I can uplift if I can do something then yeah I'll take it I might talk to the Deacon but we leave the pastor out and the pastor does his part and if he then he comes to me or the deacon both ways that's each one of you here maybe we're not talking to each other daily I don't talk to you I don't talk brother Maran when last I spoke to you did I phone you no brother mariam's got his job he look after the young men and woman going wherever doing some music uh band practice and all that kind of thing I don't each one's got their job so please continue fighting the good fight

you're okay check yourself I get reminded my wife reminds me yeah my wife reminds me you know I can just do something you get reminded and the reminder is not coming from my wife the reminder is

some ups and downs like that but the word of God is so sweet I what encourage you guys can never face so we just keep figh on even though the journey is not easy as you know that everyone pray for each other and standing for each others so we never give up and keep going and praise the Lord all the time no matter what you are going through the circumstance sometimes is not easy but we because the Lord already win the you know this battles for us so give all the glory to you and glory to the Lord thank you God bless you all than walk a mile in someone's shoes and you'll kind of understand what they're talking about I don't think testimonies could ever do it justice what God has done for us all he Amen Let us just stand I'll quickly go through a bit of a slideshow but I want to open up I think I'll just go to the service I might skip my slideshow there brother it and I'll just go to the service um we're going to go there to Joshua and we're going to go to Joshua 4 please we'll just start that oh de let's try this again um maybe next time when I have a chance maybe go back just a couple of can I go back is just driving let just see go back a couple of slides just before Joshua 4 this is what it's all about this is what what we lab before is to birth Souls into the kingdom of God to give them a chance to meet the great God that we have met this is what we what we here for there many a more but these are the golden moments I went through all my memories of this church every brother that meant something to me I've got I've got so many I could say but I I we've we've got gone over the time but this is G in flesh because every one of you young persons have to have a chance to meet him every one of you older persons brother Colin must have a chance to meet him that's why we here that's why brother Ben stands behind this Pulpit day in day out Sunday preaching giving his heart burdens because he wants to see people birthed into the kingdom of God amen so let us just go here Joshua 4 and we're going to read here the 12 memorial stones we'll start the at verse number eight and the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded and took up the 12 Stones Out of the midst of the Jordan as the Lord spake unto Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel and They carried them over unto the uh um is unto the place where they lodged and they laid them down and Joshua set up the 12 Stones in the mid of the Jordan in the place with the feet of the priest which bear the Ark of the Covenant stood and they are they unto this day amen may the Lord just bless his word you may be seated so you're a written epistle read and known of all men and they they look at you but before you can have a testimony like they said all of you preached my sermon so I don't I'm just going to go over it a little softly but I want to Anchor in something today I'm not a I don't have a Teaching Ministry as such I'm not a very good teacher I'm more like you know just a soldier just March and do it but there's something that the Lord placed on my heart and I thought sometimes we just have to take one step back to basics because we we want this highflying moments and we want Miracles and days of Miracles and seeing s uh people birthed into the kingdom of God but we we forget the basics of the whole thing there's a certain way God wants you to come and and it's he knows you're coming he selected you predestinated before the foundation of the world and so he's already chosen you you're you want you're there but he wants you still to come a certain way so what's the point of sending us a prophet in this end age if we can just do and make and say and please what we want to where's the what's the point of brother brandom coming and preaching this message living a life having to go through all of that and we just glaze over these things so you children this is for you I've put as many pictures as I can in here possibly and I want to I want to drop something in here and which we see the memorial stones if we go one back brother it is that driving oh back here okay sorry we had a technical glitch don't worry it's not our first rodeo there we go so we look at these memorial stones and basically what happens is Joshua came to the River Jordan and God gave him which we read in the in Joshua 1 he said you go over the river you take the land it's your promised land so God's telling him to come over the river God's giving the instruction to go over the river but what happens is Joshua has to still do it don't get me wrong we always see Moses cross the river with the Red Sea we always see Joshua going through and there's wonderful Miracles but remember he's standing in front of this big body of water and it's daunting and I says I don't know how it's going to happen but God wants me to go through here and so when he takes these 12 Stones he takes it and he builds a memorial and he says I want to remind you that God did this in this place right here and he laid those stones at the foundation there where the Ark of the Covenant was standing right there in the river and he laid them there at their feet because he wanted to know there's a place which going to tie you back where your journey started so it brings us to justification so children justification is very simple Abraham had a promise God said I will deliver my people with a mighty hand they're going to sojourn in a land but I'm going to come I God is going to deliver my people he didn't say Moses was going to do it he said I'm going to do it how he's going to do it Joshua didn't know Moses didn't know yet but he said I am going to do it for 400 years and also that Nation who served them will I judge because our God when he fights for you he fights for everything all your battles all your hurts all your troubles all your doubts all your frustration all the things that's daunting to you God will fight it for you we need to show up but to know that there was a promise for the Israelites so the Israelites find themselves here in Pharaoh's U Palace and they just mud doublers they just busy busy with their everyday life and uh they got used to being there and there was three stages of their Journey you know so if you think about justification there's three stages of your journey with God okay for we justified by faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ forsaking the land of Egypt so we know we have to come out of this land of Egypt because the promise said you're not part of this world your the promise of God says you're you're part of a world to come you know we don't seek a kingdom here on Earth we seek a kingdom up there in heaven amen you know and that Kingdom will come down and will reign in the Millennium there's a promise for you but we found ourselves in this place in Egypt we find ourselves on the cyber world we find ourselves in YouTube channels and all these type of things we find ourselves in Hollywood Fame and Fortune we find ourselves come to a place when we were birthed that is riddled with sin Superstars and super cars and all these wonderful things out there don't lose me now kids I'm about to close this is for you you fall asleep on me I'll call you out right now this is for you not for you out the the we we're all grown-ups we know what I'm talking about because you're fighting the same battles but children I've spent till 1:00 this morning get this pictures up for you this is for you okay it was hard the thoughts easy the pictures are the hardest cuz they're so filthy out there on that world you can't Google Apple and you can't run into something that's just absolutely out of the pit of Hell so please watch the pictures and listen to brother Arman I won't be long if you do fall asleep do jumping jacks I encourage you but just say praise the Lord hallelujah while you do it okay just wake yourself up you need to stand up sit down I don't mind this is just listen we had testimonies of this wonderful place okay just be yourself if you need to stand up a bit and stretch your legs do it we won't we won't think anything bad of you but just follow me through this one this is very important so you are in this place you were Bor born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to this lies um world speaking lies this is the state that you are in you can't change it no matter how much you want to change that state you cannot change it that's your natural birth it sucks you're in Egypt but the only place that you know how to come out of Egypt is there has to be a call upon your heart and there must be a Divine reflection to say hey there must be more than this and that's the Lord Jesus Christ and the preacher is preaching and Camp is going on because we're preparing for camp and he's and he's delivering the word and he's telling you a lesson there's more for you listen the world is shiny but I've got more for you I've got a place where you can have happiness all the time I have a place where you can have peace all the time look a trial is a trial you can be in the biggest battle you ever fought and you can still be happy I'm a witness to it who who who's seen it you look at your bank account in the end of the month you go oh Lord Brother Ben how are you're going to do it but you get more excited because you know he's going to do it you just don't know how because you're standing at that River and that River looks really daunting and you go God I don't know how we going to cross this thing I don't know how I'm going to overcome this sin I'm not know how am I going to drown depression how am I going to do this I don't know I'm here at the river and he says all I want you to do is cross over but put me first so he goes to them and he goes and he meets Moses and he says to Moses I want you to deliver my people and he goes to brother Ben and he says brother Ben I've got a message for Sunday I want you to deliver my people but see the people wasn't ready to receive from Moses yet because they were looking for God but they didn't see God in the man so respecting the offers that's behind the pulpit respecting the gifts in the body is very crucial because that's God sending a man to deliver you now he told them all he saw a burning bush he went to the Egyptians man this would be the coolest thing you've ever seen a brother I come there to you and I walk in I go hey brother I saw a bush that was burning and it wasn't consumed it was on fire it was I could feel the heat I've had it all it was so big that I had it got me noticed cuz I was just doing the Sheep you know for my dad and father-in-law and and it got my attention and when I got there it says take off your shoes and he's bringing this message to Egypt but Egypt's not ready for him here you are in church young people old people the message is here you can be taken all your sins as paid for already but the messenger comes and he says do you want to give it up so can you repeat the can you believe the report of The Messer or is it too unbelievable we had testimony after testimony in this place in these four walls we God delivered people from sin and from darkness and from drugs and from alcohol and partying and all those things and he sends a messenger not just the message of the hour but even your pastor and saying you could have that if you want to let it go amen but see to be purely Justified you have to accept the word of the Prophet or else you're still just a mut dobler you're living under your privilege you ain't free from that sin no matter how many people said we buried that thing H sister we buried that thing and all of a sudden the H it shows its head again why cuz you still haven't accepted your way you're still living under your privilege you're still a Slave and yes we need to fight but hold on justification says you never done it in the first place the blood of Jesus Christ Struck it off you've never done it God looks at you it's never been done amen so as much as the devil wants to come you you still have sin you go nah I don't have sin God took it away but you need to come the right way there's a provided way for God so children don't miss this now here we go this is all God's people but they lost in a little world they're not lost in the word they lost in the world now they sit and they have drink parties all your friends that goes to school jonno Reuben Mo all the other guys what's the topic of this this this this here drinking girls party vaping they're living at up but they don't know that they are totally separated from God and if their life should end right there on that day they will come before the great Throne of judgment and they will be judged according to the way they lived it's just what it is now I'm not scaring you that's the state of the world but we that's been Justified Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ forsaking the land of Egypt come out of her and brother brandom comes and he I've got a little bit of of um uh I'll go we going to it now just hold on so because it's nice building a career it's nice having fun you know you go to youth groups and I'm going to share a little bit of my heart cuz guess what I can CU brother Ben will fix it all up hopefully next time we meet you go to youth groups but you go for the fun you're in the wrong Spirit you go to youth groups and you go for what you can get out of it for yourself you're in the wrong Spirit you go to church and all you want to do here in church is speech FK to the guy next to you you're in the wrong Spirit you know the thing is you cannot justify my sin if somebody else's sin is greater then that justifies me sinning don't look at justification like that we're all individuals in front of God so the world is having fun they're online gaming they've got Facebook Twitter all those other stuff they're so busy and they so much in contact with the world they forget about Christ and they're falling to sleep they spend hours till 12:00 2:00 in the morning partying and having fun and fellowshipping in the name of Jesus Christ and the next day brother Ben is trying to share a message and all they do is sleep in church why if life is here and it's freely available for you to help you in the times when you need it why are you wasting time like that if you came prepared brother Ben doesn't have to prepare at all have you ever thought about it if you're so under the anointing of God if you're so prepared to come here to church and say today I'm having my blessing and last night when you went on your knees before you slept say Lord just touch me tomorrow am if all of us was in that atmosphere brother Ben doesn't have to open his word nothing he has to just come say here Lord Jesus take over and he will take over he doesn't have to study no scriptures he doesn't have to come and try to get a thought the thought will be already there because you have a hunger you have a need but but unfortunately because we have a need we're filling it with these things but you actually need him you actually just need him you can still do all these things don't get me wrong no drinking hold on that was cool drink by the way I'm sure um you can still have fun we have the most we had Marion's birthday yesterday most awesome time I had at my house we were playing touch rugby and Ben was getting all excited and he I beat him that's all I wanted to say there was only one try sorry intercept right down the corner we had fun we were jumping trampoline we were just visiting we had the Bri master here we had the best food we had Fellowship we were all sitting there just having an awesome time clean beautiful awesome time so you can have it but don't have it all the time and then when you come here you don't give God the first fruits that's right so this is just for us it's just to encourage you when you come here be a zealous as when you're there at a party be as zealous here and you will not leave you hungry you will not leave your malnutritious you will not leave you boring and bored out of your mind you will actually enjoy it the only thing is you're not in the right place but you want God to be in the right place it don't work like that God always comes where he's invited but you must prepare for war amen he says Where in the past times you were according to the course of the world according to the prince of the power of the air that worketh in the children of disobedient this is how we came but then said one day in this church there we had M he gave me brother Ben as a brother Ed as a deacon and brother Ben as a as a friend the pastor now see God sense a humor you know the the worst sinner you could think of possibly God goes don't worry armont I know you lie and you take chances I'm going to give you a really good friend he'll be a deacon and then your other good friend he'll be the pastor and they're going to shape you and those two men in my life that times played such a significant role because they were the balance to my unbalanced life so you have that brotherr in church that just rubs you the wrong way God put him there say thank you because that brother is not rubbing you hey James because he doesn't like you the brother's rubbing you because you're a pearl of Great Value but you need to be rubbed a bit and don't worry as much as I rub James James rubs back on me and the more I think man James annoys me I think he's preparing me for Ruben and Liam cuz they're coming cuz they're going to be his age so now I know when James comes and he looks like he wants to wrestle me I'll start running cuz I cannot take him anymore he's too strong he's just not faster than me yet cuz I get Ruben Liam to tackle him on the way out so we know we're done so so the question is you as a child if you haven't accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior you are still living in sin because the sin question hasn't been settled you you haven't surrendered your life to Christ yet so you're still part of the world that's fine hold on you have a chance there's always a chance but when you say I accept the Lord Jesus Christ you must accept it with all of you you can't just accept him on your terms and conditions you know uh uh I'll I'll cut maybe deep with this one you can't say and I don't mean it that way remember my heart is cuz I love all you I share my life I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ but I still wanted to play cricket I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ and cricket's not wrong I've bring the balance but I wanted to drink still I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ I was sitting in brother Andy's house and I said man I love smoking because I wasn't clean yet the desire of those things was still in me so mentally I just accepted them but I I've not given a full surrender but it came so don't worry if you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ and you don't really kind understand why things don't work out all of a sudden and you're having battles and you can't get this depression and all those things gone you you can't get it gone hold on let's move on Amen cuz God don't just go Bing you're a Believer you're going to have Heaven Rapture let's go you're good fully mature awesome Elder in the church don't work that way God knows how to deal with you because he made you and he created you so we know as well that now you have to be washed and because you have to be cleaned you said Okay I accept the Lord Jesus as my savior and you sold out you say Lord who else do I go to just you and you say Lord your blood is enough but now you have to apply the blood you know because if you look at these Hebrews they were Moses said to them hey you just cover the lentil and the door POS with blood and your firstborn shall live now I want to be very serious if you didn't do it your firstborn was dead so if the word says to you to let something go the word I'm not going to say the g Lord Jesus Christ because he is his word but sometimes we listen to Jesus Christ so much and it's the wrong Jesus Christ you're listening to because you're listening to an enticing Spirit go find it in the word but no I don't have time to read the word because Twitter says this and this and this and this and you'll be deceived the voice is so close it will deceive you children wake up if you're not reading your word your Bible he will deceive you and no matter what any Angel preaches to you if it's contrary to this word do not take it brother brandham said I will believe any experience that a brother would tell me about seeing visions and talking to the Lord I'll believe all of it but if it doesn't matches the word I'll just leave it alone but I will believe it because I don't know how God talks to people that's not my job I know how he speaks to me and it's through his word and his preaches in the adoption series and the whole thing I'm doing is is we're just going to bring the basis because hopefully brother Ben lets me back one day and I if I don't say too many bad things Sister Christine but then we go on with the adoption because the adoption is placing you not just in Christ but positionally in Christ amen so actually saying that you're not just in Jesus Christ but there is a place for you a purpose a expected end that God wants to use you for a certain reason but I will place you there but you have to come a certain way and that's why brother Brandon preached the adoption series he wanted to tell little young ones is even if you're sitting in the Pew and you feel you're nothing in this church don't worry just come my way I will place you in the land cuz the book of Ephesians places the Believers right in the land and the Book of Joshua where Joshua takes the people and places them in the land it's the same old and the New Testament and here God comes to the prophet prophet and he says to us I'm going to place you in your land I'm going to say who you are the bride but I won't get ahead of myself we're not going to go there today so don't worry so I'm just letting you know the sanctification bit is if they did not apply the blood the firstborn died if you don't apply the blood you will die so no matter how much you spoke now to Moses and you spoke to Pharaoh one child lived and one child died it is what it is so if you do not apply the blood if you don't accept the Lord Jesus Christ you don't take his sacrifice that he died for your sin and you don't settle the sin question you haven't started as a Christian in the kingdom of God yet you're still an unbeliever you're still born in sin because the blood didn't strike off that sin but once you've sold out once that blood is applied to your heart and you said Lord by your grace see me through the blood then you're walking with the Lord but we're not there yet I want to ask how do you apply the blood do you know all you Bible readers he says now after the death of the Moses the servant the Lord spake unto the son of n Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is now dead therefore arise go over the Jordan so he's telling them that they should go over the Jordan he's telling them the promised land is through this Waterway right here why would God in Old T Testament do this why didn't he just take them around the Jordan why did he say I want you to cross through some water make sense he says my servant is dead go over the Jordan go over the Jordan if you want to receive the fullness of Christ there's your answer who knows it we preach about it so much acts 238 he says here then Peter said unto them repent be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of your sins and you shall get the gift of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is our Promised Land that's our token yeah so he says there's a way for you to enter into this light way he also says he straight As the gate and narrow as the way Jesus speaking says in few are they that will find that that straight is a Waterway so this is the if you could see in the back TV it looks better this is the big straight of jalra it's a massive thing but it is important because it links two continents together and a lot of trade goes through there and if they have a traffic jam it will be ter terrible but he wants you to go through the water and accept him and be washed by the blood so yes you can't and this is where we as as the message church we differ from people that says I gave my heart to the Lord and now I'm right I had a debate with someone very close to me and they said I don't need to be baptized they said that's wrong that's the devil speaking to you you need to be baptized because if you haven't been baptized you're not a Christian and he said you can't say that I gave my heart to the Lord I said yes that's true but acts 238 said you need to be baptized for the remission of your sin I said why did Jesus Christ get clean and Sanctified before he goes why why did John the Baptist have to to to um baptize Jesus Christ wash the sacrifice so if our Master does it why can't why don't you have to do it and I would like to see John the Baptist go there to Jesus and go go I sprinkle you and uh that's not washing you go to shower for that like a week I'm telling you your mom and dad ain't coming close to you if you're washing you want to get clean you want to fully submerged you want to get as far off the filth and dirt in your life as possible you want to get that out of you so a little bit of sprinkling ain't going to help it you have to go under the water you have to wash all that sin away and come up and it's a it's a it's a sign an outward sign to the rest of all the world here and Beyond the Veil which you can't see and in the other regions to say I am washed in the blood of the Lamb it's an open declaration that's why we doing it it's you saying I take the blood of Jesus Christ I come the way of the despise few few are they that would find it because they're debating about it so I'm always saying this thing for them I said if you want to have the power of Jesus Christ in your life but you don't want to get married to him that's the marriage ceremony if you don't want to get married take his name why are you using his name why can't you just cast demons out in the name of the father but the name of Jesus got power and people use it day in day out but they want to have the titles well I say give me Jesus cuz if I want to sign the checkbook I I want to make sure that Jesus's name is on that checkbook cuz no promise is going to come to pass yes God rewards Faith but the promises of God for his bride is in that this is where we start I'm going to make it short cuz I know we had a long one hang in there with me why did Moses go through the Red Sea so in Egypt brother brandom says here in Egypt they took the mo word of Moses and then they saned them through the blood washed them sins and then they became pilgrims and strangers and claiming where they seeking a city that was promised so even the Israelites had to cross this body of water to go to the promised land on their Journey now they went into the Wilderness and we know why because that was just where they didn't listen and they had to spend 40 years there they could make it so much faster he says oh I copied that one twice sorry okay so here Joshua he goes and he says let's go over the Jordan and they go over the Jordan and guess what they get there don't worry as if a baby never gr they get to the other side of the Jordan and now they're there they're in the promised land and he looks up and he sees those walls and he goes hey you say you're going to give me the promised land I accepted Jesus Christ I got baptized so everything's now fixed and brother col say what nope so we're still going to fight and guess what those cities that you testified of Joshua and Caleb that you said oh it's easy to take I'm going to test you now cuz that's what's waiting for you cuz they said we are more than able to take the land and God says sorry we are more than able to now I'm going to test I'm going to give you a test to have that testimony so be careful what you say oh I can overcome this cancer or I can overcome this depression I okay let's battle with him a bit on your own ability you can't do it but see nice thing that God said like all these things past hurts complexes unforgiveness angers lust depression anxiety sickness self that's the worst one those things are your land they they the jebusites and they all those Hittites and iri ties and everything that's in your way somebody have a ran out of some words there but they they it's the thing that irks you the most it's like why can't I get over this why do I my hair why is it such a thing Lord why can't you deliver me me and it's just sitting there waiting for you and God goes I got the battle no you worry I just I want you to show up and you're like Lord but when my time and then Joshua meets the captain of the host and the captain of the host goes remember God said to you be of a good courage he says but I'm here to take over the battle so I'm just paraphrasing because we I want to make up for time we're almost there so God's saying I'm going to step right into your battle because you came my provided way now I'm on on the scene because you didn't just accept my name you took my name and now you call upon my name now I step into the battle now I can start fighting for you CU you're now in the land hallelujah amen and guess what I thought if we had a long service will be to continue there there's much more hold on now I'll preach a bit there's actually way more but we we'll stop there for now cuz it is halfast 12 man you might want to hear this let's do this one I I'll land it here CU I must I must at least get some attention we're going to a new church we we we we we starting a new Journey we we we have turn the corner because we all accepted the Lord Jesus Christ is a mightier things for us okay but there's more land to possess there's more seeds to be fold there's more things to be done but young people this one is for you you have to still fight for every inch of the ground you stand on you're going to have to fight now I'll tell you as a old Warrior and a and a and a true man that can I like wrestling and fighting you can't pick a battle with someone that you know is going to beat you if you haven't trained before that fight CU they're going to beat you but you want to come in here in a Sunday and 5 minutes before Church get ready and do two push-ups and then think you're going to fight the massive giant isn't that the state of us you know we're like McDonald's eater and burger Fuel and all this La of rubbish food through the week and then we walk in here Wednesday in a 5 minutes God should just do everything when a when a preacher refers to scripture we don't even know where the book is he can give me he can go second opinions 5 and you'll still find it in your Bible you'll be paging the whole time you just hear this I I I'm this guy hey hey he goes okay let's go to the Book of John John John John John first John oh no now you made it difficult come on John first John John Matthew Luke John no not that first John first John your we first John and everybody's reading and Arman still going is it Old Testament how was that guy now I got clever I got a phone so I just go First John 3 well I know where it is I can at least tell you if it's in the new of the Old Testament but I just want to say I was that guy but I never prepared for battle but then I expect God to come on the scene and fight my battle and he said to Joshua he didn't say hey the land is yours go sit there and your your play your guitar and have nice music there by yourself that's all you do playing guitar having a fun oh love you Jesus because see this is a bug bear of me but I'll say it now if you listen more to music then you listen to the message you're out of balance if you listen more to music then you read your Bible you're out of balance I don't care what gospel music it is children that it's lulling you to sleep because I've never seen people overcome in a and and and live a better life in one of y song Services they had an emotional experience there they didn't overcome cuz they didn't have the word they had emotion they had some word but they didn't have the word because they weren't in their Bible but every day you see people with iPods and ear pods and snob pops and my battery is dead so we just stop that one there and they in their own little world being lulled to sleep and you say Hey Brother Hey where did they write about again remember the baptism where is it written I don't know can't really put my finger on it huh where's the seals where was it Revelation or oh yeah I think the book of re solution yeah but that's what they do you I asked some K they where's the Ten Commandments written they couldn't tell me it had to be a debate because I find ourselves we're not in this word we're everywhere but in this word and this is the thing that's going to judge you one day and it's judging you now and you're getting caught out because the word comes over the pulpit and I don't see anybody checking what the preacher is saying not that you have to we had a chat about that yesterday but do you check or is the blind leading the blind then so so every guy on YouTube that has opinion about Jesus Christ and it's not in the word are you just going to follow it see this is what I'm meaning by this fighting fighting is making sure you know your ground making sure you know your weapon making sure you know it works and if the enemy comes in and says it's written you said yeah but it's written also yeah but it's written there and surely you said no it's not surely it's God word hallelujah because the thing is if you're trained in your sword and you're trained in your word you will not be deceived but if you're trained in music Lys and they say and the truth shall set you free I go where does it say set says the truth shall make you free it's a process set free is like I let you go and you're just gone now you can do whatever you want make free is we're going to have a bit of a rubbing session think about it but we accept it because it's been preached over all these songs and you think it's gospel but it's rubbish they sing Trinity Spirit they sing all these other things and we just eating it eating it father son no the father praise to the son praise to the praise to Jesus Christ amen who are you praising you're wasting your time don't be laabi stay in your word I'm about to close we're almost there aen didn't stay with the word and a whole campaign was fought and God said you will not lose one man but aen couldn't stay with the word he had clear instructions when you come to church be prayed up when you come here and you've got a besetting sin that you know you're doing you better strike that off because if somebody comes forward for prayer and they're not getting healed your fault I'm sorry your fault you got unconfessed you bring it into the camp people die you think God is going to turn a blind eye to that one day he will not but if you come here and you put your your your sin and you confess it and you put it under the blood and you start entering into the service people walk forward they get healed miracles happen because God respects the person CU he knows the guy that God you got real help and you in your position can really pray for that person and enter into their burden and you're so the spirit of God and God just moves over the place and then we have the brother Brandon meetings again where he's talking to the sister and he turns to the brother go hey you brother you've got so and so you believe God can heal yeah you're healed what did that brother brandom just the gift of healing it was God and brother brandham that did it I listened to those prayer lines and I just I just cannot believe how God can just come on a scene like that and there was unbelievers in there don't now take it as gospel hear me out but they didn't leave unbelievers and if they left unbelievers they missed the blessing but we as a church we should make sure that when we come here we're ready for battle because our heart is can my sister be healed can my brother be healed my heart before I walk into this church am I singing the right songs brother Josh is this the ones that God placed on my heart because all the songs was leading up to all these testimonies and he was opening a place where there was such an atmosphere that God can move am I in the right place delivering that then God will move in this place very mightily there's a difference I'm going to skip forward this is where brother brandom says that when you bring the sick before us they'll fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast because something is wrong somewhere God made the promise God has to stick with the promise and he will do it so when we see stuff like that starting to happen us as Believers we should take a step back and go hold on Lord you got our taste cuz when 16 men died Joshua stopped the whole campaign they were already set in Array they all already everywhere they were advancing the enemy 16 men di Joshua goes hold on let's stop it let's get back stop stop stop the whole thing now you think you're on the battlefield starting fighting and and say stop what hold on and he walk back he goes sorry what's wrong 16 men die what what do you mean 16 men died we've been fighting a whole campaign not one got a scratch on him no Red Cross no bandages the anointing of God was the 16 men died they all were very sincere to find out what happened there and that's why they did it because they wanted to get that sin out of the camp now getting sent out of the camp is not removing people from under the blood getting sent out of the camp is not pointing fingers getting sent out of the camp is looking to the inside and go Lord what am I doing wrong here because you can't tell me if you look at a dead brother next to you go Lord was it me should I have covered him with my shield should I have my sword out was it what what killed him what was was it out of position was it supposed to be in my position if that is the attitude of the Christian he won't die so when we see people not being healed are we in position are we are we having our Shield of Faith up are we striking at the enemy or are we pitch walking to the guy next to us yeah he's not in position or maybe she's not in position oh and that one Wonder are we reflecting in here because if we could do that God could come back and say well let's Carry On We're All in the right place and people get healed and the gospel moves on we don't have to start back there at at the repentance we don't have to start again accepting the Lord Jesus Christ by faith we've done it already we already been baptized we just have to go Lord I'm sorry I lay it down I move on campaign goes on that's the difference between a mule and a horse mate a real Christian he's a thorough bread you tell a horse and brother brand says you crack a whip over a fough bread and he's gone you say Miracles days of Miracles are still there he goes Hallelujah brother he goes do you believe there's healing in the cup he goes I believe that you believe Jesus Christ saved you he says Lord I remember the very moment they're a different M but the MU sad thing did I get because I lost my slide let me just see where I am there yeah they read the Bible and they believe every word the Bible says they follow instructions that's the thorough bread they receive the same Holy Ghost receive the way she receive it the same results Papa and Mama he knows he Papa and Mama he knows he's been washed by the blood of Jesus Christ born of the spirit filled with a Godly unction he knows where he's standing sure he's in Canan he knows where he come from um and that's the way a real Christan question is ask him have you received the Holy Ghost do you want to know what's a thorough bread when did your life change when did God change your life M he'll take you to that very moment testimony after testimony and this place but a meal I don't know you know the meals you have to always shout at them you have to like kick them to do something great workers but you always have to make him work and they do a lot of work but they just they just pull their ears up and you can say to them hey do you believe the Lord Jesus died for your sin and he's like I don't know there's a lot of opinions about that oh do you do you believe if you come here and you have uncon confessed sin you can kick someone's healing out of oh I don't know brother Brandon was a bit extreme about that oh when I say this message works you should listen more to it y but the tunes are really cool when I say read your Bible oh Twitter is pretty fun and Instagram and all that grams they have excuse for everything you tell them they have excuse they a and they stubborn and hard-headed they a but a thorough bread which is you all they go Lord I want to run like that I just want to run and be free and I want to be in the Holy Spirit I want you to guide me everywhere and and let me touch people's lives and and I want God to reflect in my life I if you say Hey you know be baptized I'll be baptized if you say say you know uh you pray for the sick and they shall be healed get the Elders of the church together we go hey brother cuan come stand I'm sick I need praying for they the ones that breaks the mold they're the ones that hallelujah and amen and and enter into a service and just before they come to church they say we just going to fix it up before I get there Lord is there anything that will hinder me from receiving your your blessing today they check up they know where they are musicians you can go forward because it has been a big one but I was really trying to to go a little bit further but let's stop it there come musicians come up a thorough bread God loves a thorough bread you know why except the Lord builds a house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman keepeth it in vain he speaks about this um this little girl and I'll I'll tell you the story but it is it is also in the adoption series brother Brandon speaks about this little Goldie sorting or dating and uh brother Lee is the dad and uh he says to brother Ben to brother Mar Marion to brother um U Brandon wow think that brother brandom he says come and stay over the night and he says okay I'll come and stay over the night and the the girls are sleeping upstairs and the and him and brother Vale they they at the bottom sleeping there and brother Vale gets a dream and in this dream he dreams that he gets the blueprints of a house I wonder if I do I brother it can you put the blueprints of that house no let's do it I'll do this part we're going to read that and he says he gets this blueprints of the house and he looks at it being a contractor and he says the windows are wrong so he goes when we building the house he says no but before he does that he says to brother brandom I don't believe in the the baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I don't see it and and he leaves it and brother Brandon goes back with him and and he gets this dream and he look and he looks at this blueprint and he sees the windows is wrong and he goes and he changes the plan and he builds the house according to to the windows that he knows is right he says it's absolutely wrong building the windows that way this way is the better way and he builds this house he says he didn't believe it that he was a contractor he says brother brandom I have to read this too small maybe I can get it here he says yeah I just dreamed about it I dreamed that I went up near albery and there was a building in a man's house and it gave me a blueprint but when I seen a certain way the windows was cut and it fixed a certain place I said that's not right it just can't be right that's contrary that isn't right man's opinion he says but I built it the way I thought it was right and when he came back from Florida from his vacation he saw that the house was almost done and he looked at the house and he goes and he gets the blueprint and he looks at that children blueprint he looks at the blueprint he says sorry you've built my house wrong and I said to him no I haven't built your house wrong that is how it is in such and such a place he said well that's really don't belong there he said tear it down if you expect me to pay you you will build it way the blueprint said this is not games the Lord will come back one day we all will be judged according to what we've done here there will be a judging you get your judgment here and we know that in the white Throne judgment we may be right sitting next to him and and ministering upon a lot but brother brandham was standing for a message which Paul preached and he had to be judged and all of us was according to that message be careful when you leave the blue because the blueprint will get when the Lord comes back he says well done my true and faithful servant enter into joys of heaven or did he say you worker of iniquity I didn't know you because the blueprint is asking us to do a certain thing in a certain way it's not for us to interpret he says and then he speaks to brother Bram and brother Bram he says what do you think about that I said is there a creek running down there below the house and we went to it and I said I don't want tearing down on that day I will get it right now and put it according to the blueprint so if anybody fights you according to the blueprint if it's not written in this word it's man's opinion leave it alone amen but if it's in this blueprint stick with it because in the day of judgment this is the only thing that will stand for you is this word of God Amen so I encourage you when you come to service you can take that off there brother Ed and and it's been a such a mixed up service because I had to try to yank through a lot of things this church was built on a blueprint he says if you be humble people and you stay humble people will come and find their rest so if we can stay humble and we stay with the word of God people will send Souls here and they will be saved and they will go into the kingdom of God there will be all his work but let's not get out of the blueprint let's not forget that the little things make sense so kids I encourage you and especially you musos you you got the greatest battle on you because you musos don't let music take the part the the place of the word of God it is a gift it is not the word of God Amen maybe we'll just stand and we'll just pray together um I want to sing that song we sang last again touching Jesus so if you can start playing that please and uh we just pray say Lord Jesus is it's good to know that many of testimonies has come through this church father and and that we all a witness of your great love and mercy upon our life Lord but we also do know Lord that there's certain things that you've placed within this message and within the the message of our hour Lord that we know is very crucial to to walking with you and being in fellowship with you father so we thank you for that Lord and we thank you for revealing it to us we don't want to push any promise and and bring it to pass before you bring it to pass Lord but we just want to say Lord as we stay in the in the letter of your word father may you just always keep us in your hand father and guide us through that Promised Land we know there's going to be a fight Lord we're just like Joshua and Caleb all eager to say we can take it Lord and we might have a Jericho right here before us right now Lord but you said be of a good courage go and fight cuz I will be there so we know that we lord we know you've got the battle but Lord let us not go so high into the heavenlies that we forget the little bit basic stuff here that's so important to to to introduce our children to you and the ones that comes into the church there is no other way there is no other way you're the only way the truth and the life Lord so we know that and we just want to say thank you for the testimony of this church standing for more than 10 years now Lord bringing souls to glory Lord and and being a light here in Stokes Valley and we know you're going to move it on and we thank you Lord Brother Ben and all the brothers that was part of this Vision Lord we thank you for them we ask Lord guide us as we go to our new pray Lord help us to have love father help us to check up ourselves before we even go to church every day father and just get us in the right Spirit Lord and in the right atmosphere father so so that you can have preeminence Lord and we don't miss your your visitation please Lord and bless brother Ben and and brother Isaac it's uh about an hour and a half 2 hours before the service starts there Lord I pray you do something special for them today oh God you I pray that you just go that way Lord and you just show that you are still the Living God the same yesterday today and forever Lord and you just Lord do something special May a great testimony come back for your kingdom Lord and we thank you for the
