========================================
[Music] for [Music] praise the Lord hello welcome to the house of God um this morning am mean it's good to it's good to be here it's good to um already feel the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and in our and our our midst this morning I believe we're in for uh we're going to have a good time in the Lord this morning um and I would like to uh just thank each and every one of you you for your um yeah just your nice messages of condolence and and prayers and that from um after my my brother passed away it was I really felt a uh you can feel the prayers of the Saints you know when you when you you sort of wonder why do I feel this way it's more more probably better than what I should be feeling you know you feel good you feel there's something there's something extra going on around you that that that you can't quite pinpoint but you know there's that that it's the it's the answered prayers of the Saints and and um yeah it was uh it's it's I'm we we bit tired a little bit tired today it's been a you know we we yeah I I live under a quite a high pressured I live a sort of quite a high pressured life anyway so this is and and and to add another quite a powerful emotional sort of Journey on that is it it makes your mind a little bit but I'm glad to be refresh in the Holy Ghost um this morning and yeah but I mean it's a sad it's a very sad time for the family for my brothers children for my parents for the siblings and that um you know and but I'm glad as a Christian you know like like like for me I've built my life upon the word of God so I can declare that when the storms of life come I stand you know you know people may make fun of the the things of God and that and Bel little at all you know but you let a storm hit sometime and you know all the ridicule is worth it then and all the all what you go through is worth it then when you can hold through any storm it just you just hold you know so I I thank God for that that that as Paul said none of these things move me you know we where as Believers you know we we build our life upon the word of God and we can stand so we're here this morning to praise the Lord and and we're going to have a great time in the Lord and I just just as a notice we could we do the choir practice sort of change the vibe a bit but I just want to make sure we get can we do the choir practice straight after church will that be okay you have a good little breakfast this morning cuz it'll be a little bit longer till you get lunch okay but we'll try and cuz some of the Brethren are not actually staying for lunch they got to they're going away to different places so if we could sort of stay straight after church including you Bruce [Laughter] okay so that'll be straight away so yeah praise the Lord let's stand this morning and and um yeah but the the the Lord willing I'm actually ministering next weekend and and some of the what the experiences that I've been through which were quite powerful will sort of weave into the thought I had in light of what's happened so yeah just that I maybe I may share a little bit a bit more then because we we serve such a powerful God you know and there's that the the the way that is the the the way that God's mind works is outstanding and the power that he has and and the power that he has to reach places and do things is outstanding you know and I've experienced a bit of that you know when he stretches forth his hand just a little bit further you think I wonder if God can reach there and he just reaches down to that point you know so yeah let's let's the Lord willing will sort of speak on a bit of that next week because I think brother Ben's away what oh did okay so everyone knows this um aby's birthday is far much for his is this weeking this Sunday coming so week

Unseen hits Our Lives Lord when things we don't know that are going to happen when they when they come Lord then it's in those times Lord we're so glad that we serve the Unseen God Lord that we can

amen praise God Amen thank you brother Isaac thank you musicians amen God bless you all this morning amen um we're just going to turn to the scripture this morning just a couple of announcements we're going to have communion foot washing on Wednesday um we're going to have choir practice straight after the service um here and it's also Omar noes last Sunday is that right okay so at the end we'd like to pray with you if that's okay before you before you before you go back but it's been wonderful having you here and God bless you amen and yeah we certainly want to just give our condolences once again to to brother Isaac and Elise and amen um amen it's amazing to see God God is greater than all these things in God's hand and even in tragedies and loss and amen but let's um let's go to Revelations chapter 12 we're going to we got another reading in Exodus but I thought we're just just read this and then um we're going to go into Exodus 12 amen who's happy to be a Christian today amen Camp soon praise God looking forward to that amen praise the Lord so Revelations 12: 7 I know is very familiar probably one of my favorite favorite scriptures I always like to read the end of the book and when I read a book and see who wins and who doesn't where you know and praise the Lord when you can see yourself in the end of the book amen so and there was war in heaven Michael and his Angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not I put that in yellow CU I like those words he didn't win neither was there Place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and their love not their lives unto the death amen so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen if you want to be remembered in prayer just just raise your hands to the Lord amen God sees every need every desire amen let's pray together gracious Heavenly Father truly Lord our hearts desires that you Lord you'd re upon us with your spirit Lord there' be Showers of Blessings Lord Showers of refreshing from your presence oh God this morning so we just want to commit Our Lives into your hands once again Lord we just want to invite you to where we are father every situation we're walking in Lord may you just come and take over and have your way in our lives and mold us and shape us more into your image Lord and I pray father that Lord as uh as we read your word today or as we have read your word as we go through Lord this uh service I pray when it's all said and done we'd appreciate you more we'd love you more we'd have more confidence what you have done for us Lord we love you we thank you for what you've done We Praise You Lord be with those who could be here today as well Lord we commit them into your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats too uh uh this morning so I want to speak about I know this is um you know the Christian journey is actually a very simple one and actually walking in Victory is actually a very simple thing it's not a complicated the Christian Life is a very simple thing man makes it complicated the devil sure wants to make it complicated but it's very simple now as we as we read here they overcame and by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony okay so that scripture is prophesying of you right you're living out that scripture whether you realize that if you're a Christian you believe this morning you're living that scripture out sure there's going to be battles like the brother like brother Ram said the devil will punch at you but he can't get you right but he'll fight you and do all he can but we got to realize we're going to overcome right and we are overcoming if you got faith in your heart this morning you've got overcoming power amen so now we're going to look into because the blood Yo God has put such a perfect barrier between us and the devil a perfect weapon a perfect armor A Perfect Defense amen but it's when we try and inject ourselves into it or you know if we try and emphasize well what do we have to do and do we have to protect ourselves no the blood protects us now if I may sound a bit flippant I'm not sounding flippant today okay but I want you to have full confidence in your defense full confidence in your weapon full confidence in your God because if there's ever a people upon the face of the plan am mean that can have full confidence in who the Lord is and what he has done it is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen because the True Believer does not inject his own human Works into his salvation or his victory amen no the True Believer has full confidence and what the Lord has done and he allows God to manifest that victory in their lives amen so this is where we are now I just want to go if you want to turn to me or you can just read it up here but you know I want to read about in the first Exodus there a there was instructions we know you we've been reading through Exodus as a family uh you as a chapter of night you with family prayer and so we just read recently this you know we are into the time where you know they've just danced on the other side of the Red Sea and maybe we'll come to that in a few Sundays I don't know but this is where we were not not that long ago but God tells Moses he says you know God comes down to a point where he's he's he's plagued Pharaoh long enough now it's time to leave now it's time to leave amen so you know there'll be a time when we leave but we must must be prepared to leave but God gives instructions here and and I'm just going to read it through it's a bit lengthy but we're going to go down to uh verse 17 but says and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you why because a new life is going to start right they've been in slavery now there's a transition they ain't going to be in slavery no more amen now speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall be your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it from your sheep or from the goats now remember this is this is in type speaking of our Lord Jesus he is our Passover right so when we when we have this uh have this in mind there's a spiritual application we're going into now I know this is all familiar to all of but there is a pro you fear comes in among Believers when they say have I done enough all we are required to do is is is let God fulfill his word in our lives so God gives the word and then we allow it to live right so Moses told them take the lamb as we're reading take the blood apply the blood right they all they had to do was obey the word right that's all they had to do it's very it's it's not rocket science right it's not so okay and you shall keep it till the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening they shall take the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door poost of the houses R they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat it eat not of it raw nor Soden it all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinent Parts thereof so they're instructed don't boil this lamb don't dilute this lamb don't add a bit of water to this lamb you got to roast it with fire so now we know our lamb is the Lord Jesus he is the word right so we are like they did they became one with their sacrifice right before I know I've said this byi every communion service but before this happened you'd see a family and a lamb then you saw no longer the lamb but then you saw the blood on the doorpost and then you saw the people walk out in the morning right they became one with their sacrifice and they left Egypt under the strength or by the strength of that lamb amen so it comes with us now there's the message but the message and you must become one you and the word must become one you see it was no good for them in Israel now notice here Moses does not say here you must be an Israelite believer to do this anyone could apply the blood anyone could apply the blood no matter how bad how good how how whatever they are whatever their past was that's irrelevant God wasn't looking at the ones in the house he was looking at the blood on the house that's what he was looking at he says when I see that blood not when I see you when I see the blood I will pass over you so it doesn't matter the condition of the Israelite before they applied the blood God wasn't looking at them anyhow I mean it's the same thing with you and I friends God is not looking at us he's looking at the blood but we look at ourselves we're looking at the wrong thing and we build up pressure because we look at ourselves but if we look at the blood we can let off the pressure rejoice and have full confidence God is going to protect us amen because the blood uh the death Angel went into he could not go into any of those houses where the blood was applied it was impossible for him to do it amen it was impossible it's the same thing when when that Death Angel because there's spiritual death riding the land today we understand that there's spiritual death that's on to come into churches come into houses come into individual lives and all these things but he cannot bypass or over go over the blood he cannot go beyond that barrier it's a perfect barrier amen and now we understand now I hope I'm not jumping here to my well just come to here they had to they had to have burn the whole lamb they had to roast the whole lamb they couldn't take that lamb and Butcher and just get the nice chops they couldn't just get parts of the word that they liked amen if the word said that your hair grow Out Sisters they let it grow out they ate that part amen if it said to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they ate that part they became one with that part right they didn't just say well I don't like that that's not to my taste none of us you know I'm sure we'd all agree I don't I wouldn't want to eat the whole lamb naturally I want certain parts we're all we're all very familiar you know with this you know I very rarely see a hunter come out of the Bush and he's got all the intrs of the deer no you don't Bry that okay but we got to take the whole word we can't just take the bits that are convenient that are sociably acceptable we must take the whole word and become one with it see it was no good on that day to sympathize with what Moses was saying see you got to be not just a hearer of the word but a doer of the word it says in James right so and now I know I'm looking at people who are doers of the word amen all right but you see and it's also now it says don't eat it raw nor Soden it at all with water so there got to be some fire in this I mean there's got to be some fire burning as you're eating the word as you're eating the lamb it can't be it can't be boiled right it's got to be there's got to be a Holy Ghost and Fire Burning in your souls as you as you eat the lamb amen as you take of the word there's got to be a fire there and it can't be a man-made fire it can't can't be just man-made enthusiasm or or or a human self-will that I'm going to be a Christian no there's got to be a fire there of the Holy Ghost amen there's got to be there's got to be some you know who loves you know the roast lamb comes out of the oven I want that the door may be half open I want that cuz it's been roasted it's being burn it's hot you know and the same thing with the word there's got to be a holy ghost fire burning in your soul as you partake of the word amen it can't be it can't be boiled it can't be diluted with water it can't be anything like that no it must be roasted with fire amen but the thing is he says thus you shall eat it with your loines GED your shoes on your feet and your staff on your hand and you shall eat it in haste for it is the Lord's Passover so now it's it it it seems very contrary if you think naturally when you invite people for a meal they don't come in and sit at your table dressed to go out in the outdoors normally you come in and sit and comfortable cloth to eat right so but they instructed you've got to be dressed to leave when you eat this lamb I mean because you're preparing to leave the applying of the blood the eating of the Lamb the sacrificing of the Lamb all these things is that is is is you are leaving here but they were instructed to stay in their house under the blood until marching orders came right they were ready to leave at any time but they had to stay in Passover until until marching orders came to leave now we are going to have marching orders to leave one day that Trump the dead and Christ are going to raise right that's time that that's when it's going to be you're leaving this Earth bride right but until that time we must stay under the blood in Passover with our lamb until marching orders come now we understand communion is a is a is a relationship right when we say we're taking communion it's more than just an ordinance of the Bible you know fulfilling the scripture but it's showing you have you have a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ where he talks to you and you talk to him amen that it's an everyday Affair that that it's it's you and him together walking walking life's journey so this communion we we are told to stay in communion now let let's just get this out here everyday simple Christian Living is overcoming don't go after shiny things don't go after the new Fantastics of things walk with God and His word every day amen if you see the purpose of every day then you'll be victorious Joseph remember Joseph was so gripped by those two dreams that one day his family will bow to him he'll be in a place of leadership that he let his life be governed by that but what was he doing he was serving in Piper's house he was there in the prison he became the leader of the prison he was all these things but he was every day he was gripped by the fact that he was going to end up to fulfill that dream and God was going to cause that dream to be fulfilled so every day he saw the purpose of every day now every day was probably there probably wouldn't would not have been a lot of difference from Monday to Friday in a prison and Saturday Sunday too right or even pipus house it would have been very similar maybe things would change with Seasons different jobs will come up but it'll be a very similar life but he realized that this was all for his good to shape him because he was going to end up amen there at the right hand of pharaoh literally Pharaoh over Egypt right so we've got to see the value of everyday Christian Living right because we got to realize that if we stay in Passover now we're going to be living a life amen that's going to be on display through the whole world because words are very cheap I say words have never been cheaper than they are today people will give you all kind of promises give all kind of word salers get all kind of things but it's a life it's a character it it seems very strange nowadays character is very undervalued in this day it used to be politicians character was important now it's not important you can look at the presidential election here in you know there in the United States I'd say character is not even brought into it it's empty promises and word salads both sides it's a mad house but the world has to go mad and it is mad but you see character is a very cheap I mean in the eyes of man it's not really valued Much Anymore moral values and how men should be women should be in our character and even just being true to our word you know how many agreements do we sign contracts and there's so many sub Clauses and things to make sure you have to fulfill your your end of the bargain when it just used to be yeah I'll do it and if I can't do it I'll tell you if I can't do it it used to be that way so words are very cheap and character is not valued anymore but I say in The Bride of Jesus Christ because God values character God values genuine Christian character that you be a true representation your life is a true representation of the word of the Lamb because remember they walked out of Egypt by the power of that lamb the lamb was in their belly it gave strength to their limbs amen it caused them to walk out Amen in the morning right and it's the same thing with you and I it may sound contrary because I'm saying we're staying in Passover but we're walking at the same time right but you got to stay in fellowship with your lamb CU you see the things you eat are the things you become that's why that's why society's become so such a chaos it is today is because people have been living off amen the the cup of iniquity of the great not just religiously but entertainment wise remember there's Two Babylons one's in Rome one's in one's in Al they're both judged separate way you read Revelations 18 they're shown in two different things but you see the world has become drunk on those things and they have now embodied what has been dished out and I pray that we've be we've embodied what has been dished out amen by the message of the hour amen that we embody what a true Christian should be amen that Christian values should not be something we're trying to obtain to we see it living because of the power of the Lamb the life of the Lamb that's within us amen so now this would be a this would be thing that they had to stand now when you when you stand fellowship with the Lord there's a sweetness there is a joy there's a peace that passes all understanding right in spite of the worst situation in life you can have a joy and a peace that humanly makes no sense and it's not based on circumstance it's a condition that you're in because you're having communion with your God right you're feeding on the lamb I mean you're feeding on his word you're not you're not caught up in what's going on sure there's times we feel overwhelmed humanly right doesn't make doesn't mean we're just emotionally disconnected and that's how we know but there's a peace that when you really sit down you really think on the Lord and every in the situation you're in there's something that bubbles up who's with me on this I mean I trust you've all experienced this there's a peace that passes all understanding that's not about your your the condition you're in and it's because you're eating the lamb you're in communion as you're walking with God Amen you're staying under the blood having fellowship with our God amen praise the Lord now let's just let's just come down to this now I know I know there's a lot of many times people emphasize uh a phrase that brother Braham uses if you go study the token sermons he emphasizes this this phrase full obedience to the full word of God whole word of God entitles you to the Token right and then what happens is straight away is people now I may have said this before but I'm going to say it again now people what they do is they take the message and make it a checklist of things I must be obedient to but brother Bram never says that's what full obedience means no he because he says it here he says full obedience to the whole word of God to God's entire word will entitle you to this token how do you do it Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the token amen so so to me that casts down every scarecrow because that's why fear Creeps in have I done enough am I doing enough and what happens is I I believe we're all sincere people we want to serve the Lord we want to closer walk with him where we are we're thankful for but we want more of him right so the devil plagues plagues us he uses our own sincerity against us amen so you see what happens is we begin to people begin to worry now have I done enough to make sure the blood is applied and the Death Angel can't get me well this is what you must do right because if you receive the Holy Ghost now the life in your lamb has come unto you and that life of the lamb now lives out of you right we know under the blood of bulls and goats there in there in Egypt there they could not the life of their sacrifice could not come in and change them because humans have souls animals do not have souls so the life in the lamb the nature of the Lamb could never come into them and make them lamb likee right that's why they had to continue to offer sacrifices and all these things it could not change them but when the Lord Jesus the true Lamb of God came I mean when he died on Calvary his blood was shed out of his body amen the life of that blood which is the Holy Ghost God's own life was now released Upon A people that whosoever believeth amen amen that that life now of your lamb your sacrifice comes into you and you receive God's nature amen amen and as you walk with him more and more what happens is your nature goes and his nature increases because really maturity in Christ is you see more of God in your life every day that's what maturity really is it's not even understanding all the Mysteries though we do know those things but that's not true maturity maturity is the life of the Lamb takes dominance over you am mean and the things that once toss you to and fro that don't toss you too too and throw anymore why because his life is having more preeminence amen aren't you glad I mean see see Christian you it's such a simple thing to be a Christian it's such a simple thing and and man does not like simple things we want great gadgets the greatest the best the furthest the fastest all these things but God says no it's not the shiny great things that people project is great no it's humble Meek Simplicity of God Amen so you see now if you've been if you've repented really repented and been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you shall receive this token amen that that is full obedience to the word of God and if anyone puts any other scarecrows along your way forget it forget the Scarecrow amen because if you fully if you fully surrendered to the word of God his Spirit comes into you it'll start living out of you there'll be something that comes into you when you when you start to put a foot wrong God will say I don't want to do that I don't like that you shouldn't have done that and then what are you sorry Lord amen praise God aren't you glad he becomes the inside teacher I mean he can he he convicts you of sin when you've done wrong yes my Lord amen he guides you amen he doesn't he doesn't leave you but you see now the thing is we got to be careful what we eat I'm just coming back to that I I I said it earlier because Jesus would say Beware of the liven of which is the doctrine of the Pharisees scribes and Pharisees see the see the disciples thought he was talking about natural bread when he's saying beware of their leaven but he's saying no it's their Doctrine their teaching because what happens is the bread may look the same just like the word may look the same but what it produces will be very different you see this way he's saying beware beware their Doctrine because it will it will change your communion because he'd say because look at what it produces but all their Works they do to be seen of men now when when our lord Jesus was here he didn't go on promotion tours he didn't have a lot of adver the only advertising he had was was was people that he touched and it's amazing how many times he would say to people don't tell anyone about it he said no don't tell don't say anything but of course the person's just been delivered they've been set free how can they not well people said different what happened happened to you and they think he said not to say but I've got to say you see but he didn't he didn't publicize look how great I am look how awesome I am no he was the meek humble lowly man of Galilee but yet he was the Lord of creation and flesh he was God manifested In the Flesh he was the greatest one the greatest man that will ever walk upon the Earth as him amen the greatest one but yet he did not boast he didn't say this is how yeah I'm the greatest thing look at how great I am no there was no big shot in him he he didn't want to be the center of attention he wanted his father to be the center of attention even he'd say to his disciples it's not me that doeth the works it's the father that dwelleth in me doeth the works see so he didn't bring any he didn't he didn't try and get any praise for himself but you see but but you see cuz he was eating the right bread if I can put it that way he was having the right communion with his father am mean the same spirit that should be in you and I the Holy Ghost but you see now the Liv of the scribes of Pharisees they wanted to say look at how great I am look at how wonderful I am look at what I'm doing and it was all empty but all their Works they do to be seen of men they make broad their whatever that word is and you know basically they they make their clothes fancy to look great enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uttermost room at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues the greetings in the markets to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi whomsoever shall exalt himself shall be a beast and he that himself himself shall be exalted you see so they really wanted worship this is what their Liv produced they wanted worship that's why what are greetings like this have the greatest part oh great Rabbi we're so glad you're here all these things they were looking for worship their leaven was the actually this is what the devil wants the leav was the wrong Le so there was no joy there was all they cared about was I want to be the biggest one the the smartest one the greatest one the deepest one all these things this is this is what they were striving to achieve but it didn't it didn't do them no good you see a woman at the well who was a Samaritan knew more of the scripture than them Legion knew more than them Peter James and John ignorant fishermen knew more than them you see and of course in those days a rabbi would just come and call his disciples and obviously Peter James and John they were passed over a long time ago that's why they weren't a disciple of anyone but Jesus said no you're my disciple hallelujah amen you see even this came into the galatian church you see they started off see um I love it how the Apostle Paul puts this here he says now this I'll just read from verse one oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth uh before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what I learn of you received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or the hear ing of Faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit you're now made perfect by the flesh see he's saying look you started this way but why have you gone off onto this that it's your own ability that will perfect you how did how did the Spirit come by the hearing of Faith so they started off in the right Passover but something was injected in that the sweetness and the joy and the victory Of God was gone and now became a self-focused self-centered walk of how am I doing am I doing enough this is what they were doing amen but the Apostle Paul said no no no I'm going to give you the right bread again because you're God's children you've gone off but I'm going to God's going to bring you back this is why I'm writing to you amen this is you know so so he'd say no you started this way but you've gone off he says uh this is verse five here he therefore that minister to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you do he do it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith so he's saying no it's not by the work of the Lord God comes and manifest himself among you it's not your own ability and keeping the word in your own strength that's what I say it's got It's not a man-made fire that the Lamb's got to be roasted in it's got to be a holy ghost fire burning in the heart because if there's a holy ghost fire burning in the heart well you say how do I know I have that do you have a desire to please God to serve him the fire's on baby it's burning don't let it go over your head if you have a sincere desire remember brother Braham had an interview with a sister Bruce and God used used her in the body how how she was used she had a burden for prayer and different things and then you know and but and God has used her you can go through the message and see her life is recorded through the message not just that interview and God's been working with her working through and all these things and she comes to brother Braham saying I don't know if I have the Holy Ghost or not this is a question and and she is trusting the gift in his life is going to show him a vision that God will say actually at this moment this happened you've got it but brother Master um answers who her question with a simple question one day you're going this way now you're serving God you're going this way and he asked the question what did that and you can hear her say Christ and he says there it is see such a simple thing such a simple thing but he's saying you got the Holy Ghost sister Bruce God is using you in the body but your problem is the devil uses your own nature against you amen God built us all a certain way but we've got got to be say Lord we got to be very aware when the devil uses like if you're very melancholic you get down in the dumps you get blue and all these things so you built that way for God to use you a certain way but that's the devil using it against you right and there's all the other oh I don't have it on me but there's all the other different kind of personalities right God built you a certain way but you see it can be such a simple thing when God came and met you and changed your life but you got to stay in communion with your Lord amen if that's okay you see the the lamb gave them strength to go all the way to the promised land Moses would say to them if I can if I can find it he'd say he'd say that your shoes didn't wear out see this is verse 5 here I've LED you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not wax and old upon you and your shoes are not wax and old upon thy foot so the clothing that they dressed in when they left Egypt was still just as strong wasn't worn out wasn't damaged remember they they didn't they didn't walk up a nice sidewalk they didn't walk on nice green grass everything's nice they went through desert conditions they went through hard conditions but God was saying your your natural clothing is not worn out amen from the day you left Egypt to the day you are today I say if you're in Passover if you your if God has met you the blood the Holy Ghost has been applied to your life amen the Garment you're wearing to leave won't can't wear out amen the the righteousness of the saint amen it doesn't wear out it doesn't get old you don't need to change it amen but you're dressed and ready to leave amen but you see they had to realize they had 40 years they didn't even realize really what had happened he says God has not shown you until this day do I have that with me no it's not there but you go read Deuteronomy 29 he says God has not given you a heart to oh there it is no yeah verse four yet the Lord has not given you a heart to perceive eyes to see and ears to hear until this day they didn't fully grasp what was what what had happened that's amazing they went all the way through it but they didn't grasp what had happened let the T on the way to Aus they living in the greatest week of History the death Buri resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ they walked with the resurrected Messiah for 6 hours and he was opening the word breaking the bread to them feeding them amen hallelujah they were in Passover communion with their lord and they and they went there and he broke the bread in the house and their eyes came open amen because they did not have a heart to perceive or eyes to see for that 6-hour journey of a sermon of fulfilled prophet prophecy but God stayed with them just like he stayed with them amen till finally their eyes came open and they realized they're part of the vision God has delivered them and they're fulfilling prophecy and God's fulfilling prophecy in their lives amen hallelujah see you see now I believe this is the hour where really our our our hearts God has opened our hearts to fully perceive we're safe under the blood amen he's given us eyes of understanding they realize no the blood of Jesus Christ is more than enough it's not equal it's not just it's more than enough amen the Simplicity of the power of the blood amen and how you know how the how the life in that blood because because we know the chemistry of that blood is gone even if I had even if this was I know this is not this is olive oil but if this was the blood of Jesus Christ it would be a very sacred thing but it wouldn't do me any good now that may sound funny but if I if I poured his physical blood upon me that would give me an emotional experience but it wouldn't actually change me it has to be the life of the blood has to come into me and change me right that is the most important thing is when his life comes into you that shows that you're one with your sacrifice amen so now we can say the life of the blood the Holy Ghost comes into church amen we say we have the blood of Jesus Christ because of the spirit of the blood amen comes into church comes and dwells in the believer amen comes and washes us white as snow hallelujah amen Keeps Us in communion Keeps Us in Fellowship Keeps Us in the way walking with him amen praise the Lord but you see now this blood is the greatest barrier the Holy Ghost is the greatest barrier that's in existence nothing can pass through it nothing can get through it you say well what about Eve I say no Eve was God allowed that to happen for the fall to come right but he had to have his Plan of Redemption lived out right so now the people who are the beneficiaries of redemption amen God makes us in condition that we cannot fall we'll be tested we'll be tried we'll be tempted amen but the devil will never re over our lives like he caused it like he caused with Adam and Eve because of the blood that because of the protection that we're under amen he may bombard you day after day but he can't get you amen because remember I think it says in the Book of Job that a man will become a hiding place amen and our and our God is our Hiding Place amen he's our Strong Tower amen but we've got to have full complete confidence in his blood see we we are living in a day where the revelation of the power of the blood is more than enough is here it's not the blood and your own Good Conduct right we believe in Good Conduct we believe in Christian Living we believe in being honest right we believe in forgiving we believe in being sincere and genuine and right we We Believe those things don't we cuz we live it out right we well we let God live it out of us right but you see in former ages it was it was the blood and your own Good Conduct entitled you to Salvation or right but it is not that it is the blood alone when Paul wrote that we're saved amen it's let's let's just go to uh Ephesians chapter 2 now you think about this man that would write these you know God would give these Revelations too he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees the Pharisees added hundreds of laws on top the law of Moses and he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees basically saying I'm a good Pharisee I'm not all talk I really did it but then here' come so I don't have it up there but can you can you can you go to um tal can you just uh jump over to Ephesians chapter 2 and then he would um amen and and I would just like verse verse eight now this these kind of scriptures are not Baptist scriptures they are not just some confession of Faith this is bride scripture am mean because it's by Grace you are saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God just like Moses instructions that the so the death angel would not strike the Israelites in Egypt that was a gift of God that wasn't their own selves working it out and their own no God said this is how you're going to be safe when death strikes this land amen and same same thing we are saved by gra through grace through faith amen so God gives you Faith amen his grace comes into your life and it delivers us amen and is not of ourselves it's not your Good Conduct how many people I've spoken to they say well basically their their whole argument of why they're not a Christian is I'm not good enough that has nothing to do with it I me I remember you know before I met the Lord I was on this roller coaster because I had it in my mind hopefully I say this the right right way round the devil had it had me under this cloud of if I'm good enough for long enough I'll get the Holy Ghost no it is not you am it if you get your eyes off you and get your eyes on your lamb then you'll get the benefits of the Lamb amen you get the life of the Lamb the power of the Lamb the overcoming nature of the lamb but if your eyes are upon you even in your Christian Journey then you're going to be you're going to be disappointed because you're looking at you right but if you just look at the power of the Lamb you see so so I had that in my mind if I'm good enough for long enough and then of course I was never good enough for long enough but when came to a place of full surrender amen that's when he stepped in we we all got to come to the end of ourselves sometimes it can take decades sometimes it doesn't take that long but we all got to come to that point where I say I can't do this lord I can't be a Christian Lord I cannot I cannot do it you've got to help me Lord and he just stands there saying I've been waiting for you to do that Hallelujah because he's a gentleman he doesn't force himself upon anyone so we're save so so here was the Pharisee of the Pharisees and he would receive this Revelation for by Grace you are saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so it's not nothing but the blood in your own works or nothing but the blood of my own Good Conduct no it's nothing but the blood of Jesus what does that mean I just get all LAX and loose no if God ever reveals for you what he did for you on Calvary if he ever does it it changes your whole world it changes your whole nature it changes your whole desires it changes your whole life you cannot remain the same amen if it's just a story well it's just a story I remember in my own life when it was just a story but when his love was shed abroad My Heart by his holy ghost I realized how much he loved me because he died me on Calvary and how much I love him because of it amen now so I feel like we're running out of time here you say well how can we walk and how can we how can we uh be in Passover at the same time well well David would say thou H has prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointeth my head with oil and my cup runneth over so David knew what it was like to stay in Passover stay in communion amen with God hallelujah and this caused a certain effect in his life what his cup runs over and he was amen and he was anointed praise the Lord the Galatians started this way but they went off into their own ability then God brought them back amen hope this is okay this morning amen now remember the life I'm just going to read a bit of this here now well let's let's actually jump up here because a picture uh is a thousand words now I just found this I like I like emotion in pictures now here is the now I don't know if exactly this way with the eldest son holding the Basin of blood you know we know the father would have applied the blood to the house and uh yeah and there's maybe the mom there with the lamp and all these things but to me to me this embodies the whole thing now we are all the head of the house individually right you've all got to apply the blood let the blood be applied the Holy Ghost come into your life yourself there's an individual Affair between you and God okay but you see you have here now the the father has heard the word of Moses he says amen I believe that we're leaving let's get ready amen we've been here long enough slavery is over we're going out amen so he takes the lamb he kills the lamb they've already roasted it you know they uh you know it's ready and they take the blood as that's going on and then he applies the blood to the the the lintle in the two side posts of the of the door showing now that the that the Holy Ghost should not just be applied to your flesh or applied to your spirit it's got to be applied to your soul it's got to be in all of you not just anoint you not just heal your body but it's got to dwell in your soul amen and now there's the there's the mom she's she's thrilled look at the smile on her face praise God God's taking us out of here but you see the oldest son he's he's not so sure what's really going on Dad I don't really understand now you see if you have that kind of expression the reason she is happy and and the son is concerned maybe one CU he's the son death can strike him but too she has a revelation like her husband does we're safe we're the the blood is being applied we're safe but he's not so sure about it and you see it's when you're not so sure and and the reason he wouldn't be so sure is because he doesn't have the full confidence in the word through the prophet and the applying of that word in the life right but you see and and that's where pressure builds up because he begins to get worried have we done enough my life is on the line what's going to happen to me is this really going to work that's where pressure builds up that's where the focus goes from the blood to yourself who's following me on the S right you see so so there's pressure now on him because he's the eldest he can die you know his life is in Jeopardy and when we really become sober enough we realize our lives are in Jeopardy we got to be sure that our Eternal destination is secure right so so then now you know after this all done they're in the house they're having the Passover feast there the unliving bread and the and the lamb burnt with bitter herbs they eating this but you know no doubt the father and the mother they're just they're happy they're thankful they're rejoicing maybe it's a sober time but it's a thankful time you know sometimes you know when God really affects me I get real quiet because the magnitude of what he's done become so real and maybe it's like that they're eating maybe tears are going down their cheeks but you know he's you know the sun is all antsy he's getting stressed he's worried because you know what's going to happen to me and is this really going to work and then eventually he can't take it anymore as he hears maybe there's a there's a sound on the outside the death angel has come down into come down into Egypt and he hears maybe a few a few houses up the street where maybe an Egyptian family lives maybe a family just didn't apply the blood and they hear a scream and it's a Mourning and begins to sweep through the land because there was a great cry that that night the Bible says there's never been a cry like it you know and then and then and and then that cry is getting maybe closer to where he lives and he just can't take anyone says Dad do you hear what happened you hear Little Johnny's dead I can hear his parents crying what about us are we going to be okay and he'd say and then his father cuz he got a revelation come here son see what we're reading this is Jehovah's lamb God's provided a lamb for us son you held the Basin of blood son you saw me apply the blood that's what the prophet told us he's got thus sayith the Lord hallelujah you hear those cries son they can't come into this house they can't come here son why dad is it cuz we're good enough is it because we're Abraham's Our Father no son it's because of this lamb that's why your mom's so happy son that's why I've got peace just let off the pressure son let off the pressure don't be stressed about your walk anymore don't be so burdened about if you're good enough for long enough and am I really going to make it let off the pressure I mean God has provided a perfect lamb it's not a denominational lamb it's not a lamb of man's ideas no it's a lamb of God the pure word of God Amen has been has been sacrificed on our behalf and we've applied the blood you can let off the precious son you can relax am me when death is striking the world you can relax and be at peace son because this is a sign that blood because he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you Dad are you sure but what if there's a gap there ain't a gap son there ain't a gap the blood's covered us he can't get inside let off the pressure I'll say this to you let off the pressure stop putting the burden on yourself to fulfill the word of God let God be the Christian in you let him mold you and change you let just stay in Passover with your lamb don't eat all this bread that makes the pressure be on you amen amen let off the pressure you say am I accepted was their blood accepted is our lamb has he not been accepted well how do you know he's been accepted he rose one of my favorite scenes in the whole Bible Mary goes to the tomb thinks he's a gardener he calls it by name hallelujah amen all of her despair turned to Joy and Elation he's alive but but but but he says don't touch me yet I haven't ascended I'm going to ascend to my God and your God my father and your father Hallelujah so what he took his blood up into into Glory it was accepted why because the Holy Ghost was poured out on the day of Pentecost that's the proof that the blood was accepted because none other blood could cleanse a human soul that God himself could Tabernacle in that person am mean so his blood was accepted and it was proved because the Holy Ghost was poured out on the day of Pentecost and I'll say that same Holy Ghost is poured out in 2024 amen proving amen the blood still works amen the blood is still there amen we still have a Living Sacrifice a living ad Jesus Christ the righteous hallelujah hallelujah amen so we can let off the pressure he say what about my family God gave you a revelation for you you pray till that Revelation is for them and then you can walk in confidence you see I think brother Greg brought it up about the fears that job had came upon him he applied the blood and praise God he did but he's doing it out of fear we should not be Christians out of fear we should be Christians out of love thankfulness and Faith amen remember because he did not call you to lose you he saved you to keep you amen and so just stay and Passover with your lamb stay under the blood you say well how do I do that job had the great challenge of his life I'm I'm skipping a lot of things here but job had a great challenge of his life now if I can find this here where his friends would come and say you're a secret sinner you've done this you've done that but he he knew that he was righteous not because of his what he has done but because he stayed under the blood he had full confidence in the lamb that he offered that's how he stayed under the blood he didn't try and inject his own self into his salvation I know this is simple but Christianity simple we got to have full confidence in our lamp job did and God gave him a revelation of the Resurrection that he was part of it now I know my redeemer liveth he didn't understand what was going on in his life God didn't come before the time and say now Satan's going to come this is going to happen your friends are going to come they're going to say this this no he didn't say any of those things but job could stand staying under the blood because he had full confidence in that blood how about you we've had a lot of curve life is full of curveballs right but what do we do when we don't understand what's going on we stay under the blood by having full confidence in our lamb amen amen I was going to find a find a place to get off and then we can we can Rejoice a little bit you know we take things because some people don't like simplistic I'm not saying you don't but some people like complicated things I like simple things you say well you studied science and worked in science I like simple things I like simple things does it work yes good okay let's do it it's simple right now we believe in the power of the blood for the forgiveness of sin do we not we believe that our sins are not just covered by the blood of Jesus Christ they're gone right you got to realize the power of genuine confession brother Bram would have a uh brother Tim PR he um I don't know if um he has a sister in his church who was a young teenage girl there in brother Brown's meetings now I know I've shared this before but I just want to tell you the power of confession the power of this Blood she was in the prayer line teenage girl and and and her parents were in the audience there they came to church together she was in the prayer line she was secretly smoking and hiding it from her parents and then now I think two people in front of her a man standing before the prophet and the angel of the Lord of course is there and and God is Discerning through the prophet what's going on in his life he says you're a smoker and um and then so she hears this and then she starts panicking because she realizes when she stands in that presence nothing is hid from God nothing's hid from God and God's going to call out that she's smoking secretly lying to her parents about it and so she starts repenting in her heart she starts calling on God say God I'm sorry I'm wrong forgive me of the sin Lord then she stands in front of the Prophet there's no mention of it why because if if Sinners confess a genuine confession into the blood of Jesus Christ God don't see it God don't see it you may remember it but God don't see it amen so that's that is the power of this Blood a genuine confession well do I have to have tears do I have to scream I shout no what's your heart say what's the genuiness of your heart right when you sincerely say Lord forgive me for this I've done this it's dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ God don't see it no more amen God don't see it no more he don't remember it no more that is the power of this Blood of this lamb that we have now so if it if it is that powerful just for confession of sin then can it not keep the devil away see he may punch at you he may tempt you trial different things but can it not I know I'm repeating myself but I just want to emphasize this can it not protect you for your your worldly your Earthly Journey can I not protect your house can I not keep you from all the you know the devil's devices can it not can we not have full confidence that the blood is more than enough for us amen oh but I've got to be good I've got to do this no you just got to have full confidence in your lamb because when you do it'll change you not just the situ it'll change you amen praise the Lord let's just finish with this oh let's just go here you see because because that Death Angel could not come into a house where the blood was right so it's just like that that spiritual death that's riding the land now it may come to other people but there's something different in you is the strong man of the house and there's no one stronger than our God there's no one stronger than our God and he can't even be wrestled with by the devil and the devil can't even nearly get him no the devil's defeated now I'm not saying things flippantly I'm trying to tell you our God is far greater than any circumstance any enemy anything right but we got to stay sincerely and Passover rejoicing in the lamb trusting in our God more than anything amen so he says about the strong man if he you know everything saf but if a stronger man comes in and overcomes and then all all his armor and things he trusted is divided and he and he divideth the spoils right but our God is the strongest man so if he's on the inside if that token of the Holy Ghost is on the inside the devil can't get you amen but now what is what is the world looking for oh wait let's just go here now when God puts a seal upon a man and the seal is the Holy Ghost uh when his when he seals a man like that he's gone to his eternal destination no no one ever can he ever ever go back anymore cuz remember Ephesians 4:30 grieve you not the Holy Ghost of God whereby you're sealed uh for all times the time of your destination see you're sealed forever you are sealed eternally into the kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit now think of that then you the devil will punch at you he'll say everything to you and accuse you and try to make you think that you're not but don't you listen to them remember you were there when it happened amen amen we're just going to finish with this and the musicians can come now what the world is looking for just a moment is to see some display not of shouting that's all right I believe in that not of speaking in tongues now that's all right I believe in that it's in its place I believe in the whole Bible not some Mir of healing I believe in that every bit of it what the world is looking for is to see some real Christianity some real life that you live out on the street wherever you are sealed with the power of God with the glory of God not running down the street hollering hallelujah hallelujah that isn't it but a sweet humble Christian walk before men Living the Life acting like a Christian being like a Christian behaving yourself like a Christian that's what the world's wanting to see and people will go down the street and say if there ever was a Christian a sainted person there she goes or there he goes but you see what we've done you know it's the truth friend that's what the world's looking for well how do I say that stay in communion with your lamb stay in Passover amen because they sorry I know I've said one more but I just want to say this one more Moses tells the children of Israel to keep the Passover every year and then there'll come a time when that when your children shall say unto you why mean you by this service so in other words it should be questioned why do we live like this mom why do we live like this Dad this is really I mean to me this is what the children should be asking then you shall say it is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover amen who passed over the houses of of the children of Israel in Egypt when he smot the Egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshiped so there should be a question why are we this way well it's simple because we've got a lamb we've got the Lamb of God he's in our house this is why we live this way this is why we're Christians because his blood has been applied amen we're dressed ready to leave this world Amen and when that comes in you can say well I remember the time I was a slave amen I remember the time I was a slave those those task Masters were cruel those Egyptians were cruel those Spirits were cruel then God sent his word amen delivered me he says just get under the blood the death angel can't strike you you're safe and and daughters Sons daughters family I've been this way ever since this is why this is why there is this service amen praise the Lord let's uh let's have the musicians this morning um we're safe safe and secure in the rock of all ages just let the pressure off amen brother R says in one place if you could just see the guarantee of it of this token it make you feel so relaxed not LAX but relaxed why because it's a guarantee that this token of Holy Ghost is is sure it's true it's right amen it works praise the Lord let's let's stand this morning so we'll maybe pick it up another time but I trust we got more confidence than ever in the blood of our lamb of his life in our his life in our lives amen let's
