souvenirs coming home all the nice gifts and things so we can only pack so much but isn't it a beautiful thing this morning that there's no weight limit with God but no matter how full you are right now there's still a little bit more room God can pour out some more blessings this morning God can give you some more joy some more of him and that's our desire that's my desire amen more of God every day amen God bless you thank you musicians and we just want to give a special thanks to brother Ben and the church for all that they've done with this Camp amen amen hasn't it been beautiful all the labors of love all the food it's just I just thoroughly enjoyed myself and uh just so grateful for the opportunity that uh the Lord saw it fit for us to be here and and uh stand here with brother Burley and and how many's enjoyed brother burley's Ministry amen amen he's been through some battles he's been through some scars and uh and he's come through it as a soldier and as a hero and uh letting you know and that that you can overcome and that you can press through it and and I appreciate a real soul that'll stay with this message and amen we're just so thankful this morning if you have your Bibles and you could turn with us to the Book of Joshua I got a a few readings um but they're not long and you can be seated after that and uh we just want to take a little thought this morning out of Joshua um about stepping into the commission stepping into the commission and then uh we're going to uh take a couple scriptures here but Joshua 1 veres 1-9 a familiar passage and uh we could probably all all know it but we'll just refresh your memory after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake onto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people under the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel and every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even onto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life but as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee so be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest and this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth amen didn't say out of thy hands it says out of thy mouth it shall not depart but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest and you don't have to turn there I'm just going to read a couple quick scriptures out of Judges 6 and 14 it says and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee amen here's another excerpt where the Lord speaking to to Gideon have not I sent thee and and we just want to keep that in mind as we as we go through this thought and uh also in Psalms 42: 6-7 you don't have to turn there but very familiar it says oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the hermit from the hill Mazar deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me amen so we want to take a thought from that step into the commission it's for you and anden let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your grace father and an opportunity to Lord that you saw fit to give us another day to serve you Lord and you saw fit to gather us together in this place and Lord we don't believe it was an accident but we believe you arranged it father even before the foundation of the world Lord and Satan can't understand that father he can't understand that you can pre-arrange something father he can't understand the supernatural but father as your sons and daughters Lord we understand that you're a supernatural God and you've arranged moments father moments of Deliverance and moments of victory and father we believe we're living in a a pre-arranged moment this weekend father where you're coming down and touching hearts and you're touching lives and turning situations around and father we give you the glory for that for we know it's no man that could do it father but it's only you and we invite you to come in this service once more this morning Father that you take over the hearer and the speaker once more Lord and you just go down the aisles and go down the pews and just Lord minister to the hearts and needs of your people father Lord that my prayer this morning of that if there's one here father that feels like maybe they've missed an opportunity Lord that that feels like maybe that they're still under a burden father that Lord they don't want to go home the same they don't want to take it home father and Lord I've got no power of myself to take it from them but Lord you have the power father your word Lord has the authority to cast it off and father we come on the basis of your word Lord that Lord every son and daughter of God would be able to leave here free this morning amen we believe it and we thank you for it and we'll be sure to give you the glory in Jesus name amen you may have your seats this morning for a few moments and we want to take this thought on stepping into the commission and and and Joshua of course is a prime example of that because Joshua was following Moses Joshua wasn't the Forerunner Moses foran but Joshua was stepping into those tracks and uh uh you know I would say they were big shoes to feel for Joshua because Moses had the Lord had went with Moses the Lord had protected them the Lord had led him through battles and victories and great things and Joshua saw that and here he was now Moses is gone Moses my servant is dead and said what are you going to do Joshua you're going to have to step into those same tracks that Moses stood in and brother brandham said uh now only two left now that ever left the promised land Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new Comm or to lead an army to step into the place where a great man like Moses stood it was no little task he said I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood what a command what a commission but now he brings it down not just to the ministry but he says each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way amen so you're stepping into more than the pastor's tracks you're stepping into more than Mom and Dad's tracks but you're stepping into the very tracks that Jesus stood in and you're stepping into those shoes to stand under that same commission and live a life and live a holy life and live an overcoming life and operate under the commission that God's called us to amen it looked like he could have sent someone else you know there's been some some prophets Through the Ages that I'm I'm sure felt like they weren't fit for the job and it looked like God could have sent someone else you you know it looked like God uh Jonah would be a great example where it looked like God could have sent someone else uh and here God God God so pre-arranged it that he would send them in the the belly of a fish and he was sending them to a people who served a fish God and and it would God operates in such a Perfection and it looked like maybe there could have been a stronger man or a more a more military man that God could have sent but Jonah was the one ordained for the job and and if God's ordained you for the job that no one can take your place place no no one your neighbor can't take your place but God has commissioned you to step into that spot and only you can feel those shoes they've been molded to you they've been custom designed to you only you can step into those shoes amen and it's a powerful thing and it's also a a sobering thing and say Lord how am I going to do it but the beautiful thing is that he's not leaving it up to our ability but but when he spoke to Moses when God sent Moses he said Moses in the book of Exodus I'm come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land onto a good land in a large onto a land flowing with milk and honey onto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherein the Egyptians oppressed thee now at this point Moses is probably feeling pretty good he says well praise the Lord uh our people are going to be delivered uh the Lord's come down he's heard their Cry he's going to set them free at this point Moses is charged up he said this is this is going to be a miraculous thing we're going to stand here and witness great Deliverance to our great nation but then he says come now therefore Moses I'm going to send you onto Pharaoh he's like oh hold on that's a little different I I knew that there was prophecy that our people would be delivered I knew that it was coming and and you just told me how you're going to do it but you're sending me to do it how how could I ever do that how could I ever step into that commission how could I ever do anything to deliver these people but he said Moses I'm coming down but I'm sending you amen and Moses tried it one time in his own ability and it felled he fell flat on his face but one time he tried it and God was with him and brother it was a oneman army Invasion that went down and took over the land of Egypt because God was with them because he stepped into his Commission according to the word of the Lord amen and it was a great thing it was a marvelous thing and when God gets ready to fulfill the word he sends he's sending you to fulfill it he needs somebody he he don't need ability but he does need some prisoners as our brother Burley spoke about last night he said when he sent Jesus he said Jesus in John 20:21 then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you he said as the father has sent me so send I you and the father that sent him went with him and in him and when he sent when he sent us he went came with us and in us because God can only work through a perfect Channel and God is is looking to do a work in this hour God is looking to do a work in this age but he can only work through Perfection and so he couldn't send just anybody he couldn't just send just any church any denomination but he had to go and shed up perfect blood and put that perfect blood Upon A people and on the day of Pentecost he could send a power Upon A people that could receive an ability that he could operate through human beings because he's not operating through your stained flesh and through all your mistakes and all your shortcomings but he's put something on the inside of you brother and sister that he can operate through and he's operating through that channel and it's not your ability it's not your Humanity but it's the eternity that dwells inside of you the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's quickened your soul and God says I can work through that because it's not going to be your hands it's going to be your hands but it's not going to be your ability it's going to be your feet but it's not going to be your ability it's going to be your voice but it's got nothing to do with your ability but the god that sent you has gone in you and put a Perfection inside of you that he can work through you so you can throw down all the thought of human ability this morning it has nothing to do with it but it's a perfect strength being established through perfect weakness that God can work through a perfect people amen and we're living in it but you must have leadership to walk right to walk with the Lord you must walk under a leadership and there was a rich young ruler one day and we've all know the story and brother he turned down the leadership of God for the leadership of church and brother brand said when he come to the end of when he come to the end of the road he begin to scream brother Burley told the powerful story last last night at that sister he said you know he belonged to church and everything he was raised right he knew all the rules but when he come to the end of the road he said there's nowhere to step where's his leadership he had been led by his church which is dead amen but one day there was a man named Moses and Moses didn't just take the leadership of a church and mean he didn't just take the leadership of pharaoh but he took the leadership of a pillar of fire he accepted the leadership of God and when he came to the end of his Road he looked and laying there by his side brother brandom said was his leader The Rock and he stepped out on the Rock and the angels of God packed him away into glory and because Moses accepted leadership but when brother B said his name will be great when there's no more Egypt or Treasures when the pyramids are dust and Egypt is no more Egypt Moses will be immortal among men because he accepted the leadership of Christ instead of going the way the church went he accepted true leadership and he's still he's still mortal amongst men God has God Has Lifted him up because he accepted the true leadership but every man of God is commissioned to walk under the leadership of this word every man of God is commissioned to stay with this word Every Woman every daughter of God is commissioned to stay with this word and stay with the leadership of this message and stay with the rhythm of this word no matter which way the Rhythm goes if it's in the up or it's in the down you know that it's just the rhythm of the word it's just the great Symphony being orchestrated and you're just walking in it you're just a part of it no matter if you're going through the deep valleys brother BR said all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose so what is it it's just a part of the Rhythm and you're just walking in the Rhythm in the leadership of the Lord amen the thing about this commission is we're not just commissioned uh to to lay our hands on the sick and they shall recover we're not just commissioned to cast out Devils although we are are but but many could do that and brother Brandon would say you know many will come Accord the Bible told us that many will come to me in this day and say Lord have not I preached in your name and prophesied have not I done these great things have not I cast Devils off in your name and they'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never even knew you why is that because that's not the only commission to just cast out devils and pray for the sick but you're commissioned to stay with the word you're commissioned to stay with this message and you could could do all those things and and be living any kind of Life Judas could do those things Judas was under that commission but the difference was Judas never went to Pentecost and got the Seal of his commission he never went and got his papers he never went and got the confirmation of the commission I me because any of us can aspire to be a great Soldier and go down brother Brandon would say to the 10- cent store and get a nice little outfit and get a soldier uniform or a policeman uniform and you can go and you can have all the outward appear but if you don't have your papers that you're sent that you've been commissioned then no one will believe you but you must have your papers you must have the Seal of your commission the disciples he said I've commissioned you to do this but before you go go up to Pentecost and receive the confirmation and these signs shall follow you and I'll be with you even in you but you must go to Pentecost first and receive the confirmation of the commission and you got no right to call yourself a preacher or even a Christian unless you first come on those sacred SS and receive the confirmation of your commission the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and then it won't be the book of shakina fellowship and then it won't be the acts of brother Benner brother Burley but it will be the acts of the holy spirit inside of you writing another book of Acts writing another book of a of a people who have been sealed with this great Holy Ghost amen I think of that story uh where brother Brandon talks about the the wife walking in and the husband's reading the paper he said well is there anything new is there anything new on the news he said no it's just the same news only different people amen it's just the same depression only different only different people are doing it but the thing about it is brother if you get the same holy ghost that sell fell on the day of Pentecost I can look and say brother Burley uh what's the news looking like about the church today he said brother it's the same news that they had only it's through different people they're still Healing The Sick they're still casting out Devils they're still staying with my word only this time it's through a group of people that have rose up out of lead to se of Darkness now it's through brother Burley and brother B it's not through Paul and Peter anymore but it's through you and through me it's the same book being written another book of Acts written behind this church because oh youve received the same commission you've received the same holy spirit that they received and we're walking in it and we're living in it and we're in our commission amen but the question isn't if there's a commission but now we come down to where the rubber meets the road and the question is is it for me I know there's a commission I can read Mark 16 every day I I know but is it for me is it for me we know the days of Miracles aren't passed if if you study the message if you study the scriptures you know that the Great Commission is still in force today uh brother B said you know it was introduced on the day of Pentecost and it hasn't ceased and Pentecost begin without an ending we we know that there's still a commission for the church we're not just meant to sit here and and just have our feet up on the bench and doing nothing we know that there's still a commission that is not the question but it is if it's for you I mean you can say is the token for me is the commission for me and you can look at the Bible in Acts 2 and say the promise is onto you and to your children and and as many as the as a far off and as many as the Lord Our God shall call and and you can look to the word for your answer and begin to build faith and you can find your identity in this word you don't have to look to any man I don't have to discern you you can look to this word and say this is my answer he said the promises are onto as many as the Lord Our God has called he said blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and mean he didn't just leave you he already said you're blessed if you hunger he already said you're blessed if you thirst but he didn't just leave you there he said You shall be filled and so you can begin to draw strength from the word and say yeah maybe it is for me maybe it is for me after all maybe the Holy Ghost is for me me no matter how stooped you are in sin what you have done brother Brenham said that doesn't have one thing to do with it he said you apply the token it's for you if you feel in your heart there's something tugging it's for you you apply the token me you may have come in here this morning wondering even if you've sinned away your day of Grace maybe the devil's tried to put that in your mind that even you've sinned away the day of Grace but brother Brandon would say look do you have respect still for the Lord Jesus and if you do he said he hasn't left you he's still got Mercy for you and mean he would look and he said I see a real dark shadow following you too which is a devil he's almost tempted you to Suicide sometime telling that you had crossed the separating line that you wasn't never going to be saved is that right is that yes and then another another message he says Satan has desired to take your life he said you're all tore up you think you send away your day of Grace you think your life is ruined do you love Jesus what makes you love him yeah before there could be anything in there make you love him there has to be a Creator to create the love in your heart is that right if you send away your day of Grace you would hate Jesus but you love him and you're all right and the devil's just lying to you you're nervous come here and I'll cast him away from you if you'll believe do you believe it and he says almighty God be merciful to the boy he stands here and Satan is trying to get him in the condition to commit suicide but Thou Art here to relieve the boy and to make this evil spirit go and thou has said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out Devils then act upon the authority of God's word as a Believer I now ask the spirit that's on the boy of unbelief to leave him go out of the in the name of Jesus Christ and bother him no more and I set him free and may the enemy be bound and leave this room and torment no one else in Jesus Christ's name see what is it Satan is a liar and God's word is the truth and Satan is trying to get you in condition for suicide and Satan is trying to get you in condition for a hard life and Satan is trying to get you in condition for depression and fear but God sent us a word to get you in condition for who you were really meant to be God sent us a word and we stand here under a commission and take this word and speak it over your life and what are we doing we're getting you in the condition for Joy we're getting you in the condition for the promise we're getting you in the condition to say maybe it is for me maybe I can receive the Holy Ghost and we declare that word over your life it's for you it's for you it's for you and you can start confessing it is for me what are you doing you're getting in a different condition you're changing atmospheres from an atmosphere of fear to an atmosphere of Faith amen and God's calling you God's pulling you to this God's pulling you to this new birth amen God's pulling you to these things that you desire because it wasn't made or give to you by any goodness it was God's election and calling that brought you to it you never you never done nothing to Merit it amen you never saw after God God sought it after you and give it to you on the basis of Sovereign Grace Amen in a true hunger in a heart of a son and daughter of God will not leave you just joining Church true hunger will not leave you just just putting your name on a book true hunger will not just leave you in justification true hunger will not just leave you in sanctification but true hunger will take you all the way to Pentecost to receive the same holy ghost that was poured out in the book of Acts true hunger will take you to a reality true h will not leave you short but it says I've got to have it I've got to have a reality I've got to have what my pastor has I've got to had what they had in the Bible I'm not satisfied with anything less I'm not satisfied with the Creed but true hunger is taking you all the way to the reality predestin to search for predestinated to stay in the wilderness but you were predestinated to cross over into every promise into every blessing amen and never let the devil talk to you out of it because there's a deep calling onto the deep and if it's calling you know there's a deep to respond you may not even have a scripture you may you may have walked in here this morning and you can't even find the book of James but there's something in your heart that says There Is A Healer that you may not be able to find the book of Isaiah where it said uh you know by his stripes I am healed you may not even be able to find the promise of the Holy Ghost in the Bible but it's still a deep calling in to the deep there's still something in you that says there must be a Healer because I'm hungering for it I'm Desiring for it I've got a need for it because there's a deep calling to the Deep so there must be a deep to respond even if you don't even know where it's at in the Bible God knows and he's put a creative something in The Believer to press for that and pull for that because there's something in you connecting life connects with life life begins to connect with life and if there's a life in you this morning no matter how deep it's buried in the muck of sin when the Word of Life Starts to come forth the life in you starts con to connect with the life of this word and it begins to pull you out of that muck and pull you out of that sin and bring you up to the surface so you can see the light of day who you really are where you really came from what you've really been sent here to do and it'll begin to let you know it's for you it's for you it's a pulsation in you and me it's more than a custom so what do you do well there's two elements that control there's fear and there's Faith two elements and brother brand said a spirit anoints them now they may seem a little strange to a person that doesn't believe this way see if they are unbelieving it's the spirit of the devil anointing that person it's pulling right down it's pulling down and like that with disbelief you see and I can feel that and tell it brother brandom said yes sir and it makes it hard but he said when a person is really believing they're pulling in the spirit of God see cuz it's the word of God we all know that and if the devil can just put a question mark across there he's got you but when you erase that question mark and say that's every bit bit true and it's for me then you're pulling from God Amen you may have come in here pulling one way but you don't have to stay that way the only thing you can do is right now you have the authority to change your confession and say brother it's every bit true and it's for me and you can stop pulling in unbelief you feel like you're you're getting hold into that Darkness but in a moment right now under that authority of this commission you can change your confession and say brother it's every bit true and it's for me it's every bit true every promise is true and it's for me and I'm tired of that devil of fear holding me down in this muck of sin in this Darkness I'm tired of that devil holding me down so what do you do just turn to your neighbor and say it's for me say I'm changing my confession this morning it's for me I'm ready to walk in the blessings of God I you don't have to understand it it's not for you to understand all you have to do is believe it and start walking in it this morning right now under that Authority you can change and start walking in Fresh Light amen it's the devil it's Satan anyway that's trying to stop you he said well I shot the Holy Ghost and I just couldn't receive it I don't believe it's for me every time I get down I get sick and I go to praying if I fast I get sick if I try to stay all night I stay and get so sleepy I can't get off my feet remember that's the devil because God God intends for you to have the Holy Spirit many times you find when you're prayed for in a meeting Divine Healing the next day you find out no doubt the devil will try to make you worse and mean maybe some of you've been prayed for last night or the night before and the situation got worse and you think well maybe something's wrong no it's not that something's wrong he said it's just Satan trying to get you away from the blessing that God's got for you see don't you listen to that always press right on always press right through that that's the moment that that's the test right there and there's a test right there there is when when you've been prayed for for your healing for your deliverance and all of a sudden you begin to feel that little bit of oddness come back and and and sometimes I mean let's just this is we're all humans here sometimes you try to fight that with your own ability and say try to keep the bad thoughts from coming try try to keep them from coming uh uh I feel good right now and and I'm just so worried that it's going to come back I'm just so worried and you begin to and you begin to just begin to get yourself in such a worked up confusion in a worry but but it's just the devil trying to stop the visitation it's just the devil but you don't have to accept it you don't have to walk in it but you can say no devil I've come upon the basis of the word I've been come upon the promise I didn't come upon my feelings and there's got to come a time in your life and that time needs to be right now where you separate your feelings from your faith it's not about your feelings but it's about your faith in the commission and if you came for healing the Bible said by Stripes you are healed you don't have to walk in any any longer no matter how you feel no matter what the devil tells you you can walk out of it this morning because you're coming upon the basis of the infallible word for your deliverance for every promise you can walk out because you're not trusting in your feelings or your ability but you're trusting in the ever ever everpresent Promises of this Bible amen but Satan always tries to do that uh before I mean it's almost funny how how predictable he can be sometimes and man before this camp meeting you know all kinds of things are going to happen because Satan is trying to block the oncoming visitation and Satan always does that he did that to Abraham and Sarah when there was coming a visitation that they were going to have a son Satan tried to block it and brother Brandon would would tell about that many times and if you want to listen to it I encourage you is there anything too hard for the Lord Brother brandham lays us down real heavy in the first 15 minutes he says many times when we see disastrous things happening like that especially to Believers we must bear this in our mind that it's Satan trying to block the blessing that's on the road amen and he says down he skips down he says Satan's been after me all day so I just believe that there's a blessing in store here in this city somewhere and I know when he tempts me and tries to block me out what's he trying to do he's trying to get you to disbelieve he said the worst thing that you can do is disbelieve God and as soon as you get a little scar shared well maybe I haven't done this and maybe I haven't done that right then Satan's got that blessing conquered for you and me and you can't get to it as long as Satan makes you think that amen so what do you do in that moment you think maybe that's because something's wrong you maybe think maybe think maybe I didn't have enough faith maybe when I got prayed for I uh something was wrong and and all of a sudden and automatically that that blessing begins to slip away because that's what Satan wants you to do is change your confession to the negative but if you've come upon the word you can stand there and say no Satan's just trying to block my visitation so I'm not going to turn to that but I'm just going to look even more to the promise because I know it's promised me and I know that there's a blessing that must lay just beyond that press just beyond that battle there lays a blessing for you amen when brother Brandon went out one time praying in the woods and the thistles were all around them and the mosquitoes were buzzing around them and and and and and many times that's hard and we all know some times that's hard to get down and pray and your mind is going every which way except what you should be thinking about but brother brandham stayed there and begin to pray there and that's when the Lord dealt with him to go by the way of Carter's and Georgie Carter received her healing because brother Bram didn't just didn't just look at the circumstances but he pressed through that barrier and there was a victory that lay right on the other side of that barrier there was a Deliverance that lay right on the other side of that press so you can press through it this morning you may still Maybe maybe you're still feeling Darkness maybe you were prayed for last night but but this morning the devil's taunting your mind don't stop don't turn around press through the darkness press to the victory press to your healing press to your deliverance it's on the way anyhow if the word promised it it's on the way just keep rejoicing just say thank you Lord for the promise thank you Lord for the healing thank you for the Deliverance amen it's settled it's settled already what do you do you got to let the word be become your word brother brandom said you got to let the word become your word say well I believe God can heal but I just don't know stand up and let the word become your word believe it don't reason it just believe it it's the word brother and if the word can find a place it can turn if the word can find a place in your heart I don't care the situation you don't have to tell me we don't have to sit down for 20 minutes and talk about your situation if the word can just find a place it can turn it no matter how dark it is no matter how deep it is no matter how much sin that you've come under if the word can just find a place it can turn that so what do you do you got to let the word become your word you got to let the word become personal to you and say it's not just a promise of healing it's my promise of healing it's not just a promise of Deliverance it's my promise of Deliverance it's my promise of the Holy Ghost it's my promise and let the word become your word amen and and no matter how dark the situation is am me we you can you can tell me you can tell me but there's nothing I could do about it in my human ability we could talk about how dark it is but I can tell you that there is a word that you can receive that can turn that situation around and change it for the glory of God what do you do brother Isaac what do I do you got to act on the commission we've been given a commission but you got to act on it what did Noah do for 120 years he walked out and he started building that Ark he just started banging Nails he started following the Commandments of the Lord there wasn't rain coming for you know 20 years and and all this time but he the whole time what it was he doing he was acting on the commission he just started acting he said Lord you told me I'm just going to act I'm just going to keep working on this Arc though they make fun of me though they tell me uh I'm some sort of of of just fanatic for doing this I'm going to act on the commission amen Moses acted on the commission you know the devil tried to tell him Pharaoh's been looking for you for 40 years as soon as you walk in that City he's going to have you killed but Moses said I don't know all I know is the Lord's with me he said he sent me I've got my staff in my hand I'm acting on my commission this morning I don't understand it all but I'm just going to act on it I'm just going to walk in it I'm just going to believe for it amen you know the Bible commissioned us to go into all the world and preach the gospel amen but brother Burley you could read that every day of your life but a few days ago you had a get up off the chair walk to that plane and get on and fly 20 hours across the world to be here what that takes an action that takes a stepping out to say Lord you told us to do it you gave us this commission but I got to act on it and me that's a that's an example but you can do that this morning for every promise for every Redemptive blessing for your healing what do you do you were prayed for the devil's come and whispered in your ear that that you didn't receive it you don't take that lie but you start acting on the commission and say Lord no your word said I was healed your word said I was delivered your word said by your stripes and that's greater than the feelings that I have this morning and mean if you desire the Holy Ghost those disciples went up into that upper room and for nine days they acted on the commission they just started acting said Lord you told us that we could have it and and what were they acting on it wasn't just acting on some figment of their imagination but they had a Word of Promise that they were acting on you see they had read in Isaiah 28:19 about PRI prep must be upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little hold fast to that what's good for with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest that I said they should see in Joel 2:28 it said it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out in my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and upon my handmaids and Maid servants will I pour out my spirit and what was it what were they doing they had a Word of Promise and they were acting on it for for n days and and it wasn't just say well maybe we've received it it's not that it's not just to say well they you know brother B said what if they would have said well maybe we've received it at at five days or six days but no they had to stay until but the whole time they were acting upon the word but but you're living in a different phase this morning brother and sister because brother Brandon said you know in this day we don't have to T and T and T there's no such a thing but while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon him and you don't have to T this morning for days and days but right now you can make up your mind and say Lord you promised it to me I'm going to act on it you say when can I start acting brother Isaac right now you can start acting and say Lord thank you for the Holy Ghost Lord thank you for the promise Lord I know it's for me I'm tired of that devil and it's for me and Lord I Thank you for the promise thank you Lord for the Holy Ghost and you don't know maybe in just a couple minutes all of a sudden something come over your life and transform you and change the situation around you can have your healing when can I have it brother Isaac right now you can have your healing right now you can have your deliverance right now you can receive the Holy Ghost just start acting on it just start saying Lord I Thank you for the promise Lord thank you for my prodigals coming home thank you for my family thank you for my children thank you for the healing thank you for everything Lord that you promised me in your word I thank you for it I give you glory for it Lord for it's mine and it's settled and I don't have to live with it one moment longer and me start acting and and if you act ACT first you'll see a miracle but what you got to do you got to act first and then you'll see a miracle you start acting and by the end of this meeting you could be walking out of you're a completely different person a completely different young person transformed by the power of God what did he speak to Peter he said Lord when Peter walked out on the water he said Lord if that be you bid me come and he said come that's the hard part right there sometimes you pray and you really don't want to hear an answer you say Lord if if you do this I I'll serve you Lord if you do this I'll serve you and then he doesn't you're like wait a second it wasn't supposed to be that easy I'm not so sure if I if I'm ready to serve you I'm not so sure but there's got to come a time where you stop saying Lord if that's you Lord if that's you Lord if that's you B me come Lord if that's you I'll serve you Lord if that's you I'll know it's for me but all of a sudden the word came forth come and Peter stepped out on the water and there's got to come a time where you start acting and where you start stepping out on the water and me and brother brandom said come on he said that's just the same as James 514 in Mark 16 the same God that said it said come on we're not waiting to hear him say come this morning we're not waiting for anything he's already spoke to you through this word come into the water and the waters are good there's victory in the water there's healing in the water there's Deliverance in the water you just got to step out into it and the waters are stirred this morning by the preaching of the word the waters begin to stir this message has enough power to turn you around but you got to step out in the Water by faith and say Lord I'm going to start acting on it because you promised it am man this is where the rubber meets the road this is what you can take with you young people when you go back to school and when you go back to work amen this is the overcoming power upon the basis of this word and I think one of the most powerful examples of that of acting on the commission was John Ryan amen when he came in he came in blind as could be he came in and he started saying Lord I I got a need for healing and he went up for prayer and he said you know uh brother you know brother brandom heal me you know take this from me he said I can't do that he said well will you will you at least pray for me he said yeah and begin to pray for him and say you know you're going to be healed you're going to be healed John Ryan you're going to be healed just go forth you're going to be healed and so John Ryan starts walking off the platform and and he goes and he comes back and say I thought you told me I was going to be healed and brother BR say well I I that has nothing to do with it John Ryan uh you are healed he he already said you're healed that's got nothing to do with it and by the way you told me you believed anyhow you told me you were a Believer so why don't you start acting like you believe why don't you start acting like you're healed and so John Ryan did he walked out and said you know extra extra read all about it I'm Healed I'm Healed extra extra read all about it and he started acting upon that promise and he started walking out and one day he was sitting in a barber chair brother B and he said praise God I'm Healed praise God I'm Healed and his eyes became open he said wow now I am healed now it's finished now I can have my sight now it's over now it's already settled now I can walk forth oh I'm no longer acting now I'm rejoicing in it because it's settled and you can Rejoice before it's even settled you can Rejoice before your eyes are ever open because it was already settled in the word and you can rejoice in it amen you're not lying you're not lying you're acting you're not lying if you tell someone you're healed you're acting there's a sister one time brother Wayne tells about her name her name was Dena Nelson and they were down there in Arkansas preaching the meeting and she came up she had had a stroke and she said you know I want prayer you know I want I want prayer for my healing and brother brother Wayne laid his hands on her and prayed for her and he said go you know go confess your healing and so they come back to church that night and she said she you know he preached the word and she began to walk up towards that her again he said my hey she must be coming back for prayer again but all of a sudden she said brother Wayne I want to testify and you know what she did she took that arm that used to be crippled and when she reached out for that microphone her crippled arm reached out and grabbed that microphone her crippled leg reached out and she started dancing around that building because what she was she doing she was acting on her commission and she went from a crippled woman to a hill woman in a matter of moments because she just acted she didn't work through it she didn't press through it she just acted upon the faith of the word she just acted upon the promise and she began to walk and she began to dance a victory dance because it was no longer uh the identity of a crippled woman but she said I'm Healed I'm Healed there it is change your confession your identity isn't crippled this morning your identity isn't depression this morning your identity isn't anxiety this morning change that confession you've got to change it to this word and say Lord by your stripes I'm Healed Lord I don't care about the crippled arm by your stripes I'm healed amen we've had a soldier doing that all weekend he's got the trouble in his eyes but what's he doing Lord by your stripes I'm Healed he's not lying to you he's acting he's acting on his commission he's acting on the word and I believe the word will bring to pass the promise for his healing amen now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I'm saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all of my heart let your testimony always in your thoughts never let a negative thought come into your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it where you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could stop them from roosting he's the high priest of your confession and it'll work for every Redemptive blessing but brother brandom said you confess what you confess you are that's what you are amen and any man will never live any farther or any higher than what he believes he's living amen it's not mind over matter friends but it's not your thought to begin with you're accepting something into your mind but it's not it has nothing to do with your thought but it's the just a nesting place for the word to come in and that if that word can find a place in your mind and begin to confess it and at the confession of your mouth that that word begins to drop into your heart and bring to pass the promise and it's not mind over matter but the mind accepts it and you can choose to accept either what God Said or what the devil said this morning you can accept what the devil says or you can accept What God Says and and that'll determine what spirit is in there and if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything of the world but if you start confessing it and you start accepting it you can start walking in it brother and sister and if you start walking in the vision eventually you're going to be walking in the Fulfillment you say I I don't see Visions brother Isaac I I'm not spiritual that way that is nothing to do with it brother B said every time you open this Bible you see a vision and if you can take that vision and start walking in it brother one of these days you're going to be walking in the Fulfillment amen God gives Visions I I love them and I thank you I thank the Lord for them they mean so much to me but but but that has nothing to do with you if God hasn't given you a vision you still have one by the word and the word is your vision and you can start walking in that vision and you can start taking that promise and one of these days if you just keep walking in it you're going to walk in the Fulfillment one of these days if you take a promise for your prodigals and you believe with all your heart one of these days you might be sitting in your recliner and you're reading about Lord that that prodical son that came home and that door opens and they walk into the building what is it you walk in the vision you'll walk in the Fulfillment you walk in the vision for your healing you'll walk in the Fulfillment but you got to start somewhere you got to start walking you got to come back to the foundation of the word and say Lord I don't care what any other voice says I'm going to walk in the vision and man don't you think it was a little hard maybe for Abraham when God promised him Isaac and maybe ishmail come along don't you think there was some critics but Abraham had a vision for a son that would carry forth his seed and when Ishmael come along he wasn't phased at all but he said Isaac is coming I don't care what the critics say but my Isaac is coming amen that's what you got to do you see brother Brandon was promised a son he said you'll call his name Joseph and when the first girl came along they said Oh Brother brandom you know you messed up now is it you sure it wasn't Joseph Josephine you sure it wasn't Josephine he said no it was Joseph and I'm not going to worry about the critics I'm going to walk in the vision until my Joseph comes I'm going to walk in the promise until my Joseph comes and one of these days I'm going to walk in the Fulfillment because God promised me a son amen you're learning how to walk according to the word and don't settle for anything else and in this book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according all that is written for therein for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous then shalt thou have good success you're standing upon the word it shall not depart out of thy mouth you're standing on it is written it is written it is written it is written and you can take that it is written and brother you can stand toe to- Toe with any devil you can stand Toe to Toe and say it's my right it's my promise it's my family there's got to come a time where you stand brother and sister there's got to come a time where you stand up to that devil and say no this is my promise prise this is my victory and you can stand Toe to Toe with that devil this morning I like what brother Wayne said he said well how why I wonder why it was Toe to Toe because brother there's a lot of tall Giants in this land there's a lot of tall Giants in this Canaan land and I can't stand eye to eye with every giant but I can stand Toe to Toe with any Giant and say you are defeated according to the word and you have no right in my family I'm going to stand toe to- Toe with every depression and every anxiety and I'll stand with you this morning you young people you're facing some battles I'm standing with you this morning toe to- Toe with that devil and say he has no right over your mind he has no right over your over your thoughts when you lay down at night he has no right to torment your mind you're a daughter of god sister you're a Son of God and you have a right to press through that Darkness you don't have to live with that spirit that would try to tell you these lies that you're never going to make it but there's another spirit in the building today that is declared to you according to the word that you're free that you can walk out of the prison that you can walk out this morning and you can walk into full Victory you can walk into full blessing you can walk out why why why do I do that because I've been commissioned according to this Bible to preach this word not just in letter only but in power and demonstration and even Jesus himself preached to them deliverance and the opening to Door the opening of the door to them that are in prison that's right amen and what are we doing this weekend what's brother Burley been doing what have we been doing when we say the doors are open and you can walk out we're not just doing that just to pump you up we're not just doing that because we feel good and it makes us feel good we're doing that according to a commission and we're standing here and letting you know that you have a right to your deliverance you have a right to walk out of the prison this morning I'm here to declare to you according to the commission of this word that the doors are open and you can walk out of the prison and walk into your Victory anden you don't have to live with that devil anymore but you can walk into your Victory this morning it's a commission it's an absolute commission and no devil can talk me out of it no no no no no no no dried up teacher can talk me out of my commission because I met God in the sacred Sands and I've come under a commission say Lord your word will set them free your word will deliver them your word has the power to loose the spirit from their minds we're not looking for tomorrow we're not looking just to the end of the service but right now under the authority of the word you have a right to come out of that prison you have a right to throw it down and change garments to a new walk to a new life amen you got to stand you got to stand against that devil Joshua pressed through and on Joshua's Journey he went by Esau's Mountain how many know that in Deuteronomy 2:5 it says meddle not with them for I will not give you of their land and no not so much as a foot breath because I have given Mount siir onto Esau for a possession and when they passed by it Joshua had to keep his men from fighting with Esau's mountain with the men on Esau's Mountain Joshua's group said we're headed towards Jacob's mountain and Jacob's mountain is on the other side of the river and we're going to pass by Mountain and the problem was Joshua's Men had already tasted of blood so they were ready man hey let's fight these people man this is this is we're we're Overcomers we're going to fight these people but brother Bram said if you're not careful you try to do that you'll pick up their habits you try to stop by Esau's mountain and brother BR said you'll pick up their habits because there's some people that maybe you go to school with and and you go to work with and and and we trust that that that everyone is seed but there's some people that are living on Esau's mountain and brother BR said if they were predestinated to join up with you they would have but some not everyone's going to join up with this message friends not everyone's going to join up with this message so what you got to do is don't turn to the right or turn to the left and when those friends try to come and persuade you differently you're under a different commission you're headed to a different Mountain friends you're headed to a Rapture you're headed to to the Holy Ghost Land across cross the Jordan you're not supposed to stop short you're not supposed to stop and turn to those things but you got to press through that and why do you press through that friends because there's a deep calling to the deep and mean he said if that's enough for them that's fine if if they want to live on Esau's Mountain that's fine if they want to live just under a Halfway Christian Life that's fine but brother Brandon would say but if there's a deep calling to the Deep then there's you know that there's more for you you know that there's another Mountain for you you don't have to live on that mountain you don't to stop there brother BM said sheep hurting isn't enough for you you know just going just to just going to a denominational Church brother Ben wasn't enough for you why was it because there was a deep calling onto the deep in your heart that said give me my Mountain give me my Holy Ghost give me my Rapture give me my message and you press through every darkness and you press through you don't turn to the right or to the left you got to walk by Esau's mountain and walk to your Mountain but Joshua didn't stop stop because Joshua had already tasted of the land he said friends if all of you want to stop I that's up to you but as for me and my house we're going across why because Joshua had already seen it he said I don't know about you uh milk and honey may not be your taste but it's mine milk and honey may not be what you desire but it's what I desire and and and healing may not be for you but healing is for me I mean the Holy Ghost may not be for everyone but it is for me the message may not be for for everyone but it is for me mean heartfelt religion brother and sister may not be for everyone but it is for me amen and you can make up your mind but as for me in my house this message is for me this word is for me this Holy Ghost is for me and it's for my family and it's for my children and we're pressing into the land what are we doing we're overcoming Joshua was commissioned to stay with Moses's message no matter what Dayan and Kora said no matter what the critics said they could say Hey Brother Moses did you know Moses he takes too much on himself you know Moses sometimes he gets a little puffed up he thinks that his word is the only word he he thinks that his message is the only message and and and I think and this is just my opinion and well except I posted it on the internet and I posted on Facebook but but I think that that he takes too much upon himself and and that really really we should have more men because one opinion one opinion really really that's not good we need a few opinions we need to we need to work our our minds together to really get a balanced truth and and brother if you hear the that's the voice of Satan that's the voice of daythan and cor that try to come in and tell you that this message isn't really an absolute this this message isn't really it was a good it was brother Brandon's opinion and it's good for reference material but but but but I like to I like to hear little Dr Dobson as well and I I like i' like to hear a little good A little good teaching from the Charismatic Church down the road as well that's the voice of Satan in your ear sister that's the voice of Dayan and Kora which is a Satan voice that tries to get into your mind and tell you that this message is an absolute but Joshua was under a different commission amen and I'll Stand in the commission that Joshua stood and said I will not turn to the right or to the left but I will stay with Moses's words Moses's message is good enough and I'm under a commission this morning to just say what those tapes say don't add one word don't take one word stay with this message stay with what the tapes say you're under a different commission this message is an absolute over your life over every other opinion over every other answer this message is the answer we've been commissioned absolutely commissioned brother Bram said if you can read in that scripture something that Christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because of some twisting around if someone would tell you that was for the disciples or someone else and then you you don't hold on to that then Christ is not your absolute that person who led you out of the way is your absolute but if that word Christ if that word Christ still holds then he is your absolute that is the absolute if you you got to look in this word friends and see what does this word say and then that is your absolute if this word commissions you to baptize in the name of the of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is your absolute if this word commissions you to lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover that is the absolute and no teacher can take you out of the way but you got to come out and operate under your commission amen this is overcoming this is overcoming here amen we got to what does friends that's why you know that's why we stepped away anyhow you know brother brandom said he had to leave the Baptist Church to worship God he had to leave the B Baptist Church to worship and power and demonstration he had to leave the Baptist Church to really to really Worship the Lord to really preach this word he had to leave the church he had to leave every denomination and that's why we came out we didn't come out just to stay with the chains we didn't come out just to bring our chains across the boat like the pilgrims when they came to America they came out for Religious Freedom and and when you came to this message you came for freedom and you didn't come to bring your old change across the boat and say oh I know I sit in a message Pew but but I still think that that God that God doesn't deserve to be worshiped in spirit and truth I still think that that all the things brother brandham said weren't true but that's why we came out friends we came out for Freedom we came out for Liberty we came to this message for our freedom for our freedom for our children to be Lord filled with the Holy Ghost for the freedom for our children to overcome we came out for Freedom don't bring your chains over on the boat don't bring your denominational chains into this message they have no place here this is a place of Freedom this is a Heritage for our children this is the place where we can rest this is the place where we can find shelter this is the place where you can destroy every box that every denomination has ever put God in and say Lord I'm not going to put you in a box but I'm going to destroy my box this morning every time I've limited you every time I've told you that you couldn't operate a certain way Lord I've come under this message and this message declares unto me that you're God and that I can overcome and that I don't have to live with limits on this word but you can enjoy every promise amen you can enjoy every Victory you say well if I preach like that brother Isaac half the churches will kick me out let them let them why because brother Ben what have you found out somewhere in that other half there's going to be somebody to receive it somewhere in that other half there's going to be a Rahab somewhere that says I'll receive my token I'll receive my message somewhere in that other half there's going to be David that says I'm tired of this uncircumcised Philistine and all I need is one good preacher to come in here and tell me the truth and I'm ready to fight that devil I'm tired of them I'm tired of that depression I'm tired of that uncircumcised Philistine you were here all you needed to do is hear the word and it fell on good ground and you said Oh Glory to God I'm tired of that uncircum eyes Philistine I'm tired of that Goliath and I'm ready to cut off his head and father if there's a real father in here that'll just do that then what's going to happen your whole family will see you and they'll come behind you and they'll start cutting off Philistines head as well the Goliath will start falling all around this building you got to start with somebody if you want Revival say Lord start with me I'm going to slay my Goliath this morning I'm going to start with me and then my children are going to start following me my wife will follow me because somebody's got to step in and say Lord I'm tired of that Philistine you got to come to a place you say I'm tired of it you got to get to a place and say Lord I don't I don't have to take that beating anymore you got to get to that place friends where you realize who you are you realize the commission you're in and you say I don't have to take the beating anymore I I I've took it for years for years I've let the devil tell me I'm not going to make it for years I've let the devil tell me that it's not for me but I've really realized under the authority of the word this morning that I don't have to take the beating I don't have to walk in that anymore I can walk out free this morning you don't have to let the devil be up your mind you don't have to let that devil tell you young person that you're not going to make it anymore you can step out and that commission say Lord you've spoke better things over me you spoke Rapture over me you spoke victory over my life and mean you don't have to stay in that battle amen why he was the son has made free shall be free indeed There Was An Old Crow one time and that old crow got up in a crow trap and and he would walk around in circles and he would walk around and he' began to wither away and he began to wither and wither and wither and what was happening he was in a trap but one day a good man came by a good man came by and and took that little chain and took it off of his leg that he could walk free but what was the problem he had walked in prison so long that when that good man came by and told him that you can go free he said I've heard that before there's been preachers told me that before uh there's been there's been there's been pastors tell me that before that I could go free and you just keep walking in circles because you're so used to being in bondage you're so used to living with that devil that when I come this morning and brother berley comes and tell you you can go free you say h that's not the truth that's just the preacher's voice that's just that's just I've heard that so many times but there's got to come a time where you you you realize that it's not something that you have to live with but you've lived in it so long that you think that you can't get out you've lived in it so long that you think that that's going to be the end of your life you've lived in it so long that you think you'll never rise above it but the good men of the word has come this morning and let you know that you're free all you have to do is walk out the truth has made you free and he which is free is free indeed and you're free indeed this morning you're free indeed to serve the Lord you're free indeed to walk out of that this morning the word has declared you free free to worship free to dance free to Worship the Lord why do I worship the Lord because I'm under a commission this morning praise him in the dance praise him in on the timberl praise him on the stringed instruments I'm not just doing it because it makes me feel good sometimes it does but sometimes I drag into church and I may not feel like worshiping but that doesn't change my commission I'm still commissioned to praise the Lord I'm still commissioned to worship I say Lord I don't feel very healed today but Lord your word said it and I'm going to walk in your commission I'm commissioned to praise him I'm commissioned to thank him I'm commissioned to say Lord You're the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and you've healed me and you've saved me Lord you promised me my children Lord I don't feel like it that has nothing to do with it you're commissioned this morning to praise him praise him on the instruments Praise Him in the dance that everything that have breath praise the Lord amen and as long as you're not dead this morning then you're commissioned to praise him as long as you're not laying here dead then you have no excuse but to step into your commission and say Lord I'm going to praise you Lord I'm going to worship you because you saved me because you're my God not because I feel like it but because Lord you're worthy because you've called me out of this world and you've declared me I'm free indeed I'm free I'm free you're an eagle you're an eagle you can rise out of it you're an eagle you're helpless when you were caged up you were helpless when when the devil put you in a cage you were helpless and the only hope you has you have is if someone comes by and opens the cage to let you out and brother BR said God did that in calling you when God called you he opened the cage to let you out and when this word begins to call your name this morning I'm telling you that the cage is open that moment was the opening of the cage when that word begin to call your name and said wow I don't have to live with that that's the moment God opened that cage and you can walk out this morning but what are you going to do are you going to stay on the ground are you going to fly like the eagle that you were meant to be are you going to stay in that depression and say Lord I'm out of the cage but Lord I'm not ready to give it up no you have a right this morning to rise into the heavenlies and say Lord I I want to operate in the way that you called me to operate I want to be what you've called me to be you're not a slave anymore brother BR said see the day of sin is over brother I tell every every one of you I I tell every one of you serving sin tape or visible audience I'm glad he said that amen because that includes me he said tape or visible audience everyone that's serving sin the day of sin is over he who the son has made free is free indeed if you want to go free and be free in the sun Cut Loose from all things and serve them come on he said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free you come in this morning and you come in with a lot of lies that the devil told you he told you maybe sister that it wasn't for you maybe he told you that you're always going to live with that little fear that little complex that you're never going to be a real Christian you come in maybe under that lie but when the truth comes the truth sets you free and if you come in sick and and the truth comes that says by a stri Stripes I am healed then at that moment the truth has set you free the lie no longer has anything to do with it the truth has set you free if the word says you can walk out of that cage this morning that's the truth and that lie has no power anymore but the truth has set you free if the Bible says that if the Bible says that you haven't send away your day of Grace you may have come in thinking that you have but the truth has set you free it's the truth that sets you free it's the truth that sets you free from that prison the LIE has put you in a prison but when the truth comes the truth has set you free isn't that right brother when the truth comes the truth opens the gate and you can walk out amen and and you can you can come out of that CH out of that prison tonight brother brandham dealt with people he dealt with spirits and he he dealt with conditions and he could look at a lady and the lady had one time there was a lady that had a menopause and she had had people tell her that she had had Seven Devils on her and and one told her she had five Devils on her and one told her she had four Devils on her and she had people tell her you got Devils on her but when she come to a prophet the Lord could give him a vision of the situation and realized that she was just in a time of life and she was just in a time of menopause and all it was was the devil was making her nervous amen maybe the Lord's speaking to you right now don't turn it down maybe the Lord's telling you something here maybe you come into maybe you've come in here tonight and maybe you've been nervous and and maybe you've come in under this oppression and me and you come in and hearing this story of of this sister brother Brandon would begin to tell her that that that you're not you've got no need to be nervous sister you're just in a time of life you're not you're not you're not really bound up with these Devils someone's told a lie on you and and she got to where she could hardly eat her food because she said I'm not going to eat until until I get these Devils off of me but the prophet could come in and tell her that that you don't have Devils on you sister you're just in a you're just in a season you're just in a phase of life and it's just the devil trying to get in during that phase during that weak spot and tear you down and and and so brother Brandon began to discern and say it's not that you're possessed with the spirit it's just that it's just that you're in a phase of life amen and brother Brandon would tell about another man and he would say this man came and this man came and he was a car salesman and he came one day and he went to this trash can and he picked out a flyer where will you go when you die and he said my I need to figure this out where will I go when I die what will I do when I die and he began to read this pamphlet and he be to think my and his heart began to get stirred so what did he do he went to the Methodist and and he went to the Baptist and and you know he went he went and and and he went maybe to Oral Roberts and brother BR say he went to these places and one told him you have to shout and you got it and said brother brandom I shouted and I still don't have it he went to one and they said you have to speak in tongues and you have it and so he said brother brandom I spoke in tongues and I still don't have it what's wrong oh what's wrong I'm living under This Cloud I got to have it I got to know where I go when I die brother Brandon just took him and began to walk him through the scriptures and begin to tell him brother brother tell me your story where did you come from here you were going along you you weren't interested in God at all here you were going along just selling cars happy as can be but one day you picked up a pamphlet out of the trash can and all of a sudden you started going after God all of a sudden you started serving God he said what was it he said that was your conversion right there and he to rejoice and he began to dance say brother brandom you mean I've had it all along he said yes the word settled that you've had it all along he said good thing I had a prophet to tell me he said you didn't need a prophet he said the word settled that you've had it all along what am I trying to tell you what am I trying to tell you brother brandham said to the soldier boy we all know the story of the soldier boy here when brother bram's calling him out he says what's the matter soldier boy you're not going to commit suicide the devil's lying to you boy you've only got a phobia he's lying to you hold drive you insane if you believe him deny him renounce the devil I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to renounce the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer you'll go back and be a gentleman and a real real man do you do it raise up your hands to God and say praise God that's right oh amen now you go home and be well what am I trying to say is that sometimes you may just be a good Christian boy sometimes there's real good Christian girls and real good Christian Mamas and real good Christian dadas but the de the devil tells a lie on you and you enter into a dark you enter into a dark cloud because the devil told a lie on you and he told a lie on you and told you you're never going to make it he told a lie on you and said you're never going to get the Holy Ghost the devil told a lie on you and you enter into that Darkness but what am I here to say is that that the devil may have told a lie on you but the word tells the truth over your life that you can go free the word tells you that you can step out this morning the devil told to Li on you but the truth has made you free the devil told you you were never going to make it and

and you walk in that darkness and you walk through those shadows and you say Lord I guess this is my I guess this is my end I guess this is where my life is going to stop because the devil has told me it and so he's told me every day I wake up the devil tells me I'm not going to make it I guess this is my end but the truth my friend shall make you free and the truth has come and told you that it's for you the truth has come and told you that the promise is for you and for your children and as many as the Lord Our God shall call the truth has come and declared unto you that you're free you're

follow you they presume that they can they think all the same message that worked for brother Burley will work for me so they tried to follow him through that red sea but they were drowned in the sea they didn't make it because this bride is going places the devil can't go you're going places in the power of God that the devil can't follow you the devil cannot go into that third pole the devil cannot go to Pentecost if you just walk with this message it'll take you places the devil can't follow you I mean it feels right now like he's right on your heels but just keep walking and all of a sudden you're like back and he's drowned in the sea he's drowned your reproach has been rolled away you say Oh Glory you say that was just for sanctification if maram could worship like that under

before the Lord but the Lord sent him and and sometimes you maybe do that you you lay fleeces before the Lord say Lord I know you told me I'm going to make it but Lord I just need to ask again am I going to make it Lord maybe I'm making you angry by now but Lord I need to know am I going to make it Lord am I going to make it Lord Oh Lord you just answered my question through the pastor last Sunday but I'm here again this Sunday Lord am I going to make it he said have not I sent you Gideon you're Mighty Man of Valor I've sent you I've sent you and you're going to make it you're going to rise above it you're going to overcome because I sent you I sent you have not I sent you has not he sent us into this age didn't he spin us off of his Immortal thoughts before the foundation of the world it's no accident you're here you came from the mind of God and you're here to overcome it's no accident that you're here God spun you off of is eternal thoughts you're an eternal attribute of God and you're here to overcome you're here to finish this thing you I don't know brother and sister I don't know what the days are going to hold ahead it looks like the coming of the Lord is so near I don't know what kind of things we're going to go through we may go through some rough few days before then but have not I sent you have not I sent you why are you worrying why are you crying Moses I've sent you to finish this thing don't worry about what's going on in the world don't worry it may seem too late it may seem like it's too late for your children to come in but there's one thing there's something in literature brother Burley called a day newon and a day newon is that final that final place where all the Loose Ends begin to tie together it's that plot where all the climax of events begins to tie together it's called the day numon that's what literature uses to tie in all the Loose Ends and and I used to read a lot of books when I was younger and I learned something that sometimes you can come to the end of a chapter sometimes you can come to the end and and you look and you see that the words don't go all the way to the end of the page so you think something's coming to an end here something's coming to an end because there's a blank at the end of this page so when I turn this page what am I going to see is it going to be the end of the book or is it just going to be the end of a chapter and you take that page and you Lord I don't understand yet the events don't make sense yet I I I I I I've still got children and Lord I I see what's going on in the world and Lord I've still got promises and Lord it looks like it's too late for look Lord it looks like it's just too late and all of a sudden you turn that page and it's not the end of the book it's the start of the last chapter and God says you know brother Ram said he would take that and he would say I don't I don't have the quote now it's somewhere but he say thank God that there's another chapter written and and I believe he was talking about a sick lady that that came in he said thank God there's another chapter written what happened you turn that page you think you're living in the last chapter sometimes you say Lord it doesn't make sense Lord why is all this fear still in my life Lord why is all this stuff going on but if you're a Son of God and a daughter of God God will tie all those loose ends together and in that last chapter you begin to realize this is what it's all about you begin to realize Lord you're you're tying it all together all the loose ends are starting to make sense uh everything I wondered about why am I like this why why am I fearful oh why have I always been different than everyone else it seems like I've always been odd I've always been different from the other children what was it it was a deep calling to the Deep on the inside of your heart something in you a jean seed that made you different than everyone else and all of a sudden you begin to come to the reality of who you are and God burst you into your identity as a son or daughter of God and you realize all the Loose Ends start to make sense everything start to make sense in that last chapter that's who you were always meant to be you were always meant to wear the Garment of this message you were always meant to wear it God tailored Elijah Elisha to fit the Garment of Elijah he didn't change the message to fit you he predestinated you to fit this message amen and you probably many of you walked in the Garment of fear for a long time many of you have walked in the Garment of suicide for a long time but there's another garment that's been hanging up in your closet for a long time why don't you try it on there's another garment hanging up over there and you've always wanted to try it on you've always felt like there was more for you you've always felt like there was more of God to to be had and you've looked over at that dress and you think my pastor dresses like that Daddy dresses like that why don't you try it on this morning say Lord I'm taking off this garment Lord I'm taking off this Garment of suicide I'm taking off this Garment of depression I'm taking off this Garment of anxiety Lord put the message on my life Lord put this message on I'm stepping in this morning I'm stepping into my commission I was always meant to be a Son of God I was always meant to be a daughter of God I'm not just here because some man sent me but God for ordained that there would be a bride on this earth that could take and they could pick up this message say lord lord it's a perfect fit Lord you ordained this Lord you must have saw something in me that I didn't see that you would call me to this message and you begin to put it on and say Lord Lord I guess I always was a Son of God I guess I always was predestined to make this Rapture and then you just start slipping it on and all of a sudden the fear just starts rolling away the depression just starts rolling away say Lord this is what it's always been about you sent me Lord you you really did send me I wondered about it Lord I put out a fleece I put out a fleece and and Gideon when he came down he got all his men you know they had to go through test and those that were fearful were sent away and those that drank water laying down were sent away because they were used to bound down to Idols but what was it doing God was filtering you for this message God filtered you many left in the first poll many came in the second poll many came but then when it came to that third poll brother Ben they all left they were only here for the Miracles they were they weren't here for the opening of the word but when the opening of the word came your way that's what hooked you and it hooked you for Rapture friends this message hooked you for the Rapture you've been filtered for this you've been filtered your friends have left you but when you were left standing there you say Lord but to whom would I go where would I go and he said no you don't have to leave I filtered you for such a time as this I filtered you to speak my word I filtered you to make a Rapture I filtered you to stand above this layer to see in darkness and shine as a Morning Star I have filtered you for this and you know Gideon came down and Gideon came and he said but if you're still worried and if you're still doubting uh he said go with furah your servant down to the enemy's camp and and you can read it in judges I I don't want to mess it up but I just just paraphrasing it he said go down with fur your servant and and Gideon walks down and he walks down and and they go down there to the camp and and they're just like grasshoppers they're everywhere and they go down and all of a sudden they begin to overhear the enemy telling about a dream that they had and it was a dream of their defeat it was a it was a dream of Gideon's Army winning the battle and oh Gideon just starts rejoicing and say Lord truly you've sent me Lord truly we are going to win Lord I wondered about it I would put fleeces and Lord I would constantly worry that maybe maybe I'm not good enough because of the family line I came out of maybe I'm not good enough because because of the situations I came out of but the Lord says I've sent you and oh they overtook that Army and they won the battle CU it wasn't a man it wasn't trusting in no man but Gideon was operating under commission Lord have not you sent me into this age for such a time as this amen just stand to your feet this morning have not I sent you you know what this message means to me friends is years ago the Lord put that on my heart that if God could do it for brother Burley if God could do it for brother Ben then because this message struck my heart that it's more than a man's idea but God gave me a revelation that this message is Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever so I begin to think Lord if you can do it for brother Burley you can do it for me and and start a Revival in your heart and it's a Revival of so can I a Revival that if it worked for Paul if it worked for brother brandom it'll work for me it'll work for me because it's the same yesterday today and forever say what do I do brother Isaac L we're going to go back to school we're going to go back to work but when the musicians can come when brother Brandon got off that plane in Memphis one time I mean he was you know he was meant he was I don't remember if he was going home or going somewhere El else but but he got off that plane and the the Lord began to deal with his heart go this way and there was a uh a widow woman that was praying for an Elijah and brother brandham didn't know that at the time but he just got off that plane and the L Spirit of the Lord began to brood with him just walk this way and he didn't know what the destination was going to be yet but it just began to brood with him just Just Walk This Way Walk This Way and he just begin to walk and all of a sudden you know the voice would come back just keep walk walking just keep walking uh you know he was leading the prophet he was in control and so instead of worrying about his flight instead of worrying about everything brother Brandon just started singing I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and what was he doing brother the Lord was telling him to just keep walking and the devil in his mind might have been telling him you're going to miss your plane you're going to miss but instead of worrying about the details he just started started enjoying the walk and many of you parents maybe you haven't enjoyed the walk in so long many of you young people you haven't enjoyed the walk in so long because you've been so worried you've been so worried about how it's all going to work out you've been so worried about how all the loose ends are going to come together you've been so worried about it that you've stopped enjoying the walk but isn't this Christian walk worth enjoying isn't this Christian walk worth laying aside every weight burying all your different all your church problems and just walking with the Lord and just just keep walking and enjoy the walk it's a good walk and remember when the devil tries to come against you and you're a Son of God and you're a daughter of God you can look into this word and be reminded have not I sent you have not I sent you and remember who you're walking with remember that you're walking with the same one that that that Paul walked with you're walking with the same one that Josh UA and Moses walked with it's not a different God this isn't a history lesson you are walking with the same one that they walked with you are walking with the same one that brother brandham walked with when all of a sudden the storm got spoken away and he's walking and all of a sudden it's just as if he was a young man and his tears begin to drip down and they would hit the leaves and it would crackle because the leaves were dry and he would look and the deer weren't scared of them and and it was as his his wife was there as if they were in their young age what were they were walking in Eden conditions again up on the mountain and remember who you're walking with and one of these days if you just keep walking with this message you'll walk back into that Eden condition and you'll be a young man again you'll be a young sister again if you just keep walking with this message Hallelujah do you love him this morning isn't he good to us amen maybe we could
