be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end until the Throne of David be um sorry there should be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this and we'll go to Matthew chapter 11 the end of the chapter and we's read verses 28 to 30 Jesus speaking says come unto me all ye that labor in a heavy laden and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer gracious Lord Jesus

well be their portion Lord strengthen them and bless them Father on this night too father we just want to commit this into your hands Lord the service have your way please Among Us in Jesus Christ's Name Lord I ask amen amen amen you may be seated amen so yes our Camp's pretty much full we're going to have a wonderful time amen amen now I want to I want to continue kind of in another way from from Sunday speaking of speaking of divine leadership and uh I want to I just want to take a thought really from from from those two scriptures that we just read um you know that there's a big change taking place here and you know when when Jesus was upon the Earth there was a change in God's government there was a change in his administration that he was going from a priesthood and and the blood of bulls and gos to now God himself will come and dwell in his people and we understand that you know many people have many people have have assembled armies they've they've given their lives to study and and many people have risen up and they've you know LED Nations into war and many people have conquered many parts of the earth and you know we know like the you know like G KH conquered probably the biggest part of the Earth has been conquered you Alexander the Great took a small arm and he conquered a far bigger nation you see the British Empire you see Napoleon you know all these men had great Ambitions and they had great desires because they wanted a name above every other name they wanted to be remembered upon the Earth but we see that they all actually ended in Failure they did not they could not build a lasting Legacy that could keep you know keep a government or a kingdom together because eventually they kingdoms fell and eventually they became just footnotes in history and so but our God is a very different kind of conqueror you know he's a very different kind of general you know he doesn't just lead from the back he leads from the front and actually he's the one that does the fighting it's not us that does the fighting he does the fighting and so Jesus if you think of it you know apparently I think it was uh Alexander the Great you know he was so you know he you know he came into the Northern parts of India and his men didn't want to go any further they said no let's let's let's turn back and he kind of he you know and then from then on he he basically got really depressed and you know he just went back to Babylon because he had his headquarters there and then he died a drunk you know so he looked at what could be conquered but his men weren't willing to go with him and he turned back and his great Ambitions came to nothing to conquer the world but then we see you know you know in great military campaigns there's a winner and there's a loser but the winner the one who conquers it's always just a limited Victory you know it's just say maybe a pel of ground or maybe a town or maybe they just drove the enemy out of a certain place you know but our God conquered more than just physical you know place our God conquered not only this realm but he conquered hell death in the grave he literally conquered everything that could be conquered amen after he arose the third day with the keys of Hell death and the grave in his hand he had he had the victory amen over everything he conquered sickness when he was here he conquered sty religion when he was here he conquered formalism when he was here he conquered a people you know he conquered a religious system that was just about you know a form and of Creeds and dogmas and things he conquered all of that I mean he conquered death you know when Lazarus was in the grave four days and and Corruption he set in he said Lazarus come forth and and the prophet tells us if he didn't use Lazarus by name if he didn't C lazarous by name there would have been a general Resurrection because the all powerful one and so he called Lazarus forth and Lazarus that was 4 days in the grave his nose fell in all different things were beginning to Decay he came forth healthy and strong and brother Braham tells us that corruption knew its master that day amen amen so every devil had to bow to Jesus Christ amen because Jesus's name is the name above all names amen amen his name because to the name of Jesus Christ every knee must bow everyone will bow to it one day but it's your choice if you'll bow now or you'll bow then because to them who bow now gets you know you know they get his victory amen they get eternal life amen it is the greatest privilege for a man or woman or child to bow to his name now amen because we understand that you know Jesus as a conqueror is not like the Nazis that just you know killed everybody and killed all the Jews and exterminated a bunch of people you know when he conquers he conquers to give life amen he conquers to to to preserve life you he conquers that people would be saved and so Jesus now you know he's a very different kind of conqueror I trust you can just just just be with me tonight amen amen because we do not serve a god of History we we serve the same living one now amen and so there was a decree when Isaiah would stand up and he would say now for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prin of peace now so he was he was actually declaring that the government or the rulership of this new kingdom was going to rest upon him it wasn't going to rest upon anyone else it was going to rest upon him you say well that's very Elementary but if you think about it now all the all the detail all of the you could say all the burden all of the responsibility lays on his shoulder it doesn't lay on your shoulder it lays on his shoulder am amen cuz many people they you know they get convicted you know they may come to church or read the Bible or hear message they get convicted and then they try and reform themselves and they try and deliver themselves from their own sin they try and Conquer their sin they say well I'm just going to try and live a better life and I'm going to try and think a little bit better today and I'm going to try and treat my family a little bit better today and you know and they're trying to conquer their own selves Lord amen and no man can conquer their own selves amen no man can actually take this flesh into subjection and make himself a new creature no matter how much good intention we may have it doesn't matter how much we would want to really be delivered of our sin it takes him to come and do it it takes him to deliver it's not you that can deliver it's him that delivers amen amen because Isaiah said upon his shoulder amen the government shall be upon his shoulder amen amen so the so the rulership you know the one in charge is going to be all upon his shoulder and this word shoulder it means the place this is this is from the Hebrew it's the place where burdens are carried amen the shoulder is the place where burdens are carried so he is he is actually saying here that it's not just the rulership and the kingship be upon him but all the burdens will be will be carried upon his shoulders you say my pastor is heavy and then what I'm carrying is heavy and I I don't think I can carry it anymore you're not meant to carry it that's right you're not meant to pack it he's meant to pack it amen if you'll let him that's the big qualifier if you'll let him amen you have to be willing to give it up because if you're not willing to give it up he can't carry it that's right that's right and that's why we read in you know Matthew 11 you know he says all that are heavy laden come unto me I want to read it again he says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy lad and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest into your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light so there's he's actually calling now take my yoke and we know the Yol is like an oxen Yol you it ties two together you know you know it's a piece of wood and things and and it actually unites two two Beast of Burden become one and normally if you if you study the how they used to plow there's always be a stronger bulock and a weaker one and they would be yolked together and then so um and it's the same thing with us am mean he's the strong one we're the weak one but he wants to take us down a certain Road amen but the only way you can do it is be yolked to him and it's not being yolked as in good intention up here you going to say it from your heart Lord I want to be yolked to you amen but if you're not willing to give it all you can't receive it all but if you give it all you'll receive it all amen amen it's that it's really that simple you say well but this all remember give it unto him upon his shoulder the burden will be carried amen am upon his shoulder not upon your shoulder not upon your good intentions and how you work things out and this is upon his shoulder because remember if he C if he packs the burden then it's his responsibility amen we have a national disaster the government calls a state of emergency now it's their problem it's not just a little Council and all these little ones trying to organize how to how to you know make best of the situation no the government steps in and and actually falls upon their responsibility and if the disaster relief goes well they get applauded but if it fails they point out who's in charge and the responsibility ultimately ends up on one person right amen times that by a billion Infinities and you understand what I'm saying right amen all the responsibility for life if you give it to him amen amen his shoulders don't get weak his shoulders don't get burdened down am me he doesn't stumble under the Loa amen hallelujah he can do it amen because he's he conquers all things thank you Lord he says this here this is Brother Braham in the pepas vision he says this is going in halfway through a story he says but there was another young man came into the world one time he died at 33 and he conquered everything that could be conquered when he was on Earth he conquered passions he conquered Pride he conquered sickness he conquered Devils when he died he conquered death when he arose he conquered hell he went up and conquered every everything that was against Mankind and and wo the vine The Wine Press of God and crushed it down and conquered death hell grave sickness formalities everything else and overcame it all and Rose on the third day and conquered all the atmospheres above and cut that mist between God and man and connected Heaven and Earth together Glory oh my there he stands the mighty conqueror since he rent The Veil and two there he is has both the keys of death and Hell hanging on his side fear not laid his right hand is power upon him which is John raised him up by the power of His right hand said don't fear I'm he that was and that is and shall come I'm the first and the last I am he that lived and died and is alive again forever man glory to name I mean forever more amen so he conquered everything I'm sure I've established that I'm sure you know that he conquered everything but then you have to be willing for him to conquer you right amen you have to be willing for him to conquer you it's not just Conquering the sickness and the situations in life he's going to ultimately conquer you amen amen you're going to put your hands up and say Lord take this situation I Surrender it to you yes sir amen you have to be willing to do it amen amen that you got to be willing to just lay it all down things come into life you got to say oh God oh my amen you see in the Old Testament when they go to a you real D straight remember it wasn't like you know like Gideon and the amalekites and the know the milites people of the East came in ate up the whole land now the ultimate thing that they had to be delivered from wasn't those people it was the idolatry they found themselves in yes amen they had to be delivered from that God allowed the people to come into the land that they would call upon God they weren't calling upon God when they are bowing themselves down to devil worship right amen but that had to be conquered that was the UL and and notice the first thing when the angel comes to Gideon he says go to your father's house break down the idol amen make make an altar to God and and sacrifice there the first thing conquer this devil amen amen he actually gave him the ability to to defeat the enemy in his home that's right and that was and that and then from that stem the whole victory over the people see the idol worship had to be conquered because idol worship is self-will amen because Rebellion is what is his witchcraft amen so Rebellion what is rebellion I know best right I know what I'm doing I've got it under control God have mercy now some things in life sure we have given God God given abilities to do things but when it comes to walking the way that we should go if you think I know what I'm doing I'm experienced in this sure thing is you're going down a Garden Path someplace right I can guarantee it and you'll find yourself in in some place and you'll say how did I get there that's right and you can't say it was this thing or this thing you say no it's actually I got myself here amen amen so you got to be willing to let him conquer you amen oh God help now in the book of Exodus let's just turn to the Book of Exodus chapter 4 just want to read this may we are talking about Divine leadership amen I'm not interested in religion I'm not interested in saying this is how we should do things because this is how I feel we should do things amen every man is right in his own eyes I don't want to think I'm right in my own eyes Lord examine me amen yes sir put me through your filter whatever under your microscope amen amen to see Lord is there anything is my simple action is there something in my life that's not pleasing to you amen right Exodus chapter 4 now God is God is commissioning Moses in this chapter and this is this is uh let's just read from verse one cuz I like it when he when he cast down the rod as well and Moses answered and said but behold they will not hearken I mean they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord has not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod and he said cast It On The Ground he cast It to the Ground became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod again that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob has appeared unto thee and the Lord said furthermore put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold it was his hand was leprous as snow I'm going to talk I'm just going to read this ver and and he said put thy hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it turned again as it was the other flesh now remember Moses Moses was actually God to the people don't you understand that's right God told Moses you'll be God and Aaron will be your Prophet so now what Moses begins to do in his life he's actually displaying God am mean you see you see when when God actually told them this is this is that you know you're down the journey God actually tells Moses I'm sick of these people I'll wipe them off I'll start with you and then Moses stood on the breach he says blot me out of your book don't blot them out remember what you you know the promise you gave to the forefathers and all these different things that was Christ and Moses standing in the breach amen so everything Moses did it was actually God being displayed and then so God was actually showing showing him Moses life now when he took the staff and he put it down it came into a cobra and he picked it up again now the the symbol of the Pharaoh was the Cobra he is the king of the snakes am mean so he was showing through moses' life he was saying I can loose you Satan and I can bind you Satan am mean just as much as I want I can loose you and I can bind you I can loose you and I can bind you and you can't bite me amen amen so he goes into Mo uh you know Pharaoh's court and he says let my people go remember they're God's people not moses' people God speaking first person through a man I trust that doesn't stump you and then so he says let my people go and he says I'll not let them go he says okay to prove that God's with me he throws his rod down turns into a serpent and then Pharaoh he says this is just a cheap trick and he gets his magicians to do the same thing and then Moses snake eats up eats up the magician snakes amen just to prove now that God's power is greater than a mimic and then not only eat them up he he grabs by a tail it turns into a staff again where did where did The Magicians stars go they consumed by God's power and God was actually Moses was demonstrating to Pharaoh I'll loose you and you'll try and loose some power against me my power consume yours I'll pick mine up again as if nothing happened amen I'll bind you Satan I'll loose you Satan amen because remember God was in Moses Satan was in pharaoh and there's a contest going on right there and God was demonstrating I'll loose you I'll bind you I'll do whatever I want with you you have no control over me Let My People Go and God made Pharaoh give eventually he hardened his heart CU he wanted to magnify his power and just remember if you find resistance if you find put yourself in the story if you find resistance amen God's just magnifying his power he want to demonstrate himself S I mean if there's a if if there's something in your soul saying they're mine they must be free amen they must go and and and it's not them resisting remember it's Satan resisting amen I'll not let that person go and you'll say you will I'll make you let them go amen that's what Moses did I'll make you let them go and he just plagued them as much as he wanted to do as his live by God to do it amen so God was demonstrating now I bind you and I loose you and I bind you and I loose you I can do whatever I want with you and then not only that so so he was demonstrating that Moses God was showing through Moses that I have all power over the devil and not only that when he put his hand in his bosom it came out his lepos remember leprosy is a type of sin in the scripture so he's actually demonstrating I'll take that leprosy and I'll take it to myself amen that when you come out again amen that leprosy is gone amen amen I'll take Humanity to myself amen and then when I release you again amen when you're embraced by him Hallelujah all the sin all the unbelief is gone I mean all that unbelief is burned out Hallelujah and and that's what he's demonstrating so God was actually saying now Moses through Moses he saying now it's my responsibility I'm actually imposing a government upon these people and this is what I'm going to enforce in their lives the devil's going to be bound you know loosed and bound he's he's under my dominion and then all the sin of the people's going to be dealt with and then they're going to be restored to what they should have been that's what's being demonstrated there when he took his hand to his bosom and then that was just a prefigure because everything in the Old Testament is just a shadow of the new and then now here comes Jesus because remember there's a prophecy from from the from the Garden of Eden the first words that God speaks to the devil he says the seed of the woman is going to crush your head that's the first promise he of Satan this is what's going to happen and then whenever that serpent Bruiser looks like he's going to arrive that you know that's when Satan tries to kill all the young babies that's why he tried to kill the males there in Egypt cuz he knew that that serpent Bruiser he knew there was going to be a Deliverance happening we must stop this Deliverance he said but God said you will not stop my Deliverance amen amen so then Moses was kept and all those things happened and then the same thing happened when Jesus was born and Herod tried to kill the two-year-olds and down because he knew he was worried oh where is he born King of the Jews what king Hallelujah and then so he said you know and then and then so that will happen because the serpent the serpent Bruiser was coming amen Christ himself that not Not only would take dominion over all the Devils upon the Earth but then he had conquer the head devil amen and when the head Devils conquered all the other ones blow and fall amen you see that in you know in that service there all the meetings in you know in Oregon you know brother B he talking about faith that big man comes that devil possessed man comes onto the platform I'll tear you liom from Li standing a big massive guy spits in his face and all these different things and brother bram's a train box remember when he was young he so so he could have tried to take him on but he knew this wasn't a flesh and blood of fear and this guy had had gone to other meetings and punched out preachers before amen and then so now he says no because you've challenged the servant Living God you'll fall at my feet is dead that's exactly what happened and the police come and say well is he dead no he's not dead but can you get him off my feet and then he said as I saying faith is the substance of things hope for and then people begin to get healed and people just getting delivered and everyone just got healed in the meeting why cuz the head devil had just been defeated amen hallelujah and we must recognize the head Devil's defeated amen tonight Satan himself he has he doesn't have the keys to his own house amen he doesn't even have control the Church of the Living God can bind him and can loose him right hallah can bind them and can loose them and not only that they can take people and lift them into the presence of God that there's leprosy is undone cuz he's the mighty conqueror that is not wives tales it's reality when Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon the people and their unbelief and all their things were cleansed out of them because the Holy Ghost fell upon them Acts chapter 10 amen so our God is still alive amen but now let's go to Hebrews 2 I'll read another scripture he says this here Hebrews 2:9 but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death remember he's going to he's going to take something upon his shoulder here he comes he's going to he says for this cause I've come into the world and that cause was to take sin upon himself I mean here's our lamb remember the sacrif the sin offering took the sin of the person upon them amen that the sin was transferred from the person to them amen because the Judgment wasn't cast upon the worshipper the Judgment was cast upon the lamb and that's why the lamb died because that sin was now attributed not to the worshiper but to the lamb amen so now he's going to he's going to take he's going to take something upon his shoulder because the government's upon his shoulder and we're going to see how he's going to deal with this but we see Jesus who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom all are all things in the beig and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that s pardon me for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren saying I will declare thy name uh thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he all he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death all this lifetime subject to bondage for verely he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things that behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and the things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that himself have suffered being tempted he is he is able to to secure them that are tempted and that word actually means to help to Aid to relief there he comes now he says come unto me come unto me ye that are heavy laden come unto me remember Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we're not talking about a God in history or back on Galilee saying come on you know that same voice is speaking out tonight he says come unto me all ye that are labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest you got to take my yoke upon you take take my yoke upon you for it is light am mean so it has to be an exchange where you have to be willing what uh you know not only just to because some people they just want him as Savior but not Lord but you can't have both you you can't have them separate they have to be both if you want him to be savior then he has to be your lord he has to be your ruler he has to be your king because if I don't acknowledge the government you know what why am I not an American citizen I don't have the citizenship papers I don't recognize their government I'm not part of their Kingdom or their country amen but because I was born in New Zealand and by birth I'm a citizen then then he is then then then the Beehive whoever's there prime minister he is my ruler because of where I'm born amen it's the same thing being a Christian because I've been birthed by the spirit of God that are because by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body or to one Kingdom I could say so because of been birth into that Kingdom he is my king amen and his he is my government you understand but the only way that can ever happen is you not only recognize him as Savior but also Lord because a lot of people they want God to help them with things but they don't actually want they're not willing so they want him to conquer th those situations Lord conquer of these problems but ultimately as I said about getting your you read judges they get delivered they fall into idol worship and they get delivered they you know and there's a cycle that keeps going down and the first thing that's normally causes them to be free is that God deals with the idol actually conquers them right God uses a man to conquer the people and then the people conquer the enemy amen so God you have to be willing now not just for him to deal with your problems conquer your problems he has to conquer you amen amen that's right and if you're willing if you're willing to let them conquer you then everything else will whatever happens with that that's irrelevant amen if you're willing to let them conquer you amen because if you let him conquer you just like if we invaded Australia The Beehive would be in charge of Australia our government would extend over them if we conquer them y amen it's the same thing if you're willing to surrender to him then his government will come upon you amen amen amen and this is not just a mental thing if you're willing to really surrender everything then his government the government shall be upon his shoulder so if you lay yourself at his feet then you are his responsibility amen amen but if you're not willing to do that then you are not his responsibility it's very simple amen so he took the sin of the world upon his shoulder amen but then he didn't you know but then when he arose he didn't carry that sin burden anymore amen amen and then when you arise when you arise I'm not pulling it strings when you lay your burden down remember take your you it's an exchange we're born with this weight of sin Upon Our shoulders and it's not by the we've done we are born in sin sh iniquity come to this world speaking Lies We have this debt on us so we cannot pay so it's not because I lie cheat or steal that's irrelevant that's only things to make you recognize you're a sinner oh I've got a temper I do or whatever that just makes you recognize you're a sinner but you actually got this debt that you were birthed with amen amen you were birth with a debt right and then so the only way to get rid of that debt is not to try and reform yourself because brother Braham says really simply it's like a pig you can take a pig out of the mud and then you can clean up the pig and you can put a lamb coat on the pig but it's because that pig Nature's in the pig he'll run to the m amen it's like a man who's in great debt and then a very successful business comes along and says I'll pay you out of debt you know no you know no strings attached I'll pay you debt off now that is wonderful but if the nature in the man doesn't change he can fall into dead again but if the nature that's in the wealthy man goes into that man he won't go to dead anymore amen so we can just be justified and our debt is wiped off but if we're only just Justified we can still go back into that rut again amen it takes the life of God to come into US amen amen that we won't go back into those things anymore so it's an exchange I don't know really how to wind this up but I trust it things down deep you have to be willing he says take my yoke upon you well if I'm carrying something I got to get rid of that to pick on something else amen amen so you can't have you can't have his yoke and you can't have your yoke you have to exchange your yoke for his it doesn't matter if it's a yoke of bitterness or you know depression or feeling sorry for myself or whatever it is whatever the Yoke may be and you may feel justified in your position against people whatever but the scripture tells us do not let any root of busness come within thee because by which many are defiled amen well they did wrong to me irrelevant because at the end of sure they may have you you may be justified to feel a certain way against people but if you hold on to that you can't take his yoke amen you can't take his burden you can't let his government go upon your shoulder you can't do it amen friends don't carry your own burden amen amen amen don't carry don't carry things we're not made to carry things a sheep is not a beast of burden amen I don't know if you've ever studied sheep they're not a beast of burden a muers a camel or whatever but a sheep is not a beast of burden and we're made like Sheep amen if you put a burden on the sheep it'll eventually break its leg or do something and it won't be able to move anymore amen that's why you got to let the great Shepherd come amen amen not in just in good intentions but you got to be willing your whole identity you got to be willing to lay yourself die to yourself whatever you think you are it must die amen amen oh I'm a message beli ver that must die I know the doctrine it must die I'm a Christian that must die amen I'm self-righteous that must die amen amen that all must die I'm a good Christian I've been raised in church that must die amen I believe in Jesus only that must die CU that's just religion without knowing him the Rich Young Ruler kept all the Commandments from his youth he was a model Christian I'll put it this way he was a model Christian but he did not have eternal life and he wasn't willing to take his yoke upon him and then take Jesus's yoke upon himself amen because Here Comes Divine leadership becomes before Jesus he says what must I do to inherit eternal life he says s all you have give to the poor take up your cross and follow me Here Comes The Godly instruction now this is what you need to do and the Rich Young Ruler knew he didn't have what he needed otherwise he would never have come to Jesus and so here was now this is all he had to do yes Lord sell it all take up his cross and follow her that's all he had to do he could have gone because he would have had you know being being someone Rich you normally have people to help you out and you know your accountants and so on he could have called up his accountant sell everything give it to these people done Lord amen I got to bring it to you know bring it today's language that's all he had to do send an email hold on I'll just WhatsApp my accountant sell it all it's done but he wasn't willing he wasn't willing to do it because he justified himself but I keep the law he was sad when he went away said he went away sad but he justified himself because if he didn't justify himself he would never have walked away sad what what he justified himself in I can use this money to help people if I get more money I can help more people I can help the synagogue I can help repair the temple I can do good Christian things I believe in Jehovah too amen it wasn't enough for what he needed amen and the government shall be upon his shoulder I'm just going to close it right there but you have to be willing amen if you're not willing he can't help you amen amen let's bow our head shall we gracious Lord father such a lord it's a simple thing but yet it's not a simple thing father we haven't come to have our ears tickled but father we've come for a close to walk with you amen Lord Jesus dear Lord and I was so touched when I thought of this father and Lord how the government's upon your shoulder Lord you're in charge we are your responsibility father we can't help ourselves we can't deliver ourselves Lord we can't cause ourselves to uh be better Christians in our own strength alone but father it takes you ultimately yes Lord father it takes you to come and consume the sacrifice it takes you to put your life in it takes you to Deliver us from sin it takes you to Deliver Us from bondage dear Lord Jesus it takes you father to do these things Lord no man can do it in their own strength father because people have tried Generations have tried father to to to be Christians in their own strength and they've miserably failed Lord we saw Israel Lord we see it in the Old Testament they miserably failed because they wanted to do it their way they wanted to keep a law father your Prophet said that how Grace brought them out of Egypt Grace gave them gave them a profit Grace gave them the way to sacrifice but they wanted something to do and they failed and Lord we don't want to fail Lord just because we're the side of the Cross doesn't mean we can't fail so father I pray You' take us now dear Lord father is anyone here who hasn't surrendered totally to you really really surrendered to you not just out of good Ambitions but it's really just giving it over to you father if they're holding anything in Lord may they just confess it to you right now father may they lay it at your feet Lord father may they give it to you oh god father may they not hold on to it Lord Jesus father I just pray oh God you just have your way in this service now Lord father help us Lord I pray be with each one dear God our government Lord Lord the government's upon your shoulder father may we not try and live The Message In Our Own Strength Lord may we not try and be Christians in our own strength Lord may we not hide behind quotes and Bible verses Lord no doubt the Rich Young Ruler tried to hide behind Bible verses and quotes of Moses but he couldn't do it Lord ultimately Lord as he said when he was old he had Barns and everything he said now my soul can rest and that night he said to him you full your souls required of you when you went to hell father we don't want to end up in that predicament Lord he was looking for rest for his soul and he came to the Fountain but he wasn't willing to to surrender to the Fountain father May that not be our portion Lord I believe it's not by your grace thank you Lord dear Lord I commit each one into your hands father mold us over again would you Lord thank you Lord Lord we lord we want to every burden we carry Lord even it's not a sin burden if we've given to that that to you years ago Lord but if we have things we hold on to against people and you know questions and and and problems
