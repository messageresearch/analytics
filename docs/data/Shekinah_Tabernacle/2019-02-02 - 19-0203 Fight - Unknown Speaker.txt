Lord that in you and your spirit Lord has so much power to enjoy so much power to overcome father when we wait upon you and when we're filled with the Holy Ghost we refreshed with the Spirit of God Lord we're an invincible army there's nothing nothing that can come against us that we'll ever overcome us Lord Lord in our own strength we fail many many times on a daily basis father but help us to wait upon you Lord to to get all of our strengths from you Lord that the spirit man will be refreshed day by day and the flesh man will be put to death as Paul said I die daily Lord that's our that's our desire as a believer Lord and those are the things that you died for you didn't die Lord that this flesh man could have a good time but you died that the spirit could dwell on us and we could learn from your life to Christ Lord say we just pray you'll continue to bless us this morning lovely some brother Ben sister Christina zero way Lord bless those that are streaming and Lord we just thank you so much for your great grace towards us we just want to invite you into our prisons into our midst this morning Lord make you feel welcome may may not just our body being here make you feel welcome but may our spirit make you feel welcome Lord may our attitude mayor may our heart towards you make you feel welcome will make may our heart be open to you Lord to receive from you receive from your word Lord to there would be a dwelling-place to your spirit Lord to risk further may we have the right attitude about us Lord like a like a lamb a sheep Lord that the Dove can rest upon may we just put the things of the week and anything that we've been through and all this sort of stuff aside Lord and put our spiritual thinking caps on this morning Lord - to hear from you so we just want to commit this service to you this morning and just welcome you in our midst in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you all this morning you can um you can take your seats this morning praise the Lord amen how was it where I'm doing this morning good that's good okay I've got um I've had a little thought that that I've wanted to speak on and brother Freddy I think he preaches slightly on it last I think was two weeks ago when he was here and it's um yes sir some thoughts you you learn about and then you speak about and other thoughts you kind of go through a lot of things and then you speak about what you know about but those ones are slightly easier to talk about then ones that you learn about and speak about although there is a place for that because hey we can't go through everything all the time so some things we just have to learn for instance I couldn't really tell you what it's like to be a grandfather you know but maybe brother Franny he could because he's a grandfather but there are things I haven't been through which sure maybe I could speak about and try and show what the word says about it and what brother Branham says about it and things but you know when you go through things it's different you can you can talk about it so do we have anything going on there I've got a are we going on us okay now I don't really look like a fighting sort of a guy right [Laughter] however we are as Christians fighters with fighters we're not we're not like little weak people that have no backbone we've got courage we've got tenacity we've got determination let's how we do it and if there's anything I've learned in the Christian walk it's the fact that it's a constant fight fighting we've got a fight fight fight and I'm not going to tell you something that you haven't heard already but as Peter said you know I'm gonna stir these things up to your remembrance to just to help us to you know remember these things but also this did help me in my walk when I learnt when I when I fully understood that this is just a fight you know when I became reserved to that effect when I accepted it then I I guess I just got on with it started doing it rather than you know when things get hot and here but you kind of complained otherwise like this now I've accept that it will always be like this that's the way that it is is a brother that doesn't he does these creation science evangelism type things he's very witty guy and he says life is tough and then you die get over it and hey you know we've got to have a certain attitude in our Christian walk otherwise the the constant attacks of the enemy are going to get us down and we don't want to be we want to be a victorious people we don't we don't we want to go out victorious we don't want to go out you know we want to go out victorious that's who we are as a people and and that's that's what faith speaks of us faith speaks of us victory faith speaks of us that we're strong people that we're a mighty people it doesn't speak that we're are weak people now I'm not talking about our flesh men I'm talking about a spirit men anywhere oh I'll get into this because I've got a few things to get thrown off that preaching all the other slides before I get there and let's stand up once more just read this this this one here this is one first Timothy 6:12 and it says fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto there are also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses fight the good fight of faith and I've got another verse this is from Exodus 15 verses 1 through 2 3 then saying Moses in the children of Israel of the song answer the Lord and spake saying I will sing unto the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god and I will prepare him in habitation my father's God I will exalt him in verse 3 I like this verse the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Amen there's one more as I have 42 verse 13 the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yay roar he shall prevail against his enemies amen you can make all bliss of reading as well you can take your seats this morning I'm just gonna put that one ear back up right the Lord is a man of war the Lord has his name right now if you who's seen my son David he looks kind of similar to me and unfortunately for him he's got a similar natural personality to me and I'm battling with it so much hope is not listening because it's who knows like that if you're a parent here you see in your children you ought your they seem to in here all of your weaknesses are none of your streets and you're like manners some sort of a cruel joke and then you've got to spend your life trying to explain to them and get it out of them and it's awful within you almost get embarrassed when you see it but nonetheless why our endeavor as parents you see our traits and them right there you they look like us whatever we want them to be well you know we want to instill values in them well the Lord is the same with us with his children he wants to see his own values and his children his own attributes and you know we think of God as merciful and years and he's he's loving and he's he does all these things but one of the things he is he's a fighter he's a man of war and I think he wants to see their attribute also in us he wants to see us as fighters me and a woman of war he doesn't want to see us sitting back he wants to see his attributes in us I'll just read you this quote because this is brother man talking and adoption he says but what if he comes up that's Abraham's Grace Covenant and says but there's certain ones I'm telling you they are really your sons I don't care what takes place they stand for what you say they just act like you that man just acts exactly like you he does the same he says the same thing you do if the hired servants is throwing a thing you don't care it's his father's business I must be about it he just tears it up and says you shall not do that to my father my father said so and so and you you took the commands of God and made them a tradition of men no such a scripture in the Bible for such as stuff as that I know this is referring to something else but I just wanted to bring up the thought of adoption you know we we place all these other things but part of the adoption processes us becoming as us having all the attributes of God and becoming all that that the Lord desired for us to have and and as a as a people and actually restored back to you all that that the Ephesian Church was and those men were tough hey those men and woman were warriors and they stood in the face of adversity and they fought and that's what we are doing and we will continue to do that's that's our that's gonna be our testimony okay and yet as a Christian we have these we you know we get these other scriptures like this one it'd be possible as much as lieth and you look peaceably with all men so where you start reading these scriptures about how a Christian is and it all talks about living peaceably and being gentle in by this one behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be easy for wires and serpents and harmless as doves and we're now as a new Christian you start you and you think hakham I'm gonna be told to be this gentle kind of guy that is like a little lamb and I don't do anything that I just you know trot around but that's not really meaning in this context right Paul says but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cheerin which into right and then Titus 3 2 this is speaking about a deacon like a big strong deacon no no to speak evil of no man to take to be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness and to all men right so so there's there's a one part of us set to fight at this bit but then these all these other scriptures saying we're actually these gentle meek peace-loving people that you know seemingly are just weaklings and a sense in a worldly since you guys are weaklings man you've gotta have some you know tenacity to you here's another one but we were gentle among you even as a nurse to earth your children I just said that one who knows this these two men here this is um the men on the writers arm David Wilkinson and the men on the younger on the lifters are Nicky Cruz you read the story of um the cross and the Switchblade it's a I think Nicky I think Dave Wilkinson was inspired of the Lord to go and do that and he in if you read the book it's I think he was a very very um he was a godly man and he went into the the streets of New York to help out these to try and bring the gospel to these young um guys that have just formed gangs that were they were it had sort of no family in America that come from other countries and but very violent very violent very angry mean that that had lead miserable lives like Nicky Cruz's mother and father hated at least that beat him and all sort things Tilghman they just told him you'll never be nothing I hate you and so he thought well if my parents hate me then everyone hates me if I can't trust him I can't trust anyone and he just then he moved to New York and he went there mad and angry and he these men just always just start being led by Satan to door sorts of stuff and and David Wilkinson bailed on us hard to go and visit these me and it outreach to them and I think in his first visit he wanted to go and see Nicky and he just knew he told him and not and all sorts words to go away then he went back to the gang he called us to where they were I guess it was just a little pass and went to see him and on the second meeting Nicky was so angry the meat was swearing at him and cursing God and all these things and he punched them and the other guys are saying hey Nicky just leave the guy alone you know he's just coming here to say hello to you because Nick David st. and if he had just want to be your friend God loves you and he's punching him and saying go away I don't want to know you I don't want to know God all these things and I think that the other game he was about so sorry for Nicky because he was such a sort of skinny little country white guy they like hey this guy's you know he's not here to beat you up man you see probably just to help you but in the end he was converted I'm not this is not part of my sermon but I just wanted to give him some explanation of that right but that was Nicky Cruz's upbringing so so after he was converted he began doing street preaching outreaching and I guess people's perception of a Christian is that you're a weakling you know they're just this weakling goody-good you know been no we've done nothing kind of you know what I mean right and so Nicky is out reaching on the street and then people walking past them saying oh you little pansy you know one guy started mocking and making fun of him calling their little mama's boys and I think he I think the flesh must have gotten a bit upset by that and so maybe he still carried as a switchblade around because he was maybe in the process of would you yeah change like like Hamlet what do we call it sanctification right so maybe you still keep the switchblades I think his flesh overcame him at one point of his outreach and he had enough of this guy telling him it was just a net and the Annette say pulled his knife out wrestled the guy to the ground put us the knife to his throat he said if you don't commit your life to Jesus you'll be a dead man so but that's not quite how we outreach well well that's that's not what it's talking about to be a fighter but that's kind of a that was a sort of a crossover you know okay little because the Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood we don't wrestle against people the people not our target ever ever ever it is never ever another human being that is our target that we wrestle against ever never and anytime we get any sort of something towards another person that's anything but perfect love that's wrong any attitude any thought any desire it's absolutely wrong there's a no-go zone for a believer and no-go zone that's it you you do not come against another person the fights never against them that's who the fight is for it doesn't matter what they do to you doesn't matter how much they how much nasty things they do to you they can call you anything this that and the other thing it doesn't matter the fight is never against them ever and Jesus said when he was on the cross Father forgive them for they know not what they do the Spirit of God knows that the fight is never against another person never ever against a human being see I flee sometimes I'll get okay for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places that's what we wrestle against then unfortunately those things can come upon people and cause them to do things but it's never the person that does it it's never the person that does it it's it's always whatever's come upon them that make them do that it's always there and now we have to keep that in mind otherwise we can get upset with things when we shouldn't ever get upset with things that's not a true warrior it's we're going to be fighting in the wrong place if we do that now I've got this little diagram because you talk about war fighting an order for there to be a fight or some sort of conflict you have to essentially have one thing and two people want the same thing basically all these different opinions on how that things should be there has to be some sort of conflict in this case say a war one country wants that place and then the people that veer generally say no we want to keep this place and so they have a disagreement and they they if they've both got courage enough and them they both fight have a fight over you know the certain particular area I know this is basic stuff but this is this is conflict right this is this is what we this is conflict this is how human beings work all this nonsense will be over when it's all done but this is currently how this stuff works but we all do this I thought this one up here as well right this starts from when you were very very small hey and there's like ten balloons and there's two children it but they both want the green balloon hey there's another green balloon there but they want that green balloon in there hey and they and they both want it so they fight over it they fight fight for this green balloon you've done their day but the Bible says when we grow up we put off childish things and that means fighting and disputing a maxi shadow and all those things those are childish things right you know this is this is the this is the carnal nature and its purest form you know fight over everything he took that I want that back you know it's no restraint to how we act when we get the Spirit of God the spirit of God can restrain how we act because we act through the Spirit of God rather than through our carnal nature we say you keep that balloon you know what you have all the balloons there ever Rose you can keep them all you know what does it matter live peaceably with all men we start to understand these ways we can live our life to actually let God be in control rather than us we try and control situations so much and think we've got it we've got act here and make it work for our benefit we don't have to do that that's our flesh the more we trust in God we realize we can just you can just give up let God do it guys a far better man of war than we are and within those things right now here's a here's a little diagram about us an hour an hour life before crisis this is what it looks like we're in the enemy's camp we're serving Satan we just as brother branham Synod I've got a quote with slouching there were just sitting around you know and we're just going with the flow we actually don't have any fight in us people people in the state that think they're strong a mistaken yes and I care what your body looks like that key how many guys you can think you can beat up we're mistaken we're not strong we're going with the flow we're weaklings we're just going with whatever there's no restraint there's no fight really a there's no fight in this state can we just sit back right okay let this this that's weak to me that's not it's not strong you don't have to fight anything in that state for someone's fighting for you when we're in that state God's fighting for us unbeknownst to us he's actually fighting for us to get us we when we don't even really want it he's fighting for us and it's actually our job as Christians to fight brothers when they don't even want it that's what Jesus did he fought for us Father forgive them they know not what they do okay so now now we have this conversion of me so I'm going to serve the Lord I don't want to serve Satan anymore I don't want to be in his kingdom I want to serve the Lord we switch camps and then a wee bit of trouble starts after that for us because suddenly we're sun-soaked on or he's change sides or his he oh that's how it is is it and if you know Satan he's so predictable yes because he can't help hating he can't help getting back at you he just that's why that's why God can play him like a fool every time because he can't help just he has to act in a in an evil way all the time he can't do you understand what I mean he's so he's so predictable and that's why worldly people can can get but the Bible says that the children of this world are a neared a wiser than the children of light in terms of worldly activities because when you think evil you think okay that guy's going to act like this avoid Esther to him here like like that towards me so then I've been to do this to counter that right and it's all that's all you can predict how the carnal nature will act that's why when they come across a Christian that excellent so the X differently they think well this is odd he hasn't responded the way that they should usually respond what's happening here this is different you understand but that's the way but the cattle so Satan is he can't help boasting he can't help hoping he can't help doing all these things it's just how he works he's pretty predictable that's why I'm there he always has to have symbols and things and all of it and there's rock stars always have to be in it he has symbols all over his pictures and everything just to show that this is me you know you can't just thought it's a shot to me that's not what I'm speaking about but so but now you have it you have a small problem in this situation still you've got an enemy that you just came out of the Satan's camp so he's upset with you but you've also got this carnal nature that actually is still within you right that that that actually still doesn't like it doesn't like this new sitting it doesn't like the new setting that you're in and the truth be known it never ever ever will like the new sitting listen right never it's never going to be happy there it's never ever going to be satisfied it's never going to say you know what it's been years and years you've been here for so long let's just accept it as the winners be happy I'll never bother you anymore I'm content that hey you've won I give up it is never ever ever going to do that to you I'm never gonna say that to you it's gonna fight you as long as you're in that camp as long as you're there it's going to fight you every single day you talk about a fight you've got a you've got you've got the cyber Kingdom upset with you that you've left them so they're fighting against you then you've got this thing inside you on top of that it's also five minutes then you stand that you took and and then just one more thing if you actually decide to you know what I'm actually going to fight against his kingdom - and try and bring out the people where I am then you're really in trouble and your whole life from this point onwards is basically going to be a constant constant fight constantly from all sides there is never going to be any risk ever I don't want to make bit Sun bleak but I want to make that reality right now the Lord gives us three sativa fishes us but we that comes into it but in terms of the state that we run there will never be rest it will never be there will never be a day with the enemy goes leave them alone you know during not so much now but when men had more morals and values than meant men were that they you know had more more more morals within them during like the head rules of war that okay in this situation you don't do this you don't do that you don't do that or they would say you know they'll be fighting in World War one and they would say look you know there are so many few bodies and no man's then here let's say let's just have a couple of days of peace and we're going get all that did people bury them and then we'll carry on fighting yes we'll agree to that and they would go and do it no they would have agreements that enemies would decide little agreements and they would stick to them but these days that doesn't quite happen you know they'll say oh yeah we'll do that and then it's a truck to get you out there than they shoot you all you know but the devil what you can't make agreements with them he won't just say oh let's just make this agreement he's always fighting against us so so now in this situation here this is now you and I because we are all now in the New Kingdom we've decided to follow the Lord and where you're actually pursuing Satan's Kingdom that's why we come here that's why we fight for the Lord so this is us right you we're all reserved to that fact that our whole life from today onwards or whenever it was there's going to be a constant fight that's why Paul said fight the good fight of faith now we're and women get reserved to that we kind of accept it and go yeah let's do this okay this is the scripture here that shows because the carnal man is enmity against God for he is not subject to the law of man neither indeed can be right this is little black guy I showed you right it's imminent he against God unfortunately he sticks around but he's enmity that means he's hates it they cannot coexist together and yet they had somehow I have to right now there's only one solution for the carnal men there's only one solution for the carnal man and it's not seven steps how to train the carnal man or how to cooperate with the carnal man there's only one solution to the carnal man and every man that striveth for the mastery as temper and all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the year but I keep my body and bring it under subjection less therefore any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway there's only one method to control the carnal man and that's this word subjection right bring it under subjection it means I'm gonna fight against you and beat you down I'm gonna beat you down and I'm gonna keep you under subjection all the time yeah I'm gonna constantly fight against you and I'm going to win and you're gonna be beating down daily have I got that scripture there yeah that's well that's why Paul says I protest why you rejoice so much I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die daily now Paul is alive every day but he's saying that the flesh man dies daily the spirit man beats them down beats them up and the man is the life to Christ lives now now we say praise the Lord which we should but it's not as easy as that right hey it's not like oh this is just an easy fight it's a fight and if you lit up and now I just relax for a couple of days what happens the sky gets a little bit stronger comes back at you suddenly you might do something you didn't want to do you think ah and then Satan comes at you and says I see you you're not really as good as what you thought you were and then you can even feel even worse and it's a fight fight fight when you're walking in the spirit you don't fulfill those lusts of the flesh that's what the Bible says walk in the spirit you won't fulfill the lusts of the flesh but you know when we might overwork ourselves or do too you know our brave we might get caught up in things and then it's yeah we don't walk in the spirit as much we don't tend to the things of God as much we don't drink enough water right we get a headache Hey and then I mean these things that but it's a constant fight now don't feel bad if sometimes this guy ones it's not you that like we said the other day that man has an expiry date he's got an expiry date he's not going to be around forever he's got an expiry date so anything he does Satan's gonna actually pay for anyway anything that he does I want to read you some quotes from brother Branham just to talk about what I've just spoken about is it possible for a Holy Ghost person to be driven driven by or to do minor things influenced to do minor things that he doesn't want to do oh yes yes sir yeah a Holy Ghost fell person you're right in the place then to be to be drove by those things you just put yourself up a target when you're down there serving the devil he just lets you slouch around any way you want but you once take a stand for Christ you've got on the other side then he trains every gun right around on you every temptation everything that could be throwed to you then you got it but what have we got greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world see there wasn't and no battle here you was just slopping around hay slopping around but now you've cleaned up you've dressed up you've shaved you've combed you here you've put on a uniform you've got a gun in your hand let's go see you're in battle not to show off but to fight fight sure when the temptations arise with the spirit the shield of faith buck it off and move on see this right I put all put all the whole armour of God why do you put on an armor if you're not going to fight all soldiers address to fight not to show off walk out and say then you all can't say I'm some so now I'm a Christian see who am I belonged to science Oh hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost the other night sure nothing bothers me anymore but he's speaking sarcastically oh brother I believe you better go back and try again see I'm telling you when as soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost Satan's got every gun on you shooting you then you've got the whole armor on then take the shield of faith the sword of the Spirit or the word and take the buckle on and show yourself with the gospel and take the old middle piece here and breastplate and pull it up pull up the clinch on it and tighten yourself up a little bit and get ready for it because it's coming don't you worry yes sir you're going to have plenty of trouble plenty of trouble but remember greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world where our victorious people I like people with courage I don't I'll leave it no I'll say it as a as human thinking is something that I've perceived because I'm not political whatsoever I don't agree in political stuff I agree in the kingdom of God but what has taken what what is what people have gotten all happy about Trump is is that he's got fight in him that's what they like about it man this guy's got fight he can fight back and it's made people realize we can fight back people like someone that fights back you know that was parish brother Brennan was a fighter he fought back he fought back and that's who we are we fight back but we just got to fight for the right things we can fight our whole life for something that's in the vein imagine that putting all your energy into something that's a complete that's what waste of time is spending all your energy onto it I'm so glad that we can fight for the kingdom of God and for his word that's all I want to fight for because I'm tired of investing my fight in my life and do things that are temporal in that waste time and that don't come to anything i'ma fight for things that are gold and silver so when it's all been said and done when the when it always laid out that was gold that your fought for there that was silver and I've want to turn up with hay in the fire burns and it's gone all that was a waste of time wasn't it i'ma fight for things if they're eternal I'm gonna read you something from Acts about the disciples and they came certain that came to the certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead how bad as the disciples stood around him he rose up and came to the city and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derby and we need to preach the gospel to that city in a taut many they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God so this was a general idea of monks them and when they had ordained elders in every Church and it prayed with fasting they committed them to the Lord on whom they believed so Paul's just finished being stoned he comes back at Elsinore with much tribulation you'll enter into the kingdom of God this is how it's going to be for you guys I'm going to speak about Paul for a little bit this is from Galatians and Paul says from henceforth let no man trouble me for my beer in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus and we know that different callings that we have the Lord puts us through different things different levels for the different callings that we have now I would have liked Paul was calling Paul is calling didn't allow him just to have an easy life and here you go in the same with brother branham's nonetheless it's something that we can look to I've got a few scriptures here Paul says are they ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more an Labour's more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent and deaths oft of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice I chef I suffered shipwreck a night in the day have I been in the deep this is not because he was going on a holiday this is to spread the gospel and journeys often Imperials of waters Imperials of robbers and perils by mine own countrymen and perils by the heathen Imperials in the city Imperials and the wilderness and perils in the sea Imperials amongst false brethren and weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things which are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches paul was fighting a lot of battles and he fought every single day that's what we are called to do as well and paul says and now behold I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not known to think that shall before me there save that the whole ghost witnesseth and every city saying that bonds in afflictions abide me and I like this verse but none of these things move me none of these things move me and that's the attitude we should have as a Christian come what may bring it on hey none of these things move me neither count on my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the Ministry which I've received over the Lord to testify the gospel of the grace of God it's how we want to go out brethren none of these things move me I'm going to finish my course now back to what I was talking about before so Paul's going through all this right baby gets back to the Corinthian church and and he hears things about the Corinthians and he's battling battling all these things and then he hears back a report and it's and then he says he hears about all the disputing and the fussing going on right I think from his perspective he's out there he's being shipwrecked he's been stoned he's trying to preach the word he's got perils among false brethren he's got all these things and then he hears of these Christian guys that are just arguing and fussing amongst themselves you know if you're a friend of him like a acquaintance in terms of he could talk candidly to you he'd probably say that bunch of babies hey look at them look at this look at the wool we're trying to fight brother than these brothers here just fussing and arguing amongst themselves caring on really yeah that's that was that that's what you'd be that's what he'd be thinking and comp in the context of the battle that there is and these guys are battling amongst each other and he said imported for are you yet carnal for it whereas among you there is envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walkers min he's saying you're not really being real soldiers you're just busting around and what it means but a carnal and Walker's men where does all about disputes come from they come from there they come from the carnal man that's in us how they don't come from the spirit man the spirit man that sent us doesn't have the ability to hold a grudge it doesn't have the ability to get offended it cannot get offended it doesn't have the ability to not like you to what you get back at you to harm you it does not you think about it it does not have that ability within itself that the most testing that it got was when it was put upon a cross and it was tested and and spat upon and all these things that this spirit of god was tested and yet what was this end result Father forgive them you know how what they do today that's that's how far the spirit can go and still not fight back against other humans against and do anything like that so all of this stuff here that these guys were doing was from the was because they were living the carnal man act and do things because this is not from the Spirit of God and and that comes from not standing on our standing our ground and fighting and fighting this thing down I die daily getting that flesh under control that's our that's part of our job as a soldier keep your land under control keep that going to control we've got a we've got a part of the fence that we've all that we've got to stand and hold and it's our walls you know if we let our wall down we start leaving the enemy comes through us we start getting carnal we affect other people through our carnality we start having these little disputes I can't fight your battle for you as much as I'd like to be your burdens I can't be I can't fight your battle for you you have to fight your battle and if you don't and if we don't then we end up like this and we get disputing and all these sorts of things but perfect love is not like this James says as well from whence cometh Wars and Fighting's among you came they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members doesn't come from God it doesn't come from the new life that's in you it comes from their lust in our members if we let that thing work and have it have it not be beaten down not bring it under subjection this is what's going to happen but now our job as a Christian as if you perceive that amongst an another brother or a sister you know that's not them it's not them don't even act on don't respond don't get something to it and respond in a carnal way it's even worse act in a spiritual way it's never a person you understand right so so now this picture here that that Spirit of God and us does not have the ability to get upset doesn't have the ability to get offended you know those days of getting offended and being it actually doesn't have the ability to be hurt you know that the Spirit of God does not have the ability to get hurt it can be it can feel burdened but not to be heard in terms of I'm gonna I need to get back at you for this doesn't have the ability you know people have little disputes and fellowships and they're all upset about things and arm hmm it's that's not since it's not a real soldier that's not someone that's fought their flesh and got it done it's not since I didn't break it to you so abruptly but that's nonsense it's not the way that we should be as believers it's not our portion the if we want to be like I'll restore me back to what the head in the book of X that's what the head I die daily I'm not gonna let this carnal guy come and act and do things it's this how that's the way that a believer is that's what we've being restored back to you we want the spoken word and that this is part of it this is what we have that the Spirit of God doesn't have the ability to be not long-suffering because it says charity which is actually just the love which is the life of God because God is love charity is a gap a gap oh okay the word when I'm not Greek I'm not going to put in that I am right that's that's the life of God when it comes in us God is love and that this scripture in first Corinthians explains this is how God acts so charity suffers long suffers long so when we used to side I'm done with that person I bet enough that's not charity that's not this that's not speaking from that net Spirit of God they're speaking from this other carnal man about enough God's never done with it he's never done with it it's the way it is it's kind kind it's always kind no matter what happens it's always kind you did this to me I'll do this to you but if you do that to me I'll do this to you doesn't work like that it's always kind it's always it's it doesn't it's not overcome with evil it overcomes evil with good it doesn't Envy oh they got the position and the church that I wanted what come on men it doesn't care your your beer awesome that's fantastic you enjoy that that's fantastic man you're you're better off because of that awesome I'm thrilled let's work the way the Spirit of God acts is what this not itself it's like boastful it's not puffed up doesn't think it's anything great it's not easily provoked flesh manga is provoked quite easily especially when you get tired but the spirit man is not easily provoked you can't get them all stirred up he's not easily provoked seeketh not her own it's not gonna read here sorry does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinks no evil rejoices not an iniquity see all this nonsense about God is love at least we do whatever I want that's not love because love doesn't rejoice in iniquity love love can never ever ever accept something that's wrong it doesn't have the ability to it can't say yes like okay I accept it after all these years I'll accept it doesn't have the ability to accept and liquidy it's like and this is this is something that you face when you're when you're a parent but you know I've had to say - I've had to make a declaration to my children I'm only ever going to accept God and a life that's surrendered to God like bring forth those fruits I'll accept you but but I'm not going to accept something that I can't accept iniquity as long as if you go down that road ever I can't um I will not go down that road with you that's not because I don't like you but there's something in me that won't just go okay let's just yes we have you with that now I won't even be happy with it hey I haven't been happy with it for a long time I will never be happy with it I'm not going to go down that road it's going to be a constant conflict if that's the way you want to go to be a conflict because I'm that I can't rejoice the net I can't go there with you and it's not that I don't like you it's just I don't like that rejoice it's not an iniquity but rejoices and truth and I like this one Bharath all things here's all things to me that's strong believes all things hopes all things endures all things it can enjoy anything you might go through anything in your life regardless of how hard it might seem this love of God this life that sin you will endure it that's what we have is Christians they are therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Christ we've got to be tough people let's that's we've got to be we've got to have that within us we can't be just soft this world has made us so soft so many conveniences and everything we just get everything nice and easy it's made us soft but you know as a Christian Paul says and joy to Timothy endure hardness I wonder what their boots meet because sometimes we can the King James can sort of we can't quite get it sometimes but REI got a few other different versions just to see if I was on the right track join with me in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus and your suffering along with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus shear and suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus suffer hardship with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus there are therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ as a good soldier of Christ Jesus you must enjoy your share of suffering take your part and suffering as a loyal soldier of Christ take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus you must therefore share in hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus you therefore and your hardness as a good soldier of Christ it all pretty much says the same thing telling us the walk is not going to be easy and we've got to accept that it's gonna be tough it's gonna be hard and we've got to endure it I mean they have that endurance of the in shall be safe now I'm not talking about our our our you know it's gonna be by my works but I'm just saying when we take on this attitude then we can fight a bit easier you know when I didn't have this attitude I used to get down about things are so hard why is there to be so hard all the time you know and that would would get me down till one day I understood this is just a fight man get used to it stop fighting back amen fight back don't just just one thing and when you don't feel like it fight back again and when you get booted down on the ground and you fail I wrote a silly song with song one so that the chorus is that all you've got people don't know what it means but I know what it means and I liken myself you know sometimes you know you might get beaten down you're on the ground and you Satan's kind of all it's got you down and then you can barely open your eyes cuz your eyes all black you've been beaten up and then you say is that all you've got hey you know bring it on when Satan can't actually get you to say I give up I and go at his side he hates it you can mess with you any way he wants to but he cannot actually ever get you you'll never go yes I give up you might actually be mean you say no I didn't mean that I'm not and your time of weakness it was a man called um Thomas but he was a um it like an Anglican priest and 1600s and he wasn't happy with the I guess ministering under that situation with just in the Anglican Church and how they were doing it and I think you wanted more liberty to just be able to preach the gospel and do what he wanted to do and and the restraints of the Anglican Church were start it's a really way on him but in those times the you know these tutors are quite powerful and I guess they paid as loving and all those sorts of things and and he was he was facing this battle off you know do I do I I really want to just serve the Lord but there's going to be a price for me to pay if I just tell these guys I'm gone because he wanted to leave that and just start a little under pendant Church and just be able to preach the gospel and and see the Spirit of God moved that was his desire but he knew in order to do that here to pay a price it was going to cost him something and and I'm around the same time - he was he was reading about Peter the history about Peter so this is Simon Peter the Apostle Peter and and most of the disciples were crucified or stoned in some way but but history different accounts from history say that of Peter when they were going to crucify him Peter said don't crucify me upright because that's the way they crucified the Lord I'm not worthy to be crucified like that crucifying me upside down so they crucified him upside down that's that's what history tells us and and so this man I'm Thomas Shepherd is I guess he's got that on his mind and he's thinking about look I paying a price to leave the church and he's thinking about taking up his cross and then I don't know if you can see this but he wrote a song and this is actually the first song that he wrote and it says my Simon bear the cross alone in all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me how happy are the Saints above who once went mourning here but now they tasted mingled love and joy without a tear will bear the consecrated cross till from the cross we're free then go home our crowns - wherefore there's a cross for me there was the original version of the song it changed over the years but the original version was must Simon bear his cross alone and all the world go free over the years have changed through must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free that's this one here but but the the the idea remains the same must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free and brother read and use that song when he was talking about the the lady that had the drunk the drunkard that was a husband and maybe day and night should have to go through two or more when he would come home drunk and call her all sorts of names and and basically treated like nothing and don't know the situation there but you can imagine that wasn't nice it and the and for a Christian lady I think a nice godly woman you know should be at a different environment than there be here she is in their environment a godly woman just wanted to serve the Lord if she's in that environment of just persecution and and the turmoil she must have gone through day-in day-out being editor at home it's not like it was a drama at work if she could come home and yet from it it was it was home it was all the time you know and then and so brother Brown tells the story of the the husband he came home with some of his friends and they're saying I don't believe God's really neat no he's not and the husband said no actually I think he is because I think some because my wife's a real Christian I think God's real and he said I watch this I'll show you so you see they went in there and he said with his friends and their husbands he saw his wife you know cook me this cooked me that do this through that and she makes some food and then when she comes back with the food she tries it he says oh that's disgusting back and they all look like they drunk in there and she just she she didn't fight back from the carnal person right she fought back with a spiritual person that's a hard fight easy to say but and the time it was a hard fight to she she umbrella round and say it's here they went out and sit sit down like that you know and then and she came out and said dear I'm sorry I didn't get them folks I'll fix some more for you all nonsense you know that I didn't want them that way in the first place just carrying on like that about the food they went out there and sit down and act like they was drunk they heard here in their kind of snubbing to herself singing and a real low voice must Jesus be the cross alone in all the world go free there's a cross river road and there's a cross for me that's consecrated cross I'll beer toward this shot set me free wonder I looked these other what I said she's a Christian she's got it they were overcome overcome and that little woman led her husband plus there's others to Christ at night see why I just be real sweet just remember he knows all about it that's how a Christian fights that's how we really fight it's not on there anymore Oh Lord let me come to let me not leave me Oh Lord living never let me come to a standstill continually Lord let me not stop at one thing let me just move on Lord till I have completed everything that you obtain for me to do regardless of the price regardless of the cost regardless of the criticism how hard the crosses remember the cross you wore so this consecrated cross off the air until the earth shall set me free being go home a crown to wear there's a crown for me must Jesus bear the cross alone in all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me I put this up here because on the what Sept this morning I don't know if you recall it but on the last I think it was the daily altar as these times may be heard God has not promised a flower beard of ease but he has promised grace sufficient for a patrol that can hit you that's right yes indeed grace is sufficient not he's on a flower bit of ease but he's promised grace to overcome and every temptation when a cross gets here be Christ promised to be with you yes sir he's the great comforter and he was referencing to the song but Isaac wants to see it am i a soldier of the cross a follower of the land and shall I fear to own his cause with blushes speaker's name and the name the precious name of whom who died for me through grace I'll win the promised ground whatever Mike Ross may be must I be carried to the skies on a flowery beard of ease well others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas are there no foes for me to face must I not stem the flood as this as this vile world a friend to grace to help me on to God since I must fight the father would reign increase my courage Lord I'll bear the toil enjoy the pain supported by thy word that's us it's their attitude let me go through this for five minutes and then I want to say something after that then we're done this is from if you could turn to Joshua 1 verse 1 to 9 get it on there will I get this now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass it the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses minister saying Moses my servant is dead and now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou in all his people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon there have I given you as I see it unto Moses from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and of the great and unto the Great Sea toward going down at the Sun shall be your coast this is such an interesting scripture because God promised them a certain area he said your area will be from here to over here okay so the first thing you see this is this is what you're going to have the second thing you said was you can have what you have a part of that that the soles of your feet tread upon whichever part put them that part that the soles of your feet tread upon you can have that's astounding because that means that you can't just set this aside and have it all it's all there but you have to get it yourself and if you're willing to take a step so what this you'll get that anyplace where you tread this well then the promise I've given you you'll get if you treat here you'll get that if you see the promise says you are in there but there and you're willing to walk there you'll get there and I'll have that yes but if you see it there and stand here you will not get there that's right that's the way this whole thing works unless you're willing to fight for it you won't get it now remember what we talked about the beginning about a fight the reason why is there's people there that don't want you to have it the enemy is not going to give up so you take it they fortify themselves and say we're gonna fight against you every step of the way if you want to take this but if there's a promise saying it's yours if we are willing to walk and place our foot on that promise we'll get it yes that's the way this works and that's why we have to be soldiers and fight because without a fight we won't get anything in this Christian walk we need to fight there is no way that we can achieve this fighting when they got to the land I've got the picture on the this side here is actually the occupants that were already there and I like this label because it's his Nations to be displaced from the promised land there were people already there that were actually disand to be displaced should any of the children the bursar I've decided to have the part of land that they were on it was all divided up but there were people there already every promise we've got Satan's there to fight against it but as sure as anything if we're willing to fight and - stand step forward that's why I was touched by sister Hannah's book I've got this at the end that she wrote Priya's everyday because it it spoke to me like there's somebody that wakes up if your dance is no Amy I'm gonna fight back I'm fighting back I want this I want that I'm not just gonna sit back oh wow this is the way life is I'm gonna fight back a man before I decide this I'll have it if I decide that I'm gonna have it a man she fought back and this that that I think that's what encouraged me the most because I saw a fighting spirit there she may be tired one day and it's got a big day work but she wakes up and fights back to me that's courage that's what a real Christian does that's that we should act as Christians Amy let me read this here how long does a baby cry until it gets satisfied and that's the way the believing Christians should do God's child if you see that God made a promise don't give up cry to what science encroach you to see God's word God vindicate his word when go up indicates as word improves it's here then you didn't have to cry no more you got it walk away and thank him for it until you do that scream out to new get it I like their persistent holding on not a hybrid plant but one there has to be babied impeding impact around Christians are real genuine born articles of God they fight for their position and fight til they finish on this earth every move of it as a fight God told Moses he gave him the land he told Joshua every place the foot or sole of your foot treads on that have I given you they had to fight for every inch of it so do we have to fight for every inch of it it isn't something to be baby competed and around like that and say well I'll take you over there and see what you think about it you pass your opinion there's no way - come come with the determination come here going to stay there till has overstayed each of God answers and vindicates that's our attitude as a believer we're going to fight back a man that believes in God can see the presence of God feel the presence of God sense of presence and God know he's here he's here to us and everything that he made promises for you on the stage being cried soon you get it hold on to him don't leave if you have to stay day and night don't give up a fighter doesn't give up keep fighting you'll get it you're won every single battle of a sinners word you're won every single battle that comes your way your look you'll attain to every single promise if you want it that's our promise that's the that's what's been divided to us God told Moses down in Egypt land he said I have given you Palestine there's a good lesson there for a minute God's Word said to Moses Palestine belongs to the children of Israel now God could have went up there and Sheree TV one of them Philistines and so forth out and then see come on Moses just come up and sit down and take it easy but Moses Joshua and the Israelites had to fight for every inch of ground they got and if we promise in the book is yours but God will never give it to you and you lay back on the beard of ease right you'll fight for every inch of ground you get he told Joshua every place the sole of your foot treads that have I given you footprints meant victory and it's the same thing tonight if you're paralyzed and you can't wiggle a finger say God I want to wiggle my finger that's right you promised me I could do it and I'll lay there and wiggle to like wiggle till I do wiggle oh that's right god maybe the promise God told me I could put my foot on the floor and here it comes here it comes here sport it's coming just keep on something you do put your foot on the floor that's it fight for every energy things that's handed to you that's what's the matter with the American people in US as well tonight we've gotten everything you've gotten everything handed to you well feed fat and then clothes and everything else you've got no need for nothing but you don't but don't realize you're miserable Richard and blind now I'm not saying that's us but I'm just saying that's the attitude right we get everything handed to us it doesn't come to us Satan not going to give nothing we've got to fight for it but we've been given promises then it's ours amen amen I like the story here this is a story of David and if you know the story of David he was God and made him King and David had to fight his way to the kingdom you know he was anointed king when he was what was it thirteen fourteen he may be younger maybe you thought it's all just gonna come easy to me and I'm just gonna end up on the throne even when he when he went into the house of Saul and he started playing for Saul the heart baby he thought well this is that maybe within a year or two I'll be on the throne I think he waited another fifteen years and and when it looked like it was getting closer when all the people were were saying Saul slowest thousands and David tens of thousands right after that Saul's on David's on the run and then before you know it he finds himself out in the wilderness there with a bunch of ragtag men that were renegades and guys and debt and everyone that no one else wanted David ended up with all these men that no one wanted and that's him as a king yeah but but David knew God's gonna make me king I'm gonna be the king and he didn't actually have to fight for it in his own way but he trusted in God and he and he he fought and fought and fought was essentially fought his way to the kingdom but he did one day become king but then you know the story of David he saw Bathsheba there and he he committed the sin with fish Seabury had her husband killed which was actually listed as one of the mighty men he had and he had him killed so that he could have because he'd found out that his wife was pregnant so he he brought her back one night and because he wanted to have her have him go into his wife and so they would be back near the night and he would go back to the the battlefield and then she would say oh it's um it's his son but when he came back he that this I forget his name but he said I'm not gonna go him with my wife and all my soldiers and all my fellow brethren are out there on the field fighting I'm going to sleep out on the front court here tonight I'm not going in there and Dave was upset and he tried to do it again to get him get him drunk and make him go back to his house and he wouldn't do it he went back so then David had to come up with another plan to kill him such evil and and as a result God said because of that the sword will not depart out of your house will never depart from your house and it wasn't long till one of a one of David's sons like one of his daughters from another another mother he had a few of them tamer and he ended up he raped tamer and one of the other brothers that was a sister to tamer he was a real sister Absalom he was upset by this inherited in his heart all the time to kill this other brother and so he eventually did when they went with the shearers and they didn't get along David and Absalom and after quite a few years Absalom came back to Jerusalem through the help of Joab he came back and they kind of got along with kind of didn't and then the people all started liking Absalom a bit more than David after that because Absalom was sitting the gate and he would ask the people what they want and it was very good looking man I think he had really long here has sent us here weighed a lot he would had this big book here and I think he was quite tall and good-looking and and eventually it got to the point where Absalom said to David I'm gonna I want to go and do sacrifice to the Lord in a certain place but his plan was that he tricked his father when he when he went to go and do that he blew a trumpet and he said to all his men you know when I blow that when the trumpet blows declare me the king so well he was gone they blew the trumpet and declared Absalom king now David this mighty meant word got back to him Absalom has declared himself king and David said to his men we run let's run brothers if he comes back here he's going to annihilate us this run and so David ran together God has few mighty men and some of the woman left half the woman there and he ran he ran away from his son Absalom because he said if the kids back to Jerusalem we'll all be dead so he ran and that's when he crossed over the brook and that's when there I forget the other man's name but the son of Belial they call him he was throwing stones at him and said ask because you know you what you did to the house of Saul and he was throwing rocks at him but David knew that it was because of what he'd done with Bathsheba he said God told him to do this leave him alone and and David ran out as a rejected King and then Absalom Absalom became the King and he took his father's concubines and that and then they said there was a man there how I'll just paraphrase us rather than reading the scriptures it was a man there that gave counsel to both David and he was now going to give counsel to Epsilon and they said what should we do with David now because David's run away what should we do and this man says this is what you should do nowadays of the counsel of this man that his counsel was as the Oracles of God he was so wise the it was as though God was speaking to you and giving you counsel say see this is what you should do David at the moment as weak he's on the run tonight you give me certain amount of men to put 12 thousand men him and his men are on the run they're weak they're weary they're tired give me min tonight I'll go there and I'll so I'll only get home because when they see me coming all the people around him will run and I'll just get all our doors kill David then I'll come back he said in the whole of the kingdom will come to you and they all said that's very good advice we'll take that advice then Absalom said ok I'll just ask one more piece of counsel one more piece of counsel and there was another man that was going to go with David but David said to him now you go back to Absalom and if it comes up that you can give counsel you counsel them something different so it doesn't hit me but I'm going to take it right I'm going to take it from the standpoint the counsel of that man was just looking at natural things right the counsel of that man was looking at natural things naturally speaking David was weary and tired and on the run that was the truth naturally speaking right that's natural but I'm going to say that this next man's counsel was the spoke by faith so they said to this other men so and so said this counsel but what do you think we should do he said Brisbane that man's counsel is not good you underestimate David you underestimate David David is a man of war David's a man of war he's like a man that's been like a beer that's been robbed of its Cubs he's gonna be angry you're gonna go and try and find him down there amongst all the woman and children he won't be there he'll be hiding up in the hills somewhere waiting for you and all the men that are with him are mighty men you go down there and try and get him he'll be hiding in the hills he'll come down and kill some of you guys and then all of Israel know that he's a mighty man and they'll all get scared and he says even those were the heart of a lion will faint and they'll say no we don't want to fight against David he's such a mighty man of Valor we don't want to serve Absalom we want to serve David see then you will lose the kingdom faith spoke that yes even though David was there of his own mistakes and of his own failures and actually what they spoke about him was truth faith spoke of David you're a mighty man of Valor he's a mighty man of Fela he's a man of war and there's men that are with him hey a mighty men they're mighty men amen you won't be able to beat them and they said whoa you're right amen and they didn't go and fight him and that's what faith speaks about you and me sometimes we get down and things get us down and the truth beyond where we can on the run and you know like we've failed but faith never ever speak said of us faith always speaks of you that you're you are a mighty men and woman of Valor faith always speaks that of you it never says you're weak it never says that it never says you can't do it it always says you're a mighty man of Valor because that light Venu is mighty undefeatable in your reputation amongst the kingdom of Satan is he's a mighty man of Valor that's who we are we're not weaklings we're mighty men of valor I like that story I've got seven more minutes to say something is that alright I'm just gonna give me seven minutes I want and then I'm closing I just want oh I want to tell you this because I don't like it being on the video but I want to tell you because you're my you're my friends right and we you know we think with the only ones that go through things we're not and thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led me these forty years in the wilderness to Humble the in to prove me and to know what was a nine heart whether they were keep his Commandments or no not only do we get fought but we get tried and tested by God and I read this quote someone sent this quote on the what's it daily ultra a few months ago and I've things made sense after I read this one because I didn't know this was here in America as American Christians God is going to require a lot at our hands because we have the true gospel light and we're failing to make use of it like we should do so tonight I want to speak to the Christian concerning how you could grieve away at the time of repentance for you and that and how that you could be absolutely marked out having no part with Christ by making the wrong choice now these things are a little rough but it has to get rough once in a while to to make us appreciate the Lord Jesus but I was getting onto this piece brother meet me today as I was going out and he said brother Brennan financial troubles has burdened his heart he said after hearing about poor people in India and so forth he said but every time it said I've got good health but everything is just banging me down and I said every Son of God every son that cometh to God must be chastened of God every time we just have to be tried God's what laid on us seemed like being innocent God is doing that to prove that we are sons those who cannot stand chastisement as illegitimate children we're not true sons of God but that man a woman who can stand and take their whooping and everything going wrong and still look up and say Lord I love you that's the one he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved now I love that don't you and I knowing this that tribulation worketh patience patience worketh hope hope maketh not ashamed near you I see tribulations work patience be patient and hope maketh not ashamed and we've got the hope tonight and all our tribulation yet it works tribulations makes us patient waiting to the coming of the Lord I'm going to time myself because my time is up but I want to I want to just want to just tell you this I want to tell you one of the flights that I've had to go through too because we all go through different flights right but we're all breeds randomness together and sometimes fights some of the thing or the testings of God in the hardship you have to go through you sometimes think man this is almost not becoming as a Christian but if it's not hard then it doesn't work and as believers you're going to go through maybe some of you are now maybe it's lining up for you you're going to go through some very very hard things in your life very hard things and the some of us not going to make any sense to you at all sometimes it doesn't make sense and we're not talking you know I my car broke down on the way summer and I here I was an hour late to go and buy this thing I wanted to buy we're talking years and years and years of something that you don't have answers for and it's years and years and years and years but it tries you a test you it makes you tough it makes you hard tests what's in your heart God doesn't just send us out you know unprepared he tries us and tests us makes us hard he doesn't want us to be weak he doesn't want us to just when hardship comes we just roll over we just would give up he doesn't want that from us so he's got to train us his divine hand of love trains us I had a I had a about 15 years ago I had these these businesses and Gisborne and I and I got these scriptures to do them it started when I started them all they all wheat so well and I just couldn't believe how well everything was going for about a couple of years it was just like you'd never must have beat you know this Annette and before you know what I had a few houses and this and that man it was that was the good times right something said to me and August something's going to change August 2007 something's gonna change me being me and not understanding about fully about hardship I thought well it's only gonna get better from here I can't wait to see what it is no man all was 2007 came and things started changing a right they started changing for the worse and they started things started going downhill they just went bad that didn't matter what I did what if I made things just started going bad bad bad bad bad for years until in 2009 I've lost everything was all gone okay but you know in my younger walk I had enough natural resilience to just be well praise at all you know a lot of it was my natural man that I'm naturally quite a resilient person and the flesh right so a lot of that was still the I was just like I praise the Lord you know like I had these houses my last hope was some you know my last hope was I thought what I've got this house I'll fix that thing up and I'll sell it and I'll get some money and I'll be able to sort things out with that then the thing burnt down some I burnt it down and it the insurance was wrong I didn't get cover for that so that was all gone to things like my last but I hope was all gone and even when that happened I said Lord praise the Lord you know now I meant it I meant it and it was hard but still it wasn't really it was still my natural man that was a bit resilient but something said to me back then and 2009 I'm gonna restore back everything that that was gone plus more you'll get it all back and then he also said to that if you know the calling and my life is to make a make a movie on the life of brother bury me see you'll get all the money you need for that cuz it's quite a lot of money right you'll get all you need for that so I moved to Wellington with nothing because it's all gone well the promise is what I'm gonna give to you this is the way it's gonna be so so we get here and we'll then about through I will call it a miraculous series of events because you know when you lose everything when you've got to liquidate things your critters not that good and you've had to just battle things I was battling for years and stuff was just a constant barrage of stuff your credits shot right so you've got to start from the bottom again well then I think it was six months of maybe eight months of being here Andy and I had we had this business with maybe 15 guys and we bought all that was worth them I think we paid it for you whatever it was two hundred thousand for something neither of us had any money right but the Lord just arranged it that way it was a almost a suit there was a supernatural thing the way it occurred the guy wanted me to go into partnership with him I got clear scriptures saying don't go into partnership because I because the guy I said to the guy I want the business we were going to buy business and I didn't have any money he knew that so he said I'll go a partnership with you and I'll just be a silent investor and you just work hard and make the money and you just give me money on the side you know he thought he had it all sewn up and I thought there was the way but the Lord gave scriptures saying don't go into partnership with this guy and and they were really clear scripture so I had to go and tell him I said I can't go into partnership with you I just can't do it and he said what are you gonna do and I said but I want the whole business though I just don't we go in partnership with you and he said we can make that work right so so we made that work okay now you think praise the Lord here the promises are going to come to pass you know it got some new business everything's gonna go well my my my well then about eight months things just worked so bad I'm just going oh this is this is impossible and then after a year I'm comin it was it was almost unbelievable I'm sort of half worse of trouble I'm going this is just a night me this is a night me and they're the if you know the story we we we wanted to see we just couldn't pay all this money right I'm gonna go man I thought I thought this was over I thought I thought I've had my five years of us I thought I'm done but I had to go another round and we were going to be forcibly liquidated right for a $300,000 roughly there abouts this is the funny part of the story but I'd actually the Lord laid on my heart early in that when we've got the business to pay tithe for the fellowship a certain amount every month right to pay it to pair two pair and so about a year later we were like I mean this whole business is gonna be gone a year and a half later it's all gonna be gone and yeah I thought but something um he said now I've actually given to the Lord sometimes it was tough we had nothing but we gave right I've given given given but that was enough for me to say no no no no this I can't see this happen I can't see this the liquidators run they're saying you need to close this whole thing down it's all over you're done man you're going to be bankrupted us all over something in me said no we've given enough to the Lord doesn't do that I just couldn't accept that that this this business could could obey the court that the word of the Lord and do that and then a year and a half later he just closes you down it's something better it doesn't sit right with me so we told that look what I just know I thought of no I believe God's gonna deliver me he thought we were crazy right God's gonna do love me at us we're gonna keep going he said no you're not gonna keep going it's all over for you there's no chance right but he long story short he said he won herself look glad I said no we're not gonna be liquidated we're not gonna be closed down and in the end I got a phone call from the guy that was wanting to close me down he said oh we've written the whole lot off your everything's gone you're free basically see you later have a good life right but it all disappeared overnight okay anything well praise the Lord now it's time to really fight back in you know now the Lord's going to just continue to deliver us right yeah he's gonna deliver a year later because you still got a bet on your way through this stuff a year later I'm at work in Auckland and one of the flooring businesses we had was down south was having a lot of issues episode all this the things that gone wrong it was owed all this money down there someone was doing something that client had gone all funny about this job and it was a political thing but we were caught in the meat grinder between a husband and wife dispute that the husband wanted the certain foreign the wife didn't want it so she was trying to get he be excused to get the falling out of the house and get the one she wanted we just happened to install the flooring so it was all it was ugly and we couldn't do anything about it right I'm an Auckland and I get if we we we read an article in the newspaper about this man that had crashed and died in the wire effor someone takes me she said I bet quite died and he was a director of a building company that we did a lot of work for and he had us all this money I'm probably not going to get bit now because well word got around that he was as company wasn't in a very good situation so so you know straight away we were probably not going to get their money done a week or two later I'm in Auckland I get a phone call from the guy we originally bought the business off that we did a lot of work for he was another so one was 30 grand the other one was 20 he said I hey Isaac hey man he said I just got to read you something and he starts reading me a pre-prepared statement basically saying you know we owe you this money from the jobs you did death but you're not going to be getting it money because we're closing the thing down well then a few weeks of the other one I'm going and I knew this is bad I'm not gonna I'm not going to try and battle through this one this is just so-so after getting a mighty delivery so we had to shut the thing down ourselves well going how does that work you know and then and then you you then you go along and you say oh well praise the Lord will press on not so much about right not so much bounce but you're so I'm gonna press on anyway the Lord's gonna the Lords get a pillow but he's gonna do it amen every time you lose a bit less but it's proportionately at least because you've got less to lose each time you know right so you press on you think Lord yeah we're gonna keep going on us I use that learning things you start learning you start learning about Joseph he was Joseph it 1413 getting his coat of many colours praise the Lord you know having these dreams I'm gonna be you this and that the other thing is all happy you know everything's going well for him then all the sudden he ends up and as his brothers ends up a slave in Egypt and he's like ours is not so good then he works as well after you second yeah working more out now maybe this is all going to work out and then he gets thrown in prison for another 7 years he's going around back here hang on I thought we just were getting out of this and now he's back there you start to understand what they go through after you've been through something after 12 years you're like wow I can see what he's going through there right so so now you eat about a you struggle away you try and clean things up now I want to say this just amongst us right because I want to these are battles we go through and it changes our mind it fix us we need a better year after that we needed a certain amount to clear up this one one bill that we've got and Andy and we talked about it and so brother came here and preached once we talked to him and there was the the direction was we thought you know what if we need this amount of money we're going to give ten thousand sorry ten percent of that amount that we need right because there's these work it was coming to the last things needed to sort out with you we're gonna go Timbers into that in faith and believe the Lord will you give respect what we need for that right so so we were having him this was right before the youth camp that brother cadre dukes was he remember the quadrate dukes you can't write so so now I need to tell us to do you understand right so we say so we're all at this meeting and we're talking about this is the night before the camp we're just finalizing work stuff before we go to the camp and we're saying no we should I want to we need we're gonna do 12 twelve granter you know and then that's going to be 10% of what we need to sort out so we're gonna we're going to give that to the Lord and faith and we're going to believe the Lord's going to undertake so we were having the meeting and it was up to 10 o'clock and we said okay it's almost 10 I just want to get this done before 10 o'clock rolls around because I want to process it tonight so it's just out of the way it clears on the back and then we go to the camp and we just leave it in the Lord's hands so we quickly do that let me carry on and do our thing now a year goes by right and you get no answer your thinking your mind employed you know I gave they're back they're like and I'm expecting these promises of it but I still haven't really this thing is not sorted it's been a year yeah it's just you don't think about it but it plays on your mind and then a year later we had another drama on her we were now smaller now right we had another drummer on a job we're the sky one of our guys can't speak very good English not you Benny another guy and he he grinds a poisonous product on a job because he didn't quite know what they meant we do it all that we'd probably do it all the time most people when you just deal with it but this one just blew up the client blew up and everything went bad as she said I'm gonna have to move out of the house so you could have to get the house blown out with this machine and workplace safety were involved it was it was a there was a drama and it cost $12,000 right so was it with the client we did it for SEMA we're not going to pay you the 12 grand so and we lost half of our work as a result so I'm thinking you're thinking okay now we just so now we wanted that much we gave that and then a year later we just lose that you know now this is this is on top of you fighting every day just to you know you're fighting because you believe the promise but you're fighting it and then so you start the next year after Christmas you start the next year with no work so you're sitting at home and you're going half my works gone right half of us gone now got listener and Satan's playing at your mind that's messing with you you know because this has been now 10 years you're going man I'm sure this is you know and then Satan starts saying in my mind you know what it is because God doesn't really love you you know maybe he used to be doesn't really love you much anymore this sounds when you're in your younger days that's nonsense but you know when you've been doing this for 10 years and sometimes you're getting beaten down you're at home and you just kind of halves the hatchet listen wasn't that better than that awful you know you wouldn't believe it I went through months and months I'll be driving in the car on the motorway and this would come on me I'll be so damn it because that hole that it would just bring me down so much it's actually because God doesn't really love you now it's not like he's not a God of love he's a God of love and I say he loves you she loves you just doesn't love you he loves you very nice or not and I actually struggled to think you I started thinking and maybe he doesn't don't love you man it was I remember being at home once you know know we've got dog kennels out by the front yard I don't know if you've been to our place the Bible says without our dogs you know dogs sort of go outside and this thing is on me for a long time and I'm digging down and I you know and I'm thinking yes yes you just you're open up your eye you know because your eyes pretty black cause you'll be beaten up by all the stuff and then I thought looked at my dog kennels the boys dog kennels and the dogs here and I thought well you know what I envisage the kingdom of God was sort of inside somewhere and I was out put the duck by the dogs and I thought well you know what I'm not going anywhere so I guess if that's the case of this and your agreement that we've got this sounds silly right but if that's in your agreement I'll just wait here I'm not going anywhere else what I ain't going anywhere I'm not going anywhere else I'll just wait here if you change your mind I'll be here out with the dogs you know yeah it doesn't sound like very victorious right but you know even when you're beaten right right right down just like well when you've done all to stand there I'm just gonna stand here then maybe I ain't got much strength this sort of white back understand here you know Hey yeah well leave us if you kill me on a get dragged away but otherwise I just stand you know you know and then you go on you go on you just you know but you got to be tried and tested what's in you when it really really really really really gets really really way down there what's on you man when it was really all the imagine something there that just didn't know I'm just gonna stand then when I have much fight leave sometimes I'm just gonna stand you know and I think I can share this but because this this bless me it was about a year after that that that we know when I was going through that maybe a few months after that the Brahman she had a testimony with me sorry Christine if I say this will been but I want to say it because these things are fict I want to show you the effect that ahead you know when before we did the cadre digs camp that the church had agreed to pay half with brother Hal ray right and and our portion was certain amount of think 18 grand whatever it was to cover the fears and cover the different things right and and we as a fellowship were quite small back then we didn't actually have that the church didn't have that sort of money it's something had happened we didn't actually have it and Paul Christine was going out trying to do work at the hospital and you know to get $100 here $100 here to try and put in to cover it but it was a drop in the bucket you know that the money wasn't there and the day before the camp
