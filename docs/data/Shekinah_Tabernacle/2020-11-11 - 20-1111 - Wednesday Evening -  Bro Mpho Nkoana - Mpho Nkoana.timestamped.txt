[5:50] so
[5:54] evening saints welcome to the house of
[5:57] the lord
[5:58] it is wednesday night
[6:01] another battle with the enemy
[6:04] another day that went past busy week
[6:09] hectic world everything just seems like
[6:12] it's stacked against us
[6:14] but we got promises and i believe after
[6:20] sunday that the lord has just raised
[6:23] that standard a little bit higher
[6:26] because the enemy always comes in and he
[6:28] thinks i might have just one on them for
[6:30] now but then the lord comes in
[6:32] and is merciful and true and faithful
[6:36] and he just comes in and he settles
[6:38] things that that's in our hearts that we
[6:40] need to
[6:41] to either have answers on nor and and
[6:44] that's why we come
[6:46] we come here not for anyone else but him
[6:49] it's good to have all of you here and i
[6:51] don't think it will ever be the same
[6:53] without you
[6:54] once you've met family you know they
[6:56] they're just your family but it's
[6:57] at the end of the day it's all about him
[7:00] so let's go and
[7:02] and come tonight and just give god the
[7:04] glory for everything he's done
[7:06] he is doing and he's going to do for us
[7:09] amen and i think if you if you approach
[7:12] a sovereign god
[7:14] on a sovereign ground which is holy
[7:18] and the only thing you have to offer him
[7:19] is your everything
[7:22] not hold one thing back like brother
[7:24] andy says when we sing
[7:26] leave everything there when we worship
[7:28] worship with all that you
[7:30] have the rest of the world will continue
[7:33] the rest of the week will come
[7:34] and it will go like many before but now
[7:38] is our time amen so let's all just stand
[7:42] up
[7:42] and we just opening a word of prayer
[7:46] i believe great things are going to
[7:47] happen tonight amen i came expectingly
[7:51] i think the lord is definitely just
[7:52] ramping everything up in his time
[7:55] amen our gracious heavenly father
[7:59] what a privilege lord lord we love you
[8:02] and we
[8:03] really do come here lord not because
[8:07] of anything but you that drew us first
[8:09] lord
[8:10] and sometimes we might sit here and have
[8:12] a lot of battles in our heads lord jesus
[8:14] and a lot of things we're still trying
[8:16] to figure out lord but i pray
[8:18] thee lord jesus tonight may you just
[8:20] lift us up that little bit higher
[8:23] lord like those slaves that were on the
[8:25] top of the mountain lord
[8:27] looking over the promise of the sun
[8:30] shining the next morning lord where they
[8:32] are free when that jubilee trumpet
[8:33] sounded
[8:35] lord and they just could see lord the
[8:37] sun shining on their hands and as you
[8:39] were rising up lord
[8:41] they knew they were free lord so much
[8:44] more lord
[8:45] let all of us just go to that top of
[8:46] that mountain tonight lord
[8:48] fly above everything that's dark and and
[8:51] ugly and yucky and
[8:53] and that's against your word lord but
[8:56] lift us up into that heavenlies tonight
[8:58] lord

[9:57] let them stimulate lord where they are
[9:59] lord let them get some
[10:01] some word from you there in heaven lord
[10:04] that would touch them so deep that that
[10:06] revelation would sink that no
[10:08] that they know that they know lord that
[10:10] you have the battle lord everything
[10:12] belongs to you
[10:13] thank you it's a privilege to stand at

[41:13] know of any man who can say he's
[41:15] bold and ready that he can stand here
[41:18] because
[41:20] this place of the pulpit is not an easy
[41:22] place
[41:23] the the sacred desk is not a place to
[41:26] take for granted
[41:27] it's not a place to take it light so
[41:31] we the ministers or the preachers are
[41:33] actually even at a more riskier
[41:36] position to stand here and mislead
[41:39] someone
[41:40] to stand here and not live their life to
[41:43] stand here
[41:44] and and bring attitudes before the
[41:47] pulpit
[41:48] so the minister is actually at a very
[41:50] big risk
[41:51] just for your information amen
[41:54] so i believe tonight that you have
[41:56] prayed for me
[41:57] how many have prayed for me and for
[42:00] those hands that did not stay up
[42:04] but okay i'm closing my eyes for the
[42:06] hands that did not stay up
[42:10] i believe you prayed for the minister
[42:13] that
[42:15] the lord can use him to speak to you
[42:18] amen hallelujah
[42:21] so we're going to read the word of god
[42:23] tonight and i believe we are not going
[42:25] to be long
[42:26] while we stand let us read
[42:32] my friends have got a presentation over
[42:34] there
[42:36] then i will just
[42:39] make sure that i put this um
[42:43] just forgive me stop watch yes
[42:47] then the stopwatch will tell me how far
[42:51] have i really taken of your time
[42:56] let us pray together the prophet said in
[42:58] the word that
[42:59] you can eat too much you can walk too
[43:03] much
[43:04] you can think too much you can drive too
[43:07] much
[43:09] everything you can do it too much but
[43:12] you will never
[43:12] pray too much let us let us come before
[43:16] the lord heavenly father once again
[43:19] great eternal and mighty jehovah
[43:22] lord we are still regurgitating
[43:25] the atmosphere of sunday we are still
[43:28] father god
[43:30] thinking about how privileged we are
[43:33] that you the god who made the heavens
[43:35] and the earth
[43:37] could take his time and think about me a
[43:39] wretched man
[43:41] a man who is born through sex through
[43:44] sin
[43:45] through a sinful way that you god
[43:48] can take time to bring me in your
[43:51] thoughts heavenly father we are lifting
[43:54] our hearts and our hands before you
[43:57] in as much as lord i don't take this
[43:59] place
[44:00] for granted lord in as much as i don't
[44:02] take it light lord i believe your
[44:04] children

[44:16] lord jesus
[44:17] that is why lord we welcome you because

[44:28] presence

[49:48] second peter chapter one sorry i should
[49:51] have
[49:52] made myself print out here because i
[49:53] can't fully see
[49:55] there despite my glasses
[49:58] so repeat second peter
[50:04] one second peter one
[50:08] amen five to eight how many are there
[50:13] second peter one and beside this giving
[50:16] all diligence
[50:18] add to faith your virtue
[50:21] and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[50:23] temperance
[50:24] and to temperance patience and to
[50:26] patience godliness
[50:28] and to godliness brotherly kindness and
[50:30] to brotherly kindness
[50:32] charity amen
[50:35] for for if these things be
[50:39] in you and abound
[50:42] you understand the meaning of the word
[50:44] abound you are all english isn't it
[50:45] and abound in other ways
[50:49] in big quantity obviously if i can put
[50:51] it that way
[50:52] am i an abound they make you that he
[50:55] shall neither be barren
[50:58] no and fruitful in the knowledge of
[51:01] our lord jesus christ we all know as
[51:05] believers that the knowledge of jesus
[51:07] christ
[51:07] is not like the knowledge i read in the
[51:10] book
[51:11] or the knowledge for a computer or the
[51:14] knowledge
[51:14] for a keyboard it's not that knowledge
[51:17] the knowledge of jesus christ is to know
[51:19] him in the power of resurrection bible
[51:22] readers
[51:24] are you here in the power of his
[51:25] resurrection are we together
[51:27] let's proceed they make you that you
[51:30] shall neither be barren
[51:32] nor fruitful and fruitful in the
[51:34] knowledge of our lord
[51:36] jesus christ but he that look at these
[51:40] things
[51:40] is blind can you hear that is a very
[51:42] harsh statement yeah
[51:44] because it has just mentioned very very
[51:46] very important things there
[51:48] faith we have it it will bring you to
[51:51] your
[51:51] virtue your virtue knowledge
[51:55] your knowledge temperance your temper we
[51:57] have ordered them but the bible says if
[51:59] you look at those things
[52:02] that is a hard statement the bible
[52:05] doesn't say if you look at some of them
[52:07] right if you look at those things
[52:11] you are blind but remember you are a
[52:15] daughter of god
[52:17] you have those things you need to be
[52:19] able to use the faith of abraham
[52:22] our father that you have those things
[52:24] and
[52:25] god will bring them to manifestation
[52:28] that is the key this evening
[52:29] the purpose of the message is not to
[52:31] show you how bad you are
[52:33] the purpose of the message is to show
[52:35] you
[52:36] who you are in a bad state
[52:40] did anyone catch that the purpose of the
[52:43] message is to
[52:44] to show us who we are to reveal to
[52:46] manifest
[52:47] who we are in the state which we are
[52:50] currently
[52:51] to bring the reality that we had on
[52:54] sunday
[52:54] the reality of who we are that is the
[52:57] purpose of the message
[52:58] that is what the prophet sometimes
[53:00] despite the fact that
[53:01] he wants to be soft and and you know
[53:03] just calm just polish up people
[53:06] but he find himself having to say hard
[53:08] things
[53:10] why because he who
[53:13] what does the bible say the one that i
[53:15] love i i chastise
[53:17] why would a shepherd go and just break
[53:21] the food of a sheep is there a sensible
[53:24] shepherd who can do that
[53:26] and just go out and break it
[53:30] we understand why isn't it let's move on
[53:33] with that chapter so that we can
[53:34] carry on with our message um
[53:38] but he that look at these things is
[53:40] blind and cannot see afar
[53:44] can see but cannot see afar
[53:47] off and had forgotten that he was
[53:50] perished
[53:51] from his old sins this is hard
[53:55] but it's the truth wherefore
[53:59] the rather brethren give diligence this
[54:01] is now
[54:03] in order for you to have those things
[54:05] that are mentioned above
[54:06] wherefore the rather brethren give
[54:09] diligence to make your calling
[54:12] and election sure
[54:15] for if you do these things
[54:19] if you do these things you shall never
[54:22] fall never and that is a promise
[54:25] that is a promise brothers and sisters
[54:27] you receive it like that
[54:29] it happens like that i mean let's be
[54:31] realistic
[54:32] this is a way to start let's be
[54:33] realistic if an unbeliever
[54:37] who does not know god can go out there
[54:39] and write a book
[54:41] you know i was reading i was talking to
[54:42] my wife about that book of
[54:44] seven habits of highly effective people
[54:46] it's one of my favorite
[54:47] favorite books that i read long time ago
[54:52] and it had an impact in my personal
[54:55] management
[54:56] in my efficiency in my day-to-day if if
[54:59] an
[54:59] unbeliever can write things
[55:03] that will make your life better
[55:05] naturally
[55:06] daily basis how to manage your time how
[55:08] to manage your life
[55:09] how to manage your emotions how to do
[55:11] things if an unbeliever without the holy
[55:14] ghost
[55:15] can do that how much can the word of god
[55:18] do
[55:21] how much can do it of good if an
[55:23] unbeliever can talk to people
[55:26] and the people apply what he says and
[55:28] they change in their lives
[55:30] they succeed in their businesses they
[55:32] succeed in their way
[55:33] day-to-day life in terms of emotions
[55:36] just from an
[55:36] ordinary talking addressing the outside
[55:39] and
[55:39] people work on that and change
[55:43] what can the word of god do that is why
[55:46] paul is there says that
[55:47] if we do these things we shall never
[55:50] fall
[55:52] and that is a promise because even the
[55:54] devil can try to do things
[55:56] at a flesh level although we know that
[55:58] he's a son of petition
[56:00] he's a liar and a father of lies
[56:03] but people because we were gifted by god
[56:06] we will hear as we proceed that the lord
[56:09] the lord even though he came the way
[56:10] that we came
[56:11] but he still blessed our way of living
[56:14] here in the flesh he still blesses
[56:16] us though we are we are living not in a
[56:19] real
[56:20] perfect plan of god so let's move on
[56:23] and read one more scripture what did i
[56:25] say yeah i didn't write today
[56:27] but i said we are going to read matthew
[56:30] 24
[56:31] yes i didn't type it for you
[56:34] but i can freely and happily
[56:38] read it for you matthew 24.
[56:44] we know he died who knows it by heart
[56:47] we know it by heart matthew 24 it says
[56:52] 24 24 for they shall rise false christ
[56:56] and false prophets
[56:58] now this is the time now that the bible
[57:00] is talking about they shall rise
[57:02] he tell he told us then and this is the
[57:04] time when they're rising
[57:05] and he says and shall show great signs
[57:09] i like this scripture and wonders
[57:12] in so much that if it were possible
[57:16] they shall deceive the very elect
[57:20] the relations of these scripture
[57:21] brothers and sisters is
[57:23] i want to link it to our message this
[57:25] evening i want to
[57:26] i want to ask you to just as a setting i
[57:30] want us to think
[57:31] uh the message that the prophet preached
[57:33] he preached two sermons
[57:35] the seat is not there with the shark
[57:36] twice in the same year
[57:39] one before the seals i believe one after
[57:41] the seals but that's not the point
[57:43] the point is uh
[57:46] he he spoke a lot you'll hear as we
[57:48] proceed he spoke a lot
[57:50] about the bride the seat you know that
[57:52] you are the seed you are the bright
[57:54] you are the bride you right now that's
[57:56] why i get so nervous that's why i get so
[57:58] unsettled
[57:59] that's why i almost found the past and
[58:01] said man of god i'm sorry
[58:04] because i'm not just talking to ordinary
[58:06] people
[58:08] and the the more i should be aware the
[58:10] better for me and for you
[58:12] so i'm not just talking to in ordinary
[58:14] people you are not just ordinary people
[58:17] and if you are aware and realize this
[58:19] point the
[58:21] the benefit that you are going to take
[58:23] from the word
[58:24] will be so so enormous because you are
[58:27] not just ordinary people so the point is
[58:29] this
[58:31] uh i want to take an angle that is
[58:33] slightly slightly
[58:34] different from how the prophet brought
[58:37] it
[58:37] but but i'll try to to stick to what the
[58:40] prophet said but you'll see what i'm
[58:41] trying to say
[58:42] he spoke about on you know about
[58:46] how the seed cannot air with a shark we
[58:50] all know what the seed is right
[58:51] okay we'll come back to this but that is
[58:53] the seat of the wheat
[58:55] yeah that is wheat i hope shut up shut
[58:58] up cattle stop don't sue me for using
[59:00] that picture
[59:01] and this is this is this is the
[59:04] stock and the tassel for
[59:08] wheat and you can see this is the actual
[59:12] seed here
[59:13] this is the actual seed but is
[59:16] is is if you open that shark
[59:19] there you'll find that there's a seed
[59:21] inside there if you
[59:23] this is this whole thing everything here
[59:27] grows up and get dry and get bent by the
[59:29] sun
[59:30] for the sake of this
[59:34] this one sometimes you can actually
[59:38] mistake it and then take it together
[59:41] with a shark because you think it's a
[59:43] shock
[59:44] you see this is after after after maybe
[59:46] it has been treated but you can see
[59:47] this seat is not purely purely worked
[59:50] out there's still a lot of
[59:52] shock there if you just take it and go
[59:55] plant it
[59:56] you'll have problems because that's it
[59:59] those some of them some of them you can
[1:00:01] see them you see like this one
[1:00:04] some of them they they they see some of
[1:00:06] them but some of them you can see
[1:00:08] they're still they're still covered
[1:00:09] they're still like this
[1:00:11] they're still like this can you see them
[1:00:14] are you seeing them little ones
[1:00:16] are we together little ones are we
[1:00:18] together yes
[1:00:20] you know the lord jesus said not these
[1:00:22] little ones
[1:00:23] and he was referring also to others so
[1:00:27] this this is this is the shark you know
[1:00:31] and and sometimes if if you are not
[1:00:33] careful you can actually
[1:00:36] think that the city is out of the shark
[1:00:38] meanwhile the seat is not out
[1:00:40] or the sharks have left the seat but
[1:00:42] that shark
[1:00:43] it it can look so much like the seat to
[1:00:45] a point whereby
[1:00:46] you can mistake it for a seat
[1:00:49] and that is why the bible says or the
[1:00:51] prophet chose this message and the
[1:00:53] question is
[1:00:54] why did the prophet choose the shark why
[1:00:57] didn't the prophet say
[1:00:58] that the seed cannot be uh with the
[1:01:01] tassel
[1:01:02] right why didn't the prophet say that it
[1:01:04] is because
[1:01:05] it is because of matthew 24 matthew 24
[1:01:08] says
[1:01:09] they are going to be very deceptive
[1:01:13] very close to a point whereby you can
[1:01:16] actually
[1:01:17] miss misjudge and say ah
[1:01:22] this is a true prophet this one
[1:01:23] referring to a wrong one i can't
[1:01:25] i can't say them by names right so you
[1:01:28] can mistake him but the point is this
[1:01:30] what i want to do tonight
[1:01:32] is that i want us to look at this
[1:01:35] in a more different angle at an
[1:01:38] individual level
[1:01:40] right we know that god is perfected in
[1:01:42] three right
[1:01:44] now if god is affected in three i want
[1:01:46] us to look at it
[1:01:48] sorry brother i want us to look at the
[1:01:50] insight
[1:01:52] because the actual seat is the inside
[1:01:54] the actual
[1:01:55] seat of god is your soul
[1:01:58] are we together that is the actual that
[1:02:00] is what god is interested in
[1:02:02] god is not interested in the shark or
[1:02:05] the tassel
[1:02:06] what is not interested in your flesh
[1:02:08] outside
[1:02:09] no he's more interested in the seat
[1:02:13] and that is why your soul and the flesh
[1:02:15] cannot air
[1:02:16] together and that's the thought this
[1:02:18] evening and that is why i want us to
[1:02:20] look at
[1:02:21] this plant called you
[1:02:24] huh that has got the tassel
[1:02:27] that has got the shark and the seed
[1:02:30] inside
[1:02:31] i want us to look at that to check
[1:02:33] whether
[1:02:34] uh this plant wha wha what is the shock
[1:02:37] what is the state of this
[1:02:39] seat right now huh is it ready
[1:02:42] to be is it ripened to be harvested is
[1:02:45] it out of the shark or is not it's not
[1:02:47] yet
[1:02:48] because the sun is busy burning the sun
[1:02:51] the reapers are here to rip all of the
[1:02:54] seeds
[1:02:55] right what are those things that the
[1:02:58] shark brings the shark brings all sorts
[1:03:00] of things with it it's very creepy it's
[1:03:03] very hard it's not soft
[1:03:04] like that's picture that i showed you i
[1:03:06] want us to look at an individual space
[1:03:09] to see what are those things that are
[1:03:10] really disturbing
[1:03:12] or that are encroaching they make sure
[1:03:14] it
[1:03:15] sits are we dead
[1:03:19] are we together yeah are we together
[1:03:21] right the bride is made up of
[1:03:23] individuals
[1:03:24] and what i'm trying to say there is that
[1:03:27] it it is not
[1:03:28] we don't just say the bride no the bride
[1:03:31] is made out of
[1:03:32] people people who've got individual
[1:03:35] lives we know that we are a body
[1:03:38] maybe i'm a hand or i'm a nail maybe i'm
[1:03:41] a
[1:03:42] i'm a part called the pancreas which is
[1:03:44] right inside is a very soft part
[1:03:48] huh that is why the lord put it inside
[1:03:50] maybe maybe i'm
[1:03:51] i'm i'm i'm a tooth sister esther can
[1:03:55] tell you
[1:03:55] how sensitive the root of their tooth is
[1:03:58] very sensitive if any of you ever broke
[1:04:00] their tooth and you inhale
[1:04:02] your dream cold water you'll know that
[1:04:05] you drink on the side if it's broken
[1:04:07] this way
[1:04:08] because it's sensitive it touches the
[1:04:12] nerves it goes so each and every part
[1:04:14] you know we are a body
[1:04:16] in that body each and every part
[1:04:20] must come to maturity each and every one
[1:04:23] must come to a state of nature
[1:04:26] because if it cannot the whole body get
[1:04:29] in the steps but
[1:04:30] there is a responsibility on each and
[1:04:33] every part
[1:04:34] that is why
[1:04:37] my right foot or right hand is stronger
[1:04:40] than my left
[1:04:41] with someone who's left-handed his left
[1:04:43] hand is stronger
[1:04:44] than the right one like brother andy you
[1:04:47] see like my friend
[1:04:48] apes you see those guys are left-handed
[1:04:51] but
[1:04:51] each and every part in the body have got
[1:04:54] a responsibility
[1:04:55] uniquely and specified to that
[1:04:58] particular part
[1:05:00] and one mistake impacts the body
[1:05:04] right now are we in agreement
[1:05:08] one little mistake or one little part
[1:05:11] one little state of immaturity can
[1:05:14] affect the body
[1:05:15] but the body itself when the part itself
[1:05:18] has to be fully measured
[1:05:22] me and you in our own individual space
[1:05:25] in our own relationship with the lord
[1:05:28] has to be at a point whereby
[1:05:30] now when the whole body when everybody
[1:05:33] gets to the state where we are
[1:05:35] mature now the whole body now what
[1:05:37] happens
[1:05:38] we see who we are then we the rapture
[1:05:40] takes and we go home
[1:05:42] that's all what we need that is why i
[1:05:44] was telling somebody that what happened
[1:05:46] on sunday
[1:05:47] one day be careful one day the lord is
[1:05:50] gonna do something right here
[1:05:52] i'm expecting it to happen one day the
[1:05:55] lord is gonna do something
[1:05:56] and and you don't want to find yourself
[1:05:58] on this side of the line
[1:06:00] you need to be on this side of the line
[1:06:02] so that when something
[1:06:04] that something happened because it is
[1:06:05] going to happen
[1:06:07] amen i promise you it will happen
[1:06:10] okay let me leave it there but the lord
[1:06:13] was going to do something he's preparing
[1:06:15] to do something right here in chicago
[1:06:17] when he does that something you need
[1:06:20] to be out of the shack
[1:06:24] are we together we need to be in your
[1:06:26] own state of maturity
[1:06:28] which means this is the time it's not
[1:06:30] the time
[1:06:32] to be looking to the left or to the
[1:06:34] right or to it's not the time for that
[1:06:36] it's time for you to be fully focused
[1:06:39] with all your mind your soul and your
[1:06:41] body
[1:06:42] me included remember my policy is very
[1:06:44] straightforward everything that i say
[1:06:46] here i'm referring to
[1:06:48] myself and to give you when you grow
[1:06:51] when you grow up they used to say when
[1:06:53] you buy something
[1:06:54] you know the shop owner will give you
[1:06:56] pasel i don't know what you call it
[1:06:58] in your language the shop owner will
[1:07:00] give you
[1:07:01] you know if it's children you will give
[1:07:03] them stocks with if they came to buy
[1:07:05] yeah freebie free good
[1:07:08] you know the point here is
[1:07:12] we need to be able to take the word of
[1:07:14] god so serious
[1:07:15] yes that it will bring us to a state of
[1:07:17] maturity
[1:07:18] and then um sorry brother
[1:07:21] today my state of nervousness
[1:07:26] is
[1:07:29] thank you sir thank you thank you very
[1:07:31] much god bless you my brother
[1:07:33] now i i wrote there in red that is not
[1:07:36] much about
[1:07:38] what i say or what i do
[1:07:42] it's not much about it that is important
[1:07:44] but it's not much about that
[1:07:46] it is about what i say what what does it
[1:07:49] come
[1:07:49] what does it bring out in the end it's
[1:07:52] about what you say and what you do
[1:07:54] daily me you into that what we do daily
[1:07:58] what are the results of that you see
[1:08:01] it's about the life that is brought by
[1:08:03] those
[1:08:04] thoughts those actions
[1:08:07] those speeches whatever you do so you
[1:08:10] need to be able
[1:08:11] not just to to to to to be you know okay
[1:08:13] we'll get there
[1:08:14] but our lives need to be able to bring
[1:08:17] the fruits
[1:08:17] so it's not much about what we say and
[1:08:19] what we do that's that's that's what i
[1:08:21] said just to set up the sin
[1:08:22] why did the prophet i spoke about that
[1:08:24] that he chose the shark because it is so
[1:08:26] close
[1:08:27] to the seat and it is actually the
[1:08:30] ultimate final thing that brings the
[1:08:32] seed out
[1:08:32] that protects the seed throughout right
[1:08:35] now
[1:08:36] this shark this if this is the shock of
[1:08:38] my spirit
[1:08:39] inside there there is a seat that is
[1:08:42] what god is interested in
[1:08:43] but the lord is housing it in this body
[1:08:45] right
[1:08:46] but this body has got nothing to do with
[1:08:47] heaven just imagine
[1:08:50] if there was this body i was going to
[1:08:51] protest but because i'm not this body i
[1:08:54] don't care
[1:08:55] sorry to use that weight but my soul is
[1:08:57] the one that the lord is interested
[1:08:59] in it is the one that the lord wants it
[1:09:01] to come to maturity to where he saw it
[1:09:04] before the foundation of their
[1:09:05] wealth in my individual life
[1:09:09] let's not think about church now
[1:09:12] we can read the spoken word the seed
[1:09:13] cannot be aired with a shark two of them
[1:09:16] the prophet may very clear but here i
[1:09:18] want us to take an anger that says
[1:09:19] me as an individual will i take certain
[1:09:23] things in my life to heaven
[1:09:26] what will i take nothing
[1:09:31] when i say me i'm gonna change things
[1:09:33] now
[1:09:34] i mean my soul me me my soul because
[1:09:36] this is not me what you are looking at
[1:09:38] will i take anything to heaven me
[1:09:41] brother for the real ones the soul
[1:09:43] not this place this guy is just just
[1:09:45] housing me
[1:09:47] the real me will what will i take why
[1:09:50] are other things still
[1:09:51] attached to me that are not going to
[1:09:54] heaven
[1:09:56] why why the things that are not going to
[1:09:57] the barn of harvest like the shark
[1:10:00] why why are they taking so long to be
[1:10:02] blasted out
[1:10:04] why that is the question
[1:10:07] the word of god is his thoughts
[1:10:10] expressed are we together
[1:10:12] now jesus christ the bible says in john
[1:10:14] chapter one he is the word
[1:10:16] he was the one who was at the beginning
[1:10:18] the logos
[1:10:19] right and if you and me not if we were
[1:10:23] in his mind
[1:10:24] which means we were his thoughts and
[1:10:27] which means we are god's word me and you
[1:10:29] are god's way
[1:10:30] just like jesus christ is god's sweat
[1:10:33] that means me and you must come to a
[1:10:36] point where we look exactly like jesus
[1:10:38] christ
[1:10:41] are we together that is where this seed
[1:10:44] has to come because jesus christ himself
[1:10:46] you will see now he's the seed
[1:10:50] okay let me go for what let me jump the
[1:10:52] pictures
[1:10:53] have you enjoyed the pictures little
[1:10:54] guys malacca did you like them do you
[1:10:56] understand what the city is my boy
[1:10:58] that is the seat there and there's a
[1:11:00] seat and there's a shark the seat must
[1:11:02] come
[1:11:02] out and the shark remains but the shock
[1:11:05] is only used to house their
[1:11:06] seat the real seat the real malachi
[1:11:09] who is the same age as me he's inside
[1:11:12] there
[1:11:15] that is exciting malacca isn't it right
[1:11:18] this
[1:11:18] is someone i've just i've used those
[1:11:20] spoken words i might have not covered
[1:11:21] everything but i've used those spoken
[1:11:23] ways
[1:11:24] to capture the thought tonight amen
[1:11:27] let's go through what the prophet says
[1:11:28] sorry i'm gonna turn my back
[1:11:30] because i cannot see my screen and it's
[1:11:32] no one is to blame i should have made
[1:11:33] those that formed much bigger
[1:11:35] now that's why i'm so strongly today the
[1:11:38] prophet
[1:11:39] is now putting a disclaimer he says that
[1:11:41] is why he sounds
[1:11:42] hard sometimes why
[1:11:45] and i thought this would be a good time
[1:11:48] because i don't know how much
[1:11:49] longer will we'll be together maybe i
[1:11:52] could
[1:11:53] i could some way god would help me to
[1:11:55] show
[1:11:56] the reason that i'm i'm so family
[1:11:58] denounced organized
[1:11:59] religion and i want to post this
[1:12:02] in my previous semen i spoke about
[1:12:05] not the previous the one before we spoke
[1:12:08] about a
[1:12:10] religious spirit who remembers that same
[1:12:12] one we were speaking about that because
[1:12:14] there's a danger of of of of having your
[1:12:18] own
[1:12:18] religion right here in the church right
[1:12:21] there in the service
[1:12:22] you find that you are you are a member
[1:12:24] you love the believers
[1:12:26] we love you and everything and i come
[1:12:28] here and i greet and i even preach to
[1:12:30] you
[1:12:30] but i formed my own little religion
[1:12:32] inside
[1:12:34] there's no life huh that is very
[1:12:37] dangerous
[1:12:38] and that is why that is what i want to
[1:12:40] to to re-contextualize
[1:12:43] this point organize religion in me
[1:12:48] i just come to church i'm just bound to
[1:12:51] come to church
[1:12:52] there's nothing saying why are you going
[1:12:54] to check is there progress in my
[1:12:56] spiritual life
[1:12:57] what is happening i appreciate the
[1:12:59] challenges lord
[1:13:01] we need to come to a point where we say
[1:13:02] lord thank you for the tests and trials
[1:13:06] because the bible says those things they
[1:13:08] are the ones
[1:13:09] that do what
[1:13:13] my bible read us that the trials and
[1:13:16] temptations they are the ones that
[1:13:18] perfect us
[1:13:18] they are the ones that actually we need
[1:13:20] to appreciate them amen
[1:13:22] they are not nice but a
[1:13:25] two seed will come to a point that says
[1:13:27] lord thank you
[1:13:29] for these titles and temptations because
[1:13:31] you promise
[1:13:32] that they can come in their thousands
[1:13:34] but you take me through all of them
[1:13:36] that is the attitude of the believer
[1:13:38] they can
[1:13:39] bring them on bring them on that's what
[1:13:42] you must tell the devil say come on
[1:13:44] david
[1:13:44] bring because you are challenging that
[1:13:47] seed to reach its
[1:13:48] own state of maturity you are
[1:13:51] challenging you are provoking the seed
[1:13:53] to reach the state of maturity before
[1:13:55] you know it you are going to be
[1:13:56] surprised on the things that you will do
[1:13:58] in the lord you are going to speak
[1:14:00] things into existence
[1:14:02] before you know it that is what is going
[1:14:04] to happen the more concentrated
[1:14:06] and concentrated you are me and you are
[1:14:09] the mature
[1:14:10] the sooner measured we will get in the
[1:14:13] lord amen
[1:14:15] so religious spirit organized religion
[1:14:18] organized
[1:14:19] i can't that is discouraged the prophet
[1:14:23] it will come in the message the main
[1:14:25] target is not the denominations
[1:14:28] the main target the devil might have
[1:14:29] attacked and caused havoc
[1:14:31] throughout the ages but the main target
[1:14:33] is the seat
[1:14:35] this seat yet that is the main target
[1:14:38] and let me bring it home the main target
[1:14:41] is you as an individual
[1:14:44] glory he's going to individualize you
[1:14:47] yeah
[1:14:47] the devil is going to be personal at you
[1:14:50] yes
[1:14:51] have you ever had someone saying that
[1:14:52] please don't be personal no no the devil
[1:14:55] is going to be personal he's going to
[1:14:57] attack you personally
[1:14:59] and customize your trials yes
[1:15:02] for you say well done devil
[1:15:05] bring more right
[1:15:09] it cannot be aired with the original
[1:15:11] program organized religion
[1:15:13] it can't and that is why the prophet
[1:15:16] lambasted
[1:15:16] and blasted so much because organized
[1:15:20] organization is not of god it is of man
[1:15:24] right i've made a little diagram there
[1:15:27] and some of them is not what the prophet
[1:15:29] said some of them is what the lord told
[1:15:30] me
[1:15:31] when i read the scripture and i read the
[1:15:33] spoken word but this is how the picture
[1:15:35] is
[1:15:35] we know that god is perfected in three
[1:15:37] right water
[1:15:39] blood and life according to john
[1:15:43] first john 5 7 right the bible says the
[1:15:46] three agree in one
[1:15:47] please let me just again put my own
[1:15:49] disclaimer i
[1:15:50] am not saying the the pattern that i
[1:15:53] have put these things
[1:15:54] this is exactly how they are i've just
[1:15:58] i'm just trying to show you a picture
[1:15:59] that god is perfected in
[1:16:01] three right water blood life the three
[1:16:04] agree in one
[1:16:06] that talks about the perfection of god
[1:16:08] right
[1:16:10] body this one flesh i didn't want just
[1:16:12] to write body because the policies
[1:16:13] there's many bodies
[1:16:15] i wanted to write flesh to specify that
[1:16:17] i'm i'm
[1:16:18] talking about this guy sinful guy
[1:16:21] right flesh spirit
[1:16:24] soul three
[1:16:27] ishmael which is who is the physical
[1:16:30] seat of abraham
[1:16:32] arena agreement isaac
[1:16:35] also the physical city of abraham but
[1:16:37] the difference between the two as we all
[1:16:39] know
[1:16:40] is that one is of a bond woman as we
[1:16:42] have read
[1:16:43] and one is of a free woman one is a
[1:16:46] promised
[1:16:47] son and one that's not really pros not
[1:16:50] promised
[1:16:52] was ishmael promised no ismar is not a
[1:16:54] son of promise
[1:16:56] he was a son of idolatry the prophet
[1:16:59] says
[1:16:59] you can go read it he came through
[1:17:01] adultery
[1:17:03] okay i'll leave it there but
[1:17:06] the real son hallelujah
[1:17:10] is the lord jesus that is the real seed
[1:17:13] of abraham
[1:17:14] which did not come through any
[1:17:15] combination of father and
[1:17:17] mother which is your soul
[1:17:21] that is your soul whoever gave birth to
[1:17:25] your soul
[1:17:26] it's not mum and dad no ways
[1:17:29] will just incubate us to bring you to
[1:17:31] earth
[1:17:32] and another one was just a a channel
[1:17:36] which is the father there's a channel to
[1:17:37] bring this seed to show this young man
[1:17:39] called liam but actually
[1:17:42] the true seed of god is the soul
[1:17:45] inside him is the soul inside me
[1:17:49] inside analysis inside fen each one of
[1:17:51] you your souls are the real
[1:17:53] seed jesus christ was the real seed of
[1:17:56] abraham a faith
[1:17:57] seed right justification sanctification
[1:18:01] baptism of the holy spirit wait bright
[1:18:04] baptism of the holy spirit brings the
[1:18:07] word
[1:18:08] bride which is me and
[1:18:11] you sister baker is it true are we in
[1:18:13] agreement are we together
[1:18:16] father son and holy ghost they are one
[1:18:19] they are talking about one
[1:18:20] but that one
[1:18:24] is the one operating in our days so that
[1:18:26] we
[1:18:27] when we have that one we can actually we
[1:18:29] can't go through the rapture
[1:18:31] without the holy spirit that is why we
[1:18:33] need to make our salvation
[1:18:35] sure that is why we need to be sure and
[1:18:38] be
[1:18:39] very sure as the song says that our
[1:18:42] anchor
[1:18:43] is holding no woman i've ever had
[1:18:46] that had a baby you can ask our sister's
[1:18:48] dad
[1:18:49] and they don't know it right
[1:18:53] i'll be amazed they know that there's a
[1:18:57] baby
[1:18:57] and that baby is coming and he's alive
[1:18:59] and it's growing amen
[1:19:01] hey no some of us brothers we must take
[1:19:04] it by faith because we'll never be a
[1:19:05] sister
[1:19:06] but they know ask them
[1:19:09] they know even what the father knows
[1:19:16] right they know it because it is the
[1:19:18] reality
[1:19:19] of the actual seed that is inside right
[1:19:23] so fathers and then goes world
[1:19:27] church and bread those are that's what i
[1:19:30] wrote there
[1:19:31] because the world is there and then
[1:19:33] there's a church denominational church
[1:19:36] right and there is a right
[1:19:39] that's how the sequence is that is why i
[1:19:41] wrote the stock
[1:19:44] the tassel and the shark but the prophet
[1:19:47] says the shank is not the seed
[1:19:49] the shag is only the carrier the shark
[1:19:52] is only the carrier
[1:19:53] if he goes further the prophet and say
[1:19:55] it and says luda
[1:19:57] wesley pentecost but pentecost
[1:20:00] was not the seed the seed is what came
[1:20:03] out of pentecost
[1:20:05] today's word bride which is you that is
[1:20:07] why you are extremely important
[1:20:10] and the sooner we know it the better
[1:20:14] look at this look at what pentecost has
[1:20:16] done
[1:20:18] pentacles have done so much for the seat
[1:20:22] so much i'm gonna try to
[1:20:26] i'll be okay now pentecost have have
[1:20:29] have put so much effort
[1:20:31] the spirit of god ever so much through
[1:20:32] pentecost that for the bride to be where
[1:20:35] it is today
[1:20:36] the shark that's the shark it it
[1:20:39] shielded that seat
[1:20:40] and out of that shark come out now the
[1:20:43] actual
[1:20:43] seed that needs to be harvested and
[1:20:46] that's why pentecost is
[1:20:48] this one the brother brand name says it
[1:20:50] this one
[1:20:52] we can go and read it haga sarah
[1:20:56] mary mary was not
[1:20:59] the seed yeah he is the shark the
[1:21:02] prophet says
[1:21:03] she was only but the the difference now
[1:21:06] with mary
[1:21:07] is this you see is this one that i want
[1:21:10] to show you
[1:21:11] if you look at number three the
[1:21:14] difference with mary
[1:21:15] is that mary she's
[1:21:18] holding inside a part of the bride
[1:21:22] who's that part of the bread is jesus
[1:21:23] christ or if i put it this way
[1:21:26] you'll agree with me you are part of
[1:21:28] jesus christ
[1:21:29] right but mary inside him again we
[1:21:32] always
[1:21:32] sorry i great means isn't it we always
[1:21:35] say
[1:21:36] god is not complete without us so
[1:21:39] jesus christ is not complete without his
[1:21:41] bride
[1:21:42] so mary had another part of us or we are
[1:21:45] another part of what was inside
[1:21:47] mary if i put it that way we agree i
[1:21:50] want to see you again
[1:21:52] if i put it that way we agree we we were
[1:21:55] represented in mary by the lord jesus
[1:21:57] christ we
[1:21:58] now mary had inside she was just
[1:22:01] an incubator the exciting thing about
[1:22:05] mary is
[1:22:06] she did not go like
[1:22:09] sarah and hager
[1:22:13] she went by faith nobody met mary
[1:22:17] she was not married we all know the
[1:22:18] story right that is how mary
[1:22:21] delivered the lord jesus christ the holy
[1:22:24] spirit
[1:22:24] came in here and came up with that seed
[1:22:28] and delivered the seed this thing is
[1:22:30] really today bothering me
[1:22:31] my apologies i used to see people
[1:22:34] putting a solid tape there
[1:22:36] on your cheek
[1:22:42] thank you my brother the enemy is not
[1:22:44] happy i'm sure but
[1:22:45] the point is that mary was the carrier
[1:22:49] of the seed which is the lord jesus
[1:22:50] christ
[1:22:51] same as pentecost was the carrier
[1:22:54] the shark is also a carrier of the
[1:22:57] actual
[1:22:58] seat that comes and that seed it is you
[1:23:01] this bright year that i'm talking about
[1:23:03] this is us brothers and sisters and that
[1:23:05] is why i want us to focus
[1:23:06] on that that is why i want us to focus
[1:23:08] on just those three
[1:23:10] focus on your soul let's focus on the
[1:23:13] soul that is the key thing this evening
[1:23:15] that we need to be able to putting a lot
[1:23:18] of our effort and energy and time
[1:23:20] on that is what we need to be the bride
[1:23:22] is us
[1:23:24] you are part of the we are not complete
[1:23:26] as the bride without you
[1:23:30] you are not complete without me
[1:23:34] so there shouldn't be any the body
[1:23:37] should be working
[1:23:38] with the body with other parts of the
[1:23:39] body in harmony in order for the bride
[1:23:42] to reach his full maturity
[1:23:44] that is otherwise we are we we want god
[1:23:47] to
[1:23:47] to to bring us more how can i put it
[1:23:51] more
[1:23:52] pleasure i don't have a better way
[1:23:55] but god will because we are the seat
[1:23:57] we've got no choice in this matter
[1:23:58] you have to come to a point of maturity
[1:24:01] whether you like it or not
[1:24:03] because god chose you it is not you who
[1:24:05] decided that me now i'm gonna save the
[1:24:08] lord
[1:24:08] yes you did because god gave you a free
[1:24:10] moral agency but god made you that way
[1:24:12] to decide about him amen
[1:24:16] the whole picture everything has been
[1:24:18] planned
[1:24:19] and a pre-planned before to play out
[1:24:23] like this
[1:24:24] that is why we cannot judge anyone among
[1:24:26] us
[1:24:27] that is why we can't be judgmental we
[1:24:29] can rather be supportive
[1:24:30] we can be motivating we can be
[1:24:32] encouraging
[1:24:34] right even when you correct your brother
[1:24:36] you don't just cut and nade
[1:24:37] and nail it no you do it with love the
[1:24:40] bible says
[1:24:42] you take a lot of dose of love to
[1:24:45] correct him
[1:24:46] inside of you not outside saying brother
[1:24:49] i love you
[1:24:49] i want you to change no no no right
[1:24:52] inside while you're still alone
[1:24:54] going to correct your brother going to
[1:24:56] show him you go
[1:24:57] with a dose of love
[1:25:01] enough and sufficient enough to be able
[1:25:04] to win back your brother
[1:25:06] to be able to release him from where he
[1:25:08] is
[1:25:09] or your system you don't just say it out
[1:25:11] widely because
[1:25:12] as i said at the beginning it's not
[1:25:14] about much of what i say
[1:25:17] someone told me that you know what
[1:25:19] before you come to anyone
[1:25:20] or do anything that there's already an
[1:25:22] atmosphere behind you
[1:25:24] coming with you to do what you're going
[1:25:26] to do so be careful
[1:25:29] by saying things outwardly they must
[1:25:30] come from inside
[1:25:32] because what comes from inside is more
[1:25:34] powerful more stronger
[1:25:36] it can change things unlike what comes
[1:25:39] from
[1:25:40] outside and that
[1:25:44] can only come from the soul that can
[1:25:47] only can come from the bride
[1:25:50] an unbeliever can come here or a
[1:25:53] denominational person
[1:25:54] will never be able to produce what you
[1:25:57] as the bride produces
[1:25:59] because you are the true seed of god
[1:26:02] therefore
[1:26:02] when we go through challenges one thing
[1:26:05] that we must guarantee or assure
[1:26:07] ourselves with
[1:26:08] thank you lord i am the seat thank you
[1:26:12] lord
[1:26:12] i am the bride it doesn't matter what
[1:26:15] the devil does
[1:26:16] it does not matter very soon actually we
[1:26:18] are very privileged
[1:26:20] that we are put at the end of the relay
[1:26:22] you know a relay
[1:26:23] have you ever run athletics when you
[1:26:26] you are running in the athletics there
[1:26:28] are others who start
[1:26:30] yes and they hold a baton and they give
[1:26:32] you to the next line
[1:26:34] the next line we are on the last part
[1:26:37] amen we have been so much privileged
[1:26:40] because somebody had to run
[1:26:43] like paul that's how we say it in in
[1:26:46] africa rebecca we don't say
[1:26:47] rock we say
[1:26:50] somebody had to run faster
[1:26:54] faster to pass the devil so that me and
[1:26:57] you
[1:26:57] at the end we receive our baton what how
[1:27:00] are we going to run them
[1:27:02] just yeah yeah paul has run our race
[1:27:05] we won already we don't have to run no
[1:27:08] somebody suffered so much
[1:27:11] and ran a race so we
[1:27:15] have to double up the speed we cannot
[1:27:18] behave and live as if
[1:27:20] somebody i mean we'll we'll just be
[1:27:25] yeah what what's the scripture says
[1:27:28] throwing our pelvis to the
[1:27:29] swines you know have ever somebody done
[1:27:33] something so nice for you
[1:27:35] and you just lightly say okay thanks
[1:27:39] huh it's really discouraging it hurts
[1:27:42] yeah it's discouraging if somebody do
[1:27:45] something
[1:27:46] for you you you you bring
[1:27:49] the level of thanks to that person that
[1:27:53] equals what that person is
[1:27:54] because brother ahman did it for me out
[1:27:57] of his heart
[1:27:58] he just go and put a new chain on my
[1:28:00] trailer
[1:28:02] new i don't have to pay anything what
[1:28:04] must i say to him
[1:28:06] massachusetts oh yeah no i wanted to do
[1:28:08] it also
[1:28:09] ah that's not thanksgiving that is not
[1:28:12] thanksgiving
[1:28:14] that is like i'm just taking my
[1:28:15] brother's efforts and say oh whatever
[1:28:17] yeah that is attitude and we cannot do
[1:28:20] that
[1:28:20] to paul and all of the of the of the
[1:28:24] racers
[1:28:24] that lays before us including our lord
[1:28:29] and yet we call ourselves the bacon
[1:28:34] the top the cream
[1:28:37] the cream all those people that are
[1:28:40] spoken in
[1:28:41] in hebrews chapter 11 that they
[1:28:44] them could not receive their promise
[1:28:47] they couldn't receive their promise
[1:28:49] because you had to come first and you
[1:28:52] must be very important people
[1:28:54] now realize this that you are important
[1:28:57] be aware that you are important
[1:28:59] very much important that people who are
[1:29:02] so faithful
[1:29:03] more than me suffer so much
[1:29:07] and say god show me this thing because
[1:29:10] the bible told you
[1:29:12] the bible told me that if you let
[1:29:14] anything ask
[1:29:15] yes ask it why are we not asking
[1:29:19] because if we we must be asking to a
[1:29:22] point the lord will never be tired
[1:29:24] and we will receive it and ask and keep
[1:29:26] asking
[1:29:27] knock and keep knocking and believe
[1:29:30] then that will come because we are now
[1:29:32] focused into this thing that the lord
[1:29:34] have said
[1:29:35] lord i'm not moving because this is your
[1:29:37] weight otherwise show me something else
[1:29:39] lord
[1:29:40] that this is not your promise but as far
[1:29:42] as i'm i'm concerned
[1:29:43] where i'm standing you said i must ask
[1:29:46] for a job
[1:29:46] and i had a job as far as i'm concerned
[1:29:50] you said i am healed lord despite my
[1:29:53] pain
[1:29:53] you said i am healed by your stripes so
[1:29:57] what must i back off
[1:29:59] why if the bible said everything that
[1:30:02] you love
[1:30:03] the prophet said and everything that you
[1:30:05] love and god showed him
[1:30:07] she showed it to him god god showed him
[1:30:09] his maurice chair a chair
[1:30:12] in heaven he showed it to him because he
[1:30:14] knew the prophet loved it
[1:30:16] man if the prophet can give god can give
[1:30:19] the prophet a horse
[1:30:21] something without a soul brothers and
[1:30:24] sisters let's think again
[1:30:25] yeah this is very this is too important
[1:30:29] this is too important to to to to for us
[1:30:33] to be holding and pulling each other on
[1:30:35] getting involved with us
[1:30:36] no no this is so important we can do
[1:30:38] those things we can entertain one
[1:30:39] another
[1:30:40] we can do but this is so crucial that it
[1:30:43] must be our first priority
[1:30:45] in life this seat must come out pure
[1:30:48] and perfect anything on the way one side
[1:30:52] anything on the way one side that should
[1:30:55] be
[1:30:56] preoccupying our minds and our thoughts
[1:30:57] every day
[1:30:59] we should be teaching our children the
[1:31:00] same thing they should be knowing
[1:31:02] that hey the influence at school i am
[1:31:05] not part of those things
[1:31:07] i'm not part of the things at school i
[1:31:10] am a stranger
[1:31:12] i am an odd person i must be known like
[1:31:15] that that
[1:31:16] i am a strange person when when my
[1:31:19] colleagues
[1:31:19] see me at work they must know ah that's
[1:31:22] the strange guy
[1:31:23] the unbeliever god i mean the believer
[1:31:25] guy god
[1:31:27] you want to come and pray for us that's
[1:31:29] how the attitude should be
[1:31:31] there's this oh the odd guy with me
[1:31:34] there's
[1:31:35] the old guy from africa yeah they should
[1:31:38] know you like that
[1:31:39] but hey this is the guy that every time
[1:31:42] we want to have lunch he says he's
[1:31:44] praying first that's the
[1:31:45] christian guy they should make jokes
[1:31:48] about you then you know
[1:31:49] that you are you are actually getting
[1:31:52] your you put in the
[1:31:54] harvest in the barn your seat is at the
[1:31:57] point where it is going to give you what
[1:32:00] we read in second peter
[1:32:02] chapter one temperance
[1:32:05] virtue long suffering love
[1:32:08] everything will come to the point
[1:32:10] because if you don't have them
[1:32:12] or if you just ignore pursuing to have
[1:32:16] them
[1:32:16] then you're blind you're still blood
[1:32:20] unfortunately
[1:32:21] but we are privileged people to be told
[1:32:26] that that's what we need to focus on to
[1:32:28] get
[1:32:29] our salvation ready
[1:32:32] at individual level we can form a
[1:32:34] religion that's what i've already said
[1:32:36] ourselves
[1:32:37] right i want to make sure my time is
[1:32:38] right today just to say you can just be
[1:32:41] like just like a church goer yeah
[1:32:44] and just go to church the problem is
[1:32:47] this
[1:32:47] many times we we don't want to do what
[1:32:49] you call self-introspection
[1:32:51] right i wanted to introspect literally
[1:32:57] and she sees that she wants to
[1:32:58] introspect me
[1:33:00] but the word is being preached the
[1:33:02] prophet that i listen to the tape
[1:33:04] when the prophet corrects something or
[1:33:06] shows me something i said yeah and i saw
[1:33:08] my daddy doing this
[1:33:10] it's for you
[1:33:13] each and every seat has got a
[1:33:15] responsibility
[1:33:16] to get measured there's no part in the
[1:33:20] body that i know that this part
[1:33:22] is response that that my head
[1:33:26] is response sometimes it can substitute
[1:33:28] my heart
[1:33:30] and pump and pump the blood in the body
[1:33:32] i've never heard of such
[1:33:33] no part each and every part is called a
[1:33:35] duty a responsibility
[1:33:37] to fulfill that which the lord has
[1:33:41] put for that part for that seat to get
[1:33:44] ripened isn't it to get ripened
[1:33:48] no fruit in our lives
[1:33:52] and we don't get worried about it
[1:33:56] we come we go we don't have the fruits
[1:33:59] we don't have the burden to go and
[1:34:00] preach to the people
[1:34:02] we don't bother to do some other things
[1:34:06] for the lord and what worries me
[1:34:09] we don't get bothered
[1:34:12] that is a big concern for the lord i
[1:34:13] think because
[1:34:16] we must come to a point where we bring
[1:34:18] fruits
[1:34:19] in our lives and those fruits come in
[1:34:23] big numbers do you know that one seed
[1:34:26] that i've shown you at the beginning if
[1:34:28] you plant it how many corns are going to
[1:34:30] come out of it
[1:34:32] that's right you are the rivers of joy
[1:34:35] will
[1:34:35] flow out of you that suppose the
[1:34:38] flow out of me you will be a life-giving
[1:34:41] christian
[1:34:42] you the prophet somewhere says sometimes
[1:34:45] we
[1:34:46] give that like the brother ben was
[1:34:47] saying sometimes you give the devil too
[1:34:49] much credit
[1:34:50] you know the devil has got a dashboard
[1:34:52] he's got a dashboard for each and every
[1:34:54] one of us
[1:34:55] a dashboard that dashboard he analyzed
[1:34:58] each and every one of us
[1:34:59] and he analyzed it according to our
[1:35:01] weaknesses and our strengths
[1:35:03] the devil is not going to come to you
[1:35:05] and attack you on when you are strong
[1:35:08] no he is only according to his dashboard
[1:35:11] analysis his graphs tell him
[1:35:12] that ah that one attack him here that
[1:35:16] one
[1:35:16] attacking me that one just make him
[1:35:18] shallow just make him
[1:35:19] okay no fruit
[1:35:23] good fine no problem he doesn't bother
[1:35:25] anyone he or she he's just a good
[1:35:27] believer
[1:35:29] who comes here but no fruits
[1:35:33] no no no bother about fruits but these
[1:35:35] are wonderful people
[1:35:36] that that the lord has brought us to
[1:35:39] these are good
[1:35:40] our pastor is exceptional man
[1:35:44] our brothers and sisters everyone but
[1:35:46] there's no fruit coming and
[1:35:48] i'm not bothered why there's a problem
[1:35:50] somewhere
[1:35:51] i must be concerned that lord
[1:35:54] where are my fruits when am i getting to
[1:35:58] maturity level
[1:36:00] when is my seat coming out of the shop
[1:36:02] when is the shark leaving me
[1:36:05] the shark must leave me we cannot come
[1:36:07] here to church
[1:36:09] every sunday and then you sleep
[1:36:14] what must brother ben think the brother
[1:36:17] spent sleepless nights
[1:36:19] leaving his family praying and fasting
[1:36:22] for you
[1:36:23] i'm sorry to talk like that then you
[1:36:25] sleep my brother and my sister
[1:36:27] or you start to think about other things
[1:36:30] you allow the devil
[1:36:31] to bring it to your mind no let it not
[1:36:34] be found
[1:36:35] in chicana tabernacle you children
[1:36:37] especially
[1:36:38] one day i'll call you by name from the
[1:36:40] front and they say brother sorry so
[1:36:43] please wake up would that be nice
[1:36:46] but i'll allow the pastor to do that
[1:36:51] i'll be championing my my my boundaries
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] but the point i'm trying to bring
[1:36:56] brothers and sisters is that this is so
[1:36:58] serious
[1:36:58] yes because any
[1:37:01] weakness in the system i don't want to
[1:37:04] call it a system
[1:37:05] it you know a chain it affects
[1:37:09] the strength of the other ones you make
[1:37:11] others to pull hard
[1:37:13] we used to to to put donkeys on a donkey
[1:37:15] cart maybe four or six
[1:37:18] in a row three three with a long rope
[1:37:21] you control them
[1:37:22] but some donkey in the middle will just
[1:37:24] decide just just to just walk no
[1:37:26] doesn't pull nothing and everyone is
[1:37:29] pulling man
[1:37:32] people are praying they're suffering
[1:37:34] children one must be restored back here
[1:37:36] in the assembly in the in the fold
[1:37:38] and you are you are just walking you're
[1:37:41] just
[1:37:42] that you know what we used to do with
[1:37:43] that donkey we used
[1:37:46] we used to whip it
[1:37:49] hard we whip it
[1:37:52] until you whip it and you'll see it
[1:37:56] because it needs to it needs to
[1:37:57] understand that my job is to save my
[1:37:59] master
[1:38:00] and i must pull this card full of load
[1:38:03] because if i don't pull
[1:38:04] my mates are suffering if i don't pull
[1:38:07] the lord jesus
[1:38:08] suffered for nothing if i don't pray at
[1:38:11] home
[1:38:11] every day and read my bible every day
[1:38:16] i'm causing a problem because we are
[1:38:18] part of an assembly
[1:38:19] we are a part of a body and one way
[1:38:23] you may dispute me but we are connected
[1:38:26] with one another
[1:38:27] we are a body of believers what i do
[1:38:31] affects andy what andy does when he
[1:38:33] prays i get a blessing
[1:38:35] i get a benefit man so if he does not
[1:38:39] pray
[1:38:39] i lose my benefit of the area where i'm
[1:38:42] weak because he could be strong in
[1:38:43] something
[1:38:44] if armament prays so hard and fast and
[1:38:47] it's the chantel does not i'm sorry mama
[1:38:50] and she does not do she makes it hard
[1:38:52] for him
[1:38:54] and vice versa so we are supposed to
[1:38:57] pull
[1:38:58] as one solid friend draw a big circle
[1:39:02] around your brother and your sister
[1:39:04] the prophet in the book of hebrews he
[1:39:05] says draw a big
[1:39:07] circle for your brother for you
[1:39:10] a big one draw it yes
[1:39:13] you see the brother wants to cut you out
[1:39:15] of the second you draw a big one
[1:39:17] amen to bring him inside
[1:39:21] because he's your brother he's your
[1:39:23] sister without him
[1:39:25] forget about the rapture forget about
[1:39:27] heaven
[1:39:28] right because if that man is the old
[1:39:30] sister is a genuine seed of god
[1:39:33] and is behaving like that it is your job
[1:39:37] forget about him your job
[1:39:41] sometimes things happen among among us
[1:39:43] and i'm closing
[1:39:45] and we look at brothers and sisters and
[1:39:46] say shame he's going through a hard time
[1:39:49] and we forget brother chris that ah
[1:39:53] that problem is not for that brother
[1:39:56] no it's not for that sister it is
[1:39:58] actually for you
[1:39:59] and for me the lord
[1:40:02] put a sister here who goes through
[1:40:05] difficult times
[1:40:06] and he wants to see what are we going to
[1:40:08] do about it
[1:40:12] he knows my seat is going to talk like
[1:40:15] sister haiti right
[1:40:16] my seat is going to say this brother
[1:40:19] will be healed and confess and
[1:40:20] pray for him and ask the lord to remind
[1:40:23] you
[1:40:24] when you are in a private prayer to
[1:40:26] remember that prayer
[1:40:28] to remember that person to be concerned
[1:40:30] about that person i'm going this way but
[1:40:33] i'm talking about the seat i just
[1:40:35] happened to touch this part i don't know
[1:40:36] why
[1:40:37] but that is the truth that we need to be
[1:40:40] so concerned about one another
[1:40:41] so loving genuinely that your problem
[1:40:45] must be my problem your situation
[1:40:48] sister k must be my situation for real
[1:40:51] not only when i see you not only only
[1:40:54] when you come to church or when you send
[1:40:55] a message on whatsapp i say oh i put the
[1:40:57] little two hands like this
[1:40:59] that i'll pray for you but i'll go and
[1:41:00] don't pray for you
[1:41:03] and what kind of a part am i yeah what
[1:41:06] kind of a seat
[1:41:06] am i and i don't even mention one word
[1:41:11] while i'm busy working that lord jesus
[1:41:13] even this request for sister king
[1:41:16] lord i know i'm busy but lord i'm not
[1:41:18] busy in my soul for you
[1:41:20] helps it i carry on this problem my
[1:41:22] jesus i know you can do it
[1:41:24] that the boss called you said yes boss
[1:41:26] you don't have to go and
[1:41:27] be kneeling all the time then the lord
[1:41:31] listen to the prayer because your prayer
[1:41:33] is a sacrifice
[1:41:34] that is why david said day and night
[1:41:37] i'll i'll meditate about you lord
[1:41:39] because the more i meditate about you
[1:41:41] you come down
[1:41:42] the more you meditate about god the more
[1:41:45] god preoccupied preoccupies your mind
[1:41:47] brother mario
[1:41:48] and even when you are working you know
[1:41:50] then the lord come
[1:41:52] in that situation and he helps you to
[1:41:55] undercut
[1:41:56] you know me and mario needs to undercut
[1:41:58] a lot of
[1:42:00] flaws to undercut them
[1:42:02] [Laughter]
[1:42:04] i'll tell you one day what undercuts me
[1:42:06] but
[1:42:07] the lord will just make your way on
[1:42:10] those things
[1:42:11] but now we must be sensitive enough to
[1:42:14] the spirit
[1:42:15] to see when the lord is in operation yes
[1:42:18] the angel must not pass here
[1:42:20] and we don't feel it we don't see
[1:42:22] nothing
[1:42:23] that's the spirit of god one is moving
[1:42:26] we must this is another seminar together
[1:42:28] brother andy maybe we appreciate
[1:42:30] that when the spirit of the lord talks
[1:42:32] when it moves
[1:42:35] we must be able to connect with it to
[1:42:38] see
[1:42:39] but hey this is the devil this is the
[1:42:41] spirit of god
[1:42:42] and act accordingly yeah that's another
[1:42:44] same one all together
[1:42:45] but the point is that we mustn't be
[1:42:48] self-protective
[1:42:51] and let self-introspection i know
[1:42:54] all these things that i'm saying i'm
[1:42:56] preaching to the converted i know
[1:42:59] it's a refresher you know on the
[1:43:00] computer there's a little button like
[1:43:02] this with an arrow
[1:43:04] you know if you want your computer to
[1:43:05] update you just click your scissor no
[1:43:07] then you see your computer going and
[1:43:09] updating everything
[1:43:11] that's what i'm doing here tonight i
[1:43:12] know you know these things
[1:43:14] but the enemy still exists
[1:43:18] and maybe might not be meant for you
[1:43:21] maybe
[1:43:21] it's meant for someone who needs it but
[1:43:24] be careful
[1:43:26] take everything digest it
[1:43:29] look at it do an introspection forget
[1:43:32] about the minister who was ministering
[1:43:34] it
[1:43:35] go and read the spoken word then the
[1:43:37] lord will
[1:43:39] deal with your heart amen hallelujah
[1:43:45] if ishmael and isaac could not be higher
[1:43:48] they could not air together because the
[1:43:49] original plan of god was substituted
[1:43:52] into a
[1:43:53] permissive plan of god permissive way
[1:43:56] that god
[1:43:57] did bless ah god bless the permissive
[1:43:59] will
[1:44:00] remember i said earlier on but we've got
[1:44:03] gifts
[1:44:04] physically speaking i know isaac wanna
[1:44:06] say that i said
[1:44:07] if i want something you know to think
[1:44:09] and innovative i must go to him
[1:44:11] what is this gift he does not have to go
[1:44:14] to university
[1:44:15] or anything i know if i want brother
[1:44:17] chris and he said brother you know
[1:44:19] that there's this land that is like this
[1:44:21] and the seas i know he's going to draw
[1:44:22] it like that
[1:44:24] i know it's his gift so god blessed
[1:44:27] even us in the physical he blessed us
[1:44:31] he blessed us but it was not his
[1:44:33] original
[1:44:34] plan but he's still blessed didn't he
[1:44:37] bless ishmael
[1:44:38] he did but this man is not the seed of
[1:44:40] god
[1:44:43] sorry denominational
[1:44:46] the the denominationals god blessed them
[1:44:50] did he didn't he brought us all roberts
[1:44:53] and them
[1:44:54] billy graham and all those people don't
[1:44:56] didn't they pray for the sick and they
[1:44:58] get healed
[1:44:59] that is why the prophet attitude was
[1:45:01] like that to them
[1:45:02] but it's not like the prophet did not
[1:45:04] know that they are the shock
[1:45:06] he knew
[1:45:10] now neither can the spiritual and the
[1:45:12] natural
[1:45:13] be us together
[1:45:17] our natural must be subject to our
[1:45:20] spirituality
[1:45:21] not the other way around why because our
[1:45:24] nation
[1:45:24] cannot air together with our spiritual
[1:45:27] i'm closing now
[1:45:29] just one word misinterpreted caused
[1:45:31] every sickness
[1:45:33] death that we have
[1:45:36] ever had well if god who is wholly
[1:45:38] locked down and caused
[1:45:40] all these skills by just slightly
[1:45:42] misinterpreting
[1:45:44] one way and any little thing against
[1:45:47] that supreme weight caused all this
[1:45:49] chaos and the suffering bleeding dying
[1:45:52] of his own son
[1:45:53] to reconcile this horrible thing back to
[1:45:55] him
[1:45:57] if god did that and we want to justify
[1:45:59] the breaking of this that's one way
[1:46:01] how are we going to get in anything less
[1:46:04] than keeping his hold
[1:46:05] fully how are we going to manage
[1:46:08] brothers and sisters
[1:46:10] the time is at hand
[1:46:14] we come to this earth the way that we
[1:46:16] come not in the original plan of god
[1:46:19] it was only permitted by god also amen
[1:46:23] like that like he blessed ishmael but
[1:46:25] that was not this original plan that
[1:46:26] we've already spoke about
[1:46:27] an individual level at individual level
[1:46:30] we can form a religion i already spoke
[1:46:32] about that i'm sorry to repeat myself
[1:46:34] what i want to say is that okay i
[1:46:37] already spoke about those things
[1:46:38] i can't even give you the presentation
[1:46:40] to read that's the way
[1:46:42] the people who profess christ now this
[1:46:44] is what i was trying to
[1:46:47] caution you earlier on that we mustn't
[1:46:50] be like that
[1:46:51] that we become christians who just
[1:46:54] look like christians
[1:46:57] you know there's there's one thing to
[1:47:00] just to look like
[1:47:01] to be part of the flow
[1:47:04] it's not everything that is flowing in
[1:47:06] the hard river that is part of the hard
[1:47:08] river
[1:47:10] so many things are in there but they
[1:47:11] don't belong there
[1:47:13] somewhere along the line the river kicks
[1:47:14] them out somewhere along the line they
[1:47:17] get
[1:47:18] washed out the dead wood somewhere
[1:47:21] everything that is not part of the pure
[1:47:23] water of the hard river
[1:47:24] goes out so a christian must be a
[1:47:28] christian
[1:47:29] full stop are we together but you've got
[1:47:32] to have christ
[1:47:33] on the inside of you
[1:47:37] the weight and it comes by
[1:47:40] hearing not just
[1:47:43] there's a difference between hearing and
[1:47:44] listening
[1:47:47] i might confuse the meaning but there's
[1:47:49] a difference
[1:47:50] we need to hear the word of god
[1:47:54] listen and hear it which is the way it
[1:47:56] made manifest or
[1:47:57] it will never mature into a real bible
[1:48:00] believing christian
[1:48:02] you will be a christian but you'll never
[1:48:04] get to a natural little danny did you
[1:48:06] say amen
[1:48:07] you'll never get to death because why
[1:48:10] you are
[1:48:10] not absorbing and eating the weight of
[1:48:13] god daily
[1:48:14] it will always be a denomination inside
[1:48:17] me
[1:48:18] i'll i'm just causing a denomination
[1:48:20] here in church
[1:48:22] in this in the because now today i don't
[1:48:25] think the focus is still really in the
[1:48:26] denominations
[1:48:28] right now we have come to the end of the
[1:48:30] end where
[1:48:31] everything must break or stand yes
[1:48:34] because
[1:48:35] we are at the very end we can see things
[1:48:37] are happening around the world
[1:48:39] countries china there every everyone
[1:48:42] it's like something's just about to
[1:48:45] but but but then how how can we just be
[1:48:48] so calm in our spirits and not like
[1:48:50] nothing is happening
[1:48:51] we can't
[1:48:55] this will just not only be a beautiful
[1:48:56] building
[1:48:58] the prophet here talks about what i
[1:49:00] mentioned earlier on that
[1:49:02] that if we are saying the beauty of the
[1:49:04] church is the character
[1:49:05] like like it says here what is it
[1:49:11] the beauty of the church is the
[1:49:12] character of the people it's also here
[1:49:14] somewhere on our world
[1:49:16] the pastor put nice things we must read
[1:49:17] them
[1:49:19] those things it says one of them says
[1:49:21] the beauty of the church is the
[1:49:23] character
[1:49:24] of the people not the character of the
[1:49:28] system yeah or
[1:49:32] whatever it is but the people and the
[1:49:35] people
[1:49:35] when we say we are a people we mean that
[1:49:38] we are individuals
[1:49:39] my character most character feminist
[1:49:42] character
[1:49:43] analysis character all of us rebecca
[1:49:46] malacca
[1:49:47] the list goes on and on until brother
[1:49:49] james our characters
[1:49:52] forms the church and
[1:49:56] brings their beauty
[1:49:59] one piece of that beauty cut out
[1:50:06] that's what the prophet says in
[1:50:07] conclusion remember there was no mercy's
[1:50:10] promise through a woman
[1:50:11] anyway after mary
[1:50:15] and there is no more denominations
[1:50:17] promised after pentecost
[1:50:19] that's what the prophet says and i agree
[1:50:21] with him it's now we're waiting for the
[1:50:23] rapture
[1:50:24] we are waiting for the bride to rapture
[1:50:26] and go home we are waiting for the seat
[1:50:28] to go out of the shack and he's out
[1:50:33] go and you know when they come out
[1:50:36] they're very interesting sometimes you
[1:50:37] find them even on the floor
[1:50:38] because they could not stand any more
[1:50:40] under the inside the shower
[1:50:42] sorry they can't if you check those
[1:50:44] seats if you're really a farmer and
[1:50:46] you've
[1:50:46] experienced some of these things some of
[1:50:47] the seeds you know like sunflower
[1:50:50] because it's so hot and they are ripe
[1:50:51] they're ready to go
[1:50:53] and the best come and eat them on the
[1:50:54] floor they just pop out of the shark
[1:50:57] those seeds they just rapture
[1:51:02] they just left out when the farmer comes
[1:51:05] he just cut those things
[1:51:06] he just go and beat those that were
[1:51:09] still wanting to stick in the shark the
[1:51:11] farmer beat them
[1:51:13] wisdom the farmer did you see him did i
[1:51:16] show you the farmer
[1:51:17] at the beginning beating them because
[1:51:19] they didn't want to come out of the
[1:51:20] shark and if they are ready
[1:51:22] the farmer wasn't there
[1:51:25] and they come out you go home
[1:51:29] right that's what you want the lord to
[1:51:30] do that to come here
[1:51:32] i don't want that lord i want to be
[1:51:34] ready help me my father
[1:51:36] to be ready for you to go home amen
[1:51:40] rapture is it is the rapture and bride
[1:51:42] coming forth from there the seed
[1:51:44] the word made manifest again that's what
[1:51:48] we are waiting for
[1:51:49] the character of a church is not not
[1:51:51] just a group thing
[1:51:53] no it's not a mob thing you know a mob
[1:51:55] it's not it's not a good we are not the
[1:51:57] mop
[1:51:58] but we cannot approach our characters
[1:52:00] through our church
[1:52:02] because now we'll only be talking
[1:52:04] example maybe we'll just choose a
[1:52:06] brother
[1:52:06] for the ben or pastor but the film you
[1:52:09] know just to just choose those that we
[1:52:10] believe are
[1:52:11] you know and let them represent no no no
[1:52:13] each and every one
[1:52:14] myself that character of jesus christ
[1:52:17] from pastor
[1:52:18] to the small one same character
[1:52:22] so that we can rapture it's not just a
[1:52:24] group thing it is
[1:52:25] a character of each and every single
[1:52:27] individual contributing to the character
[1:52:29] of the
[1:52:30] church it's only it only gets beautiful
[1:52:34] it only gets beautiful when the
[1:52:36] individuals get
[1:52:38] beautiful and can i tell you what you
[1:52:40] are beautiful
[1:52:42] you are beautiful that beauty is coming
[1:52:45] and the lord
[1:52:46] is pulling it it's coming all the
[1:52:49] someone's coming here
[1:52:50] all the tapes you're listening all the
[1:52:52] way all the the testing
[1:52:54] for the word is pulling the beauty
[1:52:56] bringing it
[1:52:57] to maturity they see it and that's what
[1:53:00] we need to strive
[1:53:01] and to push for every single day
[1:53:04] of our lives if no one someone don't
[1:53:07] want to do it
[1:53:09] but what we must do we must compel them
[1:53:13] yeah the lord sent send those guys to go
[1:53:15] and compel them
[1:53:17] he compelled with wisdom
[1:53:20] not fighting them but we must tell them
[1:53:22] that hey brother you will read your
[1:53:24] bible every day
[1:53:26] in my house you will read it because i'm
[1:53:28] a son of god
[1:53:29] otherwise i'm going to compel you even
[1:53:32] through prayer
[1:53:33] you will pray sister anariz isn't it
[1:53:36] michael but i know you do
[1:53:38] because you love the lord amen so
[1:53:40] brothers and sisters that's all that i
[1:53:42] have for tonight
[1:53:43] and is i've just gone over one hour
[1:53:46] 10 minutes 11 to be exact and i want to
