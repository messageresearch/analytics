[15:59] do you know if I'm just gonna
[16:07] everything's got a testimony on their
[16:09] heart please feel free to come and share
[16:22] other Gideon
[16:39] everybody okay um just want to say
[16:45] something small with you
[16:47] you know we sometimes we looked at the
[16:49] Lord for big things when you when you're
[16:52] sick you wanna get come to the Lord and
[16:53] you want to get healed and those are big
[16:55] things and it's and it's wonderful
[16:57] things but the Lord deals in small
[16:58] things and we oftentimes miss what he
[17:00] does in small things so just a small
[17:03] testimony yesterday morning my my wife
[17:07] realized she left a dryer at home and
[17:09] she had a problem she couldn't draw her
[17:12] hair and you know as much as as men
[17:14] would think that's not a major just let
[17:16] it drop drying stand in the wind and
[17:18] made a dry you realize that for for the
[17:21] for the sisters that's a major thing
[17:22] because they've got along and they've
[17:24] got problems so just when I appreciate
[17:26] the sisters with along me this morning
[17:28] and so we we feel for you with the
[17:30] trouble you go through with you along
[17:31] and so we appreciate that anyway I
[17:34] decided I need to get my wife a hair
[17:37] dryer so I got in the car and googled
[17:40] the closest shopping st. there and
[17:41] because one I could find was about 17
[17:44] minutes away so I got on the car top are
[17:47] not off at home and I went hunting for
[17:49] this a dryer for this hadrian so an
[17:52] amazing su Drive closer to the shopping
[17:54] st. that you realize that everything
[17:56] becomes more and more sugar-coated and
[17:58] it's glitter and glamour and the closer
[18:01] you get to the shopping center your your
[18:03] whole being just starts to resist being
[18:04] there you don't want to be there because
[18:06] this is the world full on you know Mike
[18:10] got into the parking area and I I
[18:12] started praying this I I realized Lord I
[18:14] don't know what to look for I don't know
[18:16] wait to find this thing and I just don't
[18:18] want to be here because there's always
[18:19] people around you you know let me think
[18:21] of brother branham when he went beyond
[18:24] the curtain of time the first time when
[18:26] he got shot in his leg he saw people
[18:28] down and he'll and he'll and then he
[18:31] came to JCPenney shopping center and he
[18:34] saw those exact same people in a
[18:37] shopping center and then he went beyond
[18:39] the curtain of time and saw the signs
[18:41] over there and he came back and he said
[18:42] I saw all of you on the other side so I
[18:45] realized in the shopping center is hell
[18:47] is on earth and heaven is on earth
[18:49] people that are already bound and all
[18:52] lust is walking there and we that
[18:54] already free is walking also then and
[18:56] it's hell on earth
[18:57] Ellen heaven mixed together on earth
[18:59] anyway as I was walking I prayed huh
[19:03] asked Lord where do I find this here dry
[19:05] and I walked up and down and couldn't
[19:07] find the right shop and he ain't sure I
[19:09] remember my wife goes to farmers quite
[19:10] often I thought of writing he is a farm
[19:12] I should walk in and walked in the door
[19:14] and I asked Lord where do I find this hy
[19:16] I've got no idea where the hit erisa
[19:18] so I walked in and turn right and it's a
[19:20] shelf full of hair dryers and I said
[19:23] which hair dryer and I could do the hit
[19:25] dryers and they were all half-price
[19:28] Thank You lot you're amazing brought me
[19:31] to the right place
[19:34] [Applause]
[19:53] let's say anything but I told myself it
[19:57] is brother
[19:57] Andy I would just share something it's
[20:00] not very much but um I just
[20:04] I'm sorry full of gratitude and love to
[20:07] the Lord I give to share it and yeah
[20:10] like I I got my testimony a year and a
[20:12] half ago when the Lord meet me for the
[20:14] first time and that was the first time
[20:16] in my life that I knew I was saved and
[20:18] sealed and it was wonderful and that has
[20:21] never left but the last year and a half
[20:24] has been very up and down emotionally
[20:27] just feeling really unstable coming to
[20:30] Wellington and getting feared life and
[20:33] then going home and there's nothing
[20:34] there it's just being a real - real
[20:37] turmoil and it's been really hard and
[20:40] I've just been wanting to move to
[20:42] Burlington and I can just live life you
[20:44] know it's just being that's been pretty
[20:47] rough but and it just got to the point
[20:49] where it's just I felt like I don't know
[20:51] maybe some sort of depression I don't
[20:52] know it was it was getting I just felt
[20:55] like I had no spark to really go on you
[20:57] know just it was just horrible
[20:58] and this last time and like a month ago
[21:02] when we came I knew that I had to get
[21:04] bit
[21:05] thought it was just had to be as I was
[21:08] totally over living as I was I could not
[21:11] go on anymore
[21:12] and and I knew that if I could get
[21:15] rather been to pray for me it would
[21:16] believe and yeah I've been paid to me
[21:19] and
[21:19] the chain broke you know and it's just I
[21:23] knew that it's gone I'm fine I've got
[21:27] total trust in the Lord no matter what
[21:29] happens we I will glorify the god and
[21:32] the board wherever I'm standing and yeah
[21:36] just we have a special study Nelson
[21:38] that's wonderful and like sign o the
[21:41] Lord is leading us it doesn't matter
[21:42] where we are and I'm just so relieved
[21:45] and so excited and yeah life is great
[21:50] the Lord oh yeah thank you
[21:53] yeah which is so great anyone else
[22:13] [Music]
[22:21] I've got a small testimony I just felt
[22:24] on my heart to share it but that's
[22:25] actually a really old testimony but
[22:27] hello you know the Lord has a purpose
[22:30] but so when I first actually gave my
[22:33] life to the Lord before there I used to
[22:37] drink a lot of beer and we'd have a lot
[22:39] of beer and every day after work we were
[22:41] drinking heaps the boys and then then
[22:46] the Lord saved me I already knew about
[22:48] God but I hadn't given my life to him I
[22:50] gave my life to Him and even after I
[22:52] gave my life to my Stallwood I wouldn't
[22:54] get drunk but I would go and have a
[22:55] couple of beers with the boys and just
[22:57] you know as a social thing and and then
[23:02] and then what happened was I I loved God
[23:06] so much that all I wanted to do was
[23:08] spend time in the Bible and read the
[23:10] Bible I just all I wanted to do was read
[23:11] the Bible and I just open it and just
[23:14] have a wonderful time reading and having
[23:16] a jubilee and it was really awesome and
[23:18] I would do that for hours and hours and
[23:20] hours you know here you can imagine a
[23:22] dry desert land and drinking water
[23:23] it was just soaking it up and so all I
[23:27] want to do is was lie my bed my dad
[23:28] thought I was crazy my mum thought I was
[23:30] crazy
[23:31] because all I wanted to do is stay in my
[23:33] room and read the Bible because I got
[23:35] saved you know I really met God and you
[23:38] know I was still doing this a couple of
[23:40] beers here and there and then oh the
[23:45] Lord just basically took it away because
[23:47] I would be I have a couple of beers and
[23:50] then I come home after work and I
[23:52] couldn't I'd read my Bible for 10
[23:53] minutes and then I go to sleep because I
[23:56] was kind of just you know lightheaded
[23:58] and not quite was it because you even
[24:00] though you're not getting drunk he's
[24:01] still you're actually robbing God and
[24:04] and I was fraught I felt like I was
[24:06] robbing God of my might me and having
[24:09] time and so I was like well a Christian
[24:13] can do what they want and he took away
[24:17] my desire for it so I didn't want it
[24:20] anymore
[24:20] I don't have a thirst for it and it was
[24:22] just a social thing I said oh well
[24:24] there's no point in doing this if every
[24:25] time I drink even one I'm gonna just
[24:27] fall asleep and all I wanted to do was
[24:29] spend time with them yeah so that was
[24:32] that was my story
[24:34] yeah so praise the Lord Amen sister
[24:45] Mufti please come and share your song
[29:38] [Applause]
[30:00] god bless you Oh these last few weeks
[30:06] we've had great turmoil and trials and
[30:13] but it was all for God's glory you know
[30:17] when God brings you to a place where you
[30:19] praise him for the trials it is a very
[30:23] good place to be in and I thought too
[30:26] brother Gideon yesterday about it and
[30:28] it's really a very good place to be in
[30:31] it's very blessed the most amazing thing
[30:38] is that our friends came to church and
[30:44] it was not about going to church ever
[30:46] that's not the point the point is about
[30:49] witnessing God and seeing God in our
[30:53] lives and and there was this amazing
[30:59] thing where we you know we had to go to
[31:01] some lawyers basically and our friends
[31:06] went there had a meeting and when they
[31:08] came here to this church they heard
[31:13] father been saying exactly what the
[31:16] lawyer said
[31:16] and to them there was such a witness of
[31:20] God and to us well it was such a rejoice
[31:23] and and from that point on you don't
[31:26] even care what the outcome is gonna be
[31:28] you know you just let God deal with
[31:31] everything and let God you know it's
[31:35] like watching a video I didn't you know
[31:37] watching your life and say what God is
[31:40] going to do and and you've come to that
[31:43] point you know you thank God for being
[31:46] in that point you know sometimes God's
[31:49] shakes things and puts everything back
[31:51] to where it's supposed to be in the on
[31:54] his solid foundation or ours and you
[31:58] know it's the best place to be and we
[32:01] thank God for this the trials are not
[32:04] important at all they don't matter what
[32:07] matters is God and there is no end to
[32:10] him either like what we witness
[32:13] it's a great thing but it's the
[32:15] beginning and there's no end to him he's
[32:18] infinite this there's more and more than
[32:22] we can get of God every day we thank you
[32:25] for it
[32:26] Oh bless you

[51:30] praise and thanksgiving back to you
[51:32] father we want to just ask these things
[51:34] in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen let's
[51:38] just go to the scripture and we'll go to
[51:40] Matthew 27 and I want to entitle this
[51:44] this morning my Thanksgiving my
[51:47] Thanksgiving Alleluia we have a lot to
[51:50] be thankful for
[51:52] and I was I was just looking at this
[51:57] last night of thought I don't have time
[51:58] that's why we'll have eternity to praise
[52:01] Him I mean cuz I've got a lot to be
[52:03] thankful for now this may seem like
[52:05] strange scripture to read from but we
[52:09] have in Matthew 27 and we're going to
[52:10] read verses 62 and we're gonna read down
[52:13] to verse 66 and then we've got to go to
[52:17] Micah chapter 7 you can have your seats
[52:22] after we finish reading here in Matthew
[52:23] it says now the next day that followed
[52:25] the day of the preparation the chief
[52:28] priests and Pharisees came together unto
[52:30] Pilate saying sir we remember that that
[52:33] deceiver said while he was yet alive
[52:36] after three days I'll rise again command
[52:39] therefore that the simple could be made
[52:41] sure until the third day least his
[52:43] disciples come by night and steal him
[52:45] away and say unto the people he has
[52:47] risen from the dead so that the last
[52:50] error shall be worse than the first
[52:54] Pilate said unto them ye have a watch go
[52:59] your way make it as sure as you can so
[53:03] they went and made the sepulchre sure
[53:05] sealing the stone and setting a watch
[53:08] Amen may the Lord bless us would you may
[53:10] have your seats and when I read that I
[53:13] was thinking good luck good luck to you
[53:16] trying to do that and let's go to Micah
[53:18] chapter 7 and we're going to read two
[53:20] verses from Micah 7 maybe we'll just put
[53:23] it on the screen here it says and this
[53:27] is a very precious scripture to me
[53:30] because we have an enemy but he's
[53:34] defeated it says therefore I will look
[53:40] unto the Lord I will wait for the God of
[53:42] my salvation my God will hear me rejoice
[53:45] not against me own mine enemy when I
[53:47] fall I shall arise when I sit and
[53:50] darkness the Lord shall be light unto me
[53:53] a mint now we read there and and Matthew
[53:59] chapter 27 where where Jesus had they
[54:03] had crucified him they had put his body
[54:05] was placed in the tomb and then the
[54:07] scribes and Pharisees the religious
[54:09] order of the churches that they were
[54:12] worried that that the disciples would
[54:15] steal his body away so they go to hear
[54:18] it and they
[54:19] they and they say you know we need some
[54:21] soldiers we need to seal this tomb we
[54:24] need to make sure his body cannot be
[54:25] taken by night because if his body is
[54:28] taken then the disciples will say that
[54:30] you know he has risen and they even said
[54:33] that he is a deceiver
[54:34] it's amazing actually the deceivers were
[54:37] accusing the righteous one of being the
[54:39] deceiver and how true it even is today
[54:41] because brother Branham says it and
[54:44] we'll come to it later when he speaks of
[54:46] when he preaches it as the rising of the
[54:47] Sun and it's more than a sermon if you
[54:50] haven't heard that it is the rising of
[54:51] the Sun recently
[54:52] you should go listen because it's not a
[54:54] sermon it's a declaration I mean the Sun
[54:57] has risen hallelujah is not talking
[54:59] about the natural sunlight and he's
[55:00] talking about the supernatural son of
[55:02] God amen his his son has risen
[55:04] hallelujah he's been he was in a tomb
[55:07] Amen a denominational to him for nearly
[55:10] 2,000 years I mean but the devil
[55:12] couldn't stop him from rising hallelujah
[55:15] he couldn't stop him rising in the first
[55:16] resurrection amen and he couldn't stop
[55:19] him rising out of history in this hour
[55:20] hallelujah and he couldn't stop you
[55:23] rising I mean because brother Bram says
[55:25] what a resurrection that was this is
[55:28] what a resurrection this is I mean were
[55:30] a people who are dead I mean their
[55:32] bodies were their lives are sealed away
[55:34] you're the devil had a tomb for you I
[55:36] mean even before you were born he had a
[55:38] term for you hallelujah any and he had
[55:40] it prepared I mean he had some God
[55:43] sitting over that term he and a bunch of
[55:44] devils over your life hallelujah to keep
[55:46] you in that tomb and it was sealed by a
[55:48] sealed holy because he because he said
[55:51] to God your children will not come forth
[55:54] Amen she will not be redeemed your
[55:56] children will not come forth hallelujah
[55:58] because Jesus said all of the father has
[56:00] given me will come to me
[56:02] amen in the devil heard that he said
[56:04] they will not come to you I mean they
[56:06] will not he's determined that you will
[56:08] not and he wants to keep you if he can
[56:10] keep your religious he'll keep your
[56:11] religious I mean if you'll keep you with
[56:13] a bit of religion and a few courts and a
[56:15] few scriptures he'll keep you that way
[56:17] amen you know the devil doesn't care how
[56:20] religious you are I mean but you got to
[56:23] be totally separated to God I'm in this
[56:25] message as a total deliverance it's a
[56:28] total separation to our Lord hallelujah
[56:31] we're not called just to carry around
[56:33] worldly atmosphere around us I mean this
[56:36] this gospel could not be made nice for
[56:38] the world
[56:38] it cannot be made like an Instagram
[56:41] photo wherever anything looks good it
[56:42] could not be made niceness messages
[56:44] never been made good yo was never
[56:46] palatable to the world
[56:47] it was never palatable in Jesus's day
[56:50] here was the resurrection of life
[56:52] standing upon the earth and they hated
[56:54] him the churches didn't say isn't this
[56:56] lovely
[56:56] and he calls Lazarus from the grave and
[56:59] they got even angrier and they wanted
[57:01] even to kill Lazarus I mean here was a
[57:04] for a god that led them out of Egypt was
[57:06] now in flesh and he was gathering his
[57:08] children amen and the religion they had
[57:11] couldn't couldn't set Legion free I mean
[57:14] couldn't set the woman at the well free
[57:16] maybe she learned a whole bunch of
[57:17] psychology but the psychology didn't do
[57:20] anything for her maybe some nice you
[57:22] know positive thinking and you know
[57:23] you're on your journey and this is how
[57:25] things are but you're stuck she was
[57:28] stuck in a tomb she couldn't be freed
[57:30] but then the resurrection came her way
[57:33] hallelujah and that man problems she had
[57:35] amen
[57:36] it was gone I mean she wasn't bound by
[57:39] that anymore and they hated him the head
[57:42] of the Resurrection same thing today you
[57:46] know I need whoa well you know the place
[57:50] where where I had my 30th birthday so
[57:53] after that my wife goes to give the key
[57:56] back and then the the janitor or whoever
[57:59] gave us the key he said he said to my
[58:01] wife you know if I knew you're from this
[58:03] church we'd never have hired it to you
[58:06] what prejudice you know bit but why is
[58:10] that because they hate the life they
[58:15] actually hate it that's why you you know
[58:17] we can talk about the cross and that's
[58:19] my Thanksgiving I'm free I mean what
[58:23] what he did for me that day it's
[58:26] manifested in me
[58:27] I mean I'm free hallelujah and I'm
[58:30] actually free not partially free I think
[58:33] I'm free I'm free hallelujah he paid my
[58:36] freedom and I've walked out under that
[58:38] freedom hallelujah but you know you can
[58:41] talk about Calvary - yeah you can talk
[58:43] about what God did in the past anyone
[58:44] you can have good fellowship
[58:46] and it can even be special but then you
[58:48] come down to the cellar where is he
[58:51] today where is he today and they say
[58:54] away with such people
[58:55] you're a you're in a cult you're in a
[58:58] sect and I was thinking you know I think
[59:02] it's the Catholic people is the system
[59:03] that holds them back but they literally
[59:05] believe when they take the communion
[59:06] that when the priest blesses it praise
[59:09] for it and literally turns into his
[59:12] flesh and turns into his blood and they
[59:15] literally if they really believe what
[59:16] they're doing they're eating human flesh
[59:18] and they're drinking human blood now
[59:21] that's crazy
[59:22] that's crazy but yet they will say these
[59:25] people are in a cult and they believe
[59:27] they're eating human flesh and drinking
[59:28] human blood and it's accepted in the
[59:31] world this world has gone mad but it was
[59:37] crazy it was crazy when Jesus came the
[59:39] first time came the first time they see
[59:41] it away with such a fellow but yet they
[59:44] had to acknowledge we know that you're a
[59:45] teacher come from God because no man can
[59:48] do these things and this God is with
[59:50] them but they had to make their choice
[59:51] and they held on to their tomb you don't
[59:55] have to hold on to your tomb doesn't
[59:58] matter I'm not speaking against people
[1:00:00] but it's spirits that hold people back
[1:00:01] it's spirits that bind they even maybe
[1:00:04] want to be free but something eminence
[1:00:05] did you they just want to hold onto
[1:00:06] their safety zone you know the Stockholm
[1:00:09] Syndrome where they with a with a
[1:00:10] hostage action because to love the one
[1:00:12] who kidnapped them and it's the same
[1:00:14] thing actually in the spiritual world
[1:00:16] where people begin to love the devil
[1:00:17] that's bound them and they don't realize
[1:00:19] you know but they're but they kept
[1:00:22] they've actually loved the one who wants
[1:00:23] to destroy them we're not mean to love
[1:00:27] the devil friends we're free
[1:00:31] I trust you're free I mean that when you
[1:00:34] walk into a place I mean it doesn't
[1:00:36] matter if you're accepted or rejected if
[1:00:39] the master of the house was called
[1:00:40] Beelzebub how much more the ones under
[1:00:43] him this message can never be made
[1:00:46] polished up to be palatable to the world
[1:00:48] it was never in the first you know Paul
[1:00:51] went to a certain city and and and the
[1:00:55] juicy term there you know what is this
[1:00:58] what is this
[1:00:59] this this GTO what is this cult of the
[1:01:02] sick that's risen up weren't spoken evil
[1:01:05] off everywhere they they weren't
[1:01:08] rejoicing you know the Jews and that
[1:01:10] they weren't rejoicing they weren't
[1:01:13] happy they want to hold on to their
[1:01:14] synagogue
[1:01:15] we'll keep our forum will keep our
[1:01:16] religion we'll keep our old ways what
[1:01:20] did their old ways do it didn't help
[1:01:22] them any but it was a tomb it was
[1:01:25] actually a tomb and here was the one who
[1:01:28] he was the one who came I'll take you
[1:01:30] out of the tomb amen when the when the
[1:01:34] when the when the when the stone was
[1:01:36] rolled away we you know we didn't read
[1:01:39] it but you read there I think it is a
[1:01:40] Matthew 28 the angel loved the sins and
[1:01:43] the stone rolls away and the guards fall
[1:01:46] as did men howl ouya and has to be the
[1:01:49] same thing for you
[1:01:51] you can't get out yourself you can
[1:01:53] plaster the inside of your tomb with all
[1:01:55] the nice nice quotes and nice things of
[1:01:58] you know around but unless God takes
[1:02:00] rolls a stone away but you've got to be
[1:02:03] willing to let it go you can't take your
[1:02:05] tomb with you doesn't matter how
[1:02:07] comfortable it is how how how nice
[1:02:09] interior maybe there's a lot of amazing
[1:02:12] tombs in the world you go look at the
[1:02:14] your the Pharaohs and all their things
[1:02:17] and there's incredible terms in the
[1:02:19] world I don't want to live in a tomb
[1:02:21] doesn't matter how nice it is how
[1:02:23] comfortable it may be I don't want to be
[1:02:25] weird if us I mean because when Jesus
[1:02:28] goes to a place I mean death has to flee
[1:02:31] because now there is life Alleluia
[1:02:35] so I trust you can rejoice with me if
[1:02:39] you've really been separated to the Lord
[1:02:41] you've come out you've heard a voice and
[1:02:44] something and you said I must go in
[1:02:47] spite of how you feel about it yeah you
[1:02:49] know when God moves we don't go by
[1:02:52] feeling I feel good so I'll follow I
[1:02:54] don't feel good so I won't it goes
[1:02:56] beyond how you feel because nothing
[1:02:58] wants to die do you think when when you
[1:03:00] go kill a lamb and you're gonna you're
[1:03:02] going to bribe the Slam do you think the
[1:03:04] Lambs going I'm so happy I can die
[1:03:07] it's not it's not trying to run towards
[1:03:10] where you gonna kill it it doesn't
[1:03:13] rejoice saying oh I'm so happy I can die
[1:03:15] today no wants to live it wants to live
[1:03:19] it doesn't want to die it doesn't want
[1:03:20] to give its life how much more a
[1:03:22] believer I don't want it
[1:03:24] nothing wants to die and this doesn't
[1:03:28] give you a happy feeling gives you you
[1:03:31] know what I mean but we don't you've got
[1:03:33] to go beyond how you feel because your
[1:03:35] term can feel good your term can feel
[1:03:38] nice I'm used to this place I don't know
[1:03:42] about what's out there in some sunlight
[1:03:44] it's all sealed up I know this
[1:03:47] atmosphere I'm used to this atmosphere
[1:03:49] it's a gloom of a tomb it's in darkness
[1:03:52] there's what we're born into but then
[1:03:55] the angel comes our trustees come to you
[1:03:58] and he's broken the seal and he's broken
[1:04:01] that seal of whatever the devil tried to
[1:04:02] seal you and Worth and all the Devils
[1:04:05] were scattered I mean that's why when
[1:04:07] the Gospels preached a war happens I
[1:04:09] mean because people come in doesn't
[1:04:11] matter you and the devil tries to attach
[1:04:13] himself to people whisper in your ear
[1:04:15] distract you make you think about all
[1:04:17] different kinds of things reasoning
[1:04:19] starts to go cast it off
[1:04:21] I mean cast it off I mean the preacher
[1:04:23] thing you know the Gospels mean to cast
[1:04:25] the devil away from a people that they
[1:04:26] can receive the promise I mean that's
[1:04:29] what's meant to happen there's a battle
[1:04:31] going on here friends you can be sitting
[1:04:33] as still as a stone what's going on in
[1:04:36] here you've got to accept it in here
[1:04:38] before it can be accepted in here and
[1:04:40] it's got to come through your reasoning
[1:04:42] and if your reasoning is now I'm going
[1:04:44] to hold on to my old life because I know
[1:04:46] what my old life was all about I'd get
[1:04:48] rid of that press the delete button get
[1:04:50] rid of it
[1:04:50] don't put it in the recycling bin cuz
[1:04:52] you can you can bring that back you got
[1:04:54] to delete it hallelujah
[1:04:57] you got to delete that thing now we're
[1:05:02] living in a resurrection hour I mean if
[1:05:05] you were we were once maybe I'll just
[1:05:08] put it up we're gonna jump we'll come
[1:05:11] back Ephesians 2 and 1
[1:05:17] we are we have been resurrected this
[1:05:21] body hasn't been changed but we were
[1:05:23] actually born dead
[1:05:25] we had a life but it's not eternal life
[1:05:28] it's not eternal / it's very different
[1:05:30] eternal life and natural life two
[1:05:33] different two very different things so
[1:05:35] we're actually born dead
[1:05:36] oh you what do you mean I cried you're
[1:05:39] they make you know maybe gave me a speck
[1:05:42] I started crying and I breathed my first
[1:05:44] breath and now but eternally you didn't

[1:09:42] dealing with me such a strong conviction
[1:09:43] came over me I'm studying like organic
[1:09:45] chemistry and this conviction came upon
[1:09:48] me and the Lord said if you died without
[1:09:50] the Holy Ghost right now you'd be lost
[1:09:52] so I went home and I laid it all down I
[1:09:55] mean I didn't have to work out well do I
[1:09:57] have to do this too after this I just
[1:09:59] came to the point Lord take me put me on
[1:10:02] your wheel take everything this country
[1:10:04] of your word out of means that you can
[1:10:06] dwell in me I didn't work out what I had
[1:10:08] to give up and not give up and keeping
[1:10:10] whatever he did it Amen because we are
[1:10:14] not our own workmanship oh I'm just
[1:10:17] working through this no you got to give
[1:10:19] it to the one who can because good God's
[1:10:21] patient but his patience does run out
[1:10:24] but he's there in sight he done yet are
[1:10:27] you done yet
[1:10:28] I fail Lord help me he says ain't done

[1:10:38] the conclusion I'm done I can't do this
[1:10:41] hallelujah and he gives you overcoming
[1:10:44] power Amen if I lived in I seen this
[1:10:49] before I lived in a brewery
[1:10:52] I'd be sober if I lived in a computer
[1:10:56] game shop none of those games would get
[1:10:58] played a man if I lived in a music shop
[1:11:01] none of that music in there would be
[1:11:03] played hallelujah a man if I had you
[1:11:07] know you know what I mean and I don't
[1:11:09] have to keep myself yo now I can't and
[1:11:13] now I'm scared and how am I gonna
[1:11:15] survive the day no the desire wheat and
[1:11:18] he filled the desire there's not some
[1:11:21] big void
[1:11:22] I trusted you say what a Thanksgiving a
[1:11:24] many fills the void hallelujah with far
[1:11:26] greater things I don't want to play
[1:11:29] around with the devil's thinks what's it
[1:11:32] gonna give me it's gonna give me a
[1:11:34] burning lake of fire that's the reward I
[1:11:37] mean but with a reward of following
[1:11:38] Jesus Christ in this hour as is an
[1:11:40] eternal I mean there's an eternal reward
[1:11:42] I mean we've got to have we've got to
[1:11:45] value the reward because if you value
[1:11:47] the reward of what you shall receive
[1:11:49] I mean it it's worth it all I mean
[1:11:51] because work cuz labor without reward it
[1:11:53] becomes a burden
[1:11:55] I mean but if you could just see that
[1:11:56] eternal home I meant that were going to
[1:11:59] every battle every inch of the way will
[1:12:01] be worth it
[1:12:02] hallelujah Jesus saw the reward of going
[1:12:05] to the cross the joy that was set before
[1:12:07] him he saw that joy saw he redeemed he
[1:12:11] saw you gathered Rather's throne singing
[1:12:13] Hosanna
[1:12:14] and then he waited up he says it's worth
[1:12:16] it it's worth it it's worth being spit
[1:12:19] upon it's worth my bed being ripped out
[1:12:22] it's worth being scourged and rejected
[1:12:25] and dying with a broken heart
[1:12:27] hallelujah it is worth it because he
[1:12:31] despised you know he endured the cross
[1:12:34] despising the shame was the joy that was
[1:12:37] set before him was you redeemed you got
[1:12:39] to look at the gold we look at natural
[1:12:43] goals too much
[1:12:44] what about spiritual goals eternal goals
[1:12:47] because there'll come a time when
[1:12:49] there's no time and eternity is sitting
[1:12:52] where will you be where will you be you
[1:12:56] know I'm gonna be on streets of gold and

[1:13:24] our goal who wants to hear that voice
[1:13:26] who was the hereit said to you then you
[1:13:28] should lay aside every weight and every
[1:13:31] sin that so easily besets us I mean and
[1:13:33] run this race with patience hallelujah I
[1:13:36] want nothing to do with this world I
[1:13:38] want nothing to do with it spirit I want
[1:13:41] nothing to do with this culture I want
[1:13:43] nothing to do that's religion I want him
[1:13:45] I want to be separated to him all my
[1:13:48] heart soul mind and strength honor me
[1:13:50] for him it's worth it I wonder I want
[1:13:53] the greatest relationship with him that
[1:13:54] any man could ever have hallelujah I
[1:13:57] trust that should be our your ambition -
[1:13:59] I want to walk with Him like few have

[1:14:37] into the into the car and it was like
[1:14:39] here and brother Briscoe said my next
[1:14:42] breath I felt like it could take me to
[1:14:44] eternity he looked over at the Prophet
[1:14:47] he said look like he's a man is just
[1:14:48] about to die and he sees now this is
[1:14:52] brother brems would so I don't believe
[1:14:53] he's over exaggerating he sees now
[1:14:55] thousands times ten thousand times he's
[1:14:57] come to me and it's always the same no
[1:15:01] it's like I could just die it's a
[1:15:03] fearful thing but I would this is just
[1:15:07] me if God could come and visit me in
[1:15:10] that manner you know many times we sit
[1:15:13] in as blessings and it's incredible but
[1:15:16] that's even greater
[1:15:18] that's everything great of him to come
[1:15:20] down in that way now it's a fearful
[1:15:21] thing but to know there you'll be
[1:15:25] standing there you may feel like because
[1:15:27] we're not really built in these bodies
[1:15:29] as be in such an atmosphere but to be in

[1:15:34] no condemnation upon you I mean but is
[1:15:36] but but you're totally sealed away into
[1:15:39] his kingdom

[1:16:03] in the presence off I mean that that is
[1:16:05] not just us walking along but he walks
[1:16:07] with us amen that he he takes us by the
[1:16:10] hand and he leads us don't isn't that
[1:16:13] what we want
[1:16:14] I mean but the only way we can really
[1:16:15] have that is now whole heart I mean I
[1:16:18] don't want to be an adulteress I mean I
[1:16:21] don't want to be guilty of adultery of
[1:16:22] living with the world living with the
[1:16:25] devil and trying to live with God at the
[1:16:27] same time I don't want to have two
[1:16:29] husbands I mean I've got one and he's in

[1:18:07] just that voice what do you walk with me
[1:18:10] and you've actually got to understand
[1:18:12] he's asked you that he asks you that
[1:18:15] service after service every time you
[1:18:18] read the Bible every time you hit the
[1:18:20] message he's a saint will you walk with

[1:18:35] told me hear a voice will you walk with
[1:18:37] me yes then the angel comes down the
[1:18:40] stone rolls away then you step out

[1:18:46] different atmosphere you see the world
[1:18:48] totally different hallelujah but you

[1:18:54] hallelujah
[1:18:57] we'd be made of life we don't walk
[1:19:01] according to the Prince of the power of
[1:19:05] the ear
[1:19:06] I trust you do not anymore what does
[1:19:09] this message seem to do take a bride
[1:19:13] take a people who are not my people and
[1:19:16] they become my people and I will be
[1:19:19] their God and I'll take them and I'll
[1:19:22] lift them up out of slavery above the
[1:19:24] works of the enemy and I'll wash them
[1:19:27] and I'll cleanse them and I'll and I'll
[1:19:30] transform them that the devil has no
[1:19:32] claim upon these ones anymore hallelujah
[1:19:35] when when the hundred and twenty were in
[1:19:37] the upper room I mean the devil still
[1:19:39] had claims on them before the Holy Ghost
[1:19:42] came he said like claims I mean he could
[1:19:46] say the woman at the well was living in
[1:19:49] adultery Peter tried to kill a guy yeah
[1:19:52] there was I know all different ones Mira
[1:19:54] Magdalene had Seven Devils cast out of
[1:19:56] her they were all born in a perverted
[1:19:59] way they were born in a fallen state
[1:20:01] that's his claim remember many times we
[1:20:04] think oh I've never been bad you know
[1:20:06] I'm a good person I've been raised in
[1:20:08] church but you'll born the wrong way
[1:20:10] that's why he must be born again so it's
[1:20:13] not how good you know someone someone
[1:20:16] who sits on a pews never had a real
[1:20:18] experience with God and someone who's a
[1:20:20] serial killer or some some Islamic
[1:20:22] extremists that goes and blows himself
[1:20:24] up and you know kills a whole bunch of
[1:20:26] people
[1:20:27] they're on the same category because
[1:20:31] they're both lost but humanly we have to
[1:20:34] say well this one's worse than this what
[1:20:35] no we're all in the same category we're
[1:20:37] all born lost but this one standing
[1:20:41] and who can you who can change you from
[1:20:44] being lost to being found hallelujah
[1:20:47] and then and then so the devil has
[1:20:49] claims on them I I be called their first
[1:20:55] yo even though I made Adam fall and now
[1:20:58] they're all bought a fallin way the
[1:21:00] devil their claims on them then the Holy
[1:21:02] Ghost comes the one who was in flesh
[1:21:05] hallelujah who walked with him we're
[1:21:08] going to have more than God walking with
[1:21:09] us he's got to be in us that's how he
[1:21:11] can really walk with us if he's in us
[1:21:12] the Holy Ghost comes because now what
[1:21:15] did Jesus do he comes into his ministry
[1:21:19] he starts laying claim on people Peter
[1:21:22] James and John follow me woman at the
[1:21:24] well follow me hallelujah Legion come
[1:21:27] follow me Matthew the text think they'll
[1:21:29] follow me he's laying claim Satan these
[1:21:32] are mine these are mine I'm putting my
[1:21:35] hands upon their they're going to follow
[1:21:36] me they're my property they're going to
[1:21:38] walk with me he's laying claims
[1:21:40] hallelujah and when the and when God
[1:21:43] lays claim on a person good luck devil
[1:21:45] you're going to need it because you
[1:21:47] won't be able to succeed I mean there
[1:21:49] may be a battle raging I mean probably
[1:21:51] know who's going to win I mean we know
[1:21:53] who has the victory our Lord Jesus has
[1:21:56] the victory hallelujah so he lays claim
[1:21:59] a men and he gathers his disciples bury
[1:22:02] Martha Lazarus all the different ones
[1:22:04] hallelujah didn't in there in the upper
[1:22:06] room then the Holy Ghost comes down I
[1:22:09] mean and the Holy Ghost the abstract
[1:22:12] comes down I mean
[1:22:14] seals them into the kingdom and God is
[1:22:16] testifying these ones have nothing the
[1:22:19] devil has no hold upon these ones
[1:22:21] anymore they belong to me
[1:22:23] I've I've redeemed them I've forgiven
[1:22:25] them of present past and future soon I
[1:22:27] mean there's nothing that can be held
[1:22:29] against them hallelujah I have laid
[1:22:31] claim and not just not just actually
[1:22:33] that belongs to me he goes and grabs
[1:22:35] them hallelujah embraces them towards
[1:22:38] bosom I mean these are my ones
[1:22:40] hallelujah that's the same thing with
[1:22:42] you I trust I mean if you have the Holy
[1:22:45] Ghost this morning the devil has no hold
[1:22:47] up on you he has no claim on your life I
[1:22:49] mean that's why the bride can leave this
[1:22:52] world
[1:22:52] I mean because there's none of the
[1:22:53] shackles of the devil religious or
[1:22:55] otherwise that can hold their earthbound

[1:23:44] one day walk through the door I don't
[1:23:47] know where I'll be I'm not worried where
[1:23:49] I'll be but one day I expect this one
[1:23:51] and I won't recognize him at first me I
[1:23:53] say the Scriptures really remember when
[1:23:55] we said the scriptures are so rich hello

[1:24:23] where are we verse this three among whom
[1:24:27] also you all had our conversation in
[1:24:29] times past in the lusts of our flesh
[1:24:31] does it feel good yes does not feel good
[1:24:34] I won't do it that's the lust of the
[1:24:35] flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:24:37] might of the flesh and of the mind and
[1:24:38] we're by nature the children of Wrath
[1:24:40] even as others they've got to understand
[1:24:42] if God is in you you have overcoming
[1:24:45] power over your own self you have
[1:24:47] overcoming power over your own self
[1:24:49] hallelujah so because God is in you our
[1:24:52] trustees in you then he is greater than
[1:24:55] the desires of the flesh and of the mind
[1:24:56] and he will make it subject to his own
[1:25:00] word amen you yeah that's like a most
[1:25:03] yogi you take like the world straw
[1:25:06] this man and he comes and he picks me up
[1:25:08] I I can I don't think I could even
[1:25:11] struck he just pinned me now you're
[1:25:13] going here when God comes yes what I'll
[1:25:38] do whatever you want to do because I
[1:25:40] love you hallelujah
[1:25:42] I'm glad but God who's Richard mercy
[1:25:46] amen but God was Richard mercy for his
[1:25:49] great lover and he loved us I mean you
[1:25:52] say God's never done anything for me yes
[1:25:55] he did
[1:25:55] Amen he's already shown his love for you
[1:25:58] I mean I've never seen a miracle I've
[1:26:00] never seen a healing he's never spoken
[1:26:02] to me what yeah he doesn't really love
[1:26:03] me no you need to go read the Bible
[1:26:06] hallelujah why did he send you Elijah
[1:26:08] the Prophet before the Great and
[1:26:10] dreadful day of the Lord behold us in
[1:26:12] you who's you me he sent me Elijah the
[1:26:15] Prophet Amen that I'll be ready to go
[1:26:18] meet the Lord in the air he's done a lot
[1:26:20] for you hallelujah
[1:26:23] remember if Jesus only came and died for
[1:26:26] you and Elijah was seen only for you God
[1:26:29] would do it all the same he's here now
[1:26:36] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:26:38] quickened us together in Christ by grace
[1:26:41] ye are saved in us raised us up together
[1:26:42] and made us sit in heavenly places in
[1:26:44] Christ Jesus this is the believers
[1:26:46] position in Christ this is where you are
[1:26:48] this is where you are
[1:26:50] don't take it casual I mean don't yo
[1:26:53] it's like anything just say if I go move
[1:26:58] to it a bit it'll take me a while to
[1:27:00] acclimatize to the atmosphere but
[1:27:03] eventually my body will eventually it
[1:27:05] will and I'll get used to it because now
[1:27:08] because my body has caught up with where
[1:27:10] I am now it's the same thing with us you
[1:27:13] meet God it's incredible incredible it's
[1:27:16] even greater but he does something like
[1:27:18] he heals units the
[1:27:19] greatest thing in the world and he comes
[1:27:20] down and you can barely believe it the
[1:27:22] Spirit of God is here I'm in the the
[1:27:25] same God in the Bible that I read about
[1:27:26] I see them do the same things and it's
[1:27:28] amazing and it's incredible but then you
[1:27:31] begin to get used to it not in a bad way
[1:27:33] but then you actually begin to realize
[1:27:36] this is how God works this is what he
[1:27:37] does why because you've become
[1:27:39] acclimatized to the new atmosphere you
[1:27:41] live in and then you try and go back
[1:27:44] into the old atmosphere you know is that
[1:27:47] meant I was a bit of a bit of a nerd but
[1:27:48] probably still am I used to play this
[1:27:50] little game where you make armies out of
[1:27:52] little models yeah yeah that thing
[1:27:56] anyway so I was obsessed with this thing
[1:27:59] and sir
[1:28:00] it's anyway this isn't my team anyway I
[1:28:04] meet the Lord and then I actually one
[1:28:08] time I think I was visiting Christine
[1:28:09] and I had to go print off my ticket for
[1:28:11] the plane and there's a a what'd he call
[1:28:15] it an internet cafe and it also sold
[1:28:18] this stuff so I went into this place and
[1:28:20] I just I wasn't looking at it well I
[1:28:22] just I just did a lap around the aisles
[1:28:24] where it was just walk through and I
[1:28:27] felt such an evil I used to love that
[1:28:29] atmosphere but I got acclimatize to
[1:28:32] another atmosphere and I didn't want to
[1:28:35] go back to that atmosphere hallelujah
[1:28:38] I'm so glad it's true so it's the same
[1:28:41] thing that's why we go to places that we
[1:28:43] used to love
[1:28:43] that's like me I just saw him
[1:28:45] comfortable in this place I feel like a
[1:28:47] you know I just feel like a fish out of
[1:28:50] water or whatever saying you want to put
[1:28:52] it - it's because you now climatized to
[1:28:54] a different atmosphere and he did it
[1:28:58] amen no full by then in the ages to come
[1:29:01] he might show the exceeding riches of
[1:29:04] His grace and his kindness towards us
[1:29:06] through Christ Jesus for by grace you're
[1:29:09] saved through faith and not of
[1:29:10] yourselves it is a gift of God now I've
[1:29:13] said this many times but this is the
[1:29:16] definition of new grace in the New
[1:29:18] Testament now I'm not going to try and
[1:29:19] say it in Greek but um this is so this
[1:29:22] is this word grace here and you'll find
[1:29:24] it in the New Testament virtually in
[1:29:26] every place this is the definition
[1:29:28] graciousness is gratifying of manner or
[1:29:32] act
[1:29:32] concrete literal friggin total spiritual
[1:29:35] especially there's a straight from the
[1:29:37] Strong's Concordance
[1:29:38] especially the divine influence upon the
[1:29:41] heart and its reflection in the life
[1:29:44] this is do you know grace do you know
[1:29:47] grace I mean because this is what grace
[1:29:51] really is the divine influence upon that
[1:29:54] especially now I don't add anyway I just
[1:29:57] copy pasted this especially the divine
[1:30:00] influence upon the heart and its
[1:30:02] reflection in the life grace is not God
[1:30:05] saying I'll turn a blind eye to your sin
[1:30:07] that is not grace that is not grace the
[1:30:10] world has turned God into an old dirty
[1:30:12] granddad who just lets us kids do
[1:30:15] whatever what because that's more
[1:30:16] palatable and also because they preach a
[1:30:19] gospel that could not free the people
[1:30:21] from their sins that's why they say well
[1:30:23] how can we how can we still keep people
[1:30:25] will change the gospel to say just come
[1:30:27] as you are stay as you are that's what
[1:30:29] Jesus said go he he set the people free
[1:30:32] says go and sin no more leads to worse
[1:30:34] and come upon you that's what he said go
[1:30:37] and sin no more and the thing is this is
[1:30:39] what Calvary has done that he would send
[1:30:43] a divine influence this is my
[1:30:46] Thanksgiving a divine influence upon my
[1:30:49] heart and it's reflection the life now
[1:30:52] your life should be the interpretation
[1:30:54] of this definition hallelujah I trusted
[1:30:57] us I trust you can say I am a living
[1:31:00] manifestation of grace amen because once
[1:31:04] upon a time it was the devil's influence
[1:31:06] upon my heart and it and his reflection
[1:31:09] in my life but then grace came I mean
[1:31:12] grace came took away that old husband I
[1:31:14] mean the first husband had to die I mean
[1:31:17] they'll be united to another Paul speaks
[1:31:19] about it in Romans hallelujah and now
[1:31:21] the read so I'm now married to mr. grace
[1:31:29] his name's Jesus Christ and that's
[1:31:33] reflected and because I'm mrs. grace
[1:31:36] this is reflected in my life hallelujah
[1:31:41] and its reflection in the life
[1:31:44] hallelujah now he sees here I trust
[1:31:52] that's you you say well I don't think
[1:31:56] it's me you go to him and die we don't
[1:32:00] have to polish it up as I preach they
[1:32:02] just go you must die you got to die with
[1:32:05] your enemy like Samson he died in the
[1:32:06] temple and he killed mourners death and
[1:32:09] in his life so all of them because what
[1:32:11] happens is your tomb because the temple
[1:32:13] is a tomb a temple is a tomb we were
[1:32:16] sitting we're listening to an orchestra
[1:32:17] and one of the basilica's basilica's in
[1:32:21] central wellington very amazing music
[1:32:26] but we're sitting there are there's a
[1:32:28] Catholic one and it's a basilica a
[1:32:31] Basilica has it did bishop in it so I'm
[1:32:33] thinking I'm sitting in some guys grew
[1:32:36] it to his grave
[1:32:37] listening to music this is weird but no
[1:32:41] one thinks of it that way because it's
[1:32:42] just tradition this is what we do we
[1:32:43] bury people who make a big a big church
[1:32:45] is just a tomb and people go into the
[1:32:48] tomb I was thinking maybe I should
[1:32:50] really be listening to heavy metal in
[1:32:51] here be more appropriate or death metal
[1:32:54] or something anyway so I don't know how
[1:32:58] I got onto that one but you know we at
[1:33:01] tomb not of works at least any man
[1:33:07] should boast for we are his workmanship
[1:33:10] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:33:12] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:33:15] should walk in them so I just came back
[1:33:17] to me Sampson was in the temple of Dagon
[1:33:20] in a temple now a temple has idols
[1:33:24] man-made those idols then man put your
[1:33:28] Samson into that temple now we can turn
[1:33:32] our to because the temple has got what
[1:33:34] demon power in it
[1:33:36] it's deaf it's deaf so I can say it's a
[1:33:39] 2 and we can garnish out
[1:33:43] with idols it can be our our pain it can
[1:33:48] be our unforgiveness it can be our
[1:33:50] resentment it can be our bitterness and
[1:33:53] we can carve this most elaborate thing
[1:33:55] out of it do you know what this person
[1:33:57] did to me I don't have a chisel and this
[1:34:00] happened and why did I have this kind of
[1:34:03] birth my family this way why and then
[1:34:06] BOOM
[1:34:07] and Lord I want to be free and people
[1:34:13] worshiping it well and people say you
[1:34:18] know and what well how do you get rid of
[1:34:21] that thing you guys stand there you find
[1:34:25] where the pillars of the house are paddy
[1:34:28] how do you push it down you got to die
[1:34:30] Samson was willing to die with his enemy
[1:34:32] I remember now our past and things that
[1:34:35] happen in our past can be our biggest
[1:34:36] enemy I mean they can be our biggest
[1:34:39] enemy how do I defeat this enemy in my
[1:34:41] life because remember our past has mold
[1:34:44] us a certain way the reason you are the
[1:34:47] way you are today is because of
[1:34:48] something happened to you in the past
[1:34:50] either your parents did something or
[1:34:52] someone you know how they raised you has
[1:34:55] molded you a certain way and your in
[1:34:57] your society wherever you came from
[1:34:58] things in life good and bad they've
[1:35:00] molded you and you say well how do I
[1:35:03] overcome this you got to push it down
[1:35:07] you have to die if you know if Samson
[1:35:10] wasn't willing to die he would never
[1:35:11] push down the temple a man and he killed
[1:35:15] more in his death and in his life who
[1:35:17] wants to kill some Devils he wants to
[1:35:20] kill some Devils well how do I kill the
[1:35:23] devil in my life push down that you got
[1:35:25] to die you got to die with your enemy I
[1:35:28] trust that's not too crude you got to be
[1:35:31] willing to die now I'm sorry about I
[1:35:34] just like the scripture that's why we I
[1:35:35] don't know the timers but where I'm I
[1:35:38] think it's helped us living she's eight
[1:35:41] thirty on my tablet anyway well anytime
[1:35:44] we're here early
[1:35:45] hallelujah I think I'm still in Papua
[1:35:47] New Guinea out of that anyway so we're
[1:35:49] off I'm sorry about this so there in
[1:35:53] times past you were without Christ being
[1:35:57] aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel
[1:35:58] and strangers from the covenants of
[1:36:00] promise having no hope and without God
[1:36:02] in the world but now in Christ Jesus you
[1:36:05] who are sometimes were far off are made
[1:36:07] nigh by the blood of Christ for he is
[1:36:09] our peace he is our peace amen if you
[1:36:13] need some peace he is our peace
[1:36:15] I mean who hath made both one and hath
[1:36:17] broken down the middle wall of partition
[1:36:19] between us having abolished in his flesh
[1:36:21] the enmity even the law of Commandments
[1:36:24] contained in ordinances for to make in
[1:36:26] himself of twain one new man so making
[1:36:29] peace
[1:36:30] hallelujah I've got peace with my god I
[1:36:32] pray you do too now I want to go into
[1:36:34] this because I said life eternal life is
[1:36:37] different to natural life now this is
[1:36:40] speaking of Jesus made as a priest after
[1:36:42] the order of Melchizedek and I want to
[1:36:44] take this this here who has made not
[1:36:47] after the law of carnal commandment but
[1:36:50] after the power of an endless life after
[1:36:54] the power of an endless life he is our
[1:36:56] high priest now Jesus the life that was
[1:36:58] in him is now in the believer hallelujah
[1:37:01] so now he was he was now he is now
[1:37:04] living by the power of an endless life a
[1:37:07] life that cannot end and a power is a
[1:37:11] force they meant a powers of force I
[1:37:14] mean so he's not living he wasn't living
[1:37:17] just by his own his own human life amen
[1:37:23] if you have met God you don't live by
[1:37:26] the power of your natural life I meant
[1:37:29] because your natural life will come to
[1:37:31] an end if the world turns a few more
[1:37:33] times just in a few decades you know
[1:37:35] most of us won't be here we go 50 years
[1:37:39] he'll still be here I might not be here
[1:37:42] I might well I'll be 82 I might not be
[1:37:46] here for 50 years is not that long I was
[1:37:50] just heading the middle of the
[1:37:51] bell-shaped curve of the age
[1:37:52] distribution of the church you know
[1:37:54] anyway but we 50
[1:37:58] is not long but might even be included I
[1:38:03] might just be a you know in a box six
[1:38:07] feet underground someplace and you and
[1:38:10] you maybe say oh you remember brother
[1:38:13] Ben yes and whatever and you know it
[1:38:15] just be a memory 50 years is not long
[1:38:17] that's if I live after the power of just
[1:38:20] human life human life is under the
[1:38:23] subject of Satan I mean it has no
[1:38:26] dominion it as it is the it is a slave
[1:38:29] but our Lord Jesus has made he wasn't
[1:38:33] made after the kernel this is that this
[1:38:35] is the priesthood but after the power of
[1:38:37] an endless life hallelujah now we the
[1:38:42] believer we have this power we are made
[1:38:45] just just just pull a little bit more
[1:38:48] I'm nearly done I know it's hot in here
[1:38:50] but we're but we are made after the
[1:38:52] power of an endless life now a power as
[1:38:55] I see it as a it's it's it's a power by
[1:38:58] implication and miracle itself ability
[1:39:01] abundance it's many different things
[1:39:02] it's a force a meter now
[1:39:05] now when Jesus came upon the earth I'd
[1:39:08] say the power or the force of God and
[1:39:10] him was manifested in flesh and every
[1:39:13] enemy had to battle that force I mean
[1:39:15] because it's like in physics is the
[1:39:17] greater than sign hallelujah and the
[1:39:19] less then can ever overcome the greater
[1:39:21] then hallelujah and the power of God is
[1:39:24] always greater than the devil I mean it
[1:39:27] yo every demon could line up and try and
[1:39:31] stop the rapture and they would fail
[1:39:33] everyone I mean every demon Amy could
[1:39:36] line up and try and stop you coming
[1:39:38] forth and they would fail everyone
[1:39:40] hallelujah program said about the boy in
[1:39:43] Finland he said now you know because he
[1:39:45] had the vision two years before and he
[1:39:47] finds himself in that scene and he said
[1:39:50] now every difficult line up and try and
[1:39:52] stop that boy coming back to life and
[1:39:53] God would raise him from the dead
[1:39:55] hallelujah that's the kind of confidence
[1:39:57] we've got a heaven our God amen that
[1:39:59] every demon could line up amen and stop
[1:40:02] you every day and that fall every day
[1:40:04] hallelujah because we have a power of
[1:40:06] our endless life you mean me
[1:40:10] little old me yes little old you
[1:40:12] as I said about xem guy he wasn't strong
[1:40:15] he wasn't a military man he didn't have
[1:40:17] a bunch of worries to fight with him he
[1:40:19] just had Knox goes he saw the need of
[1:40:21] his family he went after those
[1:40:23] Philistines and they died everyone holy
[1:40:26] cuz he was standing in his position in
[1:40:28] his Lane and it's the same thing with us
[1:40:30] he probably wasn't feeling he probably
[1:40:32] woke up like any other kind of day I'm
[1:40:34] hungry I've just harvested this and he's
[1:40:38] living in fear he's living in fear
[1:40:40] because he knows the Philistines will
[1:40:41] come in and get his grain again he's
[1:40:43] living in fear he didn't wake up and say
[1:40:45] glory hallelujah we're some Philistines
[1:40:48] I'm gonna go kill them with Marx god I'm
[1:40:50] a son of Abraham hallelujah to God he
[1:40:53] wasn't that kind of person
[1:40:55] he was just living life living in fear
[1:40:58] Allu you then the enemy came on his land
[1:41:00] I mean and that enemy had to die and the
[1:41:05] enemy died and Shem and Shem guy was
[1:41:08] staying there without a scratch
[1:41:09] hallelujah whole bunch of yeah a whole
[1:41:12] bunch of Philistines did around him I
[1:41:14] mean there was a power there wasn't just
[1:41:17] a natural human ability hallelujah
[1:41:20] brother Brahim says he recognized here's
[1:41:22] the son of Abraham and that was enough I
[1:41:24] mean that was enough eca that's what the
[1:41:26] Prophet told us it's the same thing with
[1:41:28] us you've got to recognize I've come
[1:41:30] under a covenant with God
[1:41:32] amen and that covenant is I'll make them
[1:41:34] into my image they'll be like me the
[1:41:37] devil would not be able to hold anything
[1:41:38] against them they'll be washed in my
[1:41:40] blood they'll be as righteous as I'm
[1:41:42] righteous they'll be sinless as I'm
[1:41:44] sinless hallelujah they'll be made in my
[1:41:46] image I will do this I mean you're
[1:41:49] recognized I've come under that covenant
[1:41:50] holy as it doesn't matter and that's
[1:41:52] enough I mean that's enough is it not
[1:41:55] that's enough
[1:41:56] hallelujah so so that is enough then
[1:41:59] every devil must go
[1:42:00] I mean all dad must go don't look at you
[1:42:03] look at him look at his word look at his
[1:42:05] promise hello Lee and Noah looked 120
[1:42:08] years of the promises going to rain I
[1:42:10] mean build this boat like I told you and
[1:42:12] he got his family focused in this is the
[1:42:15] promise God spoke to me hey sure dad God
[1:42:18] people say God speaks to all these
[1:42:20] different people yes he spoke to me I
[1:42:21] mean I found grace in his sight Oh glory
[1:42:25] Gracie sitting inside a many keep this
[1:42:27] family focused we're gonna build this
[1:42:29] boat we're gonna build the sock
[1:42:31] I mean we're gonna layer it and side out
[1:42:32] with pitch it's gonna be this certain
[1:42:34] let's labor do you think they had a
[1:42:36] rejoicing time for 120 years they
[1:42:38] weren't rejoicing sometimes they woke up
[1:42:41] oh okay this big mighty tree cut it down
[1:42:46] it's work but they had an end goal in
[1:42:50] mind they kept the vision in front of
[1:42:52] them they kept the ingo the end goal was
[1:42:55] we're gonna get into this thing God will
[1:42:57] bring the animals and then there's gonna
[1:43:00] be water come dad has never rained
[1:43:02] before how's this gonna happen God said
[1:43:04] I've never seen rain daddy sure the
[1:43:07] scientists I read the New Scientist
[1:43:09] magazine and it said no it's never
[1:43:10] rained and we can now rest assured the
[1:43:13] way of a theory it cannot rain that's
[1:43:16] what they said about cosmology they said
[1:43:18] we now have a theory there's a few years
[1:43:20] ago I read and you signed this magazine
[1:43:21] we can now rest easy I wish I took a
[1:43:23] photo of it we can now rest easy because
[1:43:25] we have a theory for cosmology that
[1:43:28] takes away any need for a creator yeah
[1:43:33] because science is not looking for the
[1:43:35] Creator because they would have hundred
[1:43:37] years ago they should have come to the
[1:43:38] conclusion God made this I'm not the top
[1:43:42] of the food chain what's happening Lord
[1:43:45] hey sure it's gonna rain yeah God said
[1:43:48] is this worth it dead yes it's gonna
[1:43:51] rain kept them focused on the vision I
[1:43:54] mean they'll come a time when a sweep is
[1:43:57] gonna come I tell you friends the power
[1:43:59] to take us from this earth of Nyx is
[1:44:00] already here I mean the powers being
[1:44:03] released through this entire message I
[1:44:04] mean to take us from this world to the
[1:44:06] next world I mean if you have the Holy
[1:44:08] Ghost you have the creative power in you
[1:44:10] I mean to transform this body you're
[1:44:13] carrying it with you back as I saw legs
[1:44:18] that I've got a headache you know and
[1:44:20] things are not going so well you're
[1:44:21] carrying that with you and workers yo
[1:44:24] you having a hard day at work and
[1:44:25] whatever more you carry that with you

[1:44:30] say what is what has happened to me what
[1:44:33] has happened to me you really gotta look
[1:44:34] back I think what well I was once a
[1:44:37] slave to sin

[1:44:44] washed I'll be made a new creation oh
[1:44:47] and the Holy Ghost came into me and I
[1:44:50] see his life living out of me and my
[1:44:52] nature has been changed the person I
[1:44:54] once was

[1:45:05] well who did that and I had so much
[1:45:08] resentment on me I couldn't forgive
[1:45:10] anyone and now I just get on my knees I
[1:45:12] pray for them more than I pray for my
[1:45:13] own soul who did that
[1:45:16] amen the Lord did that so you got about
[1:45:19] your to recognize now the power to take
[1:45:23] me to heaven is in here and I carry it
[1:45:27] with me every day
[1:45:30] even when I have a bad back and I feel
[1:45:32] bad and I feel down and I'm not happy

[1:46:18] endless life it's permanent this is how
[1:46:22] this is how he's made a priest after the
[1:46:24] order of melchizedek by the power of an
[1:46:26] endless life hallelujah and this is now
[1:46:31] this is how we friends

[1:47:23] sheaf he's talking about for the first
[1:47:24] time it came forth for the bride age for
[1:47:27] a resurrection out of dark
[1:47:28] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:47:30] the full maturity of the word waved back
[1:47:32] again in its full power and being waved
[1:47:35] over the people by the same signs and
[1:47:37] wonders that he did back there even as
[1:47:40] the ministry brother branham the same
[1:47:43] things that happened back there happened
[1:47:45] in this day and the same life that was
[1:47:47] back there that's why we can go into the
[1:47:49] book of Acts we can see the Ministry of
[1:47:51] the Holy Ghost through the Apostles and
[1:47:52] we can see the book of Acts is living in
[1:47:54] today hallelujah and that same God that
[1:47:57] was back there with Timothy and all the
[1:47:59] different brethren back there and Dorcas
[1:48:01] and whoever more you know you know the
