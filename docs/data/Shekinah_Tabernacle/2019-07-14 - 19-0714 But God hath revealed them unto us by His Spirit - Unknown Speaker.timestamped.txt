[49:48] that we might know the things that are
[49:51] freely given to us to God which things
[49:53] also we speak not in the words which
[49:56] man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy
[49:59] Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things
[50:01] with spiritual but the natural man
[50:03] receiveth not the things of the Spirit
[50:05] of God for they are foolishness unto Him
[50:07] neither can he know them because they
[50:09] are spiritually discerned but he that is
[50:12] spiritual judges all things yet he
[50:14] himself is judged of no man for who has
[50:17] known the mind of the Lord that he that
[50:20] that he may instruct him but we have the
[50:23] mind of Christ amen a let's go to 1st
[50:26] Peter chapter 1
[50:33] 1st Peter 1 we're gonna read from verse
[50:36] 7 down to verse 16 can you turn me down
[50:41] a bit thank you first Peter 1 and 7 is
[50:49] the trial of your faith being much more
[50:50] precious than of gold that perishes
[50:52] though it be tried with fire might be
[50:55] found unto praise and glory and honor I
[50:57] mean so unto praise and honor and glory
[51:00] at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom
[51:02] having not seen you love in whom though
[51:04] now you see him not yet believing you
[51:07] receive with joy unspeakable and full of
[51:09] glory receiving the end of your faith
[51:11] even the salvation of your souls of
[51:13] which salvation the prophets have
[51:15] inquired and searched diligently who
[51:18] prophesied of the grace that should come
[51:19] unto you searching what or what manner
[51:22] of time the Spirit of Christ which is
[51:24] unlimited signify that when it testified
[51:27] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[51:29] the glory that should follow under whom
[51:32] it was revealed that not unto themselves
[51:33] but unto us they'd administer the things
[51:36] which are now report
[51:38] don't you buy them that have preached
[51:40] the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost
[51:42] sent down from heaven which things the
[51:44] angels desire to look into wherefore
[51:47] gird up the loins of your mind be sober
[51:49] and hope to the end for the grace that
[51:51] is to be brought unto you at the
[51:54] revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient
[51:57] children not fashioning yourselves
[52:00] according to the former lusts and your
[52:02] ignorance but he that which hath called
[52:04] you is holy for be ye holy and all
[52:07] manner of conversation because it was
[52:10] written be holy for I am holy
[52:13] amen may the Lord bless his word this
[52:15] morning you may have your seats amen so
[52:18] I want oh brother Barron would say and
[52:23] um I just get rid of the Bible says that
[52:51] you know I has not seen nor ear has
[52:53] heard or entered into the heart of me
[52:55] and that things which God has prepared
[52:56] for them that love him and many times
[52:58] people stay there and say well it's
[53:00] never it's so wonderful it's never
[53:01] entered into the heart of man has never
[53:03] man has never even thought of how great
[53:05] it will be but that is not the end of
[53:08] the scripture says but the God has
[53:10] revealed them unto us by his spirit so
[53:13] there comes a time where we're what he
[53:16] has in his mind for us on the other side
[53:19] of you know eternity or beyond the
[53:20] curtain of time it actually becomes
[53:22] reality in our in our hearts I mean so
[53:25] it becomes real to us it's not just an
[53:28] imagination or a nice idea but it
[53:30] becomes real because we know that when
[53:33] God reveals his word to us that is him
[53:36] showing what's in his mind I mean so and
[53:39] we know that God's thoughts are eternal
[53:41] they don't change with time so what he
[53:43] declares I mean in his mind or what what
[53:45] he has thought I mean then he transmits
[53:48] it down to the earth I mean that people
[53:49] would know I mean what he is seeing
[53:52] and where we're going so and I'm so
[53:54] wonderful yeah I'm so thankful you know
[53:56] that's why we have this message in this
[53:58] hour that brother Brown would stand and
[54:00] and and and we'll read a bit through
[54:01] crisis miss your God revealed but he
[54:03] basically says that the secrets are and
[54:05] the back parts of God's mind are now in
[54:07] the heart of the bride I mean so and and
[54:10] I trust that that will mean a lot to you
[54:12] I mean that we have because yo Paul you
[54:15] know the Apostle Paul are saying you
[54:17] know who has known the mind of the Lord
[54:18] but we have the mind of Christ
[54:21] so saying you know cuz man has always
[54:22] been trying to search what does God
[54:24] think what does his you know what does
[54:26] he like yeah you as a person what does
[54:28] he love you know houses you know house
[54:30] he revealed himself and because man's
[54:32] man's mind is different to God's mind
[54:34] amen men's ways Allah your God's ways
[54:37] are higher than man's ways I mean but he
[54:40] says now we have the mind of Christ and
[54:41] we understand that you know we've come
[54:43] to a season where we're at the top of
[54:46] the mountain you know as as the Apostle
[54:47] Paul would say you have not come to
[54:49] Mount Zion you haven't come to the law I
[54:51] mean where where no one could even touch
[54:53] the mouth and even if a beast would come
[54:55] you know you know pass some boundaries I
[54:57] had to be killed with a dart you have
[54:58] not come to that place but you've come
[55:00] to mount yo-yo you ever come to Mount
[55:02] Sinai with the law you've come to Mount
[55:04] Zion you've come to the habitation amen
[55:07] of of the bride in Christ you've come to
[55:09] the heavenly Jerusalem I mean and we
[55:11] know that that that when the Apostle
[55:13] Paul was speaking those things as when
[55:15] that was when the foundation of the
[55:17] Churchill's laid that faith was the
[55:18] foundation Christ was the chief
[55:20] Cornerstone I mean but we weren't just
[55:22] to me to stay at the foundation but we
[55:24] were meant to climb the mountain him
[55:25] until eventually that the bride grows
[55:27] into the stature of the fullness of
[55:29] Christ I mean so now we are not at the
[55:32] bottom of the mountain we're at the top
[55:33] of the mountain I mean I'm looking at
[55:35] some of the last stones that would be
[55:37] added into the building
[55:38] amen as as the Apostle Europe EDA would
[55:41] say that we are living stones lively
[55:42] stones built into the temple of God so
[55:45] we are not the beginning stones I mean
[55:47] that was 2,000 years ago we are the
[55:49] finishing stone I mean some of us even
[55:51] you know maybe the last stone to come
[55:54] into the building could be sitting here
[55:55] right now hallelujah so now that's the
[55:58] top of the top of the mountain and and
[56:00] we know that that when you get to the
[56:02] top and divine love comes down and
[56:03] manifests itself I mean
[56:05] his glory filleth all and also we are it
[56:08] now I'm going to tell you right now
[56:10] we're not looking for him to come he's
[56:12] here
[56:12] I'm in divine love is present he is
[56:15] divine love right so we're not looking
[56:17] for Christ to come and that way he's
[56:19] already here I mean some now we are
[56:21] called if that is the case then divine
[56:23] love should be manifesting out of our
[56:25] lives and everything we say do and think
[56:27] I mean if he has the preeminence in us
[56:29] that he should be the principal theme of
[56:31] our talking the principal theme of our
[56:34] actions the principal theme of what we
[56:36] do it should be him hallelujah I mean so
[56:40] he see so we have the mind so we have
[56:43] the mind of Christ so the bride has a
[56:45] different mind to the world how we think
[56:47] how we look at things is very different
[56:49] amen
[56:50] I trust and and I trust that the reason
[56:52] that we look at the world differently is
[56:54] not because you've become conditioned by
[56:55] a church or you know because your
[56:57] parents have said this is how you should
[56:58] be but actually his mind comes into you
[57:01] I mean so you're actually independently
[57:03] thinking not no you're not you're not
[57:06] repeating what your parents have said
[57:07] you're not even repeating what I have
[57:09] said or maybe what brother Bram said but
[57:11] it's God's mind himself as in you that
[57:13] you're not just repeating secondhand
[57:15] things but because you become one with
[57:16] him I mean that it's it's his mind and
[57:19] you Peleliu you I mean there's the whole
[57:22] purpose of you know of the gospel of
[57:24] redemption as God will come and dwell in
[57:26] a people and manifest as glory amen to
[57:28] restore us back to Eden once again I
[57:31] mean so we have the might the bride has
[57:33] the mind of Christ hallelujah amen and
[57:37] and and as as you read there in first
[57:41] Peter I'm just laying a bit of a
[57:42] foundation here with these scriptures
[57:44] but as he's in first Peter you know the
[57:47] the prophets of old by the spirit search
[57:51] diligently and inquired ask God when
[57:53] were these things be but they weren't
[57:55] they weren't for them they were for us
[57:58] hallelujah you know I'm so glad you yeah
[58:01] you think about it you think about
[58:03] church history and even through the Old
[58:05] Testament it was just God was laying a
[58:07] foundation all the hard pan hearing road
[58:09] was yo going in and we turn up and just
[58:11] enjoy the benefits of it you know it's
[58:14] like it's like any country that's
[58:16] founded there you know pioneers would go
[58:17] and they would they would cut the trees
[58:19] down
[58:19] build houses and settlements and roads
[58:21] and all the hard Yakka would be done and
[58:23] in the next generations they just turn
[58:25] up and they don't have to labor that way
[58:26] cause it's already built
[58:27] halleluyah has the same thing with us
[58:29] we're just receiving all the promises
[58:31] that means everything that was
[58:33] prophesied I mean we're not prophesying
[58:35] of a future age but we're now we're now
[58:37] receiving the fulfillment of all the
[58:38] prophecy of the scripture hallelujah
[58:42] isn't that right Abraham was sick
[58:44] Abraham was told this land is yours amen
[58:46] and the promised land he soaked but he
[58:48] sojourned there he never possessed it
[58:50] Amen because the promise wasn't to him
[58:52] it was to a seat and then and then there
[58:54] in Egypt that your God sent Moses to
[58:56] deliver them and then they went and
[58:58] dwelt in that land so they received what
[59:00] was given to Abraham and it's the same
[59:02] thing with us you know the New
[59:04] Testaments that it's all prophecy I mean
[59:07] speaking of today I mean we know that
[59:09] your emphasis means to aim it but to
[59:11] Relaxo to the first church age they
[59:13] aimed at the high calling in Christ but
[59:15] because the church had to go down into a
[59:17] dark age I mean they didn't obtain what
[59:20] was you know what was promised Themis
[59:22] like Israel when I first went into the
[59:24] land they didn't possess the whole land
[59:26] but then when David became king then
[59:28] they took the full borders of their land
[59:30] and it's the same thing today I mean we
[59:32] have a king hallelujah he's come to take
[59:34] over his kingdom and and a kingdom was
[59:37] full of people hallelujah that's why we
[59:39] are his kingdom right so when he becomes
[59:42] king of your life in your possess the
[59:43] fullness of the land every promise in
[59:45] Christ will be yours hallelujah I mean
[59:50] so he's searching what or what manner of
[59:52] time the Spirit of Christ which is in
[59:54] them did signify when it testified
[59:55] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[59:58] the glory that should follow and to whom
[1:00:00] it was revealed not unto themselves but
[1:00:03] unto us they'd administer the things
[1:00:05] which are reported now which are which
[1:00:08] are now reported unto you by them that
[1:00:10] have preached the gospel unto you with
[1:00:12] the Holy Ghost sit down from heaven
[1:00:13] which things the angels desire to look
[1:00:16] into
[1:00:16] wherefore and that word wherefore means
[1:00:18] because of this so because of what we've
[1:00:20] just read I'm gonna what I want to do
[1:00:22] today I pray the Lord you know if we
[1:00:24] keep our focus on God when people lose
[1:00:27] their focus of where they're going then
[1:00:29] they begin to look around and fight one
[1:00:31] another but
[1:00:32] people see there's more land to take
[1:00:34] there's more of the word to obtain I
[1:00:35] mean there's more of the promise to have
[1:00:37] window these were to expand our borders
[1:00:39] we're going to cast out the devil we're
[1:00:41] going to take our position I mean if you
[1:00:43] have that in your heart amen
[1:00:44] you'll be focused on the Lord you'll be
[1:00:46] searching his word I mean you'll be
[1:00:47] diligently walking after him you won't
[1:00:50] care what's going on around you it
[1:00:51] doesn't matter what's happening I mean
[1:00:53] what you see at these five senses you're
[1:00:55] not following that you're following him
[1:00:56] I mean but if you keep your eyes off him
[1:00:58] then you receive those things but if
[1:01:00] your eyes are turned upon the world
[1:01:02] you'll be lost and you'll be frustrated
[1:01:03] you won't know what's going on we're not
[1:01:06] called to be frustrated about what's
[1:01:07] going on I mean we have a promise we
[1:01:09] have a promise of a body changed I mean
[1:01:11] so we've got to expand our borders I
[1:01:13] mean we can't just sit where we are
[1:01:15] everywhere to kick the devil down the
[1:01:18] devil always fights what does he fight
[1:01:19] he fights the bride's position in Christ
[1:01:21] he fights your position in Christ I mean
[1:01:24] that's why you've got to tell him to get
[1:01:26] lost I mean you got a good up your mind
[1:01:28] that makes the strength and reverent
[1:01:29] Ransa bought it hallelujah don't just
[1:01:31] let it run loose I mean there's so many
[1:01:34] voices in this day there's so many
[1:01:37] voices you're going to silence the other
[1:01:39] voices give better silence the accusers
[1:01:41] voice give it a silence that doubt your
[1:01:44] to silence the ardent voice of your
[1:01:45] humanity you had take God in His Word
[1:01:47] hallelujah we're covenant people of his
[1:01:50] word I mean you wouldn't believe it
[1:01:51] hallelujah you'll receive the promise
[1:01:53] that's why I'm preaching this today if
[1:01:56] you're wondering it's not just just
[1:01:58] something to excite your mind holy but I
[1:02:01] want you to see a man we're going to
[1:02:02] take the whole land we are not there's
[1:02:05] not another suit there's not another
[1:02:07] seven Church ages coming I mean the
[1:02:10] Ephesians aimed at relax that we
[1:02:11] intervention into a dark age I mean
[1:02:13] there's not another seven angel yo hey
[1:02:16] ages we are called to a mat but become
[1:02:20] and that's the anointing of the sage I
[1:02:23] mean it is not just a mat and say yes
[1:02:25] but become it hallelujah so this is what
[1:02:28] we call call to have right so we don't
[1:02:31] want to just sit back you got to look at
[1:02:35] where you going looking unto Jesus the
[1:02:38] author and finisher of our faith
[1:02:40] looking into his word that's what you
[1:02:42] got to keep doing Amen see wherefore but
[1:02:46] cause of this good up which means secure
[1:02:48] bind up the loins of your mind be sober
[1:02:51] hope to the end amen hope me as an
[1:02:56] expectation oh there we go thank you how
[1:03:00] did you know what I was losing pretty
[1:03:02] late god bless you amen so hope
[1:03:08] expectation to the end for the grace
[1:03:10] that has brought unto you at the
[1:03:12] revelation of Jesus Christ now we
[1:03:16] understand that we're living in the
[1:03:18] revealing of Jesus Christ I mean with
[1:03:20] the book of Revelation is no longer just
[1:03:22] symbols it becomes reality where brother
[1:03:24] bran would say in the first seal he'd
[1:03:26] say you know that you know that's how it
[1:03:28] was in symbol form but what happens when
[1:03:30] it comes in reality form there's no
[1:03:32] longer a symbol as a mystery but it
[1:03:34] becomes a reality I mean we know that
[1:03:36] revealing it means to take the cover off
[1:03:38] I mean it means an appearing a coming a
[1:03:41] manifestation to be revealed so there
[1:03:43] has to come a time and now is where the
[1:03:46] cover the cover the this is covered but
[1:03:52] now it comes for the revealing of what's
[1:03:54] under the cover I mean it's like man was
[1:03:57] probing at the word to say this is the
[1:03:58] word they could see well it's yo and
[1:04:01] they could see by man's mind well it
[1:04:03] kind of is this you know you know who
[1:04:05] seen a statue unveiling you know you can
[1:04:07] see maybe an elbow you see a shape of it
[1:04:09] underneath you think well I think this
[1:04:10] is what it's going to be there was man
[1:04:12] through the ages probing I think it's
[1:04:13] gonna be this maybe it looks like this
[1:04:15] but then there comes a time where the
[1:04:17] veil comes off hallelujah and I'll just
[1:04:22] put it this way when Christ is walking
[1:04:24] among the seven golden candlesticks
[1:04:25] that's actually that's actually Christ
[1:04:28] and bride form he's good about the paps
[1:04:31] it says with the golden girdle actually
[1:04:33] speaks of a woman that's Christ and
[1:04:35] bride form so when the revelation of
[1:04:37] Christ comes actually Christ revealed in
[1:04:39] you hallelujah I mean that's why God is
[1:04:43] God has got to break the amnesia he's
[1:04:46] got to break the seal off our life take
[1:04:48] the cover off who we are I mean but the
[1:04:50] devil wants to try and put the cover
[1:04:51] back on no you're not the bride no
[1:04:53] you're not special no God doesn't love
[1:04:55] you wait he's trying to put the cover
[1:04:56] back on you'll never obtain the promise
[1:04:58] you'll never get victory in this
[1:05:00] you know what's that he's trying to put
[1:05:01] the cover back on you I say just just
[1:05:03] burn the cover up hallelujah this way
[1:05:06] you've got a cast down reason and cast
[1:05:07] down what the devil says about you his
[1:05:09] opinion doesn't matter
[1:05:11] God's God's Word is the only thing that
[1:05:13] matters I mean so we're now living in
[1:05:16] the time of the revealing at the
[1:05:19] revelation of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:05:22] they're brother Branham says us in
[1:05:24] Christ and mister God revealed this is
[1:05:25] by one spirit were baptized into this
[1:05:27] body born of a spirit and we belong to a
[1:05:30] kingdom and our lives are not Americans
[1:05:32] we're not Germans we're not nothing we
[1:05:34] are Christians we are settled and walk
[1:05:36] in the spirit a love slave pardon me for
[1:05:39] the things of the world and our rights
[1:05:40] to the world we've sold out and brought
[1:05:42] this pearl of great price and walk and
[1:05:45] letting the Holy Spirit manifest itself
[1:05:47] that's what has real churches that's
[1:05:50] what you are what I am or we'll let
[1:05:53] ourselves go and serve God and by his
[1:05:56] word and not by some creatures notice
[1:05:58] the anointed man Christ Himself here our
[1:06:00] God has made no one but now look but now
[1:06:03] it is well he has preeminence --is his
[1:06:05] full control god full he manifested in
[1:06:08] Christ Jesus God's great secret of his
[1:06:10] revelation this great light of
[1:06:13] Revelation has always blinded the wisdom
[1:06:15] of this world in the days of Jesus
[1:06:16] Christ here he was when he was here on
[1:06:19] earth they had blinded them they said
[1:06:22] why you even make yourself God you make
[1:06:25] yourself equal equal with God he was not
[1:06:27] only equal with God he was God himself
[1:06:30] see they don't get it and by the way
[1:06:32] some of you might feel I've heard of
[1:06:34] infidels one time told me that Jesus
[1:06:37] never did say he was the son of God he
[1:06:39] sure did he certainly did you just don't
[1:06:42] know your Bible what did he say to the
[1:06:43] woman at the well see what did he tell
[1:06:45] her I know when Messiah cometh and when
[1:06:48] he comes he'll do these things he said I
[1:06:50] am he that speaks to you and to Paul
[1:06:52] also in different ones notice but now
[1:06:54] cry the church has the preeminence God's
[1:06:57] great secret is always blinded the
[1:06:59] wisdom of the world they can't get it
[1:07:00] they don't just don't understand that
[1:07:03] Satan don't understand and none of the
[1:07:04] risk them understands it but just those
[1:07:06] who are predestinated to understand it
[1:07:08] how God and Christ are one they'll make
[1:07:10] him three every time see they certainly
[1:07:12] will notice Nick
[1:07:14] secondarily to manifest Christ in you
[1:07:16] the hope of glory that great manifested
[1:07:18] God in Christ now Christ manifested in
[1:07:20] you he says look what once was God's
[1:07:23] great secret great mysterious secret in
[1:07:25] his mind is now put in the hearts of the
[1:07:28] believer that as the body of Christ what
[1:07:30] was God's once great secret in his mind
[1:07:32] before the foundation of the world has
[1:07:34] now made manifest he says think of it
[1:07:38] friend
[1:07:38] he says I'm not sure I'm sure we don't
[1:07:41] get it well I can't see it the way I
[1:07:44] ought to you don't see but God's great
[1:07:46] mystery what the eternal Godhead as a
[1:07:48] mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus
[1:07:51] Christ being given down to his church
[1:07:53] what was once in God's mind is now in
[1:07:56] the body of Christ Jesus Christ making
[1:07:59] love to the church's bride whispering
[1:08:01] secrets to her so he is saying very
[1:08:03] clearly what was once in his mind that
[1:08:05] was a secret is now and now now in the
[1:08:08] people his word is now in the people
[1:08:10] hallelujah because we have the mind of
[1:08:12] Christ
[1:08:13] hallelujah no brother Brown would would
[1:08:15] would speak this in and he he this is
[1:08:19] from the church age book but he
[1:08:21] originally says it and the spoken word
[1:08:24] as the original seed now I just want you
[1:08:26] to you know if we go slow we go slow if
[1:08:29] we go fast we go fast just just hold on
[1:08:31] okay hold on and say amen amen now from
[1:08:35] a little group of the true seed of the
[1:08:38] word God will present Christ with a
[1:08:40] beloved bride this is where God tells
[1:08:43] the Prophet pick up your pen and write
[1:08:44] she is a virgin to his word she is
[1:08:46] virgin because no she knows no man-made
[1:08:49] creed or Dogma by and through the
[1:08:52] members of the bride will be fulfilled
[1:08:54] all that was promised of God through
[1:08:57] made manifest in the virgin the word of
[1:08:59] promise came to the Virgin Mary but that
[1:09:01] word of promise was he himself - made
[1:09:04] manifest God was made manifest he
[1:09:07] himself acted at that time and fulfilled
[1:09:09] his own word of promise in the Virgin it
[1:09:11] was an angel that had brought her the
[1:09:13] message for the angels message was the
[1:09:15] Word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at
[1:09:18] that time all that was written of him
[1:09:20] because she accepted his word his word
[1:09:23] to her the members of the virgin bride
[1:09:26] will love him they will have
[1:09:27] potentials for here's their head and all
[1:09:30] pals belong to him they are subject to
[1:09:33] him as members of our bodies are subject
[1:09:35] to our heads oh lord help us
[1:09:37] I mean notice the harmony of the father
[1:09:40] and the son Jesus never did anything at
[1:09:42] all his first shown him by the Father
[1:09:43] John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist
[1:09:47] between the groom and his bride he shows
[1:09:49] her his word of life she receives it she
[1:09:52] never doubts it therefore nothing can
[1:09:54] harm are not even death for if the seed
[1:09:56] be planted the water will raise it up
[1:09:59] again here is the secret of us the word
[1:10:01] is in the bride as it wasn't Mary the
[1:10:05] bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:10:07] knows what he does for she knows what he
[1:10:10] wants done with the word she performs
[1:10:12] the commandment of the word in his name
[1:10:14] for she has thus saith the Lord then the
[1:10:17] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[1:10:19] comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:10:20] planted and watered it comes to full
[1:10:22] harvest serving its purpose those in the
[1:10:25] bride do only his will no one can make
[1:10:28] them do otherwise hallelujah they have
[1:10:31] thus saith the Lord or they keep still
[1:10:32] now we have thus saith the Lord this
[1:10:34] messages thus saith the Lord amen so
[1:10:37] they know it that it has to be God in
[1:10:40] them doing the works who knows then
[1:10:42] fulfilling his own word he will not
[1:10:44] complete he did not complete all his
[1:10:47] work while in his earthly ministry so
[1:10:50] now he works in and through the bride
[1:10:52] because God always works through people
[1:10:53] I mean she knows that boy it was not yet
[1:10:57] time for him to do certain things that
[1:10:59] he must do now but he will not he will
[1:11:02] now fulfill through the bride that work
[1:11:04] which he left for the specific time
[1:11:07] hallelujah now and and then now he says
[1:11:10] now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb
[1:11:13] our promised land is coming in sight
[1:11:15] even as they're stirred now Joshua means
[1:11:18] by Jehovah Saviour and he represents the
[1:11:21] endtime leader that will come to the
[1:11:22] church even as Paul came as the original
[1:11:25] leader caleb represents those that stay
[1:11:27] true to Joshua so he is so so God as God
[1:11:31] is having brother Browne write this down
[1:11:33] and he is telling us that the bride and
[1:11:37] Christ are one and as there was harmony
[1:11:40] between the father of
[1:11:41] son so there is harmony between the
[1:11:44] crook between Christ and his bride he
[1:11:47] gives her the Word of Life she receives
[1:11:49] that she never doubt it she knows it's
[1:11:51] her manifesting through her amen and she
[1:11:54] also knows she also knows that now
[1:11:57] there's a continuation of his ministry
[1:11:59] upon the earth that we have to finish
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:02] God is looking at us to finish his plan
[1:12:05] of redemption you say well how can that
[1:12:07] be well he redeemed us
[1:12:10] but then there's got to be a gathering
[1:12:12] of all the names in the book amen
[1:12:14] because the Lord Jesus knows how many
[1:12:17] are going to be the around the wedding
[1:12:18] supper table amen
[1:12:20] but the thing is those names have to be
[1:12:21] redeemed hallelujah so now the finishing
[1:12:24] of you know the winding up of the plan
[1:12:26] of redemption is based on us I mean
[1:12:29] finding those last names hallelujah amen
[1:12:33] but it's interesting how he says now so
[1:12:35] that's interesting how the law causes
[1:12:37] brother Brown to write this in this
[1:12:39] order speaking of the bride being part
[1:12:40] of him and having his mind but then he
[1:12:43] goes into now let's stand like Caleb and
[1:12:45] Joshua so you know have you ever noticed
[1:12:47] how things are arranged even even the
[1:12:50] Gospels how they're arranged certain
[1:12:53] parables are spoken in certain times he
[1:12:55] goes and you know it's not a haphazard
[1:12:56] ministry that Jesus had there was an
[1:12:59] order or an arrangement in which that he
[1:13:01] that he ministered right and it's the
[1:13:04] same thing when they you know you know
[1:13:06] when God is revealing something there's
[1:13:08] is a reason that two things are
[1:13:10] connected because now we say well we
[1:13:12] have the mind of Christ
[1:13:13] I mean we're part of his wood because we
[1:13:15] as Word made flesh today as we say and
[1:13:17] we all said amen amen because that's
[1:13:20] that's what the scripture does say right
[1:13:22] but now he says now let us stand like
[1:13:25] Caleb and Joshua so so Caleb and Joshua
[1:13:27] we know that their ministry was to take
[1:13:30] caylor's I mean Joshua's ministry was to
[1:13:32] take the people into the promised land
[1:13:33] that they would play receive their
[1:13:36] position in the land I mean in Caleb we
[1:13:38] know he was the one who took his
[1:13:40] resurrection mountain I mean he stood
[1:13:42] truth all the difficult times he stood
[1:13:44] true to the word I mean so now now if
[1:13:47] this is the case God is actually laying
[1:13:49] out a pattern in front of us saying now
[1:13:51] let us stand out now I want you to
[1:13:53] notice something though when this was
[1:13:55] spa
[1:13:55] and maybe I'm jumping ahead of myself
[1:13:57] but when this was spoken this is before
[1:13:59] the seals came open so now now brother
[1:14:02] Brahim said the Pentecostal church was
[1:14:04] like in the wilderness but the the
[1:14:06] preacher sermon turning northward he
[1:14:08] says we've been going around this
[1:14:09] mountain long enough let's go into the
[1:14:10] Canaan let's go into the promised land
[1:14:12] and he received the Joshua Commission
[1:14:14] where we said now and what was the
[1:14:17] Joshua Commission Joshua's Commission
[1:14:18] was to place the people in the land and
[1:14:20] now a ministry had come at the end time
[1:14:22] right
[1:14:23] that people would cross over Jordan
[1:14:25] enter Christ not just receive blessings
[1:14:28] in the wilderness but actually enter
[1:14:29] into the promised land and take their
[1:14:31] position and the reason that brother
[1:14:33] brand received a Joshua Commission is
[1:14:35] because the word that was ministered
[1:14:36] would place us in Christ I mean because
[1:14:38] their Word of God moves us into a
[1:14:40] certain position and puts us in in the
[1:14:43] body where we should be hallelujah I
[1:14:46] mean so we understand that the book of
[1:14:49] Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians
[1:14:51] and and so he says in the first seal no
[1:14:57] no sorry he says this an adoption he
[1:15:01] says so
[1:15:01] Ephesus here sits out like Joshua
[1:15:04] positionally you notice Joshua after the
[1:15:06] crossing over the land and taking the
[1:15:09] land any divide of the land Ephraim here
[1:15:10] Meneses here this one here get here
[1:15:13] Benjamin here he divided the land and Oh
[1:15:15] notice he says this just burns our
[1:15:17] hearts each one of those Hebrew mothers
[1:15:19] giving birth to those children she spoke
[1:15:21] the very place in her labor pains with
[1:15:23] that be positioned in the promised land
[1:15:25] now you go read in Genesis here's some
[1:15:27] homework every time that the patriarchs
[1:15:29] were born it was the mothers that
[1:15:31] actually named them so so when they
[1:15:33] added a name like Ephraim or Manasseh or
[1:15:36] Joseph that was actually prophecy going
[1:15:39] forth aiming to actually place them in
[1:15:41] their position in the land
[1:15:42] hallelujah and then when and then when
[1:15:45] Jacob is is is blessing the patriarchs
[1:15:47] amen those blessings that are written
[1:15:50] there is actually that's an expansion of
[1:15:52] that name actually declaring where
[1:15:54] they'd be in the land so for the name
[1:15:56] that they were given showed where they
[1:15:58] would be hallelujah now brother Branham
[1:16:01] comes to us and he says in the first
[1:16:03] seal now I'm going to call you bride
[1:16:05] that you'll understand so now he's
[1:16:07] calling the bride he's not
[1:16:09] saying with church anymore cuz Church
[1:16:11] has its own inheritance right there is
[1:16:13] the there is the spirit-filled and his
[1:16:15] the nominal church right and they both
[1:16:18] have an inheritance in Christ I mean
[1:16:20] once ones over Jordan ones in the
[1:16:22] wilderness hallelujah so now he's saying
[1:16:25] out now I'll call you bribe that you'll
[1:16:26] understand so he's actually he's
[1:16:28] actually speaking for the name I mean in
[1:16:30] that name gives us a certain inheritance
[1:16:32] hallelujah it gives us a certain all yo
[1:16:35] a certain thing that belongs to us now
[1:16:37] Amen hallelujah Amen it's like I call
[1:16:41] you know Christine's my wife she's part
[1:16:43] of me she you know she has certain
[1:16:45] benefits with that
[1:16:46] hallelujah but then my children are just
[1:16:48] my children it's not the same kind of
[1:16:50] relationship if that makes sense
[1:16:52] yeah it's like Church and bride two
[1:16:54] different things I mean so now so
[1:16:58] because in this hour the promised to the
[1:17:01] over cameras we will sit with him and
[1:17:03] his throne as he said as he also
[1:17:06] overcame and sat down and his Father's
[1:17:09] throne hallelujah so we know our throne
[1:17:12] is a kingdom but also if you're on the
[1:17:13] throne you know you're in charge of that
[1:17:15] kingdom hallelujah so so the over
[1:17:17] Cameron this H will be ascended to the
[1:17:19] throne as the bride does hallelujah Amen
[1:17:23] it says in first John five and three for
[1:17:25] this is the love of God that we keep his
[1:17:27] Commandments and His commandments are
[1:17:29] not Grievous for whosoever is born of
[1:17:31] God overcometh the world and this is the
[1:17:33] victory in that word victory means means
[1:17:35] of success that overcometh the world
[1:17:37] even our faith I mean so our faith or
[1:17:40] our revelation of who we are and who
[1:17:43] Christ is the revelation of the word is
[1:17:45] the means of success that we overcome
[1:17:47] the world by hallelu it's not by our own
[1:17:49] human ability it's not by how smart we
[1:17:51] are it's by the revelation we receive I
[1:17:54] mean that is our means of success how do
[1:17:56] we overcome by the faith God gave us
[1:17:58] hallelujah because we know faith is a
[1:18:00] substance of things hoped for evidence
[1:18:02] of things not seen
[1:18:03] hallelujah so so when we receive
[1:18:05] revelation that that we have an eternal
[1:18:07] body waiting in the heavens I mean there
[1:18:08] is a wedding somewhere to go for there's
[1:18:10] a rapture to be had I mean what's that
[1:18:12] that's evidence that it's there for us
[1:18:14] hallelujah
[1:18:15] I'm glad that so so Ephesus here sits
[1:18:19] out like Joshua positionally now brother
[1:18:22] bran would come
[1:18:23] and the message paradox in 65 he says
[1:18:26] now I believe we're right in the shadows
[1:18:27] of the coming of the Son of God and as
[1:18:30] Joshua just before
[1:18:31] Ephesians raised up so did John the
[1:18:34] Baptist raised up before the next
[1:18:35] Ephesian and we're promised another
[1:18:37] Ephesians now this I hope this is made
[1:18:42] plain so that sounds like he's just
[1:18:44] speaking words up but it's actually
[1:18:45] something that's very important I
[1:18:47] believe as predicted here in the
[1:18:49] scripture therefore I think we are
[1:18:50] living in the Ephesians again we are
[1:18:53] promised what that what was left off
[1:18:56] during those seven ages so if we've come
[1:19:00] to in Ephesians now so so saying now
[1:19:03] we've come to a place where the people
[1:19:05] will take their position in Christ
[1:19:07] because that because that's one of the
[1:19:08] fusions is you got read the book of
[1:19:10] Ephesians it speaks about Christ's
[1:19:12] position and in the believers position
[1:19:15] in Christ right you're once dead in
[1:19:17] trespasses and sins walking according to
[1:19:19] the Prince of the power of the air the
[1:19:20] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:19:21] of disobedience but he's quick and you
[1:19:23] made our lives made you sit in heavenly
[1:19:25] places in Christ Jesus so shows Christ's
[1:19:27] position the bride's position what you
[1:19:29] once were what you are now and he gives
[1:19:31] you the tools to fight Harley and says
[1:19:34] now you've got to grow into the fullness
[1:19:35] of the statue of Christ that's in
[1:19:36] Ephesians hallelujah so so I believe I'm
[1:19:39] looking at a people we're not dead
[1:19:40] anymore and sin I mean we're not
[1:19:42] darkened in our minds we're not caught
[1:19:44] up in the things of the world I mean but
[1:19:45] we've been raptured up we're being
[1:19:47] caught up in the Word of God will be
[1:19:48] made alive holy we were once dead amen
[1:19:51] brother Graham says what a resurrection
[1:19:52] that was speaking the first resurrection
[1:19:54] which is what a resurrection this is Amy
[1:19:56] for a people to come out of the tombs of
[1:19:58] the world come out of dark that I'm
[1:19:59] nationalism take yo come out of this
[1:20:01] world we once dead but now we're alive
[1:20:03] hallelujah that's a great resurrection
[1:20:06] time I mean if I want to show people
[1:20:08] evidence of the resurrection I'll show
[1:20:09] them you Polly though once dead and
[1:20:11] sending drugs in the world and whatever
[1:20:13] more but they've been made alive in
[1:20:15] Christ how they're been quick and made a
[1:20:17] life to the word because they're part of
[1:20:18] that word hallelujah so here's all you
[1:20:22] know how do you know Jesus's life can
[1:20:24] meet these people hallelujah
[1:20:26] that's why never never ever let the
[1:20:28] devil diminish your testimony amen
[1:20:31] hallelujah
[1:20:33] so Ephesians parallels Joshua it's a
[1:20:36] book of redeemed
[1:20:37] it's the placing of a people in a
[1:20:39] natural land and Joshua but then in the
[1:20:41] book of Ephesians the placing of a
[1:20:42] people in the body of Christ now brother
[1:20:45] barons figures about these two classes
[1:20:46] of people one group the Pentecostals
[1:20:49] it's like they have all the money in the
[1:20:51] bank so the anointing comes down you
[1:20:54] know they rejoice but they don't know
[1:20:56] how to cash your check to use what's in
[1:20:57] the bank and there's the fundamentalists
[1:20:59] that know who they are in Christ but
[1:21:01] they have no money it's like they can
[1:21:04] write the checks but they don't know how
[1:21:05] to you know they've got no power to use
[1:21:06] what they have he says if you just get
[1:21:08] those two together hallelujah and so
[1:21:11] it's the same thing with us I believe
[1:21:13] we've got money in the bank hallelujah
[1:21:16] amen but let's use it let's let's use
[1:21:20] the money let's cash in what do you want
[1:21:22] to buy today imagine if you know imagine
[1:21:24] if you had unlimited funds
[1:21:26] hallelujah would you what would you buy
[1:21:29] and I imagine right now there's a list
[1:21:31] going on
[1:21:32] glory and you would go buy them wouldn't
[1:21:35] you and you would enjoy it that's the
[1:21:37] same thing with the Lord hallelujah we
[1:21:39] got unlimited funds the bank of heaven
[1:21:41] no never comes back insufficient fun it
[1:21:43] always comes back yes signed sealed done
[1:21:45] hallelujah so we got a cash in cash in
[1:21:50] what we have so now now Moses we there's
[1:21:58] a paradox again we know Moses represents
[1:22:00] the law which brought them out of Egypt
[1:22:02] where in Joshua represents grace that
[1:22:05] brought them into the Promised Land so
[1:22:06] the law can never bring someone into the
[1:22:08] body of Christ
[1:22:09] it takes grace to bring them in but so
[1:22:12] now the law if you go read in the Old
[1:22:13] Testament the law places all the non
[1:22:15] bride and their inheritance because
[1:22:17] everyone has an inheritance you know
[1:22:18] it's not just the bride everyone has one
[1:22:20] right so in the law all the non bright
[1:22:23] as its given their inheritance like if
[1:22:25] you take G tirana me to we here's some
[1:22:28] more homework if you're writing it down
[1:22:31] Moses outlines he's the law he's placing
[1:22:35] he says this is where he saw you know
[1:22:38] you know this were the children of Esau
[1:22:39] dwell this is where Moab trousers where
[1:22:42] the ammonites dwell and and and we know
[1:22:44] Esau as well from Esau but Moab and the
[1:22:47] ammonites are from Lots daughters here's
[1:22:49] here's basically nominal
[1:22:51] believers that have come forth he says
[1:22:52] this is their boundaries this is where
[1:22:54] they live
[1:22:54] he says don't meddle with them don't
[1:22:56] fight them just keep journeying through
[1:22:58] don't stop and fuss of what they're
[1:23:00] doing they have their portion just keep
[1:23:02] walking on hallelujah so just keep
[1:23:04] churning on just just leave them be
[1:23:06] that's their boundaries that's where
[1:23:07] they'll be
[1:23:08] but then also it was the same for the
[1:23:10] two-and-a-half tribes that wanted to
[1:23:12] have their inheritance on the wrong side
[1:23:13] of Jordan they came to Moses they said
[1:23:15] we've got a lot of cattle we want to
[1:23:17] stay here because this land is good for
[1:23:19] cattle and then Moses was was actually
[1:23:22] yo he was he was rough with them because
[1:23:26] he actually saw that the sin of their of
[1:23:28] their fathers that were the ten spies I
[1:23:30] said they can't take the land actually
[1:23:32] that same spirit heard out jump down to
[1:23:33] generation and say no no we you know we
[1:23:36] don't want to go over Jordan we want to
[1:23:38] stay right here and now you think that
[1:23:40] is actually crazy why would someone be a
[1:23:42] believer and they say well we've
[1:23:44] received enough blessings I mean we know
[1:23:46] there's one god we've been baptized
[1:23:48] right we've got the church changes down
[1:23:49] we know how to dress we know conduct or
[1:23:51] induction you're just right we want to
[1:23:53] stay here we've got too much to take
[1:23:55] over that's crazy every every real
[1:23:57] blessing belongs over the river I mean
[1:24:00] so we don't want a cabbage down on the
[1:24:01] wrong side of Jordan we want to go over
[1:24:03] Jordan hallelujah so now you say well
[1:24:06] well I'll just I'll just drop this in
[1:24:08] right now what is crossing Jordan you
[1:24:10] have to meet the son of man yourself you
[1:24:12] have to meet the angel yourself you have
[1:24:15] to meet that mighty angel yourself have
[1:24:17] a visitation you had that and so what
[1:24:19] does that mean you got to meet God
[1:24:20] yourself not just be anointed not just
[1:24:23] your rejoice and not just got you you've
[1:24:25] got to meet him where he changes your
[1:24:27] nature changes who you are I mean that
[1:24:30] the word comes open I mean because the
[1:24:32] land that we actually in happen is the
[1:24:34] son of man is the word hallelujah
[1:24:36] where's not just this little thing and
[1:24:37] well yeah well how do you you know what
[1:24:41] are you saying it's basically when we
[1:24:44] come to a spot where we think we've
[1:24:45] found everything there's no more no

[1:24:52] that scripture listen to that message
[1:24:53] again say Lord open up brother BAM says
[1:24:56] the end of his ministry that the Lord
[1:24:57] would open up secret passageways in the
[1:24:59] scripture that would find him where to
[1:25:01] get it we will find the blessing I mean
[1:25:03] it's like brother I'm said
[1:25:04] every scription here if you don't see
[1:25:06] Christ in every scripture read it again
[1:25:09] has everyone ever taken up that
[1:25:11] challenge
[1:25:15] come on his his hit him here's a whole
[1:25:19] year assignment right there

[1:25:29] as well
[1:25:30] hallelujah it's so much more you know
[1:25:33] brother MCS is untapped resources in God
[1:25:36] untapped it's never been has never been
[1:25:39] prospected has never been looked at
[1:25:42] what's there you know like someone who's
[1:25:43] mining you know first they do a you know
[1:25:45] exploration they see what's there and
[1:25:47] they calculate well I think this is it
[1:25:48] then they work out well is it worth
[1:25:49] doing you know what's the effort you
[1:25:51] know it's so it's never been explored to
[1:25:53] see if it's even there it's all in the
[1:25:55] word doesn't mean we go off out of the
[1:25:57] message it's all in the word right but
[1:26:00] we should tap into it I want to be a
[1:26:02] miner don't you tell who you find some
[1:26:05] nuggets find find some food amen
[1:26:08] why just why just you know it's like a
[1:26:09] big massive mention if this whole room
[1:26:12] wait I mean just going to like what's
[1:26:14] your favorite supermarket it just goes
[1:26:16] into the front and get some bananas and
[1:26:17] walks out no you go into what you want
[1:26:20] you search around you oh I haven't seen
[1:26:22] that before
[1:26:23] who does that you know maybe not me so
[1:26:26] much but others do you know cuz I think
[1:26:28] I need listen listen listed and I just
[1:26:30] look for labels what it looks like and I
[1:26:31] go but you know some of us like what's
[1:26:33] here and what's this and what can I do
[1:26:35] with this what's that you're looking
[1:26:37] you're actually wanting to tap into
[1:26:38] what's in there hallelujah
[1:26:40] that just so that's like the scripture
[1:26:42] don't just don't just read the family
[1:26:45] altar pick up your bananas and walk off
[1:26:48] amen big in pep into it
[1:26:53] hallelujah why not amen
[1:26:56] why not if it's untapped resources it's
[1:27:00] a reason the resources there but we got
[1:27:01] to go find it hallelujah so now so he so
[1:27:07] yes of Moses numbers 32 he gets upset at
[1:27:12] them he says now we're for said they if
[1:27:16] we have found grace in thy sight lead us
[1:27:17] this land to be
[1:27:18] given unto thy servants for a possession
[1:27:20] and bring us not over Jordan and Moses
[1:27:23] said unto the children of GAD into the
[1:27:25] children of Reuben shall your brethren
[1:27:26] go to war and you shall sit here and
[1:27:28] we're for discourage either heart of the
[1:27:30] children of Israel from going over into
[1:27:32] the land which the LORD hath given them
[1:27:33] thus did your father's when I sent them
[1:27:35] from Kadesh Barnea to see the land so
[1:27:37] he's saying the same spirit on them has
[1:27:39] now dropped on this future did I'm a
[1:27:42] generation we don't want to be like that
[1:27:45] we went across hallelujah Amen see but
[1:27:50] but they said we'll go help them fight
[1:27:52] to all prey with them we'll sing with
[1:27:54] them we'll come to church with them amen
[1:27:57] he followed me we'll be right there
[1:27:59] we'll encourage them but no you gotta
[1:28:02] cross Jordan you were to die out saying
[1:28:04] Lord you know they cuz they wanted to
[1:28:06] bring something oh we can't bring this
[1:28:08] over Jordan if all we'll stay here I
[1:28:10] can't bring my pride over soul stay here
[1:28:12] I can't bring my own resuming my
[1:28:14] goodness what what I think I am I'm
[1:28:15] gonna you gonna you got to lay your
[1:28:17] whole life down you had a cat at all but
[1:28:19] dung doesn't matter what it is you had a
[1:28:21] counter all but dung that you can win
[1:28:23] Christ hallelujah
[1:28:25] so now brother Brahim seed yeah he sees
[1:28:32] this so there's some paradox again now
[1:28:35] there have been many men raised up and
[1:28:37] they had been for four hundred and
[1:28:39] hundreds of years they had no prophet oh
[1:28:41] they had priests and great men as we
[1:28:43] read in the history between the time of
[1:28:44] Malachi and Matthew four hundred years
[1:28:46] there had been great men but there's no
[1:28:48] prophet and then when he came on the
[1:28:50] scene to prove that he was there
[1:28:53] Ephesians made manifest
[1:28:54] John announced that Jesus was that he
[1:28:57] was the word manifested himself but how
[1:29:01] was Jesus at Ephesians it's because when
[1:29:03] John because when John introduced the
[1:29:06] Messiah the reason for that is would
[1:29:08] take the people into a true Pentecost I
[1:29:10] mean so there was a forerunner John was
[1:29:13] the forerunner he pointed out the Lamb
[1:29:15] of God and the reason he did that is to
[1:29:17] take the people to the Upper Room that
[1:29:19] receive a true Pentecost but God comes
[1:29:20] and dwells in them amen and this is
[1:29:22] exactly the same thing today God's in a
[1:29:25] prophet as we know and the purpose that
[1:29:26] he sent brother Browns ministry as he
[1:29:29] pointed out the Lamb of God the word of
[1:29:30] God amen
[1:29:32] into a true Pentecost where man and God
[1:29:34] are united amen and that's what this
[1:29:36] message does brother says it releases
[1:29:38] the holy spirit upon the people holier
[1:29:41] because when the true word is preached
[1:29:43] in power it releases the Holy Ghost of
[1:29:45] parlor people and it takes you to a true
[1:29:47] Pentecost it takes us back to a true
[1:29:49] book of Acts hallelujah and and and and
[1:29:52] that's what we've come back to we've
[1:29:54] come back to a true Pentecost
[1:29:55] hallelujah and we've come back to that
[1:29:57] true Pentecost why because there's the
[1:29:59] land to possess hallelujah there's an
[1:30:01] image to grow into hallelujah I mean
[1:30:04] it's very clear that's why God moves
[1:30:06] like he does that's why he changed us
[1:30:08] like he has why because we've been taken
[1:30:10] to a true Pentecost hallelujah glory so
[1:30:13] not just an anointing that doesn't
[1:30:15] change our owl nature changes who we are
[1:30:18] but no he comes into our souls not just
[1:30:20] onto a spread onto our souls and changes
[1:30:22] who we are hallelujah this was telling
[1:30:25] the bring your sharing up in Papua New
[1:30:26] Guinea we've come back to a true
[1:30:27] Pentecost and then what happened the
[1:30:30] translator quits for four minutes
[1:30:31] because they can hear everyone in their
[1:30:32] own language Wieck has gone back to a
[1:30:35] true Pentecost it's the word that does
[1:30:37] it it's not the person hallelujah we've
[1:30:39] gone but we've come back hallelujah
[1:30:42] we're not trying to get back to a true
[1:30:43] Pentecost we've come back and the time
[1:30:45] of Pentecost was a release it was the
[1:30:47] fifty years after the attack mean 50
[1:30:49] days after the atonement was young 50
[1:30:52] days after Passover was the time of
[1:30:54] Pentecost poly-r fifties are Jubilee
[1:30:57] we've come back to Liberty again
[1:30:58] hallelujah it means that John has used
[1:31:02] the Messiah took them to a true
[1:31:03] Pentecost I mean just as brother Barry
[1:31:05] introduces to the Word of God that take
[1:31:07] has taken us to a true Pentecost once
[1:31:09] again hallelujah so now so this
[1:31:13] Ephesians Christ was the Ephesians is
[1:31:15] because the people that met him now
[1:31:16] think God took them into their position
[1:31:18] in Christ hallelujah and this has been
[1:31:21] repeated this has been repeated again
[1:31:23] today hallelujah now he sees improving
[1:31:27] his word he says he says but God in the
[1:31:30] midst of all of it he raised up a
[1:31:31] prophet some son of a priest he went
[1:31:35] into the wilderness at 9 years old
[1:31:37] couldn't read his I mean he couldn't
[1:31:39] read his name even if it was the letter
[1:31:42] the size of a boxcar why did he do it he
[1:31:44] was a prophet if he had been
[1:31:46] in the education of his father he'd
[1:31:47] probably been a Pharisee or said you see
[1:31:49] one of their groups but he had an
[1:31:51] important job that was to announce the
[1:31:52] Messiah because why God kept his word
[1:31:56] and proved it a voice of one crime from
[1:31:58] the seminary no behold I've got a
[1:32:00] doctor's degree that might have been
[1:32:01] good for the old lady's birthday Almanac
[1:32:04] but not in God's Word he said the voice
[1:32:06] of one crying in the wilderness prepare
[1:32:08] the way the Lord make his paths straight
[1:32:10] why is he preparing aware of the word
[1:32:13] then that word could be made manifest
[1:32:15] hallelujah ceases don't you see in the
[1:32:17] shadow stop here for a minute and the
[1:32:18] last days we've got to there's got to be
[1:32:21] a place repaired for the wood to be made
[1:32:23] manifest and we're living by the
[1:32:24] evidence of the new land amen the son of
[1:32:27] man to saying that the new land I mean
[1:32:29] the promised land is the son of man the
[1:32:30] word himself hallelujah he says we're
[1:32:34] living by the evidence of it amen and
[1:32:37] this is what should be you know we
[1:32:39] should be living by I mean the word
[1:32:41] himself
[1:32:42] hallelujah so now so so what he's saying
[1:32:45] now he's saying that now history has
[1:32:47] repeated itself as Messiah has come
[1:32:50] again the son of man see the Ministry of
[1:32:52] brother barren is more than healing in
[1:32:53] discernment it's the son of man Jesus
[1:32:56] Christ Himself being made known to a
[1:32:57] people how this that's why you've got to
[1:32:59] look beyond you know look beyond the
[1:33:01] veil of the man I mean look beyond the
[1:33:04] veil of the man and see Christ is
[1:33:05] manifested right and when you actually
[1:33:07] see this is Jesus here again I mean what
[1:33:10] happens is now you can cross Jordan I
[1:33:12] live because we're going to understand
[1:33:14] that this age we're living in so much
[1:33:16] has happened you know we're not just
[1:33:17] continuing on like it like the church
[1:33:19] has four seven church ages I trust I'm
[1:33:21] not boring you I mean but now there's so
[1:33:24] much going on yet God the mighty angel
[1:33:25] has descended in the cell was an open
[1:33:27] book as his time shall be no more there
[1:33:29] shall be no more delay I'm gonna wind up
[1:33:31] my plans holy so if he's gonna wind up
[1:33:34] as planned he's going to get a people in
[1:33:35] their position in him hallelujah amen he
[1:33:39] sees in Ephesians 4 and 11 he says he
[1:33:41] gave some apostles and prophets some
[1:33:45] evangelists pastors and teachers for the
[1:33:48] perfecting which is the complete
[1:33:49] maturity of the Saints for the work of
[1:33:51] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:33:53] body of Christ till we all come in the
[1:33:55] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[1:33:56] of the Son of God into a perfect man
[1:33:59] and to the measure of the stature of the
[1:34:00] fullness of Christ so now this so the
[1:34:02] Apostle Paul saying this is what a grow
[1:34:04] to a man we've come out of darkness
[1:34:06] we're being quickened will be made alive
[1:34:08] hallelujah we're now sit in heavenly
[1:34:10] places where would it grow into the
[1:34:11] fullness of Christ I mean that were no
[1:34:13] longer children we're no longer tossed
[1:34:15] to and fro I mean now this is now as I
[1:34:18] said in the beginning God the bride
[1:34:21] knows what he wants done with his word I
[1:34:23] mean - what he wants done in this season
[1:34:26] the bride knows it I mean so now this is
[1:34:29] the now the bride's goal should be until
[1:34:32] we all come to the unity of faith of the
[1:34:34] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:34:35] perfect man and to the measure of the
[1:34:37] stature of the fullness of Christ and
[1:34:38] speaking individually this should be our
[1:34:40] goal I mean because this is now this is
[1:34:43] the Brides goal in this hour because
[1:34:46] it's the goal of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:47] that a people will come to the fullness
[1:34:49] the word manifested that His divine
[1:34:52] character is in her not just a part of
[1:34:55] it but fully mature is everything he was
[1:34:57] we become right this should be our goal
[1:35:00] this should be the really the theme of
[1:35:02] our lives I mean that we should want to
[1:35:03] see each and every one of us I mean
[1:35:05] growing to the fullness of Christ
[1:35:07] hallelu that were not lying no longer
[1:35:09] spiritual children but will come mature
[1:35:11] I mean then when people see us they see
[1:35:13] Christ's character on display hallelujah
[1:35:16] this is how it yo if you don't will
[1:35:19] where there's no vision the people
[1:35:20] perish people I don't have a vision
[1:35:23] you've got to have a direction where am
[1:35:25] I going in life now I'm not talking
[1:35:27] about through jobs and careers and
[1:35:29] holidays and no it's more than that
[1:35:31] all those things are fine but what's
[1:35:32] your main goal what are you looking for
[1:35:34] in life what is your purpose of being
[1:35:36] upon this earth there should be lord I
[1:35:39] want my family to meet you Lord I want
[1:35:40] to create an atmosphere in my home where
[1:35:42] you come down I mean even if I'm on my
[1:35:44] job wherever maybe Lord I want you to be
[1:35:46] there I mean that they can you can
[1:35:48] quicken your words of their hearts I
[1:35:49] mean because when people are closed off
[1:35:51] God can't minister them but when they
[1:35:52] open up probably that's why sometimes
[1:35:54] you know tell a joke or whatever more
[1:35:56] change the atmosphere it gets people's
[1:35:57] attention well cos God wants to pierce
[1:35:59] through a mentor speak to them but I
[1:36:02] mean but we want to keep an atmosphere
[1:36:03] that you know there's no hardness of
[1:36:04] heart I mean but God can minister that's
[1:36:07] why yo you know brother I'm said if you
[1:36:09] want to see the supernatural relax
[1:36:13] amen we want to have a glorious church
[1:36:15] services relax don't be all tense and
[1:36:18] all gone god oh no say Lord Here I am
[1:36:21] minister to me change me I need changing
[1:36:24] I need a lot of changing amen mould me
[1:36:26] shape me put me on put me on your will
[1:36:28] hallelujah why because his Goldmember if
[1:36:32] he he's going to show Satan that the
[1:36:35] sick and Eve will not fall
[1:36:37] the first Eve was predestinated to fall
[1:36:39] but the second Eve cannot fall I mean so
[1:36:42] he's going to have a people because you
[1:36:44] know a great artist loves to show off
[1:36:46] their work amen that's why they have
[1:36:49] unveilings that's why they have all this
[1:36:50] big fanfare look at this we are God's
[1:36:55] masterpiece in this day hallelujah and
[1:36:58] he doesn't just want to show us off to
[1:36:59] the Angels he want to show us the enemy
[1:37:01] you couldn't stop this happening Satan
[1:37:03] you could not stop my word manifesting
[1:37:05] you could not stop a people loving me
[1:37:07] and giving their lives to me I mean that
[1:37:09] I can mold and shape them into my image
[1:37:10] you couldn't stop it look at what I've
[1:37:12] done that's why he pointed Joe Baptist
[1:37:14] to to Satan you know however many years
[1:37:17] ago have you considered my servant job
[1:37:19] holy way he's showing off this means
[1:37:21] perfect
[1:37:22] I'm so proud he's my son father he takes
[1:37:25] me at his work yeah you know at my word
[1:37:27] he may not understand all things but
[1:37:28] he's perfect there's none like him
[1:37:29] hallelujah and and a sexy the same thing
[1:37:32] with us hallelujah God has testimony
[1:37:35] meetings with his enemy hallelujah holy
[1:37:38] why could these his confidence in his
[1:37:40] salvation
[1:37:41] I mean he's not worried about what tests
[1:37:43] you may go through he has confidence in
[1:37:45] you he had confidence and joy be as
[1:37:47] confidence in you hallelujah I mean you
[1:37:50] know you know the scripture says that
[1:37:52] we're not tried with more than we can be
[1:37:54] and many times we think ma'am we can't
[1:37:55] be this but God knows we can't Alleluia
[1:37:58] amen so now so this is this should be
[1:38:05] the goal of our life because God members

[1:38:20] thing with us because remember the
[1:38:22] promise is not based on us I mean the
[1:38:25] promise is not based on you and
[1:38:26] your performance and what you think you
[1:38:28] can do no it's unconditional I mean when

[1:38:53] evidence
[1:38:54] Holly I've watched you thoroughly clean
[1:38:56] and what do we say yes Lord I believe it
[1:38:58] I mean it when we when we respond in
[1:39:00] that way god quickens the word to our
[1:39:01] hearts amen and we actually possess what
[1:39:03] has been promised to us I mean that's
[1:39:05] why it's so important when God gives us
[1:39:06] a promise you say yes hallelujah Mary
[1:39:09] just said let it be unto me according to
[1:39:10] thy word
[1:39:11] and when she see how can these things be
[1:39:13] it's impossible never been done before
[1:39:14] in the history of man but then she just
[1:39:16] said yes I believe it hallelujah and
[1:39:20] then what she had the baby
[1:39:21] hallelujah and if that kind of faith was
[1:39:24] in her how much more you I mean how much
[1:39:26] for you or hallelujah I mean when when
[1:39:29] brother and said that Mary was just a
[1:39:31] carrier of the life but the bride is the
[1:39:32] seed again hallelujah saw that faith is
[1:39:35] in you I just say Amen let it be unto me
[1:39:37] according to thy word holiest stop
[1:39:39] saying Amen to the devil Amen people
[1:39:42] people listen to him no he say Satan my
[1:39:45] salvation is not based on you devil why
[1:39:49] do we talk to him I know I probably go
[1:39:51] down this road maybe I'm getting old on
[1:39:52] it over why do we listen to Satan and we
[1:39:54] listen to our feelings our victory is
[1:39:57] not based on our feelings hallelujah I'm
[1:40:00] feeling feel I'm gonna take a rapture
[1:40:02] today No and Enoch walked with God and
[1:40:06] was not I don't know how he was feeling
[1:40:08] it wasn't recorded because it wasn't
[1:40:10] important maybe you know it wasn't a
[1:40:15] porter hat I don't know did he have a
[1:40:17] cold did he have the flu did he have
[1:40:19] trouble at home I don't know he walked

[1:40:41] you no good it's because it doesn't do
[1:40:43] him any good the word doesn't help Satan
[1:40:46] hallelujah cause it's not for him it's
[1:40:48] for you
[1:40:49] amen hallelujah we're gonna look at the
[1:40:53] value of what we have I mean you say
[1:40:56] well God hasn't changed me at all how do
[1:40:58] you know how do you know we look at
[1:41:02] ourselves in the mirror God changes by
[1:41:04] little by little someone comes along and
[1:41:06] says man they've changed and you just
[1:41:08] feel well I'm just the same guy oh no
[1:41:11] hallelujah amen
[1:41:14] just walk with God this trouble walk
[1:41:18] things are going on just walk with God
[1:41:21] oh yeah brother it says if the church
[1:41:24] are the new its position he says it will
[1:41:28] one day then the rapture will go when it
[1:41:30] knows what it is this is why this should
[1:41:33] be our goal
[1:41:34] Lord show us may we know as we are known
[1:41:36] by you
[1:41:37] hallelujah may you reveal to us who we
[1:41:40] are on you hallelujah that's what we
[1:41:42] need to do amen now it says in second
[1:41:47] Corinthians three
[1:41:48] you are our epistles written in our
[1:41:50] hearts read and known of all men for as
[1:41:52] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[1:41:54] the Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[1:41:56] written not with ink Lord the spirit of
[1:41:58] the Living God not in tables of stone
[1:42:00] but in fleshy tables of the heart he's
[1:42:03] saying now that you the words that we
[1:42:05] are preaching is now manifested in your
[1:42:06] life
[1:42:07] holy is the word that was preached by
[1:42:09] them is now manifested in their lives so
[1:42:11] so so when I read this last hour singing
[1:42:12] why are we preaching at our children
[1:42:15] amen
[1:42:16] because we know that there's their
[1:42:18] carnal nature they need to die up they
[1:42:20] need to be born again sure but when
[1:42:21] they're young what are we what are we
[1:42:23] ministering to them by our words our
[1:42:25] deeds you know what are we preaching
[1:42:27] them because it will manifest amen help
[1:42:30] us Lord that was just maybe that was
[1:42:32] just for me amen now Ephesians 4 and 14
[1:42:34] he says that he hints forth be no more
[1:42:36] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:42:39] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:42:41] sleight of men and cunning craftiness
[1:42:43] whereby they lie and wait to the Seif so
[1:42:47] we've got to be we're going to grow
[1:42:49] hallelujah we don't want to be tossed to
[1:42:51] and fro
[1:42:52] amen but speaking the truth and love
[1:42:54] that may grow up into him in all things
[1:42:57] which is the head even Christ for whom
[1:43:00] the whole body fitly joined together and
[1:43:02] compacted by that which every joint
[1:43:03] supplieth according to the effectual
[1:43:06] working and the same every part maketh
[1:43:08] increase of the body and to the edifying
[1:43:10] of itself and love this I say therefore
[1:43:14] so because of what I've just said and
[1:43:17] testifying the Lord that ye henceforth
[1:43:18] walk not as other Gentiles walk and the
[1:43:21] vanity of their mind
[1:43:22] I mean having the understanding darkened
[1:43:25] being alienated from the life of God
[1:43:27] through the ignorance that is in them
[1:43:29] because of the blindness of their hearts
[1:43:30] so we shouldn't walk in the vanity of
[1:43:32] our mind
[1:43:33] what's your vain things thinking we're
[1:43:35] something thinking we're great
[1:43:36] you know people people they you know
[1:43:39] think their material statuses is what
[1:43:41] makes them great you know in the world
[1:43:43] but doesn't make them great oh they got
[1:43:45] a bigger house a bigger whatever that
[1:43:47] doesn't make think about it but but it's
[1:43:48] vanity look I've got this and then in a
[1:43:51] few years it's gonna be ashes anyway
[1:43:53] hallelujah you know so we shouldn't walk
[1:43:56] in the vanity of our mind
[1:43:57] vanity just means empty things has no
[1:43:59] substance the word has substance amen
[1:44:02] because we're not darkened from the
[1:44:04] Aeneid from the life of God anymore amen
[1:44:08] who being past fear who being past
[1:44:12] feeling feeling have given themselves
[1:44:14] over unto lasciviousness to work all
[1:44:17] uncleanness with greediness but ye have
[1:44:20] not so learned Christ if so be that ye
[1:44:22] have heard him and have been taught by
[1:44:24] him and the truth is in Jesus that ye
[1:44:27] put off concerning the former
[1:44:28] conversation the old man which means the
[1:44:31] man our life the old man which is
[1:44:32] corrupt according to the deceitful lusts
[1:44:36] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:44:38] mind
[1:44:39] amen oh hey good rub there and that ye
[1:44:44] put on the new man which after God is
[1:44:46] created in righteousness and true
[1:44:48] holiness wherefore putting away lying
[1:44:50] speaking every man truth with his
[1:44:52] neighbor but we are members one of
[1:44:54] another be ye angry and sin not let not
[1:44:57] the Sun go down upon your wrath neither
[1:44:59] neither give place to the devil I mean
[1:45:02] let him that steal
[1:45:03] I'm stole steal no more but rather let
[1:45:05] him lay
[1:45:06] but other words that may he do the
[1:45:08] opposite of what he did and sin amen
[1:45:10] working with his hands the things which
[1:45:12] is good that he may have to give to him
[1:45:15] that needeth that no corrupt
[1:45:17] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:45:19] but that which is good to the use of
[1:45:22] edifying that it may Minister grace unto
[1:45:25] the hearers some a minister a divine
[1:45:27] influence upon their hearts and it's
[1:45:29] reflection in their life hallelujah
[1:45:31] that's how we should be amen
[1:45:34] that's what we need to be now this is
[1:45:39] we're so the son of man is the land
[1:45:42] right we have to recognize each and
[1:45:45] every one of us that Christ came in 63
[1:45:48] with an open book the mighty angel came
[1:45:50] down to give us our inheritance right
[1:45:52] there's actually an event it wasn't
[1:45:54] sermons you know the seal series wasn't
[1:45:56] just a series of sermons that we can
[1:45:57] learn what happens the book of
[1:45:58] Revelation it was an event taking place
[1:46:00] when the word came over from 63 or 65
[1:46:03] that was Christ himself coming to his
[1:46:05] bride and me to give her his inheritance
[1:46:07] of her inheritance in him hallelujah as
[1:46:10] an event I meant and that mighty angel
[1:46:13] is still upon the earth I mean that will
[1:46:15] be placed in our inheritance as well
[1:46:16] hallelujah you say well what does this
[1:46:19] have to do with in Ephesians we are
[1:46:21] living in that is the reason we are in
[1:46:23] Ephesians because Christ is here amen to
[1:46:26] take us to a true Pentecost that we get
[1:46:29] placed in the body of Christ where we
[1:46:30] should be amen so you say well what
[1:46:37] should I do I'm I say dig into the
[1:46:40] message there's more and there than you
[1:46:42] know more in the scripture than you know
[1:46:44] brother Brahim said when the seals came
[1:46:46] open this was a new book he's reading
[1:46:49] the same book for 30 whatever years but
[1:46:51] then when the wood came open this became
[1:46:53] knew it wasn't a different Bible as the
[1:46:55] same Bible right but because Christ
[1:46:57] himself came to his word to reveal who
[1:47:00] we are in him it became a new book
[1:47:03] hallelujah so we should say Lord let's
[1:47:06] dig in let's take our land I mean
[1:47:09] because you know when a revelation
[1:47:11] strikes the heart that's God's mind
[1:47:14] being transmitted down and that
[1:47:16] revelation releases a power in the
[1:47:18] person's life I'm
[1:47:19] they can overcome the world and overcome
[1:47:21] themselves it's like when you receive
[1:47:23] the revelation that Jesus died for you
[1:47:25] on the cross what happened is it
[1:47:27] released a power in your life to break
[1:47:29] the power of sin from you I mean because
[1:47:31] when you realize you were lost and
[1:47:33] undone you said lord save me and he
[1:47:35] revealed to you that he he took your
[1:47:37] sins did you know that doubt Calvary you
[1:47:40] you realized he was your sin that
[1:47:41] offering and you realize you didn't
[1:47:43] carry your sin no more because he
[1:47:45] carried it for you what happens it
[1:47:47] changes you
[1:47:47] what cuz the revelation releases a power
[1:47:49] in your life hallelujah and it's the
[1:47:52] same thing when God reveals you this
[1:47:53] messages Christ himself
[1:47:55] at me to take a bride in a rapture what
[1:47:57] happens that that releases a power I'm
[1:47:59] sure it released a power in your life
[1:48:01] I'm in it now you're like Lord I want to
[1:48:03] line up with your word Lord I want to
[1:48:05] love you more than anything Lord yes
[1:48:06] yeah yeah your producers of worship holy
[1:48:09] when you realize what God has done over
[1:48:10] a young you know producer worship you're
[1:48:12] so thankful Lord you're so good to us
[1:48:14] hallelujah and so why I'm saying this is
[1:48:17] keep looking in the wood because there's
[1:48:19] more revelation I mean there's more
[1:48:21] power yo you know we come to a place
[1:48:23] where the enemies now against us and
[1:48:24] with yo you know it feels like we just
[1:48:26] pushing again saying he said well how
[1:48:27] can I overcome this thing well your
[1:48:29] faith will give you the victory your
[1:48:31] revelation will give you the victory but
[1:48:33] then you look into the scripture and you
[1:48:34] find
[1:48:35] I mean God opens a story opens a
[1:48:37] character to you and it becomes a
[1:48:39] revelation then you find yourself that
[1:48:40] the things you once battled you don't
[1:48:42] battle no more why because the power of
[1:48:44] his word has been released through that
[1:48:45] revelation hallelujah so that's why I'm
[1:48:48] saying these things there's value in
[1:48:51] spending time in the scripture even if
[1:48:54] it's just you know he said well I don't
[1:48:56] have a lot of time we're just that
[1:48:58] little time use and then start from
[1:48:59] there hallelujah you know because we
[1:49:03] want to be caught up you know if you're
[1:49:05] caught up in something you rearrange
[1:49:08] your life to spend maximum might
[1:49:09] maximize your time and that thing
[1:49:12] Allu yeah and and that's what we want to
[1:49:14] do it's not about well I have to spend
[1:49:16] three hours a day and make it a law no
[1:49:18] hit be on your heart you can be walking
[1:49:20] who's ever just been driving or walking
[1:49:22] down the road or you know you're not in
[1:49:25] church you don't have your Bible open
[1:49:26] you know have the message plugged in and
[1:49:28] the scripture just comes to mind
[1:49:30] hallelujah why what's happening is
[1:49:32] because you haven't
[1:49:33] union with God she'll be having time
[1:49:35] with the Lord and you can be shopping or
[1:49:37] you can be working whatever and God
[1:49:38] starts ministering to your heart the
[1:49:40] things you've read before he he brings
[1:49:42] to your remembrance and quickens to your
[1:49:44] soul I mean what's that that's spending
[1:49:46] time with the Lord hallelujah but the
[1:49:49] pens and our frame of mind of where our
[1:49:52] thoughts are caught up sure we've got to
[1:49:54] think about what you know I trust we
[1:49:56] think about driving when we're driving
[1:49:57] you know you know we have to give some
[1:50:01] you know thought part of what we're
[1:50:04] doing in life sure so it doesn't mean
[1:50:06] you used to become a monk and you never
[1:50:07] think about what you're doing and where
[1:50:08] you're going but you know but it depends
[1:50:11] about your frame of mind
[1:50:13] Allu you know I thought I'm just gonna
[1:50:17] leave it there but look into it there's
[1:50:20] more on this word than then we even know
[1:50:23] there's more to the Lord Jesus than what
[1:50:26] we fare them are but we've heard it all
[1:50:28] no we haven't heard it all oh I
[1:50:30] understand it all you maybe understand
[1:50:32] it but it's not down here you hallelujah
