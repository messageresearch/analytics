[53:18] and we're gonna read from here then also
[53:22] we're gonna read from the next chapter
[53:24] so John 11 verses 17 down Luis is and
[53:30] then when Jesus came he found that he
[53:32] had lain in the grave for four days
[53:34] already this is speaking of Lazarus now
[53:36] Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15
[53:39] furlongs off and many of the Jews came
[53:41] to Mary to Martha and Mary to comfort
[53:44] them concerning their brother then
[53:46] Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus
[53:49] was coming went and met him for Mary was
[53:52] still in the house and says then said
[54:00] Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had us
[54:03] been here my brother had not died but I
[54:06] know and even now so we just dropped
[54:09] down to verse 21 I know but even now
[54:11] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[54:13] give it thee jesus saith unto her thy
[54:15] brother shall rise again Martha saith
[54:18] unto him I know that he shall rise again
[54:21] in the resurrection at the last day
[54:23] jesus said unto her I am the
[54:26] resurrection and life and the life he
[54:29] that believeth in me though he were dead
[54:31] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[54:34] and believeth in me shall never die
[54:36] leave without us she saith unto Him yea
[54:39] Lord I believe that thou art the Christ
[54:41] the Son of God which should come into
[54:43] the world and when she had so Sid she
[54:48] went her way and called marry her sister
[54:51] secretly saying the master has come and
[54:53] calleth for thee as soon as she heard
[54:55] that she arose quickly and came unto Him
[54:58] now we're just going to go to the next
[55:01] chapter John 12 and we're going to read
[55:05] the first few scriptures here from John
[55:08] 12 sysm and then from verse 1 in jesus
[55:11] six days before the Passover came to
[55:13] Bethany where Lazarus which was had been
[55:16] dead whom he raised from the dead there
[55:19] they made him a supper and Martha served
[55:21] but Lazarus was one of them that sit at
[55:23] the table with them then took Mary a
[55:25] pound of ointment of spikenard very
[55:29] costly and anointed the feet of Jesus
[55:31] and why
[55:32] his feet with her here and the house was
[55:35] filled with the odor of the ointment
[55:38] then saith one of his disciples Judas
[55:41] Iscariot Simon's son which should betray
[55:44] him why was not this ointment sold for
[55:47] three hundred pence and given to the
[55:48] poor this he said not that he cared for
[55:51] the poor but because he was a thief and
[55:53] he had the bag and beer that was put
[55:56] there in then said Jesus let her alone
[55:58] against the day of my burial as' for the
[56:03] Lord always so for the poor always you
[56:06] have with you but me you have not always
[56:09] a malicious powerheads again in prayer
[56:12] gracious Father we've read your word I
[56:14] pray Lord you would minister what is
[56:17] needful for us in this season Lord to
[56:20] every heart may you grant it in Jesus
[56:21] Christ's name Amen god bless you all you
[56:24] may have your seats this morning I'd
[56:27] like to I'd like to speak on breaking
[56:32] your alabaster box now but first but the
[56:37] first part of this you know so I trust
[56:42] you have listened or watch them if you
[56:44] have not everyone should go to the the
[56:47] BCF archives and watch brother Aaron
[56:49] McGarry preaching on no turning back I
[56:51] want to begin a series if I can go into
[56:54] it about the son of man and and where we
[56:58] are in history because we're living in a
[57:01] monumental time and it's a time where
[57:03] and I'm just going to go into a part of
[57:05] it on but I want to expand on on these
[57:09] thoughts later but we have a time where
[57:12] a bride is being United to Christ and
[57:15] you have to catch what's going on in
[57:17] this day you know we we talk about the
[57:19] Ministry of brother Branham and you know
[57:21] many people they see healings or they
[57:22] see a prophet or they see maybe Creek
[57:24] Bible teaching but it's more than that
[57:26] there's a Jesus Christ has been made
[57:28] known and the people you've got to
[57:31] really become one with Jesus Christ in
[57:33] mistake it's the son of man look 17:30
[57:36] big reveal that's Jesus being revealed
[57:37] making himself known that had United
[57:40] himself with a bride now we read here
[57:42] where John
[57:45] rather has gone to the gone to the tomb
[57:48] of Lazarus and here we have Mary and
[57:51] Martha and and they are they are sisters
[57:54] of of Lazarus now here comes the son of
[57:57] man now there's a there's a a patter not
[58:02] that I want to lay out here before we
[58:05] get to breaking alabaster box but here
[58:07] we have the living bride we have Mary
[58:09] and Martha Luther they represent the
[58:11] Living bride upon the earth the son of
[58:13] man Jesus Christ comes to them and they
[58:15] gather to him that the that the dead in
[58:18] Christ which is Lazarus comes has a
[58:21] resurrection so here we have the cycle
[58:24] of the rapture where there's a call for
[58:26] the bride to gather to the son of man
[58:27] and then once they have gathered become
[58:29] one with him then that causes the
[58:31] resurrection of the sleeping Saints so
[58:34] Mary we see we see Mary now her so Mary
[58:39] calls Martha and we saw Martha calls
[58:42] Mary to come to Jesus and she sees so
[58:45] Mary we read said to her sister secretly
[58:49] saying the master has come and call for
[58:52] thee so here was here was Martha she
[58:55] knew that the son of man was alive she
[58:57] knew the resurrection was there upon the
[58:59] earth because we know the resurrection
[59:02] is a person right jesus said I am the
[59:04] resurrection and the life
[59:06] so the resurrection is a person you must
[59:08] become one with that person you have to
[59:10] become one with the resurrection right
[59:13] so when she said the Masters come and
[59:15] call us for thee I could say she said
[59:18] the resurrection has come and calls for
[59:20] thee hallelujah so now here was the here
[59:23] was the bride was gathered and this
[59:25] produced it caused Lazarus to come from
[59:28] the grave now we're going to go into
[59:29] this later but you know future of
[59:32] services but this is being played out
[59:34] too now now this has been repeated again
[59:36] in these last days we are living in an
[59:39] hour
[59:39] where Luke 17 the revealing of the Son
[59:42] of Man as more than this thoughts and
[59:45] secrets of the heart spring reveal it's
[59:46] God putting on flesh and a people I mean
[59:49] that's what it is it's when his word
[59:51] becomes material and a people that's
[59:53] when Jesus Christ has been revealed
[59:55] again in order to unite himself with us
[59:58] bro
[59:58] and this is part of his coming to the
[1:00:00] earth this is part of a sick and coming
[1:00:02] your living out the part of the sick and
[1:00:04] coming right we'd God becomes flesh in
[1:00:07] people so the master has come and he
[1:00:10] calls for thee I mean you've got to I
[1:00:12] pray that you know by the end of the
[1:00:14] service you'd look at it the message'
[1:00:16] but differently and you'd see it it is a
[1:00:18] bridegroom call it's a call for you to
[1:00:20] become one with Jesus Christ it's not
[1:00:22] religion it's not Church it's a it's a
[1:00:25] marriage it's a union I mean where
[1:00:27] people become one with the Living Word
[1:00:28] right so the master has come he calleth
[1:00:32] for thee so she knew the resurrection
[1:00:35] was upon the earth
[1:00:36] hallelujah Jesus Christ and I and I
[1:00:39] trust that you know that as well I mean
[1:00:42] there were now in this scene there were
[1:00:44] others in the scene there were the Jews
[1:00:45] who went to comfort Mary and Martha cuz
[1:00:48] their brother was dead there the
[1:00:51] Pharisees were around and after Lazarus
[1:00:53] came alive out of the grave that some of
[1:00:56] the Jews went and told the Pharisees
[1:00:57] what happened and then they plan to kill
[1:00:59] Lazarus that had been raised from the
[1:01:01] dead and so but the thing is so so when
[1:01:05] when Jesus Christ does anything when the
[1:01:08] Son of Man is upon the earth it affects
[1:01:10] a whole different kind of people and
[1:01:11] affects the elect that he's looking for
[1:01:13] it also fixed the ones that actually
[1:01:15] hate him and want to destroy him and and
[1:01:18] everyone in between
[1:01:18] right so thing is they could not grasp
[1:01:22] what had taken place in their day they
[1:01:25] thought Jesus was just a prophet as as
[1:01:29] Jesus asked his disciples in Matthew 16
[1:01:31] who do you say either side who do they
[1:01:33] say that I the Son of Man am and they
[1:01:36] said your Elias or Jeremias or one of
[1:01:38] the prophets but he said who do you say
[1:01:40] that I am so they could see he was a
[1:01:42] prophet but seeing Jesus was a prophet
[1:01:44] it's not enough it's not enough just
[1:01:46] seeing odds of prophet it's a prophetic
[1:01:48] ministry it's something that's nice
[1:01:50] no you got to see the Messiah right they
[1:01:53] had to see they had to see Jesus and his
[1:01:55] first coming as Messiah and then they
[1:01:58] really caught it you know and so that's
[1:02:00] and that's why he asked them but who do
[1:02:02] you say that I am and the same question
[1:02:05] is put into every generations left
[1:02:07] because the Word of God is Messiah and
[1:02:10] he asks you
[1:02:11] you say this's is that a nice way of
[1:02:13] living is it a nice group of people a
[1:02:15] nice social event we go to or is it
[1:02:18] Messiah is the word Messiah or not so
[1:02:22] you have to and it's like even Nicodemus
[1:02:24] when he came to Jesus and John 3 says
[1:02:27] rabbi we know though our teacher come
[1:02:29] from God for no man can do these
[1:02:31] miracles that thou doest except God be
[1:02:33] with him that wasn't enough we know
[1:02:36] you're a teacher come from God it's got
[1:02:37] to be more than that right that he had
[1:02:40] to see he had to see that this was
[1:02:42] Messiah and Jesus came straight out to
[1:02:45] he said unless a man be born again you
[1:02:47] cannot see the kingdom that word that
[1:02:50] word C means to understand to comprehend
[1:02:53] I mean unless the man is born you can't
[1:02:55] even comprehend the kingdom you can't
[1:02:57] understand it it makes no sense people
[1:02:59] can try to explain it to you but it
[1:03:00] won't make sense to you it just
[1:03:01] frustrates people that are not born
[1:03:03] again but those who are truly born again
[1:03:05] they see the plan of redemption they see
[1:03:07] themselves in the plan of redemption
[1:03:08] they see who Jesus Christ is in their
[1:03:10] season
[1:03:11] Amen that's why you must be born again
[1:03:13] it's absolutely essential hallelujah
[1:03:16] so now but to the bride he is revealed
[1:03:18] as Messiah now we so I pray that this
[1:03:24] the message is more than a bunch of
[1:03:27] tapes more than sermons more than
[1:03:30] healing but it's Messiah being revealed
[1:03:32] right that's what I pray that it that it
[1:03:34] is to you now you have to have a
[1:03:39] personal meeting with him you say well
[1:03:43] what has this got to do with breaking an
[1:03:44] alabaster box you've got to know where
[1:03:46] to pour your life out to if you don't
[1:03:49] know where to give yourself you can give
[1:03:52] yourself to the world that's not going
[1:03:53] to give you eternal life you could give
[1:03:55] yourself to a church that's not going to
[1:03:57] help you put your life out for a church
[1:04:00] that won't give you eternal life you
[1:04:01] pour your life out and anoint the word
[1:04:03] that's a different thing
[1:04:04] right if you pour your life out for the
[1:04:07] word I mean then you receive what the
[1:04:09] word has for you Amen so that's what you
[1:04:11] want to do this is why it's very
[1:04:12] important you've got to know we're to
[1:04:14] pour your life out I mean you're going
[1:04:17] to know who to give the right worship to
[1:04:19] now many people think worshipping is
[1:04:22] singing and
[1:04:23] and and skillful music and powerful
[1:04:25] performances by musicians and we think
[1:04:28] that's worship now that may be a part of
[1:04:31] worship but singing isn't worship
[1:04:33] necessarily it can just be performance
[1:04:38] that's not worship nothing against those
[1:04:41] things we love the musicians we
[1:04:43] appreciate each and every one of you and
[1:04:45] the song leaders we love the singing but
[1:04:47] that's not just worship that is actually
[1:04:49] not the heart or core of worship those
[1:04:52] singing and music can be a part of
[1:04:54] worship real worship according to
[1:04:56] Scripture as when you respond to God
[1:04:59] because of the revelation of his word in
[1:05:02] your life then you can really worship
[1:05:05] Him right jesus said you must worship
[1:05:07] Him in spirit the father is seeking him
[1:05:09] to worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:05:12] the truth has to be revealed to you
[1:05:15] right so for example when the Lord Jesus
[1:05:17] saves you then you can worship Him as
[1:05:20] your Savior
[1:05:21] say thank you and Lord you saved me now
[1:05:23] you can worship now you can praise Him
[1:05:25] because he saved you
[1:05:26] same thing when same thing when you know
[1:05:29] he heals you you can say thank you Lord
[1:05:31] you're my healer you can worship Him as
[1:05:33] your healer right when when the cross
[1:05:35] becomes more than a story - but a living
[1:05:37] reality I mean that your sin was placed
[1:05:40] upon him that he took care of your son
[1:05:42] dick I mean he settled the sink wishing
[1:05:44] forever then you can say Lord you are my
[1:05:46] Savior I have salvation through Jesus
[1:05:49] Christ you can worship Him then right
[1:05:51] but unless that is if that is just a
[1:05:54] story tear you can't worship Him in
[1:05:56] reality Holly I'm so glad we can worship
[1:05:58] Him in spirit and in truth I meant if
[1:06:01] you know so so if he's healed he you can
[1:06:05] worship him as your healer as the
[1:06:06] deliverer as a guide as your piece you
[1:06:08] can worship Him as God reveals himself
[1:06:10] then you respond and worship back to God
[1:06:13] you take it through Abraham's journey
[1:06:15] you know all the patriarchs God reveals
[1:06:18] himself to them then they build an altar
[1:06:19] in worship because they're worshiping
[1:06:21] God as after God has revealed himself
[1:06:23] but before that he's just someone else's
[1:06:26] story he's someone else's testimony but
[1:06:29] when he becomes your testimony then you
[1:06:31] can really worship Him hallelujah that's
[1:06:34] why I'm so glad he's not some idea he's
[1:06:37] reality he's here to know he's here to
[1:06:39] be known hit a walk worth he'd have a
[1:06:41] relationship with hallelujah so when God
[1:06:45] opens his word then we can worship Him
[1:06:47] in a greater way now God has opened his
[1:06:50] word to us in this day the lamb has
[1:06:53] taken the book the seals are being
[1:06:55] loosed off the book and the and that
[1:06:58] title deed of redemption is now in the
[1:07:01] hands of the bride again everything Adam
[1:07:03] lost has been placed in your possession
[1:07:05] I mean that means we can worship Him
[1:07:07] according to that I mean we can worship
[1:07:10] Him that now we have everything Adam
[1:07:11] lost is now in our position amen and
[1:07:14] when that becomes a reality to the bride
[1:07:16] you can worship God like John did in
[1:07:20] Revelations 5 he says when the when the
[1:07:23] seals came when the land took the book
[1:07:25] he said everything in heaven and in the
[1:07:28] earth underneath heard me cry glory
[1:07:30] blessings honor be to the lamb
[1:07:32] hallelujah because he began to worship
[1:07:35] Him based on what he was doing in his
[1:07:37] day hallelujah now let's just go to I
[1:07:42] want to what do we have it I want to
[1:07:44] jump to this then we're gonna jump back
[1:07:45] a bit let's read this I put this up on
[1:07:47] the cou made your maybe a bit too small
[1:07:50] he say so this is from the breech
[1:07:53] brother I'm saying is my name here I
[1:07:55] don't know I hope it is but if it is
[1:07:57] that was put on the book before the
[1:07:59] foundation of the world but the first
[1:08:01] thing that represented that redemption
[1:08:02] come the Lamb that had been slain from
[1:08:05] the foundation of the world he took the
[1:08:06] book glory open the book tore off the
[1:08:08] seals sent it down to the earth to a
[1:08:10] seventh angel to reveal it to his people
[1:08:12] there you are oh my what happened the
[1:08:14] screams and shouts the holy is the
[1:08:16] hosannas the glories the manifestations
[1:08:19] in old john who had been standing there
[1:08:21] our brother crying why he said
[1:08:23] everything in heaven everything in earth
[1:08:25] everything in the sea heard me holla
[1:08:27] Amen blessing honor might and power be
[1:08:30] to him that liveth for ever and ever
[1:08:32] talk about a happy time when them seals
[1:08:34] broke John must have looked in and seen
[1:08:36] past the curtain of time and said
[1:08:38] there's John hallelujah oh he was so
[1:08:41] happy he said everything inhibit he
[1:08:43] really must have cried out didn't he
[1:08:45] everything in here but every
[1:08:46] everything beneath yours every creature
[1:08:48] everything else heard me cry amen
[1:08:50] blessings and glory and honor and wisdom
[1:08:53] and might and riches belong to him amen
[1:08:54] why when the revelation came that the
[1:08:57] Lamb the redeemer our kinsmen had come
[1:08:59] back from the throne of military 'el and
[1:09:00] it walked out there to take his position
[1:09:03] I mean so he looked beyond the curtain
[1:09:05] of time he see then John saw John
[1:09:07] hallelujah you know the four and twenty
[1:09:09] elders around the throne John was one of
[1:09:11] them amen so at one moment he was he
[1:09:16] cried because no man no one was found
[1:09:19] worthy he wept as that when when when
[1:09:22] that book was sealed there he wept
[1:09:24] because in you no man was worthy to take
[1:09:26] the book and then one of the elders hid
[1:09:28] weep not John I'm going to show you a
[1:09:30] mystery
[1:09:30] hallelujah the light of the tribe of
[1:09:32] Judah he's prevailed he's been found
[1:09:34] worthy our Lord Jesus been found worthy
[1:09:36] to take the book and he saw the Lamb
[1:09:38] stepped forth
[1:09:39] bloody wounded I mean he he prevailed
[1:09:41] the overcame he took what he bought
[1:09:43] hallelujah that book represents you
[1:09:45] you're part of redemption I mean that
[1:09:47] book represents you say he was rejoicing
[1:09:49] because there he was he leaned on Jesus
[1:09:52] bosom he saw him die he he saw him
[1:09:56] appear in a glorified form he saw that
[1:09:59] part of the redemption but he was
[1:10:01] waiting for the second part hallelujah
[1:10:03] seeking and worship him according to the
[1:10:05] first part now he's waiting for the
[1:10:06] second and then now here comes that same
[1:10:08] Lamb that he knew he takes the book and
[1:10:11] then he opens the seals and he sees his
[1:10:13] name in the book hallelujah and we say
[1:10:16] what does that got to do with me has
[1:10:18] this word gripped you there's a
[1:10:20] bridegroom cold this messages together a
[1:10:23] bride to the son of man right there

[1:10:31] the book of redemption

[1:10:35] aren't added they're there or they're
[1:10:37] not there hallelujah if God has gripped
[1:10:40] you hallelujah I think we should rejoice
[1:10:42] I mean I've seen I've seen my name being

[1:10:56] lost he has purchased for me and giving
[1:10:58] it back to me now I am a title deed
[1:11:00] holder the enemy cannot hold anything
[1:11:02] against me everything's being struck off
[1:11:04] by the blood of Jesus Christ I mean the
[1:11:06] full power of the blood is now enforced
[1:11:08] on this day where people are free and
[1:11:10] neat hallelujah
[1:11:12] that's why week now we can worship Him

[1:11:26] hallelujah and you have to understand
[1:11:29] he's a symbol in the book he's a symbol
[1:11:32] of you that means it has to be manifest
[1:11:34] that revival has to be manifested upon
[1:11:36] the earth I mean when the word came open
[1:11:39] he had a revival and it's the same thing
[1:11:41] with your life the word comes personally
[1:11:43] open to you right this goes from stories
[1:11:46] to a personal love letter and you see
[1:11:49] your Redeemer in there and you see
[1:11:50] yourself and you see what he's done for
[1:11:52] you

[1:11:55] but we don't care too much about him

[1:15:24] you can't help it let's see my brother
[1:15:27] man talks about well you know cheap
[1:15:29] bering wolf they can't help with the
[1:15:30] wool gross what happened to you
[1:15:33] yesterday
[1:15:33] I just think grass I'm just being a
[1:15:36] sheep but the oldest wool what what
[1:15:38] happened did you plan this no I just
[1:15:40] think grass
[1:15:41] I'm a sheep the life in me pushes it out
[1:15:44] paola is the same thing with the luck
[1:15:46] with the word right this message becomes
[1:15:49] flesh in you because the life in you
[1:15:51] pushes it out you can't help but I'm
[1:15:54] glad I can't help what it is you know
[1:15:58] glory to God so now we can we can
[1:16:01] worship God hallelujah because it's no
[1:16:05] longer a symbol in the book it's a
[1:16:08] living reality Holly how are you John
[1:16:11] glory to God amen now he says in the
[1:16:16] rapture message he says these three
[1:16:17] things a shout a voice of trumpet has to
[1:16:19] happen before Jesus appears now a shot
[1:16:21] Jesus does all three of them when he's
[1:16:24] descending a shout what is the shot it's
[1:16:25] the message going forth first the Living
[1:16:28] bread of life bringing forth the living
[1:16:30] living bread just feed on the word it
[1:16:32] will produce God will anoint it if it
[1:16:34] falls into the right ground it will
[1:16:36] produce he also sees in the same message
[1:16:39] when I come forth into the message with
[1:16:41] you praying for the sick it was fine but
[1:16:43] when I come with a message if any
[1:16:45] message goes forth if it's a true
[1:16:47] message if it's the church in you and
[1:16:49] miracles of God and hangs around in that
[1:16:51] organization you know it's not of God
[1:16:53] because that thing's already been
[1:16:54] declared jesus went forth and healed the
[1:16:57] sick in order to catch their eyes the
[1:17:00] people and then his message that's right
[1:17:02] it has to have it has to have something
[1:17:05] that God is going to introduce divine
[1:17:08] healing as miracles like that just to
[1:17:10] catch the eyes of the people
[1:17:11] the main heart of it is the message
[1:17:14] that's what it is what comes from and
[1:17:17] here he's trying to get the favor of the
[1:17:19] people so they'll sit and listen to him
[1:17:21] see and there's some indeed it's
[1:17:24] ordained to life some of the grain wheat
[1:17:26] fell on the ground the birds picked it
[1:17:28] up others fell among thorns and some was
[1:17:30] went on prepared ground pre-prepared
[1:17:33] ground and brought forth now as the
[1:17:35] first thing is the sounding the first
[1:17:36] thing is a trumpet
[1:17:38] voices shout and then a voice and then a
[1:17:40] trumpet I shot a messenger getting the
[1:17:43] people ready the second is the voice of
[1:17:45] the resurrection the same voice that's
[1:17:47] the that loud voice in st. John 11 38 to
[1:17:51] 44 that called Lazarus from the grave
[1:17:53] getting the bride together then the
[1:17:55] resurrection of the Dead Sea is too
[1:17:56] caught up to be caught up with it now
[1:17:58] once the three things take place what is
[1:18:01] next was a trumpet a voice a shout a
[1:18:03] voice of trumpet now the third thing is
[1:18:05] a trumpet which is always at the Feast
[1:18:07] of Trumpets is calling the people to a
[1:18:09] feast and that'll be to the bride supper
[1:18:12] and the lamb supper with the bride in
[1:18:14] the sky see I mean so the first thing
[1:18:16] comes forth is message calling the bride
[1:18:18] together the next thing is a
[1:18:20] resurrection of the sleeping bride the
[1:18:22] ones that died back in the other ages
[1:18:23] they're caught together and the trumpet
[1:18:25] the feast in the heavens in the sky why
[1:18:28] it's the thing that takes place friends
[1:18:30] we're right there ready now the only
[1:18:33] thing the church-going coming out has to
[1:18:35] got the labor for the son to ripen the
[1:18:38] great combine will come by after a while
[1:18:40] the week will be the stalks will be
[1:18:44] burnt but the grain will be gathered to
[1:18:45] the garna see how lujah so now this is
[1:18:50] where we are this is today's news now as
[1:18:53] I see it they weren't just Miriam Arthur
[1:18:56] at the tomb of Lazarus there's all kinds
[1:18:58] of people now we read here in seeking
[1:19:02] Corinthians 4 and I'm just gonna go
[1:19:04] through a few you know I was thinking
[1:19:05] maybe another time you our brother bear
[1:19:07] and preaches to the trial
[1:19:08] I'd like to preach a sermon about you
[1:19:10] know people your actors being called to
[1:19:14] a play and you talk about the believer
[1:19:16] and the make believer and the unbeliever
[1:19:18] and he said well what's my lines what's
[1:19:21] my motivation how do I operate then you
[1:19:23] go through the description Cheryl
[1:19:25] because spirits don't die I mean they
[1:19:27] just they just uh yo did you see every
[1:19:30] generation but anyway it says seeing if
[1:19:33] we're seeing we have this ministry as we
[1:19:36] have received mercy we faint not but
[1:19:38] have renounced the hidden things of
[1:19:40] dishonesty not walking in craftiness
[1:19:42] which is trickery nor handling the Word
[1:19:45] of God deceitfully which means to
[1:19:47] ensnare but by manifestation of the
[1:19:50] truth commending ourselves to
[1:19:52] every man's conscience in the sight of
[1:19:53] God but if our gospel be hid it is hid
[1:19:56] to them that are lost so Paul is saying
[1:19:59] we're not walking just honestly we're
[1:20:01] not coming saying one thing and actually
[1:20:03] bringing another thing but we're but we
[1:20:05] are manifesting there's a manifestation
[1:20:07] of the truth we're not handling the word
[1:20:10] deceit flee but honestly right is not to
[1:20:12] ensnare the word liberate he's been
[1:20:15] liberated from sin there's been
[1:20:17] liberator from their first nature we've
[1:20:19] been liberated from the world there's
[1:20:22] been liberated from religion and
[1:20:23] traditionally maybe that means we've
[1:20:25] been free right so so we're not handling
[1:20:28] the word Amen not walking in trickery
[1:20:31] right not handling the word deceitfully
[1:20:34] to ensnare but Amen but by a
[1:20:36] manifestation of the truth right but if
[1:20:39] our gospel be hid its hid to them that
[1:20:41] are lost in whom he says in whom this
[1:20:47] god of this world has blinded the minds
[1:20:51] of them which believe not least the
[1:20:52] light of the glorious gospel I mean with
[1:20:54] who is the image of God see the word is
[1:20:57] the image of God right should shine unto
[1:20:59] them for we preach not ourselves but G
[1:21:01] Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[1:21:04] servants for Jesus sake for God who
[1:21:06] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:21:07] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:21:09] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:21:11] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:21:14] amen so he's saying if it's hidden well
[1:21:16] it's ended him with a loss but this is
[1:21:18] not the you know the god of this world
[1:21:22] has blinded them but this is not what
[1:21:24] we're here to do we're not here to come
[1:21:27] craftily here to manifest the truth
[1:21:29] right that they would that that the
[1:21:32] light would shine upon you now season
[1:21:36] second Timothy I'm just I'm just talking
[1:21:37] about the the juice or just there the
[1:21:40] Pharisees and want to kill Jesus now
[1:21:42] Lazarus I'm just talking about them
[1:21:44] right now let's know also that in the
[1:21:47] last days perilous times shall come
[1:21:49] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:21:52] selves so they shall be selfish covetous
[1:21:56] boasters proud blasphemers now the word
[1:21:59] blessed blessed famous it's a derivative
[1:22:01] of two words and 1 is to hinder which is
[1:22:05] actually
[1:22:06] by injury by implication by injury and
[1:22:08] it's also another word joined together
[1:22:10] which is by rumor
[1:22:11] so the blaspheme it means actually to
[1:22:13] hinder those to hinder people by rumor
[1:22:16] right so people tell us not the truth
[1:22:18] they just telling fables and stories and
[1:22:21] the purpose of it is not to free you
[1:22:23] that you can walk in truth and have a
[1:22:25] Liberty but to hinder you
[1:22:27] but the hinder your walk I mean
[1:22:29] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[1:22:31] without natural affection trucebreakers
[1:22:34] false accusers incontinent which means
[1:22:37] without self-control fierce despisers of
[1:22:40] those that are good traitors heady
[1:22:41] highminded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:22:47] lovers of God now a pleasure is
[1:22:49] something that you enjoy do you say well
[1:22:52] that's fairly obvious but it can be
[1:22:53] anything so it can be a lifestyle a
[1:22:56] hobby a job even your family things that
[1:22:59] get that you love before God well you
[1:23:01] actually you're a lover of pleasure more
[1:23:02] than lovers of God right things that
[1:23:05] take up more attention affection and
[1:23:07] time than God everything's got to be in
[1:23:08] this right place right he sees having a
[1:23:14] form of godliness and that word godless
[1:23:17] means a piety devotedness so people can
[1:23:21] be developed they can have some party
[1:23:22] they can have some comer so some kind of
[1:23:24] religion having a form of godliness but
[1:23:26] denying the power thereof denying the
[1:23:29] word thereof they can actually transform
[1:23:30] oh that doesn't really happen anymore
[1:23:32] that didn't really happen
[1:23:33] that's denying the power of the word
[1:23:35] right from such turn away for of this
[1:23:39] sort they creep into houses and lead
[1:23:42] captive silly woman laden with sins lead
[1:23:45] away with diverse lusts that word lust
[1:23:47] means longing many different kind of
[1:23:49] longings they creep into houses how do
[1:23:51] people creep into houses lead people
[1:23:52] away captive internet social media
[1:23:56] creepin tell them stories that aren't
[1:23:59] true lead them away captive don't free
[1:24:01] them I'm just talking about the Jews and
[1:24:03] the Pharisees because remember the
[1:24:05] everyone's there in the scene right and
[1:24:08] so now ever learning and and and this is
[1:24:11] really why I want to put this in ever
[1:24:13] learning and never able to come to the
[1:24:16] knowledge of the truth now that word
[1:24:18] knowledge
[1:24:19] means a recognition a folders
[1:24:22] discernment and acknowledgement of the
[1:24:25] truth so they will be ever learning
[1:24:27] knowing about God but they will never
[1:24:30] come to a full recognition or a full
[1:24:32] discernment of what he's doing in this
[1:24:33] day an hour right never coming to
[1:24:35] knowledge of the truth so they will not
[1:24:37] fully recognize what has happened just
[1:24:39] like those Jews who are around there
[1:24:41] with Jesus well he's a he's a prophet he
[1:24:43] served men he's a teacher come from God
[1:24:44] no that's not enough he's Messiah it's a
[1:24:47] full recognition that he is Messiah amen
[1:24:52] he says now now as jettisoned generous
[1:24:54] withstood Moses so do these also resist
[1:24:56] the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[1:24:59] concerning the faith but they shall
[1:25:00] proceed no further for their folly shall
[1:25:02] be manifest unto all men as this also
[1:25:05] was now generous and generous were the
[1:25:08] magicians in Egypt they did Moses did a
[1:25:10] miracle they did a miracle Moses did a
[1:25:13] miracle they do the miracle come to a
[1:25:15] point where they couldn't replicate what
[1:25:16] Moses did but they were but the purpose
[1:25:19] of them being it was to harden Pharaoh's
[1:25:20] heart saying well you think you're so
[1:25:23] especially you think you're God's real
[1:25:24] my God's can do the same thing and it
[1:25:27] was to hinder of people leaving Egypt to
[1:25:29] go to the promised land and it's a very
[1:25:31] purpose people rise up against the truth
[1:25:33] and the and the reason they'll that
[1:25:35] spirit in them anoints them to stop
[1:25:37] people walking free from actually
[1:25:39] leaving Egypt the world and becoming one
[1:25:41] with the son of man Jesus Christ so
[1:25:44] those people are there now you say well
[1:25:48] now I'm going to go another way we're
[1:25:50] just going to do a bit of a slalom race
[1:25:51] but we're going to get to the end about
[1:25:53] an alabaster box ok now we're going to
[1:25:56] read this this is from Genesis 4 and I
[1:25:59] just and so we know the story we're just
[1:26:03] going to skip through it Adam knew his
[1:26:04] wife she conceived Nabire Cain said I've
[1:26:07] gotten a man from the Lord and she also
[1:26:09] a bear again his brother Abel Abel was a
[1:26:11] keeper of the sheep but Cain was a
[1:26:12] tiller of the ground and the process of
[1:26:14] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[1:26:16] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[1:26:18] unto the Lord so now they're going to
[1:26:20] worship and Abel he also brought of the
[1:26:23] firstlings of his flock and the fat
[1:26:25] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[1:26:27] Abel and to his offering but unto Cain
[1:26:29] and to his offering he had not respect
[1:26:31] and Cain was very wroth
[1:26:33] his countenance fell and the Lord said
[1:26:35] unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is
[1:26:38] thy countenance fallen if thou doest
[1:26:42] well shalt thou not be accepted and if
[1:26:44] thou doest not well sin lies at the door
[1:26:46] and unto thee shall be his desire now
[1:26:49] shall rule over him and Cain talked with
[1:26:51] his brother Abel and it came to pass
[1:26:52] when they are in the field that Cain
[1:26:54] rose up against his brother Abel and
[1:26:56] slew him now Genesis we know as is the
[1:27:02] seed chapter so everything you see now
[1:27:05] which is fully grown or at maturity it
[1:27:08] was a seed back then so you see it in
[1:27:10] its infant fulmen and Genesis may see it
[1:27:12] fully grown now I just want to review
[1:27:14] this very quickly because Abel and his
[1:27:17] offering is the same as the alabaster
[1:27:18] box and will M will come into that but
[1:27:22] Cain now Cain and Abel they both worship
[1:27:28] they both are worshiping God they're
[1:27:31] both believers in God but Cain offers
[1:27:34] fruit now I just want to say oh well
[1:27:37] I'll just go through it and I'll get to
[1:27:38] my conclusion so Cain offered fruit
[1:27:40] which is outwardly more pleasant so
[1:27:42] let's just go back there we have two
[1:27:44] altars we have two boys worshiping the
[1:27:46] same God one brings fruit what has a
[1:27:49] very pretty altar you can make fruit
[1:27:51] very pretty you know fruit and leaves
[1:27:52] them that can look very nice and then
[1:27:55] another one brings a lamb now I guess
[1:27:59] most of us are townies yeah who's who's
[1:28:02] actually seen a lamb be killed
[1:28:04] who seen yeah who seen a you know throat
[1:28:08] slit all the guts gutted you know who's
[1:28:11] seen that now what is what is more
[1:28:15] pleasing to the eye some fruit or a lamb
[1:28:18] being kicked to death and the smell of
[1:28:21] death coming and it's blood running out
[1:28:23] what's more pleasing you say well fruit
[1:28:25] would be far more pleasant right because
[1:28:28] there's no death with fruit
[1:28:29] there's no life being released right so
[1:28:33] it looks it looks a lot more pleasant
[1:28:35] and then not only that you know because
[1:28:36] we have knives that are sharp I trust
[1:28:38] you've used a sharp knife but Abel
[1:28:40] didn't have metal he only had stone so
[1:28:43] he was with that brother by c/d Hector
[1:28:45] heck the nick of that lamb with a with a
[1:28:48] sharp stone to try and cut its throat
[1:28:50] now people today would say that's
[1:28:53] offensive
[1:28:54] that's disgusting that is horrible that
[1:28:58] is not fair on the animal right that's
[1:29:00] what they'd say they would be repulsed
[1:29:02] by such worship they would say it's
[1:29:05] wrong but they'd say with cane let's say
[1:29:08] no that's lovely that's wonderful we can
[1:29:10] put that on Instagram and it isn't this
[1:29:11] lovely
[1:29:12] you can't put a landing heck together on
[1:29:13] Instagram some content may offend
[1:29:15] they'll put a thing over it like they do
[1:29:17] on Facebook right because the world
[1:29:19] doesn't want their kind of worship
[1:29:20] but able but you see and it's the same
[1:29:24] thing today this is you know because man
[1:29:26] hasn't changed see we would call the
[1:29:31] lamb being killed as being inhumane
[1:29:33] unreasonable messy gruesome some would
[1:29:36] say repulsive but not to God God was
[1:29:39] pleased with the sacrifice and why is
[1:29:42] that because Abel was now living out the
[1:29:44] revelation the faith that God had put in
[1:29:46] him right so now him offering the lamb
[1:29:49] God put that into his heart you've got
[1:29:51] to give a lamb it's going to be lambs
[1:29:52] blood given I mean for you and so he
[1:29:55] lived out that revelation right said he
[1:29:58] didn't care what others would think he
[1:29:59] says I'm going to give a lamb it may not
[1:30:01] look pretty and may not look wonderful
[1:30:03] but hey this thing's gonna die in my
[1:30:05] place and that's how it is today society
[1:30:08] wants a worship that's more acceptable
[1:30:10] not too different from what culture
[1:30:12] Caesar agrees with they want something
[1:30:14] that is not offensive something that
[1:30:16] does not clash with their ideals or
[1:30:18] opinions that's what society wants today
[1:30:21] but with God it's not that way right you
[1:30:25] can't we can't worship God according to
[1:30:27] what other what humanly we think is
[1:30:30] right
[1:30:31] amen you can't break your alabaster box
[1:30:34] you know
[1:30:35] Judah said this is a waste he didn't see
[1:30:38] the value in it amen it may be many
[1:30:40] people it's the able hacking a lamb you
[1:30:43] know with a with a stone to kill it you
[1:30:45] think that's a waste that's unreasonable
[1:30:48] now our life is a worship to God and it
[1:30:52] shows what kind of sacrifice you have if
[1:30:55] it's the fruits of man's ideas and
[1:30:57] thinking or the revelation of the
[1:30:59] word of god me but like member worship I
[1:31:02] said it's not just singing and saying
[1:31:03] Hosanna and raising our hands and having
[1:31:05] a an emotional time it's a life lift
[1:31:08] it's based on the revelation God puts in
[1:31:11] your heart then you worship Him
[1:31:12] according to their so our life every day
[1:31:15] we are worshiping something people
[1:31:18] people give their lives for sport
[1:31:20] they're worshiping sport I know this is
[1:31:22] very obvious but I'm going to bring it
[1:31:23] down people worship a job people worship
[1:31:26] a lifestyle people worship money they
[1:31:29] worship women whatever it may be and
[1:31:31] their whole life is showing a worship to
[1:31:33] that thing right and it's the same thing
[1:31:36] with the with the believer I mean our
[1:31:38] whole life is a worship to Jesus Christ
[1:31:41] so how we treat our families how we
[1:31:43] treat one another even how you treat
[1:31:46] yourself I mean because the devil likes
[1:31:49] us
[1:31:49] well it tries to make us think we are
[1:31:51] not important we are not worthy we're
[1:31:53] not God isn't interested in us we just a
[1:31:56] number we just a bunch of DNA running
[1:31:57] around that's why he tries to devalue us
[1:32:00] I mean but you've got to say God has
[1:32:03] placed the highest value on you you're
[1:32:05] important so how do you how do you feel
[1:32:07] yourself you say well that would make
[1:32:08] you proud know if you know that he
[1:32:11] his life's blood for you as a ransom
[1:32:13] hallelujah when you know that you're
[1:32:16] highly valued but the response of that
[1:32:18] is Lord I'm so thankful I'm so thankful
[1:32:21] you redeem me I'm so thankful you gave
[1:32:24] your life for me on my heart you know
[1:32:26] you know you're on my behalf that you
[1:32:29] care about me that you love me
[1:32:31] amen so our lives that we live are gonna
[1:32:36] be what we were really worshiping what
[1:32:39] we're really producing are we print are
[1:32:41] we actually giving me you know man's
[1:32:43] ideas you know it's like brother brems
[1:32:45] says real simply the word Lord never
[1:32:47] came to a theologian he never came to a
[1:32:50] Bible School God always operated outside
[1:32:53] of those things and the ones that maybe
[1:32:55] he he he called in those places they
[1:32:57] left the Apostle Paul didn't stay it as
[1:32:59] a Pharisee he left right so but if we
[1:33:04] take those ideas in then now we're
[1:33:06] producing fruit we're actually
[1:33:08] worshiping by fruit of men man's ideas
[1:33:10] not by the revelation of the Word of God
[1:33:14] people today do not want a life of
[1:33:16] holiness separated unto God
[1:33:18] they call it offensive right our lives
[1:33:21] we live actually offend many people they
[1:33:24] don't like it it's repulsive it's it's
[1:33:26] it's unreasonable
[1:33:27] just like Abel killing a lamb it's
[1:33:29] unreasonable why would you do this why
[1:33:30] would you live this way you know but to
[1:33:32] those that have the revelation but to
[1:33:35] those that see it in the scripture and
[1:33:36] those that really love God it is not it
[1:33:39] is not a offensive thing but it's a joy
[1:33:43] it's glorious it's a wonderful thing
[1:33:46] although I can live according to your
[1:33:48] word I mean not that I would earn
[1:33:50] anything but because I love you and I
[1:33:51] want to worship you on a living life
[1:33:53] that is out of response of your
[1:33:55] redemption or it's a glorious thing
[1:33:57] right so we have to you know it's all
[1:34:00] depends what's been revealed to us
[1:34:02] that's why it's going to be more than
[1:34:03] man's argument I don't want to be a
[1:34:05] Salesman because someone else will sell
[1:34:08] you a better product right well you'll
[1:34:10] think is a better product but if it's
[1:34:13] revealed to you then it's different no
[1:34:15] man can talk you out of it
[1:34:16] amen so it's so it's how we want to live
[1:34:21] a life Abel's Abel's sacrifice was
[1:34:25] offensive
[1:34:26] now Christendom today does not find it
[1:34:30] offensive of the idea that Jesus Christ
[1:34:32] is the savior of the world that's not
[1:34:34] offensive to them that he is Messiah
[1:34:36] they're smoke that's not offensive he's
[1:34:38] Redeemer he died on the cross to take
[1:34:40] away your sins that doesn't offend any
[1:34:42] Christian just like if you talk to the
[1:34:44] Jews before Jesus was there about
[1:34:46] Messiah they wouldn't find that
[1:34:47] offensive but it was how he manifested
[1:34:50] himself that was the offensive thing
[1:34:52] right when Jesus came and and he did a
[1:34:56] lot of things on the Sabbath to
[1:34:57] aggravate them amen He healed a man who
[1:35:00] was bedridden on the sabbath see take up
[1:35:02] your bed and walk then the pharisees
[1:35:05] found fault in those things
[1:35:06] he was merely doing those things to
[1:35:08] really show what's in them and they
[1:35:10] offended because they hold on to their
[1:35:11] traditions while they rejoiced messiahs
[1:35:14] here right so now those things but it's
[1:35:18] how he manifests himself
[1:35:20] that's what's offensive so before Cain
[1:35:22] and Abel worshiped there was no offense
[1:35:25] that God needs a requires sacrifice
[1:35:27] right but then when Abel acted on the
[1:35:29] revelation God gave you it became
[1:35:31] offensive to Cain and so as soon as now
[1:35:34] as soon as Abel slit the throat of that
[1:35:37] lamb and it bled to death
[1:35:40] I'll say this Abel could not put the
[1:35:43] lamb back together you may say that's
[1:35:45] very obvious the Lambs did on the altar
[1:35:47] it's its blood as being poured out he
[1:35:49] can't put it back he can't bring that
[1:35:52] land back to life he can't get that
[1:35:53] blood scoop it up and put it back and
[1:35:55] heal up the wound and put the life back
[1:35:57] in the lamp no his whole sacrifice was a
[1:36:00] life given right it wasn't something
[1:36:03] that was held back I'll just I'll just
[1:36:05] Nick it on the on the arm and squeeze
[1:36:07] some drops out why are you saying that
[1:36:10] you can't give part of yourself right if
[1:36:14] you really give it true sacra if you
[1:36:16] really give your life to present your
[1:36:18] body and living sacrifice not just the
[1:36:21] parts that are convenient or whatever
[1:36:23] you're going to give you in time being
[1:36:24] just right lad because that lamb
[1:36:26] remember that was Abel's offering I give
[1:36:29] you a whole life I give you a whole and
[1:36:31] not just part not just Sundays and
[1:36:33] Wednesdays Irwin every day every part of
[1:36:35] my day every part of my life everything
[1:36:38] that I am I pour it out and when he gave
[1:36:40] that lamb he couldn't take it back he
[1:36:43] couldn't say well I changed my mind now
[1:36:44] god I actually liked that lamb was my
[1:36:46] price lamb now he gave it and he
[1:36:48] couldn't take it back
[1:36:49] that is true worship that is a true
[1:36:52] offering when he gives us whole life
[1:36:54] right he couldn't take it back Cain
[1:36:57] could take it back his fruit was the
[1:37:01] Ergo just take it and eat it later I'll
[1:37:02] just put this back in the fridge or the
[1:37:03] Fiji drew my fridge and I'll have it
[1:37:05] later the lamb was dead it couldn't come
[1:37:08] back to life we can't keep you can't
[1:37:10] give part of yourself this way people
[1:37:12] struggle so much they get wounded they
[1:37:14] get convicted but they don't really
[1:37:15] fully act on that conviction they don't
[1:37:17] fully give themselves I mean they just
[1:37:19] try and you know find a find some
[1:37:22] wriggle room where they can wriggle out
[1:37:23] no you got to pour your whole life out
[1:37:25] hallelujah and that is the same so the
[1:37:28] life of the lamb was fully poured out
[1:37:30] and I'll say that is exactly the same as
[1:37:33] the broken alabaster box all right you
[1:37:36] think about this is Alaba you know this
[1:37:40] two times Jesus is anointed with an
[1:37:44] alabaster box one is a prostitute she's
[1:37:48] not invited to thee to the Pharisees
[1:37:51] house where Jesus is invited but
[1:37:53] something in her move so I have to I
[1:37:56] just I just want to run this home I want
[1:37:58] you to really think about this she
[1:38:00] wasn't invited to the feast she wasn't
[1:38:02] called there at all but something in who
[1:38:04] said I must anoint this man Street he's
[1:38:07] more than a prophet there's something
[1:38:09] and I'm liking duty talking gift
[1:38:10] forgiveness of sense and she gave she
[1:38:12] took all of her money that she got
[1:38:14] through a prostitution and she went and
[1:38:17] she went into the apothecary whatever it
[1:38:19] was she didn't care I need your best
[1:38:21] give me that off the top shelf not just
[1:38:23] a little offering to make myself feel
[1:38:25] better we don't want to have religion
[1:38:27] just try and cover up our conscience and
[1:38:29] make things better you're gonna give it
[1:38:30] all you got to surrender at all and you
[1:38:32] won't be happy until you do you won't be
[1:38:35] truly at peace until you do why why
[1:38:38] fight the devil you know what's good yo
[1:38:40] you know sometimes you just gonna get
[1:38:42] sick of fighting because really you just
[1:38:45] warring against God stop fighting God
[1:38:46] what's the point of fighting God I'd
[1:38:49] rather be on his side he wins in the
[1:38:53] back here the last chapter of the book
[1:38:56] he wins right anyone who's on his side
[1:38:59] wins I'd rather be on the winner's side
[1:39:02] you know why would he fight you ought to
[1:39:06] be on the losing side people aren't
[1:39:09] willing to they just want to give a
[1:39:10] little bit but she didn't just get I'll
[1:39:11] just get that little sample there and
[1:39:13] then I'll go and sprinkle it on his feet
[1:39:15] I want the best and then she took that
[1:39:18] she somehow snuck into the face she
[1:39:20] wasn't invited this is worship this is
[1:39:22] really giving yourself Emma she so she
[1:39:25] takes it she goes straight to his feet
[1:39:27] hallelujah she didn't ask him for
[1:39:29] permission she just broke it broke the
[1:39:32] alabaster box the oil hallelujah we
[1:39:34] don't love her feet the daughter would
[1:39:37] filled the house hallelujah she couldn't
[1:39:41] put me she couldn't put the ointment
[1:39:42] back
[1:39:44] the box was broken the offering was
[1:39:46] given her life was poured out everything
[1:39:50] she had needed was was taught through
[1:39:51] that offering and she took a took her
[1:39:54] here and she washed his feet with his
[1:39:56] tears hallelujah
[1:39:58] she couldn't put it back and these
[1:40:00] others they say young you're the
[1:40:02] Pharisee that actually invited him see
[1:40:04] if this man really was a prophet he
[1:40:06] would Jesus sinner doesn't he know all
[1:40:09] things oh yeah and she that whole thing
[1:40:14] was arranged that she would come and
[1:40:16] find salvation
[1:40:18] hallelujah doesn't matter what the
[1:40:20] world's doing this world is actually
[1:40:22] engineered that you would find God God
[1:40:25] can find you in this place
[1:40:26] holy that's why many of us have moved
[1:40:28] across the world or our parents have
[1:40:30] moved across the world for the season
[1:40:32] that you had meet the son of man
[1:40:34] hallelujah that whole feast was arranged
[1:40:37] for her and she gave it she couldn't
[1:40:40] take a back seat so I changed my mind
[1:40:42] mr. G's of Nazareth I feel a bit silly
[1:40:44] no she poured it out she didn't care
[1:40:46] what others were doing and that's the
[1:40:47] thing they're precious of the devil
[1:40:50] hallelujah some pressure just all
[1:40:52] conformed don't say anything
[1:40:53] we're not a bunch of tombstones we're a
[1:40:55] bunch of living stones living people of
[1:40:58] living praise hallelujah amen and so and
[1:41:03] what a chi gong her sins were forgiven
[1:41:06] her Simon was still in his condition
[1:41:09] didn't do him any good but she poured it
[1:41:12] out she poured out that alabaster box we
[1:41:15] have to have a life that's given
[1:41:17] hallelujah don't just hold it back well
[1:41:20] this and this and this you know I've
[1:41:22] come to the conclusion Jesus has never
[1:41:24] done anything bad to me people made you
[1:41:28] a lot of bad things Jesus is that
[1:41:30] nothing bad this message is our nothing
[1:41:32] bad to me it's only done good I was lost
[1:41:34] and I'm done lost in the world floating
[1:41:37] down the destruction way then he called
[1:41:39] me and gave me life
[1:41:41] he's only done good to me he Brook
[1:41:45] complexes gave me peace of mind peace of
[1:41:48] heart
[1:41:48] polio sin was washed away there's
[1:41:51] nothing bad with that it's all good you
[1:41:53] mean there's no strings attached to this
[1:41:55] deal
[1:41:56] it must be gone oh right because what
[1:42:01] man there's always strings attached but
[1:42:03] never done anything bad to me so why
[1:42:06] should we you know we should be so
[1:42:08] grouped well what about all these people
[1:42:11] or what about those people in those than
[1:42:13] there whatever more no he should
[1:42:15] what's impacted you the most in your
[1:42:18] life it should be his word should be his
[1:42:21] word his Redemption so corrupt you but
[1:42:23] Paul the Apostle Paul he was here on the
[1:42:27] road to Damascus they'd never left them
[1:42:29] in spite of everything that came in
[1:42:31] false brethren Kaman shipwrecked stoned
[1:42:34] whatever whatever whatever he said none
[1:42:38] of these things move me I'm walking with
[1:42:40] God
[1:42:40] I'm not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:42:42] vision holy he didn't just go to the
[1:42:45] road to Damascus meet God go up an ivory
[1:42:47] tower I've seen some letters out and sit
[1:42:48] there no he had a rugged way he said to
[1:42:51] Timothy it's getting cold or Titus it's
[1:42:54] getting cold bring my coat he's in
[1:42:56] prison
[1:42:57] he didn't have a flowery bed of easy see
[1:42:58] if this doesn't move me I'm not worried
[1:43:00] about these things
[1:43:01] you're reflected and beaten whatever it
[1:43:04] does it hasn't separated me from the
[1:43:05] love of God in Christ holy he is
[1:43:08] persuaded cuz he experienced it
[1:43:10] hallelujah that's why we should just you
[1:43:12] know I was thinking about it this week
[1:43:15] so so Judas goes to betray Jesus you
[1:43:19] don't see Jesus off that saying now I
[1:43:21] wonder what Jesus is saying I wonder
[1:43:22] what he's doing and what's going on
[1:43:23] no he just continued the road he is cool
[1:43:26] to walk down right shouldn't we do the
[1:43:29] same you can take this whole world give
[1:43:33] me Jesus I'm not worried all but
[1:43:37] Russia's here and this is happening in
[1:43:39] the world in this country whatever
[1:43:40] they'll do what they call to do they
[1:43:44] have their calling what about your
[1:43:46] calling
[1:43:46] what about what your call to fulfill the
[1:43:48] word your call to fulfill you should be
[1:43:51] focused on that pal lujah and then we
[1:43:54] come to our opening
[1:43:55] next where he was anointed it was
[1:44:02] anointed let's go back to the beginning
[1:44:04] with another Ella Bester box in John 12
[1:44:09] and this was done for his burial she
[1:44:15] anointed him she couldn't take this back
[1:44:18] costly pointment pound of it she
[1:44:23] couldn't take this back she anointed the
[1:44:26] word coz the wood things were changing
[1:44:29] now into a different dispensation so she
[1:44:32] is now anointing the wood because things
[1:44:34] had changed
[1:44:35] we no longer it wasn't a big healing
[1:44:37] campaign anymore it was now coming he
[1:44:40] was being anointed for his burial amen
[1:44:45] we're here not for a burial the word is
[1:44:50] not here for a burial right it's been
[1:44:52] crucified sure but it doesn't stay
[1:44:55] crucified the word doesn't stay
[1:44:57] crucified doesn't stay in a grave
[1:44:59] doesn't say just the world can explain
[1:45:02] away whatever amen no it's here for a
[1:45:05] resurrection hallelujah he wouldn't stay
[1:45:08] in the grave he couldn't stay in the
[1:45:09] grave it couldn't hold them the Roman
[1:45:12] guards couldn't stop him scribes and
[1:45:14] Pharisees and the naysayers couldn't
[1:45:16] stop him he just moved on through
[1:45:18] hallelujah for this cause I've come into
[1:45:21] the world and he says he says you know
[1:45:24] destroy this temple and I'll raise it up
[1:45:27] again in three days never destroy means
[1:45:29] loose loose this temple loose me from
[1:45:32] this temple I want to dwell with my
[1:45:34] children I want to redeem them I
[1:45:35] wouldn't walk in my disciples loosed me
[1:45:38] from it you're gonna do me a service
[1:45:40] hallelujah and it's the same thing
[1:45:42] friends the mockers and the scoffers and
[1:45:44] the whatever is they do your service
[1:45:47] whether you like it or not they're doing
[1:45:50] yeah you know I just I just marvel who
[1:45:53] calls the resurrection who cause the
[1:45:55] greatest week brother Brown calls of
[1:45:57] history who caused it was it the
[1:46:00] Pharisees they wanted to but they didn't
[1:46:02] it wasn't Jesus he comes Judas he you
[1:46:08] know
[1:46:09] you think his um here Satan and he's
[1:46:11] having a debrief whatever after the
[1:46:13] resurrection he's angry at his demons
[1:46:15] who course this who allowed this to
[1:46:18] happen and then their course they all
[1:46:20] pass the buck and the buck ends at Judas
[1:46:22] Judas Judas is fault because he seemed
[1:46:26] out this is we can take him and betray
[1:46:28] him and you're the betrayer cause the
[1:46:32] resurrection right he calls the
[1:46:35] crucifixion he did it he did Jesus a
[1:46:39] service he did the disciples of service
[1:46:41] he did your service hallelujah because
[1:46:44] without that betrayal there'd be no
[1:46:46] Calvary and no Calvary there's no
[1:46:48] forgiveness of sense and no forgiveness
[1:46:51] since is no God dwelling at a people and
[1:46:53] if there's none of that there's no
[1:46:54] rapture hallelujah it's all things work
