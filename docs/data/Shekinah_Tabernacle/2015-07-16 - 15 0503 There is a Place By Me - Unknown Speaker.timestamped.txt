[1:21] good morning
[1:23] everybody Welcome to the house of the
[1:26] Lord amen it's good to be here it's good
[1:28] to um like I always say it's good good
[1:30] to be in an atmosphere an environment
[1:32] where the spirit of God can um feel
[1:34] welcome no doubt you know many of us
[1:37] have different environments during the
[1:39] week that um unfortunately the spirit of
[1:42] God isn't welcome there so it's it's
[1:45] sometimes you get caught in the hustle
[1:46] and bustle and it's hard to you know
[1:48] just be sensitive and hear from the Lord
[1:49] but it's nice to be in a place like this
[1:50] where we can hear from the Lord be
[1:52] refreshed and like always encouraged we
[1:54] want to U make the most of it that we
[1:57] can lay hold on the opportunity that we
[1:59] have to to to let God speak to us and to
[2:02] to be in the place where we can grow a
[2:05] we bit more you know often think if
[2:08] God's the great Creator and uh what we
[2:11] call the Potter then the best thing that
[2:13] we can do with our lives is let him work
[2:15] on us and unfortunately when we're doing
[2:18] a lot of things and hustle and bustle he
[2:19] can't really work on us it's when we get
[2:21] in the still quiet times and God can
[2:23] speak to us that he can change our lives
[2:26] just why he he may speak to us about
[2:27] something that we're doing or something
[2:29] that we we're like or any way that he
[2:31] might do it to actually help us and when
[2:33] we when when he speaks to us and he he
[2:35] tells us a small thing that may just be
[2:37] a little piece of the puzzle in our life
[2:38] that make us a wee bit better and and we
[2:41] can get that in our quiet time in prayer
[2:43] we can get that in church here we can
[2:44] get that when we when we put effort into
[2:47] letting him deal with us so um I believe
[2:51] we're going to have a good time this

[50:01] handy if you wouldd like to stand with
[50:02] me and we'll just read a couple of
[50:04] scriptures
[50:06] um I want to read from numbers and then
[50:09] we'll go to the uh so Numbers chapter
[50:12] 27 and we'll read the first uh eight
[50:14] verses and then also we want to go to
[50:16] Exodus chapter
[50:21] 33
[50:23] amen yes so numbers 27 and verse one
[50:27] um I'd like to
[50:30] speak uh I'd like to speak this morning
[50:33] about uh there is a place by me there's
[50:36] a place by me and we'll get that from uh
[50:38] a scripture in Exodus 33 but I want to
[50:40] read this here from numbers 27 as well
[50:43] so it says here from verse
[50:45] one it says then came the daughters of
[50:49] zelop fed the son of of hea the son of
[50:52] Gilead the son of of of uh Mech the son
[50:57] of Manasseh families of Manasseh the son
[50:59] of Joseph these are the names of his
[51:02] daughters Mara Noah hogla uh milka and
[51:07] and uh
[51:09] Tia and they stood before Moses and
[51:11] before alaza the priest and before the
[51:13] princes and all the congregation by the
[51:14] door of the Tabernacle of the
[51:16] congregation saying our father died in
[51:18] the wilderness and he was not in the
[51:20] company of them that gathered themselves
[51:22] together against the Lord in the company
[51:24] of Kora but he died in his own sin and
[51:26] had no
[51:27] Sons why should the name of our father
[51:29] be done away from among his family
[51:31] because he had no son give us therefore
[51:33] a possession among the Brethren of our
[51:35] father and Moses brought their cause
[51:38] before the Lord and the Lord spake unto
[51:39] Moses saying the daughters of zelop had
[51:42] speak right Thou shalt surely give them
[51:44] a possession for for an inheritance
[51:47] among their father's Brethren and thou
[51:49] shalt cause the inheritance of their
[51:51] father to pass unto them and thou shalt
[51:53] speak unto the children of Israel saying
[51:55] if a man die and have no son
[51:57] then you shall cause his inheritance to
[51:59] pass under his
[52:00] daughter and then uh we'll go to Exodus
[52:03] chapter
[52:05] 33 now that may seem well we'll just
[52:08] read this and then we'll um that may
[52:11] seem an unusual reading but I want to
[52:14] take something uh from
[52:16] it and
[52:22] um so Exodus chapter
[52:25] 33 and we'll read from verse 13 I trust
[52:28] this is your heart's
[52:29] desire so this is Moses speaking to
[52:33] God maybe we'll read from verse 12 and
[52:35] Moses said unto the Lord see thou saith
[52:38] unto me bring up this people and thou
[52:40] Hast not let me know whom thou will send
[52:42] with
[52:43] me yet thou Hast said I Know Thee by
[52:46] name and thou Hast also found Grace in
[52:48] my sight now therefore I pray thee if I
[52:50] have found Grace in thy sight show me
[52:52] thy way that I may Know Thee that I may
[52:55] par me find Gra in thy sight and
[52:57] consider that this nation is thy people
[53:00] and he said my presence shall go with
[53:01] thee and I will give thee rest and he
[53:04] said unto him If thy presence go not
[53:05] with me carry us not from hence for
[53:09] wherein shall it be known here that I
[53:11] and thy people have found Grace in thy
[53:13] sight is it not in that thou goest with
[53:16] us so shall we be separated I and thy
[53:19] people from all the people that are upon
[53:21] the face of the earth and the Lord said
[53:23] unto Moses I will do this thing also
[53:25] that thou Hast spoken for thou Hast
[53:27] found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee
[53:29] by name and he said beseech thee show me
[53:32] thy glory and he said I'll make all my
[53:35] goodness pass before thee and I'll
[53:37] procla proclaim the name of the Lord
[53:38] before thee and will be gracious to whom
[53:41] I will be gracious and will show Mercy
[53:43] on whom I will show mercy and he said
[53:45] thou canest not see my face for thou for
[53:49] shall no man see me and live and the
[53:52] Lord said behold there is a place by me
[53:55] and thou shalt stand Upon A Rock Amen
[53:59] may the Lord bless his word you may be
[54:01] seated amen so I really want to take a
[54:05] uh yeah so my subject I want to talk
[54:06] about is there is a place by me now it
[54:10] may seem like the two texts that we read
[54:12] don't really go together but I want to
[54:14] show that our POS but but our possession
[54:17] and our position or place is actually
[54:19] one and the same now a
[54:21] possession is something seized or it's
[54:25] um you know something that you actually
[54:26] have it's a possession something that
[54:28] belongs to you and these these um five
[54:32] these five daughters here um I would I
[54:34] would like to uh call them like the wise
[54:37] the wise virgin from Matthew 25 who had
[54:39] oil in their lamps because they wanted
[54:41] because the the children of God so not
[54:45] the not the foolish like the foolish
[54:46] virgin but the wise ones they want what
[54:48] God has for them they want to actually
[54:50] possess what God has actually given them
[54:53] and and these daughters even though it
[54:54] wasn't written in in the at that time
[54:57] they knew that part of the land actually
[54:59] rightfully belonged to them because it
[55:01] would have belonged to their fathers so
[55:02] they actually made a as we read they
[55:04] they came before Moses and before Alazar
[55:06] and they said give us a possession and
[55:09] they they were granted a possession in
[55:11] the promised land and in the promised
[55:13] land it's very important because the
[55:14] promised land was the only place of the
[55:16] Resurrection there was no Resurrection
[55:18] in Egypt there's no Resurrection
[55:20] somewhere else but it was in the
[55:21] promised land there was the resurrection
[55:23] that's why Jacob you know you know he
[55:25] was buried there Joseph said concerning
[55:27] his bones don't leave me down in Egypt
[55:29] bury me in the promised land they were
[55:31] prophets they were spiritual they knew
[55:33] that there was the resurrection was
[55:35] going to be in the promised land they
[55:36] knew where Abraham bought the piece of
[55:38] ground and buried Sarah you know in that
[55:41] area was going to be the resurrection
[55:42] and that's why they were they were
[55:44] buried there and so the spiritual among
[55:47] Israel knew that that land was more than
[55:49] just a land flowing with milk and honey
[55:51] but they knew the resurrection would
[55:52] take place in that land so to have a
[55:54] possession in that land was every
[55:56] it was more than having nice Vineyards
[55:58] having more than having a nice house or
[56:01] having a nice family life but if they
[56:03] knew if they if they entered into their
[56:04] possession that God had given them they
[56:06] would come up in the Resurrection The
[56:08] True Believer would so to be in that in
[56:10] that possession that's why I believe
[56:12] those five daughters they went to Moses
[56:14] say give us a possession in this land
[56:16] because they knew that part of it
[56:17] belonged to them and the and the
[56:19] promised land for us we know is the Holy
[56:21] Ghost it is not a piece of land but it
[56:23] is actually our position in Christ and
[56:25] if we can trly see that our rest is in
[56:27] him the resurrection hey the
[56:29] resurrection is not knowing the Bible
[56:31] only the resurrection isn't just knowing
[56:33] quotes the resurrection isn't just
[56:35] coming to church but the resurrection is
[56:37] to know him to know him is to have life
[56:39] and if you don't know him you have
[56:41] nothing you failed miserably but to have
[56:43] him is to have everything and so it
[56:45] takes God to make the word live because
[56:47] when he when he quickens the word to
[56:48] your heart that is him speaking to you
[56:50] that is him actually revealing himself
[56:52] to you and he's doing it for a purpose
[56:54] because he is a place by him I have a
[56:56] place by me and that place must be full
[56:59] and he has his intent is to take you
[57:01] from from your place and I'll show you
[57:03] it's it's a place is more than just a
[57:06] you know it's more than just well I live
[57:08] in this place I go to this place for
[57:10] work but the definition of this word
[57:12] place it means so it means so it means
[57:16] um properly a standing that is a spot so
[57:18] it's wisely used as a locality but also
[57:21] figuratively it is a condition of body
[57:24] or mind so it's a that's a condition so
[57:28] when when Paul says that we have been
[57:30] translated into the kingdom of his dear
[57:32] son he's speaking to people upon the
[57:33] Earth he's saying you've actually been
[57:35] moved because that word translation is
[57:37] to move from one place to another so
[57:39] it's not to like translate words but
[57:41] it's actually I've been translated I've
[57:43] been moved so so the believer who's
[57:45] truly met God and God has transformed
[57:47] their life and all they want to do is
[57:49] serve him and serve his you know serve
[57:52] him with everything that's in him you
[57:53] know there's a life and it's not them
[57:54] doing it they know it's not them but God
[57:56] is in them and God is living the
[57:57] Christian Life out of them I say those
[57:59] people have been translated Hallelujah
[58:02] if if you have met him I tell you you
[58:04] are not in the Kingdom of this world
[58:05] anymore but you've been translated from
[58:07] this Kingdom of this world into the
[58:09] kingdom of God you've been moved to a
[58:11] different place you've been moved to a
[58:13] different condition entirely different
[58:15] condition that's why the believer is a
[58:17] hey we can't help being different we
[58:19] can't helping different you know it's
[58:21] not a bunch of rules and regulations do
[58:23] this don't do this hey the spirit of God
[58:25] in a Believer makes him totally a
[58:27] different person doesn't matter what
[58:29] skin color where they're from age that's
[58:31] irrelevant but the spiritual condition
[58:33] of someone that's truly been born again
[58:35] more than just anointed by the spirit
[58:37] but God comes and dwells in them that
[58:39] condition that person hate they can't
[58:40] help being different because if there's
[58:42] a life in you that that that just just
[58:44] something in you says I can't do that
[58:46] anymore I just don't like that anymore
[58:48] but now I love these things and people
[58:50] look at you say you've gone mad well
[58:52] actually no you haven't G mad you found
[58:53] your mind you have the mind of Christ
[58:55] you we come to your senses Hallelujah so
[58:59] now we have been we have been moved to a
[59:02] different
[59:03] place Hallelujah we've been changed
[59:06] we've been moved there's a place by him
[59:09] so they wanted their position be um uh
[59:11] their position because they knew the the
[59:13] resurrection was in that
[59:14] land now we are in a season now where
[59:17] God is causing everyone to come to their
[59:20] place amen everyone this is this is a
[59:22] manifestation time this is a harvest
[59:24] time and God has causing doesn't matter
[59:27] evil Good Wicked righteous whatever
[59:31] whatever the cuz God knows the end from
[59:33] the
[59:34] beginning now we know we have free moral
[59:36] agency but he knows who's going to be
[59:38] there and who's not going to be there
[59:38] ultimately but he actually gives you the
[59:42] choice you look through the Bible you
[59:45] look through the Bible and and even
[59:46] prophets have been given Visions but
[59:48] it's up to the people to fulfill that
[59:49] Vision you take the prophet that goes to
[59:51] the king I think it's Elisha he you know
[59:53] you read in Second Kings there he's he
[59:56] he's uh got the sickness that he's going
[59:57] to die with and then he and then either
[1:00:00] the king visits him or or he's going to
[1:00:01] get visited by the king and then and
[1:00:04] then this Prophet says fire an arrow out
[1:00:05] of the window he says it's the it's the
[1:00:08] arrow of the Deliverance of the Lord and
[1:00:10] then and then take the arrows and smite
[1:00:12] the ground and the King only smites the
[1:00:14] ground three times and this Prophet was
[1:00:15] mad he says why don't you smite it more
[1:00:17] than three cuz you but now you'll only
[1:00:19] beat the enemy three times so the
[1:00:21] prophet saw it in a vision the potential
[1:00:24] of what could have happened yeah it was
[1:00:26] up for the people in that who were
[1:00:29] actually in the vision to live it out
[1:00:32] accordingly y so now it's the same thing
[1:00:36] God actually gives us free moral choice
[1:00:39] are we going to go free or we going to
[1:00:41] stay bound because now if there is a if
[1:00:44] we are called to actually take our
[1:00:46] position hey if God if you're the Bride
[1:00:48] of Jesus Christ you always were the
[1:00:50] Bride of Jesus Christ if you are meant
[1:00:52] to be a be in a place next to him a
[1:00:55] place by me God ordained you to stand in
[1:00:57] that place it's only by his grace we
[1:00:59] could ever stand with him and so but if
[1:01:02] but if that is the case then that means
[1:01:04] that the devil has to let go chains have
[1:01:06] to be broken unbelief has to be driven
[1:01:09] out Satan has to be cast out of out of
[1:01:12] every heart of the bride and God has to
[1:01:14] take up residence so there has to be a
[1:01:16] loosing now there has to be a release of
[1:01:18] God's people and we are living in that
[1:01:21] time of release we are living in that
[1:01:22] time of Jubilee where everyone that that
[1:01:25] is ordained and wants to go free shall
[1:01:27] Go free and everyone that is bound shall
[1:01:29] not stay bound and I want to read this
[1:01:32] here from Leviticus 25 we'll just let's
[1:01:34] just read this because this is all part
[1:01:36] of us going to another place being being
[1:01:38] changed from the kingdom of this world
[1:01:40] to the kingdom of our
[1:01:42] God now we go to Leviticus
[1:01:48] 25 we are at the end of all
[1:01:51] things everything must come to its
[1:01:53] position everything must come to its
[1:01:54] maturity everything good and bad you
[1:01:58] know the devil you know his his work is
[1:02:01] coming to its maturity and so God's work
[1:02:04] is coming to its
[1:02:06] maturity
[1:02:08] so now if we read from verse 9 now it
[1:02:12] says then Thou shalt cause the trumpet
[1:02:13] of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day
[1:02:15] of the seventh month in the day of
[1:02:17] atonement shall they make the trumpet
[1:02:19] sound throughout all your land and you
[1:02:21] shall Hall the 50th year and Proclaim
[1:02:23] Liberty throughout all the land and um
[1:02:26] sorry and Proclaim Liberty throughout
[1:02:27] all the land unto all the inhabitants
[1:02:29] thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you
[1:02:31] and you shall return every man unto his
[1:02:33] possession and you shall return every
[1:02:35] man unto his family a jubilee shall be
[1:02:38] that 50th year be unto you you shall not
[1:02:40] sow neither reap that which growth of
[1:02:43] itself in it neither GA neither gather
[1:02:45] the grapes in it of thy wine undressed
[1:02:48] for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy
[1:02:50] unto you you shall eat the increase
[1:02:51] thereof out of the field in the year of
[1:02:53] this Jubilee you shall return every man
[1:02:55] under his possession so it now so here
[1:02:59] comes a season now just in the Old
[1:03:01] Testament type that here comes a season
[1:03:02] now where every slave every Bond man
[1:03:05] every Bond woman must return to what
[1:03:07] belongs to them and we understand to be
[1:03:09] redeemed as you are redeemed back to
[1:03:10] your original estate you're actually
[1:03:12] taken back to where you should have been
[1:03:14] in the first place so so if you have
[1:03:16] been redeemed God is actually because
[1:03:18] when you're born you're not in the
[1:03:19] condition you're meant to be in but in
[1:03:21] you was a life that was going to come
[1:03:23] forth and we're not talking about your
[1:03:24] natural life we're talking about God
[1:03:25] God's eternal life and so but there came
[1:03:28] a season now where God Came Upon your
[1:03:30] sin and God spoke to your heart and you
[1:03:33] begin to recognized I'm more than just a
[1:03:35] person living upon this Earth I'm more
[1:03:37] than a dad or a wife or a husband or you
[1:03:40] know or a mom or whatever it was but I'm
[1:03:41] a child of God and so and God what he's
[1:03:44] doing now is he's actually saying now
[1:03:46] I've set you at Liberty and he begins to
[1:03:48] enforce now upon the believer their
[1:03:50] rights that they are free that the devil
[1:03:52] must let go of all of God's children and
[1:03:55] that everything that the devil tries to
[1:03:57] hold against you must stricken off that
[1:03:59] is a Year of Jubilee because when a
[1:04:01] slave became a slave he had all this
[1:04:03] debt he said I got to sell myself into
[1:04:06] slavery because I have this debt and I
[1:04:08] cannot pay it and we had a debt we could
[1:04:10] not owe we had a debt we could not pay
[1:04:13] we needed someone to take all of our sin
[1:04:15] away we needed someone to actually to
[1:04:18] actually set us free Hallelujah and
[1:04:21] that's exactly that's why we just sung
[1:04:22] the song because Jesus came God came
[1:04:24] down cuz he knew know no man could pay
[1:04:26] the debt didn't matter how sincere they
[1:04:28] were didn't matter how much they read
[1:04:30] the Bible didn't matter how much they
[1:04:31] prayed or they went to the temple and
[1:04:33] they offered sacrifices hey they still
[1:04:35] packed a sin debt amen they were still
[1:04:38] actually slaves to that first nature to
[1:04:40] that sin nature but then Jesus came and
[1:04:43] he broke those chains and now he has
[1:04:45] come to tell you today this morning you
[1:04:47] don't have to yield yourself to sin
[1:04:49] nature anymore you don't have to yield
[1:04:51] yourself to unbelief but you can walk in
[1:04:53] Liberty this morning that you you you
[1:04:55] can walk in the way God has already
[1:04:57] intended you to be you just have to let
[1:04:59] him do it hey they heard the trumpet
[1:05:01] they could say well my Master's pretty
[1:05:03] nice he's been good to me this year
[1:05:06] maybe I'll stay with him you know the
[1:05:08] outside world's scary I don't really
[1:05:09] know where my possession is I got a lot
[1:05:12] of work to do I've got to you know
[1:05:13] rebuild the walls I've got to rearrange
[1:05:15] my possession you know my Master's good
[1:05:17] to me that's how the devil likes to
[1:05:19] paint the picture to you he
[1:05:22] said it's really not that bad I'm a good
[1:05:26] person I haven't killed anyone haven't
[1:05:28] raped anyone haven't murdered any you
[1:05:30] know I haven't done anything too bad in
[1:05:31] society I'm a good person and that's the
[1:05:34] devil trying to paint a picture just
[1:05:35] stay with me everything's fine with me
[1:05:37] amen hey he's a liar don't live below
[1:05:41] your privilege hallelujah amen don't be
[1:05:43] a slave to anything anymore Hallelujah
[1:05:46] just let it go he say I can't overcome
[1:05:48] this thing you're not meant to overcome
[1:05:49] it let him overcome it you got to yield
[1:05:52] yourself and say I'm the clay hey do we
[1:05:54] have a bunch of clay here are you the
[1:05:56] clay who's the Potter you're not the
[1:05:59] Potter he's the Potter he said when you
[1:06:01] say Potter mold me shape me and be
[1:06:04] willing to him to just rearrange your
[1:06:06] life because if you yield to him he'll
[1:06:08] do it if you don't yield he won't do it
[1:06:11] he's a gentleman that's right but he
[1:06:13] wants you to be free today because we
[1:06:15] are in a time where everything's coming
[1:06:17] to its position everything's coming to
[1:06:18] its maturity and so the Bride of Jesus
[1:06:21] Christ must come to her position she
[1:06:23] must come to a place by him amen he he
[1:06:27] she must be elevated now from from the
[1:06:29] sin of this world and just being a
[1:06:31] church member who knows a bunch of
[1:06:32] Doctrine to a living where God comes and
[1:06:35] lives in her and the Very life that was
[1:06:37] in him is now in her and he has
[1:06:39] preeminence over her and she does
[1:06:41] everything that pleases him amen we're
[1:06:43] in that season friends of adoption of
[1:06:46] the placing of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:48] this is the season we're living in yes
[1:06:50] sir and adoption in the Bible if you
[1:06:52] read the book of Galatians he uh Paul
[1:06:54] speaks about adop op and it's not like
[1:06:56] Western world where we think we go to
[1:06:58] China we go to Russia we we go down the
[1:07:00] street there's some awful child who is
[1:07:02] not born into our family and then we
[1:07:04] bring it into the family that's not
[1:07:06] adoption in the Bible speak Bible
[1:07:08] language is the adoption is the placing
[1:07:10] of a son the placing of a child so
[1:07:12] there's a child that is Born Into the
[1:07:14] family and then there comes a season in
[1:07:16] its life where the the father is pleased
[1:07:20] and then now the father places that
[1:07:22] child and says everything they say
[1:07:24] everything they do as good as me doing
[1:07:26] it that is adoption and we're in that
[1:07:29] season of adoption friends we're in that
[1:07:31] season where God is taking a people and
[1:07:33] he is placing her because he's pleased
[1:07:36] in her Hallelujah he is pleased in what
[1:07:39] she does he is pleased in how she lives
[1:07:42] he is pleased in everything hey he says
[1:07:44] devil look at this woman behold this
[1:07:46] woman upon the Earth there's none like

[1:08:09] righteous as God is holy and righteous
[1:08:12] that's right amen am he became me that I
[1:08:16] might become him by works no by Grace
[1:08:20] amen but you have to be willing yes amen
[1:08:24] you see in the scripture you you you
[1:08:26] read in the Old
[1:08:27] Testament they told to do certain things
[1:08:30] you take you take
[1:08:32] um um you take the Book of Judges you
[1:08:35] know you take uh
[1:08:37] Gideon obedience led to the Supernatural
[1:08:40] coming upon the scene the angel visited
[1:08:42] him and the angel said you know uh you
[1:08:45] God said you know you know gives him an
[1:08:48] offering and then Gideon his eyes come
[1:08:50] up and he recognizes this was actually
[1:08:51] God speaking to him he says he down the
[1:08:54] altar in your father's house take the
[1:08:56] Bullocks and make it into a sacrifice so
[1:08:59] he had to be obedient in those things
[1:09:02] and then God Came Upon the scene even
[1:09:03] more yes am you see it all through the
[1:09:06] Old Testament Moses Moses you know to
[1:09:09] build the Tabernacle he had to build the
[1:09:11] Tabernacle according to how he saw it
[1:09:13] God showed him a vision this is how it
[1:09:15] is this is the dimensions this is how
[1:09:16] it's all meant to be all the way down to
[1:09:18] the priests uh garments and all these
[1:09:20] things and when he did that God came
[1:09:23] down and dwelt in that Tabernacle God
[1:09:25] actually allowed man to build him a
[1:09:26] house Solomon the same thing he so so
[1:09:30] they are obedient to the to what God put
[1:09:32] upon their hearts and they did what God
[1:09:34] Said and God came down and lived through
[1:09:36] that amen see obedience always leads to
[1:09:39] the supernatural God living that's right
[1:09:42] Hallelujah but it all begins where God
[1:09:45] says do this and you do this then God
[1:09:48] comes
[1:09:49] down amen hey you see it you just go
[1:09:52] through all the Old Testament Hallelujah

[1:10:46] great plan what he thought in his mind
[1:10:47] now is manifesting upon the Earth this
[1:10:50] was in his thoughts before the
[1:10:51] foundation of the world and then finally
[1:10:53] his time has gone he's allotted his word
[1:10:54] he said the law and he told told Noah to
[1:10:57] build the ark then he sent the law then
[1:10:59] the prophets came and then John the
[1:11:00] Baptist came these were all in his
[1:11:02] thoughts then finally he came upon the
[1:11:04] Earth himself as was prophesied
[1:11:07] hallelujah amen then then he paid
[1:11:09] redemption's price and then and then
[1:11:11] Peter James and John the apostles They
[1:11:13] Came Upon the earth and the book of Acts
[1:11:15] was lived hey that was all in God's mind

[1:11:58] onto that but you know this is what God
[1:12:01] has been waiting for so when we say Lord
[1:12:04] I want you to live hey he's I've been
[1:12:06] waiting for you to ask me to come cuz he
[1:12:09] always comes where he's
[1:12:10] invited amen amen
[1:12:14] hallelujah so now we're in a Year of
[1:12:17] Jubilee
[1:12:20] now
[1:12:21] Joshua Joshua you know if we go let's go
[1:12:25] to Joshua chapter
[1:12:27] 5 I just want to lay some things out
[1:12:30] there maybe we'll go to the book of
[1:12:31] Ephesians but
[1:12:43] um so now we come to a season where
[1:12:45] Moses had a desire Show Me Your Glory it
[1:12:48] says there's a place by me and I'll set
[1:12:50] you upon a
[1:12:51] rock and but then God's work still had
[1:12:55] to unfold more and someone had to take
[1:12:57] them into the land and here comes Joshua
[1:12:59] no doubt Joshua would have had a great
[1:13:01] burden because he seen God work mly
[1:13:03] through Moses and and and he knew all
[1:13:05] moses' testimonies and he knew what it
[1:13:07] was like to go through the Red Sea and
[1:13:09] he knew what it was like to see the
[1:13:11] death angel you know that night where
[1:13:12] they put the blood on the door and the
[1:13:14] ltil and hearing the screams of the
[1:13:15] Egyptians but maybe the rejoicing of the
[1:13:17] children of Israel he knew what that was
[1:13:19] all like but now it was his time it was
[1:13:22] his time to take up the word for himself
[1:13:24] and make it live this was his burden now
[1:13:27] because you know we can all Rejoice oh
[1:13:29] brother Braham did this and this person
[1:13:30] did this and this Old Saint did this and
[1:13:33] what a wonderful testimony of this
[1:13:34] person but then when it comes into your
[1:13:36] lamp and now it's your season to live
[1:13:38] this out hey this would have been his
[1:13:40] burden because he could have said you
[1:13:42] know being there with Moses he would
[1:13:43] have said of course yeah Moses we're
[1:13:44] going to take the land God's given us
[1:13:46] the land but then now it falls on his
[1:13:48] lap and now it's his responsibility to
[1:13:50] live out his portion of the
[1:13:52] word but I want you to see here now in
[1:13:55] Jo uh this is in Joshua chapter 5 we
[1:13:57] read from verse 13 down to
[1:13:59] 15 and it came to pass see see so
[1:14:03] they're at Jericho they don't have any
[1:14:05] Siege equipment physically it's
[1:14:07] impossible for them to take the city
[1:14:09] physically yes and so
[1:14:12] now you know he's thinking how am I
[1:14:14] going to do this God's given us the land
[1:14:17] now how's it going to be lived out if
[1:14:19] you can just you know if it just sinks
[1:14:21] into your heart God's given me all
[1:14:23] things there's there's not every devil
[1:14:25] must be under my feet amen amen
[1:14:28] everything that the devil tries to put
[1:14:29] against me must be under my feet in
[1:14:31] subjection to me so so I trust you
[1:14:33] believe that with all your heart but now
[1:14:35] you say how's this going to live out
[1:14:37] amen amen because we have to take our
[1:14:38] Promised Land as well and so here in
[1:14:41] Joshua 5 it says and it came to pass
[1:14:43] when Joshua was by Jericho he lifted up
[1:14:45] his eyes and looked and behold there
[1:14:47] stood a man over against them with a
[1:14:48] sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went
[1:14:51] unto him and said unto him art thou for
[1:14:53] us or for our adversaries
[1:14:55] and he said nay but as the captain of
[1:14:57] the Lord's host I uh am I now come and
[1:15:00] Joshua fell on his face on to the Earth
[1:15:03] and did worship and said unto him what
[1:15:05] saith my Lord unto his servant and the
[1:15:08] captain of the Lord's host said unto
[1:15:10] Joshua loose thy foot a shoe off thy
[1:15:12] foot for the place on thou standest is
[1:15:14] Holy and Joshua did so so now here comes
[1:15:17] so so he's the leader of Israel this
[1:15:19] great burden he's got to place the
[1:15:20] people in in their land but then God
[1:15:23] comes upon the scene as the captain of
[1:15:24] the Lord host and he tells Joshua you
[1:15:27] know I'm not for you I'm not against you
[1:15:28] I'm here to take over this battle I'm
[1:15:30] here to come and place the people in the
[1:15:32] land that's what he's telling I'm I'm
[1:15:34] I'm actually taking your leadership and
[1:15:35] I'm putting you under my leadership and
[1:15:37] I'm going to lead you into the promised
[1:15:39] land and when God comes upon the scene
[1:15:41] like this it's when people come into
[1:15:43] their possession because he was the
[1:15:45] angel of the Lord came down to Moses and
[1:15:47] he said there is a place in the promised
[1:15:49] land that these people must go to and so
[1:15:51] now their inheritance they were about to
[1:15:53] receive their inheritance and those
[1:15:55] people those churches in the land those
[1:15:58] denominations in the land those
[1:16:00] Philistines and all the people in the
[1:16:01] promised land they thought it belonged
[1:16:03] to them and they laid claim to it they
[1:16:05] could have gone back hundreds of years
[1:16:07] and say our forbear he built this city
[1:16:09] and then he built this city and he made
[1:16:11] this nation and this is why we're here
[1:16:13] but then but in God's eyes they had no
[1:16:16] right they had no right to the promised
[1:16:18] land they had no real claim hallelujah
[1:16:22] it's the same thing with you and I the
[1:16:23] devil might say it doesn't belong to you
[1:16:25] the days of Miracles has passed God
[1:16:27] doesn't live in that way anymore and you
[1:16:29] just tell them you're a liar amen you
[1:16:32] tell them you tell them exactly you say
[1:16:34] that's a lie my God said he be with me
[1:16:36] even in me to the end of the world and
[1:16:38] the things that I do you shall do also
[1:16:40] and greater than this shall you do
[1:16:42] because I go to my father amen so he has
[1:16:45] no right the devil can try and say this
[1:16:47] belong this because hey this Earth You
[1:16:50] Know Why the world is in chaos do you
[1:16:52] know why the world's in chaos because
[1:16:54] the the kingdom of God is being
[1:16:56] established in the hearts of the Bride
[1:16:57] of Jesus Christ and two kingdoms cannot
[1:16:59] be here at the same time and so now a a
[1:17:03] you know brother Braham he he he takes a
[1:17:05] word I can't remember where from uh like
[1:17:07] the kingdom of God it's actually the
[1:17:08] Messianic Empire it's in the scripture
[1:17:11] so I say now the Messianic Empire the
[1:17:13] kingdom of God is being established so
[1:17:15] now the kingdom of Satan is shaking amen
[1:17:18] the kingdom of of Satan is falling apart
[1:17:21] Because of You amen amen cuz the bride
[1:17:23] is coming to her position
[1:17:25] two empires cannot be here at the same
[1:17:27] time two Willers cannot stand at the
[1:17:29] same time because those two national
[1:17:31] Spirits are fighting for dominance and
[1:17:33] it's the same thing in the you know in
[1:17:35] the religious realm where the the spirit
[1:17:37] of God in his bride is fighting for
[1:17:39] dominance against the spirit of Satan
[1:17:41] and his Antichrist religions and his
[1:17:44] kingdom Must Fall because it's
[1:17:45] prophesied it shall fall and the Bride
[1:17:47] of Jesus Christ must Ascend to her
[1:17:49] position because it's prophesied you
[1:17:51] shall Ascend you shall be placed in the
[1:17:54] place that God has ordained you to be
[1:17:56] Hallelujah that's where you know God is
[1:17:57] ordained he says there's a place by me
[1:18:00] and you know what husband here or wife
[1:18:05] would not want their spouse by
[1:18:07] them amen come here honey stand next to
[1:18:10] me cuz I'm proud of you I want you to be
[1:18:12] next near me I want to show you off
[1:18:15] hallelujah amen what do you think God
[1:18:17] wants to do he want to say look at this
[1:18:20] woman amen that I have loved with a
[1:18:22] Everlasting Love that I have redeemed
[1:18:25] Hallelujah that I may join ears with me
[1:18:28] amen look at her hey Hallelujah so he is
[1:18:33] determined there is a place by him and
[1:18:35] he's determined you shall stand in that
[1:18:37] place and we'll come to it in
[1:18:39] Revelations amen so we have called now
[1:18:42] the devil's kingdom is falling because
[1:18:44] he is falling and the reason is because
[1:18:47] you're ascending hey every every you can
[1:18:50] look back in your life and things that
[1:18:52] used to bother you after you're saved
[1:18:54] now but things that used to bother you
[1:18:56] complexes traits in your life that
[1:18:58] you're not proud of now now when they
[1:19:00] used to rule you you rule them
[1:19:03] Hallelujah things that used to bother
[1:19:04] you in your personality or things pass
[1:19:06] down from generation to generation
[1:19:09] finally God comes and breaks that cycle
[1:19:11] and you defeat that devil hallelujah
[1:19:14] amen she can and what is that you're
[1:19:16] taking your Promised Land you're taking
[1:19:17] your inheritance amen and you're
[1:19:20] ascending that's you ascending because
[1:19:22] you're putting these things these things
[1:19:23] are put under your feet
[1:19:25] and they don't rule you anymore but you
[1:19:26] rule them and the thing that rules is
[1:19:28] always on top hallelujah amen so we're
[1:19:32] ascending that's why I say the bride is
[1:19:34] ascending to her rightful
[1:19:36] position now if we go ahead to
[1:19:39] Revelations chapter 3 we'll read a
[1:19:42] couple of scriptures here at the end of
[1:19:43] the um end of the chapter
[1:19:56] and we'll read here from uh verse 21 and
[1:19:58] 22 now
[1:20:00] remember that this is this is God
[1:20:03] speaking to the last Church age and we
[1:20:05] are living in that church age amen uh
[1:20:08] all the blessings that God says to him
[1:20:09] that overcometh because he says to every
[1:20:11] age to him that overcometh I'll Grant
[1:20:13] this I'll give you this and all those
[1:20:16] blessings are added down Through the
[1:20:18] Ages but this is our um so all the
[1:20:22] other all of the Bride through all the
[1:20:24] ages will sit with him as we are granted
[1:20:27] but you see now he's saying now he's
[1:20:29] saying there is a place where you shall
[1:20:31] be he's saying to him that overcometh
[1:20:33] will I grant to sit with me in my Throne
[1:20:35] now Throne is a place even as I overcame
[1:20:38] and him sat down with my father in his
[1:20:40] throne he says he that hath an ear let
[1:20:42] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:20:44] churches so he say to him that
[1:20:45] overcometh there is a place by me and
[1:20:48] you shall sit in that place that's what
[1:20:51] he's saying I'm saying there is a there
[1:20:53] is a prepared place for you
[1:20:55] you
[1:20:57] now because we you know we read here and
[1:21:00] maybe we just go to Isaiah 66 I just
[1:21:02] want to read um just a few more
[1:21:04] scriptures here we have here in Isaiah
[1:21:10] 66 God says this now cuz remember so
[1:21:13] this is the heart of God so it's not
[1:21:15] it's not the heart of man being revealed
[1:21:17] this is the heart of God and he says
[1:21:18] here in Isaiah 66 and
[1:21:20] verse1 it says thus sayith the Lord says
[1:21:23] what saying he is determined because
[1:21:24] it's a harvest time he has determined
[1:21:26] now that you'll be free of everything
[1:21:28] and you'll come to your rightful
[1:21:30] place amen amen you see when when the
[1:21:34] angel of the Lord was there with Joshua
[1:21:35] with Moses he was determined now that
[1:21:37] the people in the land would be
[1:21:39] dispossessed and the children of Israel
[1:21:41] would take their rightful inheritance
[1:21:43] and it caused everyone to come in their
[1:21:45] rightful position he did and so is the
[1:21:48] same thing today we have the angel of
[1:21:50] the Lord has appeared to us God has come
[1:21:51] down and now he has determined where
[1:21:54] will take our inheritance this is a time
[1:21:56] where the bride receives everything that
[1:21:58] belongs to her amen they says in Isaiah
[1:22:01] 66 and verse one thus sayith the Lord
[1:22:03] the heaven is my throne and Earth is my
[1:22:06] foot stol where is the house that you
[1:22:08] build unto me and where is the place of
[1:22:10] my rest and we see where um I think
[1:22:13] Stephan picks us up he says how be it
[1:22:14] the most high dwelleth not in temples
[1:22:16] made with hands as saith the prophet
[1:22:19] Heaven is my throne and the Earth is my
[1:22:20] foot stol what house will you build me
[1:22:22] sayith the Lord or what is the place of
[1:22:24] my rest and Paul picks it up and says
[1:22:27] what know you not that your body is the
[1:22:28] Temple of the Holy Ghost uh which is in
[1:22:31] you which you have of God and you're not
[1:22:33] of your own so God is actually saying
[1:22:36] where is the place of my rest he's
[1:22:37] saying where are my children where where
[1:22:40] is my bride that I can find a resting
[1:22:42] place in her soul that's what he's
[1:22:43] saying Heaven is my Throne Earth is my
[1:22:46] foot stol but where is the place of my
[1:22:47] rest where's my family where's my loved
[1:22:50] ones where's my dear ones that I want to
[1:22:52] gather to me that's what he's throwing
[1:22:53] that's what he's asking that's his great
[1:22:55] burden I made the heavens and the earth
[1:22:57] I made all things but where is the place
[1:22:59] of my rest where is my elected lady
[1:23:02] Hallelujah where's the one I can dwell
[1:23:04] in and and God can actually put skin on
[1:23:07] him once again he hey he takes your body
[1:23:09] and God has veiled in
[1:23:11] flesh amen amen hey that that's that's
[1:23:14] not too big to chew hey if God dwells in
[1:23:17] you God has put on flesh once again the
[1:23:20] word has been made flesh once
[1:23:22] again amen amen and the Bride of Jesus
[1:23:25] Christ the word has been made
[1:23:27] flesh
[1:23:29] hallelujah amen that's right brother
[1:23:31] Peter says that you are you you're
[1:23:33] Lively Stones living stones made into
[1:23:36] the temple of God am Hallelujah and the
[1:23:38] reason you're living is because God
[1:23:40] lives in you and God has placed us
[1:23:42] together in our place amen hallelujah we
[1:23:45] are the Temple of the Living God by one
[1:23:48] Spirit we're baptized into one body
[1:23:50] that's what the scripture tells us so
[1:23:52] he's saying where is the place of my
[1:23:54] rest and you can say here I am yes Here
[1:23:57] I Am Lord you've been looking for me
[1:23:59] here I am hallelujah hallelujah sir but
[1:24:01] he wants to take you and place you as
[1:24:03] that appropriate Place amen as the place
[1:24:06] of his rest that's why he found you
[1:24:08] that's why he's called you that's why
[1:24:10] he's gathered you because there's a
[1:24:11] place by him and he's determined you
[1:24:13] shall be in that
[1:24:15] place now we read here in Revelations
[1:24:19] let's go to Revelations chapter
[1:24:21] 12 Hallelujah you are the place of his
[1:24:23] rest
[1:24:24] you have been prepared you have been
[1:24:26] prepared to be a place of his
[1:24:29] rest now we're going to Revelations chap
[1:24:32] 12 cuz I said now there's a war
[1:24:35] now there is a war between Satan and and
[1:24:40] God and the war is now who does this
[1:24:43] land this Earth and you're part of this
[1:24:46] Earth who does this whole world system
[1:24:48] belong to this is it's always been a
[1:24:51] great great struggle between him and God
[1:24:53] Satan
[1:24:54] Satan thinks that he he owns it because
[1:24:56] Adam forfeited it but it couldn't go
[1:24:59] into his his hands even though he has a
[1:25:01] bit of control because he can that's why
[1:25:03] there's the typhoons that's why there's
[1:25:04] the earthquakes that's why there's all
[1:25:06] the sickness and the plagues and all
[1:25:07] these things because because he because
[1:25:10] the devil is actually in control of this
[1:25:12] earth right now right that's why it is
[1:25:15] because man let him take control right
[1:25:18] so we just reaping what Adam swed back
[1:25:20] in the garden why does God allow
[1:25:22] suffering because he actually he
[1:25:24] actually has permissively allowed Satan
[1:25:26] to take control of this Earth because
[1:25:28] Adam forfeited godship over this Earth
[1:25:31] but then we know this must come to an
[1:25:33] end this must come to an end you know
[1:25:36] it's so
[1:25:37] late I don't know if you feel a change
[1:25:39] in the season but but the hour is late
[1:25:42] Hallelujah and I say praise God the hour
[1:25:44] is late I want it to be late amen I want
[1:25:46] it to be done yeah how much you think
[1:25:49] God when he says it is done in the in
[1:25:51] the end of the book of Revelation hey
[1:25:52] he's going to be he's going to rejoice
[1:25:54] actually becomes becomes material when
[1:25:56] it's more than just thinking in his mind
[1:25:58] or just scripture on a page but this
[1:26:00] when that day that scripture was
[1:26:02] fulfilled he says it's done and we say
[1:26:04] hallelujah come quickly Lord oh don't
[1:26:07] you want to go to heaven Hallelujah
[1:26:09] don't you want to see our enemy cast
[1:26:10] into the Lake of Fire don't you want to
[1:26:12] see sickness and everything that Wars
[1:26:14] against you done away with
[1:26:17] hallelujah
[1:26:18] amen hey I want to see that day
[1:26:21] hallelujah oh whyn't you be sad that day
[1:26:22] no sir
[1:26:25] hallelujah amen Revelations 12: 7 and
[1:26:29] there was war in heaven Michael and his
[1:26:30] angels fought against the dragon and the
[1:26:33] dragon fought in his angels and
[1:26:34] prevailed not neither was their place
[1:26:36] found anymore in heaven so they're
[1:26:38] changing
[1:26:39] place and the Great Dragon was cast out
[1:26:41] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:26:43] Satan which deceives the whole world he
[1:26:46] was cast out into the Earth and his
[1:26:47] angels were cast out with him and I
[1:26:50] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:26:51] has come salvation and strength and the
[1:26:54] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[1:26:56] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[1:26:58] is cast down which accused them before
[1:27:00] our God day and night and they overcame
[1:27:03] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:27:04] word of their testimony and they love
[1:27:06] not their lives until the death
[1:27:08] therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[1:27:10] dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of
[1:27:12] the earth and of the sea for the devil
[1:27:14] has come down unto you having great
[1:27:16] wrath because he knoweth that he hath
[1:27:18] but a short time there was a time where
[1:27:21] the devil could go up into heaven and
[1:27:22] accuse accuse you
[1:27:24] before the judge cuz he knows God is
[1:27:26] Judge that's why he he went up there in
[1:27:29] the days of job you know cuz he was
[1:27:31] trying to get something he could hold
[1:27:33] against job and he knows our life story
[1:27:36] he's a very good genealogist you know he
[1:27:38] knows the you know the weaknesses of our
[1:27:40] family of our of our Humanity that has
[1:27:43] passed down and he knows our weaknesses
[1:27:46] and he tells God he says those people
[1:27:48] are are worthy to be destroyed hey God
[1:27:51] is a righteous judge he's not a little
[1:27:54] oding granddad but he's a judge and says
[1:27:56] when the Wrath of the Lamb is poured out
[1:27:58] upon the Earth in the Great Tribulation
[1:27:59] it'll be a great wrath it'll be a
[1:28:01] terrible time for the Earth but it'll be
[1:28:03] glorious for the Believers because we'll
[1:28:04] be up in glory then but you see now
[1:28:08] there there has to come a time where
[1:28:10] Satan is not in heaven anymore where he
[1:28:12] actually has no legal right to come up
[1:28:14] and accuse us before God day and night
[1:28:16] and that he is cast down and we
[1:28:19] understand that we're living in that
[1:28:20] time hey great things are great things
[1:28:22] are happening amen in the season that
[1:28:25] we're alive and you know the whole world
[1:28:27] order not just in the scene but has been
[1:28:29] has been totally rearranged yes sir
[1:28:31] where Satan is being dispossessed and
[1:28:33] the Bride of Jesus Christ is coming into
[1:28:35] her possession where brother BR speaks
[1:28:37] about when the lamb took the book and he
[1:28:40] and he loosed the seals he said that
[1:28:42] that book is is is the book of
[1:28:44] redemption it is a titled deed to the
[1:28:46] Earth that Adam forfeited went back into
[1:28:48] the hands of the original owner but he
[1:28:50] says now comes the season where the lamb
[1:28:52] steps forth because because he he paid
[1:28:55] that that piece of paperwork would be
[1:28:57] handed back into man's hands once again
[1:28:59] godship over the Earth that's what it
[1:29:01] means it's godship over the Earth
[1:29:03] because God knew that no man was worthy
[1:29:06] you know when you when John is lifted up
[1:29:08] in Revelations 4 and 5 and the strong
[1:29:10] Angel proclaims who is worthy to take
[1:29:13] the book and John WEP because there's no
[1:29:15] man there found worthy hey there were
[1:29:17] Mighty Prophets You Know Abram was there
[1:29:20] Mighty prophets were there Moses was
[1:29:22] there Elijah was there brother was there
[1:29:24] Paul was there you know mighty men and
[1:29:26] women of God were all there but no man
[1:29:29] was found worthy hey there were Angels
[1:29:31] there they but but God didn't die for
[1:29:33] Angels amen and that's why John Whi
[1:29:36] because he knew if if no one was no man
[1:29:39] no Flesh and Blood like us was found
[1:29:42] worthy to take that book all of creation
[1:29:44] was was lost and the enemy couldn't be
[1:29:47] dethroned but then he saw the he he he
[1:29:49] turned to look he saw the lamb come
[1:29:51] forth he saw Jesus come forth because he
[1:29:53] had had overcome he had prevailed and he
[1:29:56] had been found worthy and he took that
[1:29:58] deed out of the hands of God now it's
[1:30:00] all remember it's all symbolic and so he
[1:30:02] takes the ownership the paperwork to the
[1:30:05] to to this earth he takes it for himself
[1:30:08] am but then he doesn't leave it for
[1:30:10] himself because he did all that for you
[1:30:13] that you would come to his position hey
[1:30:15] he was the son of God he didn't have to
[1:30:16] be redeemed he didn't need to be saved
[1:30:19] or anything he was in his rightful
[1:30:21] position from his birth onwards he just
[1:30:23] grew into that position but then we we
[1:30:26] have to be taken from this world we have
[1:30:28] to be set free from everything and the
[1:30:31] devil is holding you back just just just
[1:30:33] let go amen if the devil's trying to
[1:30:36] hold you back just say I don't serve you
[1:30:37] no longer Hallelujah hey tell it to his
[1:30:41] face I don't serve you anymore
[1:30:43] Hallelujah this habit I don't serve you
[1:30:45] anymore this addiction I don't serve you
[1:30:47] anymore I'm done with you yes hallelujah
[1:30:50] amen amen hey if you confess it God will
[1:30:53] work upon your confession he is the high
[1:30:55] priest of our profession hallelujah
[1:30:58] hallelujah amen so now he takes that
[1:31:00] book and he doesn't what he does is he
[1:31:02] doesn't leave it in his own possession
[1:31:04] but now he passes it down to you by the
[1:31:06] preaching of the word in this hour
[1:31:08] that's why this message is so important
[1:31:10] because it causes you to recognize who
[1:31:12] you are in Christ and what Christ has
[1:31:13] done for you and is actually an
[1:31:15] overcoming power in this word hey Joshua
[1:31:18] heard the preaching of Moses him and
[1:31:20] Caleb and there was an overcoming power
[1:31:22] in that preaching that they say more
[1:31:24] than able to take the land and they took
[1:31:26] what belonged to them how much more the
[1:31:28] Bride of Jesus Christ under the blood of
[1:31:30] the perfect one Hallelujah when we hear
[1:31:32] that word we say it belongs everything
[1:31:34] belongs to me this Earth belongs to me
[1:31:37] amen the devil is defeated he has no
[1:31:39] right to to come into my life any longer
[1:31:42] he's no right to come around my children
[1:31:44] to come around my spouse to to try and
[1:31:47] hold me back in anyway he has no right
[1:31:49] and you have the right by speaking the
[1:31:51] word and faith take God at his word
[1:31:54] speak it across the lips and wait for it
[1:31:57] to become manifested amen hallelujah
[1:32:00] that's what Abraham did he said I
[1:32:01] believe you I believe that and he
[1:32:04] confessed it Sarah we're having the
[1:32:05] promised son and he just rejoiced
[1:32:07] Hallelujah 25 years you're still
[1:32:09] rejoicing Hallelujah and then one day
[1:32:12] one day in God season here we are here's
[1:32:14] the here's Isaac
[1:32:17] hallelujah amen hey we're in that same
[1:32:19] boat friends that's right amen we're
[1:32:21] waiting for the return of the promised
[1:32:22] son for the promised son hey we're
[1:32:25] prepared we've been changed to to meet
[1:32:27] the promised son that's why Abraham and
[1:32:30] Sarah they go down to Egypt Abraham says
[1:32:33] to Sarah tell him you're my sister Here
[1:32:35] Comes Grandma why is he afraid if it's
[1:32:38] old grandma that's still old then the
[1:32:40] king the king who could have taken any
[1:32:42] woman he wanted in that whole land he
[1:32:44] says I want I want this one old grandma
[1:32:47] no teeth bunched over gray here all no
[1:32:49] she was turned back young again to
[1:32:51] receive the promise she had a body chain
[1:32:54] HJ hallelujah amen to receive the
[1:32:57] promised son and we have in us already
[1:32:59] that power that can change this body
[1:33:01] Hallelujah if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:33:03] you have already everything we have need
[1:33:05] of is in you already amen it just takes
[1:33:07] the preaching of the word to say hey
[1:33:09] that is mine and that is mine too and
[1:33:11] it's already in me and I can use it I
[1:33:13] mean I have faith to to push the button
[1:33:15] Hallelujah to activate God and God comes
[1:33:17] upon the scene for you amen we have
[1:33:20] right and so this is why the the world's
[1:33:24] falling apart because Satan is being
[1:33:26] dispossessed and there's a people rising
[1:33:28] up who recognize who they are and Satan
[1:33:31] is being dispossessed and we're actually
[1:33:33] ascending into our rightful position yes
[1:33:35] sir Hallelujah I believe it now let's go
[1:33:38] to uh the book of Ephesians and we'll go
[1:33:39] to Ephesians chapter
[1:33:43] 2
[1:33:46] amen have you see God molding and
[1:33:48] shaping your character to match his
[1:33:50] character you're taking your land amen
[1:33:52] amen you see more more of Christ in you
[1:33:55] in your behavior how you relate to
[1:33:56] people all these things because remember
[1:34:00] you hear the word and the word is meant
[1:34:02] to create Christ's character in you
[1:34:04] that's what Revelation does produces his
[1:34:07] life in you yes that's why Moses he
[1:34:09] received the law by Revelation upon
[1:34:11] Mount Si and he was he became the
[1:34:13] meekest man in all the
[1:34:15] Earth why because it was a revelation to
[1:34:17] him and produced that character before
[1:34:19] that he was a general he was ruled here
[1:34:21] in Egypt he wasn't some little Meek guy
[1:34:24] going to ride in his Chariot come on
[1:34:25] boys we're going to kill these
[1:34:26] Ethiopians or whatever they were hey he
[1:34:28] wouldn't have been a meink little fellow
[1:34:29] sitting in the back he have jumped on
[1:34:31] his Chariot gone headlong into the enemy
[1:34:34] amen but then because God revealed
[1:34:36] himself to him and produced this
[1:34:39] meekness in them amen oh I know the
[1:34:43] Bible what character do you have oh I
[1:34:45] believe God what character do you have
[1:34:47] amen amen oh the message all makes sense
[1:34:50] to me what character do you have what
[1:34:52] does it produ
[1:34:54] amen cuz if it's just window dressing
[1:34:57] get rid of the window dressing get the
[1:34:59] life amen hey that's why the scribes and
[1:35:02] Pharisees they learned the same law
[1:35:04] arrogant people look at me look at my
[1:35:06] coat look how clean I am I do all this
[1:35:08] and I look at me and this is what it
[1:35:10] means and all this stuff brother Bram
[1:35:11] said this he did this and look at the
[1:35:14] character amen were they Meek were they
[1:35:17] Lonely No look what it did to Paul look
[1:35:21] at the character he had look at the he
[1:35:24] lived right Timothy when you come bring
[1:35:27] my coat it's
[1:35:29] cold
[1:35:30] amen I come to you in great weakness and
[1:35:33] great trembling right Le you trust in
[1:35:35] man's Wisdom right why is that because
[1:35:38] it was Christ's character in the man now
[1:35:41] hey before that he said I'm Dr Saul and
[1:35:43] open your Bible and this is what this
[1:35:45] means in this scripture and I'll tell
[1:35:46] you what this means and I'll recite the
[1:35:47] book of Isaiah to you backwards and
[1:35:49] forwards and up and down all these
[1:35:50] things look how great I am in my
[1:35:52] learning but when God came all that was
[1:35:55] done away and he could say a prisoner of
[1:35:58] Jesus Christ Hallelujah he became a
[1:36:01] loved prisoner to Jesus Christ and that
[1:36:03] was reflected in his life yes Hallelujah
[1:36:07] that's why we can say if God is molding
[1:36:08] his character into you you're ascending
[1:36:11] you're taking your Promised Land because
[1:36:13] we've been called to be molded and
[1:36:14] shaped into his image and that's not
[1:36:17] wearing a robe and walking around
[1:36:18] Galilee and doing all these things it's
[1:36:19] his very nature his very life in you
[1:36:22] amen hallelujah hallelujah now let's go
[1:36:25] to Ephesians chapter
[1:36:27] 2
[1:36:33] J I read from verse
[1:36:36] one he saying you hath he quickened so
[1:36:39] he's speaking now these are people who
[1:36:41] who who really know
[1:36:43] God and you had the quickened who are
[1:36:45] dead in trespasses and sins when in
[1:36:47] times past you walked according to the
[1:36:49] course of this world according to the
[1:36:51] prince of the power of the year the
[1:36:52] spirit that now worketh and the children
[1:36:54] of Disobedience so they had a jubilee
[1:36:57] once they were once they were following
[1:36:59] the spirit of this world and they did
[1:37:00] what the world said and they did what
[1:37:02] the this is my culture this is what I
[1:37:05] do yep that's how they used to be many
[1:37:09] of them would have been religious people
[1:37:11] you know worshiped Diana and all these
[1:37:12] different different denominations but
[1:37:14] then God Came Upon their scene he says
[1:37:17] you have the quickens so be made
[1:37:18] alive among whom verse three also ye all
[1:37:23] had our conversation in times past of
[1:37:25] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:37:27] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[1:37:29] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:37:31] even as others but God who is rich in
[1:37:33] Mercy for his great lover and he loved
[1:37:35] us even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:37:38] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:37:40] grace are you saved now notice now and
[1:37:42] he's saying and has raised us up
[1:37:45] together and made us sit together in
[1:37:48] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus see he's
[1:37:50] saying now he has taken you and he's
[1:37:52] placed you in your rightful position
[1:37:54] amen he it's not you know when we say oh
[1:37:58] we're sitting together in Heavenly
[1:37:59] places the believer is always in that
[1:38:01] position the believer is placed in a
[1:38:03] different position then than the
[1:38:05] unbeliever or the make believer because
[1:38:07] the believer now s walks in a realm of
[1:38:10] Faith the believer doesn't walk around
[1:38:12] in the realm of unbelief hey they may
[1:38:14] struggle and wrestle and all these
[1:38:16] things but when when when all that is
[1:38:18] put to one side and Faith takes a hold
[1:38:21] they're walking in a realm of faith
[1:38:24] amen amen every day we are walking in a
[1:38:26] realm of Faith amen how you conduct
[1:38:29] yourself during the day what you wear
[1:38:31] what you do what you don't do the things
[1:38:33] you talk about that is that is walking
[1:38:35] in a realm of Faith yeah amen amen hey
[1:38:38] why do you think different you know
[1:38:40] people talk about their you know I just
[1:38:43] watched a series of this TV show the
[1:38:44] other weekend there's people at work now
[1:38:47] that used to be me but what has happened
[1:38:49] where I say why would I do that yeah
[1:38:51] it's not cuz I'm busy I got three kids
[1:38:53] hey they would do the same thing if they
[1:38:54] had kids no doubt they just P them there
[1:38:56] say watch this you know but what isn't
[1:38:59] me saying why would I do that you
[1:39:02] know hey what has happened I've been
[1:39:06] moved I say I'm trust you can say you've
[1:39:08] been moved from that place into a
[1:39:11] different place you're you're living in
[1:39:12] a whole different realm yes amen amen
[1:39:15] that's right so now so he's saying this
[1:39:17] and this heavenly place in Christ Jesus
[1:39:19] is the position that the believer has in
[1:39:21] Christ yeah yes so this position we we
[1:39:26] have been placed in yeah so we've been
[1:39:28] raised now from Death unto life to sit
[1:39:31] together in Heavenly places so the bride
[1:39:34] you know the believer lives in this
[1:39:36] place all the time that's why brother
[1:39:39] Braham when when he was challenged with
[1:39:40] the maniac there he said I'm going to
[1:39:41] break every you know bone in your body
[1:39:43] and punch him out and all these things
[1:39:44] in front of thousands of people
[1:39:46] beforehand he was a trained boxer he so
[1:39:48] so he could turn that guy on but because
[1:39:51] he was now he was saved he was now
[1:39:53] walking in a different realm and so he
[1:39:56] was instead of fighting it in the
[1:39:58] physical he stayed back and then you
[1:40:00] Lord be still and the Lord will fight
[1:40:02] for you yeah so he stayed still and then
[1:40:06] in God's timing God Came Upon the scene
[1:40:08] and used his mouth and that big demon
[1:40:10] possessed guy fell at his feet amen y
[1:40:13] because he was walking in a different
[1:40:15] realm yes amen and it's the same thing
[1:40:18] hey that position brother Braham is in
[1:40:21] is where the believer is is too yes Y
[1:40:24] and that was done to show what God can
[1:40:26] do in a redeemed person amen amen to
[1:40:29] give an example of what Calvary can do
[1:40:31] in a person do to a person so it's
[1:40:34] giving us showing us now that we can
[1:40:35] walk in the same way hey you know
[1:40:38] brother Ram says I don't need a lot of
[1:40:39] faith cuz God chose me the vision and I
[1:40:41] just go do
[1:40:43] it it says you actually need more faith
[1:40:45] not to see a vision but just take God at
[1:40:47] his word amen that's right amen amen so
[1:40:52] you know
[1:40:54] he so so many times he waited for a
[1:40:56] vision and he acted upon the vision you
[1:40:59] know but we don't we're we we're not
[1:41:02] called to that hey sure if God in his
[1:41:04] grace wants to give you a vision or
[1:41:05] something he'll do it but a lot of the
[1:41:08] time we just got to take God into his
[1:41:09] word take it in faith and just do it
[1:41:12] amen or oh I feel to go pray for this
[1:41:13] one or speak to this one or do this you
[1:41:15] might never see anything really feel
[1:41:16] anything but s says go he say yes Lord
[1:41:19] here I am and you go do it Amen brother
[1:41:23] so it's walking in a different realm and
[1:41:25] so Satan now is cast down and we have
[1:41:28] been elevated to sit in Heavenly places
[1:41:29] in Christ
[1:41:31] Jesus
[1:41:34] amen now I just want to read I want to
[1:41:36] read this this is a manifestation uh uh
[1:41:38] uh manifested sons of God in 1960 it's
[1:41:41] in the adoption series and Christ
[1:41:43] brought the church up to a place to
[1:41:44] where their position was made to them
[1:41:47] was given to them just the Jordan to
[1:41:49] cross but the holy spirit is the one who
[1:41:52] sets the church at
[1:41:54] order the Joshua of today puts the
[1:41:57] church in its order giving each one
[1:41:58] gifts places position and he is the
[1:42:01] voice of God speaking to the inner man
[1:42:03] that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit
[1:42:06] now do uh do you get that much of it see
[1:42:09] so the Holy Ghost places us in our
[1:42:11] position he he he places us in our place
[1:42:14] of adoption and it's either to be a
[1:42:17] businessman or a housewife or a mom or a
[1:42:21] dad or a or a work
[1:42:23] or a preacher or a song leader or a
[1:42:26] musician all those things hey a mom you
[1:42:30] know I tell you the most powerful thing
[1:42:32] after God I believe is a Godly woman
[1:42:35] amen I honestly believe that the most
[1:42:38] powerful thing upon this Earth after God
[1:42:40] is a Godly woman well how is that
[1:42:43] because brother says if you break
[1:42:45] Womanhood you've got the
[1:42:47] nation yeah he didn't say if you break
[1:42:49] manhood now men have to be men and Lead
[1:42:51] their homes absolutely but he didn't say
[1:42:53] if you break manhood he says if you
[1:42:54] break Womanhood if you break mother if
[1:42:57] you break mother you've broken the
[1:42:58] nation that's right amen so many times
[1:43:02] we think of being placed and adopted as
[1:43:04] some great big lofty thing you know go
[1:43:06] be a missionary here or go do this here
[1:43:08] or you know but no he says he says to be
[1:43:11] adopted as a housewife to be adopted as
[1:43:13] a so so that's your placing that God has
[1:43:16] placed you this is I've actually come to
[1:43:18] my
[1:43:19] adoption you know Paul says in I think
[1:43:22] in Ephesians 1 he says that he is having
[1:43:24] predestinated us into the adoption of
[1:43:26] children by Christ Jesus to himself
[1:43:29] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:43:31] will so actually he's saying he's
[1:43:33] actually predestinated us to the placing
[1:43:35] in the
[1:43:36] kingdom and that's the highest calling
[1:43:40] that's the highest thing is for people
[1:43:42] to be placed in their inheritance
[1:43:43] rightfully you're following me yep so so
[1:43:48] a m that's actually being placed I'm
[1:43:50] called you say that's not a GL ous job
[1:43:53] I'm called God has ordained me he's
[1:43:56] adopted me placed me to be a m hey in
[1:43:59] God's eyes that's a mighty thing that's
[1:44:01] as mighty as King David taking the
[1:44:03] throne that's as mighty as Paul the
[1:44:06] Apostle Paul being placed as an
[1:44:08] apostle amen hey just say Amen if you're
[1:44:11] not really too sure about it it's true
[1:44:13] amen it's exactly true hey that's why
[1:44:16] that's why Timothy because Timothy said
[1:44:18] I see the gift that was in Lois you know
[1:44:20] Unice and and then your mom is in you
[1:44:23] why is that because a Godly M and a
[1:44:25] Godly grandma was an example and they in
[1:44:28] their position and they lived according
[1:44:30] to what God laid down for them to do and
[1:44:32] that affected Timothy's life so someone
[1:44:35] being placed in their adoption because
[1:44:36] they were sitting in Heavenly places
[1:44:39] what are you doing looking after the
[1:44:41] kids whatever I'm sitting in Heavenly
[1:44:43] places in Christ Jesus I'm adopted I've
[1:44:46] been placed what are you doing going to
[1:44:48] your job whatever I've been adopted this
[1:44:50] is what I'm called to be this is this is
[1:44:53] my inheritance that God has placed me to
[1:44:55] and if you've been placed and I trust
[1:44:57] you you know maybe you look at your life
[1:44:59] a bit different you say this is what I
[1:45:01] meant to be why do you have that feeling
[1:45:03] CU that's actually God saying this is
[1:45:05] what you're meant to be and in my eyes
[1:45:07] it's a mighty thing and if someone
[1:45:09] stands in their place God will back them
[1:45:11] up why didn't David have to deal with
[1:45:14] abson why not because King David he knew
[1:45:19] he was ordained to be king and he he
[1:45:21] took the full responsibility of being
[1:45:23] King he didn't leave the decision to
[1:45:25] someone else like Ahab did but he took
[1:45:27] full respons saying this is the kingship
[1:45:29] it's me you know and and he possessed
[1:45:31] that office that he was placed in or his
[1:45:33] adoption he he possessed it fully I'm
[1:45:35] King and then absolon raised up now I
[1:45:39] think partly it was the weakness of
[1:45:41] David's relationship with him that's why
[1:45:42] abson raised up but because David was
[1:45:45] standing as king God took care of abson
[1:45:49] that's right
[1:45:50] amen but it was also why did raised up
[1:45:53] like that well David I don't think had a
[1:45:55] very good relationship with his son and
[1:45:57] you can see that because what happened
[1:45:59] with when when when uh Samuel called
[1:46:02] Jesse saying bring your bring your sons
[1:46:04] we're going to have a feast now why
[1:46:06] wasn't David
[1:46:08] called why wasn't David called why
[1:46:10] wasn't David even brought into the
[1:46:12] equation or maybe Jesse didn't even have
[1:46:14] a good relationship with him so you got
[1:46:16] to bring it down to be bones you know
[1:46:19] why wasn't he called well because Jesse
[1:46:22] you know oh it's just David he's just
[1:46:24] doing his thing he's not really that
[1:46:25] important he's just looking after the
[1:46:27] Sheep you know and possibly that that
[1:46:32] poor relationship came down to the Next
[1:46:34] Generation with with David and absum and
[1:46:37] that's why these things happen but even
[1:46:41] with his failings like that because he
[1:46:42] possessed that office he knew he was
[1:46:44] adopted to be king placed as king
[1:46:46] whenever the enemy raised up against
[1:46:48] them that thing was taken care of yes
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:57] now what was I going to finish on I
[1:47:00] think I'll just
[1:47:01] close but we see
[1:47:05] here we have been called to a
[1:47:09] place Jesus says in John 14 he says I go
[1:47:12] to prepare a place for you I'll come
[1:47:14] again and receive you unto myself that
[1:47:16] where I am there ye may be also and
[1:47:19] whether I go you know and the way you
[1:47:21] know and when that place is heaven we
[1:47:24] know it's our body that's already
[1:47:25] waiting for us our our Eternal Body but
[1:47:27] that place that place has been prepared
[1:47:30] just like Moses standing there on the
[1:47:32] Rock he wanted to see he wanted to see
[1:47:34] God's glory and that place was prepared
[1:47:36] for Moses no one else could do the job
[1:47:38] it's the same thing with you if you're
[1:47:40] the Bride of Jesus Christ no one can
[1:47:43] take your place amen amen no one can
[1:47:46] take your
[1:47:47] place God knows hey we have to have
[1:47:50] Security in whom we have believed
[1:47:52] doesn't mean we get lazy or loose you
[1:47:54] know but hey God Paul said I want to
[1:47:57] apprehend that which has apprehended me
[1:48:00] that's what he said and it's the same
[1:48:01] way as Moses saying Show Me Your Glory I
[1:48:03] really want to see you as you are he
[1:48:06] wanted to really lay hold of this thing
[1:48:08] this life that had got on hold of him
[1:48:10] even though he said Moses do I mean God
[1:48:11] do many great things he wanted to see
[1:48:14] his glory and I trust that that is the
[1:48:17] same with you you've been play there's a
[1:48:19] place next to him he's saying there's a
[1:48:21] place by me and he wants you to go stand
[1:48:24] in that place that condition yes amen
[1:48:28] and he wants you to go there what is
[1:48:31] well how do I get there just lay it all
[1:48:33] down lay it all down say Lord take my
[1:48:36] life rearrange it how you want me to be
[1:48:39] amen that's hey death to self You Must
[1:48:42] Die the Rich Young Ruler wasn't willing
[1:48:44] to die to his riches so he ended up in
[1:48:47] his place which was hell he looked up in
[1:48:49] Flames Lazarus the bigger went to his
[1:48:52] Place went to heaven Judas went to his
[1:48:56] place which was
[1:48:58] hell amen the other Thief I mean I mean
[1:49:02] you know one Thief also went there as
[1:49:03] well the other Thief saw the lamb saw
[1:49:07] Christ and that was his season that was
[1:49:09] his his uh his prepared
[1:49:13] moment and he went to his
[1:49:15] place amen cuz God wanted him there and
[1:49:19] he got there you have to be willing
[1:49:23] there's a place are you willing to stand
[1:49:25] in that place amen that's the question
[1:49:29] see it's not it's not if God is able as
[1:49:32] do you believe it because God has proved
[1:49:35] himself down through the centuries amen
[1:49:37] so much in our generation amen we could
