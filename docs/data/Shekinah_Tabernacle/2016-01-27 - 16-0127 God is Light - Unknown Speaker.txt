TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good evening god bless you all this evening this place is teeming with life all these little bodies and people being placed here and there look at these two little people looking through the windows they remember this there's a verse in the bible that says we're now oksana the crib is clean but much increases by the strength of the ox in other words if there's things happening then there's going to be things messy and happening and like that but you know when like so if there's a lot of activity a lot of action then there's something going on so we just praise the lord that there is um that he's given us increase and that is life you know god's a god of increase he's a god of life and and i think heaven is going to be a very exciting place i think it's going to be teeming with life it's not going to be dull and boring it's going to be it's going to be activity on and it's going to be vibrant and joyful and things happening so we just have a little portion of that here we'll just um

amen thank you musicians amen hallelujah amen well it's good to see everyone out tonight amen brother stephen brother tazewell god bless you so nice to have you here amen amen praise the lord if you had your bibles handy we'll just go to uh first john i just want to read the first i guess we could just read the whole chapter there's no harm there's only 10 verses and uh amen praise the lord amen let's just read this here that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and be a witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us and we don't put that in just john that's our testimony that which we have seen and decl heard declare we unto you that that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with the son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full amen this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say then we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us amen lord bless his word you may be seated tonight i'd like to uh i'd like to if i could take a bit of a subject i want to talk about god as light and in him there's no darkness at all we have a incredible day that we're alive and you know it's incredible that we would be at the end of all things and and being here you know many people would love to go back to jesus day and you know and it would be wonderful to be alive then it would have been wonderful to see him break the bread and multiply the fish and you know being in the boat with the disciples and see him hang on calvary and see him go to the tomb and you know all these it would have been incredible to be there but today is actually a greater day than that because because light you know the word was manifested in that day and we understand that whenever the word is made manifest it is light and and so you know the word was manifested in that day and and and that was all done that he would purchase our salvation on calvary but in order to redeem something you must first pay for it then you must claim it you know because what's good of of paying for something if you don't actually take it into your position that it belongs to you and so we are in that second part of his great plan where he is now laying claim of everything that belongs to him and so we are in the claiming time where he actually puts a hand upon you and i and he says this one belongs to me satan they don't belong to you they never have belonged to you they belong to me and it takes the light of god's word to come across your path for you to realize you're not this is not your home this is your your parents you know your earthly parents yo you knew you came out of them but they're not your real parent god just allowed them to birth you into this earth that one day he would come across your path and so the word has already been sent always been sent upon the earth to gather a people you know you see there when moses moses met god is a pillar of fires in the burning bush there was a light that shone and he saw that light and he said i have heard the cries of my people and i have come down to deliver them so there's a purpose was i'm going to gather them to myself and so that's always the purpose where god sends his word is to gather his elected ones and it's always the purpose is not only to gather them but it's to remove all the works of satan from all of them it's to remove their first nature amen this this this nature this sin nature we were born with you know that's why you must be born again it's not because you know we don't need salvation because we just did bad things it's because we're all born with a sin nature and that nature has to die and that and the power that was released to kill that nature was released on calvary amen to that nature of unbelief that would be led by the world in all its darkness amen light shone that that nature would be killed hallelujah and we have the power you know we're not looking we're looking for the change in the body you know brother brown said he's not looking for a great revival he's looking for the coming of the lord this is the end of his ministry he said that the son you know the seven thunders are what needed to awaken the bride and he says they've already come amen so we are not looking you say i need more of god i need more of god all you need is present amen the word that he has released everything we need is in that message amen we're not looking for god to open his word more sure you know there's things he reveals the word to us but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the mysteries of god should be finished and that seventh angel was brother branham's ministry amen so there's no eighth angel there's no ninth angel or some committee of ministers anywhere but all the mysteries are being finished jesus christ has revealed himself in his fullness amen so everything we have need of is available i mean everything we have need of we don't we're not waiting for some great big thing to come all we're looking for is a change in the bodies and what we need to change the bodies god has revealed amen god has released it to us that we can take a body change hallelujah so light you know you see let's go to genesis chapter one amen i just want to read a couple of verses from genesis chapter one let's read down to verse three in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth period and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light amen so the first time it's recorded that god speaks he says let there be light and we understand brother brown tells us if he you know you know if he said let there be light and a fog or something came then it wasn't god speaking when god speaks it happens it doesn't you know it may linger for a season but whenever the season he speaks his word and then when he knows when it's going to be manifest it's it's manifested and so brother brown he takes this if you take genesis chapter one when when god says let there be light that actually means let the light appear so what happens now is in genesis 1 it's actually taken from the view of standing upon the earth and then there's the so there's already light but darkness covers the earth and waters cover the whole thing so so the earth is in darkness and and and the water covers it but in in the earth is seed and there is seed that must come forth amen but there's darkness there's you know that you know there's water covering the life and so god speaks and it begins to be a separation of light from darkness then the land comes forth and then those seeds come forth amen so there has to be a removing of darkness in order for the life to come amen there has to be a removing of remember in him there's no darkness at all but when when you were born you're in darkness doesn't matter if you're raised it doesn't matter if you can trace your lineage back to the upper room wherever it was you're born in darkness but in him there is no darkness so there comes a time where light comes your way hallelujah and he begins to separate amen light from darkness because he sees he sees something in you that even you didn't know you possessed you didn't know what was in you i mean that one day one day the light of the word came over your path and maybe you'd been in all kinds of other churches or other religions but one day this word came your way and then you begin to realize this fits me just right and it was what i was looking for even though i maybe didn't know what i was looking for but something resonated in me yes yes lord hallelujah and then a new life begin to come forth but there's a separation of light from darkness remember in him is no darkness at all and we understand whenever there's light shadows darkness has to flee i mean you can't have light and darkness in the same place hallelujah and it's the light that pushes the darkness it's not the other way around i mean because there's power and light i mean there's pat there's no power and darkness it's a void a mess is the dark you know you know there's no in it your light has energy but darkness has no energy amen so there came a time where god spoke he said let there be and he is actually calling you forth amen he was calling but there was all this darkness that had to be separated amen remember it's god that does the separating amen remember if there's a life in here if there's a life in here it'll come forth in the right atmosphere amen under the right conditions every plan will grow amen and i'm persuaded friends we're not tears we're wheat amen i'm persuaded i'm looking at a bunch of wheat i'm not looking at tears amen so there's light light is to bring forth what it's meant to bring forth and so god now he begins the process and we're not going to read the whole chapter i was going to read those scriptures there but it was to bring forth he says you know he says that they you know it separates everything and then the light finally shines upon the soil and then the life comes forth hallelujah so the light is to do that and the light that those seeds needed was there they didn't need another one they needed that light and then brother brown he oh he speaks the sermon it is the rising of the sun who's heard it is the rising of the sun you know he preaches many easter i think about seven odd easter messages maybe more but when a prophet takes actually a sermon title it's not really i'm just gonna you know he doesn't just scramble something together and think now what can i preach he's declaring something i mean he's declaring a specific thing is happening because remember the word of the lord always comes to the prophet so in god's great timing amen if god is going to declare something he'll tell the prophet and the prophet tells the people amen and then he says now it is the rising of the s o win the sun and he says he says at easter time it was not just one sun rising it was a dual sun rising i mean to the natural sun arose and then god's sun arose the eternal real sunlight arose i mean and it was a it was a dual sun rising so now what was happening now is the as the sun that was rose brought forth the botany life upon the earth but then our supernatural sun was rising i mean to bring forth a supernatural life i mean to shine a shine upon a supernatural people amen that you know many of them you know you know they struggled and they had all different kinds of things like you're like peter he had his struggles but in him was a seed and that seed must come forth god says let every seed bring forth after its kind amen and it's a law that god has placed it must bring forth hallelujah so they were they were there you know and they had sure they had a lot of darkness over them but they didn't change the seed amen that was in them yeah yeah you're following me it's irrelevant what mukpal we came out of it's irrelevant what what pit we're hewed out of that has nothing to do with what is what is in you i mean that is nothing to do it doesn't even come into god's equation amen if he sees a son or daughter of god it doesn't matter what he has to bring them out of he's going to bring them out and it doesn't wear him it doesn't you know it doesn't burden them amen to lift us up where we need to be it doesn't you when god saves someone his power is unlimited and it doesn't you know it doesn't diminish his power one bit i mean to deliver us from whatever we need deliverance from or even to keep us in this world remember we're kept by the power of the holy ghost amen his keeping power keeps us every day if we if we had to keep ourselves friends we'd be lost his loss could be i mean it's his it's his holy ghost in you driving you navigating your life every day amen he's our guide hallelujah but it doesn't it doesn't burden him to guide his children it doesn't weary him to to guide you to where you need to be you take the woman at the well you are sinking you think of the great you know all the people that that man thinks god should have called god bypassed every one of them amen he didn't even he didn't even bring the high priest into account he didn't even bring the priesthood into account he bypassed them all and found a bunch of illiterate fishermen and then he found he found a woman that was you know you know and you know an outcast in her village the woman at the well and she had a revelation that the rest didn't have and people would look at her and say there's no way she's going to be a believer remember jesus when he was calling his disciples he was finding a place that he was going to dwell in he was looking for the place of his rest amen because god doesn't build in a temple made with hands but he dwells in the human heart so he was actually finding the tabernacle that god you know you know that he was going to dwell in and no doubt when they first built that first tabernacle moses you know and the people were inspired to build the tabernacle a certain way they would have done it very reverently and they've done it very respectfully and they would have prayed probably quite a bit before they begin to build it and everything and so man would have thought surely uh uh prepared people the scribes and pharisees that are holy the now amen surely they would be the ones that god would dwell in but god doesn't look at what we think amen he takes the outcasts of life he takes the people that you know people that people think there's no way they're going to be them amen and god says they're the apple of my eye i'm going to make them in my image they'll be like me that's the ones that god always picks i mean all the way down through history it's been those ones hallelujah because man doesn't man looks at the darkness but god just sees what's in us i mean god just looks at the light hallelujah now this word if you're still in first john let's go back to it this word walk in verse if we say we have fellowship with him no but if we walk in the light as he is in the light this word in the greek it means to tread around walk at large especially as proof of ability to live to follow to be occupied with to walk it means so it's talking more than just a casual stroll it means to be occupied with and also as a proof of ability remember it's not your ability yeah it's not look at me i know the message look how much of a christian i am if you're victorious it's his victory you are his victory you must remember that if you're if you yeah it doesn't matter if you've had a terrible year or a wonderful year if you've got faith amen if you can stand and say it doesn't matter what happens in life i'm going to walk with you lord that's victory amen that is absolute victory you see you know you read the faith chapter and we think the great heroes of faith and they were destitute they lived in caves wrapped in sheep skins afflicted tormented that is a that is paul was saying these are the heroes of faith amen and we think being a christian's on the housetop all the time and everything's lovely and everything's well no it's when everything when the chips are down that's when god is proving what's in you amen if you can keep the course i mean not in your own sink but say lord just take me through this day how are you doing i'm just getting through another day halloween everything maybe see him against you but you say i'm gonna walk with you i mean i've been occupied hallelujah i'm occupied with walking with god hallelujah so it's a proof of ability not when things are good but when things are bad you take elite athletes or whoever it is you know it's it's when the chips at where when everything's either success or disaster and it falls just onto a knife edge that's really proves if if they really have what they need you take military you take ethic you know athletic people academic people it's when the chips are down that's really proofs can they can they hold on can they do what they've been called to do i'll tell you what friends the bride of jesus christ has what she needs i mean you have what you need you got to understand you have what you need aiming to get through every situation every trial every unbelief i mean every question i mean anything that tries to bombard you you have what you need i mean just to plow through the thing hallelujah it says count it all joy amen when you're tried and you have tribulation all these different things you say well i don't think i don't think christianity is that way says in the scripture that a man's days are few and full of trouble amen he says count it all joy when these things happen because to walk in light you can't let a shadow come across remember light shows you where you're going you know it's just like yeah i was thinking about this if you get up in the middle of the night and all the lights are off and you think now i've got to go and get a drink of water in the kitchen you can kind of remember where you're going but you're not too sure you gotta you gotta rely on your memory to say it's just so many steps here and this is where the cups are but if you forget there's a bunch of toys in the way you know you're gonna trip and fall on all these things you know so you think it's there but you're not sure but when the light's on then you can see clearly this is my path and and you know the obstacles you need to avoid amen but then when if a shadow comes or the bulbs all blow then you're not too sure again now when the devil brings a question that's a shadow coming across your path because if you look when when the serpent came to eve he said ye has god said they were given some light to walk in don't partake of this fruit that was the light they had to walk in and then satan came along and the serpent and he just tries to put a shadow over that light yay has god said he put a question there and then she began to wrestle with that question and then you know the end of the story they fell amen so don't let don't let the devil come with a question amen because be careful it's darkness coming he's trying to put a shadow over your walk amen and you only stumble in shadows no one stumbles hey if you've got your eyes you can see it's you never stumble in this place walking around but if you turn the lights off when it's dark and you try and you'll probably kick a chair or do you know because why because there's shadow amen are you following me amen don't let him put a question because he always come and he'll put a question is this really the truth do you really think what you have you know do you really think you're a christian do you really think god loves you amen what's that a shadow coming in in god is no darkness at all he's not the author of confusion the scripture tells us but he's the author of peace amen so you've got to think about now well where is this coming from remember waste think something enters into here you're going to think where did that come from did it come from god or is it from satan that's right that's it you got to think about it why am i getting all stirred up and all this you got to think you know where did this come from in him is no darkness at all so as i was saying before there was a dual sun rising there on the day you know when you know when jesus arose but then we must understand we must not put these things just back in history because brother abraham says there's been a resurrection in this day he says what a resurrection that was that day when he came out of the tomb he says what a resurrection this is amen where a people came out of death and unbelief and darkness hallelujah hey we were in tombs i mean you were born in a tomb whether you're like or not you're born in a tomb and you're raised in a tumor but but then god rolled the stone away harlow you're going to recognize god rolled the stone away and you came forth and you recognized i wasn't meant to be in that place amen that that wasn't that wasn't the place i was meant to be hallelujah and he says what a resurrection this is he says what's that resurrection of people they may have been resurrected from death unto life hallelujah you've already been resurrected amen you've got to be spiritually resurrected before this body has changed oh look many of us are looking for the change in the body i say you have to be spiritually resurrected first and if you are spiritually resurrected this body is going to be changed amen it's all part of the same process you must you must be born again i mean you must be resurrected from death to life where it's not your prayer story or the preacher's story of brother braham's story but that same god comes and lives in you the same god does the same things because he says that which from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life amen we've handled the word of life amen amen that life that was manifested came out of the bosom of the father has now come into the believer hallelujah we have handle of the word of life amen these same things have happened to us for that life was manifested and we have seen it amen and you can go if you want to put it back in the 1965 that's fine but you can go and then early 50s you watch the dead call to the deep he's standing there prophets in front of thousands i know you've all seen it if you haven't seen it go watch it again i mean if you haven't seen it you know you know recently he says i'm waiting on him i can't i'm just your brother i'm waiting for him to come and he says now he's here i think every spirit under my control amen and then he and then exactly what jesus the same jesus 2000 years ago comes and uses a prophet to reveal himself that life that was in the bosom of the father was declared again in this generation hallelujah and so you can actually behold it and you can hear it amen on tape and he says now whatever he says whatever he says you listen to amen why because god took us bypassed his mind and used his mouth and his vocal cords and spoke things that only those people knew amen that was the life that was eternal life being on display but you can't put it back 50 years ago because that same god amen that's why i say we're not looking we don't need you know he is present amen our god our god is present amen he says i'll never leave him or forsake see thee i need god to move his presence amen if he could recognize you know we have experienced the awakening of the bride amen harley we have expansive you know we know who we are hallelujah we're not in a dead slump i'm talking individually i mean we're not in some dead so i'm talking about the bride around the world i mean the bride is not in a dead slump i remember we know in whom we have believed amen because the light in them is no darkness at all that light has been manifested amen hallelujah amen we have seen we have handled amen the word of life hallelujah the same god that was there is present i mean that same one we don't have to pray him down he's he's there he says i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's what he said i don't feel a whole bunch it's not what you feel it's what you believe amen and he's the high priest of our profession that means if you believe it you confess it how long do i need to confess it or confess it until it becomes reality that's what don't con never confess speak bad things never confess negative things i mean confess the word of god doesn't matter what situation you're in hey the three hebrew children shadrach meshach and abednego they're about to be thrown into the furnace he says oh oh king i'm not gonna we won't bow how be it you know he made they said this is not word for it but but but they said he may deliver us he may not deliver us but we're not going to bow to you amen they didn't begin to quake and fear they just confessed that that god will deliver them he'll deliver if he doesn't we're going to die in faith amen they confess the right thing hallelujah and we know the story of hattie wright you know hattie wright said the right thing that's nothing but the truth brother brandon speaking of the squirrels being created friends that power is here the third pool is here amen it is present hallelujah what activated the third pool the first time was used on a human being she confessed what she believed amen the prophet may be dead but that same god is here amen that same god is here hallelujah he's not gone off the scene he's present and he says now when this is does not verbatim but he says basically when the squeeze comes on that power will become fully manifested now i don't know if you realize but we live in a squeeze do you not feel the pressure of the age i mean you know i feel the pressure of day-to-day life feel the pressure when you go to the mall and go on to the world and you know this there's a pressure there hey man that is the squeeze and there's also he says he says it was a liter it was a physical squeeze put the jews into the concentration camps but that same spirit has been released on the bride and it'll be an ecumenical squeeze and the pope goes to everyone we're brothers we all believe in the same god hallelujah you know i read today the head of the you win you know how there's all the stabbings in in israel the you know the palestinians are trying to stab jews and all those kind of things you heard about in the news yeah they just yo 13 year old palestinian girl got shot trying to stab some settlers and stuff but it's been more than just her many people he said the reason they're doing that is because they've been there's not as you know not exactly his words but you go find it he says basically it's they are doing that as a result of being hemmed in by the israelis it's the israelis fault that they're doing this here's a man of the greatest organization in the earth who's meant to be neutral and bring people together he's saying it's their fault the israelis fault what's happening the pressure is being raccooned up against the jewish people that's right amen remember they are we are spiritual israel amen amen you want to see god's time peace you look at the jews they're being squished was a uh that was it benjamin uh netanyahu said that the u.n is lost it's full and you know it's no longer a neutral voice in the world because of what he said that is physical israel and here you are spiritual as well amen oh i'm waiting for a squeeze to come we've been squeezed you're born in a squeeze and it's slowly going like this remember the jews didn't wake up one day in their homes and the next day in auschwitz they didn't just wake up the next day now i'm gonna try there's a squeeze down where the stars right on their shop windows getting beaten up and all these things you know slowly getting put into the ghettos then in the co you know then in the concentration camp the squeeze friends we we we're not looking for me this is just me now all them fellowshippers brothers uh johnny demoth would say the squeeze is here amen the squeezers here they're all uniting with rome what are we doing now we're the rebels amen we're the non-conformist amen what's happening squeeze oh these people are different why won't they conform to society why they raise their children are they are they holding back you know they're isolating their children making them funny are we no raising them according to the word of the lord amen and love and so a squeeze is here amen but if a squeeze is here that means god is here amen because he doesn't just let he the devil has nothing over our god i'm waiting for the third pill to be manifested we're in a squeeze as i said what activated the third pull had he writes it there's nothing but the truth brother branham amen i've heard that for years now's the season amen oh when the when the when the third pool is here then oh you know then we'll really walk in victory it's here amen it's present power of the spoken word where is that power in you amen and the bride that powers on the bride amen well that's never really been done before it was done once or five times rather than the prophet amen well he is a prophet the same life that was in him is now in a many member bride amen you know the feast in leviticus they cut down the mature part of the corn and they give it to the priest he lifts it up he weighs it before the lord amen and they thank they thank god that the rest of the field will be like this wheat amen and brother says that same life has been waved now in the end time amen light remember light amen it's been it's been waved his word has been waved on display in his life amen amen and he says now this is being displayed and god is saying the rest of them in the field are going to be like this hallelujah the same life that is manifested here that i'm waving you saw it you saw it there in jesus life he was cut down the first one was cut down and waved before god amen as a memorial and then that same life went into the 120 in the upper room and they did the same things you know you're this peter and was it peter and john whoever it was going by the gate beautiful there and he's and he's asking for arms he asked for money they say silver and gold have i known but such as i give unto thee in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk that same life that was in him was in them hallelujah amen and when the squeeze came against them amen they came together and prayed and god god crushed down to those powers because remember they were beaten they were dragged before the sanhedrin and they are beaten they said you must not preach in his name anymore as a pressure amen and that pressure was trying to come upon them that they would that they would stop them preaching in the name of jesus christ and then so they were beaten they rejoiced they came together and prayed and god came down and shook the place and they were given boldness they went out and preached amen so god came down because remember the enemy was trying to them up that that that you know that they'd be intimidated amen you're following me they'd be intimidated so so next time i think well we better not we will not stand on the street corner or stay in the temple let's just have bible studies at home or let's just do it quietly that wasn't god's program at the time amen they came together and prayed and god broke that pressure that that that they were trying to put on them amen amen and here we are hallelujah we should be bold we should be rugged and if this world is trying to your walk amen right if they prayed and god broke complexes out of them that the world was trying to put on them the same thing happens now amen when god comes down and you know you feel sometimes your fingers get a little bit burnt amen because people make fun of your your family or whatever they do don't let your fingers stay burned amen say you gotta say lord take this out of me amen amen it doesn't mean you go stand up and shake everyone and you know use no but you know what i mean because sometimes you know we're not here to compromise with the world amen they didn't compromise they just walked with god amen and whenever the enemy came yo came in front of their way they dealt with that enemy amen hallelujah and that same one lives on us amen there's a maturing going on friends amen amen that same life now i'm gonna you know i'm not gonna be too much longer but that same life that was in the prophet is in you amen and many times we forget we forget what god is doing to us individually and sometimes we think well yeah the devil comes along he puts a shadow over it if thou be the bride of christ how can you say you're the bride of christ remember the bride in this last days is the apex of god's new creation amen because down through the old testament remember there was there was a man and a woman in the garden perfect man perfect woman they fell then in the old testament god was rebuilding the man and that man that he rebuilt that masterpiece man was jesus christ amen but then that was only the male part of the masterpiece brother brown speaks about the woman as well and down through the new testament era the woman's being built and now here she is in her fullness but then but then the devil comes along says well if you're really that how could you really be that look at you but we forget god and simplicity amen you know here comes you know the scripture says when the first forerunner of jesus comes that the mountains will click yo yo yo dance like rams and leaves will clap their hands and all the high places made low low places made high and what was the fulfillment brother says here's a fuzzy face man coming out of the wilderness wrapped up in camels camel skin eating wild honey and locust a man standing knee deep in mud in the jordan preaching repentance the kingdom of god is at hand and here's the fulfillment of that scripture because people have in their mind what an incredible thing is going to happen all the land's gonna move all these incredible things fuzzy face man i mean stomps out of the wilderness he was the fulfillment that was god in simplicity amen you got brother bram son has a dream of brother brown at the end of his ministry and and brother brahms in in indian chieftain garb he's got a big indian headdress on he's on this big military white horse amen and that was signifying now i remember the chief supreme authority amen he was the head of the writers you're following me so here was he was he was now the one who had the gospel for the age a dispensation gospels were given to me that's what paul said and brother had the same thing amen so here was the chief authority on the word that god plate remember there's a prophet office there amen and so you think of that dream you think what an incredible you know you know what incredible ministry this must be you know one incredible man and you see branham tabernacle this little building people say it's gonna be turned into a garage few bricks put together i mean they had to drain a pond and build it and all these different things amen and god had god had things preached there he says i'm going to tell you what was in the back part of god's mind hallelujah you don't hear anyone else say those things amen but if you look at it from the outside you call this a church it's just got a flat roof it's brick there's nothing special but god hadn't built that place there i mean god had things recorded there that that theologians were giving their life to try and find out and they couldn't put the pieces together and then you know apparently when he preached christ is a mystery god revealed he had his bible in his concordance and that's what he used to study for that sermon amen and he stands there says now i'm going to tell you what's in the back parts of god's mind hallelujah and what happens now light's coming forth amen amen to make you and mold you and shape you into god's very image that's right hallelujah so sometimes we you know we stumble remember this is god and simplicity jesus comes out of you know here comes the very crater of heavens and earth and flesh he has no place to lay his head i mean you know he has nothing you know foxes have dens and robert you know birds of nest but the son of man has no place to lay his head you know he was poor poorer than the poor all these different things didn't look like any great man the scripture tells us and he was god in flesh amen and here you come along and you may look in the mirror and say i don't know how i can how i can really measure up to this how can i be mrs jesus christ how can i be the word made flesh today and you are amen and yet you are amen because remember if there's something in here and remember the light when you shine light upon a field it doesn't quicken dirt it doesn't quicken rocks amen it quickens the seed that's in the dirt hallelujah i'm just going to read something from from the rising of the sun here he says this he says now as the sun was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which was do it also to life it was not to bring all dirt to life but it was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around the life not all men will receive christ but uh honor but those which god for ordained to life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's the one that he comes to quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh this old sun is so hot that rock say this old sun is so hot but that little seed said that's what i'm looking for and it began to spring forth to life it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to quicken the rock not to quicken the dirt but to quicken the life of the seed amen now the holy spirit comes now of course it wasn't sent why won't it why why won't all people receive it it wasn't sent to them amen but it was sent to you others he said the seed said that's what i'm looking for hallelujah so it may not quicken your neighbor but it's quickened you hallelujah why because there's a seed that the light has been sent to receive hallelujah amen this is this life hey man he's shining if you haven't recognized that he's shining it doesn't matter where you're from he's shining harley and he's drawing you out amen to what you really should be you say well i i don't think it's really shining you know a blind man i probably said this before a blind man he's never seen the sun but he feels the effects of the sun when he goes out under the sun it takes someone who actually can see because the blind man can say what am i feeling and the guy who can see said it's a it's the sun in the sky and then the person that feels the sunrise say oh now i understand what i'm you know the presence that i'm being bathed in hallelujah and you can feel the same thing when you come under the sun rays the s-o-n rays harlow you can feel it in your life the effect amen you may not see the pillar of fire but you can feel its effects on you it says so warm and so lovely hallelujah it changes me hallelujah amen in him is no darkness at all amen darkness has no right to cover the seed of god hallelujah don't bow to darkness amen don't live with it don't put up with it don't don't make peace with it amen make peace with god hallelujah because he said let every seed come forth after its kind amen that's a law so if you have that seed in you amen here's the tree says it's going to come forth hallelujah so don't don't have any works of darkness amen shake it off say lord separate me from the darkness remember he's greater than the darkness amen you don't have to put up with it you don't have to cope with it another day you don't have to bear with it just say lord take it from me in him there's no darkness at all amen because some people the devil says one day you'll be delivered one day you'll get rid of that thing the devil he he he puts what he thinks is he he gets you to believe as a carrot it's it's just over there that's what he tries to do he dangles it in front of you but then you forget what you have what you need you already have it remember faith let's go to romans chapter 10 and i'll just close with this scripture let's go to verse six as i said before speak don't speak negative things amen don't speak what you see because because if you go in the world hey it's all negative amen don't speak what you see speak what he said amen confess what he said amen even if it's abraham confess we're having a child we're having a son sarah we're having a son and they got the you know they got the nursery ready they had everything there 25 years but every day he said yeah you're every month sarah how you feeling i'm feeling older amen praise god it's going to happen hallelujah it's going to happen and many people would say you're nuts you're getting older you're past the time of life amen you can't it's impossible for you to do it and they would say absolutely it's impossible for me to do it i'm not relying on me he said it it's his problem he'll take care of it amen amen but the righteousness which is of faith speakers on this wise say not thy heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith if this is faith speaking the word is naive even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach amen so faith is saying it's not who's going to go up and get it or who's going to call them down it says it's actually neither even in thy mouth amen the what you need to confess remember he's the high priest of our profession he can't move on our behalf if we don't confess if we don't speak to him to do it amen there are many sick people when the woman no you know the sarah phoenician woman she had a woman that was a child that was afflicted with the devil there would have been other mothers that had devil afflicted children in jesus day amen but she went to him thou son of david have mercy on me and then because she wasn't a jew she said lord have mercy on have mercy on me if she didn't speak that he never would have delivered her amen you think about it he would have just continued walking on and she would have been oh my child my child what shall i do amen she had to speak to him amen for her to get healed yes sir the centurion had to go to jesus my servant's sick he says he says you're not even i'm not even worthy that you should come into my house just say the word and he'll be made well that's gentile faith say the word lord amen and and all shall be well if he never if he never would have went there his servant would have still been sick i know oh well that's obvious yeah you got to bring it into today if you don't if you don't confess his word back to him amen if you don't speak his word he can't act on your behalf i mean so what we must never do is just wallow and all this is going bad and this is going bad sure it may all be going bad that confess is worth it lord you're in control you're my healer you're my delivery you're my provider you're my head amen you're my protection yes sir hallelujah it doesn't matter if you feel nothing confess it anyway yes sir amen amen because god's looking for faith and you don't feel faith hallelujah that's what we must do and then he can act upon your behalf amen amen and faith says it's the word is not even in thy mouth what does it say in other words i don't need to get it i have it amen and it doesn't matter what condition you think you're in that's irrelevant amen you don't have to we don't have to do penance there's no penance there's no go on a i was gonna say kentucky but uh uh uh it's not kentucky at all what is it you know the guy on a pilgrimage thinking you have to go seven steps and then maybe you may be worthy to get it no you're not even in the equation faith in you is in the equation and he's given you that faith amen amen so just speak the word in faith confess the word yes sir i mean never speak negative things amen and if you do you say we need to pray about this this is happening we need to pray amen but don't say oh this is going bad it may all be going bad but remember we have what we need amen amen we have more we have it we're not waiting for a i'm waiting for camp we don't need to wait for camp amen oh when i'm when i'm on the streets of glory then i'll be victorious he wants you to be victorious now he's given you what you need to be victorious now well i've been wrestling with this thing on and off and on and off and on and off i mean it has to come into it amen when you get sick and tired of being sick and tired then he'll come upon the scene amen but if you keep nursing the thing you know you know he's not going to take it from you oh lord deliver me from this ipad lord please help me from this ipad but i'm holding it to my bosom how is he going to take it i don't want it then he can come upon the scene amen maybe we'll just leave it there friends we need some musicians we have what we need amen we have it yes i tell you by the authority of god's word you don't need to call him down his presence amen everything we have needed he's he is here brother says my ministry is to say that he is here amen amen and he said he says there's a man standing present that can turn on the light amen if you've heard those sermons and he says there's a man standing present that that will rapture the church i mean he's not talking about himself he's talking about him amen hallelujah one day no the devil tells you one day amen the devil says one day no you say today amen amen satan we're done in the relationship just just cut him loose amen and if he doesn't want to let you go you talk to your real husband and he'll make him cut loose amen amen let's pray gracious
