place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know thomas sayeth unto him lord we know not whether they'll go us and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him philip sat under the lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus said unto him have i been so long with you and yet thou has not known me philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how saith thou then show us the father believe us thou not that i am in the father and the father and me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father and me or ask believe me for the very work's sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than they shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments amen so let's just approach the lord in prayer this morning if you ever

into your hands dear god may you meet every need in divine presence father we want to ask that you take the service under your divine control lord may you anoint speaker and hear or take every spirit in here that's contrary to your word under your control for your glory and may have your way in our lives father in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning uh if i could take a if i could take a um subject i'd like to speak on um the power of seeing you in the scripture amen when you see you when it's not just somebody it's you right so we read a scripture here of john 14 where the lord jesus says you know i have you know i would have he says i go to prepare a place for you you know it's one thing for a person to read jesus making that promise i go and prepare a place for you and it's not personal it could be just for anybody you know it doesn't have the same force when the reality of that strikes your soul right i mean it's very different see if it's just a scripture that's you know uh god hasn't made personal to you it can be a comfort it can be you know it can be a very comforting scripture it can be something that people maybe would like to discuss or debate or examine but that's just and and all those things may be good but when the word is quickened to you when it becomes alive amen it becomes personal and the you becomes you in the scripture it changes your whole life i mean it changes the very the very course of your life i mean when the lord reveals the scripture now we know that we should pray for revelation more than anything right not not head knowledge but revelation that the lord would make the scripture personal that when the lord says i i i go and prepare a place for you something in you says that you as me i mean so when you see the me and the you hallelujah it should change your whole life hallelujah because our god's a personal god he doesn't just throw a promise out there and just you know you know for people to sympathize with and maybe make it a nice funeral text no it's not meant to be that way i mean but the word the spirit of god is here to take his word anchor it in our souls i mean that it would change the very course of our life amen you know god we know the scripture is full of prophecies right when isaiah would stand and he would he would prophesy under the inspiration of the holy ghost you'd say the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel then he'd say a couple of chapters later for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace i mean speaking of when when god would become flesh amen is jesus christ now those those prophecies when they were released for isaiah and the prophet told us that if isaiah really was conscious of what he was saying he wouldn't have said it but god just takes a vessel and bypasses their top two inches and uses vocal cords and a mouth and a tongue and speaks his word upon the earth and you know that that that prophecy prophecies can can circle the globe for maybe hundreds or thousands of years but when god releases a word to the earth he knows exactly who's going to fulfill it he knows when it's going to be fulfilled and he knows how it's going to be fulfilled so no doubt there would have been many devout sincere israelite fathers when they heard isaiah prophesy that or maybe they picked up the scroll and you know they read that and they thought you know my daughter's going to be the fulfillment she's going to be the virgin that's going to be you know you know that's going to conceive but you know so and then no doubt down through the ages it would have become a scripture of great comfort you know maybe when they are in babylon or maybe they're under the oppression of the romans they'd begin to read those scriptures and you know that find consolation in it you know the messiah is going to come amen a virgin's going to conceive i mean the prince of peace the mighty god is going to become flesh among us and it would be a great source of comfort but god never just intended his word just to be a mental comfort i remember god intended his word that it would put on flesh and live i mean so when god ordained that prophecy he knew exactly who the virgin would be amen many i said you know as i said many uh devout israelite men would have said it would have been their daughter but there was one that was going to fulfill it and that was mary herself she didn't realize she was part of the fulfillment when she was born but there came a season in her life where maybe the you know the rabbi one sabbath when it when they went to the synagogue you know maybe he just felt inspired to read the scripture and you know no doubt there would have been thousands of times that thousands of men would have read the same prophecy but when it comes to the season of fulfillment then the anointing comes down upon the word and it comes to pass so you know maybe he felt a little bit inspired though maybe the old rabbi took the scrolls and you know he just found inspired to read isaiah nine and six and you know he he maybe had no idea exactly who was in the in the congregation that morning i mean when it was going to be fulfilled but there was a little woman that was sitting there that she didn't realize she's part of the fulfillment but there she was in a in a predestinated time she was a predestinated woman at a predestinated moment and she was gonna hear a word that had been circling the earth for hundreds of years i mean but finally it was inspired upon a man to speak it amen and then it anchored everyone else heard the same word i mean but it was for her i mean the virgin it became personal god actually told her and her soul that's you i mean it became alive to her and maybe you know after the service you know her and joseph when they went back home or you know spent the evening together or the afternoon they began to talk about what the rabbi spoke about in the church and you know maybe maybe you know mary had a different kind of look in her eyes and maybe they'd begin to talk about how powerful what a powerful moment that was and you know that was kind of different you know the rabbi kind of stood there a little bit different and there's something in his voice that kind of you know is a bit different to how you you know usually isn't and then and then maybe maybe you know the um you know joseph got out isaiah rolled out the scroll and you know because mary said read it again hallelujah and then and then and then you know he you know he began to read it again the atmosphere in the room which you know i'm just dramatizing these things you know you know just to make it because this is what happens when we read the scripture and it's not just just for someone else it's for you personal i mean the atmosphere begins to change you know it's like an electric presence comes the reality of the scripture begins to dawn on our hearts is you know because it's becoming personal right hallelujah then mary would hear i mean joseph read this same scriptures and it was just so alive to her and you know she began to ponder those things because the word had gripped her hallelujah amen because the the you and the prophecy became the me right it became personal amen and brother abraham says here you know and while he was reading he heard a sign he looked sideways and the little lady sweetheart of of his her little face had flashed up her eyes was glistening like the stars on a dark knight said read that again there and he read it again and she must have said oh who will that be what is the prophet speaking of and he said something like this or would have said the prophet was speaking of the messiah which will come and one of our women someday will bear the messiah that scripture seemed to grip the little virgin she just couldn't get away from it amen and and and that's what she was studying about perhaps on this morning where we find she going to the well to get water maybe i'll say it was monday it was wash day she had to go get the wash water early her mother was old and as she was thinking on that scripture unto us the son is born unto us a child is given and his name shall be called the council the prince of peace the mighty god the everlasting father she became so interested in what she was saying i trust the scripture grips you the same kind of way he's become so interested in it amen or thinking until she almost forgot to turn the corner and as she raised her head there was something strange seemed like a light flashed and she turned down towards the city square where the virgin well stands yet today and she must have thought oh the sun flickered on some jew that's left on the side of the hill or maybe it hit a piece of polished metal somewhere or an armor of a roman soldier that perhaps i saw the flicker before my eyes so she goes on dreaming oh it's too bad that the church today doesn't walk in the spirit like that more than we do for that's for that's for it's that kind of a time when god comes to you you know it was on the road to emmaus when cleopas and his friend was speaking and talking and thinking about jesus that he walked out of the bushes by the side of them and talked with them while we are thinking upon him the trouble with the world today we are thinking about everything else but him then we wonder why we don't get blessings it was just a few weeks ago about three weeks ago when i sat down by some sycamore trees as i was telling you and begin to think it was there for the first time that he come and declared the new ministry to me think on him draw an eye unto me i'll draw and i unto you saith the lord think upon him david spoke that he was he'd write his commandments upon the bedpost and meditate on them day and night that's what the church ought to do would uh would keep your would keep your heart tuned in with god day and night for that's when he appears who loves those moments you just mind begins to wander and think about his goodness and how great he is and then the atmosphere changes what's that that's god drawing there hallelujah that's what we want don't we because he's a god of reality and as she went on walking down the street there was yet uh there was no one yet on the street as she was as she walked along the little dirt path for a sidewalk all of a sudden she began to realize there was something around her a real strange feeling oh that's the most wonderful experience i trust that everybody here has experienced them kind of at times if you haven't this would be a good night i'll say good morning to start just start thinking about him and worship him in your heart and all of a sudden you feel the close fellowship of the holy spirit all i mean all and hallelujah and you just can't stand still when it comes and she was thinking sorry for this long reading but and she was thinking not noticing who was around her a little lady perhaps with a pair of sandals on her feet walking this little dusty path just thinking of the lord and of his promises and other of things to come and as she was thinking all of a sudden that feeling got so great around her until she just raised up her head and when she did standing before her was a light and standing by the light was gabriel the angel the archangel of god if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on god and off the things of the world go about your business go to your church go to your washing clothes whatever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night long then god will do something you're drawing close to him you've got the world shut out just you and him are together now this appearing of the angel frightened the little virgin she had been taught that the days of miracles was passed but she had seen something happen the angel told her hail mary hail means to stop for he had a message for her and when the angel comes he's got a message for you and the holy spirit god's angels here tonight i'll say this morning with a message for every believer just keep him on your mind just keep thinking about him how lovely he is how sweet he is of his promises if you're sick get this on your mind he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes i was healed keep your mind centered like that something will happen to you all of a sudden something drew nigh to you and anointing will come on you and out of your chair you'll go draw nigh unto the lord he'll draw nigh unto you amen hallelujah and she looked at this great angel and his name is gabriel and and there are angels of the lord many of them and they come to the earth and bring messages but gabriel when he comes there's something major going to happen he was the one who announced the first coming of christ he'll be the one that allows the second coming of christ and he told mary thou hast found favor with god what a message to bring to her thou has found favor with god and while she was thinking on that scripture then that was the scripture that was confirmed to her now if you're sick think on that scripture if you're lost think on that scripture if you want the holy ghost think on that scripture and the holy spirit will confirm it to you hallelujah it's very important we keep our mind on the lord if we want him to draw near just worship him in your heart love him amen meditate upon him and he will draw near amen and the scripture that you're that the lord leads you to think upon amen he will confirm it to you i mean so mary had heard a virgin shall conceive but then she realized she was the virgin hallelujah so the you became the me in the scripture if i can put it that way i mean so the so the virgin became her in the scripture it became personal to her amen so mary went from hearing of a virgin shallow shall conceive to realizing by revelation that she was the one to fulfill it so it went far beyond a comforting scripture that they would have read and said no that because the oppression of the romans and the hard economic times they were facing you know went far beyond just the comfort of well the messiah's going to come and fix all this and we're going to live in peace in our land again two it was more than that amen but that that the revelation came she realized i'm a part of the fulfillment of that word hallelujah and that's when when the scripture grips our souls god's telling you you're part of the fulfillment of the scripture i mean that's why this message has come to us i mean where the lord said i go to prepare a place for you and and the prophet tells us when it says that there's many in my father's kingdom and many mansions he's saying that that well my father's house has many mansions he says that that's the king james way of speaking things and we know a house in those days was referred to as a kingdom right so my k and then a mansion is not just a building of streets of gold and you know many rooms and different things but those mansions are actually eternal bodies right that we're going to step into i mean so when the lord reveals that to you what's he telling you you're part of the fulfillment amen that where i am he says up in glory amen i will come again that where i am you shall be with me amen hallelujah amen and i'm sure you could agree that would change your whole life amen you you know mary mary had the same trouble she had the same things going on in her life but she realized the messiah's coming and not just coming somewhere but through her she had found favor with god she was actually the ordained womb that the messiah would be born through hallelujah but you see now the lord's looking for our response because mary had to say to the angel in luke 1 38 be it unto me according to thy word so god's looking for a response hallelujah so we should always say amen irrespective of of how we feel about ourselves and how well we think our walk is going and i think how how good we think our day's going our years going our life's going irrespective of all those things you say yeah lord your word is true for me amen amen because remember we are the clay he's the potter but the clay's got to respond to the potter amen amen i've been made in your image amen i've been made in your likeness amen hallelujah amen i'm a partaker of your divine nature amen and then with that amen with that response god begins the mould and shape oh look that's why you should never confess negative about yourself hey you may be in the worst spot of your life but the lord can reach down further than you can look up amen so we've got a we're going to testify the lord's my help he's my deliverer he's my shield my fortress my strength amen he is the shepherd hallelujah if one of the sheep's gone astray he'll go hunting that sheep hallelujah amen amen so now but the thing is so god revealed this to mary but you're gonna realize she didn't have anyone else to share this with there wasn't anyone else that was part of that event it was her and gabriel right there was no one else that received that revelation you know she had no one at first to talk about at worth and the thing is when she began to tell not everyone was rejoicing with her i mean it didn't start a universal praise and worship through israel hallelujah they weren't rejoicing it didn't just trigger a great you know everyone get back to god and throw away the creeds and traditions of man and god's going to fulfill his word and no it didn't start any of that but sometimes you know i mean well that's actually what happens god does something for someone not everyone's going to rejoice but that doesn't change what god has done amen so it couldn't change amen it did not change her testimony and and how and the reality of it to her i trust it's the same way with you doesn't matter what how people respond amen you meet god jesus christ stepped out of history changed your life it doesn't change the reality of it amen even joseph her fiat who who was her fiance when he heard the news he wasn't rejoicing and skipping he was greatly troubled i don't know how that conversation went but i don't think it ended up on a hallelujah high you know no doubt she is rejoicing she is excited i met an angel hello you know the scripture we're reading see it wasn't just an empty and you know an empty experience no she began to show signs of pregnancy there's actually a manifestation of her life that proved the supernatural was real so it wasn't just an empty thing i'm having the messiah nine months later are you sure no she had the messiah but when when when she went when she went and told joseph i doubt very much that he had a big grin on his face and was happy it says he was troubled and and sometimes this is what happens with testimony but god had to get him on board hallelujah god had to get up because he had to be a shield for her right she he had to protect them amen so so he would you know but you know no doubt he began to wrestle in his mind because he would have been marrying mary for her character she's a real lady but then she comes with this news and he's just troubled you know this had never happened before a virgin had never conceived before he couldn't go back into the sacred records and say well this prophet did this or this did this and this happened so yep this is no it never happened before though they were looking for it to happen it had never happened before so there he was trouble in his mind and wondering you know and then he came to a point his his you know the conclusion of his thought pattern was i'm just going to have to put her away privately i'm just going to break this off and maybe you know but but but i'll do it privately because i don't want to cause any more hurt and you know i'm heartbroken and you know because she's saying that if an angel visited her maybe it was a maybe a roman soldier maybe something happened in the family she's trying to cover this all up and you know but i thought she was such an honest woman and what's going on and so the conclusion of his thought process was i'm just going to break it off and then maybe even thought in his mind how he was going to do it it's not easy to raise some subjects right this is this is pretty this would be a weighty conversation this is going to change lives it's not a flippant thing just to say casually you know we're over mary see you later no this is not how it would have worked right he's a just man so but while he was thinking on these things an angel of lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost i mean so now because it became personal to him hallelujah you know if you have a real testimony and it's given to a real believer god will confirm that testimony to that believer amen and this and now they can actually fellowship together because it became real to them hallelujah hallelujah amen brother brown would say in jehovah of miracles oh if the church would be just like that the word settles it if god said so that's all we need to know how's it going to be i can't tell you but if god said so it's going to be that way because god said so oh that's what i want the church to know if if there's anything i want to sink faith in is in what god has said it has to be true i mean to sank into mary's heart it sank into joseph's heart it's because they became the me in the you in the scripture if i can keep putting it that way it wasn't just a out there it was to them hallelujah and i trust that the word has become real to you it's more than ink on paper it's more than it's more than a prophet's message i mean it's more than preaching it's more than just someone else saying it but but it comes alive i mean that you can hear the voice behind the voice and it anchors into your soul and it changes your life i mean every promise of god should be personal not just for someone else not just something to instagram or put on the fridge but it becomes a living reality because when it becomes a living reality your whole life will be changed i mean joseph's life went from well i'm just gonna break this off and you know maybe i have to find someone else to marry and all this his whole life changed from that one dream now i've got to protect mary hallelujah she's my wife but she's carrying emmanuel i'm going to protect the child i've got to raise you know lord help me give me wisdom oh my the messiah's in my house this is not just going to be another family i've got messiah in my house oh they should be the same way with you and i when the word becomes personal i've got messiah in me i've got the lord jesus living in me oh god give me wisdom help me lord amen you know revelation is the most important thing it can never be overemphasized the prophet tells us true revelation of the scripture can never be overemphasized we're living in a day of great storms and and chaos every opinion under the sun is just a twitter away or instagram or whatever place your social media name there it's just that away an email away a text away you know so every opinion under the sun so we need a real stability in this h and i say we need a greater stability than any other age is needed why because this is the age where my my voice can go around the world every country under heaven who's got a internet connection could could could plug into this service right now so it's never been that way before but if the word becomes alive to us because remember only god's word is eternal heavens and earth will pass away my my word will not pass away so if we could just yield ourselves to his word not what's going on in our mind spirits plagueis mind battles whatever more but if we just anchor into his word and let god make it alive to us you know when i met the lord well before i met him i just realized i can meet jesus if he's alive because this this book tells me the term's empty he says i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and i heard a prophet say he's here and then god come down and vindicate what that prophet said and say jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it just anchored into my little heart i can meet jesus so if i can meet him lord come meet me change my heart that i can meet you and he changed my life amen and i met him he changed my life forever hallelujah amen you know so jesus can be met who can testify of that you can actually meet jesus he said i've met him i know amen see with joseph though before he had that dream that's when reasoning can come in because if the scripture is not a revelation then the devil will use reasoning to explain away the fulfillment and that's why he came to the conclusion i'll just put her away privately because reasoning began to kick in this can't be true this can't be happening this way what she said it just seems she's amazing girl that's why i'm marrying her but you know it's just too fantastic it's just two and they begin to reason well what's the conclusion well obviously a virgin can't can't conceive so it must have been another man and she's been with another man so i'm just gonna put it away yeah but it was the devil was using reasoning to explain away the fulfillment and the devil's got a lot of reasoning he's had thousands of years i mean to to to hone down reasoning he's very good at reasoning his reasoning isn't actually it sounds very reasonable that's why a lot of people fall for his lies amen he started reasoning up in heaven that's where sin started when he preached through the angels and and his reasoning that i can make a better kingdom than god amen resonated i'll use a buzz buzzword yo you get emails and and people say this resonated with me okay you're on that frequency you know you know but it resonated with some angels and now they've become devils because they fell from their first estate so he's very good with with reasoning but that's why the scripture says for us to cast down reasoning amen because the word is true we should stick with what the word says but the thing is because it wasn't a revelation to joseph the devil used reasoning to try and explain it away amen and basically try and make him break off the engagement but then god and his sovereign grace stepped on the scene amen and revealed himself hallelujah amen so now brother brown says in the church age book he says the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized revelation what is that when the word becomes personal and alive to you it's not something you work out it's not a nice feeling but it becomes anchored in your soul you know it's true just like healing when the revelation that you're healed anchors in your heart you know you're healed it's not i hope so and i hope it's going to work you know it's been revealed amen just like when the lord reveals to you that he died for you on calvary you're not hoping that your sins are washed away you know because he reveals it it becomes a personal story to you it's not just something that someone says but god reveals i hang between heavens and earth i took your punishment upon myself i took your sin upon myself i mean i became a sinner i took your sins down to hell as a sinner that you don't have to go there but you can go into life eternal hallelujah amen that's why we should pray for those things it becomes real who wants god to be personal right who wasn't who well you should say lord become real to me reveal who you are to me and if you have a sincere heart god will show you himself to you so can it be never overemphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now i'm not talking about just this book of revelation and you i'm talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church do you remember mark 16 where jesus asked the disciples this question who do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say thou art john the baptist some say elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it the roman catholics say that the church is built upon peter now that's really carnal how can god build the church upon a man so unstable that he denied the lord jesus and cursed while doing it god can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it isn't some rock laying there as a god has hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't that what the present protestants say that the church is built upon jesus no it is it was the revelation read it the way it was written flesh and blood has not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and upon this rock the revelation of who jesus christ is i'll build my church and the the church is built on revelation on thus saith the lord amen so we can never overemphasize the importance of revelation amen he would say this he says look at it this way too many read the bible where it says in acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if you want to receive the holy spirit they need to repent to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and then god will be duty bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the holy ghost they never get in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to god for a revelation by his spirit that is the first step get in the spirit amen he says don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do amen that's why we've got to get in the spirit that's why it's so important enjoy the song service enter in hallelujah don't just you know just enter in and just just love them from your heart what happens then you get in the spirit then god can begin to work hallelujah now he says have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't just sit there like wall flowers all dried up sticks they enter right into the feel of things and become part of things but oh how they hate the christians for getting into the spirit of god's word they call us fanatics and holy rollers there is nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go right on and get in the spirit of worship our spirit is clean it's fresh it's real it is sober and serious but not but nonetheless full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it saviors and delights and its pleasures amen both christians in the world are human both have emotions the difference is the christian's heart and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh i mean so when you see people dressed up you know come painted head to toe in black and you know at the all blacks and cheering and shouting and it can be freezing weather amen hey we should be that just that same kind of way amen hey they get excited about about a bit of synthetic rubber that's being chased around the field i mean how much more eternal life amen when we gather we begin to worship and praise god that god's going to take us up into glory i mean that should make us exuberant and happy hallelujah amen amen but the devil said it tells us to shh and we say no you shh amen you got to tell him amen hallelujah amen but we're going to get into the spirit now i'm not saying we don't but i'm just hey there's more power and being in the spirit than we realize where the scripture says that god inhabits the praises of his people i mean you think about when you begin to praise god from your heart now how it's manifested that's that depends on the individual but what's going on in here amen but let it come out hallelujah what do you think when you're really going to praise god from your heart he begins to inhabit that praise hillary and just imagine and it's not just one person that god inhabits that praise now it's the whole church so god inhabits the praise of every believer hallelujah and the bible says the anointing breaks the yoke i mean the anointing breaks the yoke i mean so you see you just imagine now you think about the power of really praise god inhabits that praise his anointing comes down and it can break the yoke of the devil off every life that's why it's so powerful i meant to worship in the spirit amen we should never diminish these things because he said oh lord i want to see yokes broken i want more of you god there's more of me i mean there's things in my life i want dealt with just begin to praise and worship god hallelujah amen now he would say this brother brown would say this in the you know i'm sorry if i'm jumping around a bit but brother bam says in the seventh seal he says now when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of christ don't become so you become so far away from your own thinking amen so he's saying that when this went so so when god comes and the supernatural comes in that's the mind of christ now in this age we live in we need to be stabilized right a big stability or the massive stability that god puts in our life is revelation right if you realize that you're a son or daughter of god that gives you a stability i mean you can swim against the tide you don't have to go with the crowd i mean you don't have to do what everyone else is doing conform to social norms no you don't have to do that because your identity is not based on society it's not based on what's on the world wide web i mean but your identity's in the word i mean it gives a real stability right but the thing is now if we want that stability to manifest then we need the mind of christ hallelujah and so when the holy ghost comes down the supernatural in prayer it'll give us the mind of christ right because we can have our mind made up just like just like um joseph was going to put mary away privately that was his mind operating his reasoning but then the supernatural came down into his dream and that what the angel said was the mind of christ don't take don't fear to take into the mirror thy wife for that which is a conceivables of the holy ghost why because the word being manifested in that day amen so the mind of christ was coming down to him in that dream in the supernatural it's so important that we stay in a in a in a spiritual atmosphere and we can because of the blood of jesus christ god doesn't just want to visit us time to time he wants to make his abode hallelujah amen so we need the mind of christ in this age i'm sure we can agree i don't need my own mind i don't need someone else's mind i need the mind of christ amen now jesus prayed often he did so to stand fellowship with the father that was in him then we read there in john 14. he said believe not that i am in the father the father and me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he do it the works so he stay had to stay in fellowship with the god that was in him if he did that do you think and and he was he was the virgin born son of god born without sin he had because remember he had to limit himself like a man to demonstrate this is how human mankind should be but but but if he understand if he was in prayer to stay in fellowship to be led what about sinners saved by grace like us now the amount of prayer i'm not talking about time limits here you can be hours or you can be a few moments but god comes down gives the answer changes your whole life you just walk on so it's not about i talk about the quality of prayer not necessarily you know it's man's works to be well i pray two hours every day that can be man's works that can just be quantity what about quality hey if you're quantity go for it pray all you want you know don't but but but just don't don't humanly do it as a yeah but but pray we should pray i trust this comes out right because i don't want to have your prayer warrior pray on if you want to talk to your lord just tell him all day how great he is just pray on hallelujah you know so every prayer is worth it hallelujah amen but now he says in philippians here rejoice in the lord always again i say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but an eve but by but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto god amen so in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto god you know it's very interesting in the gospels where jesus never taught the apostles how to preach he never taught them how to sing but he taught them how to pray amen so to me it's very important it's vital prayer brother rahm says we can sing too much we can talk too much i could say we could even preach too much but we can never pray too much amen why because prayer should change your mind to match god's mind it's not necessary saying now do this and heal this lord and do this all those things are good that's supplication but should we pray shall we change our mind lord to match your mind i mean so what you want done in my life because god's interested in our lives he is not he's not vague when it comes to our lives he he is interested in the details of our life while we go through what we're facing and he wants to guide us through every challenge right so in everything by prayer and supplication he says finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely what's all the things of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you who wants the god of peace to be with them hallelujah when we think of the armor of god many times we just think of six things we think of now if i have these i nearly missed out one last night but you know so being good about with truth now we know the armor of god to begin with is the baptism of the holy ghost our armor is within us right it's not it's not a rosary prayer we say i'm putting on the helmet of salvation today lord and being good about with truth now i've got the breast plate of no it's in you by the holy ghost so we're fully armed amen this is the best kind of armor man can't touch this armor all of science can't develop this kind of armor that we have in the and these weapons but so many times we think about just being six things good about with truth the breastplate of righteousness feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace the shield of faith the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit but six is not god's number seven is god's number and what the armor of god is capped off with is prayer because he would say here not sure where that's gone but we can go to ephesians 6 and we can read it galatians ephesians chapter six i'm going to try and i feel like time is running away now ephesians 6 12 down to 17 it talks about the armor of god what we wrestle against and put on the hammer of putting on the whole armor of god but then verse 18 if we go to verse 18 after after the arm has been listed it says praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints so that caps off the whole armor because you can say prayer actually puts the armor into action hallelujah you take the shield of faith amen the shield of revelation the fiery darts the enemy come along you know this person said this and they thought this and this happens here and this you know what how do you combat those things take it to the lord in prayer lord they didn't really mean this this is this and you and then and then because brother ram says when you really go into prayer about somebody and you're really in prayer you go up into the presence of god with that person then the lord shows shows you actually why they are that way and then when you come down after that you don't there's no ill feeling there's just love and concern and you want to pray for them more amen so prayer caps off the whole armor that's why we need to stay in prayer now we're living in dangerous and treacherous times but the lord has already equipped us to go through them brother was saying christ is revealed in his own word now when i talk about a ship here it's you right we're actually individual sure there's the gospel ship we got on or the gospel train but we're an individual boat fellowship is two people in a boat us and god and the boat is small enough you've got to be with each other the whole time hallelujah amen so when i'm talking about it when brother man speaks about a ship don't think about just the bride around the world as in this gospel ship don't this is you and god because remember our walk is individual now the stabilizers has been put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the shore see we're nearing the shore what's the show that's eternity that's the rapture just stay stabilized just stay in the word stay with god no matter how you feel what any things else stay right with the word let it stay stable when you see all these great old uh big old clouds around us storms coming and and atomic bombs and everything else that they're talking about but our stabilizer is stay is right straight in the word god said it would be here we'll crest every one of them yeah we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they they can't sink us they can't join us you put us pardon me in the grave uh we'll come out again that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there we'll crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling it the other side no i probably told the story but back in my who's who's 12 here around that age now when i was this age i was i was sailing there in poverty bay in gisborne it'd be like two meter swells and you know there'd be times when you'd be sailing along and the boat would would would um would pitch pole so you'd be and so the bow would dive in and the boat would go this way and you'd go this way and you had to start swimming after your boat because your boat's being pushed by the wind because the bottom of the the hull's actually up like this it's going like this eventually it goes over but you know there's a lot of waves i submarine through right there's a lot of times i went this way the boat went that way i had to swim after my boat but i i'm still alive well that's pretty obvious because you're here no but i'm still alive there's sharks in that bay dangerous things that bay but i had a life jacket on hallelujah and it wasn't me keeping myself buoyant that life jacket was keeping me buoyant doesn't matter what storm and conditions i was sailing through i'm still here amen and that's like the same thing with stabilizers it's the stabilizers will hold you stable in every storm doesn't matter how big the wave is hallelujah you may submarine through it you're going to go through it amen but we've got to have we're going to be stabilized now he's the prophet is telling us that the stabilizers have been put on the ship but we've got to depend upon the stabilizers what if i was out there as a 12 year old boy kilometers from land and i've and i've just capsized and then i'm panicking because you know my life jacket's not going to work i'd be a mess i'm going to die but i had confidence in my stabilizer if i use that analogy a confidence in my life jacket we're gonna have confidence in our stabilizer in this day i mean now these storms that the prophet was speaking about to me they are evil spirits that are running rampant in the end time right this is what these are these are not abstract you know what we've really got to do is we're going to take the word and say lord take it from being abstract idea and bring it down into my everyday life that it can apply because everything applies to us the seals apply to us amen the trumpets applied you know there's practical things in it i mean the face of you know the levitical feasts the seven feasts that applies to us they may seem abstract ideas but it comes down into our life so we said lord says should be lord make it make it that i could apply this i'm just talking to me man you know but yeah because it's got to be it's going to be more than all these big storms well what's the storm you know because if we say there's a storm outside it'll consist of a lot of wind a lot of rain and we kind of have an idea of the damage those things can do right you think tornado well you've seen footage of tornadoes or hurricanes or whatever you know but it's not some abstract idea it's really happened so it should be the same thing when when the prophet says there's great storms we are facing and great big clouds and different things now it's not a um it's not a mystery when i talk about atomic bombs and nuclear war we know that's gonna happen but there's other storms that we've got to go through and brother mcs before the first bomb drops the bride's out of here but there's storms that we are facing now i don't know if you've realized but we're actually living in a hurricane this world is a hurricane of of demon power but greater that is in you that is in the hurricane that is in the storm so we don't need to be afraid you know we've already got the armor that doesn't matter what the wind blows our way it's just going to go and go off you know what was that i don't know praise the lord i'm still here but so to me its demon powers are running amuck in the end time now brother brown i mean sorry the apostle paul would say in ephesians 4 it says until we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man until the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ in ephesians 4 and 14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive now when it comes to every wind of doctrine it's not just christians or religion that has doctrine atheism is a doctrine evolution is a doctrine it's not a theory it's a doctrine so every socialism is a doctrine communism is a doctrine any teaching is well adoption is a teaching so it's not just a religious thing it's actually the whole world transhumanism people want to merge man and machine together that they become immortal that's a teaching people are actually investing their energy and life to actually make it happen why because it's a doctrine but with every doctrine there's a spirit attached to that doctrine because spirits travel on words jesus will say in john 6 and 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you thy spirit and their life so what was he doing he was teaching them there was doctrine coming out that was with power of the holy ghost i'm kind of slowing down because i just want to i don't want this just to pass us by maybe past me but i don't know but you know but so doctrine is a teaching and this spirit's attached to doctrine and to me now this is part of the great storm of this hurricane of this world that we're living in is this every wind of doctrine is blowing around and i'm not just talking within the message circles i'm talking about the whole world now people's lives are a manifestation of the doctrine they believe whether they're aware of it or not so adoption you believe is something you agree with and the devil twists our minds to say things are acceptable that's why we do them right if the world do not think what they do is acceptable they wouldn't do it if they thought it was actually wrong and they knew the penalty behind it they wouldn't do it so i pray that our lives are a manifestation of the doctrine of the scripture of the message right because if we have pure doctrine then we have the holy ghost living in our lives amen so now if we go to romans chapter 1 the apostle paul speaks of a process where people fall from worshiping god into a very dark and deprived state now this has happened in this time too history has repeated itself he's not just pointing backwards it's actually right now now when i read this i want you to pick up on two things they weren't thankful they glorified him not as god and they didn't want to retain god in their knowledge okay so we go to romans 1 and 18. for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness so they think the truth is unrighteous they're not interested in it because they because that which may be known of god is manifest because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse remember brother braham said his first bible was nature he could see god in nature and anyone anyone who really looks into nature they should be able to see god for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made so i'm just repeating this again even as eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were they neither were thankful we've got to stay thankful amen and but became vain in their imaginations and their and their foolish hearts was dark and so that it's not like they didn't have any imagination it just became vain it became empty professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made like two corruptable men and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their um through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of god into a lie and worship them serve the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever amen for this course god gave them up unto vile of affections for even their woman to change the natural use that uh into that which is against nature man i've got formatting funny and wait i print these things off but i um the top of my page is all formatted wrong so it's cut off half way hold on romans 1 and 26. and likewise also men leaving the natural use of women burned in their last one towards another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was met and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge they didn't want to re see they didn't want to become god conscious they did not want to be god conscious there used to be a time when society was god conscious that's why you read about the you know great revivals and evangelists back a hundred odd years ago they would preach and people just fall under conviction in the street why because there's a god consciousness in society they realized that there was a holy god and wrath was going to fall on them unless they received jesus christ and you know who's who's with those kind of right because people were god conscious they retained god and their knowledge but they've come to a point where man doesn't want to retain god in their knowledge sadly many people just think jesus christ is a curse word but it's the name above all names that's the name of the very lord of glory um god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignancy whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciable i mean unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them so people can fall to such a state that they actually have pleasure when they see other people doing these things you know there was if i can find some people say now i've i'm sure we can agree the world is in this state this is why i say this world's a hurricane yeah because this doesn't there's no neutral ground or you could say there's no no man's land everything there's no void and these things will try and come in to us if we let them people say my body my choices it should actually be my body my responsibility and that goes for men and women right but but that's just the thing my body my choice i'll do what i know your body your responsibility because everyone will have to give an account before the judgment seat of god amen so you know there was this is a few years ago when when the game of thrones was trending i trust no one's seen an episode i have not for myself but there was outrage and this was in the news there was outrage because in a lot of well in some episodes i don't know how many there was rape and inci in incest not to mention the violence the adultery fornication and witchcraft going on and people were outraged by it but yet they watched it and the author said well that's what the characters like to do so it's fine and people just accepted that it's art is it what does that mean it's art but people just lapped it up what is that having pleasure people watching it having pleasure in them that do them see what is that that's that's darkness and now what happens is the devil raises the shock factor so what becomes acceptable comes a lot well really i can say he loves the shock factor makes things a lot more deprived and then so what's acceptable can be far more worse than what it was even just a few years ago what is that because people don't want to retain god in their knowledge they just want to do what they want to do so god gives them over to these things you don't want to be caught up in that kind of wind that kind of storm because those things creep in and affect everything else that people watch so we've got to be very careful what we allow to come into our spirit because this is where the storm comes in right the eyes the window to the soul now if you want to be destabilized then fill yourself up with these things if you want to be stabilized stay with the word who wants to live an overcoming life stay with the lord jesus now that may be an extreme example i said about game of thrones but it now affects everything that is out there yeah it's amazing you know our bodies this is back in 1958 the value of the chemicals in the bot that made up the body according to the profit was 84 american cents you take all the calcium everything that's me you boil it all down the value of those elements is 84 cents back in 1958. something about two bucks or something i don't know now so but people will spend their whole life looking after these 84 cents everything they do they'll be very very careful but when it comes to their spirit or their soul which is eternal they will just pump anything into it they're not even worried you know brother brown would say you'll go to a restaurant and you would pick up a bowl of soup and it had a fly in it you'd turn it down that quick wouldn't you you go to a buffet i mean you get placed a meal in this and there's a dead fly in your whatever source do you think you're just going to eat that up and say well that's good protein no you look you'll complain you'll refuse to put that into your body right and he says here yes sir i would have nothing to do with that well i'll see if the paper knows it the chamber of commerce what about the president of the restaurant the owner see and then if i could bring up today uh bring it to today's language i'll put a google review on this restaurant i'll give it zero stars i want everyone to know there's flies in the soup bring it to today's language you see you watch that 84 cents you won't put nothing you won't put nothing poisonous in it but let the devil pack anything in that soul that he desires to and that soul's eternal that's right so we don't want to just put you know we care about this thing what about our soul we don't want to be caught up in the storm i say this hurricane of this age brother abraham says that this is a new erotic age i'm just going to finish with these comments mental mental illness is rife in this time and it doesn't matter how much the government pumps into it praise the lord for all they can do but we know they can only do so much because they psychologists never go into spirits and things like that right but this age is full of mental illness and brother abraham even says in the church book it doesn't seem to make sense i'm just paraphrasing very loosely it doesn't make sense that people are so depressed on so many prescription drugs to keep their mood balanced because we have everything we have we we man we you know some of the food that we just have for dinner the emperors julius caesar didn't eat this good the great kings or whoever you know cleopatra didn't eat this good oh oh whoever you know genghis khan or what's you know some great emperor they don't eat half as good as what we do amen we we better than the emperors every day we got way better yeah everything we have is far better than whatever they had but yet for some reason mental illness is gripping the hat well has gripped the world and he calls it a neurotic age now neurotic means now i can't remember what website i got this from sorry says neurotic means you're you're afflicted by new uh neurosis a word that's been used since the 1700s to describe mental emotional or physical reactions that are drastic and irrational at its root a neurotic behavior is an automatic unconscious effort to manage deep anxiety we're not meant to have anxiety be anxious for nothing but this is the world we live in we're not called to have deep anxiety we're called to have deep peace remember remember the prophet stood and preached shalom peace god's peace be upon you and i just said god's peace be upon me that you became the me hallelujah amen says in 1980 an american psychiatric association or the american um psychiatric association removed the term uh neurosys from its diagnostic manual as a part of a revamp to stand desire to standardize the criteria for mental illness today neurosis is not a standalone mental condition i said doctors most often put it symptoms in the same category as anxiety disorder in other words what what used to be called neurosis falls under the umbrella of anxiety this world is anxious why because we're in a storm and they don't know what's causing the storm and they have no stabilizers but if we have stabilizers we can be in the storm you know those big container ships they go through hurricanes sometimes they just they just keep sailing hallelujah remember brother ram says what you see in the natural with the technological advancements it's just a reflection of what god is doing in the spiritual i mean so it used to be little boats could never get through hurricanes that's why there's shipwrecks everywhere but nowadays they just go through if they can and they see the storm coming afar off by satellite navigation and they just bypass the whole thing what about in the spiritual i've got stabilizers how about you hallelujah amen that we don't need to have deep anxiety but we can have a deep peace hallelujah amen now i'm just going to finish with this because i feel that we're out of time now this deep peace we have now if you don't have it you can get it we don't have to put up with the storm right it may be blowing out there but not in here it may be a storm in there but not in me right we don't have to live with it now you think about the prophecies where it becomes personal where the apostle paul would say they which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which is you know a sleep of dead in christ shall rise first he says but that we which are alive and remains of the coming of lord shall not prevent them which are sleeps think about the rapture cycle i trust that we have become me amen where the lord has revealed that scripture because why you're a predestinated vessel at a predestined time when there's a fulfillment of the prophecy hallelujah just like meredith anchors into your soul i'm part of that number hallelujah in 2nd corinthians 5 and 1 for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens i trust that we becomes me for i know if this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved i have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens hallelujah you know the prophet tells us an enticing spirits give me a preacher give me a christian give me a housewife that's a christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put god first and everything i'll show you a man that will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him amen he seeks god first hallelujah it doesn't matter what storm's blowing that person will be successful amen because they put god first [Music] hallelujah the apostle paul would say this he says in romans 8 more over whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified i trust this is personal to you amen what shall we say to these things have god before us who can be against us so the storm can be the biggest in history but if god is for me what can be against me hallelujah he that spared not his own son but delivered up for us all how shall um how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall they charge who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it's god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who maketh intercession for us hallelujah i trust those kind of scriptures to become personal it's not to someone else but if god is for me who can be against me hallelujah whom he called i've been called he's also justified i've been justified whom he justified he is also glorified hallelujah brother abraham says that that god wants to manifest his revelation in you and i where it's actually a personal walk between you and god upon this rock the revelation of who he is i'll build my church and brother braham would say that all hell not against so so this is not to a see he says it goes right by then i'm just going to finish with this quote i promise i'm not going to about to close i will it goes right by them they don't recognize till it's gone speaking about when truth comes and then it moves on then then people begin to glorify what's happened in the past it only picks up the predecessor that god predestined before the foundation of the earth the same thing came through in the days of noah the same thing came through in the days of moses days of elijah days of the prophets days of jesus down through to this very hour the pregnant person with the seed of god uh the word in there manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of god that the word and the word alone manifests itself in this person the prisoner to an individual not say my church my church has nothing to do with it it's an individual one person and and the prophet says all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth it means it's when god reveals himself manifests himself in you jesus never said now peter you and john all the rest of the people you've got the revelation now the whole church is saved no it is to him personally i say unto thee not to them to thee thou art peter upon this rock i'll build my church and the word peter means stone stone means confess one or the separated one upon a certain stone upon a certain thing see i called out the church called out upon the stone upon this revelation flesh and blood never revealed it to you but upon this revelation called out group i'll build my church in them and or and all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it not one hair of your head shall perish your mind i'll raise you up on the last day give unto him eternal life raise him up at the last days there it is the revelation not them but him an individual not a group an individual all hell is against it but his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one who can see it hallelujah amen so it's got to be i just trust at the end of this well say is the lord personal to you have you met him amen then if you have met him like mary did hallelujah your whole life will be different and just go walk on let him be the stabilizer let his word be the stabilizer in your life no matter what storms come and go let him be the stabilizer in your life remember he said the stabilizer is already in the boat in the ship we'll go through great storms but the great captain is calling from the other side we're just nearly about to reach shore soon and very soon we're going to see the king hallelujah oh it could be 50 years i don't know i believe it could be today why not everything's in order everything's ready but the chief captain is calling from the other side and my father's house of many mansions everyone so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you i trust that's personal and i'll and if i do i'll come again and receive you to myself that where i am you shall be also what is this message done it's come to receive a people amen to the lord jesus himself to carry them away shouldn't that give us great stability hallelujah amen let's stand this morning aiming for the musicians please amen praise the lord amen let's um let's sing that song leaning on the everlasting
