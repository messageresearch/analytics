[4:17] good
[4:19] morning welcome to the house of God this
[4:21] morning brother Andy
[4:23] hello
[4:25] Roman uh it's good to be it's good to be
[4:27] here it's good to um
[4:30] be in a place that we can Worship the
[4:31] Lord this
[4:34] morning and um yeah it's you know it's
[4:37] funny getting the songs together hope
[4:39] you don't mind me I like to talk at the
[4:40] start cuz I kind of like to
[4:43] like I got to get to know you man like I
[4:46] got to connect I can't just like
[4:48] start it's kind of you know when you
[4:51] warm up a vehicle you got to sort of
[4:52] like a diesel you sort of turn it on you
[4:53] got to let it run for a bit you
[4:55] know get it kind of I get to know you
[4:58] you get to know me
[5:00] even though we know each other it's
[5:01] different but um you know I was thinking
[5:04] this morning that
[5:07] um I pick out songs you sort of feel
[5:09] like I should do this one and that one
[5:11] and you kind of try and at least somehow
[5:13] get inspiration to know what what songs
[5:15] you that I should pick you know to sing
[5:19] and I don't know what the message is or
[5:22] anything like that I just feel like okay
[5:24] I should do this one and that one and
[5:26] and you go on a leading you know that's
[5:27] what you do when you when you when you
[5:28] serve the Lord
[5:30] um but every now and then I pick one for
[5:35] me like I ignore all that and I pick one
[5:37] for me but but but I think there's a
[5:40] scripture that says Thou shalt
[5:44] not no it says don't muzzle the ox that
[5:47] Treads out the corn meaning if there's
[5:49] this Ox that's doing all this work and
[5:53] like treading out all this corner and
[5:55] working and working if at any point in
[5:57] time that Ox wants to like reach down
[5:59] and just take some of that corn for
[6:00] itself let it don't put something on its
[6:04] mouth that it can't just you know after
[6:05] all its labor just go and eat some when
[6:07] it wants to and so I think I'm I'm sort
[6:09] of getting these together and I think
[6:11] you know I have to labor week in week
[6:13] out practice plan do all this stuff I'm
[6:17] like you know if at any point in time I
[6:19] want to choose a song for me I'm going
[6:22] to I'm going to put my I'm going to put
[6:25] my mouth down and eat some of the Corn
[6:30] so the first song I've got is is there's
[6:32] a song called when the role is Called Up
[6:34] Yonder and and you know it seems like
[6:36] it's a song that you'd sing it's about
[6:38] me but I have a it's it always speaks to
[6:40] me when I sing it because it's actually
[6:41] something more powerful than than that
[6:45] because you know we have desires in our
[6:48] hearts so we all have a desire some of
[6:50] them are strong desires some of them are
[6:52] lesser desires but we all have desires
[6:54] in our
[6:55] hearts you
[6:57] agree and the Lord says if we Delight
[7:00] ourselves in him he'll give us the
[7:01] desires of our hearts now some of them
[7:02] we think oh well if I get that happy if
[7:04] I don't whatever some of them are a bit
[7:06] stronger where we think I really want
[7:07] that and then some of them but I've got
[7:10] one desire on my heart that's
[7:11] non-negotiable it's just a
[7:12] non-negotiable desire I ain't
[7:14] negotiating with nobody on it it's it's
[7:16] it's off the table I don't care what
[7:17] push comes to shove where it happens
[7:19] I've got a desire that I'm not
[7:20] negotiating with anybody on either side
[7:22] ever it's like this one's
[7:26] non-negotiable and it's always been for
[7:28] the Salvation of my children
[7:30] it's always been a non-negotiable desire
[7:32] like I don't care who talks to me about
[7:33] it we ain't negotiating nothing on it
[7:35] ever ever and you know I think even if
[7:39] God will cast me into hell I'm still
[7:40] going to hold him to that desire say but
[7:43] yeah you can cast me aside but I'm not
[7:45] backing down on that
[7:46] one so when I sing this song when the
[7:48] role was caught up yonder I think I
[7:50] could just imagine you know when when
[7:52] might be about me but I'm thinking my
[7:54] all my children's names are going to be
[7:55] called they're going to be called when
[7:57] that role is called so every time I sing
[7:58] it that's why sometimes I I get
[7:59] emotional but it's like I just know
[8:01] that's what's going to happen so that's
[8:03] my song I chose for me this
[8:05] morning hey let's stand let's just
[8:07] worship uh let's open in
[8:09] prayer Lord we thank you that you give
[8:11] us the desires of our hearts Lord and I
[8:13] believe that's each desire of each one
[8:15] here this morning Lord that that that we
[8:18] all desire Lord that our children would
[8:19] be saved and serving you and we thank
[8:21] you for that promise that we have Lord
[8:23] and we we just thank you for your Lord
[8:24] that you meet every desire of our heart
[8:26] Lord Jesus and we just want to invite
[8:27] you into our midst Lord we know you're
[8:29] the great God Lord that not only knows
[8:31] our hearts and knows our desires Lord
[8:33] but you you're the one that can meet
[8:34] them Lord those things that we hold so
[8:36] dear Lord we we know Lord that if our
[8:39] heart's in the palm of your hand then
[8:40] you hold it there as well Lord so so we
[8:43] just want to come to you and lift our
[8:44] heart to you this morning Lord I pray
[8:45] that any desire Lord that's that's in
[8:48] any heart this morning that that would
[8:49] be met Lord Jesus Lord and and and thank

[39:49] um 2 Kings 6 and8 then the king of Syria
[39:51] wared against Israel and took counsel
[39:54] with his servants saying in such and
[39:56] such a place shall be my camp and the
[39:58] man of God said unto the king of Israel
[40:00] saying beware that thou pass not such a
[40:03] place for hither the syrians are come
[40:05] down and the king of Israel sent to the
[40:07] place which the uh man of God told him
[40:10] and warned him of and saved himself
[40:12] there not once but uh nor twice
[40:15] therefore the uh the heart of the king
[40:17] of Syria was so troubled for this thing
[40:19] and he called his servants and said unto
[40:21] them will ye not show me which of us is
[40:24] for the king of Israel and one of his
[40:26] servants said none my Lord oh King but
[40:29] Elisha the prophet that is in Israel tth
[40:31] the king of Israel the words that thou
[40:33] speaketh in thy bed chamber and he said
[40:36] go and spy where he is that I may send
[40:38] and fetch him and was told saying behold
[40:40] he is in Dothan therefore sent his uh he
[40:43] hither horses and chariots and a great
[40:45] host and they came by night and Compass
[40:47] the city about and when the servant of
[40:50] the man of God was risen early and gone
[40:53] forth Behold a host can pass the city
[40:56] both with horses and as my master what
[40:58] shall we do and he answered fear not for
[41:01] they that be with us are more than they
[41:03] that be with them and elishah prayed
[41:05] said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that
[41:07] he may see and the Lord opened his eyes
[41:10] of the young man and he saw and behold
[41:11] the mountains were full of horses and
[41:13] Chariots of the fire of fire round about
[41:16] Elisha and when they came down to him
[41:18] Elisha prayed unto the Lord said Smite
[41:20] this people I pray thee with blindness
[41:21] and he smoke them with blindness
[41:23] according to the word of Elisha and
[41:24] Elisha said unto them this is not the
[41:26] way neither is this the city follow me
[41:28] and I will bring you to the man whom you
[41:30] seek but he led them to Samaria and it
[41:33] came to pass when they were come into
[41:35] Samaria that Elisha said Lord Open the
[41:37] Eyes of these men that they may see and
[41:40] the Lord opened their eyes and they saw
[41:41] and behold they were in the midst of
[41:43] Samaria and the king of Israel said unto
[41:45] Elisha when he saw uh when he saw them
[41:48] my father shall I smite them shall I
[41:50] smite them course I don't have it here
[41:53] but we know the rest of the story Elisha
[41:55] says now feed them and send them home
[41:57] amen but uh let's pray this morning
[41:59] shall we amen gracious father we're so
[42:02] thankful we can have this Grand
[42:03] opportunity to stand in your presence
[42:05] once again Lord Lord on this side of the
[42:07] veil Lord and praise your great name for
[42:09] all you've done for us we thank you
[42:11] truly Lord we can say your goodness and
[42:13] your Mercy's been running after us Lord
[42:15] we praise your Holy Name Lord this day
[42:17] we're asking father may you walk among
[42:18] us one more time may you touch every
[42:21] heart touch every life Lord we Just Want
[42:23] To Praise Your Great Name this morning
[42:24] we love you we asking your blood would
[42:26] cover us each one
[42:27] Lord be with those who are streaming as
[42:29] well Lord those who are away traveling
[42:30] and be be their abundant portion Lord we
[42:32] love you so much we thank you for your
[42:34] great word that we could read now we ask
[42:36] you to anoint speaker and hearer Lord
[42:37] may you make it live For Your Glory in
[42:39] Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God
[42:42] bless you friends you can have your
[42:43] seats this morning so I want to I want
[42:45] to speak about seeing
[42:47] today
[42:49] and the if we look so I got a few
[42:53] scriptures to read here but I just want
[42:54] to go back to this cuz often we take the
[42:58] um you know we take the scripture of of
[43:00] Revelations 3 and the conditions of our
[43:02] age and you it says in verse 18 I
[43:05] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried and
[43:07] the fire thou mayest be rich white rment
[43:08] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[43:10] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[43:12] anoint thine eyes with I have that thou
[43:14] mayest see now there's some people that
[43:17] have taken this instruction on board
[43:19] amen and I believe I'm looking at them
[43:21] this morning there's those who have
[43:22] actually tooken the counsel of the word
[43:24] of God and they've heard the voice of
[43:26] God they've come out to to him they've
[43:27] opened up their hearts God's come in
[43:29] amen and now they're now they're not
[43:31] blind anymore but they can see am mean
[43:33] they're not naked anymore they're
[43:35] dressed amen and they have uh character
[43:37] tried in the fire God's own character in
[43:39] their life now if we go back to uh if we
[43:43] go back to um Second Kings here we see
[43:47] there were certain things that people
[43:49] could see now quite often what happens
[43:51] when we're walking with the Lord is is
[43:53] is Trouble Comes because God is in us
[43:56] God is walking with us you know it's
[43:58] like when Israel came into the promised
[44:00] land they didn't really have to go
[44:02] looking for the enemy to fight the enemy
[44:03] came looking for them on many occasion
[44:05] you know they banded together they tried
[44:07] to overthrow Israel but you you know
[44:09] it's like us in our walk the enemy tries
[44:11] to find us because he wants to stop us
[44:12] in our
[44:14] tracks but I say if God is in us we're
[44:16] Unstoppable because he's the Unstoppable
[44:19] one and he's very determined to have his
[44:21] word fulfilled and he's going to find
[44:23] someone to fulfill it and I believe
[44:24] that's you and I this morning so now we
[44:26] can see gazi he went out in the morning
[44:29] and he was worried because the enemy
[44:31] tried to come and find um Elisha and
[44:34] capture him isn't it amazing that it was
[44:36] obviously somehow the servant of the
[44:38] king of Syria knew that what what what
[44:41] he was saying in his bed chamber was now
[44:42] known in Israel I don't know how that
[44:44] was tied together but and isn't it
[44:45] interesting that you know that God did
[44:47] not deliver Israel just once or twice
[44:49] but more than that quite often God would
[44:51] as soon as the king of Syria would send
[44:53] out the orders it's like in real time
[44:55] you know it was it was broadcast there
[44:56] too to the prophet and and you know the
[44:58] prophet made it known to the king and
[45:00] and so the prophet could see things that
[45:02] that the natural eye could not see he
[45:04] could see things that were far away from
[45:06] him and even you know God is in such a
[45:08] way he will show you things that have
[45:10] happened and will happen you know like
[45:12] the prophet would stand there and he you
[45:13] know you know when the anointing would
[45:15] come down and you that you know uh
[45:17] Christ was there and he would you know
[45:19] the uh uh God would reveal the secrets
[45:21] and tense of the people's hearts he
[45:22] would often tell people you know like
[45:24] people who had had an operation they
[45:25] were on the table and there was a heavy
[45:27] set doctor a thin doctor he had
[45:29] described the scene and um you you know
[45:31] they would um you look at look at the
[45:33] person shake their head sew them back up
[45:35] and all these things you know the
[45:37] prophet was transported back in time or
[45:39] taken he say I see you looking out the
[45:41] window you got dizzy spells and all
[45:43] these different things so he was
[45:44] transported in by Vision into these
[45:46] different places now there's a reason
[45:48] God did that to show that God's mindful
[45:51] of Our Lives see see see gazi was
[45:53] panicking he saw he just saw a part of
[45:55] the picture right now we know the prayer
[45:58] of Elisha did not bring the armies of
[46:00] Israel down he did not his prayer did
[46:03] not say Lord send your armies around me
[46:05] now I need them he prayed Lord open his
[46:08] eyes that he would realize who is there
[46:12] already and and I believe friends that
[46:15] the Unseen realm is is is so seeable by
[46:18] faith in this day am me that the armies
[46:20] of heaven and we'll go through it
[46:22] quickly before we jump to some other
[46:23] things the armies of Heaven have always
[46:25] been around God's elected ones they have
[46:28] always been present they've never been
[46:30] absent they've never been distant
[46:31] they've always been around and I'd say
[46:33] it's even greater in this day cuz it's
[46:35] not just the angels of God around us but
[46:36] it's Christ in you the hope of glory I
[46:39] mean because this was this is what the
[46:40] message restores is Christ the true
[46:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost the word of
[46:45] God alive in his people once again am
[46:47] mean so to me it's incredible we can
[46:49] actually Sur we see the problems Elisha
[46:51] didn't say no that's not such a bad
[46:53] thing he didn't discount what what what
[46:56] they were going through but he just said
[46:57] Lord open his eyes that he'd see the
[46:59] whole picture and then I think the you
[47:01] know to me gazi he was probably would
[47:03] have been more shocked to see the armies
[47:05] of Heaven than the armies of the enemy
[47:08] there on the
[47:10] ground amen so you see now there is a as
[47:13] we read in Revelations chapter 3 there
[47:15] is a blindness that is upon the upon the
[47:18] age and brother Braham says that this
[47:21] this blindness is like the same
[47:23] blindness that uh that Elijah smokee the
[47:27] um syrians with you know many times if
[47:29] you looking like some kind of Bible
[47:31] cartoon you know it's like these people
[47:34] become completely blind they got to hold
[47:35] on to each other and their lead but they
[47:38] could see but they couldn't see
[47:39] everything they couldn't see the prophet
[47:41] in front of them and isn't it amazing
[47:43] that you know Elisha after he smoked
[47:45] them blind he told them you're at the
[47:47] wrong place but beforehand they knew
[47:49] they at the right place this is Dothan
[47:51] we've seen this place before but you see
[47:53] the blindness caused them to not
[47:55] understand where they were standing
[47:56] standing in that present moment and so
[47:59] now so so blindness will cause people
[48:01] not to realize where they are now I'm
[48:03] not saying we're blind we can see the
[48:05] message of the hour has opened our eyes
[48:07] the Holy Ghost ice have has come down
[48:09] into the church I mean that we can see
[48:11] the full picture now sometimes we can we
[48:14] can get our eyes can get glazed over
[48:16] that doesn't mean we're blind though
[48:17] that means we've just taking our eyes
[48:18] off the right thing right like John the
[48:20] Baptist you think about an adopted son
[48:22] of God fulfilled the scripture that he
[48:24] was meant to fulfill a voice crying you
[48:26] one crying in the wilderness right so he
[48:28] fulfilled his mission behold he's the
[48:30] Lamb of God takes away the sin of the
[48:32] world but when he ended up in prison
[48:33] brother BR said his eagle eyes glazed
[48:35] over but did God leave him in that
[48:38] condition no but you see the reason he
[48:40] was in that condition is because his
[48:42] expect his human expectations weren't
[48:44] being met he thought no doubt the
[48:47] messiah's going to he you know because
[48:48] he said he's going to um what thoroughly
[48:50] Purge his floor take his fan in his hand
[48:52] and Purge the floor and every Mountain
[48:54] Will Made low every Valley made High and
[48:56] all these great things messiah's going
[48:58] to do and here comes the lowely man of
[49:00] Galilee the Lamb of God remember but you
[49:03] see so as human expectation was
[49:05] different to what God's uh uh God's plan
[49:08] was and because of disappointment his
[49:11] eagle eyes glazed over in prison but as
[49:14] I said before did God leave him in that
[49:16] condition absolutely not you see because
[49:18] there's something that God wants us to
[49:20] see the Fulfillment of his word and mean
[49:23] he wants us to see that we're part of
[49:24] that fulfillment because when he sent
[49:26] his when Jesus sent his disciples you
[49:29] think how brother BR would say that when
[49:30] John sent his disciples just a backtrack
[49:33] to to to Jesus it was the you know one
[49:36] of the worst questions he could have
[49:37] asked the Lamb of God are you him or do
[49:39] we look for another and he pointed him
[49:42] out in the water but he said because of
[49:44] disappointment his eyes glazed over but
[49:46] then the Lord did not want him to stay
[49:48] in that state so he said go tell John
[49:51] you just sit here see what happens in
[49:52] the meetings and you see the eyes come
[49:54] open the blind the Dead rais the sick
[49:56] healed demons cast out and then go tell
[49:58] John what you've seen amen so John now
[50:01] heard evidence a testimony that he had
[50:04] pointed out the right man Hallelujah so
[50:07] then he could Rejoice saying Lord I have
[50:09] fulfilled my part of your word that
[50:10] you've allotted to me I mean now I can
[50:13] just rejoice and take courage and rest
[50:15] in what you have done friends our end
[50:19] destination is a
[50:20] Rapture right that's our end destination
[50:23] right and we're going to keep that and
[50:25] very much in the Forefront of our minds
[50:27] and in our hearts that the Lord soon and
[50:29] very soon is going to sweep there's
[50:30] going to sweep come over the church and
[50:32] he's going to catch us away amen because
[50:35] the armies of Heaven are actually a
[50:36] transport hallu we'll come to it amen
[50:39] it's it's it's actually a transport as
[50:41] as I would say in the song of um Song of
[50:44] Solomon he'd say my Dove my undefiled is
[50:47] but one she's the only one of her mother
[50:49] she has the choice of of the one of her
[50:52] that bear her the daughter saw her and
[50:54] blessed her and say yay the queens and
[50:56] the concubine finds they praise sir this
[50:58] what God says you're the you're his
[50:59] undefiled one see we got to look at
[51:02] ourselves as God looks at ourselves
[51:04] right he say well I've been through a
[51:05] lot of things but he says thank you Lord
[51:07] for the scars I thought it's so TI all
[51:09] those songs Just were such a beautiful
[51:11] arrangement thank you for the scars Lord
[51:13] then we say thank you for your scars
[51:15] Hallelujah yes can you look at your life
[51:17] and say thank you for the scars Lord oh
[51:19] but they ran very deep they're very big
[51:21] but thank you for the scars Lord thank
[51:23] you for the scars of rejection pain
[51:25] whatever's happened in life I say thank
[51:26] you for those Lord because without those
[51:28] Lord I would never know your heart just
[51:30] like job could sing that song Thank you
[51:32] for the scars Lord I lost my children I
[51:35] lost everything but thank you Lord cuz
[51:36] without that I'd still be sitting here
[51:38] wondering Lord yeah I've see I see yo yo

[51:43] see it in the sun and you know rising
[51:45] and descending I see plants dying and
[51:48] coming back to life but man where does
[51:49] he go he would still be in that state
[51:51] wondering what happens when he dies we
[51:53] say thank you for the scars Lord because
[51:55] youve revealed to me now I can say
[51:57] because of the scars you've spoken
[51:58] through those scars to say now I know my
[52:01] redeemer
[52:02] liveth Hallelujah as he I trust he
[52:05] spoken through your scars you can look
[52:07] back in life said Lord you spoke through
[52:08] those not just his scars is now Prince
[52:10] and his hands and feet but the scars in
[52:12] your life he spoken to you hallelujah
[52:16] hallelujah amen but we are his undefiled
[52:19] one we're a new creation we're a new
[52:21] creation I pray that we just have a
[52:23] victory dance and our hearts as as we go
[52:26] out these doors as we go through the
[52:28] rest of our life we say Lord I can
[52:30] praise you with the voice of Triumph
[52:32] because you've conquered HDE in the
[52:33] grave for me amen now he says here he um
[52:39] you go read about what brother B says in
[52:41] the about the later and AG the author of
[52:43] the creation of God brother R says it's
[52:45] not a it's not a a a um he he is not we
[52:49] are that new creation God has created us
[52:53] new by the new birth that's why we're
[52:55] his under defiled one cuz he created us
[52:57] undefiled we were born defiled but he
[53:00] created us undefiled by the blood of
[53:01] Jesus Christ
[53:04] hallelujah amen who is she that lookth
[53:06] forth as the morning Fair as the moon
[53:08] clear as the sun and terrible as an army
[53:11] with
[53:12] banners amen hallelujah amen I went down
[53:16] into the garden of nuts to see the
[53:17] fruits of the valley and to see whether
[53:19] the vine flourished and the pomegranates
[53:21] buttered orever I was aware my soul made
[53:24] me like the Chariots of of um ABAB
[53:28] however you say that ad return return oh
[53:31] oh shulamite return return that we may
[53:34] look upon thee what will we see in the
[53:36] shulamite as it were the company of two
[53:39] armies now those now now this company of
[53:41] two armies is speaks of a an an Earthly
[53:44] host and a Heavenly Host those are the
[53:46] two armies so so the question is what
[53:48] shall we see when we what shall we see
[53:51] in the shulamite now this is this is the
[53:52] bride this is Solomon's bride the
[53:55] shulamite right so so the question is
[53:57] what will we see when we see her says as
[53:59] it we're a company of two armies so so
[54:01] when the bride is seen seen it's not
[54:03] just a host on the Earth but a Heavenly
[54:06] Host that's that is with her amen she is
[54:09] as it were the company of two armies say
[54:11] that God's armies have never neglected
[54:14] his elected ones they have always been
[54:17] present they always will be present and
[54:19] they will remain present amen the ones
[54:21] who have been sent to the Earth to
[54:22] minister salvation unto you amen will
[54:25] attend to you and Glory am
[54:28] hallelujah amen that's why we can
[54:30] Rejoice you know many times we look at
[54:32] the look at the darkness of this age
[54:34] just like gazi saw the enemies around
[54:37] the city but it's just half the picture
[54:39] the other half is far powerful and has a
[54:41] far greater impact than than than the
[54:43] scene am mean so he saw the trouble he
[54:46] saw that they were in big trouble the
[54:48] world sees as I said this this blindness
[54:50] that has come into this age causes
[54:52] people to see some things and not see
[54:53] other things so even gazi was under bit
[54:56] of blindness he was cuz he was just
[54:57] seeing the problems that they were
[54:59] facing day to day where's my next
[55:01] paycheck going to come how's this going
[55:03] to happen what's going to happen to my
[55:04] children what's going to happen to my
[55:05] family what about all these things he
[55:07] was only looking at those things but
[55:09] then the prophet said just Lord open his
[55:11] eyes that he can see the full picture I
[55:13] mean then isab was applied to his eyes
[55:15] said Lord and he realized the armies of
[55:17] Heaven wereth the prophet amen I say the
[55:19] armies of Heaven are with the bride of
[55:21] Jesus Christ today Hallelujah now this
[55:24] this uh uh my soul made me like like the
[55:26] Chariots of am dab or D or however you
[55:30] say that now there's a question about
[55:32] what these chariots mean I did a bit of
[55:34] a research and some say that these
[55:36] chariots were princely chariots they
[55:38] Royal chariots but far greater than the
[55:40] best chariots that Solomon had but
[55:42] they're actually the Chariots of the
[55:44] Heavenly Host they were God's chariots
[55:47] amen so when when the bride when the
[55:49] bride comes into the manifestation
[55:51] there's a there's a great yearning a cry
[55:55] in the heart of God
[55:57] my chariots are going to snatch her away
[56:00] Hallelujah this is what the armies of
[56:02] Heaven are come to do not just to
[56:04] protect us but to carry us away Amen in
[56:07] God's appointed time they're going to
[56:08] snatch us away and just like brother
[56:10] Bram was when when he was caught Pastor
[56:12] kurur in a time he was there before he
[56:14] realized he was there amen he was there
[56:17] remember he was lying on his bed like
[56:18] this and he was 50 something years old
[56:20] said Lord you know if I want to do
[56:22] something for God I better do it now and
[56:24] a voice H him would you like to see
[56:25] Pastor curtain of time and he just said
[56:28] it would help me so much and he and he
[56:30] was out of his body before he realized
[56:32] he was out of his body and then you he
[56:33] saw the young you know the redeemed 18
[56:36] to 21 or the height of their youth amen
[56:38] running towards them AR ra and white
[56:40] these ones weren't defiled these ones
[56:42] weren't naked in their sin they were
[56:44] robed in white amen they run to my
[56:47] precious brother my precious brother
[56:49] amen and then he you know put his head
[56:50] up in his hand he uh his hand on his
[56:53] head he felt a full head of hair and
[56:55] realized he was young just like that so
[56:57] he was there before he realized he was
[56:59] there friends there's going to be a
[57:00] change in our bodies before we realize
[57:02] there's going to be a change in our
[57:03] bodies I mean there's going to be you
[57:05] know God is going to change us before we
[57:07] realize we're ever going to be changed I
[57:09] believe we're looking for that season
[57:10] right now we're living in the season of
[57:12] the Resurrection Hallelujah if we could
[57:14] just see that amen amen amen so there's
[57:17] a company even even Jacob Jacob when he
[57:20] was on his way to return to um God told
[57:23] him go back to you know go back to the
[57:24] promised land go back to your father
[57:26] house he's on his way to see to see um
[57:29] um Esau he's just uh previous to this in
[57:32] uh Genesis 31 this is when he parted
[57:35] ways with leban and isn't it interesting
[57:37] that when when Jacob went on his way the
[57:39] angels of God met him and now so so to
[57:43] me it's like well isn't that incredible
[57:45] that before because Jacob's about to go
[57:47] through a change he didn't realize that
[57:49] he just thought he's going to try and uh
[57:51] mend mend Bridges with Esau but in the
[57:54] process God's going to wrestle with
[57:57] and that desire that he's had in his
[57:58] heart for a change of life I mean to no
[58:00] longer be a Jacob but to be in Israel to
[58:03] be changed amen because everyone
[58:04] wrestles with their Humanity everyone
[58:07] everyone really doesn't like who they
[58:09] are necessarily right but you see so so
[58:12] on his way to a change the the angels of
[58:15] the Lord meet him and then so God
[58:17] changes his name from from from Jacob to
[58:19] Israel after this when he wrestles with
[58:21] the angel of the Lord and He Walks
[58:23] different God touches his leg and he's
[58:25] got to walk different and he's got a
[58:26] different name and to me that shows that
[58:28] the you know there's a body change
[58:31] coming amen our names being changed but
[58:33] there's a body change coming so the
[58:35] angels of God came to meet him before a
[58:37] body change now we've had a visitation
[58:38] of seven angels Mount you know on Mount
[58:41] Sunset what is that signifying as the
[58:43] brides returning back into Glory A
[58:45] change is coming because angels are
[58:47] appearing amen that God has come down
[58:49] upon the Earth why because the change is
[58:51] coming and I say praise the lord we can
[58:54] see that change is coming that's right
[58:56] amen we're living in that season that's
[58:58] right amen and even it would say in
[59:00] Psalms you know Jesus would even say in
[59:02] the New Testament when you know he's
[59:04] about to be you know um you know uh
[59:06] what's his name Judas has betrayed him
[59:08] he's in the garden and you know he tells
[59:10] Peter Peter I could call was it 12
[59:12] Legions of Angels or however many they
[59:14] were encamped about him waiting just
[59:16] waiting for a nod one of them would have
[59:18] changed the whole scene but the Lord
[59:20] said no I've got to fulfill this part of
[59:22] the word this is the reason I'm here and
[59:24] many times we wonder Lord why don't you
[59:26] intervene on a case it's cuz God's got
[59:28] to fulfill his word I mean God's got to
[59:30] use you to fulfill his word it may not
[59:32] be nice it may be a bit it may be very
[59:35] difficult hard but God you you know you
[59:38] we think God doesn't care he does care
[59:40] but he's got to fulfill his
[59:42] word amen it say in Psalms 34:7 the
[59:46] angel of the Lord encamps about those
[59:47] that fear Him and delivers them amen so
[59:51] there's a there's a certain thing just
[59:55] like the as we read about the men uh the
[59:59] the um Syrian Army could see certain
[1:00:02] things but they couldn't see certain
[1:00:04] things they couldn't see now where they
[1:00:05] were when they were made blind and they
[1:00:07] couldn't see that they're on the way to
[1:00:09] Samaria but then God opened their eyes
[1:00:12] and they could see after that right now
[1:00:15] brother R would say that this is this is
[1:00:17] the condition of the uh age here he says
[1:00:21] he says they were yeah blind and naked
[1:00:24] now that is really desperate how can
[1:00:25] anyone blind and naked not know it yet
[1:00:28] it says that they are blind and naked
[1:00:29] and can't perceive it the answer is they
[1:00:31] are spiritually blind and spiritually
[1:00:33] naked do you remember when Elisha and
[1:00:35] gazi were surrounded by the army of the
[1:00:37] syrians you recall that Elisha smote
[1:00:39] them Blind by the power of God yet their
[1:00:42] eyes were wide open and they could see
[1:00:44] where they were going the blindness was
[1:00:46] peculiar and that they could see certain
[1:00:48] things but the other certain things such
[1:00:50] as Elisha and the servant in the camp of
[1:00:52] Israel they could not see what this Army
[1:00:56] um what this Army could see did not
[1:00:59] Avail for them what they did not see
[1:01:02] brought them on brought on their
[1:01:03] captivity now what does this mean to us
[1:01:05] it means exactly what it meant back
[1:01:07] there in the Earthly Ministry of Jesus
[1:01:09] he tried to teach them truth but they
[1:01:11] would not listen John 9:40 to 41 some of
[1:01:14] the Pharisees uh which were with them
[1:01:16] heard these words and they said unto
[1:01:17] them are we blind also Jesus said unto
[1:01:20] them if you were blind you should have
[1:01:21] no sin but now you say ye we see
[1:01:24] Therefore your sin remaineth he says the
[1:01:26] attitude of this age is exactly what it
[1:01:28] was then people have it all they know it
[1:01:30] all they cannot be taught so this is how
[1:01:33] you know you can see or not what's your
[1:01:35] attitude what's your attitude amen do
[1:01:38] you do you do you have an attitude well
[1:01:40] I know it all I know how the word all
[1:01:43] goes together I know how a Christian
[1:01:44] should be I know all these things and
[1:01:46] you cannot be taught see many things
[1:01:47] many times it's not doctrines we need to
[1:01:49] be taught in but it's attitudes it's how
[1:01:51] to forgive it's how to let go it's how
[1:01:53] to it's how to not try and manipulate
[1:01:55] control people all those things see see
[1:01:57] what happens to the scribes and
[1:01:59] Pharisees is they were not willing to be
[1:02:01] taught this was Messiah and their
[1:02:03] attitude was we're going to kill this
[1:02:04] guy you see and then when someone comes
[1:02:06] along to you and says well your children
[1:02:08] are this way you should do this or you
[1:02:10] know your attitude's this way you should
[1:02:11] stop being a gossip stop trying to
[1:02:12] slander people or why do you manipulate
[1:02:15] try and push me in a corner and put
[1:02:16] pressure on me and they get offended
[1:02:17] what is that that person's
[1:02:19] blind amen I know we've gone to a very
[1:02:22] serious part of the service but you see
[1:02:23] we got to realize are we teachable
[1:02:26] are we
[1:02:27] teachable I pray we are can we be
[1:02:30] adjusted well this is how I am this is
[1:02:32] how my upbringing was the New Birth
[1:02:34] changes everything amen the new birth
[1:02:37] changes everything amen it changes your
[1:02:39] attitude your personality it changes
[1:02:42] well whatever your parents did that's
[1:02:43] been destroyed in the blood of Jesus
[1:02:45] Christ in your life amen so there's no
[1:02:47] excuse to hold on to what you were or
[1:02:50] what you're raised in because God
[1:02:51] transforms his children I mean because
[1:02:54] the grace of God opens our eyes of
[1:02:56] understanding that we realize Lord I
[1:02:58] need to be changed amen so so we do not
[1:03:02] those who see do not think they have it
[1:03:04] all or know it all they want more of him
[1:03:07] amen that's that's the those who can see
[1:03:09] Lord You've Done many mighty things
[1:03:10] you've showed me many of your great
[1:03:12] Mysteries the great Treasures of your
[1:03:14] heart but Lord I want more of you amen
[1:03:16] the more you have the more you want amen
[1:03:19] hallelujah it's not like when you have a
[1:03:20] natural feast and you get stomach ache
[1:03:23] cuz you ate too much that's not the same
[1:03:24] with God no the more you eat the more
[1:03:26] you want and you don't get sick you just
[1:03:29] get happier you get more satisfied you
[1:03:31] rejoice more Hallelujah so we should
[1:03:33] never if you say you can't be taught
[1:03:36] they're wrong you get offended I say you
[1:03:38] need an isav AM and that isav is free
[1:03:42] without money or Price amen and it is an
[1:03:45] abundance amen it's in I I can't say
[1:03:47] excess but hey there's there's there's
[1:03:49] so much to go around that every single
[1:03:51] man woman and child could have this I
[1:03:53] have on their hearts and it wouldn't run
[1:03:55] out it wouldn't deplete it's just an
[1:03:57] abundance of I sa amen I say praise God
[1:04:00] that though maybe a you know like
[1:04:02] brother BR would say it's like when he
[1:04:03] was being raised and I can't put myself
[1:04:05] in his childhood you know when he was in
[1:04:07] that you know wood Log Cabin there was
[1:04:09] holes in the roof and it would snow and
[1:04:11] they had to put a tar poing over them as
[1:04:12] they slept and you know I can't put
[1:04:14] myself there but he would say when those
[1:04:17] cold mornings would come and his mom
[1:04:19] would try and wake them up you know they
[1:04:21] couldn't open their eyes they'd say
[1:04:23] they'd say Mom I can't open my eyes
[1:04:25] there's matter in in the matter in their
[1:04:26] eyes see what's the matter there's
[1:04:28] something in your eyes you see when
[1:04:30] people like gazi what was what was the
[1:04:33] matter with him he couldn't see some of
[1:04:36] you got it some of you get it tomorrow
[1:04:38] see that's why you asked the question
[1:04:40] what's the matter with
[1:04:41] you but if you can see there's no matter
[1:04:44] there we go you
[1:04:45] see Hallelujah you see but this when
[1:04:49] people are looking through a complex
[1:04:50] they're looking through a hurt they're
[1:04:52] looking through it's amazing the the
[1:04:54] anger and resentment and frustration and
[1:04:56] things that someone can build against
[1:04:58] someone just imagining
[1:05:00] them that's matter there's a big matter
[1:05:03] that needs to be removed out of that
[1:05:04] person's eyes you know cuz you can
[1:05:06] actually get it in your mind like I
[1:05:08] could get it in my mind that brother he
[1:05:10] doesn't like me I don't know how I could
[1:05:13] but it's that that crazy because the
[1:05:14] because he loves me I love him I know
[1:05:16] this is why I can use you right I could
[1:05:17] actually use anyone here but you know
[1:05:19] you see that I could get it in my the
[1:05:21] devil could twist it so much in my heart
[1:05:23] that brother he doesn't like me and I
[1:05:26] could build a complex around something
[1:05:28] that is not even
[1:05:30] real amen I'd say there's a matter
[1:05:33] that's got into my eyes then I need some
[1:05:35] eyes have of the Holy Ghost I mean to
[1:05:37] actually take that out of me that I can
[1:05:39] see no he loves me I love him we love
[1:05:42] the Lord we have all things in common
[1:05:44] amen we're we're we're brothers amen an
[1:05:47] eternal Brotherhood hallelujah amen
[1:05:49] what's that when when the Holy Ghost
[1:05:52] comes into the church you see there's a
[1:05:54] lot of cold drafts like brother BR when
[1:05:56] he was a kid there in the in the L cabin
[1:05:58] that caused a lot of matter to come into
[1:05:59] a lot of people's eyes but I think we
[1:06:01] should never let just a cold draft come
[1:06:03] in most people don't who like Sub-Zero
[1:06:07] temperatures everyday life you and you
[1:06:09] have no snow equipment and you got to
[1:06:11] live in it no there's some people who
[1:06:13] like building shelters in Alaska and
[1:06:15] things and I say they can have that I'm
[1:06:17] going to stay in the wom but you see
[1:06:20] most people will will will shut a door
[1:06:22] right there's a cold draft comes in you
[1:06:24] don't just oh that's you know when
[1:06:26] you're cold already whatever you you
[1:06:28] close it eh right you get warm you
[1:06:30] adjust your environment based on the
[1:06:33] draft to to exclude the draft right but
[1:06:36] the problem is many many times people
[1:06:38] will allow a draft to just keep blowing
[1:06:41] and it matters up their eyes it's like a
[1:06:43] thought comes in a cold draft those
[1:06:45] people don't really care that person's
[1:06:47] done this this is why this person's like
[1:06:50] this and all these negative things and
[1:06:51] you hear some stupid sulfuric acid of
[1:06:54] Gossip of hell and you let it just come
[1:06:56] in a cold draft and you know we should
[1:06:58] never murder anyone am me that you
[1:07:01] should never ever speak evil of anyone
[1:07:03] if there's something comes out of you
[1:07:04] saying that person this and how dare
[1:07:06] this and this person does this you need
[1:07:08] the Holy Ghost to come and give you a
[1:07:09] good eyes sa not just on your eyes but
[1:07:11] on your heart because that thing should
[1:07:13] stop with you say I do not want to pass
[1:07:15] this on I'm not a I'm not a skip I'm not
[1:07:19] a dump I'm not a trash can I mean you
[1:07:22] can take your trash and dump it
[1:07:24] somewhere else I'm not not interested in
[1:07:26] anything negative I just want to hear
[1:07:28] positive I want to hear God is real he's
[1:07:30] alive he can fix every situation why do
[1:07:33] we are why are we like gazis looking at
[1:07:35] the enemy when the armies of Heaven are
[1:07:38] around us all the time I mean the answer
[1:07:40] is present all the time which is him
[1:07:43] Hallelujah why do we get into that way
[1:07:45] so we should always adjust our lives a
[1:07:47] cold draft comes
[1:07:49] in we should close that door close that
[1:07:53] window how do you do that say no I'm not
[1:07:55] I'm not listening to that yes sir I'm by
[1:07:58] the fire Hallelujah and we don't have a
[1:08:00] painted fire around here in our lives we
[1:08:02] have a holy ghost burning fire amen if
[1:08:05] you ever get too much matter in your
[1:08:06] eyes you can't see clearly like you used
[1:08:08] to so for example you have such a joy
[1:08:10] when you meet the Lord the world's knew
[1:08:12] everything's great but then you just all
[1:08:14] you begin to see is the Troubles of life
[1:08:17] I say you've been standing in a draft
[1:08:19] but just like John he was standing in a
[1:08:21] draft of his own disappointments of what
[1:08:23] he thought Messiah would do but God sent
[1:08:25] some isav into the into the prison he
[1:08:28] didn't take him out of the prison he
[1:08:29] just changed John's perspective in the

[1:12:44] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:12:45] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:12:48] her husband and I heard a great voice
[1:12:50] out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:12:51] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[1:12:53] will dwell with them and they shall be
[1:12:54] his people people and God himself shall

[1:13:23] going and he said unto me it is I Alpha
[1:13:25] and Omega the beginning and the end I'll
[1:13:27] give unto him that is the thirst of the

[1:13:37] son Hallelujah you know God's talking
[1:13:39] about you God's talking about you in
[1:13:41] that scripture praise the Lord
[1:13:44] hallelujah why how our eyes have come
[1:13:47] open to what is really going on
[1:13:51] completely not just world events but
[1:13:54] what's God doing he
[1:13:55] events amen now praise the Lord
[1:14:00] amen hallelujah now John would I mean
[1:14:04] sorry the Apostle now let's just go I'm
[1:14:06] going to go back up to this verse
[1:14:09] here he says because we were talking
[1:14:12] we're driving up to um Tanga for
[1:14:14] Christmas I was just we just talked
[1:14:15] briefly Chris about you know you can't I
[1:14:17] was just talking to her about the fact
[1:14:19] you you think about the grace of God you
[1:14:21] know isn't it amazing that we we we know
[1:14:25] you know our eyes have come open that we
[1:14:27] came from God we're going back to God
[1:14:30] right we were in his mind as thoughts
[1:14:33] now but but he wanted fellowship with us
[1:14:35] he knew all about us but he wanted to
[1:14:36] fellowship with us he wanted to reveal
[1:14:38] all that he was to us so he puts us in
[1:14:40] this body of time and he walks with us
[1:14:42] all through life's journey and then he
[1:14:44] takes us up into eternity again and
[1:14:46] we're on the other side of Eternity then
[1:14:48] we can fully praise him for all he's
[1:14:50] done in our lives and as we're walking
[1:14:52] with him he reveals himself he proves
[1:14:54] his word and we just love him more and
[1:14:56] more as we walk with him don't you love
[1:14:57] him more today than you did maybe last
[1:14:59] week amen then you hear about how that
[1:15:02] we're in the that that are names before
[1:15:04] anything was made the lamb was slain and
[1:15:06] and and and God took the blood of the
[1:15:08] lamb and wrote your name in the Lamb's
[1:15:10] Book of Life and nothing in heaven or
[1:15:12] under the Earth or anything the devil
[1:15:14] can do can take your name off the Lamb's
[1:15:16] Book of Life amen that so so by election
[1:15:19] God knew us and he didn't chose us
[1:15:21] because of good behavior but he chose us
[1:15:23] because we're his just like our children
[1:15:26] our children are our
[1:15:28] children doesn't matter what they do
[1:15:30] where they go they're ours Hallelujah
[1:15:33] they're part of us we look into their
[1:15:34] eyes we see ourselves we see our
[1:15:36] mannerisms we see our characteristics
[1:15:38] you know we see our family in them those
[1:15:40] amazing going up and seeing the family
[1:15:42] all together you know William and and uh
[1:15:45] uh Albert and R's son Matthews too it's
[1:15:47] like you could basically put a mask on
[1:15:49] them and it's like they're twins cuz
[1:15:51] they do all the same kind of things you
[1:15:53] see that's my family Hallelujah this is
[1:15:55] my son that's that's his cousin that's
[1:15:56] my nephew you can see the family come
[1:15:58] together and God when he looks at you
[1:16:00] now not your Humanity but that seat on
[1:16:02] the inside of you he sees part of
[1:16:05] himself amen so so you know we know all
[1:16:08] these things but yet there's something
[1:16:11] about the grace of God it doesn't become
[1:16:13] common to a child of God it doesn't
[1:16:16] become just something we take for
[1:16:17] granted well I'm his child and that's
[1:16:19] just it no there's something in it that
[1:16:21] it it just builds a thankfulness it
[1:16:24] builds an appr
[1:16:25] appreciation let's experience that when
[1:16:27] you think about the because you know all
[1:16:29] those things we we we we we're
[1:16:31] predestinated we're elected to sunship
[1:16:33] amen we have a new body waiting for us
[1:16:35] we have a theophany that if this body be
[1:16:37] dissolved we have one Eternal in the
[1:16:38] heavens already amen we have a New
[1:16:41] Jerusalem that we're going to live in we
[1:16:42] got eternity to enjoy we got a Rapture
[1:16:45] to take you know all that because we're
[1:16:46] part of him but did you think Lord why
[1:16:49] me and it's not a pity party Lord I'm
[1:16:52] useless why me it's a Lord why me
[1:16:55] of all the 8 billion people I think upon
[1:16:57] the Earth today why me Lord why did you
[1:17:00] find me why did you come looking for me
[1:17:02] oh because you're part of him but yet
[1:17:04] why Lord who's ever had those kind of a
[1:17:07] thoughts now that really is a nice warm
[1:17:09] fire to get close to amen that really
[1:17:12] takes the I sa and really puts it in
[1:17:14] your eyes when you think Lord why me
[1:17:17] Hallelujah and I think in eternity that
[1:17:19] will be the question we'll always have
[1:17:21] we'll never really fathom the depths of
[1:17:24] why me
[1:17:25] yeah amen that's just how I feel I think
[1:17:28] the Apostle Paul had the same kind of a
[1:17:30] same kind of a heart there he says for
[1:17:32] you've heard of my conversation in times
[1:17:35] past in the Jews religion how that
[1:17:36] beyond measure I persecuted the Church
[1:17:38] of God and wasted and profited in the
[1:17:40] Jews religion above many my equals of my
[1:17:42] in my own Nation being more exceedingly
[1:17:45] zealous of the traditions of my fathers
[1:17:47] but when it pleased God hallelujah who
[1:17:50] separated me from my mother's womb and
[1:17:52] called me by his grace to re reveal his
[1:17:55] son in me see see but when it pleased
[1:17:58] God see we came to a season like gazi it
[1:18:00] actually pleased God to open his eyes to
[1:18:03] see the armies of Heaven are with the
[1:18:05] prophet with him amen it pleased see
[1:18:08] there came a season in our lives that it
[1:18:10] pleased God I'm going to I'm going to
[1:18:11] make myself known to that person I'm
[1:18:13] going to reveal myself I'm going to I've
[1:18:16] already sent Elijah to the earth now the
[1:18:19] message of Elijah is going to come into
[1:18:20] their lap and there's something in them
[1:18:22] it pleases me that they're going to
[1:18:24] receive it they're going to enjoy it
[1:18:27] amen they're going to become one with
[1:18:28] that word
[1:18:31] hallelujah amen see there's see grace
[1:18:33] like I think Dwight Moody when he when
[1:18:35] he read about uh from from Romans
[1:18:37] chapter 7 how Christ is Christ is we
[1:18:41] become dead to the law there's been a
[1:18:43] death more than just a divorce but
[1:18:45] there's a death from that first nature
[1:18:47] from the law and we're United with
[1:18:49] Christ he ran out on the street brother
[1:18:51] R says and the first person he says says
[1:18:53] do you know Grace
[1:18:55] and the person's prob startled said what
[1:18:57] do you mean he says the grace of God
[1:18:59] because he saw he saw how God had killed
[1:19:03] that first husband separated us from
[1:19:06] that First Union me that's why brother B
[1:19:08] said he preached a sermon an invisible
[1:19:10] Union of the Bride of you and Christ he
[1:19:13] says a Thanksgiving message where God
[1:19:15] would see we're going to see the whole
[1:19:16] picture I've been
[1:19:18] married amen I'm not married to my first
[1:19:20] age of my first birth no I've been
[1:19:22] United to the one who Resurrected I've
[1:19:25] been I've been United I've been married
[1:19:27] to Jesus Christ himself and brother B
[1:19:30] takes it further says that you were born
[1:19:32] before the foundation of world you had a
[1:19:34] you had a wedding band of unmar
[1:19:36] predestinated Grace slipped on your
[1:19:38] finger before you came to the Earth and
[1:19:41] no devil can take it off you Hallelujah
[1:19:45] I me I trust you see these things and
[1:19:47] rejoice with me amen that those things
[1:19:49] that we have been that that that first
[1:19:52] Nature's dead that first husband's dead
[1:19:54] not just put away he's been destroyed
[1:19:57] he's gone am mean we're not United with
[1:19:59] him no more we're United with the Living
[1:20:01] Word hallelujah we're been delivered
[1:20:04] amen from those things praise the Lord
[1:20:06] I'm just trying to find where I am
[1:20:08] Hallelujah you
[1:20:10] see gazi was no doubt thinking about how
[1:20:13] he could fix the situation what can we
[1:20:14] do we've got Dothan we've got soldiers
[1:20:16] but he's trying to humanly trying to
[1:20:19] deliver himself maybe in his mind
[1:20:20] thinking how can how can we get out of
[1:20:22] this situation and how many people
[1:20:24] trying to they trying to establish their
[1:20:26] own righteousness just like here uh Paul
[1:20:29] would say about you know Israel being
[1:20:31] ignorant of God's righteousness and
[1:20:33] going about to establish their own
[1:20:35] righteousness amen have not submitted
[1:20:37] themselves unto the righteousness of God
[1:20:40] and how you know maybe gazi you know he
[1:20:42] would look at those things say how could
[1:20:44] I fix the situation and how many people
[1:20:47] think how can I be righteous before God
[1:20:49] what can I do you see but no your eyes
[1:20:51] have got to come open you need I have
[1:20:53] see this world has either gone to you
[1:20:55] know there's either the very Orthodox
[1:20:57] trict follow the ceremonies follow the
[1:20:59] Traditions you know and you've got
[1:21:02] salvation but then you've gone to the
[1:21:04] opposite end of the spectrum as stay as
[1:21:06] you are God loves you as you are doesn't
[1:21:08] matter how you anything about Holiness
[1:21:10] whatever there's no change of heart just
[1:21:12] be caught up in the music and you're
[1:21:14] saved they're all the world is trying to
[1:21:17] establish its own righteousness but to
[1:21:19] the Bride of Jesus Christ she has no
[1:21:22] righteousness of her own in own self
[1:21:25] there's nothing that we can bring to God
[1:21:27] to Merit anything it's the blood of
[1:21:29] Jesus Christ is our righteousness he is
[1:21:32] our righteousness he's our peace he's
[1:21:33] our Banner he's our defense he's our joy
[1:21:36] he is our King the only Glory we have is
[1:21:38] in him Hallelujah am me but the reason
[1:21:42] we can say that is because is have has
[1:21:43] been applied to our hearts say Lord I
[1:21:45] can see there's nothing in my hands I
[1:21:47] bring simply to Thy Thy cross I cling
[1:21:52] hallelujah praise the Lord now
[1:21:55] the Apostle Paul he said when it pleased
[1:21:58] God to separate me from my mother's womb
[1:22:01] amen and called me by his grace by his
[1:22:03] unmar
[1:22:04] favor now the Apostle Paul could he had
[1:22:07] a very different kind of a life after he
[1:22:09] met the Lord you think he's a man who
[1:22:11] knew the Bible back to front I'm just
[1:22:12] going to leave that picture up there for
[1:22:13] a while he knew the Bible back to front
[1:22:16] but then it's very different when you
[1:22:18] read the Bible when you read it and you
[1:22:20] don't know the author then you read it
[1:22:22] after you meet the author it becomes a
[1:22:24] new book even brother said when the
[1:22:26] seals came open the Bible became a new
[1:22:27] book to him amen and now the same God
[1:22:32] has come into our lives through the
[1:22:33] message of the hour right that we can
[1:22:36] read this and it becomes a new book amen
[1:22:38] that tradition is all taken away amen
[1:22:42] and now he would he would walk in his
[1:22:45] life now he knew God was with him here
[1:22:50] he is he's on the island after the
[1:22:52] Shipwreck now when you only see part of
[1:22:54] the picture you try and work out how you
[1:22:56] can save
[1:22:57] yourself but the Apostle Paul saw the
[1:23:00] Unseen realm God revealed himself all he
[1:23:02] knew was tradition but then I say that
[1:23:05] unseen realm the pillar of fire himself
[1:23:07] came down on the road to Damascus and
[1:23:09] opened his eyes gave him Isa that he
[1:23:11] could see really what was going on and
[1:23:14] then so that same God came and spoke to
[1:23:16] him when he was when there was a big
[1:23:18] tumult going on and there was a big
[1:23:20] fight you know and and and you know he's
[1:23:22] put in prison but God told him you're
[1:23:24] going to be witness in Rome also he was
[1:23:26] a witness he was going to be a witness
[1:23:28] in Rome also now God did not tell him
[1:23:30] the hardships he would go through to get
[1:23:32] to that point God doesn't tell us
[1:23:34] everything we go through right but he
[1:23:36] tells us you're going to get to a
[1:23:37] certain destination what is that
[1:23:39] destination around my Throne amen You're
[1:23:42] Going To Rule and reign with me to he
[1:23:44] that overcometh will sit in my throne
[1:23:46] even as I sat down on my father's Throne
[1:23:48] so there so we it's been revealed to us
[1:23:51] the word has revealed it to us we've got
[1:23:53] a we've got a place to sit that's right
[1:23:55] am amen because God has made us
[1:23:58] Overcomers and how do we become
[1:23:59] Overcomers we take God's word above
[1:24:02] everything else that's how you overcome
[1:24:04] you deny your feelings deny what you
[1:24:06] think deny your opinion deny your
[1:24:07] culture and you take God's word if all
[1:24:09] those things is contrary to God's word
[1:24:11] you take God's word that's how you
[1:24:14] overcome amen praise the Lord there's
[1:24:17] many other aspects to it but that's
[1:24:20] really the main thing you take God at
[1:24:21] his word that's how Jesus overcame in
[1:24:22] the desert he took he said it is has
[1:24:24] written Satan and he overcome it's the
[1:24:27] same thing with us God was showing there
[1:24:29] that the weakest of Christians can take
[1:24:30] God take God at his word and overcome in
[1:24:33] every situation amen so here is the
[1:24:35] Apostle Paul he's he's on his way to
[1:24:37] Rome he wasn't told before he got on the
[1:24:39] ship there' be a shipwreck but you see
[1:24:41] because he could see the Unseen because
[1:24:43] God was real to him when that storm came
[1:24:46] he didn't talk to the captain about how
[1:24:48] best to keep the ship afloat he didn't
[1:24:50] use his own human ability to to to to
[1:24:52] know what can I do to keep the ship
[1:24:53] afloat he went into prayer sure no doubt
[1:24:56] he would have helped when he was asked
[1:24:58] to help on the ship but his main source
[1:25:00] of strength was not his ability it
[1:25:02] wasn't the captain's ability it wasn't
[1:25:04] the sailors wasn't the boat it was the
[1:25:06] Lord God Almighty that told him you're
[1:25:08] going to Rome so his Revelation made him
[1:25:11] see something far greater than the storm
[1:25:13] around him what it made him see the fact
[1:25:16] he's going to Rome friends we're going
[1:25:18] to
[1:25:19] heaven amen we're going to heaven
[1:25:22] Hallelujah because Hallelujah I trust
[1:25:24] the Rapture is a revelation to you I'm
[1:25:26] part of it amen God has been God's grace
[1:25:29] is so great Hallelujah in spite of me
[1:25:33] and my fluster of my Humanity that
[1:25:35] doesn't even come into the equation but
[1:25:37] he saved me so much he's transformed me
[1:25:39] so well that I am in Rapture condition
[1:25:42] right now that if he that if the dead in
[1:25:44] Christ come through those doors my I'm
[1:25:45] going to be changed Hallelujah
[1:25:48] respective of what I'm facing in life
[1:25:50] what I'm going through this holiday
[1:25:51] season whatever more I am in condition
[1:25:54] right now Amen brother says if you
[1:25:56] receed the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:25:58] are Rapture Ready right
[1:26:01] now Hallelujah and then he gets you know
[1:26:04] the Lord tells him that you know the
[1:26:05] ship's going to be lost no one's going
[1:26:06] to but you know that's the only thing
[1:26:07] that'll be lost the people won't be lost
[1:26:09] he gets aore he starts picking up sticks
[1:26:12] helping out making the fire then he you
[1:26:14] know then that there's that snake in the
[1:26:15] bundle bite bites him on the hand
[1:26:18] there'll be things in life that bite you
[1:26:21] you'll be helping he was helping his
[1:26:23] fellow shipwreck or whatever they're
[1:26:25] called I don't know but you know he was
[1:26:26] helping there right he was doing good he
[1:26:28] wasn't being you know self-righteous and
[1:26:31] holy and saying I'm a minister I don't
[1:26:32] need to do anything and help in any way
[1:26:34] he was he was there with everyone in the
[1:26:36] trenches right and you see he got bit by
[1:26:39] a snake there'll be things that bite
[1:26:41] you you that's right I'm sure we've all
[1:26:44] got snake bites I'm not talking about n
[1:26:47] some of us being naturally bitten by
[1:26:48] snakes probably seeing we got Africans
[1:26:51] here and so on but you see we've all
[1:26:53] been spiritually bitten by a
[1:26:54] snake right but there's something in us
[1:26:57] that's greater than whatever the devil's
[1:26:59] fangs can put in US amen why because he
[1:27:03] had a revelation in his heart just like
[1:27:06] Elijah had the Revelation the armies of
[1:27:07] Heaven are around me nothing can happen
[1:27:10] against me without God permitting it
[1:27:12] Hallelujah nothing can get me right so
[1:27:15] so Paul had the Revelation I'm going to
[1:27:17] Rome so the Shipwreck couldn't stop him
[1:27:20] amen the snake couldn't stop he just
[1:27:22] shook it off in the fire yes Hallelujah
[1:27:25] that's why it's so important you begin
[1:27:27] to feel cold and different sometimes
[1:27:29] it's a slow release of a poison of a
[1:27:31] bite you know some people say I feel so
[1:27:34] distant from God what are you feeding on
[1:27:37] you know if you're Doom scrolling you
[1:27:38] won't get Faith from Doom scrolling I
[1:27:41] guarantee you amen if you want a closer
[1:27:42] walk with God put your phone down or
[1:27:46] just read the Bible in the message on it
[1:27:48] or put on spiritual things right cuz I
[1:27:52] cuz I can guarantee you hear will not
[1:27:54] give you Faith stuff won't give you
[1:27:56] Faith it's just a bunch of stuff I me
[1:27:58] BBC CNN Fox News I don't know whatever
[1:28:02] your Instagram that gram won't let you
[1:28:04] won't cause you see man whatever
[1:28:07] platform telegram I don't know all
[1:28:09] whatever whatever it doesn't matter that
[1:28:11] won't give you faith it won't give you
[1:28:13] overcoming power it won't help you in
[1:28:15] your situation all it does is lull you
[1:28:17] off to sleep we're not a bunch of comos
[1:28:20] people around here now our eyes have
[1:28:22] come open I mean we can see Hallelujah
[1:28:24] and we see our source of strength as the
[1:28:26] Lord God
[1:28:28] Almighty Hallelujah so what he do he
[1:28:31] shook he shook the snake off in the fire
[1:28:35] you got a fire burning do you know that
[1:28:37] I trust there's the Holy Ghost fire
[1:28:39] burning in your soul Hallelujah that you
[1:28:42] can take any snake bite you begin to
[1:28:45] think on what God has done for you he
[1:28:46] did it for a purpose he didn't just do
[1:28:48] it for you and just for fun he did it
[1:28:50] for a purpose and I believe everything
[1:28:52] God does for us is has an eternal
[1:28:54] purpose he wants to prove himself to you
[1:28:56] on this side of the veil that when you
[1:28:58] get that side we can praise him now but
[1:29:00] we can praise him there amen that God is
[1:29:02] so good to us that we will never run out
[1:29:04] of things to thank him for I believe
[1:29:06] eternity will be continuous praise sure
[1:29:09] we'll do things you you know there'll be
[1:29:11] things we'll do but there in our hearts
[1:29:13] I just think of it often you know we go
[1:29:14] off and I don't know how it'll be but
[1:29:16] you know we just spent a few million
[1:29:17] years fellowshipping over this side
[1:29:20] Hallelujah and then we're like let's go
[1:29:21] see him and for some reason we choose
[1:29:24] walk cuz we used to do that you know not
[1:29:26] just travel by thought and then you see
[1:29:27] the great Lord and you see him like
[1:29:30] maybe raise his hand and wave you see
[1:29:31] those Nails God had I think he'll have
[1:29:34] those I don't know he had it in his
[1:29:35] glorified body he may have them on that
[1:29:37] side I don't know but I believe there's
[1:29:38] something about we just see him be just
[1:29:40] so that that great wave of thankfulness
[1:29:42] and appreciation and love cuz he is that
[1:29:45] great Fountain of love but I trust you
[1:29:47] know what I feel this morning Hallelujah
[1:29:50] so we're we're not going to Rome we're
[1:29:52] going to Glory so you may be bitten but
[1:29:54] you've got a fire burning you can shake
[1:29:56] it off in there amen and keep walking on
[1:29:58] with God you see we got to realize that
[1:30:01] God see every one of God's children God
[1:30:04] could not take them until God's purpose
[1:30:06] had been finished so he says and I know
[1:30:08] God could not take them he could not
[1:30:10] drown Noah in the flood until the
[1:30:12] purpose of God had been finished he
[1:30:14] could not burn up the Hebrew children
[1:30:15] until the purpose of God had been
[1:30:17] finished he could not kill job with the
[1:30:19] boils and troubles until the purpose of
[1:30:21] God had been finished neither can the
[1:30:22] Lions could the Lions Daniel until God's
[1:30:25] purpose had been finished neither could
[1:30:26] death an old age take Abraham until the
[1:30:29] purpose of God had been finished I said
[1:30:31] neither can the bride of Christ be taken
[1:30:33] out until the purpose of God has been
[1:30:35] finished nothing can stop you if you're
[1:30:39] part of his word nothing can stop you a
[1:30:41] lot of things will try but you are
[1:30:42] unstoppable you're Almighty conqueror
[1:30:45] amen you're you're undefeatable you may
[1:30:47] end up on the carpet sometimes but
[1:30:49] remember the Bible says it's not him
[1:30:50] that falls and him that gets back up you
[1:30:54] may be on the map quite a few times but
[1:30:55] it's not him that wins the battle it's
[1:30:57] him that wins the war that really
[1:31:01] matters I mean the Allies lost a lot of
[1:31:04] lot of battles in World War II but they
[1:31:05] won the
[1:31:06] war they are the
[1:31:09] victors amen what about us I've lost a
[1:31:12] lot of battles but the war it ain't over
[1:31:15] till it's over and it ain't over amen it
[1:31:17] ain't over till it's over and it and I
[1:31:19] tell you it ain't over and neither can
[1:31:21] it take you or no or can take me until
[1:31:24] the purpose of God of our life is
[1:31:26] finished so we gather from their these
[1:31:29] uh their consolation and why does God
[1:31:31] let trouble come God harnesses trouble
[1:31:34] puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey
[1:31:37] him and those troubles bring us into a
[1:31:39] closer fellowship with God Amen I trust
[1:31:43] you have eyes have to see that man I'm
[1:31:45] going through a lot of trouble well God
[1:31:47] wants you really close God wants you
[1:31:49] closer than you've ever imagined in your
[1:31:51] entire life man this is the most some
[1:31:54] year I've ever had God wanted you real
[1:31:55] close this year hallelujah thank you
[1:31:58] Lord thank you Lord for the scars thank
[1:32:00] you for the trouble Lord thank you for
[1:32:01] the trials Lord Praise Lord I've gone
[1:32:04] through the ringer well he wants you
[1:32:05] real
[1:32:06] close he's not angry at you we got to
[1:32:09] realize God's Wrath and anger was poured
[1:32:13] out on our lamb that down
[1:32:15] Calvary the Judgment we should have
[1:32:17] received amen what are we just sing this
[1:32:20] morning you took my place the wrath of
[1:32:22] God had to be satisfied
[1:32:24] and what did he do he took on flesh
[1:32:27] Jehovah Hallelujah hanging between
[1:32:30] heavens and earth Jehovah tooking the
[1:32:32] own judgment of his law upon himself
[1:32:34] that we don't have to taste none of it
[1:32:37] Hallelujah so why are we scared that
[1:32:39] God's angry at us his angers was poured
[1:32:41] out that down
[1:32:45] Calvary
[1:32:48] Hallelujah we walk in fear too
[1:32:51] much we should walk in love walk in
[1:32:54] faith Walk In Joy Hallelujah we got joy
[1:32:57] unspeakable full of Glory walk on those
[1:33:00] things don't walk in fear I'm going to
[1:33:01] put a foot
[1:33:03] wrong just walk in faith amen God will
[1:33:06] direct you if you're Sensi I believe
[1:33:09] you're a sensitive people not in terms
[1:33:10] of emotionally but sensitive to his
[1:33:12] Spirit right that if we're walking in
[1:33:14] the wrong direction you say just turn
[1:33:15] left a little bit turn right a little
[1:33:17] bit stop and turn this way and we'll say
[1:33:19] yes Lord amen so don't be afraid trust
[1:33:23] him can we trust him this year I mean
[1:33:25] next year than more than we ever have I
[1:33:27] believe we can God's conditioning us to
[1:33:29] trust him more and
[1:33:30] more Hallelujah why cuz we can look at
[1:33:33] not just at the trouble but we see the
[1:33:35] armies of Heaven all the God is is
[1:33:36] around us hallelujah brother R says
[1:33:39] deity is not just in heaven but it's in
[1:33:41] you amen praise the
[1:33:45] Lord hallelujah now we're just going to
[1:33:49] wrap up this I feel
[1:33:51] like Abraham had to patiently endure
[1:33:55] after he had patiently endured he he
[1:33:57] obtained the
[1:33:58] promise right so there's going to be
[1:34:00] things we have to endure through but we
[1:34:03] can see the whole picture there's a
[1:34:06] promise right in front of you you got to
[1:34:07] realize you may be there's a lot of Road
[1:34:10] bumps before before a promise you go
[1:34:13] into a car park of a place you want to
[1:34:15] get into normally there's Road bumps hey
[1:34:17] speed bumps yep there's security gates
[1:34:20] of it's a real fancy place there's
[1:34:21] there's obstacles for you to slow down
[1:34:24] but you're about to get there okay how
[1:34:26] many people have ever gone on a plane
[1:34:29] and actually not got on the plane
[1:34:30] because the queue got too big or Customs
[1:34:33] took too long now they're not late now
[1:34:34] they're not going to miss the plane no
[1:34:37] people endure those first world problems
[1:34:39] to get on the plane to get the where
[1:34:41] they want to go to right cuz they're
[1:34:43] looking at the end end
[1:34:45] goal how about us in our everyday life
[1:34:47] you say man I'm going through some
[1:34:48] hardship brother R says that's just to
[1:34:50] test your
[1:34:51] faith so you can see what what in you
[1:34:56] amen like Abraham Abraham didn't really
[1:34:59] know who he was he thought he was a man
[1:35:01] from the childes he was the father of
[1:35:04] Faith right that's who God knew who but
[1:35:07] Abraham had to knew had to know who he
[1:35:10] really was in God same thing with us now
[1:35:12] I'm going to so I said I was going to
[1:35:14] finish I'll actually be true to my word

[1:35:19] 15th verse we um 15th verse we just read

[1:35:28] promise oh I don't know whether we're
[1:35:30] going to get down to the seventh chapter
[1:35:32] um after he patiently endured he

[1:35:35] thing this morning can you set your

[1:36:34] to me just like Paul I'm going to Rome
[1:36:37] I'm not sinking in the Shipwreck I'm not
[1:36:38] dying by this poison I'm going to Rome
[1:36:41] amen should be the same thing with us we
[1:36:44] it's been revealed to us we're going in
[1:36:46] the Rapture what comes and goes before
[1:36:48] that no this body's going to be changed
[1:36:50] we should not fret be anxious about
[1:36:52] nothing amen we're only Fring and
[1:36:55] anxious if we got it in our
[1:36:57] hands faith is Lord I give it to you and
[1:37:00] I actually really do come give it to
[1:37:02] you
[1:37:05] amen now let's let's um let's just come
[1:37:07] down to this point I want to come down
[1:37:09] to this point brother Bram was and and
[1:37:11] I'm going to close with this I really am
[1:37:13] brother Bram was uh speaking of when um
[1:37:15] Congressman Upshaw was healed and he's
[1:37:18] and he and he and he's speaking to him
[1:37:19] about his accident where he's well he's
[1:37:21] speaking he sees in in a vision and and
[1:37:23] then he be and and then he turns and
[1:37:25] then he and then he talks about a a a
[1:37:27] young colored girl who who was operated
[1:37:30] on little colored girl about four four
[1:37:31] years old and it paralyzed her and about
[1:37:34] that time about three times the distance
[1:37:35] of this building a typical old Aunt
[1:37:37] jamaa with them big old black fat cheeks
[1:37:39] let out a scream and she had a stretcher
[1:37:42] there she come that that was my baby uh
[1:37:45] you couldn't keep her away 16 houres
[1:37:46] couldn't stop her she was just knocking
[1:37:48] them left and right with big fat arms
[1:37:50] going I said now stop lady I said have
[1:37:52] you a prayer she said no sir I don't I
[1:37:55] don't have no prayer card I said you
[1:37:57] just come in here that but that's the
[1:37:59] doctor man that operated on my baby 2
[1:38:01] years ago I looked down at the baby the
[1:38:03] intern or the man with the ambulance was
[1:38:05] there I said that's the baby she said
[1:38:07] will my baby get well I said auntie I
[1:38:09] don't know only thing I can do is say
[1:38:12] what I see she said I just pray God
[1:38:15] somehow your faith touched them I never
[1:38:17] seen you and the old Congressman said
[1:38:19] sir will I get well cuz he before this
[1:38:21] he just heard the vision of himself his
[1:38:23] AC and everything I said I can't tell
[1:38:25] you sir I don't know I can only say what
[1:38:27] I see if God is that close to you surely
[1:38:30] he has a purpose of it amen so many
[1:38:33] times we look at things you know we're
[1:38:35] going to think about this for a second
[1:38:37] has God not spoken our questions our
[1:38:41] conversations service after service song
[1:38:44] service after song service things we've
[1:38:46] been talking about in the cards it's
[1:38:48] literally like the whole world is bugged
[1:38:51] whever we go our phones are listening
[1:38:53] and sending and you know that's how the
[1:38:55] preacher gets their material because
[1:38:57] many times people would read this and
[1:38:59] say Lord if only I could be back there
[1:39:01] with brother Bram a vision will be seen
[1:39:03] and it'll be spoken and I'd be well I'd
[1:39:05] say the word of God is still a discerner
[1:39:08] of the thoughts and tense of the heart
[1:39:10] and that same God that was back there
[1:39:13] Hallelujah is the same God that's here
[1:39:15] this morning with us amen so so you got
[1:39:17] to realize if God can speak to your life
[1:39:20] service after service tape after tape
[1:39:23] accurately right where you are there's a
[1:39:25] purpose for it amen and many times you
[1:39:28] it's like this little girl she was
[1:39:30] paralyzed and man can paralyze one
[1:39:32] another it can be trauma it can be hurt
[1:39:34] it can be pain and many times people
[1:39:36] just see those things you know but God
[1:39:39] is not here to keep us paralyzed there
[1:39:42] is a reason that we come into the
[1:39:43] anointing of the word of the hour is
[1:39:45] that our whatever's paralyzed us will be
[1:39:48] taken from us amen so there's a reason
[1:39:50] you got to realize it's the same as a
[1:39:52] vision to me
[1:39:53] as God speaking and preaching about
[1:39:55] someone's life over and over again and
[1:39:59] there's a reason for it there's the
[1:40:00] purpose for it is that person will get
[1:40:02] out of their Affliction that's right and
[1:40:04] begin to walk with God you see Jesus
[1:40:07] would stand
[1:40:09] up Jesus would stand up in uh in
[1:40:12] Nazareth and says the spirit of law is
[1:40:14] upon me uh to preach the gospel to the
[1:40:17] poor has sent me to heal the
[1:40:18] brokenhearted to to preach Deliverance
[1:40:20] to the captives and the recovering the
[1:40:22] sight of the Blind and and set at
[1:40:23] Liberty them that are bruised to preach
[1:40:25] the acceptable year of the Lord that
[1:40:27] anointing that was in the Messiah is a
[1:40:29] new God said all that God pulled into
[1:40:31] Christ he poured into the church right
[1:40:33] so the same anointing the same holy
[1:40:35] ghost that anointed the word there as to
[1:40:37] anoint the word here amen that that that
[1:40:40] we we are part of this now the reason
[1:40:42] I'm saying this is because what are you
[1:40:44] seeing that's right right there's a
[1:40:46] blindness in this age many people just
[1:40:48] see church and families and length of
[1:40:51] service or songs or you know all those
[1:40:54] human things that's right but can we
[1:40:56] look beyond that have we got ISF that we
[1:40:59] can see the Unseen realm where God comes
[1:41:02] down to a meeting I mean and change and
[1:41:04] wants to change Hearts that's why
[1:41:06] brother B said the question well I don't
[1:41:08] know if you'll get well but there's a
[1:41:09] purpose God has done that he's close to
[1:41:11] you if God is that close to you surely
[1:41:14] he has a purpose of it right I'll say if
[1:41:16] God is that close to you there's a
[1:41:18] purpose for it and it's not to leave us
[1:41:20] in our Affliction it's for us to get out
[1:41:22] of our affliction
[1:41:23] am me it's for us to get out where we're
[1:41:25] maybe wounded in our spirit to be healed
[1:41:27] our hearts have been broken because of
[1:41:29] trauma disappointment abuse Whatever It
[1:41:31] Is God can heal that and that's why God
[1:41:34] speaks to our hearts see you got to
[1:41:36] realize you know you sit there and say
[1:41:38] man God spoke to me there's a purpose
[1:41:40] for it God wants you to receive that by
[1:41:42] faith and get up I mean to take God at
[1:41:44] his word and step out of that Affliction
[1:41:46] you say well does those things really
[1:41:48] happen as I said has God not preached
[1:41:50] Our Lives over and over and over again
[1:41:53] amen remember our first camp we had two
[1:41:55] sisters come and their question was God
[1:41:57] if this message is you you better reveal
[1:41:58] it to me now otherwise I'm leaving and
[1:42:01] what and and but what happened is they
[1:42:03] needed isav well where did they see that
[1:42:06] isav in the body operating I me one of
[1:42:10] them asked a question Lord where are you
[1:42:11] and the voice said to her what do you
[1:42:14] see and and she looked around the
[1:42:16] congregation she said I see Jesus yeah
[1:42:18] it changed your life Hallelujah just
[1:42:20] like you know brother Armand you with
[1:42:22] your with your parents right he wasn't a
[1:42:25] gazi he tried the natural way he says
[1:42:27] Lord I got to call you on a conference
[1:42:30] and God came down we all know the
[1:42:31] testimony and then what happened in the
[1:42:33] end of that year God was speaking
[1:42:34] service after service to them dealing
[1:42:36] with them because why they got by a fire
[1:42:40] I mean they got by an anointing
[1:42:42] Hallelujah and Isa was being applied to
[1:42:44] their lives and then how did God seal it
[1:42:46] all up on the last night they were there
[1:42:48] where you know Hera was going to get
[1:42:50] baptized and kba said I'm not going to
[1:42:51] get baptized and you know but God spoke
[1:42:54] to him through a 2-year-old Lilia who
[1:42:56] couldn't even speak where where where
[1:42:58] she got up cuz remember the spirit of
[1:43:00] the Lord is upon us to heal to sit at
[1:43:03] Liberty them that are bruised what is a
[1:43:05] religious prison yeah it's a bruise can
[1:43:08] be but but it's something that contains
[1:43:10] people he was in a religious prison I'm
[1:43:12] sure he wouldn't mind me saying that
[1:43:14] right but he used a little two-year-old
[1:43:15] girl probably not even that age you know
[1:43:17] come up and point to the Bible as I was
[1:43:19] you know reading from Romans chapter 6
[1:43:21] and go to him then take a little toy
[1:43:23] mask and give it to him and he broke
[1:43:24] down he said the Lord told me to obey
[1:43:27] his word and take off the religious mask
[1:43:29] that's right he's a different man and
[1:43:32] how many other testimonies do we have of
[1:43:33] those kind of things what's happening
[1:43:35] because God's anointing is here see
[1:43:37] we're going to look beyond what we see
[1:43:40] and really realize I mean I know you do
[1:43:42] thank you Lord but if we could just real
[1:43:44] lord I just like Lord may your realm
[1:43:46] become more real than what I see here
[1:43:48] than the natural may may Faith be so
[1:43:51] great that all I see is your word your
[1:43:53] promises in spite of whatever I'm going
[1:43:55] through not to put blinkers on but just
[1:43:58] to have everything in perspec of God
[1:43:59] you're more than able and you're present
[1:44:01] sir hallelujah how many other how many
[1:44:04] other um testimonies could we share like
[1:44:07] that but God's still God that's
[1:44:10] right God has brought the message of the
[1:44:13] hour to open our eyes we have eyes sa it
[1:44:15] doesn't make us proud doesn't make us
[1:44:17] arrogant makes us thankful that's what
[1:44:20] say when you realize when the grace of
[1:44:22] God has come into your life yeah you
[1:44:24] think Lord you found me you came looking
[1:44:26] for me I wasn't looking for you I was
[1:44:28] running in the other direction you found
