approach Jesus yes in today's a seeker comes again amen do we have testimonies yes that IV and everyone went to like wolves and when we finished we wanted to take the key out and the key was not in the bag so then we had to go around the golf course looking for the key and he went to one side and I went to the other side and while I was walking I was praying and he was doing the same thing and I say to the Lord okay now I'm doing this praying and I know everyone's doing the same thing and he's praying for the key and I'm prank would be given bearing different sides and I just went through from the one call to the next and I was walking towards the one and I say to the road hang on I've got the spoken word I have it so in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I claim the key at hole number 16 in your name and for your glory when I got there the key was the painting to the ground anyone else I just my side of the story so I took the back nine which is the more difficult one because there was sheep around and Magpies and sheep dung and I've got a black key that looks like sheep dung so it was difficult for me to find the key but my lesson out of that and I'm very glad Lonnie got the key I was walking anything and thought if I see the key at T number five and it's there and it's shining I know the keys there but I'm still here and there's no way I can just time travel all of a sudden I'm at the key I still need to walk I still need to get there so I can see where I'm going I can see that's my that's my goal that's what I want this is what I'm living for for this moment but I still need to walk there so through the sheep dung and the sheep in the Lambs I need to get there but I know that that is it that's it period in a me [Applause] all right I thought I'd better share this because I gave you part one of the trial and the testimony so I gave you part one but I give you better give you part two remember when I shared how the Lord showed me how I put a wall up and then I didn't let my husband in and I let him in and it's changed our marriage it has a revolutionize our marriage but there was something I did which made the trial prolong oh it was good but it uh so when I let Isaac in he was in my heart and and I yeah he I think I replaced him with Christ because Christ came into my heart first right and I've never let a person come into my heart then he came into my heart and then he became exalted in my heart first place and that's where the trouble started begin I started getting um I started expecting him to give me the love of Christ at Ikes that only Christ can give you and um and so when he wasn't giving me that you know when you get into your prayer closet and you just feel so special in the Lord Oh you know and he just there's just something that Christ that human beings cannot do and so then so when he wasn't giving me that that love like only Christ can I was getting a bit snippy a Isaac it was becoming like quite regular whoo it was awful and it was actually even getting like every three days and then I was like I was like sniffy and it was yeah Isaac can testify was really bad but um and then so I had enough it happened over a few months a like it was just getting worse and worse and so I just came to the Lord and I said oh I don't know what's going on you know can you help me and you just get down on your knees and then the and then the Lord really showed me oh there was lots of things ah ha ha ha um Wednesday night brother Ben preached about all these things and I thought because I was on my knees praying praying praying and I thought he was going to point the finger at other other you know other people and that was that I was I was right you know there was nothing wrong with me but then he spoke the word and man he just pinpointed four points and the Lord just shone his light boom this is this is what's in you and then I just I've always been afraid of the Lord rebuking me and showing me things in me because I I don't like to disappoint him but then after that I was like Oh Lord forgive me you know I don't want those things and I'm always so good because look Satan tried to condemn me and say oh no you now you're not filled with the Holy Ghost and everything else but then I got a phone call the next day from a sister who prayed for me and then saw you know saw the Lord with me and it was amazing and then after that I realized I did not put Christ in his rightful place in my heart there's room for lots of people you know room for my husband and there but he remains first place he remains king and the only place he wants in he's a jealous God is king supreme and so Oh once I put him in his rightful place my marriage has just like I thought it revolutionized but man it just gets better and better and bitter because now I've got Christ as my king in my husband's in my heart and all yeah so that's that's part two and I don't think that well I mean there might be other parts but that was that was - that part praise the Lord [Music] [Applause] know what all right it's standing now the next song was shade of a few weeks ago on our what does that group and if you know it sing

mean great to have great Dave Susanna and and and Stephanie here god bless you good to have you here hey man god bless you all he wasn't even feeling good today amen let's go - can I Drive this so just as you're turning so you notice we move the bookcase out there it's all free to a good home please take it all give it out it's not there to sit on a shelf it's not there just as a decoration so please feel free just take it yeah for whatever you see fit to use it for and also we're having a church Thanksgiving dinner or evening afternoon on the last week last Saturday of November so I think it's the 25th of November 26 and Movember so if you haven't received your invitation your invitations on the front desk is everyone's invited we're gonna have a wonderful time I mean we've got a lot to be thankful for now sees here in Isaiah 26 and 3 it says it says if thou will keep Herman so thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts us in thee I mean so this is if your mind has stayed on the Lord he will keep you in perfect peace right because he trusts us in thee and then we're going to Hebrews chapter 9 and verse we're gonna read down a bit of a portion of Scripture here in Hebrews chapter 9 and you may think these are two very different kind of scriptures but I want to continue on from Wednesday if I may seize here now so Hebrews 9 and 13 it says for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify earth to pure fly purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God well your next one and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of his death thereby means was death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament they which are called might receive the promise of it of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also be necessary necessity be the death of the testator for a testament as as a force after men are dead otherwise that have it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with the water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you Amy may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning so I want to continue just a thought about how the blood hasn't joined us to the promise we see here and we see here in Hebrews chapter 9 that Moses after he after he gave the word that he received on mount sinai to the people that he sprinkles the the book the law and he sprinkles the people with the same blood joining the law to the people and as I said on Wednesday just a quick review the law actually had power in it it wasn't just to you know if the people kept the law now we understand the law was a policeman that just put the people in jail but Jesus Christ sets us free but also there was a power in that law because there was a promise in the law one will chase a thousand two will chase ten thousand that there was a power in the law that the people could dwell in their land drive out the enemies and have peace with God walking among them that was really the real purpose of the law that God would place his people in their inheritance and God would be among them even though I was under the blood of bulls and goats even though God could not dwell in his people he couldn't change the hydrous people but that was there was a power in the law and that's just under the blood of bulls and goats I mean so Shamgar under the blood of bulls and goats killed what six to eight hundred eight hundred Philistines because he was under the blood of bulls and goats but the Prophet says he knew he was a son of Abraham and that was enough I mean so he knew he was standing in his inheritance he was a son of Abraham he was circumcised to the promise he was out of the blood of bulls and goats and that was enough and he took us on ox cart and he killed however many hundred of the enemy soldiers because there was power on the law I mean so there's so the promise now we are not living under the law if we're dead we're free from the law if we really did in Christ we are free from the law so we're not under that but it goes to show now that affects just under the blood of animals how much more the power that is and that is in the Covenant under the blood of God's own son Jesus Christ hallelujah so now God wants to do something for us I'll be thinking a lot about sonship now we're gonna read a few things but there was power in the law you understand under the blood of bulls and goats David took the whole land under the blood of bulls and goats no man could stand before Samuel all the days of his life you got to read the Old Testament characters Gideon under the blood of bulls and goats you know with 300 men defeated the people of the east and the Midianites and all those people under the blood of bulls and goats under the blood of bulls and goats Moses brought the children of Israel out of Egypt into the Promised Land and this is under the blood of natural animals and he had a creative power he could speak amen hallelujah let there be flood frogs or flies or whatever and and they they appeared amen now how much more now that was a son under the blood of bulls and goats how much more a son or daughter of God that's under the blood of Jesus Christ ending in their position I mean there's nothing they can stand before the Bride of Christ there's nothing that can stand before you you got to understand this no weapon because of what he has made you to be no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper they means that he joined so now we ever promised you know we're singing that song that was it Declan wrote yo will sing of us peace sing of us great love and it season in revelations chapter 5 when the lamb takes the book they sang in you song I mean so to me oh that's just me when I hear that song will sing I mean I'll sing my new song because by his blooder birrabeen redeem back to god and he's taking my inheritance he's looser seals off it and now he says this is what belongs to you this is what belongs to you I'm going to make sure you receive it I mean because we read about the death of a you know for a testament there's no force after men are dead otherwise there's no strength at all while the testator liveth so that the person who gives the inheritance normally has to die first for them for the people to receive it but then Jesus didn't just die to give us the inheritance but he's a life forever more to make sure you receive yer inheritance amen and our inheritance is our position in Christ I mean that there would be a people upon the earth that would come to their placing in the body they would come to their sonship now when it speaks about sons of God it also speaks about daughters of God it's a position in Christ I mean so just because it doesn't say daughters doesn't mean it's only men there no it's not that way it's a now our Lord Jesus is here in this hour that we would come to our adoption we would come to our placing hallelujah this is this is why the book came open that's why the seals were open that's why the lamb stepped forth I'm going to make sure my children come to their place that they no longer downtrodden and tossed to and fro and you know bound by bound by personality you know I was praying very much last night Lord Mayor may I walk with you not be biased by our upbringing or by our culture or by our personality because brother Brown says brother Graham says that that someone is very scholarly if they don't keep it under prayer they'll become dogmatic and starchy and those who are very emotional people of the don't keep it under prayer dug off you're into wild things he doesn't use the word while things with usual counsel Bobby says that our personalities if we don't keep it unto prayer will make us go certain ways I'm like Lord I don't want my walk with you to be dictated to by this thing I want to be dictated to by the Holy Ghost and only the Holy Ghost because my culture will make me lean a certain way my upper who make me lean a certain way and do certain things and look at life a certain way but who says it's right who says it's right so we got a lay aside lay aside our upbringing meaning things are good in our upbringing but it's the bad things we're gonna say Lord Lord you go through and take out everything that's not of you and that's her and as same with our personality because you've got a maybe your biggest enemy as yourself and the devil will take your carnal nature and your whisper in your ear and all sound so good and you're going off on some tantrum someplace at all because you're actually being led by your carnal nature yet you could have quotes and scriptures to back up your position I mean but who says it's right so we're gonna be very careful I you know Lord I want to walk with you according to what you want I don't want my bias my by human bias is always wrong mine is very wrong I'll be the first one to admit that one now he sees in John one and one he sees in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and it would just drop down to verse 11 he says he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him whose received him in this day whose received our Lord Jesus is up as as Lord and personal Savior so not just Savior but Lord Lord means your king as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God member those daughters as well that's just not sons right I mean that's a position even to them that believe on his name I love that song name above all names here is the name above all names I mean not the name of some denomination or some church or the name above all names of the name of Jesus Christ amen in this power in that name this life in that name is redemption in that name this healing in that name there's identity in that name everything you meet overs in the name of Jesus Christ he is wonderful he's the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace amen if he has a feast the Prince of Peace he'll give us subjects peace hallelujah he'll give us bride peace my peace I give you notice the world gifts but you got to keep your mind state on him because we're on a journey remember our journey from a slave to the throne I mean we're a journey from a slave being beaten by the devil until finally we are joint heirs with Christ I made it remember those who came out of Egypt under the blood they were God wanted to place them in the land but everything they need of was in that lamb and that blood that token blood they walked out of everything Nieto was there hallelujah those had to walk and receive it a mentor one day one day one day no the scripture says will come to it now we are the sons of God today amen which are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh wasn't your will I just you know I love it how God is sovereign he chooses who he will he raises up who he will he reveals himself to he will he hardeneth who he will you know he's sovereign and to me that takes any any of my ability out of the equation completely because it was God's sovereign choosing I choose this one I can reveal myself to this way this one's going to know me I'm going to declare my name to that person and they will meet me and I'll be their God and they leave our child I mean that is God that is God's sovereign choosing and to me I'm so thankful every day you chose me don't need to become Commodore but I do this and this with us no he chose me and in my life is a reflection of that Thanksgiving they should be more a means to that don't just go quiet on me aren't you thankful nor of the will of man but of God and God's will is supreme nothing can stop his will c'mon hundred he can try and stop it but at the end of the day the Israelites possessed the whole land the devil's world was I'm going to stop them and he said Balaam and he did all kinds of things that he and he fortify and he anointed the people in the cities you know Jericho you know why were the fortification so strong because here's God speaking to a son Abraham your seed is going to sojourn in a strange land for hundred years they're going to be afflicted but I'm going to bring them back to this place under a mighty hand the devil's taking notes this is what his promise is gonna be I'm gonna stop this promise so he fortified the cities you know he inspired the people to train their warriors and do all kinds of things did it stop them no it didn't stop then stop God's promise then stop God's will God's will is you're gonna be in the land and they're in the land and God's will for us is you're going to receive your inheritance I mean everything God has for you will receive you're just going to say be it unto me according to thy word that should be our response for everything be it unto me according to thy word hallelujah you get a go to rapture be it unto me according to thy word I've sent you the shout the message of the shop be it unto me according to thy word amen you'll be the head and not the tail be it unto me according to thy word I mean you're more than a conqueror through him that loved you be it unto me according to thy word wing goes through many things of those things hallelujah but you've got to say Lord be it unto thee according to thy word because that's that's your promise I mean the Bible is not a storybook that's a it's a it's a covenant with you Laurie but we see Jesus no but we see Jesus who's made a little lower than the Angels God became a man for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man he took my place he took my place been but now if he is the supreme one he's the supreme one he is the head of the church he's the head of the body he is the husband he's the king he's the sacrifice he's the Lamb he's our all and all so if he's how old and old who should our eyes be upon your pulse is looking unto Jesus not looking under yourself with your brother - your sister or whatever more looking unto Jesus I'm not interested in what other people do now don't put me wrong we should pray for one another love one another but ultimately I'm not worried about what other people doing I'm looking at him because what you look at you will become you what you look at you will become if you look at each other you'll become like each other but if you look at him you'll become him so who are you looking at who are you looking at we're not mean to be a bunch of peacocks strutting around thinking we're the bee's knees who are you looking at I didn't say that as a joke but you got to think about it I'm looking under Jesus I'm looking under him against his word for became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings they say that this is his purpose and bringing many sons unto glory so here's a call that's gone out yeah that's why God and I've been thinking about this we think about seals we think about horse riders sometimes we think about tribulation the lamb opening the book is more than those things the lamb opening the book is now saying I'm gonna bring you unto glory amen I'm gonna I'm gonna bring you to your position because remember a lot of what Paul was saying in the first age was prophecy they did not fully possess the promise in their day they didn't fully you see the Ephesians the Ephesian you know the word Ephesians means aimed at but relaxed so they aimed at the high call in Christ but because the anointing of the aged they relaxed because they had to because the church had to go eventually down into the Dark Ages and die right and go underground so they aimed at it but then they relaxed so what many things Paul is saying is prophecy of this day amen because this book is a book of prophecy all the scripture actually in the Bible pertains to today amen it's not all it's not just history I mean so now he's saying now that there will be a people because remember when we come to our position then the rapture will go when the bride around the world comes to her position then the rapture will go I mean because God ever there was a man and a woman and a garden in the beginning husband and wife and the garden in the beginning and through the Old Testament God was molding and shaping rebuilding the man then here was Jesus Christ the fullness of God here Bodley in flesh here's the man the second Adam and he demonstrated everything that the first Adam did I mean before the fall he had power over nature you know we were having fellowship a brother ed Zod was at Monday talking about nature and I was thinking this should know there's a fear between us and us in nature you know it doesn't matter what what creature maybe is a fear but it's not meant to be that way we mean to be Adams fallen races meet to be the gods of the earth and I mean to be our subjects now in Eden everything was was controlled by divine love there's no fear there's no separation between between man and beast in terms of you could call whatever animal they be no fear the biggest lion the biggest whatever was there the biggest scariest whatever you know you could just call it come here would come brother man talks about cheetah the lion I mean cheetah the lion and whatever and the tiger and the you know come here and they scratch him under the chin and they you know there's no fear it's not meant to be but now this fear between us and beasts it's not meant to be that way there's a gulf now there's a gulf of fear and his brother Bear I was thinking about this last night he's standing in Colorado and a blizzard comes through and he's about any tells him run because it's forecast to happen he tells everyone he says now as soon as the first snowflakes begin to fall you head back back back to base as fast as you can because it'll be a blizzard you won't be able to see so begins that come through it's just white and then he's walking back towards can be hears a voice behind him you know I am I am yo lo God Almighty whatever he says will you come and walk with me hey sis Lord is at uni turns round he walks back into the storm to walk with God and then and then the Lord says just speak who knows the story you know the story he says speak and whatever you say will be he says storm you go back we'll have three or four days of perfect weather we're going to finish the hunt and it was a whiteout blizzard in a few moments it was just perfect blue sky and then now out of the bush has come some deer and they come up to him now to me know what is this I was thinking last night I singing I don't know if animals do but do they have a memory because things that happen to our forebears affect us then they know things that happen to them affect us somehow it's passed down singing to animals now this is just all the fellowship this is just me so you can just forget this button remember a next part later on but I was singing do this nature have a memory of what it was like to be governed by Adam does it have a memory see come these deer up he could have shot them and with a visually saying Adam is that you because the reader of the scripture all of creation is groaning into the manifestation sons of God so did they come out of those bushes saying is that you is that our king that we've been waiting all of nature's groaning and it's waiting for the manifestation or the revealing of the sons of God hallelujah that's why they came out because here was here was a redeemed son in his position and he had control over nature and that's what nature's waiting for waiting for you to come to its position you to come to your position so he would bring many sons unto glory he had take us I'm so glad he took us and you glad he found you and wherever you were doesn't matter if you're raised in church raised whatever he's got to become real to you you've got to recognize you jesus paid it all in all to him I owe hallelujah doesn't matter what other what what do you what else makes of it amen oh I'll cherish the old rugged cross hallelujah now so he that sanctifies a neighbor who has sanctified all of one for which cause he's not ashamed to call them brethren saying I'll declare thy name unto my brethren the mister Church will I sing praise unto thee he's not ashamed to call you part of the family and again I'll put my trust in him and again behold I am the children with God has given me for as much seen as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage hallelujah it is a deliverance amen where that's why people get religious they get scared what happens when you die and they you know I was talking to a brother last weekend and his his his father he wasn't a believer but his father had a had a Bible in a Koran that he read every night because you want to make sure if one's wrong then you'll then you'll get the right one and if one's right you know the other one's wrong he want to cover both bases now that's sad sad way to be we don't have to be that way but people people pick up all kinds of different religion because they're afraid what's going to happen when my threescore and ten are done but Jesus came to deliver us from that fear we shouldn't have a fear of death if it ends now glory death is just brother Ron Spencer said death is just a travel bus to get us to where we really want to go I don't want to stay in this place do you want to stay in this place hallelujah so this is what Jesus God became a man to redeem us back to himself because only he could do it now let's go to Romans chapter eight there's going to be a better reading of them all then we'll go from there all nature is waiting this is our promise you know that it is full it says now for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear a man you should say yes that's me we don't we shouldn't be living in fear is this do I please him do I not please them it should be Lord I love you my life is motivated by divine love amen my life is the way I love everything I do is out of love it's not out of anything else it's Lord I love thee I will serve thee because I love thee yes amen but ye have received the spirit of adoption man member adoption in the and the Bible is not as a placing of a child in the family that their name on the check is as good as the father's name right so you have received the spirit of adoption where you cry Abba Father all my father my father amen do you know that he do you know that you came from him I mean do you know who your father really is maybe that's why when God when he placed man upon the earth and the book of Genesis when man begins to come into the picture says and the Lord God said and this that's the almighty one who who reveals himself whereas relationship hallelujah and that's why and that's God's whole purpose that's why he puts you upon the earth as I'm going to declare myself to my children I mean I'm going to make myself known to them I'm going to walk with them I'm going to have a relationship with them I'm going to bring them into a position helllooo that their joint is with me hallelujah I'm glad it's that way I mean don't fall asleep on me people I mean it's glorious this is part of the promise of this age I mean it's why the seventh seal came up and the seals are open and then the mighty angel descended I mean cuz he was an open book because he wants you to be placed in your position as a son I mean that's why it is it's not a doctrine or just a mental understanding I mean the Spirit of God moved Peleliu just like in Genesis when the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters darkness cover the deep and there was a separation of darkness and light I mean the land came forth because the seats were their holiness seed there and he says let there be light and the light appeared I mean let the seed bring forth after its kind hallelujah saw the oak tree grew into an oak tree I mean the pumpkin grew into a pumpkin that then Elan became a dandelion the Kari became a Kari boohoo the cow became it for her to cower whatever tree what a puddle or vegetation it came forth hallelujah to their position what they meant to be and is the same thing with you and I oh my I love the Spirit of God because what he does is he is he broods over us because he wants to bring out what's really the real you he wants to bring out what you really mean to me that's like David he's a little shepherd boy you know he's looking after his father's sheep guys training him to even there and then and then the prophet Samuel comes to his father's house because God's told him there's a king I have a king and Jesse's house David's just Davis just you know gets up in the morning his dad says now take the Sheep go to this back paddock or do whatever yes dad he just goes off he comes back he's a little boy you know he plays like a little boy he thinks like a little boy you know he's just a normal child but Entenmann's to be a king I mean not but not out of his ambition it's not our ambition I mean it's not out of his he doesn't dream of all one day I'll live there and well you know I'm going to retake Jerusalem I'm gonna make it my capital I'm gonna be the king and you know God is going to say I'm a man after my own you know I'm a man after his own heart and this is he's not having these kind of ideas being a shepherd boy but animus to is to be a king and then a vindicated prophet comes comes to his father's house takes the Horn of the anointing oil pours it out upon the upon the vessel pulls out upon God's King hallelujah and it says from that day the Spirit of God was with him from that day on amen and then so it goes from that place maybe God's now leading him leading from being a shepherd boy to being the king of Israel hallelujah and so now it's the same thing with you it is the same thing with you God seemed to vindicate a prophet in this hour I mean with a word with an anointing because his anointing in the world I mean it was pulled out the whole Horn of the anointing almost pulled out I mean upon this age hallelujah and the anointing fell upon you amen you begin to realize I'm a son and daughter of the king hallelujah I'm not mean to be just a little shepherd boy someplace or walking around in this life and doing whatever but I've got a higher calling and that's why God calls you that's why you feel something pulling your heart I mean it's because God is speaking to you God is drawing you holy because he doesn't want you just to beat Joe Bloggs on the street he wants you to walk the streets of gold hallelujah that is truth and David now remember David this is how David worked he didn't operators now how can I become king he didn't begin to strategize and plan things he says the Lord is before me he followed he followed the Lord and he didn't he didn't try and plan now how can I have a coup and take out say I'm sold on all these things he said God will take care of my enemies God will take care of him and he just walked with God because he knew at the right time in the right season he'll be sitting on the throne when he is ready he'll be on the throne and it's all of the being a fugitive in his own country and being on the run from Saul and going down to the Philistines and everything he did was training amen because God had to train him do you trust me in the good times do you trust me in the bad time you trust me when you think things are secure you trust me when you have to be ran off your own thrown by your son do you trust me it's got to be the same thing with you do you trust him in the good times do you trust him in the bad times do you trust him when you think what's going to happen to me hallelujah you trust him because that's that's that's what God's sons and daughters that's what he wants them to be like I mean brother Mary speaks of the tutor raising the child and and and and the tutor begins the Lederman see is now we're going to go over this he'll go this way you gonna come with me yeah I'll come with you hey sure it's dangerous now as long as you got me by the hand as long as you got me by the hand shooter I'll be all right hallelujah it's got to be the same thing with you I mean there's there's dark places and hot places and places where you think I'll never survive this but as long as you know I want my hand to be in his hand I don't want to be holding his hand I want him to be holding my hand so when you hold a little child's hand because my grip is weak but his grip you can't amen it just goes beyond the scale of strength hallelujah so you're going to have Lord have my hand in your hand because you're leading me for a reason glory it's a David operate that's how David operated he didn't plan how am I gonna do this this and this and this he just walked with God he knew he was gonna be anointed king why did God send elijah why did he send in Eleazar call upon the earth I'm looking for a bride I'm looking for the feminist part of me hallelujah I'm looking for me in feminine form amen go find her hallelujah he sends Eliezer to the earth and they're still there and the Holy Spirit I mean the vessel was taken away but the Holy Spirit still here panting a bride for the son hallelujah and you just happen to find yourself you know it's like you know like Rebecca who knows get it yeah you know the story I'm going off my notes but here we are here's Rebecca she's just walking to the well it's just another day go to the well Here I am you know I don't know what season it was anyway she's just doing and then she sees a man with some camels and something and then and then he says can you can you draw me a drink from the water you know from the world and something enter says yes I will enter water your camels she has no idea here's a man has been sent and the master of this man said my angel will go before you and will prepare the heart of the damsel and then and then before he gets to the city he prays Lord made the one who comes out and offers me drinking waters my camels may she be the one and so now she has no idea this is all going on she's just she's just living life it's an everyday kind of thing going on and then and then and then early ages of to her father's house and then Eleazar sits down with with her father and the family and begins to relay you tell them all the supernatural things and why he's come and then she begins to realize I fulfilled I fulfilled the prayer hallelujah my heart's being prepared even before he came God sent his angel to me hallelujah and I responded and I've sinned Oh God hallelujah and it's like us I don't know how you stumbled into this message I don't know how you did it it was just everyday kind of thing maybe spoke to someone I don't know any now and then and in the enormity the reality really sets in this is the voice of God to this generation and it was five it was ten to find a bride is a bridegroom who wants to be united to a bride hallelujah and then you begin to realize I'm her hallelujah you are she does that mean something to you I sure a trust it does hallelujah now yes are you were still in Romans chapter eight so now you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father hallelujah that means the world to me I know who my father is nothing about my natural father I know who my real father is hallelujah and all of his children will be there all everyall the father has given me will come to me and all that comes we are no wise cast out amen so don't worry about well am i or am I not just come to him lord I come to you hallelujah remember if there's a pull in your heart it's because he wants you to come hallelujah and he put that in there you didn't put that in there you didn't desire he put something in you I must come I'm asking of my life I must serve this Jesus hallelujah out of love you know you know what I mean I'm just I'm just going to preach my testimony for a little bit but yeah there's that bird there's something in you and you get sick of what life really are there's more to life than us and you're not happy with the status quo of life oh god you get stirred up and then he finds you it's his doing I mean and if children to the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then where is is of God jointly is with Christ if so be we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so he's saying now who knows who their daddy is hallelujah amen then that means now where is we fool it everything he received amen and we're not just is we're joint is that means that means everything that he received we receive hallelujah just like I heard someone say about Muhammad Ali and as and as and his wife Muhammad Ali he trained he went into the ring he trained he fought he comes his wife maybe sits on the front row watches the belt you know but then the paycheck comes and she receives it everything he earned in the fight although everything he had to go through she just receives it she didn't have to go into the ring she didn't have to train she'd never do all those things but she received the check hallelujah jesus paid it off he went to Calvary on our behalf I mean when he was on the cross you're on his mind a many purchased our salvation and we received the check hallelujah we receive eternal life glory to God they made so if we suffer with him we're bearing his reproach that we may be also be glorified together for I reckon that our sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth now this word creature actually means creation for the earnest expectation of the creation waitis for the manifestation of the sons of God now this word manifestation means revealing that's like within David there was a king that King had to be revealed right it's the same thing yo with with any of the believers down through there was a revealing of what they mean to live out just like Peter James and John and a sailboat they weren't meant to stay in the sailboat they were just to say fishermen and then was apostles hallelujah and then was the you know you know and then was you like Peter he had the keys of the kingdom that was what was in them the woman at the well in here was to be a daughter of God hallelujah she wasn't mean to be just the woman at the well Liam wasn't mean to be just Legion with a thousand odd Devils in him that wasn't there had to be a rare revealing what was really in them that's what Jesus came in their way Tolu yeah just like the Apostle Paul he wasn't mean to be he wasn't mean to be a Pharisee he was mean to be the Apostle the first church age messenger and that's the same thing with you I want to labor on this because you got to really say your look at yourself saying Who am I really what am I really am I am i say bought at a certain place and you know a certain family in certain culture is that who I really am no Amen you say some of you can say glory to God I don't know but you should recognize I'm not just I'm a son or daughter of the king that's who I really am but there has to be a revealing I mean the life that's in you has to come forth but it has to be anointed it has to come alive how lujah and then once it does you can't stop it you can't stop it hallelujah I'm glad you can't stop it amen because even if you fight against it God will get you into a place where you'll say now then your head then you have to say now you have my attention now I give up and I wouldn't fight against God and say God I quit you take over for the creature was also subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who subjected the same in hopes that's when Adam four-footed has rights to save Eve because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God before we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to work the redemption of our body our trust is a groaning I trust is a groaning in you I wanna I want to take off this thing put on an eternal body I mean I want to be I don't want to stay in this place you know the whole world has gone through birth pains the whole world is travailing brother band preacher swim and birth pains and he said the first for first world war was a birth pain and in the second world war was another birth pain and that birth pain was far greater than the first because they get stronger and stronger amen and then now there's been a it's been a season now where God held back the third birth pain this is just me because this elected ones had to come in the 144,000 had to be in Israel hallelujah and that's why God is long-suffering not willing that any would Pierce but all would come to repentance that's because he's going to hold back the destruction I mean to make sure all of his children are gathered to the gana hallelujah glory that's why we're still here that's why we're still here and then the third birth pain will be yeah the tribulation it'll be far worse every far worse than anything this world has ever seen it will be but for those who are bidden to come and have accepted the invitation they'll be on the streets of gold I mean they'll be in a wedding supper of the Lamb hallelujah but the world that's why this world is falling apart that's why nature's falling apart I mean society is falling apart is because this world has to give way to birth a new world hallelujah and we we friends are on our way out of here amen he say well you've said that for about I bet I believed that for 10 years and I believe it more now than when I first believed I mean the promise is much closer now than when we first believed hallelujah the scripture is all coming around for a birth pain hallelujah I'm not too worried about it though remember the tribulation is a purging time he God purges nature he purges the foolish virgin he purges the world purges as well everything it's a purging and the Great Tribulation but if Jesus took out took our punishment if he paid it all haloo if he took our judgment we don't need a purging I mean the bride doesn't need to go through the tribulation to be purged I mean because she's received the fullness of the sacrifice she's received the fullness of the blood yes you should say he's talking about me Jesus he's talking about me I mean so we don't need to go through the Great Tribulation because jesus paid it all we don't need a purging when I trust we're not the foolish virgin we have oil in our lamps I mean all we care about us him so we are groaning there's something within us that would have the waiting for the adoption there's the final part of the adoption is the redemption of our body where our bodies are changed hallelujah but all of creation is groaning travailing a pain together until now it's waiting for the revealing of the sons of God I mean because when when the sons of God come to deposition and sons and daughters of God come to their position then the rapture will go and God is going to show the devil this is what my this is what Calvary does they meant because we need to talk about the effects of Calvary it's not just enough talking about about God dying on the cross for us but you're gonna say what did that achieve what did that achieve amen and you got to say what did it achieve it achieved a total cleansing of a people I mean a wiping of this Sunday so the nature could be changed that they would receive his nature hallelujah that his life would now operate in a people and live through live through them amen it's no longer I that liveth but Christ liveth in me that's the effects that's the purpose of Calvary as a people would be raised up hallelujah the devil would be under their feet I mean that every every work of the enemy would be trodden upon by them and they would be they would be victorious in every walk of life that's what Calvary's meant to achieve they meant Calvary's meant to achieve this no longer me and my nature is his nature then we become partakers of divine nature hallelujah that the seven virtues that Peter speaks about a built in our life and we're kept with divine love I mean that divine love is here I'm in the capstone is here I mean in the capstone as the intelligence as the head of the body hallelujah and so now in this age we have the mind of Christ amen do we not it's no longer me thinking it's his thoughts I mean it's not my ideas it's his ideas it's not my purpose that's his purpose if you have the mind of Christ I mean and we have the bride has the mind of Christ we've been kept by divine love Allu you I believe it I believe you say yes Lord that's me remember what are you looking at because what you look at you will become are you looking at Jesus Christ the word or you're looking at something else I mean now I should be single we should be beholding one thing because what you behold you will become amen it was a guy this is when I was at boarding school there's a there's a guy in my dorm he was there my friend but I thought he was cool and I started to dress like him I started to try and talk like him because I was beholding something didn't do me any good but there's always something that catches our imagination and we say I want to be like him I wanted to be like Danny Morrison whoever remembers Danny Marsh and the fast bowler I want to ball like him I want to run like came up to the wicket go right over the empire just like he did nearly taking off the guy's ear every time we Bowl I know I want to be exactly like him cuz it captured my imagination and that's what I was beholding they meant we say that's just being a little kid that's the same thing being an adult but sometimes it's more deceptive because of childish ways it's hard on its sleeve many times and you can do they just transparent but an adult when they get older when people get older they can hide what they really are so what are you beholding I want to behold him because when we see him we shall be like him I wonder if I have that in he because it speaks about the appearing yeah here it is here behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us hallelujah now we should be called the sons of God wherefore the world knows us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God now not all one day one day one day no now well one day when I get mature my walk no now you are my girls are my daughters soon as I born there a daughter amen of whatever I have which is not you know but they work.they I don't have to wait well now you have to become of age than you my daughter know they always my daughters but there's a life in them they're growing you know maturing they couldn't eat you know they couldn't eat sold food then they learned how to eat solid food they couldn't crawl then they learned how to crawl they couldn't walk with it alone how to work Oh walk they couldn't run then they learned how to run I mean they couldn't draw then they're learning how to draw they couldn't write now they're learning how to write they couldn't read now they're learning how to read because there's a growth is a life that's growing as the same thing with us we can just be a new bulb newborn babe in Christ now you are a son of God now you are I mean as soon as you're burst into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost remember us were sons though I mean because we are sons he said for those Holy Spirit sees in Galatians right but then now God God has to anoint your life to bring forth the real you but then there's a life in you that begins to mature and grow as long as there's a maturity and a growth just keep walking now this is what you think is your maturity to growth we're gonna look back a year ago and what are you now are you more like Kemeny less like him or are you standing still if you're standing still or being less like him you say Lord I want to surrender I meant but if you're being more like him he said Lord continue working beloved now we are the sons of God it shall not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for he we will shall see him as he is now this is just an fellowship but brother brother Bram talks about there's a difference between the appearing and the coming of Christ and he spoke about when the Son of Man is being revealed that is the appearing it's also part of the coming but he said though the Holy Ghost is now appearing among us amen so but we know when he shall appear he's appeared in this last age he walks among us it's not just recorded on tape he walks among us now that same God walks among us Amen is that is it ok with everyone is the difference between the appearing and the coming right answer now he is it he is appearing among us he's also started as coming but it's coming hasn't finished because I'm still in this body and the dead in Christ are having arisen yet I'm looking for them they meant but God will get us ready if you're a prisoner to him God will get you ready amen that when the dead in Christ rise you will see them he say well I've never seen a real believer you know that's died they'll make sure you know who they hear just me amen so he's so when when he shall appear we shall be like him so now he's appearing among us why is he appear among us as to mold us and shape us that we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is there's no Creed's and dogmas anymore we're not looking through a glass darkly anymore it's not smoke and mirrors and I think and I think and maybe and what does this group of scholars say and what does this group of scholars say what does this group of scholars say God seem to vindicate a prophet that we would know and God over vindicated it that we know exactly the person of God because this message is a person this is Jesus being revealed amen so when he shall appear we shall be like him that's why I trust you can see I trust you look at your members character he's looking for character brother Brahim said I don't have the quote obviously is the kingdom of God as a nature it's a nature the kingdom of God is a nature what does that mean it says it's a it's a it's a character ristic my characteristic young but Jesus had the nature of God because he was God the fruits of the spirit are spoken about I mean and when that comes into you know when his life comes into you it will produce that character will produce that nature right and so he's here to make us like him he has appeared and we'll see him as he is we do see him as he is this is not mental gymnastics you know there's still people that debate is he 3 2 or 1 or is he just a whole pantheon of a million of them like the Mormons we know that there's only one that manifests himself in 3 different ways right so we know who he is we have seen him in this day hallelujah and I'm not just talking about a photograph on Mount sunset or a photograph of the pillar of fire that's God they're not the Prophet by the pillar far above them if they could take a photograph in Egypt with when Moses was there you just replace the Prophet with Moses and that same pillar of fire would have been there Alleluia and so now the thing is he has appeared among us two molars and Seamus into his into his image and that's why God God takes his word in this end time and it's not just a learning but God takes his word and by faith when you receive that word the anointing of the Holy Ghost quickens that word to your makes it live I meant because it's the law of faith that we live by as he wasn't following me III probably not jumping around too much but remember there's a law of faith that we live by and that law of faith is God reveals us would to you you say I believe it and then by receiving it into your heart it produces what that word says I mean so when it says that there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of lamb made in His image made in his likeness she brother bear says she is him because husband or wife become one you know and then something and you says Amen and then you begin to see now the Holy Spirit takes that because you've got to agree you can't just sit back just you know you gotta say amen I think maybe I did did say but when brother Alfa was preaching I was sitting back in that back corner he's praying about the Holy Ghost in these things I just begin to say Amen I agree I felt the Spirit of God just fall on me hallelujah those glorious but before that it was just to what your wonderful suits but when I really said yes and I joined myself to that word that was coming forth and saying I agree hallelujah and the Spirit of God fell upon me out a glorious time that's why you've got to say yes and doesn't matter how you how you feel about well are you worthy to receive it none of us are worthy it doesn't matter what you think about yourself and your battles and your struggles and how you successful you think you own your walk you say Amen I believe your work be it unto me according to thy word I'm in the Oh fine when you receive it in faith you'll see it produce itself hallelujah you say well I'm not worthy to be a sad Oh daughter of God who cares about what you think cuz the devil will try and tell you you're not worthy you fail all the time look at your thought life look at your prayer life is in ruins your reading your everything of your Christian life is in ruins you could say that may be true but say God I want to get back up I believe your word hallelujah be it unto me according to thy word and you'll find something happened to you hallelujah I believe that with all my heart it's the law of faith that we live by the just shall live by faith amen don't be don't be caught up in the magnitude of all these are going to be a revealing of the sons and daughters of God in the same time you find yourself you'll find yourself thinking it's too far away it's too great how could I ever obtain to that no faith says the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth so the promise isn't far away the promises in you I mean the promises I possess it I have the promise that's what faith says I mean Caleb Caleb came out of Egypt he was a slave he seized a mountain where the resurrection will happen he didn't know was going to happen there but there was a resurrection mountain and he says to Joshua give me my Mountain hey man I'm 84 years old I'm just as strong now as I was when I came out hallelujah give me my mountain and then Joshua says I give you this mountain he didn't say you know he didn't get caught up and I was a slave he probably had the scars on his back of the whips he is carrying those for 84 years or however long it was they meant carrying those 40 years through the wilderness maybe he could he could feel it through us through what every war but it didn't keep him bound down he was looking at a promise he was looking at I'm going to receive an inheritance I don't care about the whoops and the slaver and my memory let's not be a slave to our memories I mean who cares about what we did and where we were problem whatever it should be under the blood of Christ I mean your whole life should be confessed under his blood hallelujah Josh Caleb looked at the promise how about you because there were other people that came out maybe they worked with Caleb they received the same beatings they received the same cruel treatment and they felt the same marks and they said we're grasshoppers in their sight we can't take it don't be like those people don't be like those people because you had to think why is God called me out you know if they really set for one second of thought why are we not in Egypt anymore let's think about this for a second why are we not slaves in Egypt anymore why didn't he send a prophet and the Red Sea open and all the great things why did this happen why did he say put the blood of the door lintels of our house and the Death Angel passed over the land and we were safe why did that happen why did we march out why are we here and if they really thought that that's a it's because God wants to take us here he wants the places in the land that's what they should have thought about and you got to think about it now why have I heard a supernatural voice well have I maybe left my associates and what I used to do in something call me here why is he done that he hasn't brought you out here just to die he hasn't brought you out here just to have some miserable existence he brought you out here to be full of joy and rejoicing full of the Holy Ghost amen to be placed in your own here hallelujah that's why he's brought you out here you got to look at where is he taking you I don't care about whereof being there's a reason I had to walk that way but I'm not walking that way again I mean they didn't go back into the wilderness after they cross the river Jordan they went into their inheritance hallelujah it's got to be the same thing with us oh but I've had quite a life we've all had quite a life and God allowed you to go through that life because God had to put something in you that when you find someone else who's struggling with the same thing you struggle with you can enter into their burden and pray for them and God can come on the scene hallelujah there's a reason nothing's in vain now there's in the token message and when God made the first man he made him a son and the son was so corrupt he listened to his wife and said of God and the wife listened to the devil instead of her husband and when it did it was so corrupted them together that it brought a pollution and he knew that when they did that they'd have to bring children to the world the fruit in the midst of the tree could not be touched and then when it was they brought the sin upon themselves and where for the whole human race was born was in sin there was no way to come out there was no way to come out you were born in that condition there was no way to come out that's pretty bad but it's going on and when God came down there's only one way he could get him back that was to get him back a son again just talking about you there's only way to get you back as to any way to get back and how can he do it when his own law stood there and he said he's condemned when the father himself became one of us that's the real Lamb that's his purpose he had in his mind hallelujah amen that's the reason the lamb was so identified in the Garden of Eden knowing that the lamb and of would meet at one time when the lamb and of would be together that's when he knows through that we can all be together and he was willing to make such a sacrifice now that token could be applied that we are no more aliens we are no more strangers amen but we are sons and daughters of God and in both Adam and Eve them the woman and the men joined together as sons and daughters of God and Jesus Christ by his great sacrifice so the Bible says were no more aliens we're no more strangers were no more foreigners and member we're all citizens of the kingdom of God by the blood of Jesus Christ amen he broke down that middle wall of partition he bridged that gulf hallelujah I'm just going to be happy for a little bit he bridge that gulf any one time oz his enemy I mean when we were yet in sin he loved us people say God has never loved me no while you were yen and sin he died for you amen hallelujah so now we are once you know it's like when you come into your country of origin or all the other nationalities they need visas they need whatever they knew but you can just walk in with your passport and you just go through your own gate and you're in but you're back on your home soil hallelu that you you know the saw you came out of I mean where your identity is now that's just a natural a natural land I remember there in God God gives us this holy spirit the token I mean you receive your passport hallelujah because it's waning you know this is where you are from Emme brings you back to your homeland brings you back to you to the Word of God your homeland hallelujah and you begin to walk upon the word I mean back in familiar places and you begin to realize I came out of this soil I came out of this word hallelujah you mean to say this is my identity I mean they say history tells us when the Jews from the Holocaust they they they came back to Israel some of them still had the start you're the other stars on them and all the things that the Nazis gave them but when they came into Israel they changed their garments they put on different ones holy the dinar oh no you know no longer ones who are prisoners of war but they came back to their homeland and they put on a new identity I mean we didn't just survive the Holocaust now we're in our land hallelujah that's the same thing with you and I friends this world as a death camp do you know that this world is a death camp I mean but somehow the doors came open to you well there's a Liberty came I'm in the camp has been liberated and you walk out of that thing you got to take off your prison stripes I mean put on a new garment hallelujah because we're no longer just people have come out of the death camp I never put on a new identity we have a new passport hallelujah we are sons and daughters of God glory to God now then you know this is all from the token message Same Same Same s it's the New Testament it's New Covenant new life shows Jesus has met every requirement for us that God required to make us back truly sons and daughters of God under the blood where there is no more condemnation hallelujah as Jesus said be he perfect as your father in heaven is perfect now we can look at that saying well how could I be perfect you know I have my struggles I've got my humanity which is very much alive you know how could I ever become perfect but the reason he said be perfect is because he was the perfect lamb he was the perfect sacrifice and God demands perfection and the only way he could make you perfect this to give himself as a perfect sacrifice amen to that life that was in that sacrifice comes unto you hallelujah so we are amen Jesus met every requirement amen the Christ not the cross plus and the Philadelphian age with John Wesley they believed that was the blood and their own good behavior you go read about in the church age book but in this age it is the blood alone amen it is the cross alone I mean it is that sacrifice alone hallelujah and the life that was in him comes unto you I'm sorry aren't you glad it's that way onion glad for his Holy Spirit I need glad for his quickening power in you and you're glad for his life the very one that said let there be Sun Moon and stars aim it takes you and washes you hallelujah by one offering Amen he comes and steps into your flesh and sees long enough you're gonna be the place of my rest amen where there is no condemnation Romans 8:1 says there is therefore no now no condemnation to that that are in not those who are believing it but those who are in Christ Jesus that not after the flesh but after the spirit and my word is spirit and life see Oh couldn't I take a text that stay for a couple more hours but we're over at you see he says no more condemnation free from sin free from the cares of the world no no condemn why to them that have been by one spirit baptized into one body they're the blood of the Lamb has been applied the God of heaven has accepted you and his life is in you and you are sons and daughters of God this is you hello sons and daughters of God how you doing today hallelujah your character is God's character because his life is in you what is it a little pushover no sure God is a God of judgment he is a God of correct it must be online nothing else to do that's the kind of character you are because you're the character of your father see what the life watch it the are the life the life out as took for the blood see the life itself was took see the life it took for the blood seeped the blood was applied and the life could no more come on the believed of him for the life of an animal so he's talking about now an animal sacrifice but instead no this is in Spanish too but I got to read this so I couldn't put it in together cuz I don't know where it split he says but see instead of a human being it was a super super super human being see and that makes the human being now not only a human being but he's a son and a daughter of God of the super super super super life that was in him like that comes back upon you and changes you from a sinner and the things of the world a church member and a denomination of God to a born-again Christian filled with the spirit the life of God just flowing from you like sparks from an anvil as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness as the Holy Spirit moving speaking our mind there you are and with them with what hearing the message watching the pillar of fire and the blessed assurance I pass from death to life no there's no condemnation at all that's the same one in Spanish now I mean to that's that's how it should be Alleluia where you see his character his life in you glory to God a man that is his life his nature amen everything he is it's like sparks from an anvil hallelujah I have passed from death unto life amen how we do we are no longer slaves we are sons and daughters of God not one day we are now and if Moses and his position could say let there be you know flies or frogs or whatever those plagues came down he wasn't eat he said let my people go he knew what his commission was let my people go and he went down into Egypt and he did everything his lip remember his yielded to the Spirit of God sure BC will not leave one who fought he didn't negotiate with the enemy this is a son under the blood of bulls and goats he didn't negotiate it and so if you take this all take this he says I'm taking you at all and you're receiving nothing I'm leaving with everything Elliot didn't matter how hard had the heart of Pharaoh got he says they were we are leaving this place hallelujah and if that wasn't someone under the blood of bulls and goats how much more someone under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean that the chasm has been crossed maybe there's still a gulf between God and man in the Old Testament but now that that gulf has been abolished I mean there's no gulf between us and God anymore hallelujah amen Ison God become one hallelujah and so now if that's the case how much more people under the blood of Jesus Christ amen they'd have come - they're placing in the body hallelujah I'm a son of God hallelujah I trust you can say I'm a son or daughter of God not because how I feel about it that's what God says about you what God has made you you had to walk in that I mean can we have some greats of musicians to come here we are friends you say what's being arrogant saying that you are son of God it's not arrogant it shouldn't make you arrogant if you know who you are and him you'll be the most thankful meek humble person in all the world you see brother Brown never a ministry like it in all the world but yet everyone who made him City is the most humble man he's the most humble man he didn't think use anything now that should be the same thing with us where we don't just push our weight around and say listen listen listen this is how does know a real son and daughter of God is humble amen and what walks in real humility not a put-on but a real humility I mean because they know I trust you no it's not your doing remember I'll just say it let's keep our eyes on him your kids about what other people do they're not our measuring stick no one else is our measuring stick but him no only Jesus died for me and if and if he is the one who died for me he should be the one that influences my life the most not what other people say do think or whatever who cares what other people do when it's all said and done it's me and him how about you amen let's let's stand
