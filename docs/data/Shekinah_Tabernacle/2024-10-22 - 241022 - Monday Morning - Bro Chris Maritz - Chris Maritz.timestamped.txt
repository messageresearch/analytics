[58:33] um and then we'll just see how the Lord
[58:35] leads but you know we just love to go to
[58:38] the word the word is what encourages us
[58:40] and this morning I want to just take a
[58:42] story
[58:44] and I want to call the sermon today
[58:46] Abigail's headship
[58:48] and want to look at the story and and
[58:50] the story helps us understand really
[58:53] what God has done for us with a headship
[58:54] that he's provided in our lives and to
[58:57] do this we need to go through the New
[58:59] Testament Romans 7. so if you'll turn
[59:01] that with me this morning Romans 7 verse
[59:05] 1.
[59:07] Romans 7 verse 1.
[59:17] says know ye not brethren for I speak to
[59:19] them that know the law how that the law
[59:22] hath dominion over a man as long as he
[59:24] liveth for the woman which hath and
[59:26] husband is bound by the law to her
[59:28] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[59:31] husband be dead she is loose from the
[59:33] law of her husband
[59:36] so then if while her husband liveth she
[59:38] be married to another man he shall be
[59:41] called an adulterous but if her husband
[59:43] is dead she is free from that law so
[59:46] that she is no adulteress though she be
[59:48] married to another man wherefore my
[59:51] brother and you also are become dead to
[59:52] the law by the body of Christ that you
[59:56] should be married to another even to him
[59:58] who is raised from the dead that we
[1:00:01] should be brought that we should bring
[1:00:02] forth fruit unto God for when we were in
[1:00:06] the flesh the Motions of sins which were
[1:00:09] by the law did work in our members to
[1:00:12] bring forth fruit unto death but now I
[1:00:15] love that amen but now we are delivered
[1:00:17] from the law
[1:00:19] that being dead wherein we were held
[1:00:22] that we should serve in newness of
[1:00:24] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[1:00:26] letter let's just borrow his morning
[1:00:28] gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we
[1:00:30] love you this morning and surely we as
[1:00:32] that song Lord can say Lord that all our
[1:00:35] lives you have been faithful to us and
[1:00:37] even now at this moment Lord you are
[1:00:39] faithful Lord and you know Lord as we
[1:00:42] are closing this this this session of
[1:00:44] services Lord in this Camp Lord we just
[1:00:46] ask that you would come Lord father that
[1:00:49] you would drop something into our hearts
[1:00:50] Lord that would give us strength that
[1:00:52] would give us courage give us Faith Lord
[1:00:54] for this last lap of the race that we
[1:00:56] are running Lord as we want to run a
[1:00:58] good race Lord we want to find a good
[1:00:59] fight Lord the Lord we ask you you would
[1:01:02] come Lord we just humble ourselves
[1:01:04] before you this morning that you would
[1:01:05] speak Lord give us Words of Life Lord
[1:01:08] encourage us for the journey father give
[1:01:11] us Clarity of thought and mind Lord oh
[1:01:13] Father we love you this morning we
[1:01:15] appreciate all that you've done for us
[1:01:16] Lord we thank you for this time we can
[1:01:18] spend together and just as you would
[1:01:20] come now bless the reading of your word
[1:01:22] and in Jesus Christ then we pray amen
[1:01:24] and amen
[1:01:26] amen you may have your seats
[1:01:30] so we see the story of of of this
[1:01:33] husband and wife here in in Romans 7 and
[1:01:36] that there that we were Bound by this
[1:01:38] law even nobody likes to be bound by the
[1:01:40] law you know you have to go certain
[1:01:42] speed limits and you have to do this and
[1:01:43] you can only do that and you know you
[1:01:45] have to pay certain taxes and you know
[1:01:47] all these little things seem to kind of
[1:01:49] restrict or govern or bind you right now
[1:01:52] some of those things are good but you
[1:01:54] know in this case when it's the when
[1:01:56] being bound by the law of the flesh as
[1:01:58] it works in our members you know it's
[1:02:00] not a good thing and so it speaks of a
[1:02:03] headship or something that influences or
[1:02:05] leads and but God is telling us today
[1:02:08] that we are not bound by that law
[1:02:10] anymore amen that we have another law
[1:02:12] amen the law of the newness of spirit
[1:02:14] not the oldness of the letter and to
[1:02:17] really understand how this works I I was
[1:02:19] inspired to go to the story of Abigail
[1:02:21] and where I'd like to illustrate this
[1:02:23] this principle of the two different laws
[1:02:26] that work in our lives and and how that
[1:02:28] works through the story of Abigail find
[1:02:31] the story of Abigail in first Samuel and
[1:02:33] 25. now today I'm going to just focus on
[1:02:36] the story so if you want to follow along
[1:02:37] you can you can have your Bibles open to
[1:02:40] those places there in first Samuel and
[1:02:42] 25. now there's very little said about
[1:02:44] Abigail
[1:02:45] you know there's brother Brandon
[1:02:47] mentions her mentions her only twice I
[1:02:49] believe in in the whole message the once
[1:02:51] in reference to marriage and divorce and
[1:02:53] then in another place speaking about
[1:02:55] headship and this is really you know if
[1:02:57] if we if we if we zoom out from the
[1:03:00] message and we look at the whole message
[1:03:02] you'll find that really the story of
[1:03:03] Abigail is the whole message you know so
[1:03:06] the prophet does speak about Abigail in
[1:03:07] types and shadows and and in patterns
[1:03:10] and we're going to find this as we go
[1:03:11] into the story today
[1:03:13] Samuel here in the in the very in the
[1:03:15] very beginning here first Samuel 25 it
[1:03:17] begins right off by letting us know that
[1:03:19] Samuel the prophet of the day I mean he
[1:03:22] was that he was the the prophet he was
[1:03:24] the word of God for that day and it says
[1:03:26] that he had passed off the scene you
[1:03:28] know Samuel the prophet was dead and so
[1:03:30] we see right in this transition of
[1:03:32] Samuel passing off the scene you know
[1:03:34] David was anointed to be king and and we
[1:03:37] see this great transition taking place
[1:03:39] and and how David was going to become
[1:03:41] king over all of Israel and he was
[1:03:43] anointed to be king but he wasn't king
[1:03:45] yet at this time so so we see how that
[1:03:47] the prophet has moved off the scene we
[1:03:50] have this little woman Abigail who's
[1:03:51] kind of a mystery in the story at this
[1:03:54] time and then we see how that the king
[1:03:55] king is coming to be king over Israel
[1:03:58] and his name is David and so we find
[1:04:00] ourselves right in the very pattern
[1:04:02] again of where we live right now because
[1:04:04] the prophet has moved off the scene and
[1:04:07] we're living right in this little Gap
[1:04:08] here where where King David is coming
[1:04:11] Amen in the Millennium reign and so we
[1:04:14] we're kind of living right in this very
[1:04:16] story this very moment of Abigail's life
[1:04:18] and I'm so thankful that God put Abigail
[1:04:20] in the scriptures that we can look at
[1:04:22] her life and we can see the patterns we
[1:04:24] can see what God did for Abigail amen
[1:04:26] because he's doing it for us
[1:04:28] amen we are Abigail in the story
[1:04:32] so we see how Samuel passes off and
[1:04:34] David what's David doing David's running
[1:04:36] you're right he's hiding he's kind of
[1:04:40] this this hit this mystery you know he's
[1:04:43] hiding from from persecution and you
[1:04:45] know what has happened is David has
[1:04:47] become rejected by his own family right
[1:04:50] he got rejected to those who whom he was
[1:04:53] sent to he was rejected so we find him
[1:04:55] he he he's kind of uh you know running
[1:04:57] around all of all the country sides and
[1:05:00] finding places to sleep and you know
[1:05:02] wherever he's welcome you know there
[1:05:04] he'll stay and and just kind of this you
[1:05:06] know who is this David running around
[1:05:08] amen but I want you to know that in all
[1:05:10] this time David was fighting for Israel
[1:05:12] amen even though he was rejected you
[1:05:15] know he he didn't leave them alone he he
[1:05:18] still fought for Israel during this time
[1:05:20] protecting them and watching over them
[1:05:22] fighting Israel's enemy enemies amen oh
[1:05:25] I hope you've got your spiritual
[1:05:26] thinking caps on this morning
[1:05:28] and so here we find Abigail this little
[1:05:30] mystery woman in the story coming from
[1:05:32] the south of Judah and you can look at
[1:05:34] her lineages and and so forth It's
[1:05:36] really beautiful how God put all this
[1:05:37] together and Abigail her name means my
[1:05:40] father's Joy
[1:05:42] so here this little mystery woman she's
[1:05:44] got a meaning to her name amen she's her
[1:05:47] father's Joy even though she may be
[1:05:49] going through a Troublesome time even
[1:05:51] though she's maybe facing hardships and
[1:05:53] things but my brother and sister her
[1:05:55] real name the real herd like our brother
[1:05:56] condrey's been preaching and the real
[1:05:58] you amen is my father's Joy
[1:06:02] the woman also of good understanding in
[1:06:05] other words she had she had the ability
[1:06:07] to when she heard the word to understand
[1:06:09] it amen she had understanding she had
[1:06:12] wisdom there was something about Abigail
[1:06:14] where where something happens she would
[1:06:16] understand she had discernment for what
[1:06:17] was happening like that woman at the
[1:06:19] well and another meaning for her name is
[1:06:22] that she was beautiful you know that's
[1:06:24] really how God saw her through you know
[1:06:27] as we get into the story of Abigail
[1:06:28] remember this is how God sees her
[1:06:31] right no matter what her circumstances
[1:06:33] were or the conditions we find Abigail
[1:06:35] in her name means beautiful this is how
[1:06:38] God sees her because God was doing
[1:06:40] something for her during this time so
[1:06:43] let's let's look a little bit at Abigail
[1:06:44] now we want to focus in on headship
[1:06:46] because this the the subject matter here
[1:06:49] is Abigail's headship and as we enter
[1:06:52] the story of Abigail we find that
[1:06:54] Abigail is under a certain headship
[1:06:57] oh boy she's she's being led by some
[1:07:01] thing you know headship speaks of
[1:07:03] control it speaks of influence it speaks
[1:07:06] of leadership it speaks of dictatorship
[1:07:09] you know it can mean all those kinds of
[1:07:11] things headship what kind of headship
[1:07:13] are we sitting under right now this very
[1:07:15] morning what is influencing your
[1:07:17] thoughts what is what is governing your
[1:07:19] life you know this is speaking of
[1:07:20] headship because I believe the bride is
[1:07:22] sitting under a headship today and it's
[1:07:24] for a reason my brother and sister
[1:07:26] now her husband at the time was Mabel
[1:07:30] and I want you to notice that you know
[1:07:31] he wasn't a Philistine or something like
[1:07:33] that he was on the house of Caleb you
[1:07:36] know he he was in the message you know
[1:07:39] this guy was he grew up in the message
[1:07:40] he's from the right Bloodlines and all
[1:07:42] these things but you know something
[1:07:44] happened with nabel
[1:07:46] he it also thought it was amazing how my
[1:07:49] brother Condrey was was hitting on these
[1:07:50] things he was a rich man
[1:07:52] you know he was a rich man my brother
[1:07:54] and sister he had he had goods and
[1:07:56] cattle and all kinds of possessions he
[1:07:58] even had a Vineyard and as the Bible
[1:08:01] says he liveth in prosperity
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:04] so this was her her husband was someone
[1:08:07] you know they weren't poor people that
[1:08:09] were scrounging for little bits of food
[1:08:11] here and there and Beggars on the street
[1:08:13] somewhere no she had a really good
[1:08:15] environment if you think about it
[1:08:17] yeah you know she had all the goods you
[1:08:19] know like lay the Sia
[1:08:21] rich half need of nothing right and
[1:08:24] doesn't know that she is blind and
[1:08:26] miserable naked right but this is a
[1:08:29] condition we find Abigail in but her her
[1:08:32] husband's name means fool
[1:08:36] even though he was rich he had all those
[1:08:38] great things now remember this is head
[1:08:40] shift now now I'm going to drop this in
[1:08:42] here just for a moment here remember
[1:08:43] headship speaks of of those two
[1:08:45] different laws
[1:08:46] all right let's get take it right back
[1:08:48] to Romans 7 now where he was saying that
[1:08:50] he's relating the the the marriage
[1:08:52] relationship between a husband and a
[1:08:54] wife to the same headship type figure of
[1:08:57] what your flesh is or the law of the
[1:09:00] spirit so we're either like headship
[1:09:02] being our flesh or headship can be our
[1:09:04] the spirit of God in our life so our
[1:09:07] flesh can be a headship
[1:09:09] right we're going to see these parallels
[1:09:10] Nable just so in case you're wondering
[1:09:12] Naval is the type of the flesh
[1:09:15] so as we talk about navel in the story
[1:09:17] today remember he types our flesh and
[1:09:20] his name means fool even though he may
[1:09:22] feel good even though he might be young
[1:09:24] and strong and have all the goods in the
[1:09:26] world maybe a rich man my brother and
[1:09:28] sister if it's only carnal
[1:09:31] he's a fool
[1:09:33] he lived in Mayon his possessions were
[1:09:36] in Carmel I mean he he lived in in the
[1:09:38] great places he lived in all the right
[1:09:40] position and you know in the right lands
[1:09:42] and you know everything was what seems
[1:09:44] right but let's look at his name a
[1:09:46] little bit further his name literally
[1:09:48] means churlish
[1:09:51] it sounds like uh sour milk
[1:09:55] Fearless what does it mean to be surely
[1:09:58] now remember this is kind of headship
[1:10:00] that Abigail's under how many you know
[1:10:02] sisters here would like to live under a
[1:10:03] headship like this
[1:10:05] husband that is fearless
[1:10:08] huh there was no amen that's good
[1:10:11] what does churlish mean
[1:10:13] now remember this is our flesh
[1:10:16] it means to be severe
[1:10:19] this is Abigail's environment
[1:10:24] it means to be cruel
[1:10:27] Grievous
[1:10:29] hard-hearted
[1:10:31] heavy-handed
[1:10:33] impudent obstinate always prevailing
[1:10:37] like it like a dictator it means to be
[1:10:40] rough
[1:10:41] or sore or sorrowful
[1:10:44] stiff-neck stubborn and always in
[1:10:47] trouble
[1:10:49] the flesh
[1:10:50] this was the headship now I want us to
[1:10:52] put ourselves in Abigail's kind of scene
[1:10:55] you know in her home this is what she
[1:10:57] lived under this was her headship this
[1:11:00] is what it's like to live under the
[1:11:01] headship of the flesh our flesh is
[1:11:03] severe it carries scars it reminds us of
[1:11:07] things always telling us that we are not
[1:11:09] capable we're not strong enough you know
[1:11:11] it governs our our emotions and all
[1:11:13] kinds of things in our walk with the
[1:11:15] Lord and it's stubborn and stiff-necked
[1:11:18] it's cruel
[1:11:22] but another headship was coming amen
[1:11:25] a new headship was coming to Abigail now
[1:11:28] look at the season here this is in
[1:11:30] harvest season
[1:11:32] when this story is taking place where we
[1:11:34] find Abigail in this condition of of a
[1:11:36] of a terrible husband
[1:11:38] and we find out David is coming in in a
[1:11:41] certain season you know it's a season of
[1:11:43] harvest and and plenty
[1:11:45] and so what David does now I want you to
[1:11:48] look at the different kinds of headships
[1:11:51] look at the the stark contrast between
[1:11:53] the two different kinds of headstrip
[1:11:55] here David speaking of another headship
[1:11:57] which in our story is going to be a type
[1:12:00] of the spirit of Christ in our lives and
[1:12:02] you find that David here he approaches
[1:12:04] things very differently than nabel does
[1:12:07] David when he comes he's looking for
[1:12:10] food for his men you know they've been
[1:12:12] fighting the Philistines and protecting
[1:12:14] Mabel's lands and his Vineyards and and
[1:12:16] literally allowing nabel to be
[1:12:18] prosperous
[1:12:19] this is the part that Naval doesn't
[1:12:21] really understand amen but look at how
[1:12:24] that David when he comes to approach
[1:12:25] navel for food for his men he sends
[1:12:28] Messengers ahead of him you know he
[1:12:30] doesn't just come barging in and they
[1:12:32] know expecting something no he's a
[1:12:34] gentleman and so what does he do he
[1:12:36] sends Messengers ahead of him amen
[1:12:38] preparing the ground letting the people
[1:12:40] know what his intentions are I mean he's
[1:12:43] soft and he's kind any any sincere amen
[1:12:47] he's respectful look at the examples as
[1:12:50] we even see in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:12:51] invitations being sent out Messengers
[1:12:54] being sent out and I love this setting
[1:12:55] we find ourselves in this morning like a
[1:12:58] wedding kind of setting here this
[1:12:59] morning amen
[1:13:00] what does he say his first words that
[1:13:03] comes out of his mouth now remember look
[1:13:05] at the contrast between David and Abel
[1:13:07] the naval being cruel and hard and and
[1:13:09] stubborn and sorrowful and hurtful kind
[1:13:12] of a person here David's the first words
[1:13:15] that comes out of his his Messengers
[1:13:17] mouths are peace be unto you
[1:13:20] in other words Shalom amen peace be unto
[1:13:24] you and to your house
[1:13:25] in other words your children in other
[1:13:28] words David's thinking not just of the
[1:13:29] individual anybody's thinking about the
[1:13:31] families and their children and all
[1:13:33] those things he comes with a message of
[1:13:35] peace
[1:13:36] even though remember David is a warrior
[1:13:38] he's a fighter he's a hunter amen he
[1:13:41] knows what he's doing but he doesn't
[1:13:43] come that way to nabel you know he
[1:13:44] doesn't come there with a drawn sword
[1:13:46] and threats and judgment know his first
[1:13:49] approach my brother and sister is always
[1:13:51] with a message of peace
[1:13:53] Hallelujah
[1:13:55] peace unto you and your house and unto
[1:13:58] all that you have in verse 7 we find how
[1:14:01] that he remarks on his Shepherds that
[1:14:03] were shearing the sheep near the
[1:14:05] Wilderness of Paran in that ornamental
[1:14:07] type desert as the name would denote for
[1:14:09] us today but he compliments them on
[1:14:12] their work you know even we sign we see
[1:14:14] even in Book of Revelation how that
[1:14:16] those Messengers come and they and gods
[1:14:18] through those Messengers compliments the
[1:14:20] people of the day the Believers amen I
[1:14:22] know your works and you know so God
[1:14:24] compliments amen he's encouraging why
[1:14:28] because he's trying to find a way into
[1:14:30] to your heart amen David what's the
[1:14:32] reason nabel was being blessed and so he
[1:14:35] comes and he and he makes gestures of of
[1:14:38] friendliness amen I love a god like that
[1:14:41] you know God isn't here to hurt you my
[1:14:44] brother and sister he doesn't come to
[1:14:46] judge you he comes he comes as a friend
[1:14:48] he comes in peace amen hallelujah
[1:14:53] and he makes a note of the protection
[1:14:55] that his Shepherds have had during this
[1:14:57] time and why why did Mabel have
[1:15:00] protection why did his Shepherds have
[1:15:02] protection it was because of the
[1:15:04] proximity they had to David
[1:15:07] okay now this is important because you
[1:15:10] know we can be in proximity to David
[1:15:12] right we can be in proximity you know in
[1:15:14] other words we can come to church and we
[1:15:16] can be in proximity of the blessings but
[1:15:18] not actually be under the headship of
[1:15:20] David see these Shepherds they were
[1:15:23] feeling the blessings they were they
[1:15:24] were reaping the rewards and and the and
[1:15:27] the benefits of David's headship but
[1:15:29] we're not under David's headship yet
[1:15:32] this is very important see we can live
[1:15:34] under the blessings we we sing the songs
[1:15:36] of worship and man I enjoyed that you
[1:15:38] know we live a good clean life and our
[1:15:40] families are strong and you know that's
[1:15:42] what being in proximity to the message
[1:15:44] has done for us but my brother and
[1:15:46] sister don't just live in proximity we
[1:15:49] need to come under the headship of David
[1:15:52] thank you
[1:15:53] Hallelujah
[1:15:57] so because of their location they were
[1:15:59] reaping from the rewards like the Holy
[1:16:01] Ghost being poured out in our day look
[1:16:03] at how Pentecost reap from the benefits
[1:16:06] of the proximity of Jesus Christ in our
[1:16:08] day Hallelujah
[1:16:10] but the point here is is that David
[1:16:12] comes not to hurt
[1:16:15] he doesn't come to do anything that you
[1:16:17] cannot handle
[1:16:19] you see he doesn't come to to hurt that
[1:16:22] word there is to to not to wound yeah he
[1:16:26] doesn't want to wound you he doesn't
[1:16:29] come to tease
[1:16:31] you know he doesn't come with an agenda
[1:16:33] and says you know he comes in peace and
[1:16:35] he's not really coming in peace
[1:16:37] his true motive towards you is to bring
[1:16:39] you to a destination
[1:16:43] he doesn't come to insult
[1:16:47] oh my
[1:16:48] God then he goes on he says also we did
[1:16:51] not hurt them or take any of their sheep
[1:16:53] in other words we did not abuse
[1:16:57] you know we did not abuse your shepherds
[1:16:59] in the sense of we did not take
[1:17:01] advantage
[1:17:02] of the fact that we are warriors
[1:17:04] and that you know you know he they could
[1:17:06] have come so different they could have
[1:17:07] said you know we we are the reason why
[1:17:09] you have sheep we're the reason why you
[1:17:11] have all these things so so we're just
[1:17:12] going to take a shape and we're going to
[1:17:14] slaughter one and and we're gonna have
[1:17:15] one for supper you know they they didn't
[1:17:17] abuse their position
[1:17:19] you know these men knew their position
[1:17:21] you know the messengers of God they they
[1:17:23] know their positions they don't abuse
[1:17:25] their Authority they're not dictators
[1:17:27] you know they're not licking
[1:17:29] nicolaitanisms you know there's nothing
[1:17:31] like that in them they they totally are
[1:17:34] there to protect you
[1:17:37] and so they start to describe the the
[1:17:39] setting that was happening out there in
[1:17:41] the field to these men
[1:17:45] you know this is much very very
[1:17:47] different very you know opposite if we
[1:17:49] can say it like that to the way that
[1:17:51] nabel had been treating Abigail
[1:17:54] think of Abigail's environment
[1:17:57] and hear this message of Hope is coming
[1:17:59] out across the field in The Vineyards
[1:18:02] amen
[1:18:03] oh my verse 8 goes on
[1:18:05] and The Messengers come and they say we
[1:18:07] have come on a good day
[1:18:09] we have come on a good day what are they
[1:18:12] saying when they say we have come on the
[1:18:13] good day in other words these Messengers
[1:18:15] did not come in a time of famine
[1:18:19] they did not come in a time when nabel
[1:18:21] would not be able to offer them food
[1:18:22] where Nable would not be able to help
[1:18:25] them you know these Messengers knew this
[1:18:27] was a time of Plenty this was Feast time
[1:18:29] this was Harvest Time and so the
[1:18:32] messengers request was not unreasonable
[1:18:38] now remember this we're talking about
[1:18:39] the Flesh and the spirit of God
[1:18:42] you know
[1:18:43] the request that God makes to us you
[1:18:45] know we think of like all these rules
[1:18:47] and regulations we have and do's and
[1:18:49] don'ts God's request is not unreasonable
[1:18:54] he comes in a good day amen his request
[1:18:57] in other words was not unfair like that
[1:19:00] that like the prophet asking the woman
[1:19:01] for that last little bit of bread and
[1:19:04] oil was was his request unfair no but
[1:19:07] you see there was a blessing that was
[1:19:08] coming behind that that request
[1:19:11] amen and that's God he's saying come
[1:19:13] unto me amen his request is not unfair
[1:19:15] he comes in a good day this is a day of
[1:19:18] your salvation
[1:19:21] you see David's request did not add an
[1:19:24] extra burden upon Naval
[1:19:27] that God doesn't come to add burdens to
[1:19:29] your life amen it might feel like that
[1:19:31] sometimes but his yoke is easy my
[1:19:33] brother and sister
[1:19:36] Hallelujah see it was a day that nabel
[1:19:38] had a feast and this Feast meant that
[1:19:40] there would be plenty to go around in
[1:19:42] those days when they had a feast it
[1:19:43] wasn't like you know we're gonna go have
[1:19:44] supper and buy some people over and we
[1:19:46] make just enough food for for the
[1:19:48] evening and we count the plates and we
[1:19:50] count how much food and you know it
[1:19:51] wasn't like that these when they did
[1:19:53] feast and in eastern Traditions it
[1:19:55] lasted for days and they always made
[1:19:57] sure here's the key they always made
[1:19:59] sure they had food for strangers that
[1:20:01] might come in
[1:20:03] and David knew this
[1:20:05] you see David knew this his request was
[1:20:07] not unreasonable there would be plenty
[1:20:10] of food to go around for him and his men
[1:20:12] and yet he comes and he makes a request
[1:20:15] to have food
[1:20:18] it would be a day when everyone was
[1:20:20] happy and in good spirits
[1:20:23] like Pentecost
[1:20:25] everyone's happy the the spirit of God
[1:20:27] is being poured out upon the people and
[1:20:28] there's gifts and all kinds of Miracles
[1:20:30] being being on display and all these
[1:20:33] wonderful things at the time of
[1:20:34] happiness
[1:20:38] oh my
[1:20:39] he's not an unreasonable God
[1:20:43] like some King asking for tribute asking
[1:20:45] for things in in a bad time
[1:20:48] oh my God never asked us to do anything
[1:20:51] beyond what we can handle or Supply his
[1:20:54] yoke is easy my brother and sister David
[1:20:55] asked gently to give it to his servants
[1:20:58] and look at this he says unto thy son
[1:21:01] he humbles himself even
[1:21:04] into thy son as he knew they were from
[1:21:06] the same tribe
[1:21:08] oh my goodness
[1:21:10] they were from the same tribe it's not
[1:21:12] you know it's not these are not like
[1:21:14] they're not strangers they know each
[1:21:17] other they you know we're you know this
[1:21:20] is how our flesh Works they're gonna say
[1:21:21] our flesh truly is cruel it is severe
[1:21:26] and David even knows we have a
[1:21:28] connection we're like family can you
[1:21:30] imagine coming to a family member and
[1:21:32] asking for for some butter you know you
[1:21:34] ran out of butter you know or you ran
[1:21:37] out of sugar or something and you
[1:21:38] comment you know he's family you're not
[1:21:40] expecting them to turn you away
[1:21:42] you know it's family you get there's a
[1:21:44] connection you care for each other
[1:21:45] David's saying thy son you you know what
[1:21:48] that servants we've come to you and we
[1:21:50] we would like to Feast with you and
[1:21:52] share in this plenty you know and and
[1:21:54] day and and recognizing that we're even
[1:21:56] from the same tribes navel even being
[1:21:59] his senior
[1:22:01] oh my can you imagine the young men of
[1:22:03] today coming to the seniors and the
[1:22:05] message asking for something of God huh
[1:22:10] nabel being a senior oh my what can you
[1:22:13] spare for your servants heaven verse 10
[1:22:17] look at the response here
[1:22:19] this this is and I want us to really uh
[1:22:23] focus in here on this is now the time
[1:22:24] for the flesh this is how the flesh
[1:22:27] responds to to this kind of thing
[1:22:30] who is David
[1:22:36] oh that's good right
[1:22:38] what does navel think of himself
[1:22:40] or his current condition
[1:22:42] to answer like that
[1:22:45] so we've just heard the kind of message
[1:22:47] that's come
[1:22:48] but now the response is who is David in
[1:22:52] other words who does David think he is
[1:22:56] wow I thought I thought David was
[1:22:58] protecting your your men out in the
[1:23:00] fields I thought you were related to
[1:23:02] David I thought you were from the same
[1:23:04] tribe and yet the flesh has no way of
[1:23:09] recognizing Who David is
[1:23:12] he has no way of recognizing this is so
[1:23:15] important my brother and sister that's
[1:23:16] why I say like you cannot go by your
[1:23:18] emotions you cannot go by feelings it
[1:23:21] goes so much deeper than that our
[1:23:23] headship cannot be flesh-bound
[1:23:26] hey man we've got to go we we need a
[1:23:28] change amen that we need to be led by
[1:23:31] the spirit amen because our flesh can
[1:23:34] never recognize David
[1:23:35] and David is the one who brings the
[1:23:37] blessings David is the good headship
[1:23:40] amen so we see how that our flesh is
[1:23:42] unable to recognize Who David is
[1:23:46] as long as we approach church as long as
[1:23:48] we come to church as long as we approach
[1:23:50] God my brother and sister in the flesh
[1:23:52] you're not really going to get to know
[1:23:55] him
[1:23:56] you need to go deeper you need to die
[1:23:58] this thing is in all your flesh needs to
[1:24:01] be cast down and brought subject to the
[1:24:04] word amen you need to come under a whole
[1:24:06] different headship don't approach god
[1:24:08] with your emotions don't approach god
[1:24:10] with memories and reasonings my brother
[1:24:13] and sister you need a different headship
[1:24:14] if you want to recognize Who David is
[1:24:19] so important you know we do so much
[1:24:23] flesh Management in the ministry dealing
[1:24:26] with emotions and trying to Band-Aid
[1:24:29] this and trying to patch this up and
[1:24:31] trying to make somebody feel good and
[1:24:32] and and and and and wipe memories away
[1:24:34] and and through reasoning try and get
[1:24:36] them to cope and and understand my my
[1:24:39] brother and sister we need to just
[1:24:40] change all that you cannot serve God In
[1:24:43] the Flesh
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:47] amen
[1:24:49] you see Mabel was high-minded
[1:24:53] and unconscious
[1:24:55] of the repercussions
[1:24:58] of his actions
[1:24:59] that's our flesh unconscious
[1:25:03] of the repercussions of our flesh in
[1:25:06] other words Abigail
[1:25:08] is back at home
[1:25:10] she's in her room somewhere maybe in the
[1:25:12] garden somewhere and has no idea what
[1:25:16] her headship
[1:25:18] is doing
[1:25:20] think about this for a moment my brother
[1:25:22] and sister no idea
[1:25:24] you know she was caught like in a bear's
[1:25:26] claw
[1:25:27] you know she was in a really bad
[1:25:29] situation because she really didn't have
[1:25:31] a say in what was happening here you see
[1:25:34] that is our flesh
[1:25:36] right so she had no no way of of even
[1:25:38] knowing I'm so glad you know you think
[1:25:40] of that woman at the well right she had
[1:25:42] no way you know looking for something
[1:25:44] she knew something was off she knew that
[1:25:46] there was something more but she was
[1:25:48] looking at for it in flesh in different
[1:25:51] husbands in different headships and
[1:25:53] couldn't find it until the seventh one
[1:25:55] came along amen
[1:25:57] yeah but see
[1:25:59] she couldn't as long as she was bound by
[1:26:01] that law she didn't have a say
[1:26:05] she had no way of having an influence on
[1:26:07] what her headship was doing
[1:26:09] oh my
[1:26:12] in other words
[1:26:14] her flesh her headship was making
[1:26:17] decisions on her behalf
[1:26:19] that would bring repercussions
[1:26:22] that eventually would destroy Abigail
[1:26:26] yeah flesh does that
[1:26:28] we open our ear to something or open our
[1:26:31] hearts to something and our flesh is
[1:26:33] doing something my brother and sister
[1:26:34] you have no idea
[1:26:36] of the repercussions you know it's
[1:26:38] amazing you can and I know God has a
[1:26:40] season for everyone but you know you can
[1:26:42] you can tell them you know there's a
[1:26:44] better way and you know there's why not
[1:26:46] come under the headship of the Lord you
[1:26:49] know he'll take care of all your
[1:26:50] troubles you know his yoke is easy amen
[1:26:53] he loves you he cares for you and to
[1:26:55] hear all of that my brother and sister
[1:26:57] but something is is not allowing them
[1:26:59] their flesh is not allowing them to come
[1:27:01] out from under that headship
[1:27:03] but see this there's something that
[1:27:05] needs to happen and we'll get to that
[1:27:08] so he was unaware of the consequences
[1:27:10] she also being unaware of the
[1:27:12] consequences that was coming you know to
[1:27:15] basically spit in the messenger's face
[1:27:18] to Mock and insult David's servants
[1:27:20] you'll find that he doesn't just say no
[1:27:22] you know I I like a Canadian would you
[1:27:24] know I'm sorry but we're just not
[1:27:26] interested you know very gently that's
[1:27:29] not how this guy did it right this guy
[1:27:31] was cruel
[1:27:33] he doesn't just say no but he goes and
[1:27:35] insults David
[1:27:38] that's our flesh for you huh you know we
[1:27:41] got to put this flesh down because it's
[1:27:43] terrible
[1:27:45] see he he it was about he he was not
[1:27:48] about to share or give anything and so
[1:27:49] what does he do he doesn't just say no
[1:27:51] he starts to make accusations
[1:27:53] oh my goodness you know starts to try
[1:27:56] and justify himself maybe huh tries to
[1:28:00] justify why he doesn't have to do
[1:28:01] something well I don't have to come
[1:28:03] under that headship or why I don't have
[1:28:05] to share with all the blessings that
[1:28:07] I've received or or recognize that David
[1:28:10] is here in our in our midst you know
[1:28:12] there's there's something about our
[1:28:13] flesh that is unable to do those things
[1:28:17] it's under a curse
[1:28:21] curse of the wrong headship
[1:28:24] oh my
[1:28:25] and that's really something because if
[1:28:27] you think about Abigail's situation she
[1:28:30] might she was a woman of understanding
[1:28:32] she might have known like something's
[1:28:33] wrong
[1:28:34] right we'll get to that in a minute but
[1:28:37] think of it you know she was bound by a
[1:28:40] law
[1:28:42] by a law in other words she couldn't
[1:28:44] just one day say you know what this is
[1:28:45] this is kind of lame
[1:28:47] and I'm out of here
[1:28:49] I'm leaving
[1:28:50] and just walk away get a divorce right
[1:28:53] she couldn't do that because she is
[1:28:55] bound by a law
[1:28:59] he pretends not to know them he pretends
[1:29:02] not to know David
[1:29:04] and he sends them away
[1:29:06] empty-handed not realizing that he owes
[1:29:08] David
[1:29:09] everything
[1:29:11] he had he owed to David
[1:29:15] see naval's condition his nature did not
[1:29:17] allow him to see really who David was
[1:29:20] to recognize who was calling unto him
[1:29:27] are you the son of Jesse he says
[1:29:31] you know Jesus asked the same question
[1:29:33] in his day who do you say that I the son
[1:29:35] of man am
[1:29:36] Peter received Revelation Thou Art the
[1:29:38] Christ the son of the Living God you see
[1:29:40] Revelation did what for Peter it gave
[1:29:42] Peter access to the blessings that was
[1:29:45] in front of him
[1:29:47] so Revelation is Paramount that's what
[1:29:49] God built his church on see and this is
[1:29:51] the process that we go through right
[1:29:53] amen is that God gives us Revelation so
[1:29:56] that we can see I'm so thankful that God
[1:29:58] showed us by Revelation who he is in our
[1:30:01] day
[1:30:02] that we can see him amen
[1:30:06] notice this question here are you the
[1:30:08] son of Jesse
[1:30:10] something very important happening here
[1:30:16] are you the son of Jesse
[1:30:19] in other words he's almost admitting
[1:30:21] like the devil
[1:30:23] right if Thou Art the son of God
[1:30:26] he knows he knows enough but the flesh
[1:30:29] cannot
[1:30:31] you know it's always reasoning always
[1:30:33] questioning you know it's same old
[1:30:36] tricks Same Old Devil same old headship
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:41] all right the same thing was about to
[1:30:43] happen to Abigail and her revelation of
[1:30:45] Who David really was would give her
[1:30:46] access to His blessings
[1:30:49] not just access but would change her
[1:30:52] headship
[1:30:54] so don't forget who Abigail is is and
[1:30:57] all this don't forget her behind the
[1:30:59] scenes here as we're moving forward her
[1:31:00] headship is making decisions on her
[1:31:03] behalf and and David's trying to gain
[1:31:05] access and David's trying to bless and
[1:31:07] he's looking for worship he's looking
[1:31:09] for something in return right and in the
[1:31:11] meantime Abigail has no say in all this
[1:31:13] but her headship is failing her
[1:31:17] look at David's response here in verse
[1:31:19] 13.
[1:31:21] I think it's incredible all the numbers
[1:31:23] everything here just lines up perfectly
[1:31:24] because 13 is the is the number of the
[1:31:27] US and all these things right so look at
[1:31:29] this here David realized who and what he
[1:31:32] was dealing with because of the
[1:31:33] treatment to his servants
[1:31:36] and rejected and rejecting of his kind
[1:31:39] requests what does he do he turns from a
[1:31:43] god of Grace
[1:31:44] to a god of judgment
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:47] David's a warrior remember this is not
[1:31:49] like a big deal for him he just arms his
[1:31:52] men
[1:31:53] right same old procedure right
[1:31:56] he arms 400 of his men to go and deal
[1:31:59] with Naval so now because of the
[1:32:02] rejection of the message so this is
[1:32:04] Abigail's headship right she he rejected
[1:32:08] the message he rejected David and the
[1:32:11] benefits and now it's turned to a
[1:32:13] judgment
[1:32:15] and Abigail doesn't even realize what's
[1:32:17] happened just yet
[1:32:20] can you imagine that right we're born in
[1:32:22] sun-shaped and iniquity
[1:32:24] coming to the world speaking lies
[1:32:27] here we find out one day hey wait a
[1:32:29] minute wait a minute
[1:32:30] you know who's what's going on with my
[1:32:33] headship something's off something's
[1:32:35] wrong
[1:32:36] you know
[1:32:37] but I'm so thankful that there was
[1:32:38] another Messenger on the scene as we go
[1:32:41] on through the story you find another
[1:32:43] messenger who was involved in all this
[1:32:45] who had insight to the meetings and had
[1:32:47] insight to the the responses from both
[1:32:49] sides
[1:32:51] he he goes and he finds Abigail this is
[1:32:55] Abigail's servant you know the servant
[1:32:57] is is sent to Abigail specifically amen
[1:33:00] with a word of warning hey something has
[1:33:03] happened your your flesh your headship
[1:33:06] has has made the wrong decision
[1:33:08] amen this servant was one of the the
[1:33:11] servants that received the message and
[1:33:12] he believed David's servants mentioned
[1:33:15] in the beginning that that the men there
[1:33:17] would be able to testify so here we find
[1:33:19] even how that in in the story how that
[1:33:22] The Messengers that David sent he says
[1:33:24] that those men will be able to testify
[1:33:26] of what we have said and done in this
[1:33:28] place
[1:33:29] you see
[1:33:31] he was there in the wilderness when
[1:33:33] David's men was protecting him he tasted
[1:33:35] of the goodness of David's rule
[1:33:37] interesting that one out of these
[1:33:39] Witnesses this servant actually goes
[1:33:42] directly to Abigail
[1:33:45] tells her of all that had taken place
[1:33:46] that her husband had rejected David and
[1:33:48] was unable to meet the needs of David
[1:33:51] tells her that her headship does not
[1:33:53] recognize who he was talking to and this
[1:33:55] is important this meant that they would
[1:33:57] be disconnected from David's protection
[1:34:00] and you know how Naval responded to his
[1:34:03] servants
[1:34:04] he railed upon them
[1:34:06] he didn't just you know
[1:34:11] say no he rails upon them
[1:34:14] what a headship
[1:34:16] the headship she was under not only
[1:34:17] didn't didn't recognize Who David really
[1:34:19] was but rails upon the servants and the
[1:34:22] scriptures tells us that he flew at them
[1:34:26] he flew upon them in other words he
[1:34:28] attacks the message Messengers
[1:34:32] and great Fury and in anger
[1:34:36] and this servant comes to Abigail and
[1:34:38] describes the experiences that he's had
[1:34:42] oh my you know I'm so glad that somebody
[1:34:45] came our way in the cool of the evening
[1:34:48] while all that was happening
[1:34:51] judgment was setting in
[1:34:53] oh think about it my brother and sister
[1:34:55] judgment was setting in on this thing
[1:34:57] because of a bad headship because of our
[1:35:00] circumstances but God sent us a message
[1:35:03] Amen to come and tell us what David had
[1:35:06] done become and tell us what Mabel is
[1:35:09] doing
[1:35:09] to come and tell us that the judgment is
[1:35:12] coming it's on the west coast you know
[1:35:14] these come to tell us you know that it's
[1:35:16] time to break out it's time to come out
[1:35:18] of these things
[1:35:20] that you're gonna die here if you don't
[1:35:22] do something
[1:35:23] judgment is coming
[1:35:26] he tells Abigail everything he discloses
[1:35:29] all the Plan of Redemption everything
[1:35:31] that was taking place
[1:35:33] oh my
[1:35:36] God he says as long
[1:35:39] as we were in conversant with them
[1:35:41] that's interesting as long as we were in
[1:35:44] other words in communion with David and
[1:35:45] his men
[1:35:47] as long as we walk together we were safe
[1:35:50] it starts to describe to her the kind of
[1:35:52] headship David brings when we were out
[1:35:55] there in the fields then the wolf came
[1:35:57] in there was there was the shepherd
[1:35:59] there was David the shepherd boy amen
[1:36:02] the Giant Slayer he was there in the
[1:36:04] fields you know as long as we were in
[1:36:06] communion with David everything was good
[1:36:08] we were safe
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:11] Oh my he was trying to tell Abigail
[1:36:13] Abigail you need this kind of headship
[1:36:15] you need to come under this kind of
[1:36:17] headship
[1:36:18] as long as we're walking with the word
[1:36:20] amen we're safe
[1:36:22] amen but as long as we're walking with
[1:36:24] Mabel we're not safe you're under that
[1:36:26] curse of judgment
[1:36:29] David was like those angels that were
[1:36:31] encamped about them
[1:36:33] amen you see they wouldn't bother them
[1:36:35] because they noticed whom they were
[1:36:37] walking with
[1:36:38] in other words they were safe as long as
[1:36:40] they were with the servants that were
[1:36:41] under the headship of David and this
[1:36:43] must have meant something to Abigail can
[1:36:45] you imagine Abigail living under this
[1:36:47] headship of Cruelty of severity with a
[1:36:51] heavy hand and you can see how he even
[1:36:53] treats servants can you imagine how he
[1:36:55] how he treated his own wife
[1:36:58] how we treated that little lady this
[1:37:00] little woman you know she was a
[1:37:02] beautiful little lady but look at how he
[1:37:04] didn't he didn't see that he didn't care
[1:37:05] that she was beautiful he didn't care
[1:37:07] that she was a woman of understanding
[1:37:09] that she was her father's Joy he didn't
[1:37:12] care he doesn't see that my brother and
[1:37:13] sister he only cares about himself and
[1:37:16] he's selfish and stubborn and severe
[1:37:20] he's churlish
[1:37:22] and here she's living in this situation
[1:37:23] can you imagine when this messenger came
[1:37:25] and told her about this headship that's
[1:37:27] coming told her about David's men and
[1:37:30] how it was to be in his presence how it
[1:37:34] was to be around his protectors they're
[1:37:36] on his Messengers how it was to be in
[1:37:38] the services that weekend
[1:37:40] Hallelujah
[1:37:44] oh that must have meant something to
[1:37:45] Abigail
[1:37:46] verse 16 goes on says they were they
[1:37:49] were a wall unto us
[1:37:51] both by night and by day
[1:37:54] protecting and defending them against
[1:37:56] the Philistines
[1:37:58] you see Abigail now in verse 17.
[1:38:01] the numbers are perfect amen
[1:38:03] verse 17 Abigail must make a decision
[1:38:07] because now the son of man has been
[1:38:09] revealed to her you know some there's
[1:38:11] been a revelation amen the messenger has
[1:38:14] come to tell her you know this is who
[1:38:15] you are and this is who navel is and
[1:38:17] this is Who David is here's the story
[1:38:19] and here's now you got to make a
[1:38:20] decision Abigail
[1:38:23] this is important because remember we
[1:38:25] could sit there under our headship of
[1:38:27] Flesh and blame and justify our
[1:38:29] condition
[1:38:31] on our flesh well my dad always was hot
[1:38:34] tempered so I'm hot tempered
[1:38:36] right and that's just too bad you know
[1:38:39] it's too bad David's coming I I don't
[1:38:41] know you know it's it's just too bad but
[1:38:43] I'm stuck
[1:38:45] you know we can make excuses for
[1:38:47] ourselves and go into a depression even
[1:38:49] allowing that flesh to govern our life
[1:38:51] and and and but you know my brother and
[1:38:53] sister Abigail made a decision
[1:38:57] you know Abigail unto this point she
[1:38:59] hasn't been been given the opportunity
[1:39:00] to have a say or to do anything for her
[1:39:03] situation you know she's done nothing
[1:39:06] but her headship has put her in this
[1:39:07] terrible situation because she was under
[1:39:10] him and because she was under him she
[1:39:13] would fall with him
[1:39:15] now consider now what you will do the
[1:39:18] Bible tells us consider now what you
[1:39:20] will do
[1:39:22] and I want to say that this morning
[1:39:24] consider now what you will do
[1:39:27] so much like Esther her actions would
[1:39:30] not only affect her
[1:39:32] but it would affect her household and
[1:39:34] her children
[1:39:36] the way she would respond in other words
[1:39:39] see Naval has had an opportunity but the
[1:39:42] way Abigail would respond would affect
[1:39:44] not just her but her family
[1:39:47] her household
[1:39:49] like Esther her response is she says he
[1:39:52] is such a son of Belial in other words
[1:39:54] she knows she recognizes her flesh as
[1:39:57] incapable of recognizing David that is
[1:40:00] so important my brother and sister we
[1:40:02] need to recognize this flesh our
[1:40:04] emotions our memories our feelings is
[1:40:07] unable just cast it aside
[1:40:11] just cast aside our flesh amen cast
[1:40:13] aside reasonings and doubts and fears
[1:40:16] this flesh is unable it's a son of the
[1:40:18] LIE
[1:40:20] which is to say he is worthless he is
[1:40:24] Lawless
[1:40:25] he's ill-natured it is not worth
[1:40:28] discussing anything with this man in
[1:40:31] other words Abigail realized it's not
[1:40:34] worth taking what she just heard back to
[1:40:37] her flesh her headship because she knew
[1:40:40] that headship cannot do the right thing
[1:40:44] so what what must she do
[1:40:47] what must Abigail do
[1:40:50] now
[1:40:52] after discussing this verse 18 we find
[1:40:55] out words like you know make haste
[1:40:56] quickly
[1:40:57] you know what must Abigail do who is who
[1:40:59] is Abigail what position does Abigail
[1:41:01] hold what influence does she have you
[1:41:04] might feel like you're just a little
[1:41:05] housewife somewhere or you know maybe
[1:41:07] you're just a janitor somewhere or
[1:41:09] you're the doormat at the church you
[1:41:11] know you might feel like you're just
[1:41:12] insignificant so what in what position
[1:41:14] what rights what what tools do I have
[1:41:19] oh brother uh Cadre was handing out two
[1:41:22] seventies last night
[1:41:24] amen
[1:41:27] you know God will equip you with just
[1:41:30] the right things he gave shamgar a
[1:41:31] Jawbone he gave David a sling you know
[1:41:34] he's given his bride the word
[1:41:36] you know just just take a look around
[1:41:38] take a look around in your life and just
[1:41:41] say Lord what have you given me
[1:41:43] Lord You're Here amen I want access to
[1:41:46] David I want access to his benefits I
[1:41:49] want access to his protection
[1:41:52] so Lord give me something that I can
[1:41:54] break free from my situation
[1:41:57] so what influence what can she do you
[1:42:00] know Abigail
[1:42:01] she was a woman of wisdom this is
[1:42:04] beautiful I love I love this
[1:42:06] because what does she do she quickly
[1:42:08] puts together food
[1:42:10] she puts food together you know you
[1:42:12] might say what is that you know there's
[1:42:13] 400 trained men coming what's she gonna
[1:42:16] do with food
[1:42:18] you know judgment has been declared
[1:42:19] what's he going to do with food what is
[1:42:21] that anyway you know what what is this
[1:42:24] what kind of an approach is this but see
[1:42:26] Abigail knew the desire of David's heart
[1:42:29] isn't that amazing
[1:42:32] that she knew he was looking for
[1:42:34] substance
[1:42:35] he was looking for food amen where the
[1:42:38] Eagles that gathered there the carcasses
[1:42:39] amen it's all about the food amen the
[1:42:44] word
[1:42:45] oh my it's all about the word my brother
[1:42:47] and sister so she already instinctively
[1:42:50] something inside of her tells her David
[1:42:52] is wanting food
[1:42:55] so she quickly puts food together in
[1:42:57] wine and corn prepares everything to
[1:43:00] give to David and his men she's going to
[1:43:01] meet an army in the time of judgment
[1:43:05] with food
[1:43:07] that's how we meet our Lord and savior
[1:43:09] my brother and sister is with the word
[1:43:10] of God Amen as God is moving in and we
[1:43:13] see judgments sweeping and we see the
[1:43:15] chaos in this world we see all those
[1:43:17] things we see how this world is again
[1:43:19] falling apart again and again and again
[1:43:21] over and over and we see judgment taking
[1:43:23] its toll my brother and sister but in
[1:43:26] that time there's a bride who has food
[1:43:28] who's going to meet David
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:32] oh my the key here is that she can
[1:43:35] respond to David's call but she's still
[1:43:37] stuck under the headship of Mabel
[1:43:41] oh my
[1:43:43] you see even though our emotions may say
[1:43:45] something our feelings may say something
[1:43:48] my brother and sister Reach Out
[1:43:50] you might be under the wrong headship
[1:43:52] this morning but you have every right to
[1:43:54] reach out to God
[1:43:57] don't talk it over with your flesh just
[1:44:00] make a move towards God gather what
[1:44:03] you've got pick up the pieces of your
[1:44:05] life and bring it to David
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:09] see whether she was in the right
[1:44:11] position or not she wasn't concerned
[1:44:13] about the politics and things like that
[1:44:14] whether she was allowed to or not
[1:44:16] remember Esther even she says even
[1:44:19] though I know it's not lawful
[1:44:22] but she knew the blessings was there in
[1:44:24] the throne room
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:27] she responds
[1:44:32] she sends a messenger ahead of her
[1:44:34] son's praying in other words huh she
[1:44:37] sends a messenger ahead of her and does
[1:44:39] not even mention this happening to to
[1:44:42] nabel
[1:44:43] you see she has changed now she she
[1:44:45] recognizes what's happening and she she
[1:44:48] realizes you know that navel cannot make
[1:44:50] the right decision for her
[1:44:52] that it's it's bad it's all bad
[1:44:55] so she's not interested in nabel's
[1:44:58] opinion anymore
[1:45:00] amen she's not interested in his opinion
[1:45:02] the blessings in David
[1:45:05] your freedom is in David right who cares
[1:45:07] about what the flesh is saying amen she
[1:45:10] knew where she stood in this she was
[1:45:11] interested in that request that David
[1:45:13] made she was interested because she was
[1:45:15] not just saving herself but she'd be
[1:45:18] saving her house
[1:45:19] now here's just a little side note just
[1:45:22] something free for all of you sisters if
[1:45:25] you want to calm a warrior down if you
[1:45:28] want to bring a warrior an angry person
[1:45:30] down from his his high horse just make
[1:45:33] him some food
[1:45:35] hey man all the brothers said amen
[1:45:40] amen just create an atmosphere this is
[1:45:44] the bride's weapons
[1:45:46] huh you see this is what we've been
[1:45:48] given we're a bride for a reason God's
[1:45:51] not looking for a prophet God's not
[1:45:53] looking for for a great Army in the end
[1:45:55] time he's raised up his little bride and
[1:45:57] what does she do she's good at
[1:45:58] Fellowship she's good at preparing food
[1:46:01] amen why because that creates an
[1:46:04] atmosphere the word creates an
[1:46:06] atmosphere that brings our children in
[1:46:09] it calms down the Judgment amen do we
[1:46:11] have a place of Refuge in those times
[1:46:13] amen well judgment is out there we have
[1:46:16] a place of safety why because of the
[1:46:18] food that's been given to the bride
[1:46:20] thank you
[1:46:22] [Applause]
[1:46:23] now here for the first time Abigail
[1:46:25] would come to meet David face to face
[1:46:29] oh it's so beautiful
[1:46:31] like Sodom and Gomorrah in the end times
[1:46:33] right before the destruction there's a
[1:46:36] meeting that takes place
[1:46:38] comes face to face they've had God
[1:46:40] unveiling himself amen
[1:46:44] Hallelujah I hope you appreciate what
[1:46:46] God's done in our day for us
[1:46:51] like the wedding of the bride and groom
[1:46:54] oh my right before that there's a
[1:46:56] there's a meeting that takes place
[1:46:59] in Heavenly places
[1:47:01] verse 21 goes on says David realizes
[1:47:04] that he doesn't it doesn't matter what
[1:47:06] he has done for nabel it just doesn't
[1:47:08] matter because the flesh cannot
[1:47:10] recognize it the navel has rejected him
[1:47:13] insulted him made fun of him mocked him
[1:47:18] all of his Good Deeds his protection and
[1:47:20] his care for navel has been rejected His
[1:47:23] Kind message and Messengers have been
[1:47:25] rejected repaid him with with not just
[1:47:27] rejecting him but repaid him with evil
[1:47:29] turning against him
[1:47:31] verse 23 Abigail's approach now she had
[1:47:35] a very different approach to David than
[1:47:38] Abel when she saw him she immediately
[1:47:40] came to him
[1:47:43] when she saw him
[1:47:45] she runs to him
[1:47:47] she makes her way to him she's not
[1:47:49] sending a messenger anymore she doesn't
[1:47:51] want anybody in between she wants to
[1:47:54] meet David
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:47:56] and I thank God for The Messengers but
[1:47:59] she wants to meet David
[1:48:01] amen so she runs to him when she saw him
[1:48:04] she immediately comes to him like
[1:48:06] Rebecca to Isaac comes to him showing
[1:48:08] him reverence and respect bowing herself
[1:48:11] before him
[1:48:13] and Abigail speaks
[1:48:16] verse 24.
[1:48:18] I love that Abigail speaks
[1:48:22] whatsoever you say huh
[1:48:25] he says upon me
[1:48:27] my Lord upon me let this iniquity be
[1:48:33] and let thine handmade I pray they speak
[1:48:35] in thine audience and hear the words of
[1:48:37] thine handmaid look at her approach now
[1:48:40] this is beautiful
[1:48:41] because it's showing the character of
[1:48:44] Abigail
[1:48:45] who is US amen
[1:48:47] Abigail could have said oh David I'm so
[1:48:50] glad I finally I met you but you know
[1:48:52] this this husband of mine he's you know
[1:48:54] he's this and he's that and my flesh
[1:48:57] does this and that and all the mistakes
[1:48:58] and you know it's just terrible and
[1:49:00] start start laying out all the things no
[1:49:02] she doesn't do that she doesn't try to
[1:49:04] justify herself or try to isolate
[1:49:06] herself from her her husband or anything
[1:49:08] like that no she comes and and she says
[1:49:10] let all the the iniquity
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:13] now she didn't do it her husband did it
[1:49:16] but she recognized the headship she was
[1:49:18] under amen and so she says let all that
[1:49:20] iniquity be let it be upon me in other
[1:49:23] words like Jesus Christ let me take the
[1:49:25] brunt of the Judgment into my person
[1:49:28] so that my family can be safe
[1:49:31] see he was David when he saw that like
[1:49:35] God looking at Moses when Moses stood in
[1:49:37] the gap for his people
[1:49:38] God sees a reflection of himself
[1:49:41] [Music]
[1:49:43] this is what's in the bride
[1:49:46] we're not trying to justify ourself
[1:49:47] we're not we're not trying to fuss with
[1:49:50] this and trying to you know make out
[1:49:52] make ourselves look good or any of these
[1:49:54] things would you say Lord let the sins
[1:49:56] of my family be upon me why because we
[1:49:58] want to apply a token Lord I want to
[1:50:00] create an atmosphere of love and mercy
[1:50:03] like you did for me Lord
[1:50:06] can you imagine David in in the mode of
[1:50:09] judgment and this woman comes and Bows
[1:50:11] before him
[1:50:14] with his sword and Shields and 400 men
[1:50:18] and this woman comes and takes the whole
[1:50:19] what is he supposed to do now this woman
[1:50:23] a woman
[1:50:25] don't underestimate yourself sisters a
[1:50:28] woman stood between an army
[1:50:32] and her family
[1:50:35] [Applause]
[1:50:40] foreign
[1:50:43] you know as we're right in this moment
[1:50:45] we're right in this moment right before
[1:50:47] judgment sets in where we have an
[1:50:49] audience with the Lord
[1:50:51] just like Abraham an audience
[1:50:53] with the Lord
[1:50:55] to ask for
[1:50:57] salvation for our families
[1:51:01] stand in the gap
[1:51:02] how many stories do we need to see for
[1:51:05] us to recognize this is truly our
[1:51:07] position as the bride of Christ
[1:51:09] see I'm thankful God saved me but he
[1:51:11] saved us for a purpose
[1:51:13] you might say brother Chris I'm the only
[1:51:15] one in my family serving the lord
[1:51:18] well that's like Esther
[1:51:20] that's like Abigail
[1:51:22] amen it's like so many others in the
[1:51:24] Bible that's like Ruth
[1:51:26] amen that's like Rahab
[1:51:29] that's like able
[1:51:31] God God raises somebody to stand in the
[1:51:35] gap for the family
[1:51:37] just like Jesus Christ came into the
[1:51:39] world
[1:51:40] for his family
[1:51:43] amen it's the same nature of Christ that
[1:51:45] is in the bride today why else do you
[1:51:47] think it gave us the weapons to destroy
[1:51:49] our enemies to speak the word why do you
[1:51:52] think the third poll one of the the
[1:51:54] greatest manifestations of the third
[1:51:56] poll my brother and sister is salvation
[1:51:58] for family members
[1:52:01] it's not for riches
[1:52:04] Abigail right in the position right
[1:52:06] before David
[1:52:09] let the iniquity be upon me
[1:52:12] she takes the blame for her husband's
[1:52:15] actions showing her unconditional care
[1:52:17] and love for her household see sometimes
[1:52:20] we feel like well if I take the blame
[1:52:21] and this situation it's going to look
[1:52:23] like I'm the one that's at fault
[1:52:25] but David knows
[1:52:27] David knows who's really to blame he
[1:52:30] knows it's your flesh
[1:52:31] huh
[1:52:33] but you need to come and confess him
[1:52:35] amen
[1:52:38] David knows you know and I want to
[1:52:40] encourage you daddies and husbands and
[1:52:42] so forth you know sometimes something
[1:52:44] will happen in a relationship or in a
[1:52:46] home or in a church
[1:52:48] but you know you're the high priest of
[1:52:49] the home for a reason
[1:52:51] no one else in that household can play
[1:52:54] that part
[1:52:55] it's up to us Brothers to sometimes say
[1:52:57] you know what the fault is here right at
[1:52:59] the headship
[1:53:00] the fault is here this situation is like
[1:53:02] this because of me gather your family
[1:53:04] around and play the priesthood part save
[1:53:07] the family men do the right thing
[1:53:10] sometimes it's better to just take the
[1:53:12] Lower Road and say you know what this is
[1:53:14] my fault
[1:53:15] you know let's let's reason one with
[1:53:17] another let's gather together let's why
[1:53:19] because you're interested in Saving the
[1:53:20] family
[1:53:21] you know you're not interested in your
[1:53:23] reputation you're not interested in your
[1:53:25] name you're interested in Salvation
[1:53:27] you're interested in restoration so
[1:53:30] sometimes we got to take a lower Road my
[1:53:32] brother and sister why because we have
[1:53:33] someone's life we have someone's soul in
[1:53:35] mind
[1:53:37] we're not taking our reputations with us
[1:53:39] we're taking our families with us
[1:53:42] [Applause]
[1:53:44] oh I love Abigail I love that she could
[1:53:47] do that
[1:53:50] give us strength Lord
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:54] hey
[1:53:56] so she admits the dire condition of her
[1:53:59] headship to David she says let not my
[1:54:00] Lord I pray they regard this man of
[1:54:02] Belial even nabel for as his name is so
[1:54:05] is he nabel is his name and Folly is
[1:54:08] with him
[1:54:10] but I thine handmaid so not the men the
[1:54:14] young men of my Lord whom now did send
[1:54:17] in other words I wasn't there Lord
[1:54:19] before the foundation of the world and I
[1:54:22] I was there but I don't remember
[1:54:24] you know there's this there's this
[1:54:26] there's all these conversations where
[1:54:27] she's catching up
[1:54:29] she's catching up right she's finding
[1:54:31] out what really happened in these
[1:54:33] conversations and she's saying I wasn't
[1:54:35] there and in other words if I was there
[1:54:37] at that moment
[1:54:39] I might have been able to influence them
[1:54:41] to do the right thing
[1:54:43] but see that's our flesh
[1:54:47] our flesh cannot see it she says I did
[1:54:51] not see it
[1:54:54] if I had only been there I could have
[1:54:56] persuaded him
[1:54:57] I did not see it
[1:55:00] that's our flesh for you
[1:55:03] her headship should have been able to
[1:55:04] see it
[1:55:05] right but he didn't
[1:55:09] then she identifies herself as your
[1:55:11] handmaid
[1:55:13] what is what is a handmaid
[1:55:16] it's not a servant
[1:55:17] a handmaid is a lady in waiting
[1:55:21] so what's she telling David
[1:55:23] she's saying David I'm Bound by a law to
[1:55:27] another husband
[1:55:28] and because of that law
[1:55:30] I can't do anything about it
[1:55:33] I can't go home and just kill him
[1:55:37] oh why are you laughing
[1:55:41] you know because he needs to be dead
[1:55:45] remember this now she's stuck my brother
[1:55:47] and sister she's stuck because of the
[1:55:50] law
[1:55:51] but she he needs to be dead for her to
[1:55:54] go to another headship there's no other
[1:55:56] way there's no other way to cut it and
[1:55:59] it wouldn't help if she went and
[1:56:01] murdered her own husband that would just
[1:56:03] make things worse you see so she needed
[1:56:06] somebody greater than her
[1:56:08] to intervene in the situation but look
[1:56:11] how she when she comes to David she's
[1:56:13] respectful and she says you know I'm not
[1:56:15] running off with you David right we're
[1:56:17] not going to elope in other words
[1:56:19] but David I am in waiting
[1:56:23] in other words I'll wait
[1:56:25] until God has done something I'm going
[1:56:28] to stay at the altar I'm going to wait
[1:56:30] on the Lord to to make the difference
[1:56:33] amen and my brother and sister if you're
[1:56:35] going through a hard relationship excuse
[1:56:39] me or a marriage or something
[1:56:42] just just get quiet before the Lord
[1:56:45] amen God God will intervene for you you
[1:56:49] know the unbelieving husband is saved by
[1:56:51] the believing wife and so forth you know
[1:56:53] just carry on in your in your duties as
[1:56:55] a wife and in the kitchen and and the
[1:56:58] things that you do with your children
[1:56:59] and you create an atmosphere you're a
[1:57:01] lady in waiting
[1:57:03] because God will do something for your
[1:57:05] situation like you did for Abigail just
[1:57:08] say Lord I'm Abigail Lord I need I need
[1:57:11] a change of headship change my husband's
[1:57:13] hearts
[1:57:13] [Applause]
[1:57:16] sometimes we want the easy way out but
[1:57:19] Abigail says she was a woman of
[1:57:20] understanding of wisdom she's not
[1:57:23] looking for the easy way out she knows
[1:57:24] that there needs to be a death and she's
[1:57:27] willing to wait for the for the for this
[1:57:30] experience
[1:57:33] like the Chicago Rancho story waiting
[1:57:36] for him to come home
[1:57:37] she doesn't call him you know a runaway
[1:57:40] servant
[1:57:41] because that's what nabel was accusing
[1:57:43] him of that he was a runaway servant he
[1:57:46] was trying to get away from Saul and you
[1:57:48] know who does he think he is and you
[1:57:50] know she doesn't do any of that
[1:57:52] but rather she calls him
[1:57:55] Lord
[1:57:57] she calls him Lord
[1:57:59] like the Pharisees that called Jesus a
[1:58:02] devil and yet he was their lord
[1:58:05] Abigail notices a change now in David's
[1:58:08] countenance I don't know maybe he was
[1:58:09] smelling the bacon or you know maybe the
[1:58:12] the chicken that was roasting I don't
[1:58:15] know
[1:58:15] but you know something changed in
[1:58:17] David's countenance
[1:58:19] that's this is amazing because you know
[1:58:21] my brother and sister where when we
[1:58:22] approached God where he should have been
[1:58:24] a god of wrath and judgment that's what
[1:58:27] brother Branham said he always thought
[1:58:28] that God was was angry and you know but
[1:58:30] you know that's when when you come into
[1:58:32] His presence and you start talking to
[1:58:34] him and you start communing with him and
[1:58:37] he would confess your sins to him and
[1:58:39] you repent to him what happens that his
[1:58:41] countenance starts to change Hallelujah
[1:58:49] David came there with one intent
[1:58:53] now she is seeing a change in his
[1:58:55] countenance he's looking at her
[1:58:57] his words are catching his heart
[1:59:01] see it's all about
[1:59:02] our words
[1:59:05] as the Lord liveth she says
[1:59:08] and as thy soul liveth
[1:59:11] see she touches on something that gets
[1:59:13] his attention
[1:59:15] and she says something before he even
[1:59:17] reacts she says God has held you from
[1:59:21] shedding blood
[1:59:26] God in other words she said she is
[1:59:29] recognizing that David God has done
[1:59:32] something between you and I
[1:59:35] God has has held you from shedding
[1:59:38] innocent blood
[1:59:40] in other words David's coming on the
[1:59:42] scene and and in this mode of judgment
[1:59:44] there's this mystery lady that he hadn't
[1:59:46] he hadn't quite noticed just yet
[1:59:49] she hasn't come to the Forefront in the
[1:59:51] story just yet you know because he's in
[1:59:53] judgment mode and and there's this
[1:59:55] little lady and if he had to judge the
[1:59:57] house he would have destroyed Abigail
[1:59:59] with her
[2:00:00] just like we find in the story of Moses
[2:00:03] that if God had to destroy those people
[2:00:04] who knows who all he would have
[2:00:06] destroyed maybe Joshua and Caleb was
[2:00:08] already on the scene and we wouldn't
[2:00:09] have those stories of Joshua and Caleb
[2:00:11] but see there's that mystery that's
[2:00:13] there and Abigail's the one that comes
[2:00:15] on the scene and changes us all around
[2:00:17] and changes his countenance and she
[2:00:19] recognizes and tells David that God has
[2:00:22] done something between us
[2:00:24] it's same as we can say it this morning
[2:00:26] God you have done something between us
[2:00:29] [Music]
[2:00:31] God has done something between us in
[2:00:33] other words God has brought us together
[2:00:35] like this with food here in our midst
[2:00:39] and she gives him her gifts in verse 28
[2:00:41] she opens her heart to David
[2:00:44] put verse 28 up
[2:00:46] says I pray thee forgive the sins of
[2:00:50] thine handmaid
[2:00:54] for the Lord will certainly make my Lord
[2:00:56] a sure house
[2:00:58] because my Lord fighteth the battles of
[2:01:01] the Lord look at this beautiful language
[2:01:04] huh
[2:01:05] and evil hath not been found in thee all
[2:01:08] thy days
[2:01:10] she knew something about David
[2:01:13] are you can imagine how this moved on
[2:01:15] David she's recognizing him as her Lord
[2:01:18] and she connects him with the Lord I
[2:01:20] mean what an incredible connection that
[2:01:24] she makes with David
[2:01:26] a sure house
[2:01:29] the parallels between Jesus Christ here
[2:01:31] are incredible
[2:01:32] and David the languages of my Lord and
[2:01:35] and the Lord Capital owl verse 29 and
[2:01:38] says yet a man is risen to pursue thee
[2:01:42] and to seek thy soul but the soul of my
[2:01:45] Lord shall be bound in the bundle of
[2:01:47] life with the Lord thy God
[2:01:51] and The Souls of thine enemies them
[2:01:54] shall he sling out as out of the middle
[2:01:56] of a sling
[2:01:59] you know David right there as she said
[2:02:01] sling
[2:02:03] he remembered Goliath
[2:02:06] he remembered God in his life
[2:02:09] he remembered how God had orchestrated
[2:02:11] his very life and the God had fought his
[2:02:14] battles for him and how that his soul
[2:02:16] was bound in the bundle of in a bundle
[2:02:19] of life with the Lord of God you know
[2:02:22] can you imagine that's exactly what
[2:02:23] Abigail wanted she wanted not to be
[2:02:25] bound by this law of this husband
[2:02:26] because she wanted to be bound in the
[2:02:29] bundle of life
[2:02:37] praise the Lord oh David had she had
[2:02:40] David's attention
[2:02:42] she knew about David sling
[2:02:44] she knew about David's life
[2:02:47] amen she she knew about David
[2:02:50] and it shall come to pass in verse 30
[2:02:52] and when the Lord shall have done to my
[2:02:54] Lord according to all the good that he
[2:02:57] had spoken concerning thee and shall
[2:02:59] have appointed the ruler over Israel
[2:03:03] I mean she is prophesying she is she is
[2:03:06] speaking the word to David I mean she's
[2:03:09] speaking what Samuel spoke
[2:03:14] see the word was in Abigail the word
[2:03:17] that was in Samuel was now coming out of
[2:03:19] Abigail's mouth
[2:03:22] praise the Lord
[2:03:24] that this shall be no grief unto thee in
[2:03:27] verse 31 no nor offense of Hearts unto
[2:03:30] my Lord neither that thou Hast shed
[2:03:33] blood causeless or that my Lord hath
[2:03:35] Avenged himself but when the Lord shall
[2:03:38] have dealt well with my Lord then
[2:03:40] remember thine handmade in other words
[2:03:42] when you come into your position
[2:03:43] remember me
[2:03:46] just like the thief on the cross
[2:03:48] amen remember me
[2:03:51] your lady and waiting Remember Me Lord
[2:03:55] oh my
[2:03:57] remember her situation now her
[2:03:59] oppression
[2:04:00] and she says when you are king and have
[2:04:03] authority and resources remember me
[2:04:07] Jesus reply was this day shall you see
[2:04:10] me in Paradise amen
[2:04:13] Jesus said it's expedient that I go to
[2:04:15] the father then he goes and he sits on
[2:04:16] the throne and sends back the Holy Ghost
[2:04:18] amen verse 32 says blessed be the Lord
[2:04:21] God for sending you to me this day
[2:04:26] Imagine David rejoicing because of
[2:04:29] Abigail
[2:04:31] now remember David's gone through an
[2:04:33] experience as well he's lost a wife also
[2:04:36] huh
[2:04:38] he's also lost a wife
[2:04:39] and he and here he is and and this woman
[2:04:42] comes to him and he says blessed art
[2:04:43] thou for coming to me this day
[2:04:46] amen something's happening he's excited
[2:04:48] he's happy amen and he thanks her from
[2:04:52] for from keeping him from shedding
[2:04:54] innocent blood
[2:04:57] verse 35 says so David received of her
[2:05:00] hand that which he had brought which she
[2:05:01] had brought him and said unto her go up
[2:05:04] in peace to thine house
[2:05:06] see I have hearkened to thy voice
[2:05:10] and have accepted thy person
[2:05:14] not just heard her voice but he accepted
[2:05:17] Abigail
[2:05:19] now Abigail is under the wrong headship
[2:05:23] but her voice crying out from under that
[2:05:25] headship
[2:05:26] caught David's attention
[2:05:28] and the voice responds and he says you
[2:05:30] have found favor with me not just your
[2:05:33] voice
[2:05:34] right like the prophet says our voice
[2:05:36] crying out from the front behind the
[2:05:38] blood he cannot see us but but he hears
[2:05:40] a voice
[2:05:42] and then he says I have accepted thy
[2:05:44] person
[2:05:46] think of what he's saying he's accepted
[2:05:48] her
[2:05:49] Oh my he in other words it is to say
[2:05:51] that he has elevated her from her status
[2:05:54] from her situation Abigail I I see your
[2:05:58] need is what he's saying that you have
[2:06:00] found favor in my eyes I I'm gonna
[2:06:02] sheath the sword go in peace I'm going
[2:06:06] to elevate you you're elevated in my
[2:06:08] presence
[2:06:08] [Applause]
[2:06:11] he's going to lift her up into Heavenly
[2:06:13] places I've accepted come up higher
[2:06:15] where I am amen come out from this this
[2:06:18] Despair and this headship that you're in
[2:06:21] that brother and sister what a beautiful
[2:06:23] response from David I have accepted thy
[2:06:25] person
[2:06:29] I've received your gift
[2:06:31] and when we sing praises unto the Lord
[2:06:33] and we come here and we worship so
[2:06:35] appreciate our brother Isaac and the way
[2:06:37] he worships and just creates an
[2:06:38] atmosphere and God receives our Gifts of
[2:06:41] worship amen and there he has forgiven
[2:06:44] her and made her free from any guilt
[2:06:48] hello
[2:06:49] and yet the flash is there
[2:06:52] he hasn't changed his opinion
[2:06:56] huh he hasn't changed his opinion
[2:06:59] we don't find Abigail going home and
[2:07:00] telling you know nabel about everything
[2:07:02] and and oh that's so nice Abigail
[2:07:05] right how sweet
[2:07:07] right no oh this guy is evil
[2:07:12] he's churlish severe
[2:07:15] and she knows this
[2:07:17] but she has a promise now right
[2:07:20] she has a promise she's heard directly
[2:07:23] from David this is not through a
[2:07:25] messenger anymore this is personal she's
[2:07:27] heard directly he said Shalom to me amen
[2:07:32] when he unveiled himself the first thing
[2:07:34] he said was peace be unto your house
[2:07:36] my house not just me but my house if you
[2:07:40] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ die in
[2:07:41] thy house shall be saved absolutely amen
[2:07:44] I'm just telling you what the word says
[2:07:46] amen oh but my family this I'll enable
[2:07:49] this and and and he didn't do the right
[2:07:51] thing in this oh no he said
[2:07:53] peace be unto you
[2:07:58] this to be free from any guilt he's
[2:08:00] literally telling her that I have lifted
[2:08:03] thy face
[2:08:04] [Music]
[2:08:07] now verse 36 is where it gets really
[2:08:09] really good now we're now we're getting

[2:13:21] out of his Slumber and his partying and
[2:13:24] and unaware of of his of what has
[2:13:26] happened and he starts to kind of you

[2:13:42] been with his mighty men we've been with
[2:13:44] his Messengers oh let me tell you nabel
[2:13:46] of what what David has told me

[2:14:29] you know he's a runaway and he's this
[2:14:31] and that and look at all the mistakes

[2:14:38] she saw she saw his weapons she saw his
[2:14:41] sword amen she saw his shield she knows
[2:14:44] what's coming because she's been given a

[2:16:01] faith and you're in trouble man
[2:16:04] huh you're in big trouble he's coming
[2:16:07] huh the the Rangers coming
[2:16:13] Hallelujah
[2:16:16] and as she starts to confess the word
[2:16:18] ask your stars to confess the promise
[2:16:22] something changes
[2:16:25] let's turn over to Navel now Naval is
[2:16:28] hearing Abigail's revelation
[2:16:32] and the Bible tells us that his heart
[2:16:34] died
[2:16:35] within him
[2:16:38] I love that Nable did not have to that
[2:16:40] Abigail did not have to do anything to
[2:16:43] nabel she just had to wait and trust in
[2:16:46] the Lord
[2:16:48] but Mabel's heart died within him in
[2:16:52] other words something suddenly changed
[2:16:54] because before Naval might have hit her
[2:16:58] huh he might have put her under his
[2:17:00] thumb and tried to bring her to
[2:17:02] submission Abigail who are you kidding
[2:17:05] you're not worthy David doesn't like you
[2:17:08] you know nothing you're stuck with me
[2:17:10] you know he could have he could have
[2:17:12] tried to bring her under subjection
[2:17:13] again and and our flesh can do that
[2:17:17] by memories or whatever but you see
[2:17:19] something different was happening now
[2:17:23] amen I'm so thankful amen the Bible
[2:17:26] tells us that he became as a stone
[2:17:28] in other words with her new revelation
[2:17:31] with her understanding of who she was to
[2:17:35] David
[2:17:36] he became unresponsive
[2:17:41] your flesh literally like like a brother
[2:17:43] was saying you know we don't have we we
[2:17:45] don't have the desire for sin
[2:17:47] this flesh just we don't have a desire
[2:17:50] for it it's unresponsive
[2:17:53] it's become a stone
[2:17:55] in other words he became senseless he
[2:17:58] had he had no ability to influence her
[2:18:01] anymore
[2:18:03] [Music]
[2:18:04] he was not being able to react he's not
[2:18:08] able to react to what she's saying
[2:18:11] he hears the message of peace and
[2:18:13] long-suffering and salvation he doesn't
[2:18:16] know what to do with that in other words
[2:18:17] he has been made powerless
[2:18:20] in the presence of the word but I want
[2:18:22] you to notice this Abigail's words that
[2:18:24] is making him powerless
[2:18:26] this this bride will have a Ministry my
[2:18:29] brother and sister at the end time and
[2:18:30] that enemy will be made powerless in her
[2:18:33] presence
[2:18:35] [Applause]
[2:18:38] powerless
[2:18:40] powerless by Abigail's confession
[2:18:44] you know this is important because we're
[2:18:46] leaving camp
[2:18:48] are we gonna go home we're going to go
[2:18:50] to school we're going to go to work go
[2:18:52] to all these places and your flesh is
[2:18:53] going to rile up remember me right this
[2:18:57] habit that feeling this that just
[2:18:59] confess the word just speak the word
[2:19:02] speak the word you'll see that that
[2:19:04] enemy will become powerless he won't
[2:19:06] know how to react to you he'll he'll
[2:19:07] wonder what has happened to you
[2:19:11] Hallelujah but he's not dead yet
[2:19:15] but he's powerless
[2:19:18] I love this
[2:19:20] you see a headship that was taking
[2:19:22] Abigail to certain death has now been
[2:19:25] made powerless over her in other words
[2:19:28] the the grip of death
[2:19:30] the the Paws Of The Lion and the bear
[2:19:32] have been removed from Abigail's life
[2:19:37] the Bible tells us that the Lord smote
[2:19:39] nabel
[2:19:40] 10 days later
[2:19:43] and nabel was dead
[2:19:48] can you say that navel is dead
[2:19:53] amen you see God
[2:19:56] saw Abigail's need
[2:19:58] he had a Warrior come on the scene he
[2:20:00] had Messengers come on the scene but God
[2:20:02] was waiting for Abigail to take the word
[2:20:05] and speak it to her need
[2:20:08] whatsoever you say then
[2:20:12] okay you ask anything in my name
[2:20:14] believing it shall be given
[2:20:17] he's waiting for you to say it
[2:20:19] and then God makes that enemy powerless
[2:20:22] in our lives and you know she may have
[2:20:24] walked Pastor a few times during the
[2:20:26] week
[2:20:28] can you imagine this guy that was cruel
[2:20:31] that was severe and she would come into
[2:20:33] His presence and maybe kind of hunk her
[2:20:36] a little bit you know just not knowing
[2:20:37] how he's going to respond or what he's
[2:20:38] going to do and living fear in her whole
[2:20:41] life like that and but now you know
[2:20:42] because of her confession she was
[2:20:44] becoming stronger
[2:20:46] she could walk into his room and he'd
[2:20:48] still be there
[2:20:49] like he was saying like a mannequin
[2:20:52] you would still be there just speechless
[2:20:54] nothing to say just a stone
[2:20:58] and she would maybe go up to him and
[2:21:00] poke him a little bit
[2:21:03] you know
[2:21:04] man that desire of smoking where is it
[2:21:07] gone
[2:21:09] huh
[2:21:10] that desire for drinking where's it gone
[2:21:12] or remove movies whatever it may be my
[2:21:15] brother and sister you know you know
[2:21:16] what I'm talking about this morning but
[2:21:18] you know that it's gone maybe maybe you
[2:21:20] know you just walked past him one day
[2:21:22] and just give him a little shove huh
[2:21:27] it's powerless
[2:21:30] you know
[2:21:32] maybe she would maybe she would start to
[2:21:35] realize what's happening and and bring
[2:21:37] her children you know bring her servants
[2:21:40] and her family and say hey I want to
[2:21:42] show you guys something we're going to
[2:21:43] go to church today I want to show you
[2:21:45] something amen hallelujah amen our
[2:21:49] enemy's dead that that headship that I
[2:21:52] was bound to that's oppressive thing
[2:21:55] that was holding me under that he's dead
[2:21:58] he's unresponsive
[2:22:00] he's senseless
[2:22:03] you know I can walk right up to him and
[2:22:05] say something and and he just stares
[2:22:07] into Abyss
[2:22:09] just nothing there
[2:22:11] huh
[2:22:13] praise the Lord she must be she must
[2:22:16] have been having a jubilee
[2:22:18] amen and then her her mind starts to
[2:22:21] turn heavenward
[2:22:23] oh my because now she's free
[2:22:25] now she's free to go and and marry this
[2:22:29] one this one who brought protection her
[2:22:31] whole life I want you to remember that
[2:22:33] while Abigail was under those
[2:22:35] circumstances David was protecting her
[2:22:37] also
[2:22:39] all our lives he has been faithful
[2:22:42] [Applause]
[2:22:43] [Music]
[2:22:44] but there Comes A Time my brother and
[2:22:46] sister where he doesn't want to just
[2:22:47] protect us from afar he doesn't want to
[2:22:50] just you know set a hedge around us no
[2:22:52] he wants to walk with you
[2:22:54] isn't that exactly what he did with the
[2:22:55] prophet he said he welcomed him back
[2:22:57] into that storm in his life and he said
[2:23:00] come back into the storm and he and he
[2:23:02] speaks to that storm and then after a
[2:23:04] little while he says he started to feel
[2:23:05] young again
[2:23:06] huh and he said he found a hand on him
[2:23:09] and he says you're walking with the King
[2:23:12] [Music]
[2:23:14] that's what he wants to do with you and
[2:23:16] me my brothers
[2:23:21] and citizenship with you he wants to be
[2:23:23] your headship
[2:23:25] amen my brown sister this headship
[2:23:27] brings all the benefits
[2:23:29] it brings protection it's it brings all
[2:23:32] the the necessary food that we have need
[2:23:35] on for for our journey
[2:23:38] it brings peace
[2:23:40] brings Joy
[2:23:43] and he's going to be king one day
[2:23:46] [Music]
[2:23:46] [Applause]
[2:23:49] oh I just love the story of Abigail
[2:23:51] [Music]
[2:23:53] we find in the next little bit here how
[2:23:55] David proposes see Catch the sequence
[2:23:57] now David's first wife Michael or
[2:24:00] Michelle however you say that was taken
[2:24:04] from him to be given to another
[2:24:07] so Abigail
[2:24:09] comes on the scene at this that's why I
[2:24:12] say the timing of all of this is so
[2:24:13] incredible
[2:24:16] is to give us confidence this morning
[2:24:18] David's available
[2:24:21] David is looking for a wife
[2:24:23] and you're available
[2:24:26] amen God's taking care of all those
[2:24:28] issues he's taking care of the flesh
[2:24:31] he's taking care of the law
[2:24:34] David's first wife given to another and
[2:24:36] Abigail's husband dies made powerless
[2:24:38] over her David immediately turns to her
[2:24:41] and sends her Messengers
[2:24:43] Messengers that tells her of David's
[2:24:45] intentions towards her and in the words
[2:24:48] of the Scripture it says that David sent
[2:24:50] and communed with Abigail
[2:24:54] in this communion phase of our walk with
[2:24:57] the Lord amen and he communes with her
[2:25:00] to let her know that he is coming to
[2:25:01] take her to be his wife
[2:25:05] verse 40 says and when the Servants of
[2:25:07] David were come to Abigail to Carmel
[2:25:09] they spake unto her saying David sent on
[2:25:12] sent us unto thee to take thee to him to
[2:25:16] wife
[2:25:18] and she arose and bowed her head herself
[2:25:21] on her face to the Earth about herself
[2:25:25] on her face to the Earth and said behold
[2:25:27] let thine handmade be a servant to wash
[2:25:29] the feet of the Servants of my Lord
[2:25:32] oh she was happy
[2:25:33] she was rejoicing remember the woman
[2:25:36] that lost Jesus feet
[2:25:38] why because of that defeat of Jesus
[2:25:39] remember it's under those feet where
[2:25:41] every enemy is crushed
[2:25:44] feet of breath we said oh my brother and
[2:25:46] sister feet of pillar is a fire there's
[2:25:49] so many beautiful things we could draw
[2:25:50] out here remember where was where was
[2:25:52] Ruth's time of safety
[2:25:55] where was Ruth's position in the harvest
[2:25:58] season it was at boaz's feet
[2:26:02] and she goes and Bows herself and
[2:26:04] humbles itself it comes down to wash the
[2:26:07] servant's feet
[2:26:09] and it says in verse 42 and Abigail
[2:26:11] hasted and arose and rode upon an ass
[2:26:14] with five damsels of hers that went
[2:26:17] after her and she went after the
[2:26:19] messengers of David and he and became
[2:26:22] his wife
[2:26:25] musicians can come
[2:26:28] praise the Lord
[2:26:40] see we have a modern-day Abigail also
[2:26:44] remember the woman that had the drunk
[2:26:46] husband
[2:26:48] God got a hold of him
[2:26:50] because God was fighting her battles
[2:26:53] what about the woman of Samaria
[2:26:55] you see now now we can come and we can
[2:26:57] take all these stories and we can go
[2:26:58] from Romans 7. and we can go to Romans
[2:27:01] 8.
[2:27:02] and it starts a whole new chapter in The
[2:27:04] Eighth Day amen and what does it say
[2:27:07] there is therefore now now
[2:27:10] no condemnation
[2:27:12] [Applause]
[2:27:13] we're free from the law
[2:27:16] the Abigail was free from the law of her
[2:27:19] old husband
[2:27:20] praise the Lord
[2:27:22] free from condemnation free from guilt
[2:27:25] free from that oppression
[2:27:28] free from his influences
[2:27:30] [Music]
[2:27:35] we'll go back to Romans 7 and just close
[2:27:37] with with us
[2:27:39] Romans 7 and verse 4. and I trust that
[2:27:42] the story has just brought some insight
[2:27:44] to this because sometimes we read these
[2:27:46] things and we hear about laws and
[2:27:47] husbands and all these things and it's
[2:27:49] hard to really relate what God has
[2:27:51] really done for us
[2:27:52] in our day right now I'm not talking
[2:27:56] about just 2 000 years ago my brother
[2:27:59] and sister I'm talking about right now
[2:28:01] what God is doing for us
[2:28:04] Romans 7 and 4 says wherefore my
[2:28:06] brethren ye also are become dead to the
[2:28:09] law by the body of Christ
[2:28:12] what is the body of Christ the word
[2:28:17] that you should be married to another he
[2:28:20] made a way of Escape
[2:28:21] even to him who is raised from the dead
[2:28:24] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[2:28:27] God for when we were in the flesh the
[2:28:30] Motions of sins which were by the lauded
[2:28:33] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[2:28:35] unto death this is where Abigail was
[2:28:38] she was under that law and because of
[2:28:41] that law of the flesh the Motions of
[2:28:43] sins which were by the law see it
[2:28:46] couldn't do anything else that's all it
[2:28:48] knew how to do
[2:28:50] is bring oppression it couldn't bring
[2:28:52] her to Christ
[2:28:55] could only show her her weaknesses and
[2:28:58] that's what the law did only showed our
[2:29:00] weak spots
[2:29:02] our insufficiency
[2:29:04] [Music]
[2:29:05] verse 6 says but now
[2:29:08] but now we are delivered from the law
[2:29:12] in other words we're free
[2:29:14] [Music]
[2:29:15] that being dead wherein we were held
[2:29:18] that we should serve in the newness of
[2:29:20] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[2:29:22] letter
[2:29:25] what can we say to these things
[2:29:28] we're free
[2:29:29] amen let's Stand Together
[2:29:34] amen praise the Lord
[2:29:42] let's sing the song that they're playing
