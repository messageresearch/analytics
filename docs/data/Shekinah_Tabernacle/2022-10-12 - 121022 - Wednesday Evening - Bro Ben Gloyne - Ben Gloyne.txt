I was going to read the four verses here and then you can um you can have your seats all trading you have your seats so First Corinthians 15 1 to 4. amen who's excited for Camp hallelujah we're gonna have a jubilee time if we have a Rapture why not you know good place to have it hey good place to have it start marching around the church and dance and we'll find ourselves in that other realm before we know it it could happen tonight you never know praise the Lord as long as you're ready lamps trimmed and clear full of the Holy Ghost amen so First Corinthians 11 15. amen more over Brethren I declare unto you uh I declare unto you uh the gospel which I preached unto you also uh which also ye have received and wherein you stand by which also you are saved if you keep in memory that which I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain and that um keep you in the memory means how fast the word which I announced unto you as the Glad Tiding suit right anyway so for I've delivered unto you first of all that which I've also received how Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures amen it seems you know it's interesting how the Apostle Paul uh repeats this phrase according to the scriptures and that's what I want to go into tonight according to the scriptures amens let's just bow heads in the word of prayer tonight you could have need to raise it before Lord with an uplifted hand gracious Lord we are so thankful we live in the season where that mountain has to move the giant has to fall Lord you have promised us total victory in this day Lord we believe it Lord we take you your word and well we want to press the battle like never before we thank you dear God we can gather

thank you Lord you hear our prayers your mindful of every situation we're in and we just want to commit the service into your hands For Your Glory Lord and Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless your friends you may have your seats tonight so yes that was my it was just uh yesterday that phrase kept coming into you know upon my heart according to the scriptures and I had to look it up and I found it in the scripture here that you know the it's it's very interesting you know if you do something according to something it's based upon that and that's where your Authority comes from so the Lord our lord Jesus dying and then raising again wasn't according to man's idea a man's opinion on what he felt like doing but it was according to the prophecy concerning his life and we know that everyone is living under a prophecy you know the world is living under prophecy and it's going to be fulfilled according to the scriptures uh our lord Jesus life was uh prophecy then it became manifested and it was all according to the scripture you know we um you know uh people have done studies and they've shown that our lord Jesus fulfilled over 300 prophecies in the days of his flesh all of his life was according to the scriptures he was born in Bethlehem according to the scriptures you know he would he'd be raised up in Nazareth so it'd be called a Nazarene according to the scriptures he'd have to go down to Egypt because it was would say in the scriptures out of you I've called my sons he'd have to go there then come back according to the scriptures you know he would he would raise the dead heal the sick let you heal the lepers all those things according to the scriptures he'd be the Lamb of God which would take away the sin of the world according to the scripture and we know that as his life was scripture fulfilled so our life is scripture fulfilled you know as brother bran would say as our lord Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament so the bride will fulfill the new so our lives uh should be according to the scriptures because we know that the anointing they were under that's the only thing that we can live by you look through church history you take the martyrs they were under the ox anointing they had to give themselves as beasts of sacrifice because that's the only way they could live is because they're under that kind of anointing they're glad they gave their lives under that great persecution they were under then then came the man anointing of you know you know of the Holy Ghost where Martin Luther and very smart educated men who knew multiple languages in the Greek and the Hebrew different things could translate the Bible because that was the anointing they were under combat the enemy and then now we've come down to this end time where we are under the eagle anointing and so if you're under that anointing you'll be above Church politics you'll be above family trouble you'll be able to look beyond the trouble that's going on in your life you'll be able to look Beyond National trouble international travel Regional trouble personal trouble you'll be able to look Beyond it and see from eternity to Eternity right so what that means is you can look at things according to the word and not look at how you see it I mean you won't look at it based on what you see in front of you but you'll take it back to the scripture it'll be according to the scriptures you know it's so amazing that every Parable every scripture pertains to today so every type and Shadow in the Old Testament is fulfilled in this day now we could take for example you know Jesus would tell many parables he'd tell about you know the prodigal son for example how you know their product you know their youngest son took his inheritance wasted it lived in a far country you know was in a pig pen so on but there was a believing father that prayed for his child and was determined that he would not be satisfied till that child returned now that's more than just a nice story but it was actually speaking of a people in the end time where that would happen to someone but they would have the faith that their child's coming home right away with family whoever it may be amen is just like the same thing with the parable of the woman with the Lost coin you know we know in uh in Israel you know they had 10 10 coins in their in their headdress and that represented them being married it was like a reading wedding ring I'm just going to go into the slow laner but I feel like I'm going too fast you know it showed their marriage it was like a wedding band on our hand it was the same with the coins now she lost one of those coins she lost part of her identity and so her husband was coming back instead of her just facing you know she she was determined because she knew she lost it somewhere so she began to sweep the house to find that lost coin and she only rested when she found that lost part of her identity that's the same thing with you and I we're United to the word but the devil can come in and steal our joy steal our peace steal our love whatever it may be but there'll be a people in the end time will be determined I'm not living without that lost part of myself just like she was so we could see all these Parables pertain to us in this day amen you know the two on the way to Emmaus were living in fulfilled prophecy they had just seen many prophecies fulfilled in the last hours of Jesus life and they were broken-hearted you know their Messiah you know their Prophet you know you know they believed he was a mighty Prophet had been crucified the ministry had locked themselves away in the upper room Judas the church treasure he came committed suicide their whole church movement had fallen apart and they are walking back to Emmaus the village with our from and and then but a stranger joined them and it says in Luke 24 it was actually Jesus but the Bible says that they could not see him because they could not identify him because their eyes wrecked it was hidden to them but here he was the resurrected Christ was walking with two of his disciples and they would he would begin to ask them you know what's going on what's Happening and they were surprised what do you mean what things that are happening are you have you just crawled out from under a rock or you know how do you not know what's going on the whole city's been in an uproar and many things have happened great discussions you know and then they would try and film they would they would fill this Stranger in into what was going on but they didn't realize that the one who fulfilled all those prophecies was walking with them and then so they were I mean so he would say to them oh fools and slow pardon is and then he had started Moses and then start from Moses go all the way through the scriptures everything that he fulfilled brother Brown um condenses here in modern events May clear by prophecy he says let's just go back a few minutes and now let's listen to the words quoted from himself watch here the word itself quoting the word of himself the word itself quoting the word of himself not to tell them that he was that but just let the word speak for itself then they know who he was the letter of the word quoting the word the word and flesh quoting the word of the letter being fully identified with him look here now let's listen to him quote now now we know that they were all briefed of the late happenings that is of the crucifixion of the story of the Resurrection the tomb as we just read now he goes straight to the word of the prophecy about himself now let's just think what he's uh that he said this he said a lot more than this but watch because remember he he spoke them for six hours as they're walking to a mass now uh let's say him hear him say turn over to Zechariah 11 and 12 and wasn't the Messiah to be sold according to the prophet for 30 pieces of silver you just said that this man was sold for 30 piece of silver turnover you're getting them scriptures Zechariah 11 and 12. then he said did you notice that David said in the psalm Psalms 14 1 and 9 he is to be betrayed by his friends and then again in Zechariah 13 and 7 he was forsaken by his disciples and in Psalms 35 11 Accused by false witnesses as you just said he was Isaiah 53 and 7. he was done before his accusers Isaiah 50 and 6 they scorched him the prophet said in Psalms 22 he was to cry on the cross my God my God why is our forsaken me did he do that day before yesterday afternoon Psalms 22 again 18 His Garment was parted among them did they do that and Psalms 22 7-8 mocked by his enemies the church psalms 22 again there was not to be a bone of his body broke and they but they pierced my hands and my feet he said holding his hands behind him no doubt at the time Isaiah 53 and 12 and he said he would die between male factors Isaiah 53 and 9 said he's used to be buried with the rich psalm 16 and 10 said I'll not leave us soul and Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption and was not Malachi 3 the Forerunner of this man oh I'd like to have heard him quote that look at the prophecies notice then all the types he might have gone through about Isaac in Genesis 22 and God foreshadowed isakower his father Abraham took his own son packing the wood up the hill and offered up his own son it was now beginning to soak into them he had done told them that they were fools for not looking at the prophecy for that day and now it began to soak in begin to see the fulfilling of all this that had taken place in the last days the last two or three years The Vindicator Prophecy of the age it was then that they knew that their crucified friend Jesus had fulfilled every word of this oh it was then that they know that that man truly was that Messiah that he should raise from the dead I love that when he's asking me questions did he do that did they do that and we can bring It Forward into this day didn't the scriptures say that Malachi 4 would be the Forerunner of this you know you know of the word of the second coming of Christ amen was not brother Bram given to signs one would be in the hand and the other bit of discernment of the heart did that happen right then he say an angel meet him in a cave and you know it's one thing to say an angel met you it's nothing for that angel to come down night after night meeting after meeting in front of thousands and thousands of people and prove himself did that happen yes amen did exactly you know to the cloud a pair of a sunset Mountain the Seven Seals come open did that happen right now has a bride risen up in power and Faith how's that happen right has the word put on flesh again has that happened right so we can see now that that the day we live in is according to the scripture we can see in Revelation 3 that we would be rich and increase with Goods is that not the age we live in well but also say to be blind naked miserable wretched and don't know it right so we can see that if if all this prophecy is being fulfilled that's right then the end result of that prophecy is going to be fulfilled as well no we've got to understand that when you know when Jesus Jesus would stand in the synagogue now it's one thing to talk about prophecy it's nothing to declare it's been fulfilled to talk about prophecy there's no controversy in talking about it no doubt the rabbis and the scribes and the Pharisees they would talk about prophecy all the day long but then a Man From Galilee stood up in the synagogue one day and he turned to Isaiah and he found you know Isaiah 61 and he began to read that portion of scripture says that the spirit of the Lord is upon me prayer sent me to to Open the Eyes of the blind said at Liberty those that kept of your heal those that are bruised to preach the except for the year of the Lord and then he would read that and then he'd say this day is this scripture fulfilled now you would expect all that congregation to stand up give glory to God and praise His holy name that he God had visited them in their hour and had fulfilled the prophecy no doubt they would have read that prophecy and said isn't that gonna be amazing when it's fulfilled and they would have got excited about that but when a man stood there and said this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears they got angry hey when you're even neutral about it they got angry they're gonna throw them down a hill throw them down a bluff they they took them out of town they're going to throw them down a bluff but he but he walked his way out from among them so you see the controversy is never talking about the prophecy the controversy is always in the Fulfillment of the prophecy why was Jesus so controversial in his day because he said I am the Messiah I am the Fulfillment of everything you've been looking for here I am and yet all his life was according to the scriptures you know we watched um Sight and Sound did a did a play on the life of Jesus that's good I think it's good but there's um there's a um Nicodemus and there's Joseph of arathea they're you know their Pharisees in the play Nicodemus especially but then they begin to Nicodemus when when Jesus would do something hit he'd pull out a scroll out of his bow to be a prophecy he'd read it and say he just did that you know he'd do this and you know come in on the donkey there you're into Jerusalem though crying Hosanna and then hits had a um he'd say to uh Joseph that's what Zechariah said would happen behold your king comes unto your Zone on a you know on a donkey you know and then and then when Jesus hang on the cross crying out my God my God why is have forsaken me Nicodemus would pick up the scroll and say look this is in the Psalms you know so they were actually seeing the word being fulfilled they could look beyond what they see with their eyes God would give a special Grace to a people that they could see what they see in front of them is the Fulfillment of scripture now it takes the Sovereign Grace of God to open people's eyes you know it's not it's not an intellect that can open the eyes of the blind the spiritual eyes to give an understanding it's God that will do that it's only God that can do that now it's so vitally important that we can see fulfilled scripture in this day and we need to look at our own lives as scripture being fulfilled amen so you know we can look at Jesus life and say yes it was all according to the scriptures and then we can even look at brother Brown's Ministry and say yes it was according to the scripture where where the Lord Jesus promised that in this day as it was in the days of Noah as it was days of lot so you'll see the revealing of the son of man and we have seen a Ministry in the South I know this is nothing new to you but you know we've seen a Ministry in the South the same Ministry that Jesus had has come down into redeemed son and he's revealed himself in the same way like he revealed the secrets and hearts of you know the woman at the well Nathaniel under the tree all those different ones you know the scripture says in many you know many places in the gospel says and he knew their thoughts and that happened in front of thousands of thousands of people down to their address and what they're wearing at the time with us sitting when they're praying different amazing credible details that was all done out in the open so we've seen this happen that's right amen amen but then also the son of man would be revealed not just in one man but in a multi-membered body right so that same son of man that same Lord Jesus Christ comes into a multi-membered body Rachel was just in one man and a prophet but now that same Holy Ghost and the people around the world right doing living the same word out brother man was saying for someone who's fully surrendered to God then the thoughts and thoughts and tenses of the heart will be discerned through that person the word will put on flesh in that same way anyway amen but all these things are according to the scripture now we look at our own lives we're where the scripture would say the marriage of the Lamb has come this is Revelations 19 and his wife has made herself ready and it was granted unto her that should be a raid and final and clean and white which is the righteousness of the Saints now once upon a time that was a prophecy but now it is a reality right now it is happening amen if you have truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've been a raid in the wedding garment that is your winning government that you know the word is put on flesh in you you yeah because it's great it says enter her was granted so basically the Lord says here's my wardrobe here's the wedding garment put it on he said oh it fits me just right Hallelujah come to find out the word Fitzy just right but to see all this is done according to the scriptures just like we get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the scriptures because you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost according to the scriptures and that means that when you when you receive the Holy Ghost you can see your life in the Bible right you can look through any type of shadow of a Believer and you can identify with that same one because that same spirit that was in them is in you amen and you can see a book of Acts written behind your life praise the Lord amen now we had a promise when we first started this church that we you know we had a prayer meeting up at brother Andy's place and we had a Tang's interpretation says if you remain humble my word will continue to go forth and I will bring my people here and they shall find my rest now the rest is the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that was a promise we had in the very beginning now I do not believe God has never stood up and said I finished with that promise no that promise is still here you say well I need that in the scripture well I'll give it to you in the scripture God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble right sometimes he'll give grace to you for someone else right that's why if we remain humble he giveth grace to the humble right that when people come here they'll get that same Grace the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I don't see anywhere where that promise will stop until the change of the body right so now we've got to be we're going to be under expectation where people come and they just kind of wander in and wander around and they haven't really met the Lord yet we'll say no no the promise here is that they should meet God right the people shouldn't just be halfway in and just gather around because a nice group of people the food's good whatever they're you know tick box says it's happy you know no but they should they should meet the Lord amen so we should be really deadly sincere Lord we want to be humble now your word will go forth that God will speak that God will listen that God walked into someone's address and speak to them about what they've been speaking to people about or what they've been thinking about and that will cause people to surrender their lives over and they will meet the same Jesus that we know amen but we've got to realize that if we if we want to take more ground the enemy is going to try and push us back yeah yeah you know I was talking to Ben about this the other day you know what struck me about the Gallipoli um exhibit there in um te Papa well many things did but one thing is is they show a three-dimensional map of of where where they fought and they showed the timeline of how far the anzacs would advance and you know of course every time I Advance the Turks would try and push them back there's always a counter-attack would come and that's how it happens in war You Know The Enemy advances you know we may advance or the enemy May Advance the other side is not just going to let them Advance they're going to try and push them off the ground they have just gained as the same thing with you and I we're beginning to grow on the Lord we're going to take our positions you know we yeah we look at Promises of you know of your healing of restoration of faith of joy of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit whatever it may be the devil doesn't want us to possess those promises you know we have a good meeting you have a good time of prayer you enjoy the word what's that that's you gaining ground the devil doesn't want you to hold that ground he wants to push you back maybe with discouragement maybe maybe with pride or jail policy or insecurity something will come and try and push you off that ground you've just gained I say it's time we don't get pushed back no more I say let's take every bit of Grant and let's keep advancing and if the enemy is counter-attacking we should expect them to do it amen because we're in a battle right but so we should be ready for the counter attack hey man that's why it's so important to hold that Shield of Faith which quenches the fiery darts of the enemy remember the devil doesn't physically stand there and fire fire it out to you no but he'll anoint someone or something to happen to to say something and that can be a fiery Dart now if that if you don't hold up that Shield of Faith how do you hold the shield of Faith up well you give the benefit of the doubt or you don't take it to heart you say father forgive them they don't know what they do or they didn't really mean that if they're really in a good space they wouldn't really mean that you're they're my brother or sister their family whatever it was that's holding up the shield of Faith right but if you load that Shield of faith and take it kindly well that's going to push you back but we've come to a place I I think we've come to a place where let's not be pushed back no more let's advance according to the scripture you know as brother Isaac stood here and preached you from Jordan to the Sea we're going to take the whole promise of God we're going to take every promises in the book there's gonna be ours amen it's going to be ours doesn't matter how much the opposition how much call for Melody may come in or some argument you know a real testimony is never is never underneath an argument an argument never beats a testimony amen amen right yeah describes and Pharisees couldn't stand it that a man that was born blind was healed by the Lord you know here's a guy born blind and you know the disciples asked the question it wasn't him or his parents sin do you know why is this judgment come upon him how how interesting it is people want to think well it must be judgment you know just like job's friends we don't want to be job's friend we want to be his real friends and actually share with a real God right we don't want to be job's friends like they were in the Bible we understand but so but he said neither but the glory of God would be done and so here's this man Jesus heals him he comes back in he's rejoicing his parents are there and you know and then and then I don't know if it was I don't know what Pharisees said and he said you know we know this Jesus you know he said give glory to God we know this Jesus is a sinner you know and the and the guy who used to be blind said well one thing I don't know if he's a sinner or not but one thing I know I was blind but now I see this has never been done in all of history a person born blind has been restored their sight so an argument can come along this is wrong this message is false blah blah blah but if you've really met the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ that stuff don't mean nothing because all he can be just like the blind man all I know is I came in contact with this word to transformed my life and I don't want to go back and be blind no more stay sing thank you very much Hallelujah so amen so now according to the scriptures this is who we are going to be a woman of Faith you look at the New Testament I mean the Bride is a woman of faith amen amen she's a woman of Faith as Sarah had a visitation you know it's amazing how you think about Luke 17 30 in the days of lot so shall be when the son of man is revealed in the days of Lord is when when Abraham and Moses had their visitation by God himself and so it's incredible when you think about it where we can actually entertain angels unawares as as the Bible says now sometimes they can be in a physical form they can look like an ordinary person but sometimes the word can come and anointing of God can come and we can entertain God next to be unaware of who we're enjoying actually many times we will entertain demons unawares because thoughts come negative thoughts negative feelings you know distance between people malice or strife and you you just be stewing on something that doesn't mean anything what are you doing you're entertaining a devil hold on who am I talking to amen where am I having a conversation who's on the other end of the phone you know and you come to yourself and realize no that's not of God that's not of God you know a couple of the days ago I just thought Pat in my mind you know God doesn't hear my prayers he's distant somewhere he doesn't hear you your prayers are in vain you know I think it actually make it into meditate on that didn't make me feel happy one bit but then I began to think no the scripture says that his blood is broken down every middle wall of partition he has brought me now he said I'll never leave enough forsake thee his blood puts me off speaking terms with him and that thought just vanished right but I was entertaining the wrong thing yes amen but that's why we should we said Lord I want to be entertaining you even unawares but eventually I'll come to recognition just like Sarah she didn't realize that one of the well there's two angels it was God and flesh sitting in the tent outside of her you know she has an attempt inside they were outside she was entertaining God himself and she didn't really realize it but there came a time when she realized it yes amen so we want to have an atmosphere around us they were Entertaining Angels and it's not unawares where sweet humble feeling Cuts sweeps over you Faith begins to rise what's that angel steps into your house Hallelujah we want to entertain that stay you can't leave I don't know how to lock the door and keep you in but but don't go don't you want to have that kind of atmosphere then the Lord steps into the house Holly you have a prayer meeting just talk about and be washing dishes vacuuming whatever you may be doing just that anointing the atmosphere just changes Hallelujah I believe we can have those kind of times I'm amen so you know we've got to be very aware like because because the New Testament has actually more visitations of angels than the old and we still live in the New Testament era amen amen so we're going to look at our lives as it is according to the scriptures now as Jesus said to his disciples as the father sent me so send are you so it wasn't a church that sent them it wasn't the Sanhedrin or a group of people it wasn't even themselves that sent them but God sent them amen right and it's the same thing with you and I as as the prophet was sent by God so God sends you and I so that means all of Heaven is behind you right you are not the embassy of yourself like a like a diplomatic call right we have embassies in Wellington here there's the Russian Embassy there's the Australian embassies there's the American Embassy Chinese all of them in there that have diplomatic relations with this country right so all of that country stands behind that Diplomat or that Ambassador all they ask all the glory or whatever all the Armed Forces whatever is in that country I mean is actually being represented by that person who is the ambassador so now we are not backed by a natural country right we are back by Heaven All That Heaven is is behind you and I we become ambassadors of Heaven amen just as all of you know Jesus said you know don't you think that I could call my father hits in 12 Legions of angels I think it was he said that's you know if you break down the numbers that's thousands and thousands of angels He just Winkle give the nun or whatever that all be there and they would have turned the whole place upside down even one would turn the whole place upside down why because he was he was God made flesh but all heaven was was behind him now if we are the bride of Christ which we are I believe according to the scriptures amen then all of Heaven is behind us so if all of Heaven is behind us why should we settle for second best against the devil why should we put up with his lies as slander his doubts you know his worries his fears we shouldn't put up with none of it amen we should just take God at his word because we've got to realize that God does the impossible I don't know if you've really come to that conclusion But as God does what we think is impossible I mean Jonah was in the belly of a whale you think it was a prepared phrase the Bible said you think it's physically possible for them to get out of that well I don't know how deep that well went down into the dips but even if it even if it opened its mouth up there and vomited Jonah out in the bottom of the sea he would have died right he couldn't physically get out there was no Escape at your emergency door open to get out of that fish right but the Lord anointed that well because Jonah and Faith said oh look once more to your Holy Temple right and he went up to the service and sped him out upon the bank so that seemed to be an impossible situation amen Elijah would stand on Mount Carmel now humanly it was impossible to bring fire yeah but he did he said when he prepared the altar he prepared the wood the sacrifice had the water poured upon it when he prayed he said Lord I have done all this according to Thy word so he did it all according to the scripture right it was a vision he walked according to the vision and it happened but God did a supernatural Victory because why he did it all according to the scripture and if you stand for God's word God will stand for you amen God will stand for you so you've got to realize that God is behind us we can be the weakest part of the church it doesn't matter God said he will bear us like a father does as young right so he's not going to leave us behind if we feel we can't keep up God will slow the whole program down to get us there Hallelujah because he's determined that we're gonna get there so you look at the impossible situations of Israel by the Red Sea they couldn't cross the Red Sea but God opened the Red Sea for them to walk over on dry land yeah now God does the impossible Lazarus was four days in the grave his body was already rotting they didn't bomb people like we do these days is it a hot country his nose begin the cavinary brain was already decaying but yet the resurrection of Life came to his tomb that's why we can physically look because remember they said to him Lord buddy stinketh he's already gone beyond he's gone beyond hope maybe maybe they even begin to think well he just died but the law can raise him again because we've seen him go past the funeral procession and then the boy came to life or driest daughter that freshly died but then she came to life again so maybe they had a little bit of Hope Mary would Santa Martha don't weep it's gonna be okay Jesus will get here before he begins to rot but then the first day went then the second day went than the third day yeah yeah and that was day number four and maybe their hearts your sunk think it's too late but when God when there's a difference between us saying too late and God saying too late right and we want to stick on that When God says right even with the Lazarus was four days in the grave rotting already God said I'm on time I'm right on time you may think it's good because they've said Lord if you'd only been here us our our brother would not have died but don't you know I'm the resurrection of the life leave us thou this and they said yay Lord we believe Hallelujah so God does the impossible Peter was in the inner prison he was in the inner prison he wasn't just in the outer prison he was in maximum maximum security he had he had God's chain to either side of him he was in a prison now he was a Spirit-filled Holy Ghost filled man right but he was in a prison and there he was stuck but God allowed it in such a way that an angel came to him he thought it was a dream smote him on the side the chains fell off told him to get dressed put on his shoes Hallelujah and God took him out of the prison on it I mean so there's nothing you say well this this person is Chained in a prison of complex as an unbelief and pain and hurt and there's no prison too big no mental condition too big there is no impossible situation with God that's true Hallelujah according to the scripture Legion had a thousand demons in him you think he's gone too far no but Jesus said we're gonna cross because he knew Legion was there he went to find Legion amen so according to the scriptures there's no case too difficult for God police we need to start them and and I'm not saying that you don't believe a lot of this but we need to believe for the impossible like never before because this is the age where impossibilities become fulfilled amen where it's no longer impossible but it is possible and it is done Hallelujah brother Brown would would be brought a woman that many men had to because she was in a straight jacket mental institution had to be brought into the meeting into a room and she was slithering on the ground like a snake as man's voice was speaking out of her very strong broke out the windows in the car all these different things you'd think it's impossible for her to ever to come back to her right mind and their voice it'd have nothing to do to do with me William Branham I've got nothing to do with you and he just prayed for her and they and nothing seemed to happen then then they said what you doing there take her back three days later she was found saying normal she got released [Music] so that's the same God as today amen we've seen demons cast out we've seen the Holy Ghost fill people amen we've seen healings take place we've seen people go from Lost to found amen we've seen God do the impossible in our midst so so I believe we should rally like never before that if we remain humble that his word will continue to go forth this is what I'm praying for camp and he will bring there's been people coming to campus never come before don't know their background don't know where they're from but they're coming amen and I believe they're coming because they'll find rest they'll meet God at Camp that's what I'm believing for amen because that promise is still being fulfilled Hallelujah why amen because I believe it's according it's according to the scriptures amen when we take the rapture we can say well that was all according to the scriptures amen Hallelujah every promise is for today every promise in the word is for today it's not for yesterday or tomorrow it's for right now he is the god of the impossible you say well I've been praying for saying for years just hold on if it's according to the scripture hold on for the promise amen then one day Faith will drop in it'll be a revelation then it's going to happen amen we should never ever look at a promise of God and say no we cannot have that because Jesus when he died on Calvary he died to purchase every promise for your name every Divine promise becomes our divine right you know in this hour this people are standing up for their rights it doesn't matter how absurd they may be to the same mind they're standing up for their rights how much more now the Bride of Jesus Christ we should stand up for our god-given rights amen we have the right for God to move in our services we have a right for the gifts of the Spirit we have right for Joy we're right for peace we have a right for divine love to be manifested amen we have a right for the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have a right for healing and for deliverance everywhere to pray what we think is impossible and God does the impossible amen we have a right but not because we are anything in ourselves remember this is not a reward program you know like you buy 10 coffees oh you buy nine coffees get the ten free it doesn't work like that with God right this is not a Rewards program as Jesus Paid It all he gave it to you and I we accept it and believe it and then be under expectation it's going to happen right this is not a reward it's not like Lord I listen to all these messages now and I've prayed this long so therefore I've earned her I've earned her healing somewhere it doesn't work that way Jesus paid for it all it's not our worthiness that matters right he was the perfect lamb according to the scriptures right he was the Lamb of God that took away the sin of the world according to the scriptures according to the scriptures in the Old Testament the lamb was examined the worshiper was not examined right just like even now the Jews are looking for a red hair for sacrifice to make the Waters of Separation to purify the priesthood that they can build the temple and do all those things see but but they are and they're under expectation it's going to be born they even think they have them yeah they're not quite old enough to be sacrificed yet but they think they have them in there and they're praying that not one hair will turn a different color than red now we already have our red hair for sacrifice the The Living Word Christ is the Waters of Separation but it's nothing that we could humanly generate that could separate us from sin separate us from unbelief no God gave us the Waters of separation right according to the scriptures he has supplied his own sacrifice Lord amen amen so all the pressure really our faith must be in him not in ourselves right of your confidence isn't yourself you're going to be disappointed real bad but if your confidence and faith is in the Lord you can never be disappointed because though we take you through a trial he'll lead you through the trial you know when you lead somebody say come we're going here and they follow you and you walk through it now we're going over here okay okay follow me over here hallelujah he doesn't send us anywhere and just say go there he he leads us there he leads us into it and through it I mean amen so we've got to have I I trust we have the most confidence we've ever had in our lives is right now it in amen that our lord Jesus according to the scriptures has made us ready amen that according to the scriptures we are new creatures in Christ Jesus right that we can look at our lives and say what we read about in the scripture we are the Fulfillment of it amen we're here to take us Transformers will go from glory to glory so what we once uh the enemy that we once were defeated by we conquered it and then we come a year forward and we're about higher than we were a year ago our character has become more like the Lord than it was a year ago what going from glory to glory to glory but who's doing it it's the Lord that's what I mean I mean why because he's fulfilling his word according to the scriptures that he'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle washing the blood of lamb mate isn't a mate In His Image amen and I believe I'm looking at a room of people that are the Fulfillment amen of that amen of that prophecy amen where if the Bible would be written after the Rapture you'd say they put your name in there and according to the scriptures they overcome lady I see you they weren't lukewarm but they were on fire for God they loved him more than anything and they overcame the dragon the Beast by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony that's why at some point to testify of what God has promised yeah and say I believe God can do it God's on his way he's going to fulfill his words how's he going to do it I don't know but he's going to do it amen Shadrach men shaking Abednego just said well if we burn we burn but if not he'll Deliver us but we're not gonna bow amen so we can stand like them and say we are not going to bow to this world but according to the scriptures we're going to walk with God Hallelujah remember he wants you to walk with him more than you want to walk with him he wants you that's why he called you in the hour he called you because he wanted fellowship with you you know we think it's just all us looking for God now God was looking for us we want that Lord I want a closer walk with you the reason you feel that way is because he wants a closer walk with you he's the one who initiates it he's the one who says Lord sure there comes a time where you draw Knight to have healed your night to you but why do we draw night to him is because he puts it in our heart to draw it like him so I just responded to the call you say well I don't feel like it well that's why that's why it's so important when you don't feel nothing to stand there for yeah praise Lord and the whole armor of God just stand he say I don't feel like it I'm not going back you know I don't feel a draw but I'm not going back there's nothing for me to go back to see the devil said see see the devil's got emotions so wrapped up in this age and so he will actually go before God and say well I bet you if they feel nothing they're gonna go back you know and God says sure fine I'll prove you wrong amen amen and then we're here feeling As Dead As opposed sometimes and the Devil beats us on the head saying you're just going through the motion and you're just you're listening this is just you know you don't feel anything so nothing's real but there's something in her heart just is but I'm not going back I still believe right and then you go through a period of that sometime and then God just yeah Satan goes up before God and God says I told you so because he's got confidence in you I told you so devil and then it goes from that feeling dry to now a big gusher of water just comes down to the Holy Spirit Hallelujah because the devil has to be God wants to prove to the devil that we are not walking by emotion only we're walking by faith and sometimes we have no feelings but sometimes we do but we've got to have confidence you know if you don't feel anything don't say this is just how you're going to be for the rest of your life never set off that you're going to come through that right you've got to come back up the mountain again amen we should be full of joy on speaker full of Glory Hallelujah I trust we can look at our lives and we could go into this a lot deeper but I'm just going to finish it here but we could look at our lives and say it's all according to the scriptures right how we talk to each other is according to the scriptures how we dress is according to the scriptures how we talk to people on the street as a you know how we treat one another treat people treat our family all those things should we all be according to the scriptures not according to how we feel but according to the scriptures right you're having a bad day praise the Lord anyway amen don't don't let it Define you we've all got bad days but just praise the Lord anyway amen so I believe I'm looking at a people they are according to the scriptures just like our lord Jesus his whole life was according to the scriptures amen let's have the musicians tonight amen and then we'll just um sing a couple of songs and amen isn't amazing when you look into the word and you can see your character in there you can see that what you were you're not you're not the person you once were it's all the malice Strife injury hate emulations all those things are gone and it was God that did it and now you see peace love joy long sufferness gentleness meekness Faith you see those things growing in your life isn't it amazing when you see that amen where the Lord turns your heart such a way that actually you believe the whole word hallelujah what I bet you see your life is actually according to the scriptures it's not you trying to see this is not a mental you know ability that you line up to the word by it's a surrender and then he lines you up by a new birth Hallelujah price a lot I mean let's um let's stand shall we Hallelujah hey man I want to sing How Great Is Our God he's great oh and no no no let's sing let's sing uh magnify the Lord with me so honestly praise His name forever Hallelujah I heard brother Ron Spencer say you know the only people that cannot praise God is the Dead because they're dead but if you've got breath let everything has breath David said praise ye the Lord amen and he said I'll praise the Lord at all times so all times there's all times good day bad day terrible day best day worst day praise the Lord at all times things are falling apart things are all together things are sideways up ways downwards you don't know which way praise the Lord at all times so so I so I think that's what we should do amen because our God is always good yo Jesus you know Jesus has never done anything wrong to me I trust you have the same experience he's done only good so we surprised him at all times I mean and you're glad he answers you I love these words though and he answered me face a lot amen I saw the Lord and he answered me and delivered me thank you Lord from everybody [Music]
