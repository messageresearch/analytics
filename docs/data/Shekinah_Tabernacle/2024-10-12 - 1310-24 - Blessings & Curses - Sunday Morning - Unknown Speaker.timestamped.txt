[38:30] been dwelling on my heart for a little
[38:32] while is this concept of blessing and
[38:35] cursing and it's a concept I suppose
[38:38] that affects all of
[38:40] us
[38:42] um depending on how we choose to how how
[38:45] our life evolves and what essentially
[38:47] what we do but it it started off in my
[38:50] mind as quite a complicated subject
[38:52] because I hadn't really looked into it
[38:54] before and maybe even quite a scary
[38:56] subject you know but in in looking into
[39:01] it for a while I've kind of realized
[39:02] it's not really that scary you know it's
[39:05] not a it's not a very complicated thing
[39:06] it's actually I was surprised at the
[39:08] Simplicity of it all you know and and
[39:11] you know how that how that we can just
[39:13] live a blessed life and everything's
[39:14] going to be right you know we don't
[39:16] Satan can
[39:18] sometimes mess with affect our mind
[39:20] somehow to to to think there's some sort
[39:23] of cursing happening and all the we can
[39:24] just play around in areas that we maybe
[39:26] don't know but I just want to speak on
[39:27] this this morning so if you'll indulge
[39:29] I'd like to go through this and just
[39:31] take you through this these Concepts
[39:33] this morning and may the Lord help me
[39:35] it's
[39:36] it's it's it's quite a big subject but
[39:38] I've managed to I think compress it into
[39:40] a small amount of time okay because with
[39:43] this one you kind of have to get the
[39:45] entirety of it to for it to make sense
[39:47] even though it probably deserves a lot
[39:48] more time if you can sort of stand back
[39:50] and just get the entirety of this
[39:52] concept then it will make then it will I
[39:54] believe you'll be blessed
[39:58] this morning okay okay so you ready okay
[40:05] okay and as I always say you look you're
[40:07] very intelligent people I think if we
[40:09] did the IQ test we we we know we've got
[40:11] a high high IQ so I can go pretty fast
[40:18] okay okay I know I drag it down
[40:23] but okay blessings and cursing now Essen
[40:27] if we think of the word b the the
[40:28] concept of blessing it if you if you
[40:30] boil it down it means taking someone
[40:33] something to a better State than they
[40:35] are currently in because you know we say
[40:38] blessing is something we say with our
[40:39] mouth but then that thing we say has to
[40:41] eventually come into action it has to
[40:42] come into being right a blessing and a
[40:45] cursing essentially is taking someone to
[40:46] a worse State than they're currently in
[40:48] so it's this concept of something either
[40:50] gets better or it gets worse it's
[40:51] blessed or it's cursed that's this when
[40:54] we talk about this that's the result of
[40:56] that's the result of what we want to
[40:58] talk about now when we look at God the
[41:01] nature of God if we say by default like
[41:03] his natural thing that he would come out
[41:05] and do is to bless okay because he's a
[41:08] Creator by default he takes something
[41:10] that is not very much and makes it
[41:12] better that's his nature that he's he's
[41:13] a he he by Nature likes to bless he
[41:18] doesn't always bless but naturally
[41:19] that's what if you leave him to do what
[41:21] he does naturally he'll bless because
[41:23] that's what that's the nature of God
[41:24] right because he takes something to a
[41:25] better State and we can see that by the
[41:27] World there was this rock the the it
[41:29] says the Earth was without form and void
[41:31] but he didn't just leave it like that he
[41:33] decided I want to bless that I want to
[41:35] make it better than what it currently is
[41:37] okay so then then he the first thing he
[41:39] created was light he said let there be
[41:40] light there was light he begins to
[41:41] create this world the something makes
[41:45] something better so the first day it was
[41:46] better and then the second day he
[41:48] created the sky and the firmaments and
[41:50] it looked a bit better than more it was
[41:51] the day before cuz he's beginning to
[41:52] bless that's the way that God does it
[41:54] then the third day the dry land the Seas
[41:56] and the plant
[41:57] created and this this rock started to
[41:59] have life on it started to have Greenery
[42:01] it started to get better and better okay
[42:03] and then then on the fourth day created
[42:05] the Sun the moon and the stars the
[42:07] heavens and it just looked fantastic
[42:08] after that you can imagine there black
[42:10] space and suddenly there's all these
[42:11] lights in the sky and these planets
[42:13] swirling around like this big mobile all
[42:15] happening you know and God's God's
[42:17] blessing he's naturally doing what he
[42:19] does naturally as bless and then on the
[42:21] fifth day it says you created all the
[42:23] creatures that live in the sea and the
[42:24] creatures that were flying and then when
[42:26] he created those creatures God it says
[42:28] God bless them he said
[42:31] multiply cuz that's the way that God is
[42:33] he likes to bless and then on the sixth
[42:35] day it says he made all the the animals
[42:38] that the animals that walk around and
[42:40] that then he then he made this amazing
[42:42] creature called man and he and he he he
[42:45] made male and female then it says and
[42:47] God blessed them and God said to them be
[42:49] fruitful and multiply and and replenish
[42:51] the Earth and sub Jordan have dominion
[42:53] over the fish of the sea and over the
[42:54] foul of the earth and over every living
[42:55] thing that moveth upon the Earth so the
[42:58] first words that God spoke to man we he
[43:00] blessed them cuz he because that's the
[43:03] god that we serve as a God that wants to
[43:05] bless okay that's you got to understand
[43:07] his nature so that's very important for
[43:09] the what we're talking about and you
[43:10] could say that the whole of creation was
[43:12] blessed by God you know when when you
[43:14] look around you look at this thing that
[43:16] we've got and you and it's not no it's
[43:19] no longer just a rock it's no longer
[43:20] just this this thing that doesn't have
[43:21] any substance or value or beauty but now
[43:24] it's been blessed to it's this beautiful
[43:26] thing this creation and I think every
[43:29] man or woman if they just look at
[43:30] creation have to appreciate its beauty
[43:32] you know we can evolve a lot but we
[43:34] never get any bigger as people I thought
[43:35] that the other day we never really get
[43:36] bigger so every time we look at a
[43:38] mountain it's always big it doesn't
[43:40] matter how far technology comes along we
[43:41] don't become bigger people a Mountain's
[43:43] always big we lived 5,000 years ago and
[43:46] now a mountain is big and it's glorious
[43:48] you know we we we can we we take it and
[43:51] we think that's that's glorious There's
[43:52] Something About That Mountain or there's
[43:54] something about that ocean when we see
[43:55] the vastness of what God's made or the
[43:57] the heavens you know now I want to talk
[44:00] now about then we live there was a world
[44:02] that was blessed but there was the The
[44:03] First Curse that came upon the Earth and
[44:06] in order to start to talk about that we
[44:08] have to talk we have to understand the
[44:09] nature of Satan is then to curse he's
[44:12] not a Creator he doesn't have the
[44:13] ability to create something better he's
[44:16] his only what he's got is to curse he
[44:18] brings things down that's his whole
[44:20] nature is to tear down not build up
[44:23] that's why we Believers we want to build
[44:25] people up not tear them down cuz we know
[44:27] the nature of where those two come from
[44:28] right and and but you see in order to in
[44:32] order to get someone to a worse State
[44:33] than what they were before and someone
[44:35] willingly to go along with it they most
[44:37] of the time they've got to be tricked
[44:39] into it unless they're mentally insane
[44:40] like if if you had something and then I
[44:42] said look how about you end up with
[44:44] nothing most of you would say look now
[44:46] probably for first something you know
[44:48] but if I tricked you I said no you're
[44:49] going to get something far better than
[44:50] what you've got now and then the end
[44:51] result you got nothing you're like oh he
[44:53] tricked me now I got nothing you know
[44:55] you in order to come out to a worse
[44:57] State we Satan he uses trickery to get
[45:00] us to a worse state to to get us to a
[45:02] more cursed State than what we were at
[45:04] the start you know he tricks us he
[45:05] doesn't that's that's the way that he
[45:07] works and his first major act on Earth
[45:09] was to trick man to thinking you'll
[45:11] become better right that's but he but
[45:14] his whole intention was to curse them
[45:16] but he but he tried to offer them so
[45:19] that's why God said to them you God said
[45:21] to Adam and Eve you can eat of every
[45:22] tree but you can't be with each other
[45:25] sexually that's what you're not supposed
[45:26] to do okay just so we know that's what
[45:28] he said don't do that but Satan came
[45:30] along and he said because God said the
[45:33] day you do that that day you'll die and
[45:35] Satan come along and says no you won't
[45:36] die uh uh you'll be like Gods you'll be
[45:39] better you know he's starting to trick
[45:41] them you'll be intelligent so so they
[45:44] Eve went along with it because she
[45:45] thought I'm going to get something
[45:45] better out of this but she was he was
[45:47] tricking her to curse her to end up
[45:50] worse right she if he said look I'm
[45:52] going to go along with this then you're
[45:54] going to be cursed after that the whole
[45:55] world you know is going to change is
[45:57] going to be miserable are you king she
[45:58] would have said no way see that's that's
[46:00] the way Satan does it and essentially
[46:02] you ended up with this scenario where it
[46:04] says God says if you do that act you'll
[46:06] die that so if you stay inside the word
[46:09] you'll be blessed everything will go
[46:10] well for you right you'll be blessed it
[46:12] was honest but Satan says now you won't
[46:14] die you'll be like Gods you'll be
[46:15] intelligent but he he's taken them
[46:18] outside the word of God and they're
[46:19] going to be cursed and that's
[46:20] essentially the whole Crux of the whole
[46:22] sermon when you boil everything down
[46:24] this is how this whole thing works if we
[46:26] stand inside the word word of God we get
[46:27] blessed if we go outside the word of God
[46:29] we get cursed it's really that simple
[46:32] all the other stuff doesn't matter
[46:33] that's the way that it works regardless
[46:35] of how it might appear that is the way
[46:36] that this whole thing works every single
[46:39] time NE never changes okay so Adam and
[46:42] Eve Eve went and did that she did the
[46:46] act with the serpent which was actually
[46:48] a a a a human being walking around okay
[46:52] so then when you understand that okay so
[46:57] when she did when they she did the ACT
[46:59] then she did it with with Adam now now
[47:02] God had to then Implement there were
[47:05] curses that came upon the Earth after
[47:06] that right now the first curse he cursed
[47:08] the serpent so the serpent was walking
[47:10] around he said right because you did
[47:12] this you let Satan come in and do this
[47:14] you're going to be cursed down to this
[47:16] creature like that so so that serpent
[47:18] went from a a essentially a glorious
[47:20] being down to this thing that crawled
[47:22] upon the dirt that's why I couldn't find
[47:24] any pictures of what this of because
[47:27] most of the pictures you see are
[47:29] this but this is post curse picture and
[47:32] yet it's a precur situation with Eve
[47:35] talking to a snake right cuz it's like H
[47:37] the curse was that it would become a
[47:38] snake it was different before the curse
[47:41] okay it was a being that could
[47:43] communicate okay so that so now that
[47:46] here's the first curse that happened now
[47:49] uh little question for Bible scholars
[47:51] will either of these be in the new
[47:52] heavens and new earth Reon there be
[47:54] snakes there ugly
[47:57] creatures I don't know I don't know all
[48:00] all or the the the serpent because it
[48:02] was a creation of God I don't know don't
[48:04] know the answer I just sort i' throw
[48:06] that out there if you if you if the
[48:07] brothers want to have a debate one
[48:08] [Laughter]
[48:13] night
[48:15] okay now that now then God then turned
[48:17] his attention to the woman and said
[48:18] because you've done this in pain and
[48:20] travail you'll bring forth children
[48:22] you're going to be you've got you're
[48:23] pregnant now your experience is going to
[48:25] be painful I don't think she experienced
[48:27] pain before that situation right no pain
[48:29] but you says right you're going to have
[48:31] pain and not just that but your hormones
[48:33] are going to be all messed up when you
[48:34] do and you're going to have this you'll
[48:35] have it it'll just be an awful
[48:36] experience to have
[48:38] children and now who now the outcome is
[48:41] nice but probably the experience from
[48:43] what I've experienced isn't very really
[48:45] enjoyable
[48:46] experience
[48:48] okay I haven't had one but I've been
[48:51] pretty close to it and then the other
[48:54] the other curse was your Des I will beat
[48:57] your husband he will rule over you so
[48:59] she was cursed to that state as well
[49:01] that you're no longer going to be what
[49:02] you were before you're coming down a we
[49:04] but your your desire is going to change
[49:06] you're not going to be this your the way
[49:08] you think it's going to be different and
[49:10] and whether people like to accept it or
[49:12] not you get a girls and guys together
[49:14] the guys seem to just be more dominant
[49:16] the girls just seem to take a back seat
[49:18] now they may try and take the front seat
[49:19] but they naturally won't it's just the
[49:22] way that it works try and change it you
[49:25] won't because it's part of the curse the
[49:26] m M alties changed okay accept it or not
[49:29] and that's why Paul says but I suffer
[49:31] not a woman to teach nor upserve
[49:32] authority over a man because he's saying
[49:34] The Curse still remains in place it
[49:36] doesn't hasn't disappeared because
[49:38] time's evolved the curse Still Remains
[49:40] so he says because for Adam was first
[49:43] form in Eve and Adam was not deceived
[49:45] the woman was deceived being deceived
[49:47] was in the transgression okay then he
[49:49] took his eyes over to the man and he
[49:50] said okay now because you've done this
[49:52] curse is the ground for your sake and uh
[49:55] essentially said life for you is going
[49:57] to be hard every time you you that for
[49:59] you to exist as a being now is going to
[50:01] be hard now we say well I don't work on
[50:04] a farm anymore you know because he said
[50:05] you'll have thorns and thistles it'll
[50:07] bring forth but the curse Still Remains
[50:10] even if you work in an office there's a
[50:11] curse against man to make your existence
[50:13] and your the ability to stay alive here
[50:16] hard No Matter What scenario you're
[50:17] working this is a probably a better
[50:19] picture of it here this is now the life
[50:21] man was cursed to live like as you try
[50:24] and push forward you're going to have
[50:25] something pulling you back all the time
[50:26] until the day you die you you're cursed
[50:28] so that's what we live under and you got
[50:30] to try and provide and do these things
[50:31] and it just it just doesn't go your way
[50:34] that's part of the curse right yeah and
[50:36] all creation was cursed at the same time
[50:39] because they they that their world
[50:42] changed and then you had the the Bible
[50:43] says against this will this is a
[50:45] different interpretation but it's just
[50:46] to explain it in a in a in a way bit
[50:48] more against this will all creation was
[50:49] subjected to God's curse but with eager
[50:52] hope that creation looks forward to the
[50:53] day when it will join God's children in
[50:55] glorious freedom from from death and
[50:57] Decay for we know that all creation has
[50:59] been groaning as in the Pains of child
[51:01] birth right up to this present time so
[51:03] creation knows it's under this curse and
[51:06] and this sort of scenario where you've
[51:07] got these animals killing each other is
[51:09] not the way that it was supposed to be
[51:11] this is not normal the these animal
[51:13] these Lions don't like killing those
[51:15] other creatures they do it because
[51:16] they're under the curse but I guarantee
[51:18] in them they don't like it they know
[51:20] that they're not supposed to be like
[51:22] that that all this killing and all this
[51:24] sort of stuff and all these these fields
[51:26] that look like this is not the way that
[51:27] creation was supposed to be it was
[51:29] supposed to be here's a picture that was
[51:32] what it was supposed to be the lion lays
[51:34] down with the lamb they don't just kill
[51:35] each other they love each other the lion
[51:38] eats the grass they just there a it
[51:39] wasn't this whole killing Thorns
[51:41] thistles mess that we've got now that's
[51:44] not creation Now we go shoot animals and
[51:45] do all those things that's all good
[51:47] we're under this curse right but I
[51:49] guarantee there's no going to be no
[51:50] hunters in heaven sorry Bruce but you
[51:52] won't go shoot the animals you know
[51:56] because because it says and we Believers
[51:59] also grown even though we have the Holy
[52:01] Spirit within us as a forest of future
[52:03] Glory we long for our bodies to be
[52:05] released from sin and suffering and from
[52:07] this curse that we live under we too
[52:09] wait with eager hope for the day when
[52:10] God will give us full rights as has
[52:12] adopted children including the new
[52:14] bodies he has promised us this place
[52:15] where the curse will not exist anymore
[52:17] on us on the creatures on anything on
[52:19] woman on man on on everything that we we
[52:21] desire that the and the the the animals
[52:24] of the whole kingdom does as well
[52:25] they're waiting for us to be change can
[52:27] you guys hurry up and change cuz we want
[52:28] to change we don't want to be in the
[52:30] state of this cursed State anymore but
[52:33] the main curse actually that came on
[52:35] which wasn't mentioned there but was
[52:36] mentioned before they did it was the day
[52:37] you eat through of that day you'll die
[52:39] right so that was actually the main
[52:41] curse that happened it didn't actually
[52:42] need to be spoken because it was already
[52:44] spoken so when they did the act it came
[52:46] into Force right and so he says but of
[52:49] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[52:50] Thou shalt not eat of it for the day you
[52:52] wa thereof Thou shalt surely die so the
[52:54] day that Eve the minute Eve took part in
[52:57] that act then then this curse of death
[52:59] struck into her that that curse just
[53:02] ended up there and now now Adam here's
[53:05] Adam Adam had a choice in whether he
[53:06] would go along with it or not but he
[53:08] went willingly he knew what he was doing
[53:11] but he still did it anyway now we're not
[53:12] going to go into the that but we just
[53:15] want to say that Adam ended up like this
[53:18] as well okay so Eve had this curse and
[53:20] Adam did the same thing now if he didn't
[53:22] he would have been all right because Eve
[53:24] was with the serpent he could have said
[53:25] no look not me okay but he did too so we
[53:28] ended up like this and then they had
[53:31] children after that which was Cain and
[53:34] Abel but and Adam called his uh wife's
[53:38] name Eve because we she was now the
[53:39] mother of all living but all living now
[53:42] had this curse this curse of death was
[53:44] just infested in the human race now
[53:47] whether you were from this someone was
[53:48] from the serpent or
[53:51] from uh Adam it didn't matter because
[53:54] they all came via Eve the mother of all
[53:56] living right but you say people think
[53:59] the scripture maybe is not correct
[54:00] because it says God said to the servant
[54:02] I'll put enity between there and the
[54:03] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[54:06] and people say well the woman doesn't
[54:07] have a seed well God made Adam and Eve
[54:10] one he said you'll be one so Eve seed
[54:14] was Adam's son that that's class as
[54:17] that's Eve seed because the serpent was
[54:19] the serpent seed because they weren't
[54:21] together that was the that was uh uh
[54:23] what do you call that um out of wedlock
[54:24] illegitimate son but
[54:27] Eve's seed because they were one was
[54:28] Adam's that's why he said I'll put imity
[54:30] between Cain and Abel between between
[54:32] that seed and that and your seed okay I
[54:33] just wanted to put in there but but the
[54:35] purpose I'm trying to make is that the
[54:37] whole human race ended up with this
[54:39] curse of death on them everybody they
[54:41] have a children children children
[54:43] children grandchildren whatever you you
[54:45] had this whole race that was cursed and
[54:47] this is
[54:48] why there was another law that said the
[54:51] innocent could die for the guilty that
[54:53] that this curse could be undone but yet
[54:56] we the picture before that not that this
[54:57] curse was just infested with everybody
[54:59] that's why Jesus had to come down as a
[55:01] different line outside of that with no
[55:03] curse he turned up without that curse of
[55:05] death there that's why it says a virgin
[55:07] shall conceive because we needed a new
[55:09] human being with blood just like us but
[55:11] not with without part not having any
[55:13] curse in order to undo that curse which
[55:16] was in the the heart of man now we tried
[55:19] to use the blood of bulls and goats to
[55:20] cover over it but it didn't take it away
[55:22] it didn't have the power to because it
[55:23] wasn't the same family we needed K kind
[55:26] we need it same I need someone that
[55:27] looks like me an animal last time I
[55:29] checked a lamb doesn't look like me it
[55:31] looks like a lamb it's got four legs I'm
[55:33] better than a lamb I'm a human being
[55:36] okay now that's why the Bible says
[55:38] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[55:40] of the law yeah being made a curse for
[55:42] us for it is written curse is everyone
[55:44] that HTH on a tree so he hung on the
[55:46] tree on the cross to take the curse from
[55:48] us okay Lord now that's why Paul says
[55:52] but those who depend on the law to make
[55:54] them right with God are under his curse
[55:56] for the scripture says cursed is
[55:57] everyone who does not observe and Obey
[55:59] all the commands that are written in
[56:00] God's book of the law now what he's
[56:02] saying is if you're trying to get rid of
[56:05] that curse by doing good things you
[56:08] there is no way anything no amount of
[56:11] good things you ever can do will ever
[56:13] take away that curse that's sitting in
[56:15] there he's saying that will only be
[56:17] taken away by a perfect one coming and
[56:20] pay paying the price of that that's
[56:22] right so so he's saying if you try and
[56:24] even do good to to to get rid of the
[56:26] curse you're cursed okay so that's
[56:30] that's what he's saying in this respect
[56:31] that's the only way you'll ever get rid
[56:33] of the curse is not by so we need to
[56:34] settle that this morning to get rid of
[56:36] this curse of death in us we need to
[56:38] accept and that's why the Lord's
[56:40] offering is always free moral agency
[56:43] like if you then I that's why you always
[56:45] did it if you obey me and if you don't
[56:46] do that it'll be good but if you do
[56:49] wrong this will happen it's always been
[56:50] like that that's the way God put us on
[56:53] and we feel like oh well I have to do
[56:54] all the work then well not really in
[56:55] this scenario the Lord Lord did all the
[56:56] work he came down paid the whole price
[56:58] he did everything all he said was okay
[57:00] all you have to do is accept it you want
[57:02] to get rid of that curse that's there
[57:04] don't worry about trying to work your
[57:05] way out of it just accept that I've paid
[57:06] the price that's all you have to do if
[57:08] you accept it I will forgive you simple
[57:10] as that done you want it gone then just
[57:14] accept it it's gone okay and so then we
[57:17] end up in the scenario okay yes I accept
[57:19] it then it's gone okay now the curse
[57:21] that curse of death that was in US is
[57:23] undone so that's now that's that that
[57:27] that's now that's dealing with our soul
[57:29] you understand so that now our soul is
[57:31] free from the curse okay now we have
[57:35] this this situation where we need to
[57:38] come down a little bit to now we then
[57:39] exist on this Earth in our body now I
[57:43] need to and this is what I want to try
[57:44] and or I need to emphasize this that
[57:46] these two are not the same what happens
[57:48] in there up in the soul realm it's not
[57:52] really related to what happens down here
[57:54] or vice versa and almost nothing you do
[57:58] here outside of except like no action
[58:01] here will affect your state up
[58:04] there okay I'll show you what I mean
[58:06] because when you you this will will make
[58:09] sense like so we got the first this is
[58:11] generally how the the human how we like
[58:14] to make it simple for ourselves right so
[58:15] we got this person on that side right so
[58:19] they got the curse of death on them
[58:21] usually when they then live in this
[58:22] world because they haven't accepted the
[58:24] lord they're not interested in it then
[58:26] they will then live outside of his word
[58:28] on this realm and then get a curse in
[58:31] this realm because the Curse still
[58:33] applies if you go outside my word you'll
[58:35] be cursed so so you steal you'll be
[58:37] cursed I'll get to that for argument
[58:39] sake so when they live in this realm
[58:41] they generally will be cursed as well
[58:44] okay generally speaking the next one is
[58:47] okay if someone on that side the curse
[58:49] is gone the curse of death is gone that
[58:52] will usually manifest into this realm
[58:54] that hey I want to follow the word of
[58:55] God live in inside his word do what I'm
[58:57] supposed to do you'll be blessed in this
[59:00] realm you know you things would just go
[59:02] slightly better for you than for than
[59:04] the cursed guy beside you
[59:06] okay however sometimes you can have
[59:09] someone that is that hasn't had the sin
[59:12] question settled over there and yet they
[59:14] can be blessed in this realm it's like
[59:17] that's why brother Adam was so against
[59:18] people that came in and said I come and
[59:20] shake hands with the pastor put your
[59:21] name in the book and you're in because
[59:23] he knew the sin question wasn't settled
[59:25] and then you go try and live a good life
[59:26] and you feed the the the poor and you do
[59:29] all these things now they live a life
[59:31] that's blessed and yet the sin question
[59:32] is not settled see so they can be
[59:35] blessed here and cursed there right and
[59:38] now the next person is somebody can
[59:40] actually be have the sin question
[59:42] settled and live the most horrible
[59:44] failure of a life here and just continue
[59:45] to fail until almost the day they die
[59:47] they never want to but they just for
[59:49] whatever reason they try their best they
[59:50] always sin their and it seems like they
[59:52] live a cursed life and they they
[59:54] actually could live a life that brings
[59:56] so much cursing on them but remember
[59:58] that doesn't affect their state over
[1:00:00] there you'd say well they wouldn't do
[1:00:01] that if they knew better these are
[1:00:04] anomalies sometimes people maybe they've
[1:00:05] done a lot of drugs and they just can't
[1:00:06] function properly in things and they
[1:00:08] just their life just seems to be a
[1:00:10] complete curse yet yet their soul their
[1:00:12] sin question is
[1:00:14] settled okay because these don't affect
[1:00:16] one another they don't they don't affect
[1:00:19] each other now that's why when you get
[1:00:21] to this this verse here that that Paul
[1:00:23] said when he talks about those that
[1:00:25] depend on the law to make them right
[1:00:27] with God are under the curse because he
[1:00:29] says curse everyone that does not
[1:00:31] observe and Obey all the laws that are
[1:00:33] written in God's book now this verse
[1:00:35] relates in two ways when he's saying it
[1:00:37] that way he's saying in terms of trying
[1:00:38] to get rid of the curse in your
[1:00:40] soul you cannot do it so that doing the
[1:00:43] law will not get rid of that curse but
[1:00:45] yet the curse of the still stands for
[1:00:48] someone for when we live here if you
[1:00:50] don't observe the laws when you're here
[1:00:52] you'll be
[1:00:53] cursed okay but if You observe them when
[1:00:56] you're here you'll be
[1:00:57] blessed that make sense right it it it
[1:01:01] it does so this scripture applies here
[1:01:03] but trying to make your soul uncursed by
[1:01:05] using the scripture to apply to that
[1:01:06] doesn't work you you got that there's
[1:01:09] only one scenario here almost every
[1:01:13] action you do on this Earth will not
[1:01:15] affect your spiritual the the state over
[1:01:16] there almost every action there's only
[1:01:18] one action you can do here in this body
[1:01:20] that will affect your state over there
[1:01:22] and that
[1:01:23] is I'll get to what it is but brother
[1:01:26] bam talked about that for a bit here and
[1:01:28] he said you know he said there's only
[1:01:29] one thing and he said he said I his
[1:01:31] mother used to think it was abortion she
[1:01:33] would say my mother used to because she
[1:01:34] didn't know any better she said it's a
[1:01:37] woman that would before child birth
[1:01:39] would have an abortion case taking the
[1:01:40] life of an innocent baby who didn't have
[1:01:42] a chance to be brought forth into the
[1:01:43] world his mother thought oh the the the
[1:01:45] sin you can commit here to make you not
[1:01:47] get in over there is abortion you have
[1:01:49] you bought a baby you're done that's not
[1:01:51] true you can have bought a 100 babies
[1:01:54] and be absolutely saved
[1:01:57] that's that's that's the truth this it's
[1:01:59] not the unforgivable sin now that you
[1:02:00] might say well that no one should have
[1:02:02] bought babies I know that but I'm saying
[1:02:04] they can and they will still be saved
[1:02:05] right because you got to stay with the
[1:02:07] word of God you can't just decide on
[1:02:09] your own mind oh I think this because
[1:02:10] it's it seems cruel that's not how it
[1:02:12] works or even here's another one that
[1:02:14] maybe I've had to think about this is
[1:02:17] suicide he said my father differ with
[1:02:18] you he said it's a man that would take
[1:02:20] his own life if that man takes his own
[1:02:21] life he's insane and he can never get to
[1:02:22] heaven cuz he committed suicide but that
[1:02:25] still is not the truth
[1:02:26] a person can commit suicide and be saved
[1:02:28] because it's not the unforgivable sin
[1:02:30] the unforgivable sin is bless me of the
[1:02:32] Holy Ghost which is actually pushing
[1:02:35] back and and despising the very thing
[1:02:37] that's trying to save your
[1:02:38] soul it's saying I don't want that it's
[1:02:40] an unclean thing I'm not into that at
[1:02:42] all just just despising that you you do
[1:02:45] that there's no forgiveness here or the
[1:02:46] world to come that's the only thing but
[1:02:49] every other sin you commit you could
[1:02:50] abort a 100 babies and kill yourself and
[1:02:52] you'll make
[1:02:53] it right that sounds rough but accept it
[1:02:56] because it's the truth but don't do
[1:02:59] it
[1:03:01] okay we have to stay now that's why now
[1:03:05] that's why we get these scenarios where
[1:03:06] where you know we may become unequally
[1:03:09] yolked I just want to put this in there
[1:03:10] because you can now see the
[1:03:11] situation generally speaking if you have
[1:03:14] this scenario and you're unequally
[1:03:15] yolked with an
[1:03:17] unbeliever spir in the spiritual realm
[1:03:19] it's going to be a little bit tricky for
[1:03:20] you then in the natural realm most of
[1:03:22] the time you're going to be you got a
[1:03:24] bless life the unbelievers a cursed life
[1:03:26] it's going to create problems you know
[1:03:29] that's just in this world you're going
[1:03:30] to create problems but Paul said look if
[1:03:34] you find yourself in this situation and
[1:03:35] you're happy then just go along with it
[1:03:37] it's all good yeah if you can survive
[1:03:39] like this and you enjoy it that's fine
[1:03:42] but he said if you don't if you're
[1:03:44] living in the situation and you don't
[1:03:45] enjoy it it's not working for you then
[1:03:48] you don't have to carry on in this
[1:03:49] situation because this is a scenario
[1:03:50] someone may find themselves in now cuz
[1:03:53] when we're talking about the bottom
[1:03:54] stuff we're now talking about quity of
[1:03:56] life and your reward over there and all
[1:03:58] these things that's what we're dealing
[1:03:59] with we're not dealing with I do more
[1:04:01] stuff therefore I'm more saved that's
[1:04:03] dealing with the curse this here is
[1:04:05] dealing with your quality of life how
[1:04:07] things EV all fa for you whether they go
[1:04:09] good or bad or up or down that's now
[1:04:11] what we deal with in blessing or cursing
[1:04:13] and that's very simple stay within his
[1:04:14] word you'll be blessed go outside you'll
[1:04:15] be cursed very very simple okay but but
[1:04:18] we're now dealing with the things we do
[1:04:20] here that have an effect only here only
[1:04:23] here and there to a degree cuz you get a
[1:04:25] reward but but this is ideally the way
[1:04:28] we want to be is equally yolked you know
[1:04:30] because then you have this cleaner
[1:04:31] situation but it's not always the case
[1:04:33] because the world is not a clean
[1:04:35] organized place okay that's the way that
[1:04:38] it is we don't live in an organized
[1:04:39] world where everything is perfect it's
[1:04:40] not the way that it goes here and I'm
[1:04:42] happy with that I'm happy that people
[1:04:44] can just press on in the Lord whatever
[1:04:45] state they find themselves in just press
[1:04:46] on in the Lord I'm happy with that
[1:04:49] that's what we do what does it all
[1:04:50] matter anyway deal with that sin
[1:04:52] question you've won the whole game
[1:04:54] anyway who cares who cares what hand you
[1:04:56] got
[1:04:57] here now but yet and then now we can do
[1:05:01] things here like here this this scenario
[1:05:03] of someone that could be uh cursed in
[1:05:05] their soul they haven't got the sin
[1:05:07] question settled but they live an
[1:05:08] outstanding life here and they they
[1:05:09] they're just so diligent on what they're
[1:05:10] doing they they these Sports people and
[1:05:12] that that are so uh they they win things
[1:05:15] and they they what's the word when you
[1:05:17] when you're on time for like you meet
[1:05:18] all go to all your training and all that
[1:05:20] and you dedicated and they're you know
[1:05:22] they're they're committed and they just
[1:05:24] they work so hard for for something that
[1:05:26] they love they do that in their natural
[1:05:27] human ability so I think if a natural
[1:05:30] human man can do that I should do the
[1:05:32] same for the Lord cuz that's what this
[1:05:33] now comes down to we are our natural you
[1:05:35] know if we really think well the Lord's
[1:05:37] my God we will naturally want to do the
[1:05:38] best we can here and human beings have
[1:05:40] got an ability to do very well because
[1:05:43] they've proven it that even this person
[1:05:44] that lives under a curse can still do
[1:05:46] really well on this Earth okay does that
[1:05:49] make sense because we don't want to be
[1:05:51] lazy or be just here and go well you
[1:05:53] know we can do a lot better always than
[1:05:55] what we
[1:05:56] right now here I just want to bring this
[1:05:58] to the natural thing now naturally
[1:06:01] speaking now on this Earth if you live
[1:06:03] inside the word of God you'll be blessed
[1:06:05] if you go outside the word of God you'll
[1:06:06] be cursed now you can live a cursed life
[1:06:09] and still be saved you understand when I
[1:06:10] say curs it's like well I'm cursed I'm
[1:06:12] out that doesn't actually work like that
[1:06:15] okay
[1:06:17] okay now that's why when when when um
[1:06:21] the children of Israel went into the
[1:06:22] land God said if you do well I'll bless
[1:06:24] you everything work yeah you I'll defeat
[1:06:27] your reion you'll do well if you if you
[1:06:29] do sinfully then everything will start
[1:06:31] going bad for you but you're in the land
[1:06:34] okay but your experience in the land is
[1:06:36] going to be determined by your actions
[1:06:39] right but you're still in the land
[1:06:40] You're Going To Live and Die in the land
[1:06:41] most of the time but okay so now now now
[1:06:46] I just want to give you an example so
[1:06:47] just to drive this point home like if
[1:06:49] you honor your parents you'll be blessed
[1:06:51] now that's actually the first
[1:06:52] commandment that the it's the first
[1:06:54] commandment with promise saying if you
[1:06:56] do this you'll be blessed that's
[1:06:58] actually a Commandment that is more than
[1:06:59] just oh well you may be it it actually
[1:07:01] is if you honor your parents you will be
[1:07:04] blessed your life here will be better
[1:07:05] than if you didn't right because if you
[1:07:07] Dison your parents your life is going to
[1:07:08] be slightly worse to what degree I don't
[1:07:11] know but it will be worse because
[1:07:12] there's a cursing that comes with
[1:07:13] dishonoring your parents okay um it says
[1:07:17] it's more blessed to give than to
[1:07:18] receive if you give your life will be
[1:07:20] slightly more blessed than if than if
[1:07:22] you steal your life here your experience
[1:07:24] will be cursed have you noticed people
[1:07:25] that a I can always tell a thief because
[1:07:27] they lock everything you know I park my
[1:07:30] cars out the back leave keys them
[1:07:31] whatever nothing ever happens to my
[1:07:33] stuff my a guy around the corner which
[1:07:35] we all know he dodgy he comes and Parks
[1:07:37] a car around the side where I park my
[1:07:38] car with keys and everything and if ever
[1:07:40] he's left an old wreck there we're
[1:07:41] talking an old wreck that you didn't
[1:07:43] wouldn't even want to steal he's locking
[1:07:44] all the gates oh someone might steal it
[1:07:46] CU I know he's a
[1:07:47] thief and all the stuff gets
[1:07:50] stolen that's the way it works he he
[1:07:52] lives a cursed life none of my stuff
[1:07:53] ever gets stolen if it does Satan's got
[1:07:56] to give it back at some point right okay
[1:08:00] now you be a peacemaker blessed are the
[1:08:01] peacemakers you you create peace you'll
[1:08:04] be blessed if you start conflicts all
[1:08:06] the time you'll be cursed yet that that
[1:08:08] will be your experience in this realm
[1:08:09] now there may be many well meaning good
[1:08:11] Christians that just start conflicts
[1:08:13] that's just their but they got to learn
[1:08:15] okay stop starting conflicts that but it
[1:08:16] might just be their personality and
[1:08:18] God's got to change it but as long as
[1:08:19] they do their experience here will be
[1:08:21] cursed that doesn't mean they're not
[1:08:23] saved that's what we're saying here
[1:08:25] right cuz we all probably do half of
[1:08:27] this stuff you know you know or we
[1:08:30] uplift people you know we there's a
[1:08:32] blessing uplifting people uh there's a
[1:08:35] cursing and slandering of people and
[1:08:36] tearing them down that's that's because
[1:08:37] we don't know what Spirit we're of you
[1:08:39] know uh if we respect God's anointed
[1:08:42] there's a blessing in that even a
[1:08:45] non-Christian if they respect God's
[1:08:46] anointing there's a blessing in that for
[1:08:47] them uh if you if we tear down or hurt
[1:08:50] God's anointed there's a cursing in that
[1:08:53] and sometimes it's a higher degree some
[1:08:55] of these things say you know when a
[1:08:56] little child does something wrong he say
[1:08:58] don't do that again a little little bit
[1:08:59] like that but then if they do something
[1:09:01] really bad they might get two or three
[1:09:02] you know like the the punishment is is
[1:09:05] meat for the the crime if you know what
[1:09:07] I mean like you know in the Lord some
[1:09:08] things are there's a little blip when we
[1:09:10] do something other things you start
[1:09:12] doing this sort of stuff this like
[1:09:13] tearing down God's anointed that that
[1:09:15] that's a quite a high uh you'll be in
[1:09:18] bigger trouble put it that way that that
[1:09:20] that'll bring things on your life that
[1:09:21] you probably don't want okay but if you
[1:09:24] bless the god anointed and respect the
[1:09:26] officers in that God will bless your
[1:09:27] life okay uh you be gracious to people
[1:09:31] blessed are the merciful you'll be
[1:09:32] blessed but if you're unmerciful this
[1:09:35] one probably has a worse a degree the
[1:09:36] people the The Killers you know you
[1:09:38] notice that the Bible says you live by
[1:09:39] the sword you die by the sword you know
[1:09:41] and you notice that usually gangsters
[1:09:43] and guys that have spent their life
[1:09:44] killing people doing this stuff at the
[1:09:45] end they get killed themselves in some
[1:09:47] horrible way and their body just chucked
[1:09:48] out in the in the ocean somewhere just
[1:09:50] in a in a in a in a a a grave a markless
[1:09:54] grave you know cuz that's how that was
[1:09:56] that was the reward of their actions you
[1:09:58] know they don't die nice death on their
[1:10:00] bed family around you know I love you
[1:10:02] it's it's not us yeah sometimes it is
[1:10:04] but they CU not not every reward happens
[1:10:07] here some of it happens over there okay
[1:10:08] so that's why we don't fret when we see
[1:10:10] people doing evil oh why are they
[1:10:12] blessed now and I do this and I get
[1:10:14] cursed seems like you know don't worry
[1:10:16] it will all come out even that's what I
[1:10:18] want you to understand right uh now this
[1:10:20] one here don't commit sexual sin like
[1:10:22] don't be with anyone outside of when you
[1:10:23] get married then you get married I if
[1:10:26] you because if you do if you do that
[1:10:29] you'll if you go outside that you'll be
[1:10:30] cursed and this is the one sin that that
[1:10:32] Paul says all the other sins are without
[1:10:34] your body he said but if you do that
[1:10:36] when you commit it against your own body
[1:10:38] so that's one s where you you actually
[1:10:40] bring some curse directly onto you you
[1:10:43] don't want that don't do that if you
[1:10:45] haven't done it yet don't do it stay
[1:10:47] blessed keep your body blessed you know
[1:10:49] cuz when when when it gets cursed you
[1:10:51] can't
[1:10:52] really you maybe the curse deciat after
[1:10:54] a while but it's just you know if you
[1:10:58] have move on it doesn't affect up there
[1:11:01] okay but it affects here okay so if you
[1:11:03] got if you if you got a chance do the be
[1:11:06] a winner here you know win the best you
[1:11:07] can be the most diligent study the word
[1:11:09] like David said Thy word have I hi in my
[1:11:11] heart that I might not sin against you
[1:11:12] he tried hard he didn't he wasn't lazy
[1:11:15] in his approach he said I'm going to
[1:11:16] read it what does it say what do I do I
[1:11:17] want to get this right I want to be
[1:11:19] blessed and he CU then he could say Lord
[1:11:21] you see the pureness of my heart how
[1:11:22] Lord I've been righteous before you then
[1:11:23] judge me according to my works
[1:11:25] he could be bold before the lord judge
[1:11:28] me Lord I'm righteous oh that's a bit no
[1:11:31] it's the truth when you know you're
[1:11:33] blessed you don't have to worry if Satan
[1:11:34] comes at your messes with your life it's
[1:11:36] all right everything's going to be right
[1:11:37] I'm blessed doesn't look like it brother
[1:11:39] it doesn't matter what it looks like I
[1:11:41] am and that's what job that's what
[1:11:43] happened to job he said I am blessed
[1:11:45] doesn't look like it see and that's why
[1:11:48] we say God's judgments of blessing or
[1:11:50] cursing are just and they're always the
[1:11:51] same they're they're they're always
[1:11:53] correct yeah okay that's why he said be
[1:11:56] not deceived God is Not mocked
[1:11:57] whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also
[1:12:00] reap he said he said it's always going
[1:12:02] to be his judgment is going to be
[1:12:03] perfect the the challenge the issue that
[1:12:06] we have is that now we could say this
[1:12:08] firstly it all balances out right in the
[1:12:10] end but God won't reward good with evil
[1:12:14] okay but he won't reward evil with good
[1:12:17] yeah right but Satan will reward good
[1:12:20] with evil and he will reward evil with
[1:12:23] good he he'll he'll but he's he's
[1:12:27] bringing a curse on himself yeah yeah
[1:12:29] this is important understanding cuz
[1:12:30] people say well I'm blessed you sure
[1:12:32] it's
[1:12:33] God like because if it's outside of his
[1:12:36] word Satan Satan's got the ability to
[1:12:39] bless us with
[1:12:40] things I think I should go this is
[1:12:44] hopefully I get this thought through
[1:12:45] this little bit here because when I was
[1:12:47] thinking it it didn't it I think I'll
[1:12:48] get it across the where I'm supposed to
[1:12:49] be the Lord is honest he says okay if
[1:12:51] you serve me yeah you'll be blessed
[1:12:52] you'll be saved but you'll be persecuted
[1:12:54] uh you'll be out card said if you do
[1:12:56] wrong you'll be punished so you know but
[1:12:59] if you do well you'll be blessed but
[1:13:00] he's honest with us about how it's all
[1:13:01] going to happen and we go y I'm I'm into
[1:13:03] that you know but Satan is deceptive he
[1:13:06] says oh you'll be accepted oh you'll be
[1:13:08] part of the crowd it's all going to be
[1:13:09] all right or you know and then if you go
[1:13:11] and sin he'll try and reward you for
[1:13:13] that to encourage you to keep sinning
[1:13:16] but he's deceptive to to to curse you
[1:13:19] right so so what I'm saying is his
[1:13:21] dealings with us aren't honest they're
[1:13:22] to they're to keep us away they to keep
[1:13:25] us in a cursed State not a blessed state
[1:13:27] right that's why sin is actually
[1:13:30] pleasurable like like that's why so many
[1:13:32] people do it cuz it's pleasurable CU
[1:13:34] it's got to be otherwise no one would do
[1:13:36] it and Satan wouldn't have any success
[1:13:38] okay now let's be honest but it's only
[1:13:40] pleasurable for a
[1:13:41] season like I said it's all going to
[1:13:43] come out in the end everything's going
[1:13:45] to be squared up you live like that
[1:13:47] you'll be cursed oh I'm having a good
[1:13:48] time no we will be squared up at some
[1:13:50] point oh I'm living righteous but it
[1:13:52] seems like everything's just going bad
[1:13:53] for me don't worry it'll all square up
[1:13:55] at some point whether here or there it's
[1:13:56] all going to square up you don't need to
[1:13:58] worry about that okay and that's why
[1:14:01] that's why Moses looked around and he
[1:14:03] and it's the Bible says that he chose to
[1:14:05] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[1:14:07] than to enjoy the passing pleasures of
[1:14:09] sin because they're only for a season
[1:14:11] this this pleasure is just for a season
[1:14:13] at some point it comes to an end and
[1:14:14] there's a Day of Reckoning and he
[1:14:16] thought no I want to throw my lot with
[1:14:18] the Lord's people I want to go with his
[1:14:19] lot cuz I know there's a blessing in
[1:14:21] that I don't want this even though it
[1:14:22] may appear like he could have stayed
[1:14:23] within the house of pharaoh and had it
[1:14:25] but he said no I want to be with the
[1:14:26] Lord now in that case Pharaoh decided to
[1:14:29] go his way and despise the children of
[1:14:31] God and and try to kill them and all
[1:14:33] these things he he and Moses decided to
[1:14:36] go the other way now their Day of
[1:14:38] Reckoning happened here on this Earth
[1:14:39] but it doesn't always happen that way
[1:14:40] there was a Day of Reckoning where
[1:14:41] pharaoh and all his people were drowned
[1:14:42] and God's people walked away that's
[1:14:45] always the way that it works out in the
[1:14:46] end whether here or over there see now
[1:14:50] the reason why I brought that thought in
[1:14:52] before was because because Satan can
[1:14:54] bless to deceive
[1:14:56] and and we got to watch that cuz you'll
[1:14:57] find if you you can boil a lot of false
[1:14:59] Christianity down to Satan just blessing
[1:15:01] to deceive people say this one you know
[1:15:03] God blessed Isaac 100-fold in one year
[1:15:06] wow praise God you know but Isaac was it
[1:15:09] was different like it was just the way
[1:15:12] god Hades with that but here this one
[1:15:15] here this is the Beatles they would have
[1:15:18] got blessed 100 fold in one year Satan
[1:15:20] can offer the same thing and he often
[1:15:22] does oh you you notice all Satan's
[1:15:25] people are wealthy you know see many you
[1:15:27] know see a lot of like the the Great Men
[1:15:29] of the world that are that are evil are
[1:15:31] wealthy cuz Satan owns the wealth and he
[1:15:34] He blesses them as they do his work
[1:15:36] blesses you see it's his Blessing but
[1:15:39] you understand his Blessing is to curse
[1:15:40] them to make them see but God God's
[1:15:43] blessings are always just they're always
[1:15:45] Fair they're always right and it's it's
[1:15:47] never deceptive right or or David said
[1:15:49] you know the story tells about David he
[1:15:51] was taken from a sheep bold and made
[1:15:52] famous you know I'll give you a name
[1:15:53] like the name of Great Men David's not
[1:15:55] the only famous man in the world Satan
[1:15:57] took people like Elvis I'll take you out
[1:15:59] of that those little churchy things and
[1:16:00] make you a great man over here and he
[1:16:02] gave him the same thing but in the end
[1:16:04] these two men there's a reckoning for
[1:16:06] both these men one was blessed one was
[1:16:08] cursed it didn't matter at the time they
[1:16:09] appeared to get the same thing okay uh
[1:16:13] and that's why the thing that that Satan
[1:16:16] tempted Jesus with was I'll bless you
[1:16:18] I'll give you wealth I'll give you this
[1:16:19] I'll give you that you know to bless him
[1:16:21] to get him on a different path But
[1:16:24] ultimately to curse him
[1:16:26] okay so so that's why in this situation
[1:16:29] you got like like job it would appear
[1:16:31] like oh he went from riches to no riches
[1:16:33] so oh it appear like oh job's cursed you
[1:16:36] start watching his life imagine knowing
[1:16:37] job oh you hear what happened to job
[1:16:39] lately or family yeah this family then
[1:16:41] all the family are going oh man things
[1:16:43] are really not going good for them are
[1:16:44] they our natural perception is God's
[1:16:47] cursing
[1:16:49] them uh oh he was really healthy now
[1:16:51] he's just sick no matter what they pray
[1:16:52] for him the man can't heal you know oh
[1:16:55] and that's why his friends came to him
[1:16:57] and they said job it's because you've
[1:16:58] cursed uh because God's cursed you
[1:16:59] because you've done some sin and that's
[1:17:01] why this has come upon you but as I said
[1:17:03] earlier job knew he hadn't am see now
[1:17:06] that's that's why we don't have to worry
[1:17:07] about cursings and that sort of stuff if
[1:17:09] you know you're in the word of God don't
[1:17:11] worry about it it's all going to come
[1:17:12] out right in the end job knew where he
[1:17:15] stood I know where I stand I know who I
[1:17:16] am he knew where he stood he thought no
[1:17:18] I'm blessed I'm living inside the word
[1:17:21] of God I don't care what's happening
[1:17:22] around me I'm blessed his friends always
[1:17:25] convince you no you're not you're cursed
[1:17:27] well if I'm cursed I don't know why
[1:17:29] there's nothing in my heart I'm living
[1:17:31] inside the word of God it's all going to
[1:17:32] be
[1:17:33] right that's the way we need to be and
[1:17:35] have a confidence in the Lord that if
[1:17:37] we're inside his word don't worry about
[1:17:39] what you see because God is going to
[1:17:41] balance everything out eventually okay
[1:17:44] that's like what we said here God won't
[1:17:46] reward good with evil and he won't
[1:17:47] reward evil with good but Satan in job's
[1:17:50] case rewarded evil with good he but you
[1:17:54] see
[1:17:55] in the end it all had to get balanced
[1:17:57] out now in job's case because Satan had
[1:18:00] robbed him he had to pay him back the
[1:18:02] law of uh if you steal you've got to
[1:18:04] restore a certain amount God enforced
[1:18:06] that law on him he said okay okay Satan
[1:18:09] now you are going to pay him back x
[1:18:10] amount plus more because you stole God
[1:18:13] enforced it because everything has to
[1:18:14] come out balanced in the end in that
[1:18:16] situation that's why no curse undeserved
[1:18:19] will
[1:18:20] stand in the same way no blessing
[1:18:22] undeserved will stand okay they cannot
[1:18:25] they cannot exist that they have a a
[1:18:28] curse undeserved will not stand it can't
[1:18:31] become substance it has to eventually be
[1:18:33] undone and a blessing that's undeserved
[1:18:35] has to get undone that's why if you
[1:18:37] stand the word of God just you can rest
[1:18:38] up you be right that's why the scripture
[1:18:40] here says as the bird by wandering as
[1:18:42] the swallow by flying so the curse caus
[1:18:44] shall not come or another version to
[1:18:46] make it un more understandable like a
[1:18:48] fluttering Sparrow or darting swallow
[1:18:50] and undeserved curse will not land on
[1:18:52] its intended victim
[1:18:55] okay that's why the undeserved curse on
[1:18:57] job could not land on him because he
[1:18:59] didn't deserve
[1:19:00] it the undeserved curse cannot so so you
[1:19:04] don't need to there are so many examples
[1:19:06] of this in the Bible like job I just
[1:19:08] said it the undeserved curse could not
[1:19:10] stick with him because he didn't deserve
[1:19:11] it now if he was a sinner his life would
[1:19:14] have gone a certain way he still would
[1:19:15] have been saved but whatever whatever
[1:19:16] you know uh here's another one of balum
[1:19:20] at the point in time the children of
[1:19:21] Israel were blessed now sometimes God
[1:19:23] will allow Satan to yeah have a little
[1:19:24] go other times he says you know what no
[1:19:27] and in this instance he said no but they
[1:19:30] tried to curse the children of Israel
[1:19:33] and the other king said to Bam curse
[1:19:35] them balam tried and all he did was
[1:19:36] blessed because there was a blessing on
[1:19:38] them and he couldn't the curse couldn't
[1:19:40] override the blessing he said I'm trying
[1:19:42] to curse him but I just end up
[1:19:45] blessing at that point in time God
[1:19:47] didn't allow now if God wanted to let
[1:19:48] thisel go through a thing like job he
[1:19:50] would have said okay uh yet curse them
[1:19:51] and it'll come up upon them whatever for
[1:19:53] a while then but even if they did that
[1:19:55] that would have all been undone at some
[1:19:56] point because they didn't deserve the
[1:19:58] curse at that time so that's why balum
[1:20:00] could not curse them okay that's why I
[1:20:02] think maybe people from Africa and that
[1:20:04] you know people get scared about oh you
[1:20:05] heard about the witch doctors all these
[1:20:06] Wizards witches those guys are nonsense
[1:20:10] they don't have any Authority they don't
[1:20:11] have any power they they how can they
[1:20:14] have any authority over you if you're
[1:20:16] inside the word of God they the the
[1:20:20] person they do the most harm to is
[1:20:21] themselves because they bring so many
[1:20:22] curses on themselves by trying to curse
[1:20:25] other letting Satan work through them to
[1:20:26] curse other people they bring so many
[1:20:28] curses on their life I've heard so many
[1:20:29] stories about these people and their
[1:20:31] family line just being sick and diseased
[1:20:32] and they you cannot do this sort of
[1:20:35] stuff and try and curse a good thing and
[1:20:39] live a blessed
[1:20:40] life the these poor men and women have
[1:20:42] given themselves over to the most
[1:20:44] dumbest uh uh
[1:20:46] vocation don't be scared of these people
[1:20:48] they've got
[1:20:50] nothing can I just make that clear these
[1:20:53] witch doctors and these wizards and they
[1:20:54] got nothing they're just little human
[1:20:56] people that think they now the the Satan
[1:20:59] that they serve yes he's powerful he can
[1:21:02] affect things but he's not more powerful
[1:21:04] than the word of God that's why and and
[1:21:07] it's like it's not like God it's not
[1:21:08] like Satan doesn't know who I am if some
[1:21:10] which doctor said oh hey and summons up
[1:21:12] some Demon oh can you try and curse
[1:21:14] Isaac they're like oh Isaac you talking
[1:21:15] about that guy in in uh Wellington that
[1:21:18] Isaac uh yeah tried that uh yeah no uh
[1:21:24] you know you we know him
[1:21:27] H don't think that Satan and demons
[1:21:29] don't already know you and the more you
[1:21:30] do for the Lord the more they know you
[1:21:32] so what's some little witch doctor oh
[1:21:33] hey excuse me can you curse him oh we
[1:21:35] tried you know you understand that's why
[1:21:39] when the sons of uh was it ska said they
[1:21:42] tried to do the stuff and the demon said
[1:21:43] Paul I know Jesus I know I know them
[1:21:46] that's right he knew Paul but Paul could
[1:21:48] carry on his merry way doing his thing
[1:21:50] why cuz he was blessed and and oh I know
[1:21:54] what the and and I I pushed the button
[1:21:56] and Satan
[1:21:59] couldn't Satan you know Satan so that's
[1:22:03] the the here we go so that's the witch
[1:22:05] doctor thing you're not scared of those
[1:22:06] people anymore the Wizards all that
[1:22:07] nonsense no they bring it on themselves
[1:22:09] they've got no power okay amen they do
[1:22:12] have a minor amount of Power with their
[1:22:13] words because we as human beings have
[1:22:15] power in our words I'll get to that
[1:22:16] shortly okay but but just to put that
[1:22:19] all that superstitious stuff to bed if
[1:22:21] you are inside the word of God you're
[1:22:23] worry about nothing
[1:22:25] okay a curse caus this will not come
[1:22:27] don't worry about it it cannot it's
[1:22:29] outside the word of God and even if they
[1:22:31] try it it all it will all get undone and
[1:22:33] the curse will sit where it's supposed
[1:22:34] to in the end okay okay that's that's
[1:22:37] the way that this stuff now I just
[1:22:39] pushed the a little button here
[1:22:41] but now but on the same token because
[1:22:44] now we we deal in blessing not cursing
[1:22:46] right as a Christian but we also have
[1:22:48] the ability to undo a curse that's
[1:22:50] supposed to be there which we have to
[1:22:51] watch that we don't do that and that's
[1:22:53] why Paul said uh seeing that uh Jesus
[1:22:56] said brother vom said seeing that come
[1:22:58] to pass then Lord we're bringing the
[1:22:59] sick tonight to this platform to lay
[1:23:01] hands upon them and pronounce your
[1:23:02] blessing because that's what we do as
[1:23:04] Christians we bless right he says if we
[1:23:06] should lay hands upon something that you
[1:23:08] have cursed God withhold your blessing
[1:23:10] but if everyone has repented of their
[1:23:11] sins and they're ready to receive it I
[1:23:13] pray that you'll heal every person
[1:23:15] that's in your divine presence tonight
[1:23:17] okay that's why the Bible says lay hands
[1:23:19] suddenly on no man because sometimes
[1:23:21] God's doing something and and we go and
[1:23:22] and we we can actually undo that thing
[1:23:24] that God's doing that curse or that or
[1:23:27] that allowance cuz that we can undo that
[1:23:30] and I'm going to be honest with you some
[1:23:31] those people say I'll pray for this
[1:23:32] person I don't pray for that person just
[1:23:34] honest with you because I think I don't
[1:23:36] know who they are from a bar of soap and
[1:23:37] I don't know what sort of Life they're
[1:23:38] living and I don't know why they're in
[1:23:39] that situation what sort of authority
[1:23:41] can I have to approach that and be of
[1:23:43] any use all can be Lord just I pray that
[1:23:46] your perfect will will be worked in that
[1:23:47] situation but I cannot pray directly
[1:23:50] heal that person when I don't know who
[1:23:52] they I don't know why it's on them I
[1:23:53] don't know anything about it I I just I
[1:23:54] just can't fight it on myself to do it
[1:23:56] and even people something you say are
[1:23:58] you sure are you are you sure there's no
[1:24:00] nothing you're happy with your state if
[1:24:02] you're sick you're happy everything's
[1:24:03] good yep brother I'm good I'm no I I I
[1:24:08] want my healing and there's nothing
[1:24:09] that's it's not anything it's just
[1:24:11] Satan's at me whatever you understand
[1:24:14] pray for me but they got to be sure in
[1:24:17] themselves it so but we can undo
[1:24:20] cursings that were supposed to be there
[1:24:22] okay um now here is this one here this
[1:24:25] is just going into these different
[1:24:26] Dynamics we there's this concept that
[1:24:28] you can hand someone over to Satan to
[1:24:30] that they cursed in the body and this
[1:24:31] applies to now in a fellowship when you
[1:24:34] go when you're part of a fellowship and
[1:24:36] and under an anointed Pastor like a
[1:24:38] god-given pastor anointed then there's a
[1:24:40] blessing on your life there's a
[1:24:41] protection there's something on your
[1:24:43] life that happens that you get blessed
[1:24:46] from being that now what what Paul is
[1:24:48] saying is if there's someone sitting in
[1:24:49] there and they're willfully committing
[1:24:51] sin that they know it's wrong you know
[1:24:52] it's wrong even knows it's wrong they
[1:24:53] just continuing on in that now not it's
[1:24:56] there's it's a difference to make a
[1:24:58] mistake and and regret it that's never
[1:25:00] really a it's a sin but like a true a
[1:25:03] True Believer sins all the time you
[1:25:04] always regret it you're like I don't
[1:25:05] want to do that but when someone's in a
[1:25:07] state where they can sin they say I
[1:25:09] don't
[1:25:09] care then that's different that that's
[1:25:12] when the Bible says if we sin willfully
[1:25:14] after we've received the knowledge of
[1:25:15] the truth they Remain the fful now no
[1:25:16] more sacrifice for sin now don't apply
[1:25:18] that will if I think I going to do one
[1:25:19] thing then I'm out forever but it's just
[1:25:21] it's this concept like that man that was
[1:25:23] sinning in this church church that Paul
[1:25:24] was at in the Corinthian Church he was
[1:25:27] willfully sinning and wouldn't do
[1:25:28] anything about it so what so what Paul
[1:25:31] said to do with that man was okay he's
[1:25:33] under a blessing he's under an anointed
[1:25:35] Pastor he's under a blessing you need to
[1:25:37] deliver him over to Satan in his flesh
[1:25:38] you need to get him out of there take
[1:25:40] that blessing off him let his life be
[1:25:42] miserable take it off him put him out
[1:25:45] there so that he learns not to do that
[1:25:48] don't have him doing that and and
[1:25:50] enjoying the blessings of God and living
[1:25:52] sin don't allow that and and and and it
[1:25:55] was a spiritual thing it was Tak him out
[1:25:56] from the blessing even if he comes and
[1:25:58] sits in church the next week the
[1:26:00] blessing could is and he said they it's
[1:26:03] not I'm no longer sitting in the Pew
[1:26:04] it's it's no longer the the the blessing
[1:26:07] is no longer on your life he could sit
[1:26:09] in the Pew and no blessing on his life
[1:26:10] he could sit there for the next 10 years
[1:26:12] and his life's cursed it's just because
[1:26:14] he's he chose that path or she did does
[1:26:17] that make sense that's what this is
[1:26:19] about take them out of that blessing all
[1:26:22] right and that's what God as a father
[1:26:25] like when when his children were in the
[1:26:26] land if they did what was right they
[1:26:29] would be blessed if they did what was
[1:26:31] wrong he would let the wild beasts
[1:26:32] coming would let the other Armies come
[1:26:34] in and just overtake them that's this is
[1:26:38] similar to what we just talked about but
[1:26:39] it's slightly different he would as a
[1:26:40] father say okay you want to do wrong
[1:26:42] then I'll let these people come in all
[1:26:43] you going to do right now I'll drive
[1:26:44] them away right now I want to say this
[1:26:48] because fathers here have the same
[1:26:50] ability to do that you won't like this
[1:26:51] children but the fathers have the
[1:26:53] ability to bless or curse your life I
[1:26:56] don't see many other instances where I
[1:26:57] have the ability over another human
[1:26:58] being to do that but one of them that I
[1:27:00] see because I see God could do that as a
[1:27:02] father he could say you do right I'll
[1:27:04] bless you uh you do wrong I'll curse you
[1:27:08] and let me tell you
[1:27:09] this use this like the last thing I want
[1:27:12] is if I've got an offspring that decides
[1:27:14] to live a life of sin you can be sure is
[1:27:16] anything that's not going to be
[1:27:17] pleasurable for them because if they can
[1:27:20] go out and live a life of sin and Satan
[1:27:21] can make it pleasurable there's a high
[1:27:22] chance of keep on doing it but I think
[1:27:24] the minute you try and go that way I'm
[1:27:26] going to curse your life so much I'm
[1:27:27] going to curse everything you do I'm
[1:27:28] going to curse your health I'm going to
[1:27:30] curse everything I can because you're
[1:27:32] not going to that might sound rough but
[1:27:33] you're not going to go and live a life
[1:27:34] of sin and prosper there is no way you
[1:27:38] think about the what was it the prodigal
[1:27:40] son what made him turn is the fact that
[1:27:42] it all just went totally bad I'm coming
[1:27:45] back that's the way it's going to be for
[1:27:47] any of my Offspring it's going to go
[1:27:48] absolutely bad there's no blessing
[1:27:51] there's no nothing as long as you go
[1:27:53] that way
[1:27:55] now that's the way it's going to be and
[1:27:58] they've seen it you go that way and it
[1:28:00] and it unfolds the way that my mouth
[1:28:02] says it's going to unfold because I know
[1:28:04] who I am I know where I stand I've got
[1:28:05] Authority but you serve God I'll bless
[1:28:07] your life I I'll speak a blessing on it
[1:28:09] and your life's just going to be blessed
[1:28:11] it's going to be richly blessed use that
[1:28:14] little trick okay fathers don't be
[1:28:15] scared it's the authority that you've
[1:28:17] got don't let if they if they if they do
[1:28:20] well bless him if they if they going the
[1:28:22] wrong way don't let Satan get the upper
[1:28:25] hand no it's going to go bad and
[1:28:28] there'll be that prodical sun that will
[1:28:29] come back and I've experienced it cuz I
[1:28:31] said everything is going to go
[1:28:33] bad it's a real thing like and they
[1:28:36] would the the the the fathers and in the
[1:28:39] old time they were bless and curse you
[1:28:41] know okay that's the authority that we
[1:28:42] have okay use that little trick now
[1:28:45] we've got this thing called inherited
[1:28:47] blessings or cursings this is something
[1:28:48] that maybe we get confused about but
[1:28:50] when you look into it you're like okay
[1:28:51] yeah well I guess it's the way that it
[1:28:53] is
[1:28:54] and I but I didn't really understand
[1:28:56] this I thought this kind of wasn't fair
[1:28:57] for a while I'm like how's that fair I
[1:28:58] did nothing I turned up and then I got
[1:28:59] to deal with all this other stuff that
[1:29:01] other people did how's that fair on me
[1:29:02] you know just as a intellectual
[1:29:05] standpoint but the Bible says Thou shalt
[1:29:07] not bow thyself down unto them nor serve
[1:29:09] them talking of the Gods for I the Lord
[1:29:10] thy God am a jealous God visiting the
[1:29:12] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[1:29:14] children unto the th third and fourth
[1:29:16] generation of them that hate me and
[1:29:18] showing Mercy unto thousands of them
[1:29:20] that love me and keep my Commandments
[1:29:22] now that translation is actually if you
[1:29:24] sin I'll visit that to the third and
[1:29:26] fourth generation your sin but if you do
[1:29:28] right I'll I'll bless I'll visit that on
[1:29:30] a thousand
[1:29:31] Generations like yeah so Lord Lord if
[1:29:34] there's someone within a thousand
[1:29:35] Generations back to me that's being
[1:29:37] righteous I accept that
[1:29:38] blessing somewhere on my life got to be
[1:29:40] someone
[1:29:41] somewhere even if I come from a big line
[1:29:43] of pagans one of them somewhere has got
[1:29:44] to be was loved you Lord and I'll take
[1:29:46] that blessing back a thousand
[1:29:49] Generations may his favor be upon you in
[1:29:51] a thousand Generations that's what
[1:29:53] that's about you know but now when we
[1:29:56] look at this this is the truth is that
[1:29:58] your body is not yours that I was
[1:30:02] supposed to write that it's not actually
[1:30:03] yours you completely inherited it from
[1:30:05] your father and mother there's no part
[1:30:06] of it that's yours you you were the
[1:30:09] spirit that came in but your body was
[1:30:11] like it was made from someone else and
[1:30:13] you went and lived in it so everything
[1:30:15] that they were you had to move
[1:30:19] into that's why every everything they've
[1:30:23] done up to that point
[1:30:24] gets like a little portion of goes and
[1:30:26] makes another little thing everything
[1:30:28] they are is there that's why you inherit
[1:30:31] whatever sins blessings whatever you
[1:30:33] because it's them like my body is not my
[1:30:36] my body's my parents so is yours it's
[1:30:39] not actually yours
[1:30:41] right when you think about your it's
[1:30:43] actually correct sounds rough but it's
[1:30:45] correct right now here is a here is the
[1:30:49] third and fourth generation actually
[1:30:50] means five lines cuz it's like Grand uh
[1:30:54] son grandson great grandson great great
[1:30:56] grandson that's that's four generations
[1:30:58] from you and if I went from me here this
[1:31:01] would be this would be that back when I
[1:31:04] counted it I realized I've got 30 people
[1:31:06] that lived on this world that that
[1:31:08] directly affected My outcome here 30
[1:31:12] right cuz that's the your grandparents
[1:31:14] great grandparents and great grand
[1:31:16] grandparents here 15 men and 15 women so
[1:31:18] you all have the same amount as me
[1:31:20] you've got 15 men and 15 women that have
[1:31:22] affected your existence here
[1:31:24] how do you feel about
[1:31:27] that hey but depends what line you come
[1:31:31] from you know I say to David you guys
[1:31:33] your third generation of blessing you
[1:31:35] know that's coming on you my father
[1:31:37] turned the tide of paganism and just
[1:31:38] ungodliness and and in our line and then
[1:31:41] he and and I was able to live a little
[1:31:42] bit better then then I've turned it a
[1:31:43] bit more to my son cuz that the cursing
[1:31:46] or blessings go either way okay but but
[1:31:50] they can be undone okay it's not like
[1:31:52] but but you are just going to in he some
[1:31:54] of them and it's just you know but the
[1:31:56] blessings also come down that's why
[1:31:58] Abraham it said it said Paul said of
[1:32:00] Levi he said Levi also he who received
[1:32:03] tithes paid tithes and Abraham he's
[1:32:05] saying Le and now now Abraham was here
[1:32:07] and Abraham paid tithe but because
[1:32:09] Abraham carried on an existence down to
[1:32:11] Levi Abraham was in Levi then he says
[1:32:15] that tithe paying was attributed to Levi
[1:32:18] Levi you paid tithe I did
[1:32:20] WOW Levi's body paid tithe so he got
[1:32:24] because he paid tithe and he didn't give
[1:32:25] $1 and yet because because he was an
[1:32:28] Abraham then he paid tithe and because
[1:32:31] it it was only back we're only talking
[1:32:32] the third one so he still had he could
[1:32:34] claim one more line he could claim um
[1:32:36] Abraham's parents you know bit more
[1:32:37] there you understand okay now that may
[1:32:41] sound a bit like oh negative but what
[1:32:44] you have is choice you don't that's what
[1:32:47] you have when you get this body you have
[1:32:48] choice of them what you do with it yeah
[1:32:51] however it's given to you whatever it is
[1:32:53] what it is you know you can try and undo
[1:32:54] those but and you can do things you can
[1:32:56] cut them off your life and those sort of
[1:32:58] things but what you do have is choice of
[1:33:00] what you do now with that land they gave
[1:33:02] it to you but you then live in it you
[1:33:03] say right I'm going to decide now what I
[1:33:05] do with this now whether you get a nice
[1:33:07] bit or a messy bit I've seen many people
[1:33:10] that have that started that got a nice
[1:33:12] slot and ended up with a mess and I've
[1:33:14] seen many that started off with a mess
[1:33:15] and ended up with a glorious thing
[1:33:17] that's what God does if you decide look
[1:33:20] Lord I want you to bless me he'll bless
[1:33:21] your land he'll bless your life he'll
[1:33:23] he'll turn it all around and he's got
[1:33:24] he's he's a Creator Lord bless me create
[1:33:27] Lord take this ugly Rock that's like
[1:33:29] that I got handed no life on it just a
[1:33:31] line of evil paganism take that Lord and
[1:33:34] bless it and God will bless it only took
[1:33:36] him seven days to make the world you
[1:33:39] know he's got he's got your lifetime's
[1:33:41] going to be enough to bless it to make
[1:33:42] it something you know so okay I want to
[1:33:46] explain to you this here this is just a
[1:33:48] little side thought but this now applies
[1:33:50] to humanity as a whole cuz I've always
[1:33:52] thought there's something about the baby
[1:33:54] boom of the 50s generation there's
[1:33:55] something about that generation that
[1:33:56] have sort of had it the best out of
[1:33:58] anybody in the existence almost of the
[1:33:59] world right and then I researched it and
[1:34:02] it said the year 1956 has been voted the
[1:34:04] best year in which to be born with
[1:34:06] Children of the 1950s more content than
[1:34:08] any subsequent Generations according in
[1:34:10] new research a staggering 88% of those
[1:34:12] born in the 1950s admit that their
[1:34:14] generation has been luckier than others
[1:34:16] Which is far more than those born in
[1:34:18] later
[1:34:19] decades what year were you born 46 okay
[1:34:23] you're you're soon not as blessed as
[1:34:24] this
[1:34:25] [Laughter]
[1:34:27] group sorry bro it's all right you made
[1:34:31] up for it by the the Lord made up for
[1:34:34] it okay now we're going to apply the
[1:34:37] principle of four to five generations
[1:34:39] because what the generations did before
[1:34:41] that Came Upon and Came Upon and and if
[1:34:45] you look at this if if you and I'm I'm
[1:34:47] probably talking more about Western
[1:34:48] countries countries that embraced
[1:34:50] Christianity
[1:34:52] right this goes back about 100 years so
[1:34:54] you think from 1850 it was always I
[1:34:56] would say now we now Solomon says don't
[1:34:59] look back and think the older times were
[1:35:01] better than these times but in a
[1:35:02] spiritual sense there was a lot less
[1:35:04] evil there than what there is now right
[1:35:06] so you've got this generation say that
[1:35:08] was born in 1850 and and these Western
[1:35:09] countries you know I know these more I
[1:35:11] can't speak for other countries but I
[1:35:12] know these countries and I know their
[1:35:14] history and you can see godliness coming
[1:35:16] so you can see a wave of godly people
[1:35:18] come in they have children a bigger wave
[1:35:20] of godliness they have children a bigger
[1:35:22] wave of godliness still maybe someone
[1:35:25] born in in like that's supposed to be uh
[1:35:28] sorry
[1:35:29] 1925 the the the the the culture around
[1:35:32] the time Western countries was Godly so
[1:35:34] they so you can imagine you've got a
[1:35:36] buildup of blessing coming upon so this
[1:35:38] generation that was bornn in the 50s had
[1:35:40] a buildup like if you went back further
[1:35:42] 17 1600s it was a little bit weird in
[1:35:45] there but as it as it came good four to
[1:35:47] five generations later you had this
[1:35:49] generation born on the Earth that that
[1:35:50] just had like a influx of blessing on
[1:35:53] their life
[1:35:54] they inherited a world that had been
[1:35:57] blessed by the previous
[1:35:59] generations but what did they do with
[1:36:02] it Satan knew they were blessed too and
[1:36:05] he worked so hard to destroy
[1:36:07] it and from when they were born they
[1:36:10] they were they were teenagers in the 60s
[1:36:12] what happened in the 60s things got
[1:36:13] worse and 65 was you know the middle of
[1:36:16] the 60s these guys were 15 16 17 they
[1:36:19] just started Living in sin and they
[1:36:20] started doing all that and then by 75
[1:36:23] day children and the children are going
[1:36:24] to inherit some of the blessing but some
[1:36:26] of the cursing and then those children
[1:36:28] they the 75 people graph and they get
[1:36:30] worse and worse until the next
[1:36:31] Generation comes they get worse so
[1:36:34] instead of having a buildup of blessing
[1:36:35] you're now having a slow buildup of
[1:36:37] cursing coming upon the Earth generation
[1:36:41] after generation and it only takes 100
[1:36:42] years for this generation is 100 years
[1:36:45] to change the whole landscape of the
[1:36:47] earth 100 Years and we're we got what
[1:36:50] the one born now is by the end of it we
[1:36:53] should be pretty well when this one born
[1:36:56] today when they're 25 it' be pretty well
[1:36:58] done right and that's why brother Bram
[1:37:01] said and people today the teenagers out
[1:37:02] in high school with beer parties and
[1:37:04] drinking and living in little girls
[1:37:05] living in adultery little boys and
[1:37:06] things like that what kind of a
[1:37:08] generation is coming after coming up
[1:37:10] after that what makes these little girls
[1:37:11] act like this their mommy was a flapper
[1:37:13] their grandmam was a chorus girl and he
[1:37:15] said he would visit the iniquity of the
[1:37:17] parents upon the children and the
[1:37:18] children's children to the third and
[1:37:19] fourth generation what can you expect
[1:37:22] anymore and when the the whole thing
[1:37:23] begin to leak out and the righteous seed
[1:37:25] begins sitting on the side Getting
[1:37:27] Thinner and thinner and the wicked just
[1:37:29] keep on very religious just keep getting
[1:37:30] Wicked the whole generation getting more
[1:37:32] and more wicked and cursed he said and
[1:37:35] wickeder and wickeder there's nothing to
[1:37:36] do but to destroy the whole thing like
[1:37:38] he did back there in the anti dovian
[1:37:40] destruction all right every thought of
[1:37:43] man is continually full of sin
[1:37:45] everything man thinks about today is a
[1:37:47] bottle of whiskey or some woman or out
[1:37:49] running around can't love true to their
[1:37:50] wives the boys can't love true to the
[1:37:51] girls girls can't love true to the boys
[1:37:53] why they're in such a place to the de
[1:37:55] the devil has got them so bound and
[1:37:56] possessed with evil spirits the whole
[1:37:58] thing has become a conglomeration of sin
[1:38:01] a buildup that's the reason we're in the
[1:38:03] day and that's the reason that Russia is
[1:38:05] playing exactly in the hands of God to
[1:38:07] rock this thing out here out of here the
[1:38:09] Bible says so certainly God is using
[1:38:10] communism he will use Comm he will use
[1:38:12] it communism will destroy the entire
[1:38:14] thing according to the scripture and
[1:38:15] we're in that
[1:38:17] day the buildup of a cursing on Humanity
[1:38:21] you can't see there's there's that's why
[1:38:23] I say you can't live wrong and think
[1:38:25] it's all going to be
[1:38:26] right the curses all have to be balanced
[1:38:28] out that everything gets balanced out
[1:38:30] and there's a reckoning for
[1:38:32] everything and that's why in the 50s and
[1:38:34] 60s they thought this is great we're
[1:38:35] having a good time and everything's
[1:38:36] still going good yeah it will for you
[1:38:38] cuz you you've got overflow blessing you
[1:38:40] let the generation go further and
[1:38:41] further on you watch what it's doing you
[1:38:43] just enjoyed like some person hereit a
[1:38:45] business got a whole lot of money some
[1:38:47] usually the the the parents build it the
[1:38:49] second generation milk it the third
[1:38:51] generation destroy it that's generally
[1:38:53] the the life of a family business very
[1:38:55] rare if they go outside of that and it's
[1:38:57] the same with us you know these the
[1:38:58] generation came along with this blessing
[1:39:00] ah look everything's going well sweet we
[1:39:01] just party up they milked this blessing
[1:39:03] out of there and just did Sin then they
[1:39:05] passed the sin on and then the next
[1:39:06] Generation right and as we're speaking
[1:39:09] to pick up the little subject again just
[1:39:10] now for a minute now how the legitimate
[1:39:13] child could not enter the kingdom for 14
[1:39:14] Generations 400 years and how that the
[1:39:16] iniquity of the parents was visit to the
[1:39:18] children to the third and fourth
[1:39:20] generation and this one and the
[1:39:22] righteousness of the parents was
[1:39:24] visited what you do if there is a coming
[1:39:26] tomorrow and you have a great grandson
[1:39:28] your action today will determine what
[1:39:30] he'll be then so the very things you're
[1:39:33] doing are going to determine your great
[1:39:34] great grandson's
[1:39:36] outcome right
[1:39:38] now and then and this is just down
[1:39:40] further in that quote and then this
[1:39:42] young C generation running around
[1:39:43] smoking drinking and everything how do
[1:39:45] you expect another generation to exist
[1:39:46] the reason we got s the juvenile
[1:39:48] delinquency now the reason we got little
[1:39:50] girls on the street and little boys is
[1:39:51] because their mothers and daddies did
[1:39:53] what they did in their bygone age and
[1:39:55] the reason we still got preachers who
[1:39:57] still stand for truth the reason we
[1:39:58] still got some oldfashioned girls is
[1:39:59] because they had oldfashioned Parents
[1:40:01] behind them that's exactly right we
[1:40:03] still got preachers that stands
[1:40:04] uncompromising with any denomination or
[1:40:07] the word is because we've had is we we
[1:40:10] had oldfashioned preachers in the back
[1:40:11] stood right on the same ground yes
[1:40:15] see okay
[1:40:17] now I've almost done here we've got this
[1:40:20] concept of blessed countries there is a
[1:40:22] concept of blessed countri count not
[1:40:23] many cuz there sort of a few they I but
[1:40:26] there is a country that's that's
[1:40:27] eternally blessed and that's Israel that
[1:40:30] because that's God's people that's God's
[1:40:31] country so they're they're one of the
[1:40:33] ones that they're going to be eternally
[1:40:34] blessed you know and that's why it says
[1:40:36] if you bless them you'll be blessed if
[1:40:38] you curse them you'll be cursed often
[1:40:40] thought a business I might import
[1:40:41] Israeli goods and sell them you know to
[1:40:42] help the country then I'll be blessed
[1:40:43] you know I'll bless Israel you know so
[1:40:47] if you see anything made in Israel just
[1:40:48] buy it you know God will bless you or
[1:40:50] pray for them you know like do things to
[1:40:52] bless Israel you'll be blessed if you
[1:40:54] curse him you'll be cursed what's
[1:40:56] happening today there's so much cursing
[1:40:58] on Israel they just they're cursing it
[1:41:00] shouldn't exist the whole the world is
[1:41:02] cursing Israel what are they bringing on
[1:41:04] them a curse there Satan's played it off
[1:41:07] like Israel's bad and everyone else is
[1:41:10] good but he knows he's only bringing all
[1:41:12] the world into a curse he knows that
[1:41:13] he's deceiving them to bring them into a
[1:41:16] curse okay now we got blessed and cursed
[1:41:19] cities um there's a city called
[1:41:22] Jerusalem that's blessed and there's a
[1:41:23] city called Jericho that was cursed cuz
[1:41:25] Joshua said cursed is and Joshua adjured
[1:41:28] them at their time and said cursed be
[1:41:29] the man before the Lord that raiseth up
[1:41:31] and buth the City Jericho so Jericho was
[1:41:33] always going to be a cursed City anyone
[1:41:34] that built some more stones to build a
[1:41:35] town there is going to be cursed and and
[1:41:38] then brother B tells a story about the
[1:41:40] the man that in the end the um Good
[1:41:42] Samaritan helped him he said he was on
[1:41:43] his way from Jerusalem to Jericho he was
[1:41:45] going from the Blessed City to a cursed
[1:41:46] City and he likened it he said look
[1:41:48] that's about the way it is in their life
[1:41:49] you know when we go from the blessings
[1:41:50] of God and we start wandering out to
[1:41:52] these cursed places is that's when all
[1:41:54] the trouble starts you know we along the
[1:41:56] way somewhere you know when we're
[1:41:57] heading in that direction and that was
[1:41:58] where that man found himself heading
[1:42:00] from a blessed City to a cur City uh
[1:42:02] there's a city called capernium that
[1:42:05] Jesus lived at when he was he he moved
[1:42:07] to capernium may maybe late teens or at
[1:42:09] some point he moved there and it says
[1:42:11] and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt
[1:42:13] in capernum which is by the sea in the
[1:42:14] regions of nebulon and naftali that it
[1:42:17] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:42:19] isias the prophet saying the land of
[1:42:21] zebulun and the land of nephal by the
[1:42:23] way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of
[1:42:25] the Gentiles the people which sat in
[1:42:27] darkness saw great light and to them
[1:42:28] which sat in the region and the shadow
[1:42:31] of death light has sprung up so now
[1:42:33] here's this area that the Son of God
[1:42:34] went and lived at and then the Bible
[1:42:36] says they're blessed because the light
[1:42:38] came and that that area is blessed there
[1:42:41] are many miracles happened there that's
[1:42:42] where Peter's mother-in-law was held in
[1:42:44] capernium
[1:42:45] okay uh you know the nobleman's son
[1:42:47] healed he said pray for my son he said
[1:42:49] Your son's healed and then the man
[1:42:51] walked back to his house and the
[1:42:53] servants met him along the way and said
[1:42:54] oh your son's been healed and he said oh
[1:42:56] what time was it they said it was about
[1:42:57] this time and it was the same time Jesus
[1:42:59] said he was healed right that was that
[1:43:01] was this miracle happened in capernium
[1:43:03] uh the Centurion that said uh uh he you
[1:43:07] know he my servant he said but then you
[1:43:09] know that this story when the Centurion
[1:43:10] said he needs to be healed but you don't
[1:43:12] need to go there I'm you're a man I'm a
[1:43:14] man under Authority like you just speak
[1:43:16] the word and it'll happen that happened
[1:43:17] in capernium
[1:43:19] okay um and Jar's daughter that was
[1:43:21] healed that that was in capernium and
[1:43:25] and Jesus preached many times in
[1:43:27] capernium did all these
[1:43:28] Miracles but yet the the people in
[1:43:31] capernum rejected
[1:43:32] him and this town had so much light
[1:43:35] there and that's why that's why Jesus
[1:43:36] said and then he said and now capernum
[1:43:38] which out exal to Heaven Thou shalt be
[1:43:39] brought down to hell for if the mighty
[1:43:41] Works which have been done in thee had
[1:43:43] been done in Sodom would have remain
[1:43:44] unto this day said look what's happened
[1:43:46] here you've got all this blessing and
[1:43:48] you chose to despise it he said your
[1:43:50] your city is finished capernium to this
[1:43:52] day doesn't stand doesn't
[1:43:54] exist doesn't exist it just it ruins
[1:43:57] that's capernium there the Glamorous
[1:43:58] city of God you know where the Lord
[1:44:00] lived it's ruins because it's cursed
[1:44:03] don't you know some developers don't buy
[1:44:05] land there you know thinking oh let's
[1:44:06] let's you know let's grow the city it'll
[1:44:09] never grow everything will go wrong for
[1:44:11] it because it's cursed it's it's always
[1:44:13] going to be cursed and I can only really
[1:44:16] name two cities which is Rome is cursed
[1:44:18] and this I can name the city of Los
[1:44:20] Angeles that's we can definitely say
[1:44:21] that city is cursed but actually America
[1:44:24] because you think of all the Miracles
[1:44:26] that God did all around the country and
[1:44:28] they slowly rejected them that the whole
[1:44:29] country as a whole has got a curse we
[1:44:31] don't get out of it CU we've all slowly
[1:44:33] rejected it too but but that was the
[1:44:35] epicenter of the Miracles like we I
[1:44:37] listed off four miracles in capernum and
[1:44:39] that place was done away with because of
[1:44:41] that I'm going through the supernatural
[1:44:43] book writing everything down the the
[1:44:45] amount of things that happen in America
[1:44:46] is just 100 times more than capernum
[1:44:49] that's why it's going like it is it's
[1:44:51] the the the nation itself is cursed now
[1:44:53] and you can see that it's becoming a
[1:44:55] laughing stock of the world is cursed uh
[1:44:58] but but Al as a city is cursed when
[1:45:01] brother Brandon was there he said you're
[1:45:02] going to be cursed like
[1:45:03] capernum so I wouldn't recommend going
[1:45:06] living there because it's a cursed City
[1:45:08] and a physical location is cursed okay
[1:45:11] just out of Interest I think Levin is
[1:45:16] blessed I don't know that for a fact but
[1:45:18] and I know we I say it as a joke but I
[1:45:20] actually have noticed something I think
[1:45:22] there something different about this
[1:45:23] place there's for some reason there's
[1:45:25] something on it I don't feel any
[1:45:26] negative things I feel a positive thing
[1:45:28] there are some places in this country I
[1:45:29] think I'll never live there it feels
[1:45:31] like it's cursed on the hawk Bay
[1:45:32] something about that place is maybe I
[1:45:34] could go there and break it but I'm not
[1:45:36] really into that I'll just go where
[1:45:37] there's no curse you know now I don't
[1:45:38] know you decide that yourself but where
[1:45:40] you live matters just check that you
[1:45:42] know you should have a piece I
[1:45:44] everything's all right where I live okay
[1:45:46] I'm almost done
[1:45:47] here now let me just talk about the
[1:45:51] power of our words we talked about the
[1:45:52] witch doctors why I said the only Power
[1:45:53] they have sometimes is what they say CU
[1:45:55] they are like Gods too you know we're
[1:45:56] created like Gods so we still do have
[1:45:58] power with our words and James said but
[1:46:00] the tongue can no man tame it is an
[1:46:02] unruly evil full of deadly poison
[1:46:03] therewith bless we God even the father
[1:46:05] and therewith curse We Men which are
[1:46:07] made out to the similitude of God out of
[1:46:09] the same mouth proceed blessings and
[1:46:11] cursings my brethren these things ought
[1:46:13] not so to be okay so be very careful
[1:46:15] with what you do with your mouth that
[1:46:16] you bless you don't curse because it's
[1:46:19] very powerful this is a this is a uh a
[1:46:23] Japanese uh I think it was a scientist
[1:46:26] he did this experiment and then people
[1:46:27] do it you can do it yourself you just
[1:46:29] cook rice and you put it in jars and you
[1:46:31] speak loving nice words to one and you
[1:46:34] speak hate to the other one and
[1:46:35] eventually this is what happens to it
[1:46:37] the the one the hate jar and all the
[1:46:39] experiments I've seen the jar with the
[1:46:41] rice of hate over maybe four five six
[1:46:43] seven eight weeks couple of months it
[1:46:45] always goes rancid and the one that
[1:46:47] you're speaking love to stays good it
[1:46:50] gets a little bit but you know it's it's
[1:46:52] it's noticeably different that's because
[1:46:55] and people don't know why and and people
[1:46:57] scientists say know that's rubbish
[1:46:58] there's nothing in that we know there's
[1:47:00] something in that because we know our
[1:47:01] words have power to create we're like
[1:47:03] creators we can create an atmosphere
[1:47:05] around that Rice we create atmospheres
[1:47:08] we say I love you you're you're you're
[1:47:10] the most amazing rice ever I just really
[1:47:12] love you the other and that Rice will
[1:47:15] take on our words there's water in there
[1:47:17] that just the water water actually obser
[1:47:20] water takes in feelings and things water
[1:47:24] and our bodies are mainly water they
[1:47:26] take in things so the water in that rice
[1:47:28] is probably taking it in man I'm good
[1:47:30] I'm a good
[1:47:31] rice I'm such a I'm a loved rice I'm not
[1:47:35] even being
[1:47:37] eaten but the other one was it was like
[1:47:40] man no one loves me hates me and it just
[1:47:41] this infestation starts to grow in the
[1:47:44] rice I think it's to do with the water I
[1:47:47] I think that's what it is cuz water does
[1:47:49] they have that's something they have
[1:47:50] learned that water takes on this
[1:47:52] atmosphere around it and they can see
[1:47:54] the the I forget the experiment but they
[1:47:56] they looked at it and they played
[1:47:58] different music like a nice music to
[1:47:59] water and the the shape of the water
[1:48:01] changed and they they played evil stuff
[1:48:03] to it and the shape of the water went
[1:48:04] all deformed the the makeup of it so and
[1:48:08] that's what happens to us could I just
[1:48:10] read you a few quotes from Brother
[1:48:11] Brenham here this this may seem negative
[1:48:14] but I just want to show you that this
[1:48:15] these are just some of the things I had
[1:48:16] so many of these to give but I just and
[1:48:18] I had some POS more positive ones but I
[1:48:19] just want to read a few of these then we
[1:48:21] we're almost just inclosing here
[1:48:24] he's talking about someone that's trying
[1:48:25] to affect like a wit doctor like a evil
[1:48:29] person trying to affect him at his
[1:48:30] meeting he said that's right see them
[1:48:31] going in standing trying to hypnotize me
[1:48:34] this is what he was in a meeting and
[1:48:35] went over there he was going to make me
[1:48:36] bark like a dog and standing out there
[1:48:38] trying to do something like that I felt
[1:48:39] that strange Spirit while the anointing
[1:48:41] was on I looked and I said you child of
[1:48:43] the devil why do you do that I said
[1:48:44] cursed be you you'll not move from your
[1:48:46] seat in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:48:47] glory of God and then that man was
[1:48:49] paralyzed sitting there in the seat and
[1:48:51] they packed him out he was trying to you
[1:48:53] know that the spirit of God would have
[1:48:54] come on and said and and so that man was
[1:48:57] cursed now he may be
[1:48:59] saved he might find it hard to accept
[1:49:01] but he may be saved we just cursed in
[1:49:03] that situation but probably if he's
[1:49:05] despising the Holy Ghost like that but
[1:49:07] I'm saying if he didn't do that then he
[1:49:11] he can still go back to the hospital and
[1:49:13] be paralyzed say Lord forgive me I'm
[1:49:14] sorry and you know right here's another
[1:49:19] one this is a man that that tried to
[1:49:23] prove that brother Brandon was at was
[1:49:24] doing trickery and and he was just
[1:49:25] reading the prayer card so he wrote a
[1:49:26] whole lot of wrong things on his prayer
[1:49:28] card and went up in the prayer line to
[1:49:29] say oh look he's he just reads the cards
[1:49:31] and he'll read me these things out but I
[1:49:33] don't actually have them and then he'll
[1:49:34] say you've got this and that and that so
[1:49:36] he went and S and that man raised up and
[1:49:38] and brother BR I'm sorry there to before
[1:49:40] this quote and he he pointed out what
[1:49:43] had happened he said last night you you
[1:49:45] came in and you wrote these things out
[1:49:47] and and you were going to come in and
[1:49:48] try and trick me and do that that's what
[1:49:50] you've done and then so brother then
[1:49:53] brought it out to light he said and that
[1:49:54] man raised up and saying Rend Bram
[1:49:55] that's the truth I was with him last
[1:49:56] night and that's the truth and the man
[1:49:58] on the ppit sorry you grabbed the grab
[1:50:00] me by my pants s and he said I'm sorry
[1:50:02] and I said what you put on your prayer
[1:50:04] card you now have and I and he said oh
[1:50:08] pray pray for me that you know that it
[1:50:09] doesn't happen he was a preacher and
[1:50:12] brother Bram said I have nothing to do
[1:50:13] with that you cursed yourself so you
[1:50:15] have what you put on the prayer card and
[1:50:17] screaming he run from the building he
[1:50:19] said that was it I didn't know what
[1:50:20] happened to him from there but he said
[1:50:21] whatever you put on your card you've got
[1:50:24] um there was on on a blessing one there
[1:50:28] was another man that came to the ppit
[1:50:29] and brother brand said to him he was an
[1:50:31] old man he said he said hang on brother
[1:50:33] he said I see a you've had a hard life
[1:50:35] this there's I see a long hard Road
[1:50:37] between you and I there's something
[1:50:37] you've had a very hard Road and he said
[1:50:39] you've even had to do a lot of things
[1:50:40] just to sneak in and get here and he
[1:50:42] studied his life a bit and he said he
[1:50:44] said you got all these diseases and
[1:50:45] things and and he said but you kind of
[1:50:47] in your heart you love the Lord but
[1:50:48] you've just had a hard Road and he said
[1:50:50] then he said I see a track he said I can
[1:50:52] I can see a a a track he said oh you
[1:50:53] you've written some sort of track that
[1:50:55] um he said you've cursed God that's what
[1:50:57] it is you've written a track and this
[1:50:59] this man had written a track and he said
[1:51:01] is there a god I curse him and he handed
[1:51:03] the track out and he said he said you
[1:51:05] paid a dare price for that brother you
[1:51:06] you paid you you paid for doing that he
[1:51:09] said you've had a lot of trouble on your
[1:51:10] home and he said but God's here today to
[1:51:12] break that off your life here come here
[1:51:13] brother I know you I know you love the
[1:51:15] Lord and I'm going to bless you and he
[1:51:16] he just prayed a simple prayer for he
[1:51:18] said it's all over brother God bless you
[1:51:19] you're blessed you're
[1:51:21] blessed like that that's what God can do
[1:51:24] just doesn't it doesn't Linger on no
[1:51:25] that's it you're blessed you can be
[1:51:27] blessed you want it receive it and he
[1:51:29] walked out blessed handed tracks out
[1:51:31] cursing God and he actually had the
[1:51:32] track in his pocket he said here this is
[1:51:34] the track here maybe he was going to
[1:51:36] confess
[1:51:37] it okay this one here was quite powerful
[1:51:40] brother Bron was trying to pray pray for
[1:51:41] a person and I think people were just
[1:51:43] being so noisy and I think I think when
[1:51:44] the spirit of God came if it was he said
[1:51:47] bodies are like spirits and if they move
[1:51:49] the spirit's moving it distracts him
[1:51:51] from seeing the vision and he would
[1:51:52] that's why says don't move keep your
[1:51:53] eyes closed just more so so that this
[1:51:55] person can receive what they want so no
[1:51:57] one gets distracted I don't get
[1:51:59] distracted I can help this person and I
[1:52:01] think people kept on moving and this and
[1:52:02] that and he kept on saying look don't do
[1:52:03] that can you just stop moving and then
[1:52:06] something came on and me his voice
[1:52:07] changed and he said how do you do lady
[1:52:09] and this is while this has been
[1:52:11] happening he said Do you believe you
[1:52:12] believe me to be a servant if God will
[1:52:13] reveal to me what your trouble is will
[1:52:15] you accept it then he stops and he must
[1:52:17] talk to someone else he says I can't
[1:52:18] help it sir see the vision just leaves
[1:52:20] me cuz people are just moving around he
[1:52:21] said then as voice changed he said in
[1:52:23] the name of Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:52:24] may you sit still cursed be you if you
[1:52:27] move from now on until you're called for
[1:52:29] the sake of these things I say it and if
[1:52:31] I be God's Prophet you better be careful
[1:52:32] what you're doing he just said you'll be
[1:52:34] cursed if you move anymore cuz because
[1:52:36] he couldn't get the vision to help this
[1:52:38] lady I thought that was quite
[1:52:42] powerful um one more somebody else said
[1:52:44] brother Brown might been to church but
[1:52:46] never did I see the Bible made real like
[1:52:48] that he said there's got there's got to
[1:52:49] be something you know there's something
[1:52:51] about that he said now depends on what
[1:52:53] you think it is when you begin to see
[1:52:54] the revealed word of God if you want to
[1:52:56] say it's beab go ahead that's between
[1:52:57] you and God if you believe it's Jesus
[1:52:59] Christ then God will reward you for it
[1:53:01] but that's the only way you'll ever
[1:53:02] you'll either be cursed by it or you'll
[1:53:04] be blessed by it either one which one
[1:53:06] you want to it's up to you so if we
[1:53:08] receive it as from the Lord we'll be
[1:53:09] blessed this revealed word Lord thank
[1:53:10] you we'll just be so blessed you know
[1:53:13] but if you want to say n there b like
[1:53:14] this we'll listen
[1:53:16] that this one here is just about saying
[1:53:18] if you baptized any other way you'll be
[1:53:20] or if anyone speaks any other goel than
[1:53:22] what I've spoken to him let him be a
[1:53:24] cursed so there's many cursed preachers
[1:53:26] that are preaching a gospel that is not
[1:53:27] the word of God like even to go out and
[1:53:29] preach um baptism in the titles and I
[1:53:32] baptize that that the people that do
[1:53:33] that are cursed because Paul said if
[1:53:36] they preach any other gospel than what
[1:53:37] I've spoken you let them be a cursed so
[1:53:40] as a result of speaking those things
[1:53:41] they're cursed right but the Bible says
[1:53:44] blessed is he that readeth or or he that
[1:53:47] Hearth and curs is he that'll add one
[1:53:49] thing or take one thing away from it
[1:53:50] there you are so you see the danger part
[1:53:52] don't add anything to it don't take it
[1:53:54] away just leave it just the way it is
[1:53:55] and you'll be blessed stay inside the
[1:53:57] word of God and you'll be blessed
[1:53:59] anything outside of that is
[1:54:01] cursed okay that that's as simple as
[1:54:03] what this whole thing is you don't need
[1:54:04] to be scared about it just saying okay
[1:54:05] Lord show me your word I I want to just
[1:54:07] live in your word and and the Lord will
[1:54:09] bless you no matter what it comes out at
[1:54:11] that's why Hannah you know she said Lord
[1:54:14] I I I just love you I just want to have
[1:54:16] an offspring for you and she got given
[1:54:17] Samuel and this and Michael I don't know
[1:54:19] why I put this in there but just a
[1:54:20] contrast she laughed at David and look
[1:54:23] at them and she could never have
[1:54:24] children they they one got Offspring one
[1:54:27] didn't just and based on what they did
[1:54:30] here that's why I say this stay with the
[1:54:33] word of God and you'll be blessed in
[1:54:34] this world and the next it's it but it's
[1:54:37] very easy it's not like oh if I do one
[1:54:39] little thing but then every little thing
[1:54:41] does matter as
[1:54:42] well okay CU I don't want to say oh you
[1:54:44] can just do little things that doesn't
[1:54:45] matter no it all matters but just be
[1:54:47] diligent just just stay with the word of
[1:54:50] God God will correct you if you're wrong
[1:54:52] yeah go with it if you know you're wrong
[1:54:54] just take it yep I was wrong didn't
[1:54:56] realize I did that but the Lord showed
[1:54:57] me I was wrong I take it cuz he doesn't
[1:55:00] want you to keep doing it he says look I
[1:55:01] want to bless you I want to correct you
[1:55:03] so you get blessed that's why I correct
[1:55:05] you then you live in that new way and
[1:55:07] you get blessed okay can you give me
[1:55:11] five minutes to just can I just talk
[1:55:12] about this for five minutes to my
[1:55:14] brother Joel because he committed
[1:55:17] suicide a week and a half ago and and
[1:55:20] and now I have to apply this
[1:55:24] this sermon this thought has got to work
[1:55:26] I I have to apply it to to my own life
[1:55:29] you know it's it's it's got to have
[1:55:30] substance to it you know it like cuz
[1:55:33] this affects this you know like the
[1:55:35] concepts of this affect him because many
[1:55:38] people say well if you commit suicide
[1:55:39] you're you're done you're gone you
[1:55:41] know but according to what I just looked
[1:55:44] at it's not the
[1:55:47] case right that's not the case that he
[1:55:50] didn't commit the unforgivable sin
[1:55:53] right
[1:55:55] and but I'll say this my brother Joel he
[1:55:59] he he and I had the experience with the
[1:56:00] Lord when we were 14 15 where we were
[1:56:03] healed instantly of the we were on drugs
[1:56:06] and I never liked it he always got into
[1:56:08] it I never did I was following along
[1:56:09] with him and we were healed instantly
[1:56:11] from being higher on drugs and we went
[1:56:13] like that the spirit of God came in
[1:56:15] after we prayed he experienced that with
[1:56:17] me and and of all the people in the
[1:56:19] family we got 10 brothers and sisters
[1:56:21] it's been my self that's really gone on
[1:56:23] with the Lord and and Joel has always
[1:56:25] loved the Lord now he's lived the most
[1:56:28] failure curse Rd life you'd ever see but
[1:56:31] he was the only one that always loved
[1:56:32] the Lord in his heart he always did he
[1:56:35] always was concerned about the Lord and
[1:56:37] every time he was living in sin he would
[1:56:38] hate it he would always be disappointed
[1:56:40] in his heart now but but I'll be honest
[1:56:44] with you and say like I saw in Joel uh
[1:56:46] he my father said look he always loved
[1:56:49] the Lord because anytime you talk to him
[1:56:51] for a while the conversation would
[1:56:52] always end up to be about the Lord he
[1:56:54] said because that was the most important
[1:56:56] thing in his life but if you looked at
[1:56:57] his life that he lived here you it was
[1:57:00] hard to reconcile the two together
[1:57:02] because he lived such a cursed life he
[1:57:04] just had such a hard
[1:57:06] time uh doing right now why I say that
[1:57:12] is because with Joel if he was going to
[1:57:14] serve the Lord he had to be 100% or
[1:57:17] nothing it was 100% And if he ever
[1:57:21] slipped up at all he was so disappointed
[1:57:22] with himself and then the devil would PL
[1:57:24] him and say oh look at you you're a
[1:57:26] failure you can't do it and then he
[1:57:27] would slip back to his old ways oh well
[1:57:29] M just go up and then he would drink and
[1:57:32] sleep with woman do all sorts of stuff
[1:57:34] and then his life would be cursed like
[1:57:35] he wouldn't believe and then he'd get so
[1:57:38] sick of that he'd say I just can't live
[1:57:40] like this Lord forgive me I want to
[1:57:42] serve you Lord you know my heart I want
[1:57:43] to and he would come
[1:57:45] back and then the minute he would come
[1:57:48] back the Lord was right there to go and
[1:57:51] put it all back together
[1:57:52] as much as what he could cuz you know if
[1:57:54] he had done things he he'd put it all
[1:57:55] back together as much as what he could
[1:57:56] all right here you go and he would do
[1:57:59] the cycle again and he and then he would
[1:58:00] go on he'd be on a mountain top and try
[1:58:02] but but when he couldn't attain to
[1:58:03] Perfection which was what he always
[1:58:04] wanted I just want to live exactly right
[1:58:08] now then he would do it again now we're
[1:58:11] not talking like we backslide you know
[1:58:12] my we you might say well I last week um
[1:58:16] I don't want to make light of it but I I
[1:58:18] watch something on YouTube that I
[1:58:19] shouldn't watch I watch someone punching
[1:58:20] someone else or something like let's say
[1:58:22] you know and you felt convicted about
[1:58:25] that I'm not saying there's differences
[1:58:28] in s but Joel's thing wasn't oh I
[1:58:29] watched something on YouTube it was like
[1:58:31] I'm sleeping with all sorts of women
[1:58:32] going out there all sorts of just
[1:58:34] horrendous things you know but I believe
[1:58:37] the sin question was settled in his
[1:58:41] heart and and he was in his life that I
[1:58:46] knew him like I mean I knew my whole
[1:58:47] life but in his Christian walk it was if
[1:58:49] you look back over his 25 years he was
[1:58:52] in and out about 20 30 times but every
[1:58:56] time he came back to the Lord the Lord
[1:58:57] would
[1:58:58] always try and would always pick up the
[1:59:01] pieces for him I feel like I've lost the
[1:59:04] train of
[1:59:06] thought but that's what I was going to
[1:59:08] say and we would always try and tell
[1:59:09] John no doubt brother be probably did
[1:59:11] too look if you failed don't worry about
[1:59:13] it don't worry just forgive let the Lord
[1:59:17] forgive you and just move on don't just
[1:59:19] give up
[1:59:19] everything don't don't you know that was
[1:59:22] it was always the same he said everyone
[1:59:24] would tell him don't worry don't take it
[1:59:25] so just just yet walk on but he felt
[1:59:28] like no I can't do that cuz that shows I
[1:59:29] don't care that I failed I just want to
[1:59:32] be perfect and that's what the Lord
[1:59:33] deserves of me but he could never attain
[1:59:35] to the the bar that he set for
[1:59:38] himself and and he's a unique case
[1:59:40] because he also did a lot of drugs and
[1:59:42] everything so you know he's having
[1:59:43] trouble comprehending everything and
[1:59:44] it's and the more drugs than that that
[1:59:45] he did as he went on the more harder it
[1:59:47] became but you even witnessed it that's
[1:59:50] why it didn't surprise me when he when
[1:59:51] he found out when he was going to live
[1:59:52] at the factory it didn't surprise me
[1:59:54] that everything just went back to back
[1:59:57] like the Lord lined it up so he could be
[1:59:58] there and everything fell into place for
[2:00:00] him it didn't surprise me at all because
[2:00:02] that's the way Joel I'd always seen it
[2:00:03] because he had such a pure heart every
[2:00:06] time he did Sin he hated it he never
[2:00:09] sinned and was like how I'm happy doing
[2:00:11] this it was like if he peeled back the
[2:00:12] layer in his heart he thought Lord I
[2:00:14] just hate living like this I want to be
[2:00:17] perfect and you know he he
[2:00:22] you can just see as his life went on the
[2:00:24] state he ended up having to live him was
[2:00:26] he he couldn't live this where he wanted
[2:00:28] to but then he didn't want to live there
[2:00:31] either and as his life went on it just
[2:00:33] got you know I thought man this man this
[2:00:35] man is having a terrible existence but
[2:00:37] as but to a degree we need' to go bad
[2:00:40] his life was so cursed just but then we
[2:00:43] need serve God God would put it all back
[2:00:45] together and you know it turns out that
[2:00:48] the opportunity that he had to to come
[2:00:50] here and to do all that was
[2:00:52] I would say it's last opportunity here
[2:00:54] on Earth you know cuz the Lord lined up
[2:00:56] he was going to be living at the factory
[2:00:57] he had a job there the the police said
[2:00:59] he could come here for church everything
[2:01:00] was just lining up but he just at that
[2:01:03] point Satan got him and just turned him
[2:01:05] and I couldn't do anything to get him
[2:01:06] back he just was going that way and then
[2:01:08] now I'm not saying it's last opportunity
[2:01:10] like he's lost I'm
[2:01:11] saying I don't know God and I don't know
[2:01:14] exactly know the ways of God
[2:01:17] but you know anyone you we if any rugby
[2:01:21] people that watch rugby you know when
[2:01:22] Japan used to tour in
[2:01:24] the 1995 you know they're still hopeless
[2:01:28] but back then they were hopeless even
[2:01:29] worse you know and the All Blacks would
[2:01:31] play them and you know they' just get a
[2:01:32] total thrashing you know the Japanese
[2:01:34] would put up a good fight but just get
[2:01:36] thrashed you know and I do remember one
[2:01:38] all black Captain Shan
[2:01:40] Fitzpatrick the game had about 10
[2:01:42] minutes to go and we were like 95 nil or
[2:01:44] something you know and when they scored
[2:01:47] the the we scored a try and it was then
[2:01:50] the next try would have got us over 100
[2:01:51] points
[2:01:52] and and the the
[2:01:55] um
[2:01:57] the captain of the All Blacks he just
[2:01:59] said look we call the game off he said
[2:02:01] let's save these guys a humiliation of
[2:02:03] 100 points let call the game off and he
[2:02:04] told the ri game's over now I don't know
[2:02:07] that that that's what happened but but
[2:02:11] but at a certain point with this man it
[2:02:12] was just you know I think in himself he
[2:02:15] was like look it's been 43 years and I
[2:02:17] still can't even get this right look at
[2:02:18] the opportunity I had with Isaac look at
[2:02:20] what i' done and I still missed one
[2:02:22] up that's Satan telling him you know
[2:02:25] does that make sense you put yourself in
[2:02:27] that but I knew Joel and a when he was
[2:02:29] there and Bruce going ATT test that when
[2:02:30] he when he first came and you put him in
[2:02:32] prison what's the first thing he
[2:02:35] does start serving God cuz all those
[2:02:37] things are push back for a moment if you
[2:02:39] see I always thought if you took all the
[2:02:41] sin everything away from the world Joel
[2:02:43] would just be loving the Lord like but
[2:02:46] all this other stuff when it came and he
[2:02:47] didn't have enough power to resist it
[2:02:48] he'd go here and there and as many
[2:02:50] people has tried over the years it just
[2:02:52] he just continually was like that but in
[2:02:54] his heart he loved the Lord he really
[2:02:56] did and when he first turned up there
[2:02:58] man it was like it was like I was having
[2:03:00] Jesus in that side room CU there was
[2:03:02] such an anointing on him like you talk
[2:03:05] to him and he he was in such a place cuz
[2:03:07] that he just wanted it was all or
[2:03:08] nothing and it always Marvels you know
[2:03:10] when I you said Lord what shall I do now
[2:03:12] I'm here Lord living in this little room
[2:03:14] at the factory there what should I do
[2:03:16] Lord what should I do when I'm here
[2:03:17] thinking he's going to do some great
[2:03:18] thing the Lord said to him paint cuz I
[2:03:21] need to painting
[2:03:23] done he said that's what the Lord told
[2:03:25] me to paint
[2:03:27] so but you can
[2:03:31] imagine if I could
[2:03:33] bring if I could bring this
[2:03:38] like you know even in this situation
[2:03:41] we're more than
[2:03:43] conquerors
[2:03:44] like I saw I witnessed on that day when
[2:03:50] when we took his body out of the the
[2:03:51] bush I just I I and we experienced God
[2:03:55] doing something it was so unique you'd
[2:03:58] think well that's a pretty um uh
[2:04:01] shameful situation there's a man hanging
[2:04:03] up there in the bush by a rope dead and
[2:04:05] you're dragging him out and you're
[2:04:06] thinking that's God you're thinking
[2:04:08] God's doing something great but you
[2:04:12] see we've got to know we when you know
[2:04:15] God you can see even in that he still
[2:04:17] doesn't let Satan win even in that you
[2:04:21] know like
[2:04:22] like if I could just recount the day a
[2:04:24] little bit we the day before he hadd
[2:04:26] been gone for a week no one had heard
[2:04:27] from him we didn't know where he was and
[2:04:28] then the the day before that they' found
[2:04:31] his car smashed um up in the bush so so
[2:04:35] up to that point no one knew where he
[2:04:36] was cuz his phone was off and then the
[2:04:38] Poli because my sister ailed a missing
[2:04:40] person's report then when they found the
[2:04:42] car they said Oh okay that's linked to
[2:04:44] Joel and they told her we found his car
[2:04:46] up there in the bush that had been about
[2:04:47] a week from when we hadn't seen him to
[2:04:49] when he found we found his car that was
[2:04:51] a Tuesday night and my brother I got a
[2:04:56] brother in gizor a couple of Brothers in
[2:04:57] Gisborne something came over him he just
[2:04:58] got back from a weekl long camping trip
[2:05:00] around w c Moana and he got back there
[2:05:02] and something came over him he said I'm
[2:05:03] want to go there and find him so he said
[2:05:06] I'm leaving first thing in the morning
[2:05:07] we didn't know you know it was just an
[2:05:09] assuming maybe Something's Happened to
[2:05:10] him we don't know but so so he hopped in
[2:05:13] the car the next morning and drove my
[2:05:15] other sister from down south was already
[2:05:17] coming up here for a family event so she
[2:05:19] was already in Wellington and and then
[2:05:23] now admittedly me being me I thought man
[2:05:25] I I I'm going to be honest I thought you
[2:05:27] know I I do want to find him but Joel's
[2:05:28] done this before he goes on Benders and
[2:05:30] he he he pops up after a couple of days
[2:05:32] you know so I'm like he could be on a
[2:05:33] bender you know I'm not the sort of guy
[2:05:36] that gets too worked up over it not not
[2:05:38] worked up but caught up in the drama of
[2:05:40] it and if I was honest I thought but I
[2:05:43] can't really I live an hour away you
[2:05:45] know these guys are driving 8 hours nine
[2:05:47] hours I can't be the guy that didn't
[2:05:48] even bother going lives an hour away
[2:05:50] okay that was that was my motivating
[2:05:52] factor if I was honest because I thought
[2:05:54] he'd probably show up somewhere but then
[2:05:56] I thought there's a high chance he could
[2:05:57] be dead I'm not sure but I love my
[2:05:59] brother I don't want to S like I don't
[2:06:00] love him but it was
[2:06:01] just and then so I turned up at 1:30
[2:06:04] before they did they
[2:06:07] turn no one knew if there was a search
[2:06:09] party happening or nothing was happening
[2:06:10] no one knew anything it was just the
[2:06:11] random things and N was going to turn up
[2:06:13] and then my brothers and so we tune up
[2:06:16] at 1:30 we have a bit of a look around
[2:06:18] but on the hour every hour people
[2:06:20] started tuning up that were un booked
[2:06:22] unplanned we turn up there for an hour
[2:06:24] we look have a bit of a walk around we
[2:06:25] couldn't find anything an hour later the
[2:06:27] police turn up no one knew they were
[2:06:28] coming they didn't know they were coming
[2:06:31] I just said oh it's just worked out that
[2:06:32] this way so they turned up at at 2:30
[2:06:34] they said oh well yeah we just thought
[2:06:36] we'd come have a look and see what's
[2:06:38] going
[2:06:38] on and just you know cuz they'd found
[2:06:41] the van the day before so they tune up
[2:06:42] so we've been there for an hour they
[2:06:43] tune up and then and then they said oh
[2:06:47] and and and it just happens that um the
[2:06:50] there's a lady that does the voluntary
[2:06:52] search and rescue no the yeah and and
[2:06:56] she's actually a GP but she heard about
[2:06:58] this and she said look I'm going to go
[2:07:00] there today and look I'm going to get my
[2:07:02] dog and I'm going to turn up there today
[2:07:03] and look she said I'll be there at 3:30
[2:07:06] she had all these appointments on but
[2:07:07] she said I've got a free day tomorrow so
[2:07:09] I'm just going to push all my
[2:07:10] appointments out to tomorrow go back
[2:07:11] home get my dog and come there I'll be
[2:07:13] there at 3:30 so we arrive 1:30 the
[2:07:15] police 2:30 she arrived 3:30 it was just
[2:07:20] no one planned anything it was just 1 2
[2:07:23] 3 and then they went into the bush and
[2:07:27] by 4:30 they were back out saying you
[2:07:28] know we've got sad news we we found him
[2:07:30] up in the bush there and and he was dead
[2:07:35] and
[2:07:38] something when I was driving down there
[2:07:40] from
[2:07:42] um the up in Levin I'll say the first
[2:07:46] natural but first I was thinking about
[2:07:48] death and I thought you know it's if he
[2:07:49] was dead I thought that's such a sad
[2:07:51] thing that a man dies alone you know no
[2:07:52] one buys beds so I thought it's such a
[2:07:55] you know it's a good thing with a man
[2:07:56] when he or woman when they die they got
[2:07:57] someone beside them that loved them that
[2:07:59] you know I love you and then they they
[2:08:01] go where where they go I don't know but
[2:08:04] still it's they should have people
[2:08:06] people beside them that love them so I
[2:08:08] had this thing on my heart I thought
[2:08:10] that's such a sad thing if he's up there
[2:08:11] and and there's no one beside him that
[2:08:13] loves him tells him that they loved him
[2:08:14] you know that he took his last breath in
[2:08:16] that situation I thought that's such a
[2:08:17] sad thing and and and
[2:08:22] and something was on come over me and I
[2:08:25] thought if they find him I want to go
[2:08:26] and see him and I want to go right
[2:08:28] beside him and tell him I love him if
[2:08:30] they find him cuz I thought that man's
[2:08:31] not going to die alone not going to die
[2:08:33] there alone in the bush and and when the
[2:08:36] lady said that they found him I said
[2:08:37] well can I go and see him they said uh
[2:08:39] no look it's like she said look it's a
[2:08:41] it's a crime scene now technically cuz
[2:08:43] he may have been murdered it's a crime
[2:08:44] scene we don't you know it's caught and
[2:08:46] off and you can't really go there and
[2:08:48] two you don't want to see that you know
[2:08:49] you're better better off to remember him
[2:08:51] the way it was I said look I want to see
[2:08:53] him I said no no no you can't maybe when
[2:08:54] the other Constable comes you
[2:08:57] can and but in my heart I thought I'm
[2:09:00] this day is not going to expire until
[2:09:01] I've been there before they take him
[2:09:03] down it just something was sitting there
[2:09:06] I I see the day had people had to play
[2:09:08] out things during the day you know and
[2:09:12] so it turned out that my brothers they
[2:09:14] we decided that they were all going to
[2:09:15] call different members of the family one
[2:09:16] was going to go and call my father one
[2:09:18] my mother one my sisters and that and
[2:09:20] just enclosing
[2:09:22] and they they all um then everyone had a
[2:09:27] phone call to make apart from me and I
[2:09:30] had to move my vehicle to move it down
[2:09:31] the road a bit so they could drive out
[2:09:33] cuz there was no reception we were was
[2:09:34] there to drive away and make a phone
[2:09:35] call but they so they drove
[2:09:38] away and I drove my vehicle down and all
[2:09:41] my family were gone cuz they didn't
[2:09:43] really want to sit my brothers that had
[2:09:44] a bit of a curse in his life too for a
[2:09:46] while they had his partner committed
[2:09:47] suicide he hadd seen someone on the Rope
[2:09:48] he said I don't want to see that again
[2:09:50] and my sister's that J said I I don't
[2:09:52] want to see that I'll never go in the
[2:09:53] bush again things like that you know
[2:09:55] they but there's something in me said
[2:09:56] I've got to someone's got to be there
[2:09:57] for
[2:09:58] him they all left and I walked back up
[2:10:00] the road to where the group of cars were
[2:10:03] and there was the new cable arrived and
[2:10:05] there were four four a group of four or
[2:10:06] five of them coming down and we met at
[2:10:08] the intersection where you go to the
[2:10:10] bush like where where you walk into the
[2:10:12] bush there and they were all going in
[2:10:14] there and I I I I just I saw the
[2:10:16] situation unfold as I was walking I
[2:10:17] thought this is because I'm supposed to
[2:10:18] go in there cuz they were walking down I
[2:10:20] met them right at the junction point and
[2:10:22] all my brothers and everyone was gone
[2:10:24] and I said look you've got to let me go
[2:10:26] you've got to let me in there that I
[2:10:28] just I was I had tears I said that man's
[2:10:29] not going to die alone in there it's not
[2:10:30] not going to happen and she she tried to
[2:10:32] talk and I just I talked again and she
[2:10:34] said Okay Y come in and it was it was
[2:10:38] the most outstanding experience from
[2:10:40] from from the moment I from when they
[2:10:42] said you should go on the moment I
[2:10:43] started
[2:10:44] walking I just felt such a powerful love
[2:10:48] come over my heart and you begin to
[2:10:50] understand the love of God
[2:10:52] that I knew that in there was my brother
[2:10:53] hanging on a rope in the bush in the
[2:10:55] disgraceful sight you know but yet love
[2:10:58] says I don't care where he is I don't
[2:11:00] care what he's done I'm going to go
[2:11:01] there and tell him that I love
[2:11:03] him I don't care what I see I don't care
[2:11:05] what he's done he's going to be loved in
[2:11:08] there in that state too and I thought
[2:11:10] about the love of God as I was walking
[2:11:12] that the redeeming love of God came down
[2:11:14] the same way to each one of us I don't
[2:11:15] care what they've done I don't care
[2:11:16] where they are I'm going to go and I'm
[2:11:18] going to get them out of whatever
[2:11:20] situation that it is I'm going to get
[2:11:22] them I'm to go and see them and wherever
[2:11:24] they are the the the the power that the
[2:11:26] the feeling that came on just as I was
[2:11:28] walking there you know and then I then I
[2:11:31] walked there in the in the through the
[2:11:33] bush and they said he's up over there
[2:11:35] and I could see his body swinging
[2:11:36] through the trees and I just I think can
[2:11:39] I go closer they say you can go right up
[2:11:40] there and I went up there and I stood
[2:11:43] there you know and I I saw that was my
[2:11:44] brother you know I saw this sounds funny
[2:11:47] but he's always had this arched back you
[2:11:48] know sounds more but he's in the tree
[2:11:50] and I saw was Arch back cuz he had a
[2:11:52] thing don't worry and I thought that's
[2:11:55] Joel there Joel Lee cuz I saw his arch
[2:11:58] back and I said I love you bro amen just
[2:12:01] want to say I love you you know like on
[2:12:04] behalf of the family or somebody was
[2:12:06] there somebody was there and
[2:12:09] and
[2:12:11] and
[2:12:13] then you know I said many tears because
[2:12:16] it is it's also him my brother you know
[2:12:18] but I said I love you man and and but in
[2:12:21] that spot someone was
[2:12:23] there and and when I had my time I said
[2:12:26] yeah thanks and I really appreciate it
[2:12:27] to the police I said look thank you so
[2:12:29] much for make for they thought it was
[2:12:31] probably going to go another way this
[2:12:32] guy's going to break down it's going to
[2:12:33] be but I said look thank you so much for
[2:12:34] letting me do that I really appreciate
[2:12:36] that just I was so thankful like you you
[2:12:38] don't know what that meant to me to say
[2:12:39] that that man didn't die alone and so I
[2:12:42] walked out we walked out and then then
[2:12:44] they had all the um stretches and that
[2:12:45] coming and they maybe an hour later he
[2:12:47] was out out of the Bush and it was like
[2:12:49] a it was like a
[2:12:51] you know when a fallen soldier comes in
[2:12:53] from overseas on a plane and then they
[2:12:54] have the the casket comes out of the
[2:12:56] plane and it sort of comes out like an
[2:12:59] honor the day felt like that it was like
[2:13:02] God saying I'm going to go there's going
[2:13:04] to be a procession a parade I'm going to
[2:13:06] go in there and get my sun out of the
[2:13:07] Bush and bring them out like this that's
[2:13:10] what it felt like like when we when we
[2:13:12] looked at this here they they here this
[2:13:13] here like these men I if you can see
[2:13:15] they they've got them on they're walking
[2:13:16] them out of the Bush and it's a somus
[2:13:18] site and they they're walking them up
[2:13:19] and they they bring them around and
[2:13:20] there's about five or six of them and
[2:13:21] they they put him up onto the the Hearst
[2:13:24] and we're around there
[2:13:25] and and the thing that spoke to me in
[2:13:27] the end was they put him in a white HST
[2:13:30] is a HST is it usually they're black
[2:13:33] they're always black right and I knew
[2:13:35] when I watched them drive away and that
[2:13:37] white one I knew that was from the Lord
[2:13:40] like the Lord's saying no no don't worry
[2:13:41] it's all right yeah he loved the cursed
[2:13:43] life when he was here yeah yeah he
[2:13:46] did but that didn't change what that
[2:13:49] didn't change the curse in his soul was
[2:13:50] not not
[2:13:52] there that wasn't there but but yeah the
[2:13:54] things he did caus this and then in the
[2:13:56] end I think the Lord said okay well to
[2:13:57] that devil CU he said to Job the devil
[2:14:00] came to to the Lord and said uh look at
[2:14:03] job I'm going to affect him he said okay
[2:14:05] you can affect him uh you can take all
[2:14:06] the stuff don't take his don't don't
[2:14:08] hurt him he did that then then he came
[2:14:10] back and wanted to do some more damage
[2:14:11] he said okay you can hurt him but don't
[2:14:13] take his life if Satan came back the
[2:14:15] third time and said can I take his life
[2:14:17] if God said yes then he could have taken
[2:14:18] his life how is it any different in this
[2:14:20] situ
[2:14:22] you know okay all right Joel that's cuz
[2:14:24] he was having so much taught
[2:14:27] hardship I want to say two more things
[2:14:29] about it when I was talking with my dad
[2:14:30] about it we were talking about it this
[2:14:32] is the day after and you know we were
[2:14:33] talking about how he just wanted
[2:14:34] Perfection and something came over me
[2:14:36] and thought came in like a like such a
[2:14:39] revelation and the Lord said as we were
[2:14:41] talking the Lord said to me he's got
[2:14:42] Perfection that he always wanted now
[2:14:44] amen I thought wow that's so powerful
[2:14:48] the one thing he always wanted which you
[2:14:50] could say caused all the trouble in his
[2:14:52] life all his trouble was because he just
[2:14:55] wanted Perfection when he couldn't reach
[2:14:56] it he was so disappointed and then the
[2:14:57] devil would mess with him and they try
[2:14:58] and go back and the one thing he wanted
[2:15:01] was to be perfect before the Lord I
[2:15:04] thought man he's got it he's perfect now
[2:15:07] before he's got what he always
[2:15:09] wanted didn't go in a glamorous way but
[2:15:12] the Lord made sure even out of the Bush
[2:15:13] he came and I want to say the last thing
[2:15:16] which the Lord has shown me a few things
[2:15:18] afterwards even why I went there you
[2:15:19] know it's so that this demon doesn't
[2:15:22] think he could have the last say you
[2:15:23] know the Lord wasn't about to let his
[2:15:25] son St out there in the bush and rot
[2:15:28] just fade away and like this demon
[2:15:29] there's no doubt when he was up there
[2:15:31] that demonic spirit of suicide that was
[2:15:33] hanging around like a mangy little
[2:15:34] stinking hyena hanging around its pray
[2:15:37] thinking look what I got you know I'm
[2:15:39] the king of the jungle this little mangy
[2:15:41] little demonic creature that it is
[2:15:43] that's reserved to the pits of Hell
[2:15:46] lurking around there do you know God was
[2:15:49] going to send himself in
[2:15:51] cuz I know who I am I know where I stand
[2:15:55] God sends himself into that ground to
[2:15:57] chase away that little stinking hyena
[2:15:59] stinking demon to say the lion of the
[2:16:02] tribe of Judas king of the jungle even
[2:16:04] in that situation God had the last life
[2:16:07] you get scat you little demon scat
[2:16:11] little pissy hyena and comes the lion of
[2:16:14] the tribe of Judah say right we're
[2:16:16] bringing them out of here even as bodies
[2:16:18] blessed even as bodies anointed
[2:16:22] it's still anointed it's like Elisha he
[2:16:24] he was dead for he died he was in a pit
[2:16:26] his bones were there and the man fell
[2:16:28] into the pit and he came back to life
[2:16:29] cuz he was
[2:16:30] anointed even his bones were anointed
[2:16:33] that man was an anointed Son of God
[2:16:35] that's why he says he's not going to
[2:16:36] leave there not going to be left up
[2:16:38] there on the bush to rot I don't care
[2:16:39] what sort of a life he's lived complete
[2:16:41] failure here and curs to smothering it
[2:16:44] doesn't matter his soul was free from
[2:16:47] the curse it was
[2:16:49] free get him out of the bush
[2:16:51] honorably bring him out
[2:16:54] honorably he's a Son of God it was such
[2:16:57] a powerful experience that's why people
[2:17:00] expect me to be sad I'm like how can I
[2:17:02] be I saw even in the darkest dire
[2:17:05] moments I see God
[2:17:07] moving and go to places where we don't
[2:17:10] want to go we don't want to go there see
[2:17:11] a man swinging on a road but God goes
