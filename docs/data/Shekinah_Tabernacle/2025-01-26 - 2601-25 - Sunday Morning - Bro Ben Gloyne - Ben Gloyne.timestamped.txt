[5:53] praise the Lord good
[5:56] morning how are you doing this morning
[5:59] it's good good I know I always say that
[6:00] but I always want to
[6:02] [Music]
[6:03] know always like seeing you always like
[6:06] coming up here and you know seeing the
[6:08] different Brethren and and some I know
[6:10] quite well some I know not as well as
[6:12] others but you know I do I know all of
[6:14] you and I know the different Pathways
[6:16] you've
[6:17] taken and the different places where the
[6:19] Lord's LED you um in your life and here
[6:23] we are here in this moment here just the
[6:25] Lord's just intertwined all of us um
[6:28] this morning and we're on a
[6:31] journey
[6:33] we and our journey didn't start here it
[6:35] started in the mind of God before this
[6:38] all began and you're on the most amazing
[6:41] Supernatural Journey you've ever been on
[6:43] in your entire
[6:44] life and you're the star of the show I
[6:48] don't care what your life might look
[6:49] like you're the star of the show the
[6:52] whole show has been written about you
[6:54] all the twists and turns that we might
[6:56] take and everything like that you know
[6:57] the Lord the Lord's in the whole thing
[7:00] he's got to be you know and even even
[7:02] when we the things that we don't
[7:04] understand he's still in it all you know
[7:06] he's been to every single place
[7:09] that that every single place that a
[7:12] human being could end up
[7:15] in there's only one place that of all
[7:17] those places where where there's no way
[7:19] back from it you know when we blaspheme
[7:22] the Holy Ghost but apart from that every
[7:24] other place where a human being could
[7:26] possibly find themselves stuck and mired
[7:28] down in somewhere the Lord's been there
[7:31] and he's able to take us from every
[7:33] single place you know we sometimes in
[7:36] life it seems so complicated like like
[7:39] even you think of David and Beth Sheba
[7:42] you know it seemed like such a
[7:44] complicated awful situation and then
[7:46] suddenly it was just it was like a big
[7:48] mess that that that really shouldn't
[7:51] have happened in the first place and
[7:53] then nothing should have become of that
[7:55] but then out of that whole big mess came
[7:57] Solomon
[7:59] you know which is which is one of the
[8:01] greatest kings that that there ever was
[8:03] and out of that mess came Jesus actually
[8:06] and when you think about that you think
[8:07] you know sometimes I think God just puts
[8:09] these things in there to show us it
[8:10] doesn't matter where like our picture I
[8:12] imagine a sheep you know it sort of gets
[8:13] Tangled Up In some mess somewhere but
[8:16] the Lord's able to go anywhere and
[8:17] untangle it and get it out of there and
[8:19] even even in that mess that David
[8:20] created the Lord showed I can even get
[8:22] to there and untangle it all and make
[8:25] something of it and that's the god that
[8:27] we serve this morning so let's let's
[8:29] stand and let's let's just come in
[8:31] adoration to the Lord that you know he's
[8:33] a he's a great Redeemer that that that
[8:35] he's got our life in the palm of his
[8:37] hand and that's all everything's going
[8:39] to be all right amen Lord we just commit
[8:42] the service to your hands this morning

[40:26] Lord we thank you Lord we commit the
[40:28] service into your hands in Jesus
[40:30] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[40:33] friends you can have your seats uh this
[40:35] morning so I want to talk about we have
[40:37] no part in him and that's the devil
[40:39] right we have no there should be
[40:41] something burning in our souls that I
[40:43] want nothing to do with him he has
[40:45] nothing to do with me anymore I want
[40:47] nothing to do with him I mean if we read
[40:50] the same scriptures from the Amplified
[40:53] uh version here I'm just going to read
[40:54] it says I'll not talk much with you more
[40:56] for the Prince which is the Evil Genius
[40:58] ruler of the world is coming and he hath
[41:00] no claim on me he has nothing in common
[41:03] with me there is nothing in me that
[41:05] belongs to him and he has no power over
[41:07] me but Satan is coming and I do that as
[41:10] the father commanded me so that the
[41:12] world may know be convinced that uh I
[41:14] love the father and that I only do what
[41:16] the father has instructed me to do I act
[41:18] in full agreement with his orders arise
[41:20] let us go away from here amen I believe
[41:22] both those scriptures is a bride's
[41:24] commission amen that the devil has no
[41:26] claim in US he got nothing common with
[41:28] us we've got nothing in common with him
[41:30] we should abhor the very thought there's
[41:32] even a little part of him that overlaps
[41:34] our lives amen because we have nothing
[41:37] in common with with him this is the
[41:40] theme of the service right amen so as as
[41:43] as John would write or the Lord Jesus
[41:45] would have written down that he our Lord
[41:48] the king of kings and Lord of lords has
[41:50] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[41:52] now when you wash something you separate
[41:54] the dirt the muck from the Garment amen
[41:56] so the power of blood has loosed us from
[41:58] the chains of Satan amen so if we've
[42:00] been loosed we've been loosed I mean we
[42:02] haven't been partially loosed we've been
[42:04] completely loosed by the blood of Jesus
[42:06] Christ amen so if that be true the devil
[42:08] has nothing to do with us we have
[42:10] nothing to do with him the only thing we
[42:11] got to do with him is cast them out amen
[42:13] it's the principal work of the church is
[42:15] to drive out the devil wherever we find
[42:17] him amen cuz he does not belong where
[42:20] you are and we don't belong where he is
[42:22] amen we belong in Heavenly places in
[42:25] Christ Jesus we don't belong in the
[42:27] carnality the muck and Mar of unbelief
[42:29] and sin and all the nonsense that the
[42:31] devil has now we're going to realize
[42:33] that we're dominated by a spirit right
[42:35] everyone here who is alive has a spirit
[42:37] in them working right amen and so
[42:40] brother Braham says this in the waters
[42:41] of Separation he says if he only knew
[42:43] friend that's spiritual you have to
[42:45] realize that every person has a spirit
[42:47] in them and if the person could only see
[42:50] what kind of a spirit dominated your
[42:51] life that you act indifferent towards
[42:54] Christ You' be ashamed of yourself no
[42:56] matter how you're dressed how well how
[42:58] popular you are with the peoples yet in
[42:59] your heart if God could only turn the
[43:01] Looking Glass to your heart you see the
[43:04] thing is the devil Works in deceit he
[43:06] will make you think that his thoughts
[43:08] are your thoughts he'll make you think
[43:10] that his ways are your ways see he never
[43:13] just comes to you and says I'm the devil
[43:15] think this way no he always puts
[43:17] thoughts in your mind which are first
[43:18] person towards you so for example you
[43:21] know you get big melancholic bit down
[43:23] you say well I feel sad I feel depressed
[43:26] you know I just feel life's too to hard
[43:27] where are those thoughts from they ain't
[43:29] from God Amen now Jesus came to give us
[43:32] life and life more abundantly every day
[43:34] should be a joy and be in excitement
[43:36] because we're walking with our
[43:37] resurrected savior am me every day is an
[43:40] opportunity for him to prove his word in
[43:42] your life amen every day is full of
[43:44] possibility of the supernatural of God
[43:45] fulfilling his word in your life so why
[43:48] would we feel down depressed in the
[43:49] dumps that ain't come from God you see
[43:52] but the Devil Makes Us think it's us
[43:54] thinking that or all to get brother or
[43:57] sister oh they did this she said this he
[43:59] said this whatever no that's the devil
[44:02] trying to bring
[44:03] separation amen but the problem is we
[44:06] think it's us thinking that it ain't us
[44:08] thinking that it is the devil putting
[44:10] those thoughts in your mind even someone
[44:12] asked brother brand and one of the
[44:13] questions that answers how do I know I'm
[44:15] thinking God's thoughts well brother R
[44:16] says well God's thoughts are his word
[44:19] it's not very complicated right so if
[44:21] your thoughts are not matched up with
[44:23] God's word towards one another towards
[44:25] God towards yourself towards the devil
[44:27] you're not thinking the right kind of
[44:28] thoughts it's actually the devil
[44:29] thinking his thoughts in you he because
[44:32] we got to realize that the devil wants
[44:33] to dominate I mean when when when when
[44:36] um you know Pride he was lifted up in
[44:38] Pride and arrogancy when he was when he
[44:41] was the uh you know the Cherub anointed
[44:43] CH that cover and Heaven thought he was
[44:44] better than everyone else there he he
[44:46] had this domination that wanted to come
[44:48] out subdue but his whole plan was to
[44:50] divide amen the great Angelic host and
[44:53] we know that that war that started in
[44:55] heaven amen came down upon on the earth
[44:57] cuz Michael and his angels fought
[44:58] against the dragon and his angels and
[45:00] the devil lost that battle he was cast
[45:02] down to the Earth so now that same
[45:04] battle is come down upon human beings
[45:07] brother man speaks about this in
[45:08] greatest battle ever fought and so that
[45:10] same battle that that was being fought
[45:12] up in up in heaven now has come upon you
[45:15] and I now we've got to realize the
[45:17] devil's purpose in heaven was to divide
[45:19] to rule that was his purpose he wanted
[45:21] to gather gather Angels ZD him to make
[45:24] his own kingdom which was contrary to
[45:26] God's Kingdom so we're going to realize
[45:28] that the same battle comes in amongst
[45:29] you and I because this battle's upon you
[45:32] and I see the devil doesn't want us
[45:34] unified he doesn't want us to have one
[45:36] heart one mind one Accord full of the
[45:39] love of God praising him living for him
[45:41] sold out Blood Washed Blood Bought full
[45:44] of the Holy Ghost he doesn't want us to
[45:46] be a unified group he wants us to have
[45:48] clicks and Clans and different different
[45:51] different things going on in the church
[45:53] this ain't some High School lunchroom
[45:55] right I went to boarding school we had a
[45:58] lunchroom and the the first 15 sat there
[46:01] and eight the Nerds were there and
[46:02] everyone else was kind of there but
[46:04] everyone had their table and their
[46:05] friends and this ain't like that here
[46:08] that's carnality that's the devil
[46:10] dividing Humanity based on bunch of
[46:12] nonsense that don't last too long but no
[46:14] we're here to be United under the
[46:16] Eternal Word of God am mean we're to
[46:18] realize that we're a United body and
[46:20] anything that comes in between you and
[46:22] your brother or sister is actually a
[46:24] demon Spirit trying to divide trying to
[46:27] break the power of the
[46:29] church amen now if this battle's come
[46:33] upon human beings now then as I said
[46:37] before the devil's so crafty he makes
[46:39] you think you're thinking his
[46:42] thoughts if we could only see in the
[46:44] spiritual realm I think we'd look at
[46:46] things very differently I remember there
[46:48] was brother Daniel white at one of the
[46:50] uh where a youth camp uh Youth Camp up
[46:52] in taranaki years ago and he told a
[46:54] story of when him and some brothers went
[46:55] to a restaurant to have a meal and I and
[46:58] and I'm not sure if he or one of the
[46:59] other brothers saw it but there's a
[47:00] waitress there with a lust Spirit on her
[47:02] and and and when the brother saw that
[47:04] Spirit on her he threw up in his plate
[47:06] he vomited because of what he saw he's
[47:08] so shocked and so detested by it but
[47:10] people will look at that say oh look at
[47:12] her but it's a spirit projecting itself
[47:15] through someone and but we can't see it
[47:18] for what it really is what if we could
[47:21] see ought for what it really is Discord
[47:24] malice strife Envy it don't look like a
[47:29] Christian if we could really see it for
[47:31] what it really is we'd run a million
[47:32] miles if we could see unbelief really
[47:35] for what it is sin that that Spirit see
[47:38] if we could really see it for what it is
[47:39] man we would run a million miles and
[47:41] we'd realize I want nothing to do with
[47:43] it then if we want nothing to do with it
[47:46] why do we entertain it why do we make it
[47:48] feel welcome I think we should drive
[47:49] that thing out that ain't welcome
[47:52] here amen everyone's welcome the devil
[47:54] ain't
[47:55] welcome amen this this should be one of
[47:57] the places like your own home should be
[47:59] a sanctuary for the holy spirit of God
[48:01] am mean that God has feel so welcome
[48:02] there ain't any Strife malice trouble
[48:04] there cuz God's in in
[48:07] control amen same thing here don't get
[48:09] too crabbed up on me amen because we
[48:12] have no part in the devil the devil's
[48:14] got no part in US amen now brother
[48:17] brother Braham speaks about how uh well
[48:21] let's just read this from the church H
[48:23] book now he's speaking about the Book of
[48:24] Genesis and Revelation how it's always
[48:26] attack the devil hates to be exposed and
[48:28] in those books he's exposed for exactly
[48:30] what he is Jesus said about Satan he has
[48:32] no part in me I have no part in him the
[48:34] devil would like to prove that different
[48:35] but he cannot so he does all he can to
[48:37] destroy confidence in the word but when
[48:40] the church disbelieves Satan and
[48:41] believes the spirit's revelation of the
[48:43] word the Gates of Hell could not Prevail
[48:45] against her let me just put in a word
[48:47] here from my own Ministry if you don't
[48:48] mind we all uh you all know that this
[48:51] gift in my life is Supernatural it's a
[48:53] gift whereby the holy spirit's able to
[48:55] discern diseases and the thought of
[48:57] men's hearts and other hidden things
[48:58] that only God could know and then reveal
[49:01] to me I wish you could stand with me and
[49:03] see the faces of people when Satan knows
[49:05] he's going to be exposed why do the
[49:08] person's face change because the person
[49:11] thinks it's
[49:12] them but it's the devil right if we
[49:16] could realize this I think we would
[49:18] think a lot differently I think we would
[49:20] treat each other a lot differently I
[49:23] think we could act a whole bunch
[49:24] differently we realize hey this thing
[49:26] that's trying to to motivate my life is
[49:27] not me it's not my conscience it's not
[49:30] my memory it's not my understanding it's
[49:32] the
[49:34] enemy right that if Satan has got a hold
[49:37] of their lives through sin indifference
[49:39] and disease but you should see their
[49:40] faces Satan knows he's going to be
[49:42] exposed and the most peculiar change
[49:43] comes over the people's countenance
[49:45] Satan is afraid he knows that the spirit
[49:48] of God is about to let the people know
[49:49] of his works that's why he hates these
[49:52] meetings so much when names are called
[49:53] diseases revealed Satan hates it now
[49:56] what is this it's not mind reading it's
[49:57] not telepathy it's not witchcraft it's
[49:59] the Revelation by the holy ghost that is
[50:01] the only way I can know this of course
[50:03] the carnal mind will call it anything
[50:05] but the Holy Ghost this why the word is
[50:08] so important see the word should never
[50:10] just be over our heads it should come
[50:12] down right to our address where we're
[50:13] living to the battles of everyday life
[50:16] amen and this is why we need to look at
[50:19] these things because it should be our uh
[50:22] Mantra whatever you call it I have no I
[50:24] have no part in him he has no pardon me
[50:29] hallelujah amen
[50:32] now I'll tell you why Satan fights so
[50:34] much here so I'm just I'm just laying a
[50:37] bit of a foundation I will actually
[50:38] build a
[50:40] house this is the statue of the perfect
[50:42] man brother Bram taught it here from the
[50:44] um you this is from second Peter now we
[50:47] live in an age where is the Capstone of
[50:49] divine love himself comes upon the
[50:51] church right this is the age of divine
[50:53] love now you got to realize why why the
[50:57] devil fights brotherly kindness so much
[51:00] why he causes ought and fussing and
[51:02] fighting and not even Hardy welcomes and
[51:04] a God bless you anymore people people
[51:07] get to be in their Bonnet and they and
[51:08] they and they treat each other they
[51:10] won't even say hello to a to a fellow
[51:12] brother or sister because of something
[51:14] going on in their life he tries to he
[51:17] tries to destroy brotherly kindness
[51:19] because he knows if that's not their
[51:20] Divine love can't come upon people's
[51:22] lives amen because remember we've all
[51:24] got to be capped not just an age or not
[51:26] just a the bride but individuals we to
[51:28] be capped by Divine love himself amen
[51:30] the baptism of the true baptism of the
[51:32] Holy Ghost but brotherly kindness must
[51:34] be on display in order for that to
[51:37] happen this is why this is why this is
[51:39] why the devil brings in niggles and
[51:40] fusses and stews and all this kind of
[51:42] nonsense because he's trying to stop
[51:44] Divine love coming on people do you know
[51:47] how serious it is when we treat each
[51:48] other wrong when we just give an ugh and
[51:51] oh hello how are you doing not even a
[51:52] hearty God bless you and a and a welcome
[51:55] you're stopping Divine love coming on
[51:57] people this is Ser this is the devil
[51:59] trying to stop God living but we're here
[52:01] that God would live isn't that right so
[52:03] we should never get caught up who cares
[52:05] what people have done love them
[52:07] anyway I'm going to jump down to the end
[52:09] of my service right here then we'll come
[52:11] back am mean this oh wait oh wait I'm
[52:14] driving to it once it gets scary I mean
[52:16] this man on the right here Desmond
[52:18] Desmond T dos who's heard of Desmond T
[52:20] dos I mean he won he won uh you know the
[52:23] highest one of the highest um Awards in
[52:24] the American Military because as aican
[52:27] World War II he saved 75 men during the
[52:31] Battle of uh hacksaw Ridge on the um
[52:33] island of okona there against the
[52:35] Japanese now this man this man refused
[52:38] to uh carry a firearm into combat he
[52:41] refused because he was Seventh Day
[52:43] Adventist and he and he took the Ten
[52:45] Commandments very literally that and he
[52:47] said Thou shalt not kill so he enlisted
[52:49] but he refused I'm not going to fire a
[52:51] weapon I'm not going to kill anyone but
[52:53] I'll be a medic and he was ridiculed he
[52:55] was persecuted from basic training all
[52:57] the day to the end of his combat combat
[52:59] times we got to realize he he saved 75
[53:02] men with a
[53:03] bow Bola knot going up this this this
[53:07] this Bluff here I think he's actually
[53:08] standing up there in the black and white
[53:09] photo exposed to um exposed to enemy
[53:12] fire doing far more than he could I mean
[53:15] I mean you know humanly just by himself
[53:17] but with that KN he saved 75 of those
[53:19] soldiers and I bet you a vast majority
[53:22] of them would have been making fun of
[53:23] him for not carrying a weapon they would
[53:26] have been
[53:27] you ridiculing him making fun of this
[53:29] guy oh look at this guy goody two shoes
[53:31] not all kind of hly than that Christian
[53:33] won't even join us in combat he's a
[53:34] coward all these things all these snide
[53:36] remarks would have been fired his way
[53:38] but he went beyond that amen he saved
[53:41] them he didn't care what they said to
[53:42] him what they did to him he was going to
[53:45] get them off the battlefield I mean get
[53:47] them back to safety where they could be
[53:48] treated now if a man you're saving
[53:50] people naturally could do this look
[53:52] Beyond what's being shot at him and save
[53:55] his fellow man how how much you and I
[53:57] amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:00] who cares what snarks and what's niggles
[54:02] and nonsense and drama and who cares
[54:04] about drama smash the drama mask and
[54:06] let's just walk on with God Amen but if
[54:08] he could do that how much more you and I
[54:11] friends
[54:12] amen praise the
[54:15] Lord
[54:18] now that's why the Apostle Paul say
[54:20] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[54:22] spirit in the bond of Peace we're going
[54:24] to Endeavor to keep that Unity something
[54:26] you got to work at like a marriage you
[54:28] got to work at it right a relationship
[54:30] you got to work you got to put effort in
[54:32] energy thought time love emotion into it
[54:35] that's the same thing with keeping the
[54:36] unity of the spirit amen I pray if we're
[54:40] known for anything here that that that
[54:41] we love each
[54:43] other this is a this is a church of love
[54:46] divine love amen that's that's what I
[54:49] pray if we know more than anything else
[54:50] that that that people know these people
[54:52] have genuine Divine love
[54:57] amen praise the Lord but you see now the
[55:00] devil wants to get into human beings and
[55:02] do the opposite now we know as you as I
[55:05] said here there's a statue of the
[55:06] perfect man well in the book of uh in
[55:09] the Book of Proverbs there's the statue
[55:10] of the imperfect man both are
[55:13] religious these six things does the Lord
[55:16] hate yay seven are the Abomination unto
[55:18] him a proud look a lying tongue hands
[55:21] that shed innocent blood and heart that
[55:23] devises Mis uh Wicked imaginations feet
[55:26] that uh be Swift in The Run um sorry
[55:29] feet that be Swift in running to
[55:30] Mischief a false witness that speaketh
[55:32] lies and he that sth Discord among
[55:34] Brethren amen then you go down to uh
[55:38] chapter 26 he that hateth dissemble with
[55:40] his lips and layeth up deceit within him
[55:42] when he speaketh fear believe him not
[55:44] for there are seven Abominations in his
[55:46] heart whose hatred is covered by deceit
[55:48] his wickedness shall be showed before
[55:50] the whole
[55:51] congregation this can be among
[55:54] Believers but this is the devil making
[55:56] an imperfect man with these things but
[55:59] we have no part in him he has no part in
[56:02] US amen he this don't belong in our
[56:05] lives but he the devil wants to put it
[56:07] in and make us think it's
[56:10] us aren't you glad that these things
[56:12] don't belong in our lives at
[56:14] all praise the Lord I trust we hey we're
[56:17] just going to get through this okay amen
[56:20] now the problem with any of the devil's
[56:24] works is is people think as I said think
[56:27] that it's them or or it's not them yet
[56:31] okay now in the book of Acts in Acts
[56:34] chapter 8 when when um Philip goes down
[56:37] to Samaria and uh you know he you know
[56:39] he begins to preach the gospel to them
[56:41] and they get baptized and miracles are
[56:43] done there's one Simon the Sorcerer a
[56:45] great a great man among the people who
[56:47] thought that you know he was he was a
[56:49] man from God and did great things but he
[56:51] just he just Bewitched them with their
[56:52] sorceries but he received the word also
[56:55] and and and he became a Believer but
[56:58] then now he had and uh then what
[57:01] happened is when Peter and Peter and um
[57:03] John came down from from Jerusalem laid
[57:06] their hands upon them they received the
[57:07] Holy Ghost then Simon wanted to be able
[57:10] to do the same thing because his desire
[57:12] was to be a great person still you can
[57:15] get this through me it'll cost you but
[57:17] you can get this through me trying to be
[57:18] someone great among the people and then
[57:21] but then he uh but then he came to Peter
[57:23] and said you know give me um
[57:27] he he offered he offered him money that
[57:29] he could do this but then Peter said to
[57:31] him thy money perish because thou Hast
[57:33] thought that the gift of God may be
[57:34] purchased with money thou has neither
[57:36] part or lot in this matter this is how
[57:38] serious it is when you when you let the
[57:40] devil in and let him rule your life you
[57:42] actually have no part in the matters of
[57:43] God though sincere though wanting it you
[57:46] actually know have pardon it because
[57:47] your heart is not right amen and then
[57:50] and then so Peter would say you know
[57:52] repent therefore of this thy wickedness
[57:54] and pray God if perhaps the thought of
[57:55] thine heart be forgiven thee for I
[57:57] perceive thou in the gall of bidness and
[57:59] in the bond of iniquity but then Simon
[58:02] um answered him and said pray ye to the
[58:04] Lord for me that none of these things
[58:05] which you have spoken come upon me he
[58:07] was already like this he didn't realize
[58:08] it he thought this is just how he was
[58:10] and this is him but it was the devil in
[58:12] his life ruling
[58:15] him we don't want to be like this okay
[58:18] we don't want to be like
[58:20] this now human Shields are are a real
[58:25] thing
[58:27] not just in the natural but in the
[58:30] spiritual people will will bear human
[58:33] shield for the
[58:36] devil either wittingly or
[58:40] unwittingly okay like like this woman
[58:43] here you can see the look in her eyes
[58:44] she's got a baby in her in her arms
[58:46] there's a guy using her as a human
[58:48] shield but you see now if we if we agree
[58:52] if we agree with the devil's thoughts we
[58:54] become a shield from to shoot from
[58:57] right I pray we could really God will
[59:00] just put a light over all of our Lives
[59:02] me very much included and if there's
[59:04] anything of the devil in me I'd say God
[59:06] take it out and shoot it take the Rascal
[59:09] out and get rid of him amen but the
[59:11] thing is if you can't differentiate the
[59:12] devil from yourself you'll always think
[59:14] it's you well you know
[59:17] like anything now remember people people
[59:20] Shield him without realizing it
[59:22] justifying see the devil Works in
[59:24] reasoning he will just ify he's a great
[59:27] salesman he'll he'll sell to you the
[59:29] reason why you should have ought or why
[59:32] you should be unforgiving and he'll give
[59:34] you all the evidence he'll give you all
[59:35] the and because you were there you know
[59:37] because you experienced it right and and
[59:40] and he will he will cause you to hold on
[59:43] to these things that he can shoot
[59:44] through your
[59:47] life
[59:49] see but you know but people say if you
[59:51] only experienced and knew what I did
[59:53] then you'd feel the way I think I mean I
[59:55] mean I mean then you you then you would
[59:56] feel like I'd feel then you would think
[59:58] the same way but if you've ever been
[1:00:00] with Jesus you think very
[1:00:03] differently amen he's the Cure All for
[1:00:06] all these things but you see when when

[1:00:51] other man the reason the nails were
[1:00:53] driven in his hands and feet was because
[1:00:55] of you you and if he could so freely

[1:04:28] leprous put it back in his bosom came
[1:04:30] out well so everything every sin every

[1:04:40] amen says in James submit yourselves
[1:04:43] therefore to God resist the devil and

[1:04:48] the devil submit yourself to God how do
[1:04:51] you submit yourself to him submit
[1:04:52] yourself to his word Lord how should I
[1:04:55] think about my fellow man go look in the
[1:04:58] scripture by this you men shall know you
[1:05:01] are my disciples because you have loved
[1:05:03] one for another love covers a multitude
[1:05:07] of
[1:05:08] sin right all these kind of things that
[1:05:11] that's how you submit yourself to God
[1:05:12] submit yourself to the word of God
[1:05:15] resist the devil see the opposite to
[1:05:16] resist is I mean the opposite of resist
[1:05:19] is to receive CU if you're resisting
[1:05:22] there's a force pushing right if you if
[1:05:24] there's some resistance so if you want
[1:05:26] to get rid of a you if you want to get
[1:05:28] rid of a you the the enemy working in
[1:05:30] your life resist that thing you feel

[1:05:39] my family amen we've been through some
[1:05:42] battles together we've got we've got
[1:05:44] experience together Hallelujah you begin
[1:05:46] to think no Satan I'm not buying you a
[1:05:48] lie about them amen they are a child of
[1:05:51] God no matter what they've done I did a
[1:05:53] lot of bad stuff but Jesus loved me and
[1:05:55] if he loveed me so much to save me
[1:05:57] forgive me and take all my sins away I
[1:05:59] can look at my brother or sister the
[1:06:00] same way
[1:06:03] hallelujah praise the Lord it says in
[1:06:05] Ephesians 2 you ha he quickened who were
[1:06:07] dead in trespass and sins in times past
[1:06:10] you walked according to the course of
[1:06:11] this world according to the prince of
[1:06:13] the power the a the spirit that now
[1:06:14] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[1:06:16] we were all human Shields once upon a
[1:06:19] time we walked according to the prince
[1:06:22] of the power of the Year this is what we
[1:06:23] all did right but then it says but God
[1:06:27] rich in Mercy Hallelujah cuz he wanted
[1:06:29] to you to realize you have no part in
[1:06:31] Satan he has no part in you amen so so
[1:06:34] you once a human shield but then you
[1:06:36] realize hey this is not me this is sin
[1:06:38] this is the devil ruling my life and you
[1:06:41] what did you do you gave your life to
[1:06:43] the lord the devil got dethroned and
[1:06:44] Jesus came in now he's the king of glory
[1:06:47] in your life amen that you're not
[1:06:48] walking by the prince of the power of
[1:06:50] the air anymore but you're walking by
[1:06:52] the amen the Resurrected Lord Jesus amen
[1:06:56] the Holy Ghost
[1:06:58] himself praise the Lord you say well why
[1:07:00] do you know like brother Braham says
[1:07:02] when you got sealed in the devil got
[1:07:04] sealed out the only problem is you went
[1:07:06] out to him right how do you go out to
[1:07:09] him you begin to agree with what he's
[1:07:12] saying you got to look at your thought
[1:07:15] patterns and think where is this going
[1:07:17] to take me is it going to take me that
[1:07:19] I'm annoyed at someone I'm frustrated at
[1:07:21] someone I resent someone I can't stand
[1:07:24] someone who's that that ain't the Holy
[1:07:29] Ghost amen that ain't the Holy Ghost
[1:07:32] friends
[1:07:34] now forgot this here
[1:07:40] right Daniel and and and the three
[1:07:43] Hebrew
[1:07:45] children they they left Jerusalem in
[1:07:48] difficult
[1:07:48] circumstances the temple was B I mean
[1:07:51] you know they got captured they were
[1:07:52] taken away as
[1:07:54] slaves but they begin to realize you
[1:07:56] know because you think about walking
[1:07:58] from Israel to to um Babylon there it's
[1:08:00] a long way to
[1:08:01] walk and no doubt when they were leaving
[1:08:04] uh leaving Jerusalem they would have
[1:08:06] been reflecting a lot how come we ended
[1:08:09] up like
[1:08:10] this why why has why has God sure God
[1:08:13] prophesied it would happen but why did
[1:08:16] he allow it to happen to us and why are
[1:08:17] we in this mess and so what would have
[1:08:20] happened is well I believe that just me
[1:08:22] I like to color in the story a bit but
[1:08:24] they No Doubt because they knew the
[1:08:26] Bible they would have spoken about the
[1:08:27] failures of all the kings of the past
[1:08:30] and they begin to realize you know maybe
[1:08:32] Daniel would have said to his friends
[1:08:33] here listen we are Abraham's Covenant
[1:08:37] children we are we we are sons of
[1:08:41] Abraham God made a covenant with us amen
[1:08:44] we are we are in Covenant with God and
[1:08:48] friends if we can really just come to a
[1:08:50] conclusion the reason that we are in the
[1:08:53] state is because our Kings and our
[1:08:54] rulers and our forbears forgot that we
[1:08:58] have no part in What the world is doing
[1:09:01] around us and we should have no part in
[1:09:03] it they forgot that that's why they were
[1:09:05] worshiping you know the Kings before
[1:09:07] them and so on they're worshiping Idols
[1:09:09] because they forgot that they had no
[1:09:11] part in the world and the world had no
[1:09:12] part in
[1:09:13] them amen they you they they forgot this
[1:09:16] but Daniel and his friends purposed in
[1:09:18] their hearts that they were they were
[1:09:20] going to they were not going to defile
[1:09:22] themselves with the king's meat these
[1:09:24] are young people these are young people
[1:09:26] they realize no Babylon has no part in
[1:09:29] us and we have no part in Babylon sure
[1:09:31] we're going to work there we're going to
[1:09:33] live there we're going to serve the king
[1:09:34] we're going to do what we you know those
[1:09:35] kind of things but anything that comes
[1:09:37] to cross the word we have no part in it
[1:09:41] this is our line we're drawing FRS we're
[1:09:43] going to sink or drown whatever happens
[1:09:45] we don't know what's going to happen but
[1:09:47] but but Babylon has no part in us and we
[1:09:49] have no part in Babylon friends if they
[1:09:51] could stand without the Holy Ghost
[1:09:54] without the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:56] without a resurrection message without a
[1:09:58] church to go to without great singers
[1:10:00] and great musicians and great songs and
[1:10:02] preaching and all these things if they
[1:10:04] could stand just with that revelation we
[1:10:06] have no part in it there has no part in
[1:10:07] us how about us
[1:10:09] friends how about us amen how about us
[1:10:13] hallelujah remember we are of the world
[1:10:16] I mean we we are not of this world we're
[1:10:18] in the world but not of the
[1:10:20] world it has no part in us we have no
[1:10:23] part in it that's why we shouldn't be
[1:10:25] fear feeding off all these things on
[1:10:26] social media and so loving
[1:10:29] it social media in itself is not evil
[1:10:32] but what are we feeding on what are we
[1:10:33] wanting to
[1:10:36] become amen we should be very careful
[1:10:39] what what's motivating our life because
[1:10:41] if those things are motivating our life
[1:10:43] we need a different
[1:10:44] motivator amen we need the Holy Ghost to
[1:10:47] motivate Our
[1:10:49] Lives hallelujah amen so I'm just trying
[1:10:51] to find my bearings here amen so
[1:10:56] we are God's covenant
[1:10:59] people praise the Lord amen Daniel
[1:11:02] Daniel could stand
[1:11:06] there and say I'm not going to defile
[1:11:08] myself with these things this thing has
[1:11:10] no part in me none of the devil's Works
[1:11:12] have any part in me then said now as
[1:11:16] they were God's covenant people so we
[1:11:18] are the morning God has called us by his
[1:11:22] grace amen he was looking for us and he
[1:11:25] was searching for a people that would
[1:11:27] realize they came from God and they go
[1:11:29] back to God Amen this is this is what
[1:11:32] the message came to do to to make us
[1:11:34] realize we came from God and we're going
[1:11:36] back to God and everything in uh in the
[1:11:39] in between that's of the devil has no
[1:11:41] part in us and we have no part in it now
[1:11:44] when Abraham was called Abraham was
[1:11:46] separated from the world God called him
[1:11:49] amen God called him separated him unto
[1:11:51] himself to walk with God now he gave him
[1:11:54] the sign of circumcision to show that
[1:11:56] this is you know that that this is my
[1:11:58] Covenant with you I've separated you
[1:12:00] from the rest of the world now we have a
[1:12:02] far greater Covenant than a than a than
[1:12:05] a physical circumcision but our
[1:12:07] circumcision is by the baptism of the
[1:12:09] Holy Ghost because because God wants us
[1:12:12] to realize sure we were born lost we
[1:12:15] were born in sin we were we were led by
[1:12:17] the spirit of this world but when God
[1:12:19] comes in and makes a clearcut makes a
[1:12:22] division he wants us to know we have no
[1:12:25] Parton the world and and the world has
[1:12:27] no part in us the devil has no Parton me
[1:12:29] I have no Parton the devil amen that we
[1:12:31] would realize that our part is only in
[1:12:34] God praise God Amen so now when Jesus
[1:12:37] was on Calvary he says but God but uh
[1:12:41] God forsaw the bride and the groom
[1:12:43] Hallelujah see so to save his wife like
[1:12:45] Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed
[1:12:47] what he was doing Eve didn't know what
[1:12:49] she was doing but Adam walked out with
[1:12:51] his wife seeing Jesus took his wife's
[1:12:53] place and became sin for her remember he
[1:12:55] became you he stood your punishment that
[1:12:58] you might stand in his place he stood in
[1:13:00] your place that you might stand in his
[1:13:01] place what a love what a fellowship how
[1:13:03] can we deny it how can we do anything
[1:13:05] but love him friend he I could I could
[1:13:08] stand up for hours but let's move on a
[1:13:09] little further like the Pentecostal
[1:13:11] experience today and the coming of the
[1:13:12] Holy Ghost in This last days his promise
[1:13:15] is like the abstract to a title deed now
[1:13:17] you can get a title sure you can get a
[1:13:20] title to a place but that still don't
[1:13:22] say it's yours no sir somebody way back
[1:13:24] Yonder could come in and put a claim on
[1:13:26] it but when you get an abstract that
[1:13:28] shows that everything that's ever
[1:13:29] against it is struck off Plumb right
[1:13:31] back to the foundation is that right so
[1:13:33] there's a search that goes back and
[1:13:35] Strikes off every claim that that that
[1:13:38] anyone could put upon it that's why
[1:13:40] Abraham when he bought the ground for
[1:13:41] Sarah to be buried he made sure the
[1:13:43] boundary was set he made sure that there
[1:13:46] was a public witness this is the
[1:13:48] boundary of this cave um you know
[1:13:49] boundary around this cave this is mine
[1:13:52] um and and they wanted to give it to him
[1:13:53] he says no I'm going to buy it cuz he
[1:13:55] wanted to remove every single dispute
[1:13:58] against that piece of ground that where
[1:14:00] he buried his beloved bride was his amen
[1:14:03] and now we have a burying place as well
[1:14:06] amen in Christ amen and God made sure
[1:14:09] the devil had no claims on everyone that
[1:14:12] was buried in that burying place I mean
[1:14:14] that they would know that the devil has
[1:14:15] no part in them and the and and we have
[1:14:18] no part in the devil right amen so what
[1:14:20] does he do now when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:14:22] down he strikes off everything
[1:14:25] that was held against us amen and that
[1:14:27] gives you permission when you have that
[1:14:29] um um abstract that every bit of it
[1:14:31] belongs to you everything on it belongs
[1:14:32] to you amen and that gives us the
[1:14:34] abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:14:36] this title deed that God saw back Yonder
[1:14:38] for the foundation of the world and put
[1:14:40] it name on The Book of Life it was born
[1:14:43] through a man and a woman and subject to
[1:14:44] sin and guilty of sin but when I
[1:14:46] believed on it I received the deed and
[1:14:48] when the Holy Ghost come it was the
[1:14:50] abstract that everything against me
[1:14:52] whether my mother done it my father done
[1:14:54] it my grandmother done done it I mean
[1:14:55] just doesn't matter what anyone done
[1:14:57] back in my lineage when the Holy Ghost
[1:14:59] came in it struck it all off Hallelujah
[1:15:03] so family curses have no part in me cuz
[1:15:05] they have no part in God am mean
[1:15:07] whatever traits from my family family
[1:15:09] Spirit has no part in me because it has
[1:15:12] no part in God I mean a national Spirit
[1:15:14] fussing and fighting and all these
[1:15:16] things has no part in me because it has
[1:15:18] no part in God hallelujah he says like
[1:15:20] the little epileptic child I prayed for
[1:15:22] a few minutes ago that come through the
[1:15:24] four come through from the grandparents
[1:15:26] epilepsy fell down upon the child I said
[1:15:29] but when the abstract had come it struck
[1:15:31] off I omitted everything I'm an abstract
[1:15:32] holder then amen and ass sure as the
[1:15:34] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[1:15:36] dead I have an abstract deed that I'm
[1:15:38] part of that body and with the abstract
[1:15:41] of the Holy Ghost making that body of
[1:15:43] the word live out just exactly like it
[1:15:44] did in him as he promised in the last
[1:15:47] days the abstract all my sins are struck
[1:15:49] out all your sins are struck out by the
[1:15:51] blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost
[1:15:53] has come as an abstract to the title
[1:15:55] deed that God Gave Me by Grace by for
[1:15:57] knowledge oh my what are you scared
[1:16:00] about what are you scared about amen no
[1:16:04] wonder he said fair not I am he that was
[1:16:06] dead and alive again I am alive forever
[1:16:08] more and have the keys of hell and death
[1:16:10] don't worry about nothing even death
[1:16:11] ain't going to hurt you he says notice
[1:16:14] beautiful so we got to realize now
[1:16:16] everything's been struck off who did it
[1:16:19] God did it God struck off everything
[1:16:21] that was held against us doesn't matter
[1:16:22] how far back everything's gone
[1:16:25] Hallelujah and he puts it in the sea of
[1:16:27] his forgetfulness he puts a sign no
[1:16:29] fishing hallelujah amen so now if if God
[1:16:33] has struck off everything the devil
[1:16:35] could ever try and put Upon Our Lives
[1:16:37] we're to realize we have no part in him
[1:16:40] amen that's why this word has called us
[1:16:42] to a total separation to God is that we
[1:16:45] for us to realize that all niggles all
[1:16:48] fussing all fighting all ought feelings
[1:16:53] that's not from God
[1:16:55] Divine love should flow there should be
[1:16:58] such a
[1:16:59] Harmony in spite of what if oh but you
[1:17:02] don't know what's happened I know what
[1:17:04] God I know what happened on
[1:17:06] Calvary I know what happened when the
[1:17:08] Holy Ghost came into my life I know what
[1:17:10] happened I was
[1:17:11] there Hallelujah I know what so I know
[1:17:14] the full story
[1:17:15] actually Hallelujah why cuz that's the
[1:17:18] full story amen so if that's the case
[1:17:22] then why do we why do we lean to what
[1:17:24] the the enemy wants to put down our
[1:17:28] throats amen so I'm just trying to find
[1:17:30] something here just want to jump back to
[1:17:34] it why do we want to maintain paralyzed
[1:17:36] with a gossip Spirit shooting people
[1:17:38] through
[1:17:39] us oh I just love I just thrive on those
[1:17:42] things why don't thrive on the love of
[1:17:45] God why don't you thrive on Harmony and
[1:17:48] peace and love those are good things to
[1:17:50] thrive on jealousy is not you have no
[1:17:53] jealousy has no part in you malice
[1:17:55] Strife lust whatever it is those things
[1:17:58] have no part in you why why invite it in
[1:18:02] why stand paralyzed and say oh what am I
[1:18:04] going to do and I yeah I'm trapped by
[1:18:06] this thing I'm just a victim of
[1:18:08] circumstance why let it control
[1:18:12] you I just I just feel like I don't fit
[1:18:15] and I and I don't belong who's telling
[1:18:17] you
[1:18:18] that who's telling you that it ain't God
[1:18:20] God says come home come to the table
[1:18:24] you're part of me I want you to be I'm
[1:18:25] proud of you I bought you on Calvary
[1:18:27] you're mine come home amen I want to
[1:18:29] live in your life I want to be I want
[1:18:31] you to be my temple Hallelujah I don't
[1:18:34] want you to be a a a human shield for
[1:18:37] the Enemy No More come
[1:18:40] home oh but I'm justified in what I do
[1:18:42] yeah it's amazing how people use quotes
[1:18:44] and scriptures to justify being a human
[1:18:47] shield oh this is in my life to keep me
[1:18:49] humble who told you
[1:18:51] that I've heard such nonsense like that
[1:18:53] I think no don't try and put yourself
[1:18:55] with the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul
[1:18:57] actually prayed and found out that
[1:18:59] thought In the Flesh and it wasn't
[1:19:01] sin as a thought in the flesh some
[1:19:04] people let sin rule their lives well
[1:19:05] this is this is this is to keep me
[1:19:07] humble no the thing that keeps you
[1:19:09] humble is the love of God in your heart
[1:19:11] shed abroad by the Holy Ghost that's
[1:19:13] what truly keeps a person humble amen
[1:19:15] that's what keeps a person thankful is
[1:19:17] is is God in their lives cuz when you
[1:19:19] really realize God you've separated me
[1:19:23] every part of me to yourself
[1:19:25] hallelujah how can you not be humble and
[1:19:27] thankful and appreciate what the Lord
[1:19:29] has done and love everybody Lord if you
[1:19:32] can find me HW me out of the pit I was
[1:19:34] in that my nature drove me into and you
[1:19:37] cut me out of it you took every part you
[1:19:39] washed me every part clean there's
[1:19:41] nothing there's not a single stain of it
[1:19:43] anymore Hallelujah can he do it for
[1:19:46] someone
[1:19:48] else praise the
[1:19:51] Lord
[1:19:52] amen so friends
[1:19:56] you know we got to
[1:19:57] realize we got to realize Church doesn't
[1:20:00] I'm I'm going to finish with this
[1:20:01] statement well maybe Church doesn't
[1:20:04] finish
[1:20:05] here church is not oh God's going to
[1:20:08] move in church today is it just here
[1:20:11] that
[1:20:12] happens what about what about when we
[1:20:14] have lunch what about when we see one
[1:20:17] another through the week that's church
[1:20:20] God can come down we're two or three
[1:20:21] together in my name there I am in the
[1:20:23] midst have family prayer you can have
[1:20:25] camp in your family prayer time Camp
[1:20:27] atmosphere can come down and change
[1:20:29] everyone's lives because he's
[1:20:33] God
[1:20:34] hallelujah so we got to we got to change
[1:20:37] maybe our mindset that oh when we have
[1:20:39] lunch that it's it's different remember
[1:20:41] Jesus is the same everywhere he was the
[1:20:43] same in the synagogue as he was in Mary
[1:20:45] and Martha's house but but Martha didn't
[1:20:48] realized that Jesus was doing the same
[1:20:51] work talking to Mary that he was in the
[1:20:54] synagogue healing someone and we should
[1:20:57] never see the devil wants us to try and
[1:20:59] interrupt what God wants to do how do
[1:21:01] you know that there's lunches going on
[1:21:03] maybe you're working maybe you're
[1:21:04] helping or whatever more and you see
[1:21:06] someone who's just having fellowship
[1:21:08] with a another part of the body and what
[1:21:11] you're seeing actually is Jesus
[1:21:12] ministering to
[1:21:14] Mary maybe a Eternal moment's going to
[1:21:17] take place in a
[1:21:18] conversation and the devil makes us all
[1:21:21] upset or makes us tries to make us upset
[1:21:24] thinking that's wrong like Martha was
[1:21:26] getting all huffy and puffy because of
[1:21:28] what was going on there but she didn't
[1:21:29] realize churches happening in their
[1:21:33] Lounge we need to look at life
[1:21:35] differently
[1:21:36] Friends Church is everywhere it ain't
[1:21:40] just oh God's going to move on a Sunday
[1:21:41] and a Wednesday what about during the
[1:21:42] week what about when we have lunch what
[1:21:44] about when we meet up see we can't say
[1:21:47] God's different or only God's in the in
[1:21:49] a four walls no God's in these four
[1:21:52] walls and he acts the same everywhere I
[1:21:56] trust so you got to realize that the
[1:21:58] devil's trying to get
[1:22:00] you to be a human shield of
[1:22:03] self-righteousness from to fire shots to
[1:22:05] try and stop God doing what he wants to
[1:22:08] do why don't we just take the devil out
[1:22:11] and just let him
[1:22:12] get killed today why don't we just say
[1:22:17] Lord these things are not me I actually
[1:22:21] Lord you purchased me on Calvary that I
[1:22:23] would have no part in any of the devil's
[1:22:26] nonsense remember Sin is Sin doesn't
[1:22:29] matter how big we call it we quantify
[1:22:31] sin it's all the same in God's
[1:22:33] eyes we have sin has no part in our
[1:22:36] lives we have no part in
[1:22:37] it oh but I'm in this flesh the Holy
[1:22:40] Ghost has come to take this guy under
[1:22:43] Dominion right the Lord Jesus wants us
[1:22:45] to have Victory now not just in the
[1:22:48] Millennium not just in a new body right
[1:22:50] now over every work of the devil

[1:48:24] that that Lord the the whole plan and
[1:48:28] the thrust of the enemy Lord is just to
[1:48:29] take away Brotherly Love Lord from
[1:48:31] amongst us Lord to just work this wrong
[1:48:34] Spirit Lord but you said in your word
[1:48:36] that by this shall all me know that you
[1:48:38] my disciples when you have love one for
[1:48:39] the other Lord and it seems like maybe a
[1:48:42] trivial thing sometimes Lord but try and
[1:48:44] lay hold of it and the devil's there at
[1:48:45] every turn to try and Rob us from it
[1:48:47] every step of the way Lord but we want
[1:48:49] to claim that Lord and claim claim just
[1:48:51] a a
[1:48:53] a love amongst us Lord that that covers
[1:48:55] a multitude of sins Lord that we so Lord
[1:48:58] it makes us not be offended with each
[1:48:59] other it makes us supportive of each
[1:49:01] other it makes us respect each other
[1:49:03] Lord and it just makes your spirit be
[1:49:04] able to move more in our midst when we
[1:49:05] have love one for the other you're the
[1:49:08] genuine love of the Holy Ghost Lord so
[1:49:09] we just pray you'd Lord continue to fill
[1:49:11] each one here with that bless us as we
[1:49:13] go our way Lord fill our way every day
[1:49:15] with love we pray Lord we just um commit
