[15:05] reminder that Friday this put the knee
[15:16] down and the ankle with me came again
[15:35] and wait fee as a man that is breaking
[15:38] out of the sleep and he said unto me
[15:40] what's this now I hold a can full of
[15:46] gold with a bowl upon the top of it and
[15:49] even even fight him and that puts our
[15:54] five the top arrow and two olive trees
[15:57] by it one upon the right start in the
[16:00] fall and the other upon for this by zero
[16:03] I mean at least go to relations
[16:57] behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[17:00] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[17:02] the book and to loose the seven seals
[17:04] thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst
[17:07] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[17:10] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[17:11] as it had been slain having seven horns
[17:14] and seven eyes which are the seven
[17:16] spirits of God sent forth and to all the
[17:19] earth and he came and he took the book
[17:22] out of the right hand of him that set
[17:24] upon the throne amen and when he had
[17:28] taken the book the four beasts in four
[17:30] and twenty elders fell down before the
[17:31] lamb having every one of them harps and
[17:34] golden vials full of odours which are
[17:36] the prayers of saints and they sang a
[17:38] new song saying thou art worthy to take
[17:40] the book and to open the seals thereof
[17:41] for thou was slain and has redeemed us
[17:44] to God and by thy blood out of every
[17:46] kindred and tongue and people and nation
[17:48] and has made us unto our God kings and
[17:52] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[17:55] and then let's just drop down to verse
[17:58] 13 and every creature that is in heaven
[18:01] and on earth and under the earth and
[18:03] such as are in the sea and all that are
[18:07] in them heard I sang blessing and honor
[18:10] and glory and power be unto him that
[18:11] sitteth upon the throne and unto the
[18:14] lamb forever and ever and the form will
[18:16] be said amen in the four and twenty
[18:18] elders fell down and worshiped him that
[18:19] liveth for ever and ever I mean let's
[18:22] bow our heads and a word of Prayer
[18:24] gracious Lord we've come to magnify your
[18:26] name Lord as we just sang magnify the
[18:28] Lord with me come exalt his name forever
[18:31] Lord we're thankful that we have
[18:33] eternity to
[18:33] exalt your name law for the mighty works
[18:36] you've done there God just pray fathers
[18:38] we just look into your scripture this
[18:40] night Lord may you anoint it to every
[18:41] heart father may you just move them up
[18:44] Lord moving our mitts Lord one more time

[19:02] father may meet every need Lord we just
[19:05] want to commit our lives into your hands
[19:07] and we thank you for this opportunity
[19:08] Lord and Jesus Christ name Amen
[19:11] I mean god bless your friends you may
[19:13] you may have your seats this night so
[19:17] notice how we were in and Zechariah how
[19:20] he has awakened out of sleep like a man
[19:23] that was waking down and sleeps on them
[19:25] so the angel that was talking with them
[19:27] came again and and he awakened him out
[19:30] of his sleep and and he was awakened to
[19:33] to see what was already around him and
[19:36] we're living in a day now where where
[19:39] God has done many mighty things and he
[19:42] is doing many mighty things but we need
[19:44] to be awakened to what he's doing as as
[19:47] brother Brown would say in in the
[19:49] contest and this is the New Year's Eve
[19:51] message of 1962 he sees Heavenly Father
[19:54] as we stand here as many thoughts is
[19:56] dying out in our hearts and the mistakes
[19:59] of the last year and as we're
[20:01] approaching the death of 62 in the birth
[20:03] of 63 he says Oh God may we be one step
[20:07] higher up the ladder until we see Jesus
[20:10] and his program I mean it's very
[20:12] important that the oh that the Lord
[20:14] would lift us heart that we would see
[20:16] Jesus and his program I mean because
[20:18] it's one thing to see Jesus but you need
[20:20] to see his program you need to see where
[20:21] we are in history and we need to see
[20:23] where we are and the the pages of the
[20:25] book because we know that you know this
[20:27] will be this will be fulfilled but we
[20:30] need to know where we are in order to
[20:32] know where we're going and it's just
[20:34] like a map you can you can have the map
[20:35] say of New Zealand and say you want to
[20:37] drive to Auckland but if you don't know
[20:38] where you're starting from it's gonna be
[20:40] pretty difficult I mean you may drive
[20:42] this way and this way till you find a
[20:43] landmark that eventually but if someone
[20:45] can just tell you hey this is where you
[20:47] this is where you need to go to then you
[20:48] can travel I mean and that's why the
[20:50] speeches messages come that God has
[20:53] announced to us we're not at the
[20:54] beginning of the time of redemption but
[20:56] we're at the end amen and we're not just
[20:57] after the claiming because we know
[20:59] redemption has two parts there's there's
[21:01] a purchase of redemption then there's
[21:03] the claim of that that has been redeemed
[21:04] I mean and we know we're not living in
[21:06] the beginning where where Redemption has
[21:08] been purchased we're not in the first
[21:09] church age we're in the seventh church
[21:11] age we're at the end where now what he
[21:14] has purchased he's come to claim
[21:15] hallelujah so now now when when when
[21:18] John was John was lifted up into the
[21:21] throne room and then finally there came
[21:23] a point where where he was he was
[21:26] weeping you know he saw that seven
[21:28] sealed book was in the hand of the
[21:29] original owner no but no man was seen
[21:32] worthy to take the book and he wept much
[21:33] because he knew that if no one could a
[21:36] man if a man could not stand yo come
[21:38] forth be proven worthy to take that book
[21:40] then all of creation was in jeopardy I
[21:43] mean but then an elder told him don't
[21:45] weak John because the line of the tribe
[21:47] of Judah has prevailed now we know a
[21:50] lion he goes a judge he's come to Brio
[21:52] his wrath is going to be poured out upon
[21:53] the earth but when John looked he didn't
[21:56] see you a lion gonna pour out his wrath
[21:58] gonna judge the world you know pour his
[22:01] wrath out but he saw a lamb hallelujah
[22:03] and I trust when you see him tonight I
[22:05] mean when you look into this message you
[22:07] don't see the line of the tribe of Judah
[22:09] that's gonna pour it as judgments in the
[22:11] tribulation but you see your lamb we
[22:13] know we know he's one of the same
[22:15] believer I trust when you look when you
[22:18] look under Jesus you see a lamb you see
[22:20] your high priests you see the blood I
[22:22] mean you see your advocate I mean you
[22:24] you see your intercessor you see your
[22:26] husband your mediator hallelujah I trust
[22:29] you see him I mean when you look into
[22:30] the message so now in order for a
[22:33] thought we know we're living in the time
[22:35] of of the bride's revival amen
[22:39] yes sir we're living the time of the
[22:41] bride's revival and just like brother
[22:43] Branham would would would relate the
[22:45] story of the Welsh revival and you know
[22:47] there were people from America they date
[22:49] they traveled over to Wales hearing
[22:51] there was a revival and they wanted to
[22:52] see where this revival was and they met
[22:54] a policeman and he's any swinging his
[22:56] baton on the street and maybe worse
[22:58] thing I'm so glad I can say
[22:59] them and they and they can to see good
[23:02] sir can you tell us where this revival
[23:03] with us Welsh revivals on because
[23:06] they're expecting big banners big big
[23:07] building you know a big advertisement
[23:09] and they and then he just said sirs you
[23:12] found it it's in me hallelujah because
[23:15] the policeman was awakened to what God
[23:17] was doing in his day I mean he was
[23:19] having a revival because he was awakened
[23:21] to what God was doing he was no longer a
[23:23] God of history no more but he was a God
[23:25] of the present
[23:26] I mean it's when the Messiah becomes
[23:28] present to you I mean when you your eyes
[23:31] come up and you see him in his program
[23:33] you see him today I mean that's when you
[23:35] have a revival hallelujah and that's
[23:38] what we are enjoying hallelujah
[23:41] I mean we're enjoying the brides revival
[23:44] I mean and where is the revival it's in
[23:47] me I trust it's in you the awakening is
[23:50] in you hallelujah it's not in your
[23:51] neighbor next it's you that have been
[23:53] awakened by the message of the hour
[23:56] hallelujah so Amen now we we understand
[24:02] that you know the next thing that's to
[24:05] happen in God's programmers is the
[24:08] rising of the denser rising of the dead
[24:11] in Christ the translation of the Living
[24:13] bride with them to meet the Lord in the
[24:15] air
[24:16] I mean this this must happen before you
[24:19] know the great trip year before this
[24:21] world goes into the Great Tribulation
[24:23] but before this happens there must be a
[24:26] bride take her position in Christ I mean
[24:29] there must be if people take their take
[24:31] their position heavenly places in Christ
[24:33] Jesus rule the powers of the devil are
[24:35] under their feet and I and I believe in
[24:38] I trust that we are climbing higher
[24:40] every day I mean the people the things
[24:42] we once battled are now under our feet
[24:44] and now we may be facing new battles but
[24:46] that's okay because we're we are
[24:48] victorious we're campaigning on I mean
[24:50] we're conquering Devils as we go
[24:52] hallelujah by the grace of the Lord
[24:54] Jesus Christ but there must be a bride
[24:56] must take her position in this hour now
[24:59] we know from the reading of the
[25:00] scripture that faith cometh by hearing
[25:02] and hearing the Word of God I mean so in
[25:05] order for our eyes to come open amen
[25:08] we need to hear the word it's vital
[25:10] that's why we don't need to hear what
[25:12] the news is say
[25:13] I mean we don't need to hear other
[25:14] voices we need to hear the word for this
[25:16] day and that gives us faith amen and
[25:19] then we know faith is a revelation and
[25:22] with the revelation comes an awakening
[25:25] to a realization of who we are in him I
[25:27] mean we need to know who we are in him
[25:29] hallelujah and that will give you
[25:31] overcoming power hallelujah amen listen
[25:36] you know and so you know you take the
[25:40] woman at the well she was living her
[25:43] life she thought this is how she's gonna
[25:44] be but then she met Messiah
[25:46] she had a revelation we know where
[25:48] Messiah cometh he'll do these things and
[25:50] he just said he that speaks to him he
[25:52] made her her whole life was transformed
[25:55] hallelujah
[25:56] why because she was awakened to what God
[25:58] was doing in her day and she realized
[26:01] she was part of what God was doing I
[26:03] mean not just looking as an onlooker or
[26:05] sitting in the grandstand watching but
[26:07] she realized she was part of the word
[26:09] for her day amen and this brought her to
[26:13] an awakening now brother Branham would
[26:16] say now the bride's revival is tied into
[26:18] the taking of the book amen
[26:21] revelations 5 John types you come to the
[26:24] end of 7 Church ages he hears the same
[26:26] voices spoke to a minister you know and
[26:28] the church ages is the same voices in
[26:30] him and saying come up have their doors
[26:31] open and he's lifted up into the
[26:33] eternity
[26:34] showing that at the end of the church
[26:36] ages amen the bride takes a rapture one
[26:38] man and a vision represents a whole body
[26:40] of believers I mean so his revival was
[26:43] happening not when the book was sealed
[26:45] in the hands the original owner 5 will
[26:47] happen when the lamb stepped forth the
[26:49] one that he leaned on the bosom of him
[26:51] when yo in the days of his flesh the one
[26:53] he saw dying on the cross the one he saw
[26:55] resurrected was now the one who stepped
[26:57] forth to take the book that caused him
[26:59] to have a revival because he was
[27:00] rejoicing saying everything in him and
[27:03] under heaven and the sea everything
[27:04] heard him say blessing and honor and
[27:05] glory be to the Lamb why because he saw
[27:08] his redeemer stepped forth to claim what
[27:10] he purchased hallelujah and that
[27:12] produced a revival in the bride I mean
[27:16] and it's the same thing with you and I
[27:17] trust I mean when you hear the seals I
[27:20] mean when the word comes open I mean I
[27:22] trust you don't just see tribulation and
[27:24] horse riders but you see the land
[27:26] step four you see your redeemer step
[27:28] four to claim you hallelujah I trust
[27:31] that's what you see Amen hallelujah
[27:34] because because what your brother says
[27:38] is like Romeo and Juliet we're a damsel
[27:40] in distress
[27:42] hallelujah we're stuck up in a place and
[27:44] he comes live at night puts his ladder
[27:46] up against the wall takes us away
[27:48] hallelujah that's what's happening in
[27:51] this hour
[27:52] I'm glad amen
[27:55] so you know sir our revival is tied into
[28:00] taking of the book amen hallelujah
[28:04] so our revival is based on present tense
[28:07] what's going on right now when brother
[28:09] Graham preached to sit yeah you're the
[28:11] you know the series of the seven seals
[28:13] in the opening of the word after that
[28:14] that was an event because he said you
[28:17] know you know we read it there in
[28:18] Revelations five I heard the voice of a
[28:21] strong angel proclaiming who's worthy to
[28:23] take the book and you go listen to the
[28:25] breach sir you're a message and he reset
[28:27] scripture it says maybe I'm just feeling
[28:29] this way but let him leave heaven come
[28:31] forth now hallelujah why cuz an event
[28:33] the word is coming open to a people I
[28:36] mean they many of them didn't catch what
[28:38] was going on but it's the same thing
[28:39] with with Israel coming out of Egypt
[28:41] Moses is standing there in the book of
[28:43] Deuteronomy they're been through that
[28:45] wilderness for forty years he says I
[28:47] your eyes weren't open you did not have
[28:49] a heart to perceive what God has done
[28:51] until this day so they were journeying
[28:54] along you know they were with Moses they
[28:56] saw the pull off I come down on Mount
[28:58] Sinai many mighty thinks but Moses says
[29:01] you didn't understand what was going on
[29:02] but now you understand because you're
[29:04] gonna enter into a new land hallelujah
[29:07] and it's the same thing with the message
[29:09] many people didn't catch what was going
[29:10] on I mean but the pillar of fire are
[29:13] still here with the bride and then
[29:14] finally when the son of man ministry is
[29:16] opened and a worldwide body why what
[29:18] happens we're entered into a new land
[29:19] the land of the son of man Jesus Christ
[29:21] and then our eyes have come open now we
[29:24] understand who we are hallelujah now all
[29:27] the church fighting you should be done
[29:28] away with although all the man age
[29:30] anointing should be gone the Eagle
[29:32] anointing has come to take us up into
[29:34] the heavenlies hallelujah
[29:37] amen basically I'm just gonna throw a
[29:41] whole bunch of stuff at you and I trust
[29:43] you going listen I mean you got to see
[29:46] it's listen our national identity does
[29:50] not give us a revival no matter how
[29:52] wonderful this country is it will not
[29:54] give us overcoming power the news cannot
[29:57] give us overcoming power Facebook
[29:59] doesn't give us overcoming power
[30:00] Instagram won't give us overcoming power
[30:02] none of those things will help us
[30:04] overcome this present world only this
[30:07] word will give us overcoming power
[30:09] I want to overcome I don't want to be
[30:13] the devil's punching bag I want him to
[30:15] be my punching bag hallelujah that's
[30:18] what we're all dating opinion amen
[30:20] hallelujah so you know we need to delve
[30:25] into things hallelujah so now the taking
[30:29] of the book as I see it you want to have
[30:31] a revival get into the word prayerfully
[30:34] and God will open things to you and
[30:36] you'll see yourself very differently to
[30:39] how you started I mean say Lord minister
[30:43] to my heart it's not trying to put it
[30:45] all together this is not a homework you
[30:47] know this is not a school you know
[30:49] homework exercise it's Lord ministered
[30:52] to me show me who I am
[30:54] I mean because John's identity was tied
[30:56] up with the book palookas he knew if
[30:59] that book wasn't taken he was stuck
[31:01] hallelujah but when he saw the lamb step
[31:03] forth he rejoiced because he knew now
[31:06] though that the plan of redemption was
[31:08] going to wind up hallelujah
[31:11] so what John wasn't cymbal has to become
[31:14] reality we saw the horse riders they
[31:16] became reality I mean the tribulation is
[31:19] going to become reality
[31:20] so John taking the book I mean John sing
[31:23] the book taken that revival has to
[31:26] strike the earth and I believe it has
[31:27] amen and then John been given the open
[31:31] book of revelations 10 taking becoming
[31:32] one with that word and prophesying it
[31:34] forth we are living in Revelations 10 8
[31:36] to 11 amen
[31:38] you got to see your position in the word
[31:42] Amen oh yeah now
[31:49] whether MCS in the and the breach
[31:54] message he says notice he's not an
[31:57] animal he took the book out of the right
[31:59] hand of him that sat up on the throne
[32:01] you know this message has had just to
[32:03] get us things that's so glorious isn't
[32:05] it wonderful
[32:06] isn't it great how Redemption how
[32:07] wonderful redemption is a man when you
[32:09] see him he's not a God of history he's a
[32:11] God of the present and he came to become
[32:13] one with you came to redeem you come to
[32:15] open your eyes to who you are I mean
[32:18] because the opening of the book maybe
[32:19] I'll just jump right to the end of my
[32:21] sermon that I'll do a backtrack and come
[32:22] back to it again but the book represents
[32:24] you amen you're part of that book of
[32:28] redemption
[32:28] now when the seals were loosed off the
[32:30] book the contents of it became
[32:32] manifested epic it was him it was sealed
[32:34] up but then it came open so what was
[32:37] hidden became manifested now it's the
[32:40] same thing with you and you hallelujah
[32:44] was a brother bad calls at a scene g'd
[32:47] of God placed in your soul but it was
[32:50] laying dormant just like a natural sea
[32:52] can be laying dormant just like now it's
[32:54] well it I think winters finally turned
[32:56] up you know hopefully it doesn't stay
[32:57] around too long we'll get spring at the
[32:59] right time but you know this seeds of
[33:01] the laying in the earth and they can be
[33:03] laying in there until finally the right
[33:05] atmosphere comes weather where the Sun
[33:08] moves a bit you know the earth moves a
[33:09] bit closer to the Sun you know you're
[33:11] our part of it you're the soil
[33:13] temperature gets warm enough there's a
[33:15] right and a right amount of moisture and
[33:17] sunlight then finally that seed that
[33:19] we're sitting there comes to life and
[33:21] what was locked up in the seat now comes
[33:23] forth holy it can be a mighty oak tree
[33:27] or it can be whatever it is but what's
[33:29] in it will come forth hallelujah
[33:31] so so what was sealed up and it comes
[33:33] out and it's the same thing with you and
[33:36] I there's a life sealed up in us there's
[33:39] a mystery that had to be manifested I
[33:41] mean there was laying in our souls but
[33:43] it took the right conditions and it
[33:45] wasn't denomination or the world that
[33:47] was the conditions
[33:48] those are frosty freezing places a man
[33:51] needed to be a right kind of place

[34:04] time the spies didn't give it to her
[34:06] they didn't say oh we brought the
[34:08] scarlet cord as a true token you have it
[34:11] no she said oh this is in my house and
[34:14] this thing that was laying dormant in
[34:16] her house I don't know how long just
[34:18] like this like the scene in you laying
[34:20] dormant they finally faith cometh by
[34:22] hearing and hearing the Word of God and
[34:23] then finally something this was dormant
[34:25] is now very powerful hallelujah now has
[34:29] has eternal life in it
[34:31] hallelujah and then stir the thing that
[34:34] was in her house I don't know what kind
[34:35] of didn't even know what she had but the
[34:38] two messages had to go see awaken her
[34:41] faith in what was in who could be
[34:42] manifested then her family come and
[34:44] receive eternal life well it's happening
[34:47] deals a mystery sealed up and Rahab she
[34:49] was never meant to be Rahab the harlot
[34:51] when God thought of her that wasn't her
[34:53] in state I mean her in state was to be
[34:56] married to Salman of Judah and coming to
[34:59] the lineage of Jesus Christ that's how
[35:01] God thought of her I mean but that was
[35:03] locked up in her hallelujah amen
[35:06] Israel had to come her way her whole
[35:08] life had to her old life had to be
[35:10] destroyed hallelujah I mean why I was
[35:14] locked up in her you take Joshua you

[35:45] maybe there'd be some doubt I don't know
[35:47] too good to be true it was in him it was
[35:51] in him but I had to come unlock there's
[35:53] a mystery sealed up it had to be
[35:55] manifested you can go through all the
[35:57] way down through the Bible you can take
[35:58] that whole same thought to every
[36:00] character through the scripture David's
[36:02] a shepherd boy you know you're gonna be
[36:04] the king he didn't become king by the
[36:06] anointing of Samuel the anointing just
[36:09] activated the kingship in him amen so
[36:11] then he
[36:12] become king because the anointing it was
[36:14] a recognition God was testifying of his
[36:16] gift
[36:17] hallelujah has the same thing with you
[36:19] and I that's why this word we have
[36:21] indicated prophet in this day I mean and
[36:23] he poured out the whole Word of God the
[36:26] whole anointing was poured out Samuel
[36:28] didn't just drizzle a bit on David the
[36:29] whole anointing horner Vernonia was
[36:31] poured out upon him hallelujah because
[36:33] he had to become king as the same thing

[36:49] aiming it was already in him just like
[36:53] the bride is already in you to be the
[36:55] bride is already in you the scripture
[36:56] says that we are predestinated and to
[37:00] the adoption of sons I mean we're not

[37:04] and maybe we'll get you know we've
[37:06] previously and to the adoption or the
[37:08] placing of sons hallelujah that means

[39:08] them I met kinsman-redeemer
[39:10] I am the mediator my blood was shed I've
[39:12] become I have become man and I did this
[39:15] in order to get that church back again

[39:20] of the world I have purchased it I spoke
[39:22] it it would be there and nobody was able
[39:25] to take it but I went down and done it

[39:39] kinsman redeemer oh my what a sublime
[39:42] statement or act hallelujah now he has
[39:45] the title deed to redemption he has it
[39:47] in his hand mediation is done now he has
[39:50] it in his hand remember it's been in the
[39:52] hand of God all the time but now it's in
[39:54] the hand of the Lamb now watch the title
[39:56] deed of redemption of all creation is in
[39:58] his hand and he comes to claim it back
[40:00] to for the human race not to claim it
[40:01] back to angels claimed it back to the
[40:04] human which was which it was given for
[40:06] it to make sons and daughters of God
[40:07] again bringing them back to the Garden

[40:16] you feel good
[40:18] hallelujah now when brother Brahim
[40:22] speaks about the lamb taking the book he
[40:26] he parallels it with
[40:28] Boaz claiming roof that's why I say you
[40:32] you the book represents you hallelujah
[40:36] so guys from justice
[40:38] abstract thing too now very real thing
[40:41] haloo so he says now notice that kinsman
[40:44] redeemer the kinsman and the kinsman
[40:46] redeemer must be born of the human race
[40:48] there
[40:49] that leaves us on a limb but let me
[40:51] sound a trumpet to you the virgin birth
[40:52] produced a product amen
[40:54] the virgin birth produced our kinsman
[40:56] redeemer none other but Almighty God
[40:58] became Emmanuel one of us Emmanuel the
[41:01] kinsman redeemer was met you see how God
[41:03] makes a requirement and there is nothing
[41:05] we can do but then grace the upset and
[41:08] overshadows that law and produces the
[41:09] product amen
[41:11] oh when we get over home when I get my
[41:13] little cabin down there that brother
[41:16] Neville's things about when you all hear
[41:18] singing down there one morning singing
[41:20] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[41:22] saved a wretch like me
[41:23] he said praise God oh brother brother
[41:25] made it there he is yes oh it's a mate
[41:28] it's grace that taught my heart to fear
[41:30] was grace my fears relieved how precious
[41:32] did that grace appear the hour I first
[41:34] believed I mean here a few a few notes
[41:37] being flattened over there that'll be my
[41:39] job
[41:40] hallelujah wait till we get down to it
[41:42] just in a moment
[41:43] he says the Book of Ruth gives a
[41:45] beautiful picture of this how Boaz and
[41:48] noemy had lost the estate you know
[41:49] youyou heard me preach I haven't you
[41:51] raise up your hands if you've heard me
[41:53] preach you understand Boaz had to become
[41:55] a redeemer and he was the only one they
[41:57] could he had to be a kinsman near
[41:59] kinsman and and in Redoute redeeming
[42:02] Yomi he got Ruth and that was Jesus Boaz
[42:07] typing Christ and when he redeemed
[42:09] Israel he got the Gentile bride
[42:11] hallelujah
[42:13] see see so he ties the taking of the
[42:15] book to Boaz claiming Ruth that Gentile
[42:19] bride now in Ruth Ruth is sealed up of
[42:23] mystery as well I'm coming back around a
[42:25] few times go I want you to catch this
[42:26] and Ruth her life was there because
[42:31] there's a there's a change of
[42:33] dispensation happening in Israel they're
[42:35] going from judges to Kings Amen judges
[42:39] to Kings and God puts a Gentile bride in
[42:42] that change of dispensation and it's the
[42:44] same thing with us so God was changing
[42:46] form through a Gentile bride it's the
[42:49] same thing now if God goes brother
[42:50] Branham says to the
[42:51] changes in your son of God and then he
[42:53] son of David in the Millennium but in
[42:55] between Tommy's son of man I mean so now
[42:58] God calls a Gentile bride and that
[42:59] change of dispensation why because he's
[43:02] going to be son of David in the
[43:03] Millennium on the throne but he has to
[43:04] go from son of God to son of man to son
[43:07] of David but he has to use a veil to
[43:10] change his dispensation hey you're
[43:12] following me I mean just like he had to
[43:14] use you know just open the church first
[43:17] came in here was God above us then he
[43:20] had to use a veil to be God with us then
[43:22] God in us hallelujah
[43:25] there's a change in dispensation from
[43:26] judges to Kings as a Gentile bride has
[43:29] come and to change it dispensation
[43:30] I mean God was veiled hallelujah just
[43:34] like yesterday but now he was roost so
[43:36] and who was this she was to be the
[43:37] grandmother of kings she didn't know it
[43:40] imagine going to my web
[43:41] hey Rick how are you I'm good
[43:43] everything's going fine you know you're

[43:49] husband this first nature is going to
[43:51] die he can be married to another what do
[43:53] you mean no this is me this is where I'm
[43:55] from this is who I am
[43:56] and you could say now this is not who
[43:58] you are you think this is who you think
[44:00] you are but this is not who you are
[44:02] hey sure this is where I was born I can
[44:05] show you my parents I can't you know
[44:08] you're looking through the wrong eyes
[44:10] father you say you're gonna look through
[44:12] the eyes of prophecy hallelujah because
[44:15] in her was to be no one else could marry
[44:17] boys to bring forth Oviatt and Jesse and
[44:20] David no one else could do she had to be
[44:22] the one hallelujah there are many to the
[44:25] natural I think there many other people
[44:27] who would qualify a lot better but no it
[44:31] was her hallelujah and God allowed her
[44:34] to go through what she did
[44:36] amen God allowed God caused her to do it
[44:40] hallelujah why to bring forth Oh be to
[44:44] be married to Boies she didn't know that
[44:47] was sealed up in her but then now just
[44:50] like when the lamb took the book opened
[44:52] the seals showed the contents of the
[44:54] book what was really in it same thing
[44:56] with when women boaz took ruth
[44:58] i'm going to show you what's in her
[45:00] hallelujah
[45:02] whoo she's really meant to be
[45:05] amen that's why we're gonna you know
[45:07] otherwise fix that spiritual amnesia how
[45:10] you breaks Brittany Jie go to go to
[45:13] familiar places one way to get special
[45:16] Abney jie is to be between two opinions
[45:18] he says to be you can be between two
[45:21] opinions shall I serve God sure not so
[45:24] if God as God writers not writers the
[45:26] message writer is it wrong
[45:27] are these people writer these feel wrong
[45:29] what's happening to opinions my friends
[45:30] say this but what about this what you're
[45:33] between two opinions you begin to get
[45:34] spiritual amnesia you begin to forget
[45:36] who you are I mean that's why you've got
[45:38] to forget those things and fine go walk
[45:41] to through familiar places parlor that's
[45:45] where you're going to do if you want to
[45:46] keep your identity in this hour I mean
[45:48] because what is what is the biggest
[45:50] focus in this world today identity
[45:52] identity politics I mean and it's such a
[45:57] big thing identity even once her own
[45:59] identity in their own nation all those
[46:01] things some of it's fine but it's all
[46:02] identity white because it's the age of
[46:05] the people's rights what about the
[46:08] bride's rights what about the Lambs
[46:10] rights what about the bride's identity
[46:14] amen what about what about our identity
[46:17] polio whose I who you really identifying
[46:21] with
[46:21] identify with this amen you got a you
[46:27] know who you know what's your flag
[46:29] what's your anthem hallelujah what's
[46:32] your national dish hallelujah glory to
[46:36] God you know because it's all about
[46:38] national identity you have to know where
[46:42] you're from because the devil doesn't
[46:44] want you to know who you are
[46:46] imagine if you know why did Saul fail
[46:49] because of because he leaned too much on
[46:51] well I'm from the smallest tribe the
[46:53] smallest family the smallest tribe in
[46:54] Israel and here and he tried to please
[46:56] people these complexes pushing him
[46:58] around but David wasn't that way David
[47:01] was anointed by the same prophet I mean
[47:03] he knew he was going to be king and he
[47:05] leaned upon my identity is upon that in
[47:07] that anointing
[47:08] hallelujah my identities in the prophecy
[47:11] I'm going to become king hallelujah amen
[47:15] so we need to look at the same we need
[47:17] to be the same way Lord
[47:19] this is a bridegroom call this message
[47:21] is a bridegroom call it's not a list out
[47:24] of different church and be a bit
[47:25] different kind of call
[47:26] no it's a bridegroom calls it's a
[47:28] marriage call that's what it is to call
[47:31] a bride for Jesus Christ that's why the
[47:34] message came I mean so if it decrypt
[47:36] your soul I know I well apparently it's
[47:39] bad to repeat yourself but you know you
[47:43] know I probably say it a lot but why did
[47:45] this message find you if it's a
[47:47] bridegroom call and it found you it's
[47:49] because you are the bride amen and the
[47:52] and the foolish virgin doesn't care
[47:54] about her position in Christ but the
[47:57] wise virgin wants her position I mean
[48:00] you you know I I don't know the
[48:02] scripture of top of my head but you go
[48:04] to the Book of Numbers there's five
[48:06] daughters they're dead don't have any
[48:09] brothers their dad died in the
[48:10] wilderness because of his own sin and at
[48:13] that point her daughters couldn't get a
[48:15] position in the promised land and they
[48:17] come to Moses say Moses our father died
[48:19] we didn't have brothers but we want a
[48:21] physician at the moment we can't because
[48:24] the law says we can't but we want a
[48:25] position and Moses goes ask God and God
[48:27] says they've seen a good thing they've
[48:30] asked a good thing
[48:31] so here was the wise virgin saying we
[48:33] want our inheritance in the land
[48:35] hallelujah the law says we can't but
[48:38] Grace will give it to us
[48:39] hallelujah I mean so it should be the
[48:42] same thing with you and I I don't just
[48:44] want to be going with the crowd I want
[48:46] my inheritance in Christ I want what
[48:48] belongs to me I want what's in the book
[48:52] for me hallelujah
[48:54] that's the wise the foolish doesn't care
[48:57] I don't want to be foolish I want to be
[49:00] wise I want to take my god-given prey
[49:03] place hallelujah amen you know you know
[49:08] if people you know if anyone comes to
[49:10] God with that kind of heart lord I want
[49:14] what you died for I want to receive what
[49:17] you died for do you think he's going to
[49:19] turn that kind of heart away no he's
[49:22] gonna say oh I'm looking for people like
[49:24] that
[49:24] Carl ouya I'm looking for people that
[49:26] want their inheritance their position
[49:28] and me hallelujah
[49:33] amen so Ruth Ruth and who was to be the
[49:39] grandmother of Kings to bring about a
[49:43] dispensational change in Israel and here
[49:46] we are the church ages of coming to an
[49:50] end
[49:50] we've been lifted up out of this world
[49:52] you know we should have different
[49:54] thinking to this world I mean we should
[49:57] have totally different thinking if
[49:58] because we understand the church here
[50:01] the world is still in lady ousia
[50:02] increase with goods rich increased with
[50:05] goods have need of nothing they can do
[50:06] it all themselves and look where it's
[50:08] headed
[50:08] you know but we are called out of it I
[50:11] mean we we are being called in what
[50:14] program calls into a bride age I mean
[50:17] because lady I see a rejected Christ the
[50:19] word so now he's got to find a place
[50:21] where he can still work Redemption and
[50:23] prevent calls on a bride age hallelujah
[50:26] and in that bride age now we've received
[50:28] an eagle anointing I mean where well
[50:31] what does that mean an eagle can fly the
[50:35] the first three anointing was the was
[50:37] the lion the ox and the man anointing
[50:40] all earthbound creatures but the eagle
[50:43] was the only one that could fly up and
[50:45] see a mean so well well how does that
[50:47] work in your life you should be able to
[50:49] look above just just what you see around
[50:52] you
[50:52] you should be lifted up above just what
[50:55] you see with your five senses and what
[50:56] your mind can reason amen you should be
[50:59] able to see beyond that's how it works
[51:02] it's more than just you know knowing how
[51:05] the message goes together that's that's
[51:07] really not it SQL to discern and
[51:10] withstand the Antichrist birth and the
[51:12] only way you can do it is with that
[51:13] eagle anointing that Holy Spirit eagle
[51:16] anointing how Lou you that's what we
[51:18] should have we should be able to see oh
[51:19] there's the devil there's the devil
[51:21] there's a devil
[51:22] amidst chili bowser and he'll could you
[51:25] know and you can see further than that
[51:28] you know anything else it's not
[51:29] earthbound amen that's how we should be
[51:34] amen
[51:36] so we shouldn't be looking you know you
[51:39] take Saul and David David was still I
[51:43] mean Saul was the man age and it came to
[51:46] a
[51:46] where he was judged the kingdom was
[51:48] taken from him and he his Armour was
[51:53] brass which is divine judgment p'lice
[51:55] armor was divided it was was brass as
[51:57] well they received the same kind of
[52:00] judgment that system came to an end
[52:02] and God had a little shepherd boy that
[52:05] was going to go beyond house all thought
[52:08] and house all the things and he was
[52:10] going to actually take the throne and
[52:11] take the whole land
[52:12] why was happening that going for a man
[52:14] age to an Eagle age and that's how it
[52:17] was that's how it was in Christendom
[52:19] there was all these big ministries
[52:21] around hidden shoulders above the rest
[52:23] the man of the hour with power those
[52:26] those time have come to an end amen
[52:29] we're not under that kind of does the
[52:31] man age man's ideas man's words of
[52:33] Pentecost was the last move of the
[52:34] Reformation amen now we know God just
[52:38] adds he doesn't take away so we have
[52:40] everything the Reformation had but now
[52:41] we're transformed hallelujah so so so
[52:46] David comes along and and Saul tries to
[52:49] put this brass armor please read the
[52:51] story it's brass yeah so so Saul tries
[52:54] to take his judgment and say fight with
[52:57] this thing and David said no this won't
[52:59] work this ecclesiastical vswir and
[53:02] freedom why because God actually I said
[53:05] no man's wisdom doesn't work man's Bible
[53:07] school system doesn't work man seminary
[53:10] symmetry doesn't work it's not going to
[53:12] defeat the giant right so see I can't
[53:15] wear this it doesn't work so he just
[53:17] went with what he had hallelujah and it
[53:21] didn't look like much but it's all he
[53:23] needed hallelujah
[53:25] and it's the same thing with us that's
[53:27] why we don't lean on the understanding
[53:28] of man amen it's not about get a general
[53:32] consensus and then we'll walk on with
[53:34] that notes an individual walk with God I
[53:36] mean David knew he was anointed and he
[53:38] was going to be king that's why he knew
[53:40] why he was anointed you've got to know
[53:43] why you're anointed why this word has
[53:45] anointed you why is it anointed you
[53:47] because there is a place and then Jesus
[53:51] throne that you will sit to he that
[53:53] overcometh in this age you will sit with
[53:55] me and my throne as I've set with my
[53:57] father in his throne hallelujah that's
[53:59] why you've got a Rick
[54:00] guys why has this word come to me
[54:02] because I'm the Bride of Christ and I
[54:05] have a Dominion I'm going to sit in as
[54:06] as a ruler joint heir with Jesus Christ
[54:09] amen
[54:10] we're not just here just have wonderful
[54:12] time go out forget who we are how Lou
[54:16] you know we've got a you to look at
[54:18] where are we going where are you going
[54:20] in your Christian walk what's the end
[54:23] goal this is going to be changed why
[54:26] because I've received an anointing that
[54:28] will change my body hallelujah I've got
[54:32] it in me
[54:32] amen and just like thee just like the
[54:35] seals were taken off the book to reveal
[54:37] the contents of it and I'd say the seals
[54:39] would take it off Ruth's life you know
[54:41] to Moabite with nothing just gleaning in
[54:44] the field striking along not even in the
[54:46] economy of Israel no you want me to be
[54:48] part of the lineage of Jesus Christ
[54:50] hallelujah because her place remember
[54:53] her place in God's Word was not to be a
[54:56] widow there's no one here does there's
[54:59] no you know to be a widow you don't have
[55:02] any part of the land that's yours you
[55:04] don't have any inheritance right but God
[55:07] ordained that she wouldn't stay that way
[55:08] but that she would become married to
[55:11] boas did now basically him belongs to
[55:14] her I mean so so God moved her that she
[55:17] would receive her position in the land
[55:19] hallelujah that was the mystery know she
[55:21] was me tree part of missing him
[55:23] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[55:26] us we're we're all dating to be part of
[55:28] this word Amy it's not by what we think
[55:31] we ask what God has ordained us to be
[55:33] that's all that matters hallelujah
[55:37] you take Rahab Rahab's living under a
[55:40] death sentence
[55:41] a mystery son whom hallelujah
[55:45] she and Salman found a bitly him
[55:47] hallelujah Amen but they had to come
[55:53] open Jericho's the land was sealed up
[55:57] because Jericho was there once Jericho
[55:59] was taking the land was open up for his
[56:01] role to go in and conquer hallelujah
[56:03] it's the same thing the book came over
[56:05] the whole land the son of man came open
[56:08] Rahab was living there right there I
[56:10] mean but God ordained that she would
[56:13] actually receive
[56:14] inheritance in the promised land
[56:16] hallelujah
[56:17] I mean why don't you receive the spies
[56:19] because she had to have had a place in
[56:21] the land and that place was given her in
[56:23] the land because she'll be united with
[56:24] Salman hallelujah amen as it says in
[56:29] Romans 7 no you're not brethren for I
[56:31] speak to them that know the law how that
[56:34] the law hath dominion over a man as long
[56:36] as he liveth for the woman which hath
[56:38] her husband is bound by the law to her
[56:40] husband as long as he liveth but if the
[56:42] husband be dead she is loosed from the
[56:44] law of her husband so then while her
[56:47] husband liveth she be married to another
[56:48] man she shall be called an adulteress
[56:50] but if her husband be dead she is free
[56:52] from that law so that she is no
[56:55] adulteress though she be married to
[56:56] another man
[56:57] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[57:00] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[57:02] that you should be married to another
[57:04] even to him who's raised from the dead
[57:06] that you II should bring forth fruit
[57:09] unto God hallelujah why could ruse be
[57:13] United two boys because the first
[57:14] husband was dead hallelujah amen that's
[57:18] like our our our union with the world a
[57:21] man was killed hallelujah Christ killed
[57:24] it I mean that we could be united to him
[57:26] hallelujah amen
[57:30] so it's what need to think about these
[57:34] things why are we here
[57:37] why is you know why are we why are we
[57:40] rising in the character of Christ while
[57:44] we're becoming more like him
[57:46] because he has ordained us to end up in
[57:48] a certain place predestination means
[57:51] your destiny is predetermined amen
[57:55] you have but you have to have confidence
[57:57] and where God wants to take you I mean
[58:00] David then didn't worry about what
[58:02] people were doing like Saul was he was
[58:05] anointed because and he knew that
[58:07] anointing would take him to the kingship
[58:08] cuz and him was to be the king he had
[58:11] confidence in that how about you I mean
[58:17] I'm just gonna read a psalm and then
[58:19] we're gonna quit Sam 57 I believe it is
[58:49] I believe it this I've been having a
[58:51] good time in the Sam's it's so wonderful
