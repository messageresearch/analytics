When I [music] need a shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the rock. Amen. You can um you can take your seats this morning. I'm just going to put this here. I've just got a little testimony that I'd like to um share with you for five minutes if that's all right. It's um I'm a very shy person naturally. I'm and I'm a I'm a I'm a natural loner, believe it or not. Like I could I if I had it my way, I'll be up in the bush with nobody just doing not much. Okay. But so this whole life that I live is not by choice [laughter] being up here doing all this. So you end up to be like a bit of a you do sort of a lot of public stuff which is not really my thing but I've accepted over the years that that's the way it is. So then you have to do it. So um I just want to share a little testimony about this stuff like this cuz I kind of stuff happens to me publicly and I it's but it's to you know I want to give the Lord glory for it and and it seems to be just the way that works. So, does that work there? Okay. Um, you know, I've been working on this film for about it would be 5 years in, uh, like January, so in another two months, it's been like a 5year project to make this certain film. So, um, I can click it. Um so 2021 that let's say January I started writing a script for it and I had an idea before that but I wrote that till about took about 6 months to write the script and then I we did all the pre-production planning and planning about 30 or 40 different locations and 97 1970s props and everything you could imagine. We're going flat out doing that. And then we all through 2002 we film this and I edit the whole thing, most of it. Then we we do little pickup shots in September and like the stuff even did that in September of that year. And um and then we we shot the last big scene which was a World War II scene in January of um 2023. And we get everything we need for it. You know, like this this thing costs well in the uh uh 1 2 3 4 5 six figures well into it. But we get everything we need to do it. But then it all just comes to a grinding halt. Like this whole project just was and it and life as I knew it came to a grinding halt for like I couldn't do anything for like two years. It was just like and this so this this project was kind of like essentially I almost gave up and it was like it was dead. It's like man I came that far then it was just like this dead project. So for two years it was just like I could not get this thing to move and then uh till the start of this year it was I don't know something just you just keep going and going and then cuz I think I told you that before you just get told to walk forward. So I and I this year we we we started the um I thought we're just going to get this thing done somehow someway. I talked to Jess and we were just going to like we'll figure something out. Um, so we did this fundraising little campaign. What we got from that was nothing like what we needed. It was not even going to be a drop in the bucket, but we did it anyway. It's more of a I think I did it more of a thing for me to at least feel like I'm getting somewhere on it, but I knew it wasn't really going to achieve anything on the grand scheme of it. Um, but you know the story the the we ended up getting a the main cost was VFX and we ended up getting this become a good friend of mine who we this Academy Awardw winning VFX guy did all the VFX essentially for free and then we had enough to the sound guys were doing their thing and the and then we had enough because he didn't charge anything we had enough to sort the sound out and then sort the colorist out which are the three we need VFX sound and color were the three big things we needed right so so we had all those components in place and so that's been I've been at that all year happening thing each week I've been doing stuff and guys have been doing this and that since yeah for the whole year and um now we've got um and then I I locked in a date of when this thing was going to be finished and screened right which was 19th of December and the 21st of December was the the screening date for this thing because when you lock a date in then you have to finish it and and this this isn't really a like this is it's not a massive a big deal. It's not like a big blockbuster, but but we've booked um we've booked the cinema in Wellington, which was the biggest one we could get for that date, and we've booked this one here in Masterton, which was the biggest one we could get there. So, we booked the biggest cinemas cuz these and these cinemas, as we speak, are like there every seat's taken in these cinemas to watch this film. That's [snorts] that's happening in like three or four weeks, the screen. So, this is like a this is an event. It's not like, oh, if we don't get it, if we don't meet the deadline, it doesn't matter. It's like there's hundreds of people turning up to watch this thing. It's like this. So, but I kind of had this I had this idea about two weeks ago. I was like, I think I'll just go cuz I've got to deal with other stuff. I haven't been paid for about 2 years. I might might go and earn some money. I think I'm a bit over not being not having any money. So, I like flag. I'll just go flooring and I'll deal with this um film stuff on the side at nights and stuff, you know. I was like I'd do flooring for 12 months and at least be like a normal man, go to work in the morning, [laughter] get paid. Um, so I did that for two weeks and that these there were guys working on the film just doing their thing and I was just kind of keeping up. I I did know what was going on cuz I I had my finger on the pulse. I it's not like I left it to the side. I was they were doing their thing. Um, so I thought and then then two weeks into it, I had big big big plans and then this happened to me, which was this. So, and it essentially ruined all my plans. I'm like, I was just getting into this new found way that I was doing things. This has just ruined everything. I can't floor like that, and I can't do much like that. And it's like, you know, and you you you wonder, you think, this is kind of strange. just like I I kind of had this planned everything was going to work out and I was going to do these things but it but you know you just think oh the Lord's got some sort of plan which is what I was actually texting I think it was brother John Andy's at the time we were texting about something and I said oh it's all right the Lord's got a plan a better plan than what I've got anyway so but I have to say that happened on a Sunday and then on the Monday I stayed home and thought well I can't do anything now I might as well just work on the film full-time cuz we're showing it in a month you know I better look into this thing get it sorted And and it was um after only a day of I just was home all day and I was working on it and working with this this sound guys and then within about 24 hours it dawned on me actually these I don't want to I'm not going to tell you who these guys are cuz I don't want to I'm not going to talk bad about people but this particular sound company I realized that they cannot pull off what they said they were going to pull off and and they've been they have been they might hear this so I won't say too many bad things but it's been It hasn't been pleasant, right, from for a year. But like they could not pull off what they said they could pull off and it was going to be to a substandard like and I didn't actually know this cuz they were kind of like it was all sort of like they were they they they didn't know how to do it essentially. They know how to do some stuff but this major componentry which is all the foley and this proper stuff that makes the film come to life in the sound department they could not do it. They did not know what they were doing but they didn't tell us that. And I was waiting for stuff and I was putting the pressure on to find stuff. But it was through being home for that day and into the next day. I thought like like I got mental clarity. I thought I've got to stop this right now and change everything because this is not going to happen. Like these guys are not going to do it and we're going to go to the screening and it's just going to be it it's going to be rubbish. You know, like people are going to watch it and go, "What was that? The sound is massive in film." And um and yeah, it just happened that on that the next day there was a guy I was going to use over in um Bulgaria. He's done stuff for me before. And he he said I said, "I need help, man. I'm in a total pickle here. I need I need this done in like three or four weeks." And he he said, "Look, it's your lucky day. I've got nothing on right at the moment. I've got a month spare." He's got his whole company. This is how in dire straits we were. He's got his whole company working on the film. So that happened on the 21st. He's going to struggle to get it to me on the ETH, which in film you need to export out all these DCPs, which what is what the theater plays. And these are massive files. They take like a day or two to even you push export, you know, and it takes like a day or two to export this thing out. You got to wait for it. Then if it's wrong, you got to do it again. You don't get many chances at this cuz the screening's on like the 19th. So you got to get it to the cinema. They've got to play it, make sure it all works and all that. So, and he and and this guy is he's got his whole company on this thing and he's going to struggle to get it finished on the 8th. And there was one guy thinking he was going to do the whole thing by the eighth. It was like, but the the thing about it was I didn't know this was happening, but the Lord knew it was happening. And and that's what I it kind of it struck me. I'm like, you know, the the cuz I would have this is like this like a ship here, you know, like I would have gone on for another week or two just flooring cuz you get quite busy. You focus, you a week goes by, you just check out a few things at night and it would have been two weeks before I really would have picked up we got a problem. And like a big ship, you can like if you need to turn this point in order to get it to over here. If you let it like this, I'm not I can't stress how much this was the problem. The Lord has solved it. Like if it was two more weeks, this thing would not have been sorted. It would just we couldn't have reached it. But pretty much something dawned on me and I knew I just got this. It's like the Lord saying, "You need to change it today. Change it now. Otherwise, you're not going to get this thing done." And he like, "Stop me. Put me at home. Change it now and do it all." And it's like I I still marvel because I think I did not know this was happening but the Lord just stepped in drastically and and because I think he wants it to be finished and to show there. I think he does you know cuz I didn't I don't plan this you know I had other plans. I would have my testimony today would have been oh can you pray for me? I'm in dire straits almost, you know, cuz this has happened in the film, you know, or maybe next week I would have asked for prayer. But um yeah, I just I just wanted to Yeah, I just want to give the Lord thanks and just just share what's been happening because you know, you go along in life and you I'm glad that the Lord knows more than we do. Now, I've been fortunate in this situation to see the answer of this pretty fast cuz sometimes you this happens to you and it might be a year or two before you know why it happened. So, we don't always get things and we suddenly neck a few days later. Wow, I see why that happened. You know, but sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. But I'm convinced that in all things, the Lord's got a control of our life. Even if it looks like it's bad, &gt;&gt; it's not, you know, and it's it's I just want even this to be an encouragement. Even if your situation looks like it's bad, it's not. The Lord knows you. He knows what you're going through. He knows everything. And he's looking out for you. He's looking out for me. And he wants to achieve his purpose in your life &gt;&gt; and in my life. And I'm glad he's faithful. &gt;&gt; You know, he's he's faithful enough that he'll override our feelings like, "Lord, why did you do that to me?" He's like, "You'll see." [laughter] He's faithful enough that he'll do that to us. And I'm so happy that he's like that. Like he's he has my best interest at heart and he knows what's best for me even when I don't. So, yeah. So, let's um that was my testimony wanted to share this morning. Let's stand and just sing one or two songs as we um just before we call up brother Ben. Let's do um let the weak say I am strong.

Praise the Lord. Um let's turn in the scripture to Colossians chapter 1 and um also we're going to go to uh Acts um 3. It's so true, brother Isaac. All things work together for good. You know, I mean, we're never out of his care. Doesn't matter what things look like. Amen. So, uh, Colossians 1 and verses 18 down to 29. Just going to read this here. Amen. So, Amen. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. and having made peace through the body of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself. By him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven, and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. He makes you in that condition. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I think we'd be happy for a while, can't we, with that? Amen. All the way into eternity. If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, are made a minister, uh, who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his body's sake, which is the church, uh, whereof I made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. uh even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus, where unto I also labor, striving according to his working, which workketh in me mightily. Amen. And and I'm just going to read uh I don't have it on the PowerPoint here, sorry. But in Acts chapter 3, uh we have uh Peter and John there. We're just going to read uh verse 6, but Peter and John have go by the gate, beautiful. They're going into the temple and there's a lame man there that was lame from his mother's womb. And um this is just a bit of a context and and we just read verse six here. I don't know if you want to put that up or not. Um so and then it said, "Then Peter uh well, let's read from verse uh four rather. And Peter fastened his eyes on him with John and said, "Look on us." This is the lame man. And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up. And immediately his strength and ankle bones receive strength. And he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God. Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning. Amen. If you have a need, just want to raise up your hand to the Lord. Say, Lord, remember me. Don't pass me by. He always comes where he's invited. Gracious father, we just want to lift your name up high. Give you, Lord, praise you onto your great name this morning. Thank you, Lord. We can sing truly all our lives. You've been faithful, Lord, that you are mighty, Lord. You're awesome, Lord God. We I just pray, Father, that Lord, as the service goes on, may you just take the highest place in all of our lives, Lord. May you be the principal theme of our lives. May you be our all and all. Father, not just here, but those who are streaming, those who are unwell in body, I pray you touch them. And dear God, you see the hands that have been lifted. Lord, I pray you just meet every need behind that hand. And as we've read your word, I pray you'd anoint it to speaker and hear, Lord. Do what you want to do, Lord, in this service. We give you right away to do whatever you want to do in our lives. So come change us, mold us, renew us, transform us, Lord. Meet us, save us, Lord. Whatever heal us, dear God. Whatever we Lord, whatever you want to do this service, Lord, we just want to stand back and say, Lord, have your way. We love you, Lord. We thank you. And may you bless this time in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats this morning. So, I want to, if I could take a title, I want to speak about the body of Christ, which is you and I this morning. Now, we read we read here in uh Colossians that he is the head and and and we are the body. Now, this is this is a very powerful thought where uh when because many times we well some people think of well well he's the body and we're just the church but we're actually being made one where that all that Christ is all that God poured into Christ he poured into the church okay so every attribute every every part of his divine nature all that he is is actually living and walking in you this morning so I pray that that you know this will become very real as we go through this I'm just going to just going to go on a bit of a journey but you see there's this great mystery and this is what the message of the hour is. If anyone asks you what is this message you believe it is Christ in you the hope of glory that is the opening of the seals that's the you know the church ages that's all the restoration of the truth it is for Christ in you the hope of glory that's the purpose behind the message okay so now this is a great you know I was just reading this and just think about as Paul would say that God would make known unto us the riches of the glory of this mystery so there's great riches within this that Christ in us the hope of glory now it says in Romans chapter 5 that Um here we are. He says uh for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by death of his son. Much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life. And not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement. Now this word atonement is actually a word which means at onement. So you're no longer two, you're one. Okay? Now this has this is more than just two parties coming close together, right? that there's actually both becoming completely one. And the reason I bring this out is because the atonement has a far more deeper meaning than well, I'm just at one with God uh in terms of uh you know uh what I'm trying to say is that the fact is that the magnitude of it is is all that Christ is he's poured into you, &gt;&gt; right? There's no longer you can't see like you know like if my hand was you you you can't see any surgical uh scar from my hand being attached to my arm there. My body is at perfect at one with itself. &gt;&gt; Okay? There's no join. There's no connection. Right? All that's in my mind now is manifested through my body. Okay? So a true you could say the atonement is manifested in me by my hand being part of my arm. You can't see you know it's not just my hand is close to my arm. It's part of it. It's one. You can't see where one starts and one finishes. Right? It's the same thing with us in Christ. You can't see where God starts and you you know you know God ends and you start like there's a join somewhere. You become perfectly one. Okay. So that means that all that Christ is now he's poured into you. So now when you look at a person right now so like I'm thinking so maybe I'll think subconsciously I'm thirsty so now the thought will go to my hand the hand will pick up the bottle I'll open it and then I'll drink it right so my actions are just the expression of my thought okay so so now with a believer if God is in you then your action should be an expression of his word right because you're at one with him right so it's not like it's not your carnal mind trying to be a Christian it's actually God in you being the Christian through you right this is really what it means to be at one with God that your mind is sure you have your human mind but there's a greater mind within you I mean the mind of Christ so that all that he is now is in you right so so so if um you know so my character that I am is now manifested through my actions so if I'm a stubborn person or a selfish person that may be just in my mind but now it'll come through my life my attitude how I talk the things I do the things I don't do is because of what's in my thinking now or my spirit comes through my bo you know through my body Right? So you can see what I am in my heart by my actions. Okay? So it's the same thing now with God in his body which is the church. Right? You see all that God is. You see living, walking, talking, breathing, moving, acting through you and I. Amen. Now that means that now that's a perfect atonement has has taken place. Now this is me in my little diagram. So I want to show you this now. So before before God ever came your way, there was a chasm. There was a wall, middle wall of partition. So there was you and there was God. There's a great chasm, right? You were far off. But God didn't want you a far off. He didn't want you wandering in darkness doing your own thing. He wanted to bring you and and bring you and atone you to himself that he could express his word through your life perfectly. Okay? So, so he didn't want you because because you're part of him from the beginning, right? And his thinking, he didn't want you just wandering around in chaos cuz there's one thing God can't do. He can't lose one of his attributes. It's impossible for him to lose you. Amen. If you're his attribute, you you can't be lost. You may wander, stumble, up and down, in and out, whatever more, but God's going to get you because you're part of him. Cuz he came looking for you. Amen. Not just anyone. It's whosoever will, let him come. But he came looking for you. Amen. So now there's a gulf that was between us and us and you know, God and and and we could not bridge that gulf. Not one man could not save another. It took God to become a man to redeem us. I just want to labor these kind of elementary points because I trust it'll mean something now. And then Well, that's interesting. Okay. Why is that not there? Anyway, there's meant to be like a red line between God and man. Okay. So, the blood now brings us together, but there's not a gap. True atonement doesn't mean you're just close. Cuz some people can be, oh, I'm close to God. Like, I'm in church and I'm, you know, I feel him close. And God doesn't just want to be close. He wants to be in you. I mean, he wants to live through your life. He wants to be where it's no longer God like there's no gap. It doesn't matter how close that gap can be. Like even even the pyramid, they say the great pyramid, you can take a razor blade and you can't even put it through the blocks. That's not true atonement cuz the blocks are just close together. True atonement is just be one big piece of stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. With all it shape and everything, that'll be a true atonement. You can't see where one block ends and the other block starts. If it was a true atonement, as like you and I, God has now joined us that we are now one unit like here in the bottom. See? See? It goes from this to this. Now where does the go where does God start end and where does the man start and vice versa no one unit that's true atonement Christ in you the hope of glory he makes you one so he says now he says now Christ you are sometimes a far off okay let's go down to so for he is our peace and made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the emnity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace So it's one new man that he's made. So and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the emnity thereby. So now this this is this this fact is we ain't us and God ain't two different people. We are his body. He's our head. Right? He does we are not a headless body. This message came to resto restore true headship of the word of God in our lives. So now with the believer, we and the word become one. Us and God become one. You can't find a gap, a separation. I trust this means something. It meant a lot to me. Okay, it made me happy. So hopefully it'll make you happy at some stage. See, now so in Ezekiel, he would say this that God would God would bring up residence. You know, many people say, "Well, God is on the throne of my heart." Who's heard that saying? &gt;&gt; Is he the king of your life? Is is is is he on your throne? And if he's on your throne, that means he's the ruler. He's the Lord. That means what he says goes. Okay? It's not actually not you. You're the temple that he lives in. So, he's going to express his will. Amen. So, when the Holy Ghost truly comes into someone, their thinking changes, their actions change because the king was once Satan. He got dethroned. God takes up his rightful place and then he begins to rule. Okay? So, that means all of his nature can be expressed. All that he is can be expressed. Not just a part of himself. See, this is more than just healing. This is more than just prophesying. This is more than just No, it's that eternal life can be administered. I mean, because all of his attributes are now are within you. Cuz remember, the Holy Ghost that's in you is not a different spirit to him. It's not a Yeah, I know I've been through this. Maybe this is the conclusion of how many months we've been down this trail, but you know, you know, this is that we don't have a religious spirit. We don't have an argument. We don't have a nice idea. We have the living God. I mean the one who made heavens and earth comes and dwells in you and then because he is within you. If he says body move you move body pray you pray body fast you fast. Is it because the thoughts come down transmitted down a mean into your life and you and and he leads you. He motivates you. He guides you and because it's his thinking. It's his word and he will never lead you contrary to his word. I mean he'll never take you in a place that's outside his word because he is his word and you become one with him. And if you keep your human will surrendered to his. Amen. and he'll lead you into all truth. Amen. So, he says, "I'll put my spirit within you." See, many people, they just get a new spirit. God, you know, because, you know, we can't even live with ourselves half the time. Brother Bram says, you know, we have a stony heart to begin with. We don't even believe that the word is true. Then God gives us a new heart, a soft heart. We can actually say, "Yes, this scripture is right." But that's not that's not the end thing. Amen. It's when God when he says, "And I'll put my spirit within you." Amen. You know, if you're struggling in your Christian walk, you say, "God, fill me with the Holy Ghost or refill me, Lord. Refresh me in your presence, Lord." Amen. Because he says, "And I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my judgments and do them." Why? Cuz the king is in residence here. Amen. It's not a religious spirit. It's the king. It's not a national spirit. It's not an antichrist spirit. It is the spirit of almighty God is in residence here. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Apostle Paul would speak about how we are the body. We are the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. He says, "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself." So a man who really loves himself loves his wife. I trust there's some brothers here who really love themselves. Amen. For no man ever hateth his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. Amen. So the apostle Paul is bringing this parallel that we are the body of Christ. Amen. We are his body. We are his bones and his flesh. Amen. And so if any man hates his own wife, he hasn't the right revelation. He is living under legalism. He's still under the blood of bulls and goats. He has not received the atonement. Amen. Because what does God do? He's not He loves his body. He cherishes his body. Amen. We are his victory. Amen. We are his greatest achievement upon the earth is a redeemed people filled with his spirit. This is God's great design of his plan has been I want a people who out of their own will, not out of fear, not out of obligation, not out of a duty, but out of a love, amen, will serve me, walk with me, worship me, give their all to me, and I'm not going to force them. I'm not going to put pressure on them, but I'm going to woo them, amen, by my spirit. I'm going to brood over them. And amen, their hearts are going to come open to me. And that seed that's in their soul is going to come to expression. Amen. And they're going to be made in my image. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he wanted. So he's never hated. He doesn't hate his body. He's not He's not ashamed of his body. He's proud of his body. Amen. And it should be the same thing with a husband. You know, we should never see my ambition. My ambition. You want to hear my ambition? I want to see that woman lifted up high that God can live. I'm not just talking about her. I'm talking about this whole church. That's my life. That's what I want to see is that God would come down and fill every fiber of every being and be manifested and be glorified through every life. That's my whole ambition. I believe that's God's ambition. Amen. He wants to lift up a people washed in his blood without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that God can just flow through so freely. There's no jam. There's no complex. There's no log. There's no problem. Amen. That they hold on to. Amen. That stops God living. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; If I do that, I've lived a good life. &gt;&gt; I've lived a life of purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. And anyone who comes, any man or woman or child that comes under the blood of Jesus Christ really receives the atonement. That's the thrust of their life. That's their their ambition. They're not wishy-washy floating along. They have a purpose. Lord, I want to see you live. I want to see every divine promise be manifested in the body of Christ. I don't want to push you down, hold her back. I want to push you forward. You can do it. Amen. Why would the Apostle Paul say, "Run this race." I mean, let us run. Amen. He's not saying, "No, hold back and quit and just no, you can't do He said, "No, run this race. You're made to run." Amen. You're built to overcome. Amen. You are built of stuff that the devil can't can't knock over, can't crush. Amen. You're made of a material which is far greater. Amen. Than than than than any substance of in creation naturally. I talk about your what's in your soul, that seed of God. Amen. That is made of the word. Amen. And God wants to see that word come to manifestation. Amen. That's why he sent this message. Amen. To get a hold of your life. If I'm preaching, I'm going to preach for a little bit. And you got to realize that you're the body of Christ. Amen. And he loves his body. Amen. He cherishes his body. We are all members of that same body. Amen. So why on earth would we think we're not worth anything? You're very valuable. You're more valuable. Elon Musk couldn't buy you with his money. &gt;&gt; The UN, whoever he they you they have they don't have the thing that can purchase you. Amen. By the blood of Jesus Christ who was shed on Calvary. Amen. That was the only thing that God could give. Amen. The highest price that had to be paid was his own life. And he gladly gave that price cuz he said, "You're my body. I'm not leaving you separated from me. I don't want to have a chasm. I don't want to have a gulf. I want to be one with you. I want you to receive this atonement that all that I am, I pour into you." Amen. That you can amen that that he can live through us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are all members of his body. Don't ever think you're not part of part of the word of God. That's the devil lying to you. He's not a part of you. Jesus said he has no part of me. I've got no part in him. That's why he the devil tries to tell you you got no part of the word because he doesn't have any part of the word. But you've got all part of the word. Amen. When Jesus died, he was thinking of you. Amen. He wrote an inheritance for you. Amen. Of peace, love, joy, overcoming power. Amen. To be made in his image. That's what God thought of when he died on Calvary. That healing would be yours. Restoration would be yours. Peace would be yours. Amen. A dominion would be yours. Amen. that this the authority of the believer would be manifested in your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. M slowed down. We got to realize, no, you've been given a ring of authority. Amen. Where where the prodical son came home and the father said, "Give him the best robe." Not just a robe, but an adoption robe, a placing robe, a robe of authority. What the father was wearing now, the son was wearing. Give him a ring. Amen. It wasn't just any ring. It was a seal of authority upon his finger. Amen. And God, you know, the father knew that son now had the character, amen, to use that ring, amen, to to seal the word of God to be manifested. And just like Esther was given the ring of Hmon. Well, it wasn't Hmon's ring. It was the king's ring. Amen. But Hmon took it out of deceit. Amen. But what happened? It was restored into the into a hand of character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where she could write a law, amen, to to to get deliverance for her people. Amen. That the vengeance of the king could come upon the enemy. Amen. And what has God put in your hand? What does he put on your your finger? A ring of unmmerited predestinated grace before the foundation of the world. You got to realize that you're packing something. Amen. That is far like Peter said to that lame man, such as I have give I thee. &gt;&gt; He didn't have money. He didn't have a sevenstep program to walking. All those things are maybe fine, but he didn't. But what was he carrying? He was carrying mercy. He was carrying deliverance. He was carrying liberty. He was carrying God. All of his attributes were now walking in two feet past that man. And he was looking like, "Oh, maybe they can help me naturally." And Peter, cuz God moved on him, was saying, "I've got far more than what you're expecting." &gt;&gt; And maybe you're not expecting much in church this morning. I tell you what, there's one greater. Amen. The one that walked in Peter and John by the gate, beautiful is now walking by your way this morning. Amen. That he can such as he has. He gives unto us. Amen. Through his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we can rejoice. You got to realize, what am I carrying this morning? It's far greater value. You can't buy it. You can't earn it. You can't solve it. It's God. &gt;&gt; He wanted to pour himself into your life. Brother says that God wants to give us the Holy Ghost more than we want to receive it. &gt;&gt; So, if you've got a hunger to be filled, he's got a far more desire to fill you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not trying to hold it back. No, he just pours it out without measure. He's a very generous God. I mean, he's not a He's not a frugal God. He's very generous. He pours his spirit out without measure. And especially at this end time where where where the moving of the Holy Ghost has been totally undamned by the dams of creeds and dogmas of men. Amen. Brother Bram said that the Holy Ghost, the full power of God moving was bound at the church door, but now that's been busted open. Amen. There's been some dams that have been blown up. Amen. that the flow of God can just move service after service, prayer time after prayer time. You read the Bible, God just pours out his oil and wine and you stagger around cuz it's so great. Hallelujah. Was that cuz there's no restriction to the moving of God. Amen. God doesn't want to be restricted. He doesn't want you to be restricted. He don't want He doesn't want you to be held back with a well, what? No, it can't be me and I've done too much wrong and I've done this and thought this. That's irrelevant. I mean, the blood is greater still than anything. There is nothing under the sun the blood of Jesus Christ can't solve or fix. &gt;&gt; Otherwise it's limited. It's unlimited. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now Jesus was asked about uh marriage all these things and they twain shall be one flesh. So then they are no more twain but one. Twain means two. They become one. Right? So we're not twain of with God. There's not two of you. There's one of you. All right. I I will be with you even in you to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see the thing is what happens is there's always a there's a controversy about God and man. Religious spirits don't like to talk about God being in men. &gt;&gt; Amen. They'll talk about Calvary only as a place of forgiveness, but they don't want to talk about what it should achieve. Why did he go up Calvary? to take your sins far away. Why did he do that? To cleanse you. Why did he cleanse you? So he can fill you. That he can walk in you. That all he is can be poured into you. That's why he died on Calvary. It's more than just a forgiveness. So the forgiveness is great. I knew I know what it's like to be forgiven. But it's not just now you're forgiven and go go away in the same state you came in. No, he wants to transform us in such a way that the way we come is not the way we go. Amen. We're a totally different person. A new creation. Not a patched up job. Not a reformed people. No. But a transformed people. Amen. Made in his image. A totally new person. Old things have passed away. All things become new. Hallelujah. This is what he wants to do. And I believe this is what he has done. Now, but you see, there's always this controversy. People don't like to talk about God being in a people. I'm just here to just to clear this out completely &gt;&gt; cuz the devil doesn't care how much you talk about God. &gt;&gt; He just doesn't want to see God to live. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you can testify all that. People are not worried about talking about God 50 years ago. I'm not living 50 years ago. I wasn't even a thought in my parents' mind 50 years ago. I just hit 40 this year. I wasn't around. That wasn't my revival. Now is my revival. Now is my time to see God live. I'm not I'm not a history is interesting, but I'm not a biblical historian. Oh, back 2,000 years ago. If he's not the same God today, let's just go home. But if he is the same today, I think we should give our all and just push in like never before. Amen. Cuz we realize that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now, Brother Bram says in the seat, he's not air with the shook. But she said, "But when you come to say, I and my father are one." This is what Calvary came to achieve that you and the father would become one &gt;&gt; and other things. Then the shuck pulls away from it. The shuck doesn't doesn't like that kind of talk. How dare you say you and God are one. Well, that's what that that that's why he died. That's what Christianity is to be Christlike. Right? The only way to be Christlike is if Christ is in you. Otherwise, the Apostle Paul was preaching error by saying, "Christ, Christ in you, the hope of glory." I believe the doctrine of the Apostle Paul. Brother did too. We're being restored back to it. So, I think we should say what Paul says, not some Baptist theology that doesn't change anyone. We should actually talk about what the Apostle Paul said, that God can transform you. He can change you. That faith can come in and things drop off your life. That he gives you victory. You don't just talk about victory. You're a living victory. The things that's once held me down are not even holding me down anymore. They're not even a thought in my mind. They don't bother me no more. And if they bother me, it's just a memory that's bothering me. And you got to put that in its place and say, "No, I've been liberated. &gt;&gt; I'm free. I'm walking in newness of life. I'm not walking in the oldness of my dead life. I'm newness of a new life. I'm walking in it." How did you get there? He put me in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength. For he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. So, so this is this is you and I. The genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and its strength. The strength of this word is not weak. &gt;&gt; We don't serve a weak God. We don't serve some kind of a wimpy God. We serve the all powerful, allconquering, almighty, fearless God. He wasn't afraid to go to hell for you. He wasn't afraid to take the keys of hell, death, and the grave off Satan. He wasn't afraid to look a religious spirit in the eye and say, "You bunch of wited walls." I mean, he wasn't afraid to stand on the promises of God, he wasn't ashamed. And when that same God comes into you, it makes you unashamed. Amen. And when people come to you and try and say, "This message isn't true and it doesn't work and it's false doctrine," I say, "Hold on. It said I would meet God. I met God. It said I'd receive an upper room experience. I've done that. It said I'd go from glory to glory. It's done that. It said that it would actually make me one with the word himself. It's done that. Amen. So if someone comes along and says, "No, it doesn't work." They say, "You've come far too late." And I say, "Well, what's it what is your religion done for you?" &gt;&gt; This is what this has done for me. Years ago, we had people say, you know, leave the church and all these things. I said, "Well, but we see the love of God among the people." Yes. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Christianity should be? By this shall all men know you are my disciples cuz you have love one for another. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just because we all just got along like some big happy group. No, it's cuz the love of God was binding us together. So if that's the achievement of the message, what's the problem? &gt;&gt; But the problem is a religious spirit tries to come in and make us lukewarm, formal, and powerless. And I'm not interested in it being a lukewarm, formal, and powerless. I'm interested in receiving all that God has poured into me to be lived out of me. That's what I want. That's what I live for. I just want to see him live. &gt;&gt; So why should you know? So, so never let something come along and say and reduce this message to an argument. This message is not an argument. It is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's far more. Amen. It's far more than just an argument. Now, the Lord would say, I am the true vine and my father is a husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, uh, he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you, abide in me, and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, and no uh no more can ye except ye abide in me. I am the vine, and ye are the branches. Amen. So the branches bear the fruit, the branches bear the life. Amen. It's not the vine. The vine just sends its life into the branch and the branch produces the life. So, and if you look at a vine and a branch, you know, where's the connection? Where does the branch begin and you know the vine stop? It's one whole unit. There's been an atonement, you could say, taken place. They are one. So, all that's in the vine comes into the branch and produces a fruit. So, all that was in Christ was poured into you, right? the life because what he is the strength of our life. Amen. Brother Bram says now he don't have no hands tonight but my hands and your hands. He has eyes and mine and yours. That's what he's using. He is the vine. We are the branches. Is that right, brethren? And the vine doesn't bear fruit. The branch bears fruit energized by the vine. Is that right? And if the first branch that came out of that Pentecostal vine wrote a book of Acts, if that tree ever puts forth another branch, it'll write another book of Acts cuz it won't put forth a pumpkin. Amen. And then a watermelon, then a pomegranate, it'll bring forth the same fruit every time cuz it's the same life going through the vine. He says, "Now, do you understand?" So if it's that same life, it's not going to produce a dead formal group that argues and fusses and fights. That's a pumpkin. We ain't pumpkin fruit bearing believers. We bear the fruit of the vine. Amen. Which is joy, love, peace, gentleness, faith, being longsuffering. All the fruits of the spirit, they are produced. Amen. What was the book of Acts? The book of Acts was God demonstrating himself in a body. More than healing, more than prophecy, it was God. That was just fruit manifested out of the life that was within them. Amen. And so, if God ever puts forth another branch, he'll write another book of Acts. And you got to realize, so what am I? I'm a branch of God. God put me forth out of the vine. It wasn't me trying to grow myself in. I wasn't grafted in to produce my own fruit. Amen. No, it was him grew me out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [snorts] Amen. So therefore, if it's the life of the vine that's producing the fruit, Amen. then, because you know, like Jesus says, by their fruit you shall know them. &gt;&gt; It's not by their talk or by their argument. It's by their fruit. What life do they live? What's their track record? I trust we can see a track record behind us of Christianity. A real a real Christian life. Amen. Says, "Likewise, the Spirit although also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searchth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercessions for the saints according to the will of God." So there's this energizing from the the life in the vine. Amen. Which bears which which which can speak through you, can intercede through you. Why? Because it's him within you praying. It's him within you interceding. It's him within you groaning, giving you a longing. It's not your it's not your desire. It becomes his desire if you're become one with him. Right? It's not your motivation, your human ability. It's him leading, guiding you, praying through you. You you you receive a burden for someone who put that there. That was him. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's within you. He wants to manifest himself out of you. Amen. Because we're being made to intercede to stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; That's part of him. Didn't he stand in the gap for you and I? &gt;&gt; Right? And if he's in you, won't you do the same thing? &gt;&gt; Cuz he is in you, right? Didn't he love his enemies? Forgive his enemies? If he's in you, you'll do the same thing. You can't help it because it's him in you doing it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. We all understand. All that he is is in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm just a believer. No, don't don't don't just make that something like I just come to church and that's all I do. No. If you're a real believer, he's in you. &gt;&gt; You're part of his body. &gt;&gt; You're part of the body of Christ. Amen. So, all that he is is in you to be manifested. Now, some people will say, "Well, does that mean you just humanly go around and do what you want to do?" No, we're not a bunch of superheroes that wear our undies on the outside, running around at night and trying to save the day using our power because what what do they do? We know it's just a perversion, but they their human will will govern the powers that they have, &gt;&gt; right? It doesn't work that way with a believer. &gt;&gt; We don't use the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost uses us. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like, I need to get the Holy Ghost. No, you just got to let the Holy Ghost get you. &gt;&gt; Stop stop pushing and pulling up and down and fussing and stressing. No, just let the Holy Ghost get you. Make a full surrender. That's and then and then what happens? He you become under his control and then now he can use you. Right? So if he wants you to speak to someone, that's him doing it. &gt;&gt; It's not you saying, "Well, I've got well all power of heaven and earth is in me because he's in me. Therefore, I can do what I want and humanly I can just dispense whatever." No, it's God living through you. Remember because like I said on Wednesday, the spirit is the sixth sense. God gave man five senses. They wasn't to control you. They're to contact your earthly home. But the sixth sense, which is faith, it leads you. It controls you. Amen. Because what happens is he comes onto the throne of your heart. He rules. So it's now his faith leading you. Like the apostle Paul would say, it's no longer I that liveth, but Christ that liveth in me. And the life I now live, I live by the faith of the son of God. &gt;&gt; Right? So now it's actually him controlling you and I because he's the intelligence. We're the body, &gt;&gt; right? So what he wants to do is lived out through you and I. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this, you know, is this really the case? I thought, you know, because many people, I'm not saying here, they'll just take it like there's like God in his church or God in the believer. No, they're like this. This is atonement. So when the apostle Paul was, you say, well, what does Jesus say about this? I'm glad you asked that question. Okay. So, here is the Apostle Paul. He's on the road to Damascus, you know, and and in his in his heart, he's going to destroy all the Christians there. And Jesus, when he appeared to the Apostle Paul, the Apostle Paul fell down on the earth, and he heard a voice saying unto him, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" He didn't say, "Why are you persecuting my believers?" Or, "Why are you persecuting my church?" He says, "Why are you persecuting me?" Amen. Brother Brham made the statement, "She is him." Right? She is him. Okay? That's a scriptural that's a scriptural quote cuz it's this right. So God did not say why are you persecuting them? Why are you persecuting me? Because why? Cuz God had given them the atonement. They had become one with God. That when Paul was handling the church, he was handling Christ. &gt;&gt; He was handling the believer. He's handling God in flesh when he took them to prison. And I say we got to be very careful how we handle one another. I mean, we got to have spiritual discernment to look beyond the veil and see the word in flesh. Amen. How we treat one another. The side comments and gossip. Those things, those things should not even be spoken among us. It should be good things spoken. It should be respectful things, kind things. Amen. Thoughtful things, not degrading things. We should be building each other up. Amen. Not just that, we should not be tearing one another down. And if you do that, if you're just all that that brother, this sister, I say, "Hold on. Maybe maybe take the glasses off &gt;&gt; and actually say, "Lord, reveal to me who they really are &gt;&gt; beyond their humanity." &gt;&gt; And I think you might get a voice like this saying, "Why are you persecuting me? Why are you rubbishing that person? Why you rubbishing me?" And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And and the Lord said, "I am Jesus whom thou persecuteth." So if you touch, you're like brother Aaron makes a statement. He says if the devil goes after any of God's children, he's got Jesus Christ on his hands &gt;&gt; cuz Jesus Christ is within them. Amen. So, so God would say, "You're persecuting me, Saul, because you're touching my body." It's like if you cut my fingers off or try to, you're harming me cuz they're part of me. You can't divide, you can't remove my finger, it's part of me, right? And so, it's the same thing with you and I. We are part of the body of Christ. We are his body. Amen. And all that he is is now poured into you and I. And as he being the groom, the bride has come forth because it's part of him. And it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations as as others has spoken of the bride. It can only manifest if it does something different from the groom, it isn't the bride. Amen. So if it's something different from the word, it's not the bride. Amen. Because she is the flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him. As man and woman are one and woman taken from the um from his side, she has taken a spirit, the feminist spirit from him, the flesh of his flesh, both made both mechanics and dynamics, the wife, the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put together as made both mechanics and dynamics. So it's not just the word, it is the anoint as the Holy Ghost on the word to make it live. Brother Bram said, "I'm not so interested so much in the mechanics. I want to see the dynamics of it. I want to see it live." So both of these things are in you and I. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, so until the church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did, if he hit on 16 cylinders, so will the bride. Amen. For he said in John 14:12, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. I'll give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it. I'll raise him up again at the last day. That's the Easter message. The dynamics and the mechanics together. The mechanics without the dynamics is no good. Neither is the dynamics without the mechanics. Amen. So, it's the spirit and the word coming together. And where is that coming together? In his body. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, all that he is is there. Now, God loves to God loves to display his attributes. And the only way he can display his attributes is when he becomes flesh. &gt;&gt; Like he says he you know he says that he loved fatherhood. God loves fatherhood for he was a father but the only way he could express it was to become a son a man. So his his his attributes can only be manifested really when it's put in flesh. So now this is why he uses his body because he wants all that he is is to be poured through you and I. Okay? So it's the same thing. Now if c if god is in you then mercy is in you. &gt;&gt; Okay. In the old testament there was the there was a tabernacle in the wilderness right there was the three rooms of it. In the inside is the holy of holies. The ark of the covenant with the blood is the mercy seat. Right? And mercy comes from that seat. Okay? Now that is actually representing the human body. We all know this, right? So now if the blood has been applied to that throne, right? And then what's under the mercy seat? It's the word. Amen. There's the there's the pot of mana and there's and there's Aaron's rod are in that room. Okay. So now what is it? There's a evidence of a life coming forth. Aaron's rod budding into almonds, right? There's mana. There's that word that never gets old within your soul. I mean, it's always fresh and wonderful. Tastes sweet. I mean, that's why I'm a sweet tooth. I believe. If you're savory, that's fine. But I like being sweet tooth. You see? And then what is there? There's the word. There's the law. But it's under the blood, under the mercy seat. I mean, so therefore, what are you being governed by? Not by that two tablets of stone of thou shalt, thou shalt not. We're not governed by that, friends. We're governed by the atoning blood on the mercy seat. I mean, why? Because the blood is applied to you. That life of God comes into you. And then what happens now is all that's in that ark now can be actually expressed through your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. That's why you speak to a real believer, so it's just like mana comes forth. &gt;&gt; The why? Because the word is alive to them. It's not stale. It's not rotting. It's not having to be preserved or put in the freezer to make it live a bit longer. No, it's alive. Amen. That's why it's so important where you you know that mana pot's fresh because the word still has meaning. It's still got power. It's still sweet. Amen. There's a goodness of God that flows out of someone's life. Amen. It's not some bitter thing. And oh yes, but you know there's no butt. So actually the only butt is but God rich in mercy. Amen. He can do it all. Amen. And hallelujah. But I like that. That was just fresh. But you see he said then there was the blood on the mercy seat. So it wasn't a judgment seat. You take someone who's always judgmental. Believer or not believer. I tell you what, they just need some blood put on that seat. So it's not a judgmental attitude and things coming out and trying to, you know, just you just tear and criticize everything down. No. Mercy can be dispensed. Amen. Because we got to understand that the mercy seat is not a piece of furniture. The shadow was, but it was pointing to a reality, &gt;&gt; right? Just like the seven golden candlesticks, that was a shadow pointing to a reality. The brazen altar, all those pieces of furniture, it's just a shadow. And why why would you know it's amazing how you know the Jews, they're looking for a red heer for waters of separation according to the scripture. You know, brother Bram says that real red heer is Christ. The waters of separation is the revealed word. But they're looking for shadows. I'm not looking for shadows. I'm looking for the real. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want the reality. If they found the ark of the covenant, that would all be very exciting. But it's just a shadow. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's pointing to you and I. &gt;&gt; Where God can be living, walking, talking through a people where his mercy, his love, his grace, his forgiveness can be manifested through you. Because as I said, the mercy seat back there or the ark of the covenant back there is just a shadow. Brother Ram says the real the real mercy seat was hanging on Calvary. The real one cuz the mercy seat is a person, right? He is he is a God rich in mercy. Amen. He is still on he is still interceding in the heavens, &gt;&gt; right? He's still actively working on your behalf, working for his bo, interceding for his body upon the earth. Amen. And that's why the blood is still here. Amen. Mercy is still here. But where is God going to manifest that mercy through through you and I? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how could that be if he's there and here?" Well, he said to Nicodemus, you know, no man's ascended to heaven but the son of man which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; And he was standing on the earth talking to Nicodemus. I'm not trying to confuse you a bit, but he's basically saying, I'm here and I'm there. Yes, &gt;&gt; God can be in more than one place. His corporal body's up there. &gt;&gt; We're going to meet him in the air. We're physically going to meet the Lord in the air. That's what believers believe. That's what the prophet taught, right? So, we're going to But where where is that mercy? Cuz all that he was, do you believe he's the fountain of mercy? Do you believe he has grace and truth? Do you believe he is has the power to forgive? Amen. To to atone, to reconcile. That ministry of reconciliation is in you and I. The scripture says if he is in you all those attributes can come out of you. &gt;&gt; If you got a religious spirit they won't. But if you have the spirit of Christ you got to realize actually mercy can be dispensed through me. Well well how can that be dispensed? Through prayer through a through a w you know through God speaking through your lips. You know someone can be bound up in their mind and then you walk by. Mercy flows. They become unbound. They get liberated. You know, someone can think maybe they've crossed the line, you know, cuz the devil's got them in a lie. They haven't crossed the line. If you got a hunger for God, you haven't crossed no line, right? But then they can be bound in that. Then what happens? You sit next to them. You begin to speak about the goodness of God. And and if you got a hunger, that means you haven't crossed the line. And what does that do? That's mercy coming to them. I mean, someone's lost. They're hungry for God. You can tell them your testimony of a God that lives. You can show how your candle got lit. What is that? That's mercy coming to them. That's not some scary thing. &gt;&gt; I know. I know you don't think it's scary, but I just want to like I just want you to realize what's in me. We don't have some dormant God living in us. He's not some dormant statue that just lives in our soul. He's living. He's speaking. He's working. He's expressing himself. He's revealing himself. He wants to grow in your life. He wants to live through your life. He's not a dormant thing. Amen. So, the real genuine lamb of God was hanging in plain view on Calvary, the real mercy seat. Oh, well, what about when he leaves the mercy seat in heaven? Well, it's because that's when the last name in the book is dipped in the blood and then he changes his garments cuz you're not going to meet your wife when you're covered in blood. I put it that way. You're going to change your garments, right? You're going to be dressed up. Then he's going to meet us in the air. You say, "Well, does that mean there's no more blood for anyone else?" Absolutely not. Because there's still mercy for the Jews. There's always going to be mercy because he is mercy. He is his attributes, right? Are we all together? &gt;&gt; You think, well, that he is mercy. So if he's in you, you'll be merciful. The biatitudes are more than just a nice thing. He sat down and he's expressing the characteristic of him in a people. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Well, that's the attribute of God, that mercy coming up. Blessed are the meek, you know, blessed are they hunger and thirst, they shall be filled. He's actually expressing this is what a Christian should be. He's painting a picture of a character that he's going to form in a people. Listen, as the father sent me, so do I send you. He didn't only send you. He goes with you. I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world. All that was in God was poured out into Christ. And all that was in Christ was emptied out into the belief of the church. God is with you. Lo, I'm with you always, even to the end of the world. That's a declaration of God's word. That's what the Bible says. That's what I believe. I just colored in the title, proof of of his resurrection, &gt;&gt; cuz he's proving now this is actually the proof of his resurrection is God living through a people. Amen. I believe it. So therefore, now if if God has seven compound names, they're in you. If Jesus is in you, I'm just I I'm just kind of repeating. I I just want this to sink in. Let's just kind of, you know, let's just roast this for a little bit. Let's cook it a little bit. Okay. I want this to be seasoned, right? I just want So So now he is what is he? He is Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide himself a sacrifice. Amen. That means that attribute is in you. If Jesus is in you, right? I am Jehovah Rafa. The Lord is our healer. &gt;&gt; Right? Where does healing come through? Through his body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cornelius was praying in his house. Acts chapter 10. An angel comes to Cornelius. He says, "Your prayers and arms have come before God." He doesn't say, "No, I'm going to tell you the gospel and I'm going I'm going to tell you what God has done in your day." He says, "Actually, go get part of God's body. Go get Peter." He's in Japa because m because God's word manifests through his body. &gt;&gt; Right? So Peter came. We know the story, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. You say, "Well, God doesn't use his body." He does use his body. He wants to use you. Don't let the devil try and put some blockage in your mind thinking, "Well, God can use maybe the pastor or the deacons or someone. He can't use me." He can use all of us. &gt;&gt; If God is in you, he can use you. &gt;&gt; Whatever attribute he wants to display through your life, he can display it. Amen. He is He is Jehovani, the buckler, the shield of peace. He's Jehovah Shalom. You ever come, you ever been troubled and you're talking to a believer? Peace just comes. Where'd that peace come from? From one to the other. All these all these names, redemptive names gathered up in one lovely big name, Jesus Christ. And in their rest all the fulfilling of the compound redemptive names of Jehovah. So all his attributes are in you. His church is not a bunch of people who argue doctrine. This just stood out to me. I was listening to this. He says, "Now, if I take if I take the Presbyterian doctrine and you Pentecostals till you don't know and tie you Pentecostals till you don't know, I can take the Baptist doctrine and show you Pentecostals a million things you know nothing of." That's right. But that's not it. Amen. That's not his church. That's not his church. His church is himself revealed. Amen. So if you have someone who's arguing doctrine and fussing and fighting is the message right and wrong and this is right and wrong. That's not his body. That's just people arguing. You with me? This is not that that that is not even close to what it is. &gt;&gt; What it is is himself revealed &gt;&gt; through a people his word putting on flesh that you become a living epistle read known of all men. Amen. That everything they read about Jesus and and the Holy Ghost doing in the Bible they see it in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what the church is. It's himself being made known to the world. Amen. Do you see it expressed by the word itself that he is God? Amen. This is this is what his church is. Transcends argument, transcends all these things. No, it's that God all that he is can be is poured into you that he can pour himself out to this world. Amen. He is the thing. He was the prophets. I'm going to I'm going to wind this up. Um he was the prophets. He was in them. He was in the Psalms. He was the history. He's the things to come. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Hebrews 13:8. If you're writing it down, he should be then he should be the principle. Uh that is what he is and we believe it, don't we? Then if he is that, then he should be the principal theme of our talking. He should be the principal theme of our thinking, of our singing, of our walks. Amen. He should be the principal theme of our life. Amen. If he is the principal theme of the Bible, and the Bible's in us, then it should be the principal theme of everything we say, do, or think should be Christ. If he's the king in our lives, &gt;&gt; if we are his body, it's his thinking coming through us, then all that we should do is actually he should be the principal theme of our lives. You realize that we actually have an incredible high and holy calling that God could display himself to the world through you and I. What kind of people ought we to be? You say, "Well, I have my humanity." Let's go beyond that for a second. What kind of attitude should we be carrying? Is she an attitude of Lord your mercy so great Lord I want Lord you want to use me as a pipe as a channel to this world here I am Lord whatever you want me to do Lord Lord may I have a loving kind thoughtful attitude towards everybody amen may I have a good me and even against your enemies you should have a good attitude &gt;&gt; oh but they they're so cruel and mean and they say all these things it should be actually father forgive them they don't know what they do we anyone who wants to see someone lost or have a terrible life, they have they have actually got a wrong mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Actually, if you have the mind of Christ, you should want to see good in everyone. See everyone prosper, everyone do well, everyone find the Lord, everyone be there on the other side, that should be our heart, &gt;&gt; right? So, if he is within us now and he can dispense mercy, grace, healing, peace, the Holy Ghost can get a hold of someone through our life, what kind of people should we be? what kind of attitude you'll be carrying around. Not a selfish attitude and what I can get and me and fussing and fighting and what's not convenient. I'm not going to do it. We shouldn't have a selfish bone in our bodies. He didn't. And we're his body. Amen. Now, I'm just going to maybe let's have the musicians this morning and we're just going to finish. Brother Ram says this, and to me this is more than a quote. He says, "If I told you if I was John Dillinger or the spirit of John Dillinger was on me, you would look me to have guns and act like John Dillinger. But if I told you I was an artist and the spirit of a great artist was on me, you'd expect me to paint pictures of an artist. Is that right? If I told you I was an expert mechanic and the mechanic spirit was on me, you'd expect me to know what was wrong with your car. If I tell you that I was born of the spirit of God and the spirit of Jesus Christ was on me, you'd expect me to do what he did, act like he did. That's his spirit working through a human being. Do you believe that? His spirit working on a uh worked on a brass serpent one time. Do you believe that? And and on the pool of Bethesda uh uh water chopped up, troubled water ever who stepped in there believing they received their healing. Is that right? Could the water say, "Look what a great water I am." No. It was the angel on the water that done the healing. Not the water, the angel. When the angel went away, it was just water. Men are just men, but it's God's agency. God doesn't fall upon denominations. God doesn't fall upon mechanical devices. God, the Holy Spirit fell upon men. Man is God's agent. And the hardest thing that God has ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another. &gt;&gt; So, you are God's agency. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he is in you, all that all that was in Christ is now poured into you. Then God can use you as an agency to manifest all of his nature, all of his character, all of his attributes to this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in you, the hope of glory. We have an we are blessed people &gt;&gt; to have God deity is not just in heaven. It's in you. &gt;&gt; And God wants to manifest all that he is through your life. Amen. Let's stand, shall we? This morning. Amen. I just want to sing. Let's sing something happy. Eh, let's sing um I have a reason to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a reason to praise you.
