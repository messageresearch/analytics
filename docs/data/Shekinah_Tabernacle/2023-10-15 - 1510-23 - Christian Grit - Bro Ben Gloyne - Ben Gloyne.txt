========================================

[Music] yeah [Music] [Music] good morning how are you you um are believers this morning the principle of the word of God is the Lord said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and the mercy of God is that we would understand what the truth is because if you don't know what the truth is then how can you go in any sort of direction towards the truth so the the first uh mercy of God is to let us know what the truth is that then enables us to say well then that's what I want and then faith can then take a hold and walk in the direction of that truth walk in it but we have to walk in it see footsteps are possession you could know the truth and stand here and never walk in it and the truth could be anything to make you free like you could be going down uh a a road and living in adultery or something like that as an extreme case but until you get told the truth that it's wrong you'll always walk that way but when the Lord shows you it's wrong you think well what's right oh this is right then I can walk that way but remember in every single thing in the word of God footsteps are possession so so if you want anything at all in the scriptures any promise of God is yours and once you see it it's yours to to possess it's yours to possess the only thing stopping you from possessing it is you me we don't go that's the only thing that ever stops us attaining to any promise in the word of God is that we don't just walk forward into it that's that's the only thing and Satan's whole Ploy is to tell you don't take that step that's his whole scheme cuz he knows the moment you do that's it you're getting it and you have he knows we have the ability to walk forward into every promise of the word of God God and and so that means we are believers because we believe his word and then we're also soldiers because we just move forward and everything everything any promise of the word of God don't don't have any fear just walk forward into it and and if we walk forward we possess it the minute we walk forward we possess it don't don't matter what the devil tells you or trying to push you back you just walk forward and possess it every promise in the word of God so if there's anything in your life that even the devil might said you you can never have that that's an absolute lie you can have everything all things according to the word of God are ours and and we've been given a word that has shown us what we what we possess so we just walk in it and that's how we just get Victory after Victory hey sometimes the battle gets hot and heavy cuz there's an enemy that wants to stop us from getting it but we just press on cuz we win every battle amen let's um stand this morning and just invite the Lord here Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be in the company of believers Lord and we want to just have our faith enriched this morning Lord we know that our faith has to be tried but we just want to be refreshed by your spirit this morning Lord that that that we could just be energized Lord to keep pressing on the good fight of Faith Lord and to possess every promise that you have that that you've shown to us Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord for your great Mercy For Your Grace Lord may may we never listen to any lies of the enemy Lord that would tell us that we can't have a certain thing Lord that that may that's too hard for you to get no it's been too long you you'll never get that all of these things are just lies from Satan and we want to rebuke those lies Lord and just accept your truth Lord that we will know the truth and the truth will set us free Lord Lord and that we can possess all things Lord there's a song that says we are able to go up and take the country you've given us you've given us the land lord and we want to walk forward and possess it by faith so we just pray you'd bless our service this morning Lord may we have a a good time in you may you refresh each one of us with the Holy Ghost Lord Lord that that that we could just be enriched in our spirit this morning Lord because we know that in you is all strength Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength Lord so we wait upon you this morning we just wait in your presence Lord and we know that our strength will be renewed when we walk out of this place this morning bless the word may it speak to our hearts Lord may we accept it as being from you that we could receive it the way that it that we should receive it when we when we look beyond the man and and think God is in this place and he's speaking directly to us the

I voted for but you know Christine puts on a certain color I'm like how can I match you so here I am so you know um I vote yeah I voted yesterday if you voted good you can can complain but you know there's that one vote you got to really cast The Devil voted against you Jesus voted for you whoever where you put your vote is where you're going to go so I voted that vote and that vote stands amen there's not a change every three or whatever years so praise God Amen who's happy today hallelujah amen we can rejoice in in any circumstance so amen amen let's um let's read here 2 Kings 6:15 to1 17 then we're going to go to Hebrews uh 12 make sure I've got all my notes there amen so 2 Kings 65-1 17 and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth Behold a host encamped uh the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him this is this is the servant of Elisha speaking to him now uh atas my master what shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elishah prayed and said Lord I pray thee open this man's um open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha amen then we're just going to read from Hebrews 12 very familiar uh scriptures here as well um amen it says wherefore seeing we also comp passed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that is set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer you want be room in prayer you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen let's talk to him together amen gracious father we're so thankful we can approach your great throne of grace this morning because of your blood we come Lord Jesus and you called us to come so here we are Lord we are so thankful we can stand in your presence once again and bow our heads in our hearts and give you thanks for another day we thank you for life in our bodies we thank you for an unfailing faith in our hearts that you put us put there Lord and We Want To Praise Your Great Name today we're asking Lord that you'd come Among Us One More Time touch every heart from the oldest to the youngest touch those who may be watching as well by the way of YouTube dear God and Father may you move in great power Lord r great expectation Lord knowing that campers next weekend father all the things that you are going to do there and I believe you're going to do great things here as well so may you just take the service Under Your Divine control Lord we know you're in control of all things Lord and father you're more than able to do anything Lord so father have your way for your glory Lord we love you we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may have your seats want to welcome also uh tonyan and the children as well God bless you great to have you with us amen this morning amen so I want to speak about Christian grit I was talking to I think a couple of weeks ago I said to Christine I want to talk about grit am me so here we are so it's basically a part two of a couple of Sundays ago where I speaking about don't don't uh don't pull back but press forward mean because we're living in an incredible time you know this is such a great this is the greatest age to be alive in amen this is the best time to be alive this is even better than being here in the when Jesus was in the days of his flesh that wouldn't have made that would have been a great day but this is a better day amen because we're going to see the in Christ raised amen our bodies are going to be changed and we're going to be with them caught up to meet the Lord in the air amen so I'm so thankful that we're not waiting for a you know we don't have to wait 2,000 years you know it would be great to be waiting in Paradise sure but isn't it amazing we can be a people who don't taste death necessarily and even if we do taste death well we can't lose amen because amen because we're going to get there anyway right so doesn't matter what happens to this Natural Body amen if there's that if God has has birthed your soul into his Kingdom you're in a good condition amen so a grit you know grit um this is from Psychology today not that we're preaching psychology but I just got this grit is a construct that is said to summon both passion and perseverance in service of a long-term goal it's a marathon not a Sprint as they say in other words gritty people put in sustained effort over time to achieve a high level of of success in their chosen domain now this is just naturally speaking but you know so how much more you know people can can can give their whole lives over to a goal you know Elon Musk wants to go to Mars other people want to go to the moon and you know their whole lives have just been focused on that one goal that's all they're that's all they're interested in am mean but so so if people can do that naturally how much more Supernatural people amen who are who are here that God can anoint them that he can live his word through them amen that they can be the final voice to the final age I mean how much more people that are made in His image washed in his blood you see it's one thing to say Lord you know like the blind man who was born blind it was one thing to say yes I'm that blind man but then when Jesus touched him amen and eyes came open he didn't speak the same way he spoke before Jesus touched him I mean he spoke a different kind of a language he had a different kind of a walk he had a different kind of experience because the master found him and touched him amen and he said this is all I know I was blind but now I see I was once blind but I'm not blind anymore maybe people would say oh you're that blind man the gate he'd say no I'm not that blind man I was that blind man but now I'm a seeing man I mean I can see the supernatural I can see the power of God I can see God in his word in this day I just made a Quantum Leap from that man to you amen but you know we're going to realize that you know God has built us to overcome in this day am mean God has made us with a grit this is I'm not talking about human grit I'm not talking about a you a force of a will you know of just a human ambition this is far greater than that amen but we've been built Amen to have a passion and a perseverance Amen in a marathon amen we are we are long-distance Runners amen we are built to be longdistance Runners amen with this race praise God that's right Hallelujah because we got to realize that we're living in a day where where where dimensions are merging together that's right am mean you see hell upon the Earth it's very evident we can say that demon power has been released in this day we can see that there's no stretch to the imagination but you know brother Brown would say that as as hell has turned loose upon the Earth all of Heaven is turn loose also amen so there's a merging of Dimensions going on right now amen in this day and so hell's upon the Earth but Heaven here also amen so we're not here amen by ourselves trying to get by just trying to scrape through lady OA no we're built to overcome God has made us to overcome he's made you that way we're going to you got to realize you're a champion this morning because the champion of champions came down from glory and he conquered hell death in the grave for you and that Spirit of victory that was in him with the AP ISM of the Holy Ghost comes into you and you become an overcomer amen so we are champions today cuz he's made us a champion remember he caus us always to Triumph in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen if I speak too fast get too excited well just come with me you know we have a living God Amen he's alive amen hallelujah we don't serve a tradition we don't serve a nice idea we serve the true and living God I'm not trying to pump you up or make you excited we just got to let God Quicken to us the reality of who he is and who we are in him amen because if we look at the natural things like the servant of of of Elisha we'll get perplexed we'll be troubled amen the enemy's here to get us we're in trouble you know they were stuck in that City they could not get out he was he was all concerned what are we going to do now and then so the prophet he prayed Open Lord open the young man's eyes now his prayer did not bring the Angels down amen his prayer did not his prayer didn't bring the angel down the armies of Heaven were already there am mean before before the syrians turned up the armies were there I mean before the young men went out and started to panic the Army was there I mean before the prophet prayed the armies of Heaven were already there but just took the opening of the eyes Amen to show what the reality of the situation see many times we just see the enemy around about we see troubles and and depression and problems and anxiety and economic problems and all these different things but our eyes need to come open to the re that's not the reality of the situation amen our God is Jehovah Gyra amen he will provide he has provided amen amen he is Jehovah Shalom he is our peace amen he's a peace that passs all understanding he's Jehovah Rafa he's our healer he's our Banner he's our buckler he's our Shield I mean and the reason he is those things is because he is Jehovah shamama which means the Lord is present amen if he is present all of his attributes are present amen so if all of us attribute to present amen it's because then we can tap into them amen if you're just scratching the top two inches of your scale trying to find the solution amen that's as far as you'll go but if you can realize you can tap into the mind of God I mean you can seek God In Prayer say Lord I need the answer to this amen you can be persevering and pursue God am me for his answer amen then it'll go beyond your top two inches and you'll get God's mind in the situation Hallelujah so so he prayed and then see God opened this boy's eyes and when his eyes come open the mountains was on fire and angels are fire chars of fire sure he's here amen now and he says and when Christian Believers can believe that present now right now sitting together seated here in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus fellowshipping amen around the word of God the Holy Spirit here taking the word by Vision word of God by Vision moving it out into every heart like that as the word is going forth and every believer receiving it oh if we could stand and claim our god-given privileges that's the time that God can take can ever take that Wishbone out of a person's back and put a real old-fashioned gospel backbone into him somebody he'll stand for truth no matter how dark it looks amen so if you want your Wishbone to be replaced by a gospel backbone amen just stand up and claim your god-given privileges am me because if you realize that every promise of God is yours it's been given to you remember the devil didn't give it so he can't keep it the devil didn't give it so he can't keep it God gave it and he and he wants you to receive it am mean so instead of taking a wishbone of I wish God would do something and I wish he could do this and I wish he could do that in order to get rid of that and a real backbone that God's word is true and I'm going to stand on his promise claim your god-given privilege if you got a jellyfish kind of a Christianity and you want a real backbone just take your god-given privilege amen amen that's what brother B saying here amen if you want to get rid of a wishbone and get a backbone claim your god-given privileges right now amen or maybe one day no no now today's the day of salvation today's the day of healing today's the days of Deliverance amen you say it's impossible nothing's impossible with God nothing's impossible he made the body you live in he made this building amen he made this planet he made the solar system he made the universe he made everything what's your problem compared to that amen God can do it amen nothing can defeat Our God Amen our God is he cannot be conquered and he cannot liej and if he said it he can do it amen so we got to have a real grit to say yes Lord I believe your word I'm not going to sit back and let the devil Bluff me out of any promise I'm not going to sit here in the stale made of a you know Israel got to a point that we're going to dismantle Hummer people say it can't be done if theyve got enough grit they'll do it that's if they've got enough grit and determination they will dismantle that thing but they've got to have determination to do it they got to have a vision amen if you got a vision you can do it amen you got to have a vision of the word living in your life amen you got have a vision of angels visiting your home you have a vision of your children receiving the Holy Ghost you have a vision of healing you got to have a vision of those things and if you and let your life Focus onto that vision and God will manifest that Vision see Caleb got a vision of his Mountain he says that's my mountain that's my promise that's my inheritance and he went and got it the other spies only had a vision of the enemy but Caleb had a vision of the promise amen just like Joshua so if we have a vision of the promise God can give us that promise amen let's not look at the problems our God is bigger than the problems our God is bigger than our complex he's bigger than our natural traits he's bigger than our human DNA he's greater than those things so let's not look at those things amen I read an article the other day where you know people you talking about problems in people's Spirits just on a psychological level and they were raising the question have we opened a box where people diagnose themselves with things they don't really have cuz you know I was talking to someone on the phone the other day and they said they don't diagnose their um um medical problems by Google because you Google can turn a a cough into a cancer right you know it could be a ter Google can say you're terminal but really you just got a rash you know so so but but psychologically people are raising questions how we open this box too much that people diagnose well I've got this personality disorder I've got this problem and people focus on their problems are not the solution amen who cares honestly sure you know if it gives you peace they say l there should be one label we have redeemed saved Sanctified May Mrs Jesus Christ amen that should be the label of your life if you want a if you want a diagnosis of you it should be saved clean amen a new creature not this person they disorder or this or this or this God will deal with those things but you got to identify yourself in the scripture as part of him when you identify yourself in the scripture as part of him then God will take that Faith quick in that word and make it live in your life amen you can see that's why people when they go get baptized they believe Jesus saved them so they act upon it right amen you believe you Jesus healed you you get anointed you get prayer whatever more but you believe he's done it so you act upon the faith that he's done it amen so we've got to act upon the faith that God has taking care of me that whatever I may have in hear it from my natural lineage that's going to be done away with and it's not the focus of my life amen just as Jonah would say those that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy on Amen so we don't want to be observing lying vanities amen doesn't matter how real it may be how much you feel it how much you imagine it if it's contrary to the word of God it's a lying vanity am huah yes sir hallelujah amen so let's have a good oldfashioned gospel backbone I believe I'm preaching to the choir right but let's have a real grit we can fully dismantle the devil's work we can fully dismantle Hamas in the spiritual amen I mean we don't have to have a peace treaty we don't have just to try and feed some off some part in our life we can dismantle them am mean we have the fire power Hallelujah we have air superiority amen we have the intelligence amen we got all the weapons to fully dismantle the devil in our lives amen but it takes a real grit and what does that really that grit boil down to a a death to self a death to self that you don't reason to agree with carnality you reason to agree with God's word amen because if you if we agree with God's word God's word can be manifested in our lives hallelujah hallelujah now we live in the greatest day there's ever been amen there's never been so much light as today amen shining amen amen now it's it's it's when the word is made manifest that the Bible calls that light just like here in Matthew 4 Jesus and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernum which is upon the Sea Coast and the borders of Zebula Neilon that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of Niland by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up yes from that time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of God is at hand amen so so naturally they just saw a man who looked like any other man walking into their land you know but spiritually great light sprang up upon them now they sat in darkness but they just but we got to realize and and they're in the shadow of death but naturally they had families they had synagogue they had their Commerce their businesses all these things but they were sitting in the shadow of death but then great light sprang up upon them because because all the promises of the Messiah were now being made manifest in their day where it was no longer prophecy it was now reality am mean so light sprung up now there's great power in light amen Darkness remember darkness is absence of light that's all darkness is amen as soon as you turn a light on all the darkness goes away amen the the darkness can never overcome the light amen the light is far stronger than the darkness now light has has has has power in it amen it takes light to bring life amen amen it takes light to bring life amen that's why Springtime now well you know the weather who knows it doesn't even know what it's doing but you know we're in springtime amen and and and you can have a garden bed all sorted out during the winter time you can have all you think all the weeds are gone and you know everything's okay amen but then when but then when the sun comes closer to the Earth amen and the temperature begins to raise and then the sun begins to get stronger here upon the Earth those things that you think you have dealt with come to life why because the light of the sun has Shone upon your garden amen because it takes the light of the sun to bring forth natural seed now how much more am mean now that's just the natural now and the supernatural it takes the supernatural light of God to bring the seed of God to life now a seed that is just a seed just only has potentials it can potentially become say a apple tree you know you you you have a seed of an apple potentially it can become a tree right all of the all of the bushels of apples that will ever come out of that tree is in that seed potentially amen but it's got to be planted in the right atmosphere it's got to be watered it's got to have the right sunlight amen for the potential to become reality now the word of God quickens the seed of God I mean that's why it's so important the message of the hour will it's the only thing that can awaken the Bride of this day that's right amen it will the light of the word awakens the bride amen now so so what the what the light does does now is there's a seed and and elect people of the bride of Christ amen that when the light of the word strikes them the potentials become reality amen it's no longer just potentials it becomes into manifestation just like the Apple Tree am mean you plant it comes to life you take the apple and you eat it it's no longer a potential it's manifested you're enjoying the fruit of it amen you see it growing you see it right there you don't have to say well I think the tree will be this tall it'll be this wide the apples will be this flavor no it's no longer potentials it's manifested who's with me today amen so it's the same thing now with the light of this word in the end time amen it m it it it brings to life a seed of predestination I mean there no longer a potentially a bride on the earth it's now reality amen it's now a reality I trust you just walking with me for a little bit because if we realize what God has really done for us am mean what he has really done that he's not just made us a church he's not just made us a different group of people he hasn't just made us a you you a a a kind of a subgroup in society or or however you want to put it but God's word has quickened to us I mean he's made that seed of predestination come to life because he saw within us the potential to be the bride amen and if God sees a potential it doesn't come to a halfway manifestation it'll come to a full manifestation amen but when you realize that you're called for this that the word has awoken you to be the bride of Christ it should give you such a grit amen it should give you such a passion that all of because remember his passion was that day on Calvary and what was his passion for you to be made in His image washed in his blood amen that his potentials go into you amen that now it's not just a man it's now a multimember body amen that are that are manifesting the word of God I mean that was his passion to see you come to your position am mean that you would stand on every neck of the enemy that you would overcome every trouble I mean you could walk in Victory in spite of your Humanity you would walk and you would stand flat footed in every trial that's what his passion was amen and if our passion becomes his passion amen what could take place even this morning amen that God could come down in a powerful way that we wouldn't need just a Sunday night at camp but God could come down and meet every need hallelujah amen I believe it amen because now we are no longer potential we're reality amen that the word of God the prophecy of the Bride is no longer prophecy it's no longer just circling around the earth waiting for a people but the people are here manifesting that promise amen hallelujah why because the light has quickened remember brother would say you know the light didn't couldn't Quicken the rock it can't Quicken the dirt it quickens the seed amen and you got to realize that God built you that way doesn't matter how you feel what mind battles are going on forget all that stuff remember the devil okay let's just I'm just trying to behave but let's not do that no more amen remember what God gave you the devil has no right to keep from you he has no right to keep it from you so remember so David David had an incredible journey right he was predestinated to be the king of Israel who believes that am mean Samuel did not go to Jesse's house and said I'll pick one cuz his pick was not God's pick am mean before before Samuel ever went to Jesse's house before even God told him to go there there was a king in that family there was a predestinated King but you see he needed the light of God to Quicken the seed of God that he would come to manifestation and so now here he is there David just being David but in him his kingship right and so now he he is so so there's already been prophecy that's actually hanging over his life because in Genesis if I could find it here am mean there's a there's a prophecy that that the scepter would not depart out of Judah until Shiloh come so kingship had to come into the tribe of Judah amen kingship had to come into the tribe of Judah so now so because the son of David so because the king the Messiah would come out of that tribe and so that kingship had to come into Judah and David was a manifestation of that where the kingship would come into that tribe he didn't know that but God knew that amen so so there he is just living his old kind of a life as a boy as a shepher different things but then the light of God comes his way through a Vindicated Prophet where he takes the Horn of anointing oil and pours it out over DAV that all the potential in David will comes a manifestation in It season amen that he would be king that would take the fullness of the promise and every Divine promise given to Moses would be now manifested amen it's the same thing with you and I you know you know what this message is it's a horn of anointing oil amen it's an anointing amen that that that a Vindicated Prophet stood upon the Earth and poured out amen God would use a vessel Amen to pour an anointing out am mean cuz there were seeds upon the Earth that had to come to manifestation seeds of the Bride amen seeds of God in Bride form amen this is the bride coming of Jesus Christ amen that when you people should be able to see you and see God not your Humanity but deity living in you amen that's what they should be able to see amen so Hallelujah this is what this message is it's not just Doctrine it's not just restored truth that's all part of it it's not just church order and different things it's an anointing amen that the word of God would put on flesh in you and I amen that every it'll be no longer prophecy but it become manifestation Hallelujah so now David David had a lot of struggles in his life he had a lot of battles in his life you read psalms a lot of them Lord help me deliver me from my enemies they can pass about me I'm all in trouble and I you know my pillows wet with tears and all these different things had a lot of trouble but that didn't but that did not change the fact that he was King you know Hallelujah you get anointed by by God the devil will come after you David was anointed king by all the tribes and it says in the Bible that the Philistines come to find him oh yes that's right right amen but the devil but the Philistines got defeated amen so when the enemy you know you take one foot on Victory and the enemy tries to push you off that Victory but you got to realize no I'm anointed to stand here I mean the devil's not called to stand in this promise I'm called to stand in This Promise am mean so because he knew he was anointed king and he was aligned with that prophecy see here the thing we got to stay aligned with the word like Paul would say many years after the road to Damascus I was not disobedient into the heavenly vision right so what he is called to be he stayed in right David he knew his anointed king he stayed right with that God's called me so he had enough grit to say I'm staying with this promise doesn't matter if I'm on the run doesn't matter what I or any trouble that comes into my life God you have prophesied I'm this so he surrendered to that prophecy who's with me am mean because some people say well if I'm the bride God will make me the bride don't just sit back if God has given you a promise go possess it amen if I said I had1 billion and it was yours I think you'd be leaving this building and going to go get it if it was on the other side of the world you had to go physically get it you would you would you had gone to debt I mean you'd give everything come on I would if there was $10 billion to me in in the UK I'd be buying a ticket somehow and I'd be there cuz it's given to me right let's no you can't say oh I wouldn't do yeah you would you'd be at the Wellington airport even if the flight's 2 Days Later you'd be waiting or you'd be driving up to Oakland you'd be doing something crazy because why A promise is given to you you're going possess that promise amen now that's just of the natural how much more eternal life how much more every promise of God Amen if God has given it then I'm going to give all my life I'm going to surrender all that I am that I can obtain that promise amen like the Apostle Paul would say I can't all things but dung that I wi Christ you see he had grit Amen to count all of his old life but dung oh yeah that he would possess every Divine promise of God hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so David David stayed with that that's why he didn't try and kill Saul and you know maneuver his way into kingship at the right time you know because he knew God would Place him there at the right time but he came to a place where now where now he was in Zig now it's amazing how in transition there can be great trouble here he was Saul Saul had died in battle he was now you know going to be be made King over Israel but now he lost everything when he's about to possess everything oh that's an interesting thing isn't it you know because there he is David Saul's dead on the battlefield he comes back to zigg laag he's lost his wives he's lost his children not just his but his but his men that have fought with him for many years and you know he comes to a spot where even his own men that have gathered to him want to want to Stone him and they wept until they had no more power to weep amen they they were really brokenhearted over these things because no doubt during this time the devil's filling their imaginations with what the enemy is going to do to their family could you imagine I mean cuz the devil's cruel he's a wicked being imagine when they imagine if they found out oh this is David's wife this is David's children the Wrath I'd pour out upon those helpless people because of the cruel wickedness of the devil right so so no doubt those things would be playing on David's mind and also you know his men's mind but but David had a source of strength you see he had a source of strength you know that's why he encouraged himself in the Lord amen he see see his his source of strength wasn't his mental ability his source of strength wasn't what he thought he could do right his source of strength was the Lord who called him to be king amen and that's why in times of great trouble he didn't forget who he was because he went to a source of strength that's why we've always got to turn to the Lord in our time of need don't turn to people turn to God am me cuz remember if God called you he's going to place you in that predestinated place am mean if he called you to become the bride you're going to become the bride Hallelujah so so he's in this time of great trouble but we got to realize you know many times we think well you know the devil take something from us maybe our joy maybe our peace you know maybe a few years ago we were shouting running the O now we're like a church mouse in the church and because the devil's coming and taking taking something from us and then he'll tell you you don't deserve that you're not worthy of that thing amen you went too far and you can't get it back and he'll give you all the reasons why you can't possess it amen but then you've got to realize the devil didn't give it to you in the first place amen he didn't give it to you in the first place so he has no right to keep it from you amen if God gave it to you he wants you to keep it amen he wants you to possess it he wants you to enjoy it amen so if you had a shout before you can go back and get your shout amen if you had Joy before you can go back and get your joy and mean the devil has no right to keep it from you whatsoever it's yours hallelujah amen you got to realize that amen something's been taken from you you have right to go get it cuz God gave it to you the devil didn't give you it God gave it to you and God wants you to possess it amen that's why you've got to have enough grit to go get it back may take some time in prayer whatever it takes you say Lord I want it back I want the peace of God that P will understand to to rule my life I want my joy back I want my shout back amen because it's mine amen it's mine I want it hallelujah hallelujah amen I don't want to just sit here and remember the could bees of life no we're not ordained to live that way Hallelujah Lord we don't live with a memory the devil lives with a memory he remembers what it was like to be the anointed J that coverthe what it was like to be God's right-hand man he can never go back there he's going to burn up we have a memory of where we came from that's why God's revealed it to us right but we don't live I hope I'm not tripping myself up here but we don't live by memory of what we used to have only the devil could only live by that memory of what he used to be he wants to be like the most high he'll never become that way like he wants to be because we're here right God has always had a witness he wants to get rid of the seed of God then he can become what he really wants to be but there's a people upon the Earth that won't bow to the devil amen but you see now us we don't just live with a memory we live with the present God Amen am mean we don't have to look back and say well I used to I used to I used to pray I used to cry I used to be so happy I used to have so much peace I used to look at the world and everything was awesome because God's Alive and I saw him in his nature and his Universe I saw him in me I saw him in his son it's not just a you you don't have to live in a used to kind of a way well when I was younger I used to what about now I mean what about now I believe David's greatest Psalms were written in the time of greatest trouble amen because he could stand in that trouble and know God called him to go through the trouble amen that his final destination wasn't that loss it wasn't the ashes of zigg that wasn't where he was meant to end up he was going to the throne amen and if he has going to the throne his wives were coming with him if he going to the throne his children were coming with him amen if he has going to the Throne all that the all that the enemy took from him will be restored Hallelujah that's why that's why he inquired of the Lord and the Lord said You shall recover all without fail amen he didn't just sit in those ashes amen he went and pursued am me he went and got back what the devil stole from him am mean he had enough grit to say if God promised it I'm going to get them back and they're not going to be dead I'm not going to carry dead bodies back home I'm carrying my living children my living spouse amen they're going to come back to where they were I'm God's going to restored amen so he had grit Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at people with grit this morning am me with a real courage and a bold say God's word said it I believe it that settles it hallelujah hallelujah that's the kind of people you are right now not in the future right now you're that kind of a person I mean you've got grit to overcome I mean you've got grit to look the devil in the face say devil enough's enough I'm going to dismantle your schemes I'm going to pull you apart you're going to regret ever coming to my house you know we have testimonies of great Victory the devil has testimonies of great defeat amen that's right you know trauma is a real thing yeah the Devil he's full of trauma yeah because you remember the day you got saved Jesus came into your heart the devil got dethroned and Jesus Took up residence in his rightful position am mean you remember the day when you had terrible mind battles and then God came and that Spirit got cast out remember any any any conversation you have in your mind that puts doubt on the word of God is a devil you got to you know anything that distracts you into a negative thing is the devil right but you remember those days where those things got cast out am Hallelujah you remember those days don't you now you remember that with great joy cuz you're in Chained and now you're free you're blind now you can see you're dead now you're alive am mean so so you remember when when you would wake up with regret say I can't believe I did that the devil would drag you down like a slave master beat you make you do ridiculous things and you thought you cool at the time but all you have now is Regret because you're trying to fit him with the wrong crowd but then you remember when that slave master was drowned in the blood of Jesus Christ I mean you can see it in the Red Sea ground and dead and you're on the other side amen you remember those days they're great days the devil don't remember those days with the joy you have amen here's the all man you know he just sits there with trauma amenl Hallelujah because you know a testimony for one that's good is a testimony that's bad for the other I'm glad we're on the good side I'm not I'm so glad we're not on the bad side amen that we don't just have a twing all let's just let's just let's just not talk about that you know no we've been liberated been translated to the kingdom of his dear son hallelujah amen so I think we can Rejoice see the devil has a lot of trauma but we can just rejoice in what God has done amen amen now the word made manifest as light now we know that we're living in the day where there's the greatest light shining we're living in Bible days yes sir right we're living in a time when the son of man has been revealed through a prophetic Ministry amen the hearts of the children have been turned back to the hearts of the fathers through the message of the hour am me you got to look at what the what this message has has has said it will produce is producing it amen you you got to look at now you going to say I am the product of God's Amazing Grace amen I'm the product of it I didn't just talk about it I'm the product of it I mean why because God has put a faith in my life let's just let's just all focus in God's put a faith in our life that's overcoming Faith God's put a faith in our life to overcome every trouble you may have a lot of trouble right now but remember don't let the devil keep you under guilt don't let them keep you under shame okay we were all in darkness once upon a time we may even willfully go and trip up but if we say Lord pick me up again try me again forgive me Lord there's enough blood to keep you for every day of your life right it's not just for when you get saved it's for every day there's a he's making intercession on your behalf amen so never let the devil live you under see the reason people live under guilt as the devil's Twisted in their mind that the blood is not enough that yeah you should have known better we all should have should have known better and stages in our walk right David should have known better when he took bash Sheba yet there he was he was an adopted son of God in his position on the throne he's a he was a mature believer think about about it he wasn't just a strapping who just who just got saved the other day no he was 50 odd years old when that happened he was adopted positionally placed in the body of Christ right but there was enough blood under the blood of bulls and goats for God to forgive him that was just under the see so so he came to a place where the guilt he no longer carried that guilt he no longer carried the shame because he realized that God allowed all those things because he was straying because instead of pressing the battle and having grit to go take the kingdom he was sitting back in the palace just just just you relaxing like that and that was actually his his heart was wandering from God because he was wandering from the prophecy that was over his life of becoming King right so it's the same thing with you and I it can happen that our that our hearts can begin to wander from the prophecy of that we are the bride of Christ I'll let the Holy Spirit blow sound of a rushing Mighty Wind Hallelujah Hallelujah let the Holy Spirit blow Amen Let don't be worried about the wind hallelujah amen but you see he wasn't see he strayed from it that's why he did that but then he says I think in Psalms 50 he says you have created me a clean heart oh Lord and and renew a right Spirit within me that the bones that thou broken May Rejoice amen so he realized all that happened that so so God could bring him back to him amen so so so he realized there was good in it so he didn't live under the shame anymore but the devil wants to keep you under shame or under guilt don't live under those things our His Banner Over Us is love amen that's right he doesn't pull the banner away from his elect amen there's always a banner of love over us no matter what we do but we've got to realize what's flying over us but the devil wants to put a cloud of guilt above us God's taking care of the guilt remember it says in Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our iniquities the chastising our people was a problem he was bruised for our iniquities iniquity is to know right but do the contrary he's taking care of it all so don't let don't let the devil keep you under guilt or shame amen amen so nowu there is so much light in this day and the reason there's so much light in this day is that we would be like the young man with Elisha as they would see there's more for us than there are against us amen that all of Heaven is a on the earth amen that you know it's not just us walking this walk if I repeat myself I just I feel to do it just now cuz we're going to realize we're not here alone amen that God the angels of God are here amen God himself is here amen we'll physically meet him in the air that body is not returned right it will one day and we'll meet the Lord in the air but his spirit is here all that he is is present amen just like the Centurion you know came to Jesus and said yo Jesus was going to go pray for a sick servant but the Centurion said no you just speak the word and and and he'll be made whole because the Centurion realized that the word of Jesus was exactly the same as Jesus physically going and laying his hands upon the servant and so God is his word so where his word is he is because you can't separate him in the word amen so now the word has come open in this day amen the seals have come open which reveals Christ amen so there's never been as much light as there is right now and the reason that the light is so strong is that we would realize that we actually actually there's another dimension that's here with us that's far more real than the one we see now we know that our five senses that we're given amen none of these will declare God seeing hearing tasting touching whatever it is none of those senses that we have in this body are given to contact God but how much but but we lean so much on those five senses for this Earthly Journey but it's only faith that can touch God Amen and God has given us a faith amen that is stronger than what we see it is stronger than what we hear now it depends what you lean upon if you lean upon your five senses you'll get the results of your five senses just like the young man saying we're doomed the armies are all around us we're stuck he was leaning on us five senses but Elisha wasn't leaning on those five senses though he saw the same things that the man saw amen but he was leaning on faith Hallelujah and that's why he said Lord open his eyes Amen to reveal what was really there amen so now look here friends let me give you this illustration I might have done it before what color is that shirt it's white anyone that's got sight knows that shirts white you have five senses of the body see taste feel smell here now none of those senses will declare God when God made man he made him in his image the spirit man put him in five senses to contact his Earthly home not to contact god with those senses don't declare God they declare the Earthly home where the man had to contact his Earthly home he had to see taste feel spell and here but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you do not see it taste it feel it smell it or hear it but you believe it now you see what I mean why because that faith is greater than the five senses I think if we can just surrender to to to that faith that six sense of Faith amen it doesn't matter what the five senses declare that six sense of faith will override all who's with me today now there's always been a longing wherever for for people to see God I'm just kind of taking a sway this but just just bear with me okay there was always a longing for the believer to see God even the disciples Philip would say unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us the Greeks came to Jes um came to the disciples said sir we would see Jesus because if you can see God then you can contact God right if you can see God you can now now I'm talking about faith now okay so when I say seeing I'm not talking about natural sight I'm talking about faith that's right okay so if you can see him you can contact him we can contact him today amen okay so yeah right now Jesus said unto him have I been so long with you and yet thou has not known me Phillip he that has seen me has seen the father and how say thou show us the father why because Jesus is saying have I been so long with you I've been right with you but it was the veil of his Humanity that that that philli couldn't quite see past and then believeth thou not that I in the Father the father in me the words that I speak unto you there um I I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works so he's saying the father that's dwelling in me is doing what you see so Jesus would go to lazarus's grave and he'd say Lazarus come forth that was the father doing that was God doing it we know Jesus was the god man right but you see you see it was it was the father doing the works of raising Lazarus amen it was the father cing the Sea of Galilee it was the father feeding the 5,000 all those things it was God manifest tested amen and he says now if you can't see if you can't really see me see the father see what he does and then you can see it's really God I mean believe me that I'm in the Father the father of me or else believe me for the very work sake so he's saying now you see the manifestation of God you're seeing God right you see the manifestation you see him amen this is very important because if we see God moving we say there's God Amen cuz we know we say oh Jes when we say Jesus is here we're not saying there's a physical man of us so so much height with a beard and you know Palestinian garment walking around no his spirit is here right doing the works that he did back there amen because he's alive today amen and so when we see his Holy Spirit Come Among Us and do the works amen we can say that Jesus is here and we're seeing God manifested now you can see that not just in you know preaching or singing of things but in person's life you should I trust we can look beyond the natural Veil and we can see the father because God is in flesh today Amen in in in you and I now this is very important because if we can see God then it gives us a grit that we can possess the promise amen because God is here we can contact God by faith amen and God can give us what we have need of who's with me today amen and then so Jesus now says if you basically see the father then if you believe amen that the works that see he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also so now if you see a manifest it and you believe the same thing can happen out of your life and this is why Jesus had the disciples for three and a half years and he manifested him his glory to them that now when the Holy Ghost came into them they realized that what he did we'll do also because he's in us now right so so God see Jesus opened the Unseen realm to the disciples and now the message in the end time what does it do it opens heaven to you and I that we can realize what was in what was in the ministry of brother brandom that same God is in the bride of Christ amen that's why it says he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father that's why we can look at the ministry of brother brandham and we can rejoice in the Supernatural but we Rejoice not just in a historical fact amen but we Rejoice now that that same God is Among Us amen that's why we can Rejoice you read the book of Acts and the Holy Ghost filling people we rejoice in that not just because it's a historical fact but because he does the same thing today am mean that we can see the pillar of fire come down Among Us and do the supernatural works of God Amen so why because we've seen God in this day manifested in a prophet and we've seen God in this day manifested in the bride of Christ hallelujah amen if you can see see this see to me this should give us such grit if we realize God's Not Just In Heaven somewhere brother said Dey is not just in heaven it's in you am me that the god that we're contacting by faith is not somewhere in another dimension only but he's present upon the Earth he's not a million miles away but he's here right now to meet every need Hallelujah now if you look through the scriptures look through the gospels you see there are there are people that have a real grit they have a real perseverance and and I'm just going to maybe wind up with this thought we'll see how we go but Jesus would Jesus would speak well uh you know Mark would give the account and you know it's in a few a few different um gospels of this sarapan woman I mean she was a Greek a serap phenician Woman by nation and so she saw that g or she heard that this Man From Galilee was more than a prophet he was more than a religious leader but he was God yeah she this was revealed to her her now because it was revealed it gave her a grit to get what she needed right it gave her perseverance that she could persevere through many different obstacles to get what she needed she see Christian grit gives you the perseverance to not rest until you get what you need right Christian grit does not quit halfway amen it doesn't quit halfway it doesn't matter what the trouble is you may get discouraged but there's something greater in you than your discouragement right you may see things in the negative but there's something in you that's greater than the negative amen there's a faith that pulls you to him amen that something in you if we just let Faith control Our Lives if we really just let go and let God be God I think his brother impul said a few months ago we're going to let God be God I mean we can't let him just be an Aron boy or a mascot or or or even just an object of worship we're going to let him be Supreme let him take control completely amen if we can just let God be God today am mean God can do what God does does amen hallelujah I believe it amen so now now here she was she was she was perseverant because she besought him that because there was a devil in her daughter now notice she did not take her daughter to Jesus she went to Jesus for her daughter amen because she believed that if if he just spoke the word that demon had to go irrespective of where she was that demon had to go amen so so she she had a real grit in her that a lot of the Jewish people didn't have amen God God put it in her amen now she had a lot of she had a lot of obstacles but her faith did not have any obstacles amen because she went to Jesus she called out son of David have mercy amen but then but then David I mean I mean um Jesus ignored her the disciples said you know send her away different things and then and then she got into the presence of Jesus now many times we think we just get into his presence then it's all over that's where the battle really begins because here she comes no doubt she thinking oh finally I'm here don't know how far she had to travel I don't know you know what things she had to do to get there but she got there but then now he looks her in the eyes and said you know it's not meat to give the children's bread to cast it to dogs now if she didn't have that grit she would have got offended how dare he I believe he's Messiah I believe he can heal my daughter and look what he calls me calls me a dog but see grit Christian grit goes beyond and also those things happen to prove what's in you because her faith was greater than any obstacle that could be thrown in front of her see Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail the revelation of who Jesus Christ is she had the Revelation this man's Messiah he's more than a Prophet this is God in flesh so nothing could stop her getting to him to get what she needed amen so so there she goes but you see she came in humility amen she came in reverence and humility she didn't come proud see a lot of people they think oh I've I know who I am I can tell you all the quotes all the scriptures I can go from Genesis to revelation God owes me something you don't get nothing from God like that I've got all the pins the belt buckles and the hat and I got all the paraphernalia I've Been Everywhere seen all the things no we you don't get goded anything like that it takes a reverent humility yes right Amen to get what we need so she came said yay Lord but even even the even the dogs get the crumbs from from underneath the master's table she was just looking for a crumb and that crumb was enough amen that crumb was enough to set her daughter free amen if we just go crumb searching Hallelujah if we just go crumb searching in the Bible you can look for a small promise that promise is more than enough to meet whatever need you have amen but you if we come and humility sure Lord I may not deserve a slice but I'm just here for anything am mean I'm here for just the smallest Speck I know that smallest Speck of a blessing is enough to to to meet my need amen and and see she said yes Lord and that Lord means Supreme in Authority amen see she knew who he was amen this a that she realized that he's Supreme and supreme and Authority that he is as an n a controller by implication he is God he's Lord he's master amen so she went to him realizing you're the Supreme one Lord you can do whatever you can meet my need amen you're more than able see because she knew who he was it gave her a grit and a perseverance to get what she needed amen this is why we are a people of vision this morning because we know he's all powerful he's allmighty he's omnipotent amen he can do anything amen he is the he is the master amen he is he is the sup he's Supreme Authority he speaks a word every Devil's got to shut up he speaks one word every demon has has to move back to their place amen and you got to realize that voice is in you amen that's right amen the voice of God is in the bride of Christ amen but you see he's a supreme one now see she she confessed this and she got what she needed now it's very interesting that before this before this um account Jesus begins to speak about what really defiles a man that's amaz see uh see many times you read the gospels it's interesting how things are ordered they're ordered for a certain way because now here's Jesus speaking before this account we just read about it says now that which defiles a man is out the the things from within the heart evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders THS covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy Pride foolishness all these evil things come from within and defile the man now here now here comes a woman that's going to show really what see see cuz it's there's two things things that come out of you can either defile you or it can redeem you whatever comes out right Jesus is giving the negative this is what comes out of a man that defiles them but now here comes a woman in humility and reverence and respect amen and it wasn't Pride didn't come out of her heart when she responded to the word amen evil thoughts you know blasphemy foolishness none of those things came out of her deceit none of those things came out of her when she was talking to the Lord but it was out of her pure heart she came before him amen I trust you're following me amen see see see see God tests what's within us amen and I trust that when we we have grit that there's nothing negative in us see if we got a real Christian grp we going say Lord cleanse Me of anything that's not of you anything that's contrary to your word Lord take it out of me that's real Christian grit I mean when when we can we can can lay ourselves upon his altar of his word and let him take anything out of our Lives that's contrary to his word I mean you see so when she came to him she was in that kind of condition cuz God revealed to her who he was amen so when she approached him it wasn't arrogantly it wasn't in Pride she didn't get offended and and and the Lord would even say in one place great is thy faith amen great is I Faith this another account am mean and she was made whole you see faith is a source that others don't see see we got grit today I'm just going to wind down with these Source faith is stronger than anything Faith created the worlds because God believed his own word when he said let there be sun moon and stars right Faith moves mountains Faith raises the dead that's Revelation faith when it's revealed to you right amen Faith part of the Red Sea Faith brought fire down from heaven on Mount Carmel amen faith Faith took Elijah in a Rapture amen Faith raised the dead raised Lazarus out of the Grave conquered HDE in the grave that was Revelation Faith because Jesus had a revelation of who he was right so it's a source that others don't see see it's see it's those hidden things you know I was told was brother Ron Spencer accounted it a few years ago that you know there's a great horse race in in America called the Kentucky Derby and many Rich horse owners will spend millions and millions of dollars to try and find a horse that will win win the race and and one year there was a horse that didn't look like a winner you know but but but when it was bought there was something about this horse it wasn't the right height didn't see the right dimensions or the right muscle strength or whatever at a certain age but the buyer looked could somehow look beyond the physical stature and said this horse is a winner and then there were other horses who looked like winners but didn't win but the one who didn't look like the winner won that race and it wasn't even sold for that very much apparently but it won a multi million dollar race why cuz it had a real grit on the inside I mean it had something on the inside that others couldn't see it had a source that was Far Beyond just a natural ability amen and that's what faith is it's a source that's far beyond natural ability amen that we can that we can look beyond what we see and go possess every promise I'm just going to wind up with these things but look this but this little woman that we read about she was a Greek but she had heard of Jesus and Faith cometh by what hearing hearing the word of God now she was a Greek of another Nation but you know though she wasn't in the belief of that she was of A different race of people yet you know Faith finds a source that others don't see some people say I can't see what you're seeing but you see it right Faith finds a source that others doesn't see and her faith had found that Source now she knew that by hearing if she'd have got there that it was going to happen amen the word of God according to Hebrews the 4th chapter and the 12th verse is sharper than a two-edged sword we we know that faith is what holds that sword there's nothing else can hold the sword of the Bible but faith in God that yields it now we find now you might be weak with your arm of Faith but maybe you can just cut out justification maybe you can just cut out enough to join the church but a good strong arm of faith can cut through to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it can cut through to Divine Healing it can cut through to gifts miracles signs wonders it can cut every promise of God out of the skies and claim it because it's yielding the word of God you know it's like if you who's ever seen like in the um what used to be called thep show I don't know what the country shows are called these days but you know you see the ax chopping competitions who's ever seen that you know and some guys is like one blow and the whole thing's in half and you know but those who start in the competition they might not be able to go as fast as the winner they might not be able to be as strong as the winner but they're determined to make those cuts right they may have to land more blows but they get the job done so you may think well I'm not very strong in faith I can't hold the word in such a strong arm of Faith like someone else I say just keep cutting C amen just keep cutting your cut may only take up a little chunk but just just keep cutting until that promise is reality am mean keep holding that promise before God am mean keep focusing on that promise that's how you cut amen if you realize peace is mine then then then look into the word where it says that his peace he that he gives unto you focus on that promise this this is how you start cutting start meditating upon that promise and start thinking now God has given it to me by the blood of Jesus Christ amen and then what will happen that promise will become a revelation will become a reality to you amen so you may be strong but keep cutting don't quit it could just be one more blow it could be one more prayer it could be one more amen it could be one more praise the Lord it could be one more quote you don't know and the thing will be gone and it'll become reality amen so don't quit amen we've got a grit we can't quit amen hallelujah hallelujah amen she had many hindrances but uh if you'd happened to go to think about it but her faith didn't have any that's it if your faith don't have any hindrances it's different she had but her faith had hindrances I mean but her faith had no hindrances sorry Faith doesn't know no hindrance Faith only knows one thing it's goal that's all so let's let our faith focus on the goal what's our goal Rapture amen what's the part of that goal our family Hallelujah what's the goal whosoever will let them come that should be our goal what's Camp going to be let's just leave this world am imagine that Sunday night we have a prayer line and then you see all these young people start joining the prayer line you realize there's more than 300 people now there's there's over 300 people at camp this year you said where are all these other people coming from that's right and you realize it's the dead in Christ amen and they start to join the prayer line Hallelujah imagine that and then we just and then for 40 days I don't know then and then we're out of here wouldn't that be cool hallelujah amen we're we're at Camp we're praying for someone they may be on the other side of the world then and then and then you go back to your bank and you get a text message or a phone call or a voice message and they said God something happened to me I was going in my car was going here and there just this anointing Came Upon This Feeling I got to surrender my life to the Lord what you been telling me all these years something said it's true and I gave myself to it now what must I do you know God can do those kind of things amen cuz Faith releases the power of God me it doesn't matter where the person is whatever's going on it releases the power of God to that person so don't let the devil tell you your prayers don't matter don't let the devil tell you you're not worthy to receive it you're more than worthy cuz Jesus made made you more than worthy amen he purchased your salvation that down Calvary to give you every Divine promise I mean so never think see the devil says you can't have it God don't go I mean the devil don't give out the promise that's right the devil's a bluff he's a liar amen don't listen to him in his nonsense you're more than worthy amen oh but what about this shame what about this guilt God took care of it that down Calvary do you believe it amen so our God can do anything amen amen so let's go to Camp rejoicing why don't we just start rejoicing right now why don't let's just stand to our feet and let's let's thank God for a tremendous Camp let's thank God for every need's going to be met Amen in our lives let's thank God for prodical coming home let's thank God for many people being filled with the Holy Ghost let's thank God for healing thank God
