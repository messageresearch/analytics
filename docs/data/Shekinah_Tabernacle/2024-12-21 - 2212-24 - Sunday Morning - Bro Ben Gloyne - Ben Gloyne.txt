TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] for [Music] I [Music] s [Music] [Laughter] me thank you we going okay I'll start again I'm very happy to be here this morning I'm happy to see you all I'm happy to be to have an opportunity to meet with the Living God this morning I'm happy to be able to sing praises to the Lord and I'm happy to be able to um hear the word of God this morning I think this is one of the best things we can ever do on this Earth really is to get in the presence of God and here we are this morning lying at the cusp of it all even now you know we're in it so we're going to have such a good time and just as I was um trying to get a few songs together last night the song kept on coming to me which was um lift up your heads oh your Gates swing wide you Everlasting and the song used to be a toad a song actually because every time we would go there there was a time where they were having a real Revival and there was there were a lot of new people coming and I think over the course of two or three years it just exponentially grew and it was just an amazing time to go there each every couple of months and just be a part of that and they always seem to sing the song So it always always related the song to them but then when we came here I don't know how this happened but over time brother Kubin sort of snatched the song from them and it became his song so every time we sing it I always think of brother Kubin and um I am going to come and ask you to pray so make sure can you make sure he's got a mic um but you know I said to him last week you know when when the anointing comes down and we're just worshiping the Lord I often sometimes I have my eyes closed and I'm just worshiping and it feels so good that I can just play naturally and worship I feel so happy that I can just express everything naturally when I want to but then in the back I hear Kubin start to clap and it's so far at a time you wouldn't believe it you know it just goes and no matter what we're playing man that clap is just going to do whatever it wants and it makes me feel so good I said to him last week don't ever stop doing that if you want to clap you clap as loud as you can man and you clap you clap as out of time as you can cuz it means something to me it means it means you just want to express it and you just want to praise the Lord you know it's so good and we all just praise the Lord in our own different way but that's just a a special way that brother Kubin do so can I ask you to come up and open up in prayer brother Kubin and let's um let's stand this morning [Music] amen let's give a clap for brother [Applause] [Music] Kubin sorry is it on let's bow our heads loving father we just come before you humbly this morning Lord Jesus this Resurrection morning my father we all are

no service on Christmas day amen so um if you come here and the lights are off well it's because there's no service so I'll put a reminder out but yeah God bless you trust you all have a very blessed day that day and today amen so we're going to read Romans um 89-1 here it says but if you uh but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so uh if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit of is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you yeah amen we're just going to read um here in Luke chap 2 10-14 just a bit of a um I guess a context I was going to speak on something and then last night my thoughts just went to a totally different direction so U I just pray this all kind of ties together today uh but here the uh this is the Angel speaking to the Shepherds he says and the and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which uh shall be for all people for un he was born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a Manger he said suddenly there was uh with a with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Good Will toward men amen so let's uh let's pray this morning amen let's bow our heads and amen gracious father we're so thankful as we bow our heads we can talk to the great author of of the word Lord Jesus you and we thank you as we've read your word we're asking once again Lord may he come down Among Us Lord may you anoint your word speaker and hearer as we come into this Christmas time I pray we would truly remember what Christmas is really all about which is you father and I pray Lord as we um spend these next few moments looking into your word I pray that you'd open it to us make it live in our lives Lord may you enrich our lives by your presence we need you more than ever before this day we thank you Lord we pray that also you'd be with those who are not here be their portion be their strength Lord those who are sick and body heal them Father we love you Lord take control now For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you uh everyone you can have your seats this morning so I want to talk about God's God's wrapped gift so God's gift to the age amen God's gift to you amen so I want to talk about that today seeing it's the Christmas season and I guess really uh this could be for any any any Sunday but this is a good um time to speak about it because you know really as as this world has gotten busier and you uh the hustle and bustle of life has just really increased I think it's time when we we really take stock of really what Christmas is all about so am mean so God God God always sends a gift to every age and God's I just going to make some uh as we go along I'll try and keep up with the slideshow and everything but you know uh see this see this gift we know is God's Gift of eternal life which which which should be in you Christ in you the hope of glory the scripture would say now we know God's gifts are always misunderstood they're always uh they're always misunderstood by the world and even when you think about you know uh uh the day of Pentecost when you know when the Holy Ghost had come the you know God was now dwelling in his people once again the gift of eternal life was now in the church the greatest the greatest event really you know the death barri resurrection of Our Lord which of course ties in the resurrection his resurrection ties them with the resurrection of the living Saints here they were quickened from Death To Life filled with the Holy Spirit even the even the people said that you know what does this all mean they thought they're just drunk with new wine so they were misunderstanding what was going on and that's always what happens when God's Gift comes people misunderstand really the effect of it you know where where Peter would stand up and say no no hold on you're misunderstanding what you see these people aren't drunk but they're filled with the Holy Ghost this what you see in front of you is the Fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel so people will misunderstand the message of the hour right they'll misunderstand God sending a prophet they'll say it's a cult or it's a people following a man or it's just Pentecostalism with the gifts and you know you know with a Twist added to it see cuz people always try and put you in a box they always try and put God's Gift in a box because they misunderstand what's going on so don't be don't be surprised if people misunderstand when you try and share with them the hope that you have within you amen of of the resurrection of this word that's coming to this age to transform our bodies right because people want to what are you are you Baptist are you Pentecostal are you what what is this you know you Jehovah's Witness are you what you know but no we believe the full word of God you know as as the king I mean as Paul would say to King AG grippa in the way that is called heresy do I worship the god of our fathers believing all the law and the prophets we just believe the whole word of God around here right so people want to always misunderstand what's going on what what what God's gift is they think it's something else because they see the manifestation of it they want to put that in a box trying and work out what it is but but we can say no this is not this is not a uh you know something that you a box that you know God can't be put in a box right you know this is no this is the word spoken by Malachi 4 of turning the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen this is the revealing of the son of man this is the full restoration of the word amen this is the prophecy of Joel saying I will restore right all these things are included but you see it's the wrapping see what happens is they were caught up in the wrapping because God's Gift went from Jesus into the church right and so God's gift is always wrapped so we're going to go through the wrapping and the inside but it's the inside that counts okay so the wrapping does show what's inside but the wrapping is not the most important thing I'll say the wrapping can be the biggest stumbling point of the gift amen cuz you know Israel see see God's gift to Israel when they were in Egypt was Moses god heard their cries God came down to fulfill the word and what did he do he said I've heard the cries of my people when he speaking to Moses at the burning bush he says behold I'll I'm sending you he says I've come down to deliver them but I'm sending you what did he do he wrapped himself up in humanity and A Man Called Moses as a prophet messenger and so now what happened is those people who stumbled at the wrapping did not get the gift of dwelling in the promised land I mean you see they would say in Exodus 14:11 you know they'd say to Moses I think this is when they were uh by the Red Sea he said you they said unto Moses has out you uh because there's no great in Egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness my question is did Moses take them out no God took them out God delivered them Moses tried once upon a time he killed one Egyptian he failed miserably I mean so it wasn't but you see they caught up in the rapping they caught up in the veil of the Prophet they didn't they were missing they were missing the the gift that God had sent them amen and how much more you know you could say about the same with our lord Jesus how how people would stumble at the rapping he is God's gift to the world but he was a lonely man of Galilee he dressed like any other man he wasn't dressed in some you know fancy kind of clothing he didn't look different you know you know we see many traditional uh pictures of Jesus that everyone's got brown hair and you know white skin whatever more but he's blonde and he's tall and he's this and no he would have looked like everyone else that's right right but it's but it's the rapping people stumble you know Jesus you know when you know when he came the people wanted a great King to deliver them they wanted a great man to come and beat down the Romans and drive them out and restore their sovereignty but what did God said God sent a baby in a Manger that was the answer to their prayer you see God sends what we need what not what we want see he sends what we need not what is according to what we think it should be and how many people will will will throw away the gift of eternal life because they disagree with the rapping oh it doesn't gel with me it doesn't agree with me I'll tell the predestinated seat of God will gel with the gift of God I mean they will J with eternal life doesn't matter if they're rich poor fat thin whatever whatever doesn't matter what skin color nationality language amen if there's a seed in there they'll say yes and they will not just look at the wrapping they'll get the gift in the wrapping that's right amen so they were expecting a great Mighty conqueror but God sent them a baby God sent them what they needed amen and it's the same thing but see you've got to accept it the way God sends it and be happy about it not just not just you you got to be so Lord thank you how however you come Lord I'm happy about that amen amen see when God anchors a little something in your heart and it says this is it believe it hold on to it that's God's word he promised he'd confirm it to you and if he confirms the word hold on to it am mean you see the wrapping uh so now I don't mean to I because I just want to get this picture of a gift because on Wednesday there's going to be a lot of exchanging of gifts go on right so I want you when you receive rece a gift or give a gift I pray that you'll see Nails God hands and eternal life which is him be given and received it will be more sure you probably there's things under the tree or whatever you do that you wanted but may it transcend that when that takes place you say thank you Lord for that gift of eternal life so when I talk about the rapping I'm talking about the Lord but I just want to just kind of solidify this this in our minds right you see the scribes and Pharisees did not like how the rapping behaved Jesus right he was always doing things contrary to what they thought the Messiah would do we know brother Braham says many times that when they would talk about the Messiah they'd say well he's going to come out of this Bible school or God's going to you know turn a crank and a you know a Stairway is going to come down from heaven and you know he's going to walk down and come to the high priest and say here I am or it's going to be brother so and so because he's a very smart kind of man but God bypassed all of that and was born in a manger but he was born we know exactly where his word said he would be born right but you see Jesus constantly did things that did not agree or gel with what the scribes and Pharisees thought the Messiah would do it's amazing you go read the gospels how many times Jesus healed or did something on the Sabbath day which wasn't contrary to the word but it was contrary to what they thought the word should be so it's amazing when he would come into their church and he would heal people they were some were tormented or sick for very many long you know for a very long time this you know this lady here that was loose from her infirmity I think it was 18 years or something that she had this problem you know and the and the synagogue leaders did not rejoice at this they weren't happy with God's Gift even being in their Church they were upset when he acted contrary to what they expected a person to act like but here was the resurrection and the life that was sitting in their Pew singing their songs listening to their word and he got up and began to do what he does and they got upset I pray we never get into that category of thing where where where things appear a little bit out of order and things don't seem quite right but it's God doing it amen cuz we got to realize that when God does something it's never out of order but but maybe we never have an attitude I don't agree with that but yet it's God the whole time right so so so they got upset they were got annoyed where where where it healed us you know they said basically don't come on the Sabbath to be healed there's six other days of the week why didn't you come and do it then but that was the day because he wanted her to rest amen after being suffering for so long and that's what the Lord wants to do he wants to heal us heal our Spirits heal our bodies we can rest and not just that but our souls most more importantly right but they got upset by what the gift was doing in their midst so they wanted they do they didn't want him there they they did not welcome him amen it's the same thing with you know and they and they could not identify because he came he came so different to what they expected they they weren't uh you know they didn't welcome him but you see the real believer isn't interested in the rapping that's right however God comes he's just happy you know they're more interested in the effects of the gift than they are the rapping people want to debate the rapping oh he came from Kentucky and he said this and he said this and all the debates and things about the prophet I'm not interested in the rapping thank God he sent us a prophet thank thank God he he sent Elijah to the Earth to restore us back to the original faith of the word I'm thankful for that but I'm more interested in the effects of his message more than the messenger himself amen it's like when Jesus would um find a man who was born blind and there be a you know there came a big debate about him you know they were you know he you know he was brought in before the scribes and fares because people said oh this is not quite him he looks like him he said no I'm the man that was born blind you've known me my entire life but now I can see and they would debate back and forth well why are you you know how can you see what happened and you know this man had never seen the rapping before he was blind y That's Right amen but then his eyes came open when he washed in the pool right because because the Lord Jesus Took clay and to me he took that clay that needed become that eyeball put it into put it upon him he said go wash in the pool of salom right so he had never seen the rapping before he had no time to be caught up in the wrapping but to me if he saw the Lord before he would have accepted him anyway right but you see thing so but then the the scribes and Pharisees were all caught up in the wrapping of the gift they couldn't they couldn't accept the fact that this that that that the Lord Jesus had had healed someone had opened someone's eyes and this had and and someone who had been born blind no one in the history of the world had ever been healed of being born blind and here was here was it right in their midst and so they then they call in the parents and of course they're afraid you got to I don't have all the scripture here but go read John 9 yeah I you I like this chapter you know but but the parents were afraid to testify yes it was Jesus who healed their son because the scribes and Pharisees said if anyone confess the lord they're going to be put out of the synagogue right you see so what happened is they said well he's of age ask him and then you know you they just said to him you know give God the praise we know this man is a sinner so basically give God praise we know God's healed you but this guy this rapping is contrary to what we think God would be amen a righteous man but you see this man born blind as I said before had no trouble with the Lord with the rapping he was just interested in the effects of God's Gift in his life amen and I pray it's the same thing with the message of the hour in your life amen you just you're just interested in the effects it saved you from sin transformed your life the Bible became a new book amen oh you you see where you are in time it's changed your nature changed your life it has transformed you all we can say is once I was lost now I'm found once I was blind once I was in religion but now I see the true Promises of the word and I Reed the Holy Ghost like they did in the book of Acts that's good enough for me amen amen you see even even the woman at the well was unsure about the rapping because of of of of cultural ideas and understandings but you see God God never um God allows the believer to go beyond those things cuz he would say when Jesus would say to her give me a drink uh she basically said we have no dealings why are you talking to me I'm a Samaritan you're a Jew there's segregation here we don't talk to one another but then but then Jesus began to talk to her about living water and you know all these things and finally you know finally uh he would um she would say we she said I know when Messiah cometh he will he will tell us these things and and he said to her he that speaks there am he so what did he do she looked she looked beyond the wrapping and saw eternal life saw the gift Hallelujah aren't you glad he came to you and did the same thing in in your life I trust we're all together here this morning amen you see you got to see how see every believer I your I believe will actually be the same way they are actually comfortable with the wrapping God takes away those preconceived ideas and then we become comfortable yes this is God I can see it in the Bible I can see it in the word I can see the message in the word that that makes the believer comfortable amen look at the Shepherds they had no problem with the Angel's message they could receive it and believe it and follow it because they were comfortable in a Manger it was like their second home they had no trouble amen receiving that Angel's message and even even the um you know even the um wise men so we go from the very poor to the very rich they had no trouble following the star you know if they had trouble they would have said no we're going to stay in Jerusalem this is where all the Palaces are this where all the nice places are but they were happy to go to go to a little out of the way Bethlehem it wasn't actually a big place to a little house to a poor family that was where that was where God's gift was they had no trouble being identified with that amen amen I trust it's the same with us oh well I'm you know raised a certain way or I've got a certain background I trust that doesn't hinder when it comes to really receiving God's Gift of eternal life you say well I was raised differently I believed differently we all believed wrong amen amen we all believe something wrong but go and God had to correct us and change us and meet us and transform us irrespective of how we are raised or whatever right but you see there's something in us that says Lord I want your gift you've given it to me I want to open it and receive it and enjoy it amen praise the Lord you see the problem is when people get caught up in the in the rapping it's because of jealousy it's really people's attitude towards the rapping dictates where the people receive the gift of God's Gift of eternal life which is him it's really their attitude towards the rapping okay as we talked about the scribes and Pharisees their attitude was not right they did not like the rapping that it that it came in okay even the you know um he said you know they would say say to this man you know um we just go to verse verse 30 I mean verse 36 here then said they to him again what did he do uh what did he to thee how opened he Thine Eyes he answered them I have told you already and you did not hear wherefore will you hear it again will you also be his disciples then they reviled him and said Thou Art his disciple but we are moses' disciples I'd like to be uh accused of being jesus' disciples wouldn't you like that amen we know that God spake unto Moses as for this fellow we don't know from whence he is the man answered and said unto him why therein is a marvelous thing why why here in sorry is a marvelous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet Heath open mine eyes now we know that God heareth not Sinners and if any man be a worshiper of God and doeth his will he that heareth God I mean see he he God heareth Amen so it's the attitude they had the wrong attitude towards towards how the gift was wrapped you know David if you know if we look through the scripture David King David was was was God's gift to Israel in his time remember God always sends a gift right it's Christ manifested in the age we live okay so God uh David was God's gift to Israel he was a king after God's Own Heart that sounds like a gift from God to me I mean but you see Paul uh sorry Saul's attitude he could not accept that gift into his kingdom because he had an attitude of jealousy and hatred and we know on multiple times he tried to kill David and he made him a fugitive because he wasn't willing to surrender himself and his position to allow God's gift to take over amen and it was the same thing with the scribes Pharisees they they uh they did the same thing they even knew when when Nicodemus who was a ruler of the Jews came to came to Jesus by night he said we know you're a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him so they saw the effects of the gift but you see they were jealous they politically minded so they weren't willing to surrender to the gift to let the Lord Jesus take over because you see now naturally when we receive a gift we control the gift you get a phone you control the phone you get a bike you control the bike you get whatever you control it right but this gift is sent to control you am mean you become a love prisoner to Jesus Christ this this gift takes over your life you don't take over it but you see the scribes and Pharisees just like Saul they had a jealous nature so they didn't want to you know allow allow um you know allow it to rule even pilate realized that because for Envy which is jealousy they delivered Jesus to be crucified they were jealous of this man because they studied the word but yet this man would come didn't have any learning didn't have any Bible school education but made the word live cuz he was the word hallelujah see and when when you receive the GI God's gift you become the word go because the word comes and dwells in you amen amen see they were so concerned but you see this is what jealousy does jealousy causes you know it causes people to do crazy things to maintain a status quo just for a person or position or a party and this is what even the scribes and Pharisees they were jealous of Jesus but they were afraid that they would that that the Romans would come if people believed on him and take away both their place and nation and yet this gift of God they wanted to get rid of was the very thing they were looking for isn't that an amazing thing the very thing people look for people want to get rid of because of jealousy they want to keep the status quo this is how things have always been this is my position in the church this is how people think of me this is what my family thinks of me this is what my work Place thinks of me but what about receiving the gift God's Gift of eternal life I'd rather think of what God thinks of me more than what man thinks of me glory amen the Lord amen even even Jesus would say and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last day so you see this gift that see see God's gift we can see see he doesn't see he has seen but seeth tense am you say well where is where is Jesus with the nail scarred hands we don't see him in that form but we see him as his word right because remember the word in every age is Messiah amen so God's God's purpose or desire is that this is God's will that everyone would see the son which is the word and Believe on him that he that that may that they may have everlasting life that God will raise him up in the last day amen you say well this is so how we see him we see the Lord we see him as his word because he is his word we see him living in our day amen amen we see you know when we look in the mirror you should be able to see the Fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 God has literally turned my heart back to the faith of the fathers God has literally turned me back to believe I believe the whole Bible right you should literally be able to see Among Us Luke 17:30 the son of man being revealed brother Ram says that the son of man Jesus Christ is revealed in human beings amen not not just in a one man Ministry you say that was the prophet it was but that Ministry of the son of man continues on Amen so we should be able to see Jesus Christ in one another amen amen this is this is if you received God's Gift right we should see the word of God being a discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart and how often do we see that irrespective of who stands behind this Pulpit God's word speaking to people addressing conversations all these things what is it that's the word of God Discerning the thoughts and Tents of the heart we see these things yeah amen we see he is the same yesterday today and forever amen Hebrews 13:8 praise the Lord but you see so as many as received him gave you power to become the sons of God so this gift has power in it now I may be jumping back and forth a bit with this but you see see this gift is more than just yes I acknowledge Jesus but what's the effect of it in your life oh yes I believe God sent a prophet but what but what's the effect in your life should be a transforming power and I believe it is amen I believe I see it amen amen praise the Lord am amen now every gift is going to be opened by somebody right if I gave you a gift I would think you would open it yep I mean it's pretty normal what you think but there's after Christmas there's a lot of regifted gifts there's a lot of regifted gifts I think trade me and and Facebook Marketplace and whatever you know I think it becomes flooded with gifts that people don't want but it'll eventually get to someone that wants it that will receive it right and it's the same thing with our Lord you see cuz he came to his own but his own received him not so what happened I could say he got regifted now God knew who would receive him right he knew he knew the Jews would turn him down because they had to because remember when um Jacob was blessing the sons of Joseph Jacob's hands were crossed right so the blessing that should have gone to the older went to the younger so through the cross the blessings the Jews should have received came on you and I so we're the full beneficiaries of God's Gift Hallelujah so so so the Lord knew the Jews would turn him down because he knew he was going to take a gentile bride so he knew exactly who would receive this gift remember it's for everyone but he knows who's going to receive it he the Lord is not going to be surprised when you sit down at the wedding supper table he's not going to be shocked oh I didn't expect you here no I've been waiting for you I've been looking for you I've been I've been excited to see you come amen so you see things get regifted and eternal life has been regifted but it will eventually come to somebody and it did Hallelujah here we are amen you see it's like Jesus would give the parable of the invitation to the wedding suffer um suffer supper to his um you a king made a made a feast for his son sent out the invitation you know some said I've got a you know I bought some land I've got to go see it I bought some oxen or I married a wife they made excuses what they do they basically regifted their seat to someone else then he went to the highways Hedges wherever and you know people and they said basically um the king commanded his servants compel people to come someone's going to receive the gift amen and and praise God we're we were in the hges and the highways and the you know the unthought of places God God because God knew that you would receive his gift amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now those who those who receive uh the gift partially well actually let's just let's just remember as I said before this gift takes over us right it rules us okay we don't rule it amen but people who only receive parts of God's gift or actually want to rule it never ever get the full benefit of it okay so King Saul received parts of God's Gift David he and and and and he only received the parts of David that suited his own ends so he needed a giant killer God sent him David amen that was a part of God's Gift remember he was ano David was anointed king but Saul used him as a as a giant killer as a man to fight his battles as a worshipper to drive that evil spirit out of his life out of Saul's life so he used he used parts of parts of David but he did not receive the full benefits of having David in his kingdom as being his King I mean Simon the Pharisee invited invited the Lord Jesus to his Feast not to be have the head head head place at the feast but to make him a spectacle and leave him in the corner with unwashed feet amen the Roman soldiers received him just to Mock and crucify him amen see some receive him just to debate about him argue about him and tell them how much they don't believe in him remember he's the word that's what people do amen so sadly they ain't receiving God's wrapped gift in the way it should be received you see you know uh balum balum would would would use God's gift just for a money-making scheme now I'm not talking about any of us but I just want you to see we want to receive the full benefits of God's Gift okay so balum would use the gift of God in his life for a money-making scheme he had a genuine prophetic gift he was a prophet he knew the wrer to God in terms of sacrifice but he only did it to make money as ailing prophet and sadly believers who enter the ministry or follow the lord for only for material gain are sadly in the same bracket as balum some people become Believers well God you said if I follow you I'll get this or I'll become wealthy I'll get rich or I'll have a great family whatever more we don't follow God because of that we don't let this gift take over our lives because of something we can get out of it amen we're just happy we receed the gift God never promised promised us a flowery bed of East he never promised us an easy road but the road's worth it because of what's at the end of the road amen and he's on the road with you amen hallelujah so but you see Moses on the other hand isn't it amazing you know balam balam got bought out for the for for some riches from Moab but yet Moses because he really saw God's Gift he he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt so he had he had the whole bank account of the superpower of the age but he esteemed following Christ greater riches than that but yeah balum for a room full of silver sold out how many how many you know balum got sold out for just a small portion of what Moses could have had aren't you glad that that the Lord allowed us to weigh up whatever in the world Amen and and and it far was far outweighed by this gift of eternal life Judas only followed Jesus because he cared about the money he was a thief so so people will follow the lord for their own selfish gain some only followed for the Loaves and Fishes some people just like a free meal I like a free meal too food's good but you see I'll be honest I like food but you see that's not what that's not why we're Christians I mean we are not we are not message Believers because of a a free meal but you see it's amazing they followed him onto the other side of the sea just for another free meal they went a long way they were really serious in this getting a free meal but you see Jesus said you you did not come here because you saw the Miracles but because you ate the Loaves and the fishes so they had their own bellies as their interest for following so as I say sadly they were missing God's gift they got some benefits from it cuz everyone does you come into the presence of God you'll be benefited but but don't just let it be an external blessing let it come on on the inside of the inside I mean let it change you let it awaken your soul I mean let it live through you amen not just be an external blessing you know people will come to church cuz the people are nice and friendly or the worship is great or the atmosphere is amazing you know we had remember when we first started Church you know we had we had um was it um sister bronn's stepmom or potential stepmom at that time came to church and she said you know um she was from Sydney and she said you know we you know she's been in Hillsong she's been in the great big what what the world will call great big worship and there we were in this little place with a dripping ceiling and moldy it was a scary place it was it was you know it was the opposite of Hillsong the very polar opposite One keyboard and a guitar and she said I've never been in this kind of a presence before of the Lord you know people say they feel the love of God in the church the fellowship's great all those things are fine but there just benefits of being around the wrapping amen we should be like we should be like Simon Peter to whom to whom shall we go for thou alone has the words of eternal life me and we know and we believe that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God I mean when you can see that this message is more than just the wrapping of God into a prophet but eternal life being revealed amen you say to whom shall we go there's nowhere else to go Lord because you've revealed yourself through this word amen amen hallelujah amen I'll tell you Simon Peter went through a rugged road but he got God's Gift that's right he he got to a place where he allowed God's gift to take control of his life hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah but I'm so thankful that there's some that really really did receive God's Gift amen you look at you look at David's Mighty Men David's Mighty Men knew David was coming into Power David's Mighty Men knew he was anointed they look Beyond the Veil of a even like David's older brother would say to him when David came to the battle against Goliath you're just a naughty boy they could look Beyond now we know by this stage he was older than this he was a man he was mature but yet they could look Beyond the Veil of a fugitive of a of a man who is on the Run hated by his own King they could look beyond that wrapping and they could see this is God's anointed gift for my age and they gathered themselves to David and isn't it amazing you know they came discontented in debt and distressed but they didn't stay that way you you allow God's gift to take over your life and there'll be times of distress and discontent and debt but you won't stay that way amen God will transform you because remember they did not they did not start off as mighty men they came in this condition but because they could look beyond the wrapping and see God's Gift the anointing in the gift came upon them and they did Mighty exploits of Faith doing incredible Feats amen slaying many hundreds of enemies by themselves doing incredible things because the anointing in God's gift came into them and they became like the gift Hallelujah is it amazing you can look back in your life and you can see I'm becoming more like the Bible all the time can you see that in your life I trust you can you can see God you you're you're allowing me to trust you more depend upon you more rejoice in you more have more confidence in your word than ever before who's had that kind of a thing you look back and before you're like this but now you're more hey the trials are harder but there's a greater stability you think about the things that have come against you even recently if they came against you when you first met the Lord you would have been over right but God's God's allowed you to be shaken as you've gone along the roots have gone down into Christ more intertwined more deeper deeper deeper and now you can draw more water up you can draw more of his presence and his word up and you can have a greater confidence God I don't understand but I know you know the way amen because you are God's gift to me and I have full confidence though my mind says everything's going wrong my heart says something but your word says this is true and you're all right and I can trust in you I'm I'm Anchored In Your Word in spite of what's going on in here something in here says I've got a hold of you Hallelujah cuz you got think about a tree in a storm really you say well the roots are holding the Rock and the soil actually really the soil's holding on to the tree that's how I think about it anyway amen because the tree can have all the roots at once but it's got no soul to be and it's going to go down the hill amen praise the Lord see God's God's gift will always find a place some people it will it will search until there's somewhere to settle as I said regifting right but God has in his mind where it's going to end up even even when Joseph and Mary would come and they go to Bethlehem he was born in a manger cuz there's no room in the end here comes God's Gift into Bethlehem and and sadly well I guess he had to be born in a manger but you know imagine the opportunity if you really if you were that inkeeper sure you're stressed you got lots of guest is there's the there's meals and there's things you got to look after and all those things but Here Comes Here Comes Here Comes Mary and Joseph and Jesus Emmanuel is about to be born I think you'd make some room when you're in I think you'd upset some people to make them welcome now we know he had to be born in a manger but just for argument sake I think if really if you could look if they could have looked beyond uh Mary and Joseph and what they could see and see God's gift they would have made room and then even Jesus would say to the scribes and Pharisees he says you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you aren't you glad there's room in you for for his word hallelujah aren't you thankful for that amen that's why we love him because he's room in our hearts for his work amen there's a place where he can rest hallelujah amen now so I'm just trying to keep here with my notes a bit that's why it's so important we make room brother BR says what we need today is a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon Hearts that's humble we need a we need a real Christmas a birthplace if you could just realize you're nothing but a stable I'm nothing but a stable I mean God didn't go to Jerusalem or to Shiloh to ramoth Gilead he came to a stable that was polluted when you let God when you when you realize in yourself you're nothing but a stinking stable but welcome open your doors when these great big places and ends are turning him away open your doors of the manger of your heart and let Jehovah come in to that and watch what takes place for he is the word he said if you abide in me and I in you ask what you will I mean yeah let them come into you and watch what takes place then ask what you will and it'll be done for you now we know with gifts gifts have to be opened right there's not one gift really you you know when I was a child it didn't take long for that rapping to get off right cuz I wanted that gift my name was on it I wanted that gift gifts have to be open in order to release the gift inside now God's gift to us was open that down Calvary he was M more than any other man you think about rapping no I why I felt bad even last night trying to put this together thinking how can I Lord equate you just to rapping god with us Emmanuel amen but you see he was torn apart he was M more than any other man his boat uh his bones were all out of joint they pierced his side and his feet and his hands and you know all these things but you see God God allowed his gift to be opened hey Amen in order to release the gift inside and it came at great price but yet the but yet in that great moment amen the wrath of God was satisfied the Judgment of God that we should have received went upon God's Gift amen hallelujah amen the penalty for sin was paid that day amen so you and I can Embrace and receive and enjoy God's great gift of eternal life amen amen I tell you friends if youve really if you've really received that gift of eternal life your life will never be the same amen you'll become more than a religious person you'll become more than a person with a kind of an alternative lifestyle amen but it will transform your life amen like even with Solomon Solomon's age in the Bible because Solomon was a gift of God to to Israel at the time and they had a millennium because they rallied around that gift they rallied around God's Gift God God gave Solomon that Mighty gift of discernment and they rallied around it they had peace all around them am mean they had a they had it was a golden age for Israel because they rallied around that gift and brother bam says now what if we what if we now get because we know the gift the gift of God in this day is the Holy Ghost right what if we really rallied around it amen because this gift has come open amen the gift was open 2,000 years ago that we can look in and receive and partake and embrace this gift of eternal life now so what if we really embraced Embrace this gift of eternal life what if we really rallied around the Holy Ghost now I'm I'm not saying you're not but think about the power and what could happen if we really laid aside everything and embraced God's great gift to us am mean well we didn't just rally around what people did Generations ago of church splits and and doctrines and fussing and fighting and things of the past what if we just let that all go and just press to the mark of the High Calling of Christ I mean what if we what if we laid aside maybe the Troubles of this past year didn't rally around those memories those negative things and rallied around God's Gift of eternal life what if we laid aside hurt instead of rallying around hurt we red around God's Gift of eternal life what could really happen in our midst in our individual lives if we said Lord forgetting the things in the past see the Apostle Paul knew forget the things in the past leave them leave them there but rally around rally around the gift of eternal life you see this gift is God's quickening power it's more than an argument it's more than it's more than fussing or fighting or arguing about certain things you see when people receive gifts gifts change people amen you give a child a scooter for the first time or a bike for the first time they'll be doing things they never did before they receive that gift they'll be going places and they'll be going at speeds and they'll be getting injuries that they never could get without that gift amen amen because the gift changes them amen they begin to be adapted to the gift that they have received now how about now that's just a kid receiving a bike or a scooter How much more when eternal life comes in amen should that not change the places we go the things we do amen the things we talk about amen a kid without a scooter can't talk about scootering can't talk about trying to do tricks or you someone with a bike you can't talk about those things if you don't have the gift but when they have the gift the whole vocabulary changes am mean about what they can do and what they want to do and what the thing can do am mean now how about you and I friends when we receive the Holy Ghost amen this message of the hour the God's Gift of this day messiah in our manger of our hearts amen we will go places we never used to go we will do things we never used to do amen we will stop doing things we used to do like a kid with a bike who's going to walk that kid ain't going to walk hey I got a bike I biked I bike to school I don't walk anymore I Bike to School amen right so we'll travel in ways we never used to travel why because the gift has changed us hallelujah amen and so should should that not be with us this morning that God's Gift of eternal life that we have received and I pray if you haven't received it you will receive it that you look beyond the religion look beyond the wrapping amen amen but you'll be able to embrace you'll Embrace Jesus Christ the word and it will change you you'll think differently amen you'll act differently you'll speak differently you will your attitude will be different why because you've received the gift of eternal life am mean the Apostle Paul when he received God's WRA gift isn't it amazing the Apostle Paul wasn't looking for it he was trying to destroy it he was trying to rub out this he was trying to get rid of God's Gift of eternal life that's what he was was trying to do when he was persecuting the church but you see God's gift we don't go looking for it it comes looking for you amen so even this morning God's gift is looking for some people today amen maybe just even out on the streaming God's Gift of eternal life is looking for people I mean see God comes searching for us and when the Apostle Paul met the Lord on the road to Damascus he found a new way of life that completely changed what he knew and thought and did I mean the people he once hated he embraced hallelujah amen he used to drag them off into prison have such a burning hatred I'm going to destroy these people they're horrible people but then after the road to Damascus he I love these people I want to be around these people I'm identified with these people they are my people once the scribes and Pharisees were mine now these people are mine Hallelujah the places he hated became the places he loved I mean he hated the places Christians gathered he wanted to shut those places down but then after he received God's gift of eternal life right say after God's Gift of eternal life embraced him and changed him those places he hated became the places he loved amen the name he hated became the name he loved amen and he loved that name so much after he received that gift of Return of life he said it's a name above all names hallelujah amen I trust that's how you feel about him you see the the the name of Jesus Christ is more than just a debate point or a name of God or a nice idea it is the name above all names you see when you receive this name you when you receive the gift of eternal life you will realize it is the name above all names hallelujah amen his life all he did was completely different because why he received God's Gift of eternal life amen when the when the when the people of God were in the upper room they gathered they gathered no wait let's just go to this and maybe I'll leave that one there but you see now people who people who receed God's gift it changes our nature it changes our Outlook I'm just going to close with this thought see it matures us we go from glory to glory like David's Mighty Men they started off in debt and discontent and all these things but but but David after he became King on the throne he gave them leadership over cities you see this is when they Embrace God's Gift of etern life in their day I mean God placed them David placed them as kings over cities rulers over cities in Israel and it shows that when you really Embrace God's Gift of eternal life it's not just for now actually this is just training ground this is just a small thing but God is giving us character through you know as a victory not as a gift but as a victory through troubles and circumstances that when we're transported over to the other side of the into the Millennium what God gives us Dominion because we're going to rule and reign with Christ hallelujah amen I'm just going to abruptly stop right there but I want to ask you the question have you really received this God's Gift of eternal life or have you just received a Doctrine have you just received an argument or you know you just a religious person or have you really received him has he changed you like he did the Apostle Paul you you love him more than anything see when when you receive this God's Gift of eternal life it's like the pearl of great price it is the pearl of great price you're willing to sell everything that you just Embrace that Pearl and it changes your nature it changes your outlook it changes your attitude it changes your thoughts towards people it changes how you treat people how you treat yourself the things you do it changes every part of your life amen amen I trust it's done that for you today has he been born in the manger of your heart this is what Christmas is all about the world is doing what it's doing but maybe we have a different kind of a Christmas Even just in our hearts when we give gifts to one another give gifts to our family even family that don't even know the Lord maybe be like Lord when we place this gift in their hands may you somehow by your Supernatural presence may they see nail scars may they see eternal life wants to be given cuz really think about it when you gather around the table even when we come to church what's our heart's desire Lord he part eternal life Lord give your gift Lord may they may they have an open heart to receive your gift of eternal life Lord and when we go see our family go see work colleagues what is really our heart of hearts if we could give anything to anyone what would it be it would be him so may we this this Christmas season when we see family don't get caught up in the stresses and family politics and all the hurry and all the scurry and all those things going on May we not be caught up in that may we be caught up in Lord you know know my desire I want to give that person you Lord change their heart Lord that they will have room there's room in their manger that they can receive you and receive this gift of eternal life like I have should we be that way this Christmas let's be that way amen let's have the musicians please
