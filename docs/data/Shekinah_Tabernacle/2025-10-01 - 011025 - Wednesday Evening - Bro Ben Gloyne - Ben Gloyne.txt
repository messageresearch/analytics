And I thought this very fitting uh for brother Ka to finish on let the weak say I am strong cuz I want to just take a little thought before we approach the Lord's supper tonight uh about strength for the journey. Amen. So let's um let's just open the well you don't need to turn to this but I know everyone knows the scripture really well. Um but this is Acts chapter 2 and verses 38. We um I have this here so I just got to rearrange myself. Amen. Amen. So it says here this Peter preaching on the the first ever church service on the day of Pentecost. He's and and then well the previous verse says you know the people that heard him were pricked in their hearts said men and brethren what shall we do? So what shall we do to be saved? Then Peter said unto them,"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." Amen. So, let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight as we prepare our hearts. Amen. Let's let's pray together. Almighty God, we just want to say thank you, Lord. You're our strength. You're our sufficiency. You're our all and all. We've come this night, dear God, to remember your your allsufficient sacrifice, Lord. You're the perfect lamb. And we're so thankful that we can be partakers, Lord, of of your sacrifice because you did it on our behalf. And by grace, by faith, we've come to say thank you, Lord, for all you've done. So, Lord, as we uh just go through this service tonight, we do not come uh to do a ritual, Lord. who have come with thanksgiving our hearts to acknowledge that Lord it's by you Lord Jesus not by our ability it's by what you have done that we can walk this walk Lord and take Lord this journey all the way into glory so I pray you'd bless us tonight prepare our hearts Lord as we uh Lord approach the Lord's supper Lord as we call it and I pray our hearts would there'd be nothing between us and you Lord we commit our lives into your hands we plead your blood I plead your blood over us as a people father may have your way this night for your glory be with those who can't be here as wellord Lord, we lift them into your presence by prayer as well. In Jesus Christ's name, we commit ourselves into your hands. Amen. Amen. God bless you. So, you can have your seats uh tonight. So I want to speak just just as I was I was reading through the church age book again and and and um brother Brown was bringing this out in the in the Ephesian age but uh just just just the scripture and how how the church of Pentecost was the pattern was the example how how how how we should be and I just want to read this just just here and we're going to go back to uh what we read but it says now now thus the church was at Pentecost is the standard it is the pattern. There is no other pattern. No matter what the scholars say, God has not changed that pattern. What God did at Pentecost, he has to keep on doing until the church age is close. Though scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over, don't you believe it. Such a statement is wrong on two counts. First of all, it is wrong to suppose that there aren't any more apostles just because the original 12 are dead. An apostle means a sent one. And there are many sent ones today, but they are called missionaries. As long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life, there is an apostolic age going on. Secondly, they refer to an age of manifested Holy Ghost power as being over since the Bible has been completed. This is untrue. There is not even one scripture that suggests that, but many conclusively state otherwise. Here is our proof that both of these charges are false. Acts 238:39. Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sin, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." The promise of power with which the apostles were endued at Pentecost, is to you Jews, to your children Jews, and to all that are far off Gentiles, and to as many as the Lord our God shall call, both Jew and Gentile, until he stops calling, the Pentecostal message and power will not cease. Now to me when the Lord you when Peter is saying to as many as the Lord our God shall call we think well where are they being called to okay because this scripture many times we just take it as a as a salvation scripture and it is it's the it's the door into heaven and it's God's provided way and God has not changed with his provided way but it's more than just a initial salvation then it's kind of you put that to one side and you keep walking on because Where were you being called to? See, you weren't called to a church. You weren't called to a religion. You weren't called to a tradition or an idea. No, you're called to a place. And that place, as I said, is not a church, but it's it's to glory. Amen. You This calls me as the Lord of God shall call. I was thinking, where's he calling from? I mean, he's not calling from the synagogue. He's not calling from an earthly world. He's calling from that other world, from heaven itself. And there's a call has gone out. Come. You want to come? &gt;&gt; I know. Yeah. This is I'm glad someone wants to come. Praise the Lord. But you see, there's a call. It's like, you know, if you're in your house and you're calling to your children or to someone for them to come where you are, they hear your voice and then they obey your voice. Sometimes it takes a bit longer, but eventually they do. And then, you know, then they get up from what they're doing. They stop what they're doing and they start walking where the voice is calling them. And then finally they hear your voice. They respond. They begin to walk. Then eventually they come into your presence where you are. Right? And now to me as many as the Lord I got shall call is he's calling us into glory. Praise the Lord. I know this is probably very elementary but it made me happy. So I'm going to be happy tonight. Amen. So as many as the Lord our God call. So, so his voice has been sent to the earth and there's something in us that's been pricricked saying what can I do? When you first heard this message, I trust something moved in you saying this is different. I realize my religion didn't cut it. You know that I need more than just a religion. I need the reality. I need God himself. And it and it was a call. It was a call to a union. It was a call to a rapture. It was a call to a body change. It was call it was a call to your place at the wedding supper table. And so now if that call has gone out which it has and it's and it's to move us from this world to the next world then if that call has been made then God has given power that we can fulfill that call that we can end up in our end destination. Amen. There's see that's why I read that that's why it blessed me. The Pentecostal messaging power will not cease as long as God is calling to you and I supernaturally. Not just a blanket call, but to a bridegroom call, as brother Ramon says it, to a to a wedding, to a union. There's a call. And so, if there's a call, then God will supply and has supplied the ability and the energy and the strength and the determination and the perseverance to follow that call all the way to the end. Amen. And that end is not halfway between here and there. That end is not disappointment. Though sometimes we end up in disappointing circumstances, we end up because remember this walk is a rugged walk. It's not an easy walk. It's not a picnic. It's not a just a gentle stroll on a nice summer's day and everything's fine and dandy. It can be a very rugged time. Sometimes we have those nice times, but but the strength of this call is really shown when when you go through difficult circumstances. Amen. Because that's when because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. So this call actually puts faith in you. Who heard the word then you begin to believe. What happened? Faith was deposited. And now that faith comes to maturity and is tested to prove that it's faith. Amen. So it's not always the easy times. It's in the difficult times when the when the power of the call, if I can put it that way, is really proven because God knows it works. It worked in Enoch's day before Calvary. It worked in Elijah's day. That was before Calvary as well. It sure works after Calvary. Amen. Because of the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. It's like Jesus would say, "Let not your hearts be troubled. Ye believe in God. Believe also on me in my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I'll come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. So he's saying, where I am, not where you are. See? See, the call comes to us just like someone in a house you're calling to or someone across the office or somewhere. They hear your voice, they respond to it, and they come to where you are. Praise the Lord. Now, I I I'm sure that we we're very much aware that the reason we're believers is because of his grace, his strength, his ability. Amen. When you want to quit, there's something in you says you can't quit. Amen. There's something in you that says when you want to just throw up your hands and say, "What's the point?" Discouragement comes, you know, difficult times come, maybe questions, maybe gets foggy, you know, you can't really see the way. there's something in you says keep walking &gt;&gt; and and why because the because you know brother Ram says there's three pulls. Okay. And the third pull is actually the bride being pulled to Christ and it's a it's a it's a force that's drawn you. We live in a supernatural time. &gt;&gt; We live in a very supernatural time. But that third pull has actually called you to himself. I mean, you're not called to to just because the miracles are done, though they are, or the thoughts of the heart are revealed, though they are. But no, it's the word Christ becoming open as that voice has come to you and something in you says, "I'm going to follow that voice." And you can't work it out necessarily. You can't put it all together. When I first heard, Brother Brham, I had no idea there was a message. I had no idea that he was a fulfillment of Malachi 4. I had no idea that the rapture was coming. I had no idea about that. But something the the voice behind his voice, I heard a call and something moved in me to say I want to start following that call. But I had to come to a point of full surrender and giving my life to obey the call. Cuz it's like when you, you know, when your kids call you or when you call your children, either one, they have to surrender to the call to come to where you are. It's the same thing. We have we have given our all. We've heard that call. Who's heard that call? You can't necessarily put it in words or really describe what it did, but you know that it's something's gripped you and it's not religion. It's not something that's trending. It's not it's not a nice idea or what everyone else is doing. It's certainly not popular culture. I mean, it's totally really against the grain, but it gripped you. And you can see and as you're walking, God is proving that word over and over again. Praise the Lord. Now our Lord Jesus has paved the way and he gives abundant grace to the responder of his word. Aren't you glad? It's grace. It's divine influence. Now I'm going to read this psalm. I won't be too long, but uh it says to the chief musician unto GitHal for the sons of Kora. How amniable are thy tabernacles, oh Lord of hosts. My soul longeth, yay, even faintth for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh crith out for the living God. Yeah, the sparrow hath found in house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, oh Lord of hosts, my king and my God. Blessed are they that dwell in thine house. They will uh they will be still praising thee, sealer. Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee. In whose heart are the ways of them, who passing through the valley of Becca, make it a well. The rain also fillth the pools. They go from strength to strength. Every one of them in Zion appearth before God. And you may not feel stronger, but you've been going from strength to strength. Amen. You've been taking mountains. You've been casting out devils. You've been taking land promises. You say, "Well, I don't feel very strong." Well, his strength is known in perfect weakness. Amen. But we've been going from the believers going from strength to strength. Imagine if we you were just a brand new Christian and maybe the things you're facing now or just overcome faced you back then. May have been too much. God knows what we can handle. Even even Israel uh Moses led them a God told them to go a certain way, you know, towards the promised land because he said if they go basically a direct path, the warfare will be too great. They need to go the the scenic tour because they need to go from strength to strength. Oh Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer. Give ear, oh God of Jacob, sealer. Behold, oh God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. For the Lord God is a son and shield. The Lord will give grace and glory. No God no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. Oh Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. Now I just want to read this. This is from Charles Spurgeon. I hope that's okay. I open my Bible app and and a commentary comes up and I thought this is really nice. He says, "Bounteous is Jehovah in his nature to give in his delight. His gifts are beyond measure precious and are as freely given as the light of the sun. He gives grace to his elect because he wills it. To his redeemed because of his covenant, to the called because of his promise, to believers because they seek it, to sinners because they need it. He gives grace abundantly, seasonably, I mean seasonably, constantly, readily, sovereignly, doubly enhance the value of the boon of the manner of the bestowal. Grace in all its forms he freely renders to his people. Amen. Praise the Lord. Comforting, persevering, sanctifying, directing, instructing, assisting. Grace, he generously pours into their souls without ceasing. And he always will do so. Whatsoever may occur. Sickness may befall, but the Lord will give grace. Poverty may happen to us, but grace will surely be afforded. Death must come, but grace will light a candle at the darkest hour. Reader, how blessed it is as years roll round, and the leaves begin to fall. To enjoy such unfading promises this, the Lord will give grace. The little conjunction and in this verse is a diamond rivet binding the present with the future. Grace and glory always go together. God has married them and none can divorce them. God will never deny a soul glory to whom he is freely given to life upon his grace. Indeed, glory is nothing more than grace in its Sabbath dress. Grace in full bloom, grace like autumn fruit, mellow and perfected. How soon um how soon we may have glory, none can tell. And maybe before this month of October has run out, we shall see the holy city. But at the interval longer or shorter, we shall be glorified earong. glory, the glory of heaven, the glory of eternity, the glory of Jesus, the glory of the father, the Lord will surely give to his chosen. Oh rare promise of a faithful God. Amen. So I put that in there because one, I liked it, but two, it shows he freely supplies every need. Amen. You may feel weak, he'll give you strength. You may feel distressed, he gives you comfort. Amen. You may feel like you don't know where to place the next step. He guides your steps. Amen. You may be sick, he'll heal you. Amen. You may be troubled, he'll console you. See, he gives you strength because remember the call is not just a call to salvation as I read Acts chapter 2, but that call is all the way to adoption, to the body change, the rapture, to the wedding supper in the sky, to eternity rolling on when the devil and everything's no more. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we can we can we can stand like Caleb and say, "I'm as strong now as I was the day I left Egypt." Amen. Give me this mountain. Why? Because he went by the strength of Almighty God. It wasn't his natural strength or his tenacity, you know, of human ability that made him that strong. No. Oh, no. It was because when he walked out of Egypt, he ate the blood of the lamb. Amen. that that the life was given for his house and he walked out in the strength of the lamb and because of revelation because of that lamb he conquered that mountain at 84 years old. Amen. That you you know the giants were there all the big hindrances were there but because of the strength of the Lord he took it. Amen. And it's the same thing with us. We walk because by him. Amen. I mean, if you think it's you being a Christian, you're going to fall on your face and be sorely disappointed, right? If you think it's your human ability, all it is is our surrender and then then he pours his strength in. Amen. And he has gone on before, he has already conquered all things. So, whatever you're going through uh at this very moment in your life, when you when you take of the Lord's supper, remember, just just have it in your heart. Lord, you've already conquered. You've already conquered my sickness, my trouble, whatever I'm going through. Maybe you feel down, depressed, I don't know, whatever. Whatever's fighting against you, our God has conquered and he's conquered in a mighty way. Amen. As he's called the royal seed of Abraham. Now, this is brother Brand in and possess uh possessing the gates of the enemy after trial. The royal seed of Abraham. Now, the natural seed could not point to that. But the royal seed can conquer already conquered. He has gone before us and conquered the gate for us. Amen. He is now after 2,000 years, he stands in the midst of us, the mighty conqueror. Not only did he conquer sickness, he conquered sickness. He conquered temptation. He conquered every enemy. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave and rose up again. And 2,000 years later, here he stands among us this afternoon identifying himself the mighty conqueror. Amen. He is still here alive vindicating his promise. The royal seed of Abraham. Oh my. He is here proving his word. Amen. To show you that the call you first responded to is a call all the way up into glory. And he will strengthen your steps until that day when our bodies are changed and he takes us all home. So take courage, dear Christian. Amen. God is on the scene and he has poured out his abundant grace. What was the cry when the headstone the capstone came down was shouting grace grace unto it. Amen. And this is the season where that capstone of divine love has come down upon the bride of Jesus Christ. So we don't cry out our own ability or look what we've done. No we shout grace grace. Amen. A divine influence has been magnified like never before. I say the full strength of the of Calvary is in manifestation in this day. Amen. And we happen to be blessed enough by the grace of God to be able to partake of his allsufficient sacrifice. Amen. That we can walk victorious in every circumstance. Because remember, the God that called you is not going to leave you. &gt;&gt; He's going to take you all the way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, let's um can we have the deacons, please, tonight? I didn't want to be too long, but I just want to let's I just I just want to encourage you. God is more than able. Whatever you're going through, don't despair. Don't be discouraged. Amen. No, God is more than able. Amen. Yeah. Please bring it over here. Amen. Let's all stand. Amen. Because you think what what amazing what incredible price the Lord Jesus put. He paid the ultimate price that day on Calvary where he poured out his life without measure. I just want to hold something up. Sorry. Christine pointed this out. Sorry, honey. I'm going to I'm going to drag you into this. This is a bear. Okay. Yeah, it's a bear. Remember what brother Chris Mitch preached a few years ago? It's bear season. &gt;&gt; Amen. So So it's open season on whatever enemy's roaming in your ground. You have a right to take your sword or take your gun, whatever weapon you got. Slingshot, kill the thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And but how do we do it? By the sacrifice of Calvary, by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, by the Holy Ghost living in us. Amen. The enemy must be under our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, amen. We thank the Lord for all he's done. Amen. So, let's just bow our heads, shall we? Just I just pray this will be a real sacred moment because you got to think, Lord, you know, when we get there, we'll say, Lord, it was all you. &gt;&gt; It was all you, Lord. You found me. You kept me. You've brought me here. You put it in me to respond to your call. It wasn't my human ability. It was something in me that said yes. Amen. So it so it's all him. Amen. So let's just bow heads. Let's pray. Amen. Gracious heavenly father, almighty God, as we stand here tonight Lord, we are so thankful Lord that we can Lord partake Lord Jesus of this of this unleaven bread that represents your body. Lord I pray you would bless it my God. Father, as you stood there, Lord, at the um at that Passover, Lord, the last one you'd have with your disciples, you said you longing to have that with them, Lord Jesus, because now was this time when you would you would be offered, Lord, as our sacrifice, Lord, is the uh John the Baptist said, "Behold the lamb of God that would take away that takes away the sin of the world, Lord. You're about to do it, Lord." Few hours after that moment, dear God, and you took the bread and you and you broke it and you blessed it, said, "This is my body which is given. Do this in remembrance of me. So, Father, as we partake of this unleavened bread, Lord, we think of your body that was marred more than any other man. Lord, you were wounded for our transgressions. The chastisement of our peace was upon you. You were bruised for our iniquities, Lord. But by your stripes, we're healed. So, Father, I pray, dear God, if there's anyone sick here, Lord, that would partake of the bread and the wine, Lord, which represents your blood, your life, that you poured out without measure in completeness. Lord, you were more than just wounded. You gave your life, but you said, "If I lay my life down, I'll pick it back up again." Lord, you gave your life as a total ransom for us, my God. Lord, you purchased our salvation completely that that day on Calvary. And Lord, we're so thankful that we are partakers of your divine grace, Lord Jesus, that we've become one with our sacrifice, my God. Lord, as we uh Lord, as everyone who comes and stands here and partakes of the bread and the wine, Lord Jesus, they are they are they are a living testimony showing that they are be they have become one with you, Lord, as they become one with this bread and wine representing your your body and your blood. So, I pray you'd bless this wine, Lord, that represents your blood. You you'd bless this bless this bread which represents your body. And Father, we just want to just pray you'd purify our hearts. Forgive us any sin, Lord. I pray for everyone here, Lord. Just may may there be nothing between us and you. And dear God, we also especially want to remember those who are sick and body who can be here tonight. Lord, brother Phil comes to mind, Lord Jesus. Pray you touch them, my God. May you raise them up for your glory, Lord. Anyone else, Lord, who's unwell in body, Father. May you be their abundant portion. So, dear God, we commit this time into your hands. We thank you so much, Lord, for this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats and you just you just come up when you're ready. As the Bible says, carry one for another and let a let a man examine himself before he partakes. Amen. [Music] No matter what I see, no matter what I feel, no matter what I hear, I believe. No matter what I'm told, no matter how it seems, no matter what it cost, I believe. And if I look and it seems like it's broken, [Music] I'll lay a hallelu on the altar.
