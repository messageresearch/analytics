[40:26] israel and hit them and said thus there
[40:28] came men unto me but i wish not whence
[40:30] they were and it came to pass about the
[40:32] time of the shutting of the gate when it
[40:34] was dark that the men went out whether
[40:35] the men went i what not pursue after
[40:38] them quickly for ye shall overtake them
[40:41] but she had brought them up to um up to
[40:43] the roof of the house and hid them with
[40:44] the stalks of flax which she had laid in
[40:47] order upon the roof and the men pursued
[40:50] after them the way to jordan unto the
[40:51] fords and as soon as they uh which
[40:54] pursued after them had gone out they
[40:56] shut the gate and before they were laid
[40:58] down she came up unto them upon the roof
[41:00] and she said unto them she said unto the
[41:03] men now notice this i know that the lord
[41:05] has given you the land
[41:07] and that your terror has fallen upon us
[41:10] this is very important
[41:11] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[41:13] faint because of you

[41:17] the water of the red sea for you when

[41:20] came up out of egypt and what ye did
[41:23] unto the two kings the amorites that
[41:25] were on the other side of jordan see hon
[41:27] and og whom he utterly destroyed
[41:30] and as soon as we heard these things our
[41:32] hearts did melt neither did there remain

[42:59] amen god bless you friends you may have
[43:01] your seats this morning i'd like to
[43:03] speak about the devil's mental health
[43:05] crisis
[43:07] it's the devil's mental health crisis
[43:09] okay i want to speak about that because
[43:11] he's going through a big mental health
[43:12] crisis right now and this is not to gain
[43:14] him give him sympathy not to give him
[43:16] any i feel i don't feel sorry for him he
[43:19] can have all the blood pressure he can
[43:20] have all the heart attacks he can have
[43:22] all the fainting spells and the anxiety
[43:24] problems and panic attacks he can have
[43:26] it all and times it by a million law
[43:28] just pour it on i mean because it's his
[43:30] own fault but so you know
[43:32] it's really important
[43:34] to know the morale of the enemy in a war
[43:38] it's very important if you know the
[43:39] morale of the enemy amen it's very
[43:41] important to know amen because you know
[43:44] you may look at them and on the outside
[43:46] they may have their guns ready their
[43:47] weapons shining they can be in their
[43:49] formations their bunkers whatever have
[43:51] all their men and their tanks and their
[43:52] bombs and their guns but it's on the
[43:54] inside of the man
[43:55] what's going on in the heart of the
[43:57] soldier which what really matters i mean
[44:00] so it's very important to know the
[44:02] morale of the of of the opposing force
[44:04] you know if the if the enemy's got a
[44:06] good morale well i guess the battle is
[44:08] gonna be a bit harder but we're gonna
[44:09] win
[44:10] right amen hey we've got total victory
[44:12] victory sure right but if we know that
[44:14] the that the enemy is broken his heart
[44:17] is melted he has no more courage amen
[44:20] that he's just nothing but a bluff amen
[44:21] we know we're going to win even the more
[44:23] hallelujah because you know it's not
[44:25] it's not it doesn't matter how numerous
[44:27] he is how great his equipment is what
[44:29] his bows are how great he says his
[44:31] missiles are i'm just typing the natural
[44:33] with the spiritual you know the enemy
[44:35] can stand up and say i've got a weapon
[44:37] with one weapon i can wipe out the
[44:38] entire northern hemisphere you know they
[44:40] can make their make their boats make
[44:42] their claims how numerous they are
[44:44] but doesn't matter how much noise he
[44:46] makes all of us propaganda what he tells
[44:48] you he's bluffing
[44:50] he's nothing but a bluff and the devil
[44:52] is nothing but a bluff right now
[44:55] amen see he see see see but even though
[44:58] he's bluffing we're still called to
[45:00] fight
[45:01] i'm in the battle maybe the lord say
[45:03] amen but he he wants us to come to the
[45:04] battle yes lord amen
[45:07] now we've got to understand we're not
[45:08] fighting a natural foe
[45:10] right but we're fighting i mean you know
[45:12] so we're not fighting our least favorite
[45:14] political party
[45:15] or any any kind of movement we're not
[45:17] fighting flesh and blood i mean but
[45:19] we're fighting against spiritual powers
[45:21] in high places we're fighting as demon
[45:23] spirits this is what we're fighting
[45:24] against in this hour right it's not
[45:26] against flesh and blood not against some
[45:28] people it's against spirit
[45:30] right now the devil
[45:32] wants us to
[45:33] think his thoughts he wants us to act
[45:36] according to him he wants us to feel how
[45:38] he feels that's what an anointing does
[45:41] amen when you feel the anointing of god
[45:43] you feel faith you feel love you feel
[45:45] joy it comes to pulsate through your
[45:47] being because god is anointing you to
[45:49] believe his word and if you take the
[45:51] contrary to that the devil puts unbelief
[45:53] he puts doubt he puts questions he puts
[45:55] reason against the word of god because
[45:57] that's how he feels
[45:58] and he's trying to get you to agree with
[46:00] him
[46:01] amen so he's nothing but a bluff
[46:05] now we read there we read that the that
[46:08] the enemy
[46:09] had fainted they had no more strength
[46:12] because of the people of god now what an
[46:14] incredible encouragement that would have
[46:16] been to joshua where joshua you know
[46:18] moses had been taken off the scene you
[46:20] know god already told told joshua and
[46:22] joshua chapter one moses my servant is
[46:24] dead you know you go over jordan and
[46:26] possess the land and and so god had
[46:28] commissioned joshua this is your job
[46:30] you're going to take the people across
[46:31] this jordan you're going to put them in
[46:33] the promised land and he says i'll never
[46:35] leave you nor forsake me i'll be with
[46:37] you but be strong and very courageous
[46:39] and it's a what a report it would have
[46:40] been when these two spies came back from
[46:42] jericho and they because remember rahab
[46:45] was now revealing to israel this is
[46:47] what's really in the heart of the men so
[46:49] basically she is telling them don't look
[46:51] at the walls don't look because remember
[46:54] they would have had their helmets on
[46:55] their shields their you know their armor
[46:57] their spears or their bows they would
[46:58] have been around the walls they would
[47:00] have been ready for a fight but in them
[47:01] there was no fight
[47:02] right so outwardly it looked like they
[47:04] were going to fight but in them they
[47:05] they had no fights
[47:07] their courage had gone their hearts had
[47:09] melted i mean why because a covenant
[47:11] people of god were coming into the land
[47:14] to possess your inheritance amen they
[47:16] were coming into the promise that god
[47:17] had given them saying i've given you
[47:19] this land you're going to go possess
[47:20] this land this is the promised word for
[47:22] your life and you're going to fulfill it
[47:25] so here they were crossing crossing
[47:26] jordan and what an incredible joy you
[47:29] know joshua would have had his dancing
[47:31] shoes on
[47:32] hallelujah because he had known god was
[47:34] for them but then he realized that the
[47:36] same god was with them actually the
[47:38] terror of the lord had fallen upon the
[47:40] enemy and now that enemy was done
[47:43] hallelujah
[47:45] amen so what an encouragement that would
[47:46] have would have been for joshua now if
[47:48] we could really look into the heart of
[47:49] the devil right now we would see that
[47:51] the same the same
[47:54] uh lack of courage in these enemy
[47:56] soldiers you know their hearts being
[47:57] melted all their courage had gone that's
[47:59] in the enemy
[48:00] he's nothing but a bluff right but
[48:03] that's how he really is if he would
[48:04] stand here and tell the truth to say
[48:06] this is the morale of the opposing force
[48:08] that you're fighting we're done we're
[48:10] shot
[48:12] we're in big trouble
[48:14] amen
[48:16] hallelujah so we need to
[48:19] come to the battle but we're here to
[48:21] fight the battle and win the battle
[48:23] now we're going to get to the devil's
[48:24] mental health state
[48:26] it's not a good state
[48:27] we're going to get to it but then he
[48:29] wants to put that state upon you
[48:31] and you need to realize actually i have
[48:33] no part of him he has no part in me so
[48:35] why should i feel the way he feels i
[48:37] think think the way he thinks act the
[48:39] way he acts you know it's not my portion
[48:42] that's where we're going if in case
[48:43] you're wondering so
[48:45] we're told in ephesians 6 finally my
[48:47] brethren be strong in the lord and the
[48:49] power of his might put on the whole
[48:50] armor of god that you may be able to
[48:52] stand against the wiles of the devil for
[48:54] you wrestle not against flesh and blood
[48:56] but against principalities against
[48:58] powers against the rulers of the
[48:59] darkness of this world against spiritual
[49:01] wickedness in high places
[49:03] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[49:05] of god that you may be able to withstand
[49:07] the evil day and having done all to
[49:09] stand
[49:10] stand therefore having your loins good
[49:12] about with truth and having on the
[49:14] breastplate of righteousness and your
[49:16] feet shod with the preparation of the
[49:17] gospel of peace above all taking the
[49:19] shield of faith whether you're able to
[49:21] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[49:23] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[49:25] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[49:27] god praying always with all prayer and
[49:29] supplication in the spirit and watching
[49:31] there unto with all perseverance and
[49:34] supplication for all saints
[49:37] now we know that they that the peoples
[49:40] of the promised land that were just
[49:41] squatters there they didn't just migrate
[49:43] because god told abraham that his seed
[49:45] is going to come back here after 400
[49:47] years and so yo dwell in the land
[49:49] but but the devil inspired them to build
[49:51] big cities train big armies because the
[49:53] devil was actually preparing for a fight
[49:56] because the devil's been fighting since
[49:58] before time against the word of god
[50:01] he has been fighting to stop it being
[50:03] fulfilled that's his job that's what he
[50:05] tries to do but we got to realize he
[50:08] can't stop it
[50:09] he cannot stop prophecy being fulfilled
[50:11] he cannot stop god's children coming to
[50:13] their previous day position he cannot
[50:16] stop it he cannot stop you he cannot
[50:18] stop god amen because the scripture says
[50:21] if the lord before us who could be
[50:22] against us
[50:24] amen so now they didn't just quit they
[50:26] resisted and fought but they had no
[50:29] strength they had no courage
[50:31] and the reason that they lost all the
[50:32] courage is because they heard about
[50:34] their buddies in egypt being drowned in
[50:35] the red sea so the devils that were in
[50:37] the promised land were now panicking and
[50:40] and and the terror of god fell upon them
[50:42] because the devils that were upon the
[50:44] children of israel is cruel task masters
[50:46] amen those egyptians they were destroyed
[50:49] so it's the same thing now we were we
[50:51] were in in in the world you call egypt
[50:54] you know we walked a coin the prince of
[50:55] the power of the year right in ephesians
[50:57] 2 so that so the devil had rule over our
[50:59] life he's a cruel task master
[51:01] he never give us a day off he never gave
[51:03] us a holiday never gave us a nice time
[51:06] he's mean
[51:07] he would he would he would trick us into
[51:08] all kinds of things but then we'd wake
[51:10] up with regret and anxiety and why did i
[51:12] do this and i can't believe i said that
[51:14] and you know i can't believe i you know
[51:16] and you know and we we're just in cruel
[51:18] bondage but then you begin to call upon
[51:20] god like israel called upon god in egypt
[51:22] and god sent deliverance their way
[51:24] hallelujah and then it's the same thing
[51:26] with us we call upon the lord he says
[51:28] i'm going to call you out of egypt
[51:30] i'm going to take you out of this place
[51:32] and he takes us through just like israel
[51:34] was taken through the red sea and all of
[51:36] their task masters drowned in the red
[51:37] sea it's the same with unbelief and
[51:39] demon powers that used to beat us down
[51:42] and caused us trouble when we went
[51:43] through the blood of jesus christ we
[51:45] looked behind and those things were
[51:46] drowned i mean when those demon spirits
[51:48] were drowned in the blood of jesus
[51:49] christ they couldn't follow you
[51:51] i mean why because they can't come
[51:53] through the blood like you can come
[51:54] through the blood so we can look back
[51:56] and we can stay on the other side of the
[51:58] red sea and shout and rejoice and say
[52:00] that pride devil's dead
[52:02] i mean that unbelief devil's dead amen
[52:04] that you're that anxiety whatever it is
[52:06] that pride that unforgiveness that
[52:08] stubborn spirit that's gone i mean he's
[52:10] face down in the blood of jesus christ
[52:12] he's dead
[52:14] hallelujah and what does that do to the
[52:16] rest of the devils that are trying to
[52:17] withstand you it makes their morale go
[52:20] because it says when we heard of this
[52:22] when we heard of what god did at the red
[52:24] sea
[52:25] all of our hearts went our courage was
[52:27] gone
[52:28] the terror of the lord came upon us
[52:30] because of you why did they why did they
[52:32] panic and get that terror because god's
[52:34] children walked in
[52:37] here i am
[52:38] hallelujah and it makes the devil shake
[52:40] in his boots
[52:43] hallelujah
[52:45] amen that's why their courage went they
[52:47] had no strength for war no more because
[52:49] their buddies in egypt were killed and
[52:52] those same people were coming their way
[52:54] they were on collision course
[52:56] hallelujah
[52:57] and it's always the bigger force wins
[53:00] amen it's the same thing with you and i
[53:02] we're
[53:03] we're on our way to canaan's fair land
[53:05] we're on our way into a millennium we're
[53:06] on our way into a rapture into a body
[53:08] change that's our way and and we're in
[53:11] collision course with the devil and his
[53:12] fortifications i said it's just going to
[53:14] be like this
[53:17] hallelujah and we're going to keep
[53:18] moving on
[53:19] hallelujah through prayer and
[53:20] supplication being surrendered to the
[53:22] word of god we're going to take every
[53:23] mountain we're going to take every
[53:25] promise
[53:26] amen every promise is ours by right just
[53:29] like the land was theirs by right god
[53:31] gave it to them it wasn't them that gave
[53:33] it to them god gave it to them it's the
[53:35] same thing with every promise in the
[53:36] word god god has given it to you by the
[53:38] blood of jesus christ it's yours by
[53:40] right hallelujah it's not the devils
[53:43] it's yours
[53:44] i mean every divine promise is yours
[53:47] hallelujah and and that just brings us
[53:49] on a collision course with satan because
[53:51] satan says that's not for you
[53:53] the joy of the holy ghost is not for you
[53:55] the holy ghost is not for you to be free
[53:57] is not for you you've just got to think
[53:59] the same kind of way for the rest of
[54:00] your life who says
[54:02] you'll never be happy who said
[54:04] that's the devil trying to keep you off
[54:06] the mountain of joy
[54:07] hallelujah yo that's just the devil
[54:09] trying to stop you getting your promises
[54:13] amen he you know he says oh god don't
[54:15] move like that anymore who said
[54:17] you read the book of acts oh that's all
[54:19] you know that's because that was back
[54:20] then and society's changed and now
[54:22] there's is everywhere and god don't move
[54:24] like that who said
[54:26] who said
[54:27] oh that was just brother branham's day
[54:28] who said
[54:30] that's the devil trying to stop you
[54:31] walking in every divine promise to see
[54:33] the reality of the word not just an
[54:35] argument remember this message is not an
[54:37] argument this message is a resurrected
[54:39] power i mean we can say that jesus rose
[54:41] from the grave because we see him walk
[54:43] among us his spirit touching lives
[54:45] transforming people's hearts we see it
[54:47] do we not we say his word put on flesh
[54:49] what's that that is jesus walking
[54:50] through
[54:51] amen so it's not an argument no it's a
[54:53] resurrected life it's jesus christ
[54:55] himself
[54:56] hallelujah but the devil try and push it
[54:58] back and put up scarecrows no no no
[55:00] there's there's food on the scarecrows
[55:03] amen the devil is trying to tell you
[55:05] it's not for you who said
[55:06] he says it's not for you because it's
[55:08] not for him
[55:09] so he tries to put his experience upon
[55:12] you i trust if that's all you get in the
[55:14] service i trust that's what you get
[55:16] because remember he can't be saved so he
[55:18] says you can't be saved
[55:20] he says you've gone too far it's because
[55:22] he's already gone too far
[55:24] and there's no blood for him anyway to
[55:25] be redeemed but he but he's crossed the
[55:27] line he fell from his first estate and
[55:28] he's done
[55:30] he says he says your losses because he's
[55:32] lost amen right he says you can't
[55:35] overcome because he can't overcome
[55:37] he tries to put his own experience upon
[55:39] you but if you agree with him his
[55:42] experience becomes your experience
[55:44] you know there's nothing in church
[55:46] that's because there's nothing in church
[55:47] for him
[55:48] right this word wasn't firm it's for
[55:50] believers
[55:51] he's an unbeliever he's a make-believe
[55:53] but he's not a believer
[55:54] right oh there's no rapture that's
[55:56] because there's no rapture for him
[55:58] right there's no there's no new body
[56:00] worse because there's not one for him so
[56:02] he'll try and take his experience and
[56:04] put it upon you and try and get you to
[56:06] agree with him
[56:08] we're not meant to do that
[56:10] here's why you've got to discern
[56:12] well no one loves you it's because no
[56:13] one loves him because he can't love
[56:15] no one cares for him well no because he
[56:17] doesn't care for anyone
[56:19] right you got to take
[56:21] he tries to always put his experience
[56:23] upon you
[56:26] sure now the big difference between
[56:28] israel and the rest of the nations is
[56:29] because god made a covenant with them
[56:32] abraham brother ramsey was like any
[56:33] other ordinary man but god called him
[56:35] that made the difference amen amen it's
[56:36] the same thing with with you and i we're
[56:38] just ordinary people but then god called
[56:40] us
[56:41] that makes a difference amen abraham was
[56:43] like anyone else there but then god
[56:45] called him and he said he said walk with
[56:47] me he began to walk
[56:48] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[56:50] us god called it god's called you god's
[56:52] called you
[56:53] he hasn't called you just to lead you
[56:55] somewhere and leave you no he called you
[56:56] to keep you he saves you to keep you
[56:58] he's going to take you all the way
[56:59] through
[57:00] amen he called you for a purpose
[57:03] and it wasn't for you to die in the
[57:05] wilderness or you know no you're going
[57:06] to go into your inheritance you know the
[57:08] fullness of the body change who believes
[57:10] that
[57:11] i'm not here for a part-time kind of
[57:13] christianity i'm here to go all the way
[57:15] because the lord is going to take me all
[57:17] the way
[57:18] hallelujah praise the lord amen amen
[57:22] praise god
[57:23] hallelujah
[57:24] amen see god called abraham that's what
[57:27] matters
[57:28] that's the difference between us and i
[57:31] say you know god can call anyone he
[57:33] wants but in this very time and space i
[57:34] say well the difference between me and
[57:36] maybe someone else's god called me god
[57:38] may call them later but he's called me
[57:39] and i'm happy
[57:40] i pray call them i mean so the
[57:42] difference between israel and the rest
[57:43] of the world is god made a covenant with
[57:45] them
[57:46] and the difference between the bride of
[57:48] christ and the rest of the world is that
[57:49] god has made a covenant with you
[57:51] amen and if he made the covenant he's
[57:53] going to fulfill it
[57:55] because it's an unconditional covenant
[57:56] see we've got to think see the devil's
[57:58] all about my works and me and remember
[58:00] he said i will ascend i'll be like the
[58:02] most high i'm going to be this way i'm
[58:04] going to be worshipped as god me me me i
[58:07] i self
[58:09] that's what
[58:10] that's how he operates
[58:12] but you know the law doesn't say if you
[58:14] do he says i've done it just walk in it
[58:17] right just walk in my promises walk in
[58:19] my promised word that's why he died on
[58:21] calvary amen jesus i mean brother brown
[58:24] would say in israel in the church you'd
[58:25] say no
[58:26] um he'd say he say and now
[58:29] christ
[58:30] was hanging between he was slain yonder
[58:33] between heavens and earth when the sun
[58:35] went down blackness over the earth and
[58:36] there he was uh tore apart god pulled
[58:39] the soul out of him and he wrote a
[58:41] covenant with the families of the earth
[58:43] when that precious unadulterated blood
[58:45] of the almighty god dripping from
[58:47] emmanuel's veins he tore that soul out
[58:49] of him he cried my god my god why is
[58:51] that forsaken me his face was full of
[58:54] mockery spit a crown of cruel mockery
[58:56] pulled down over his brow his nails
[58:58] drove with roman spikes his back riven
[59:00] until his ribs showed through swinging
[59:02] on the cross screaming dying as sinner's
[59:04] death the sin of the world was upon him
[59:06] and their god riven his sides tore his
[59:08] soul out of him then he said unto him
[59:10] into thy hands i command my spirit he
[59:12] dropped his head and the earth shook and
[59:14] belches rocks there he is there's god's
[59:16] covenant there's the fulfilling of it
[59:19] so he wrote a covenant with you that day
[59:22] hallelujah
[59:23] amen and that covenant is not the same
[59:25] covenant he has with the devil then
[59:27] because he made a promise with the devil
[59:29] there in the judgment seat there in in
[59:31] the garden of eden when sin had come in
[59:33] he he made a promise to satan the head
[59:36] of the seed
[59:37] the seed of the woman is going to bruise
[59:39] or crush the head of the seed of the
[59:41] serpent
[59:42] hallelujah and that was fulfilled in
[59:43] christ so he made a promise with the
[59:45] devil it wasn't a good promise for the
[59:47] devil
[59:47] right but he didn't make that same
[59:49] promise with us
[59:50] amen he said i'm going to make you in my
[59:52] image amen you're going to be like me
[59:54] you're going to be my word in flesh amen
[59:56] it's not going to be your nature it's
[59:57] not going to be you living it's going to
[59:58] be me living through you
[1:00:01] hallelujah amen
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:04] and so the covenant that he made with us
[1:00:06] is literally he would take sin nature
[1:00:08] out of our lives
[1:00:10] and he would write his word upon our
[1:00:12] hearts by the holy ghost and he would
[1:00:14] dwell in our hearts and manifest his
[1:00:16] word through us
[1:00:17] that was his covenant that we would
[1:00:19] become living walking talking bible
[1:00:22] hallelujah and it's not by memory
[1:00:24] reciting chapter and verse which is fine
[1:00:26] but it's lived out of our hearts
[1:00:28] amen amen
[1:00:30] hallelujah
[1:00:32] so they had to go
[1:00:35] see
[1:00:35] israel had the pillar of fire walking
[1:00:37] with them
[1:00:38] they had god the shard of the king was
[1:00:40] in the camp
[1:00:41] sure balaam had the same sacrifices as
[1:00:43] as as moses did but but the difference
[1:00:46] between balaam and moses is that moses
[1:00:48] had the pillar of fire they had the
[1:00:50] shout of the king in the camp they were
[1:00:52] on their way to fulfill the promise of
[1:00:53] the hour that was the difference now
[1:00:55] that same pillar of fire is leading the
[1:00:56] church today he has always led his
[1:00:59] church
[1:01:00] amen from the old testament to the new
[1:01:01] because we know jehovah of the old is
[1:01:03] jesus christ of the news amen so i say
[1:01:06] stop analyzing what i'm saying and just
[1:01:07] enjoy
[1:01:08] okay so listen it's the same pillar of
[1:01:10] fire as leading us i mean that same holy
[1:01:13] ghost anointing is leading us the same
[1:01:15] god that led them to their promises the
[1:01:17] same god leading us to our promise right
[1:01:19] we are not here just to go through a
[1:01:21] religious motion but we're here to live
[1:01:24] a overcoming life be full of praise and
[1:01:26] glory highly enough with doubt and
[1:01:28] unbelief and trouble and none of that
[1:01:30] stuff but joy unspeakable full of glory
[1:01:33] amen hallelujah
[1:01:35] amen so those soldiers if i could just
[1:01:37] dramatize it they're on jericho's walls
[1:01:40] you know the army of jericho you know
[1:01:42] they're they're behind the battlements
[1:01:44] and maybe they're glad their knees are
[1:01:45] behind battlements because their knees
[1:01:47] are shaking like this
[1:01:48] and they're wondering what are they
[1:01:49] going to do and they're going around
[1:01:51] what are they going to do and maybe
[1:01:52] after six days
[1:01:54] maybe they start to whisper i can't take
[1:01:55] this no more
[1:01:56] well they're going to attack a lot i
[1:01:58] can't take the psychological warfare
[1:02:00] going on in our minds and the devil's
[1:02:02] the same thing you get up in the morning
[1:02:04] you're the most powerful people on the
[1:02:06] earth
[1:02:07] the brighter jesus christ is the most
[1:02:09] powerful people in existence it's not
[1:02:11] nato it's not putin it's not whoever
[1:02:13] it's you
[1:02:15] because you have power within you to
[1:02:16] shape the kingdom of hell amen to
[1:02:18] actually cast the devil out of people's
[1:02:20] lives that people's lives are eternally
[1:02:23] changed
[1:02:24] hallelujah and you roll out of bed in
[1:02:26] the morning
[1:02:27] and the devil's knees begin to shake
[1:02:29] what are they going to do today
[1:02:32] hallelujah
[1:02:34] i pray i pray hell talks about me like
[1:02:36] that
[1:02:37] don't you want to be
[1:02:38] the most feared thing in hell
[1:02:41] hallelujah as a believer filled with the
[1:02:43] holy ghost that's what the most fair the
[1:02:46] most fair thing you know what i love you
[1:02:48] know jesus would jesus would go in in
[1:02:51] matthew 8
[1:02:53] and
[1:02:53] he would he would go to the um country
[1:02:56] of the uh
[1:02:57] gecenerys or have you say it and then
[1:02:59] met him two men possessed with devils
[1:03:01] coming out of the tombs are exceedingly
[1:03:03] fast
[1:03:04] so that no man might pass that way so
[1:03:06] here were these two demon-possessed men
[1:03:08] they lived in the tombs and you know the
[1:03:10] devil loves death
[1:03:11] and separation that's how he operates
[1:03:14] and so the they're demon-possessed men
[1:03:16] and they and people wouldn't walk near
[1:03:18] them anymore because they're exceedingly
[1:03:20] fast
[1:03:21] and you know maybe travelers would go
[1:03:23] this way and say hold on we can't go
[1:03:25] this way this is too demon possessed man
[1:03:26] we're not going this way and they're
[1:03:27] going maybe go the long way around but
[1:03:29] then jesus steps on the shore
[1:03:32] and he begins to walk that way
[1:03:34] and now these exceedingly fierce demon
[1:03:36] possessed men
[1:03:38] the spirit cries out of them
[1:03:41] and and the cry is not i'm going to
[1:03:43] destroy you
[1:03:44] this is your last day
[1:03:46] you you're going to wish you'll be dead
[1:03:48] before i kill you no their cries what
[1:03:51] have we to do with thee jesus thou son
[1:03:53] of god art thou come hither to torment
[1:03:56] us before the time so he's so so the
[1:03:59] devil is asking the lord have you come
[1:04:01] to torment us before the time so they
[1:04:03] know there's a time
[1:04:05] they know there's the time when they are
[1:04:07] going to be tormented
[1:04:09] and jesus could have said actually i
[1:04:11] have yeah
[1:04:12] and he could have tortured them he could
[1:04:14] have fixed them he could have those
[1:04:15] spirits now he could have literally put
[1:04:18] them like they were in the lake of fire
[1:04:19] already
[1:04:21] hey man so this is imagine now this is
[1:04:23] the mental health trouble
[1:04:25] that the devil has he has this over his
[1:04:27] head every day now i'm not trying to
[1:04:29] make you feel sorry for him but i just
[1:04:31] want to get you to realize this is this
[1:04:32] is what he lives with this is not just a
[1:04:35] bad day this is not just a bad decade
[1:04:38] this is not just a stressful century
[1:04:40] this is a stressful 6 000 years or
[1:04:43] however long where he knows his time is
[1:04:45] coming
[1:04:46] and now so so this is really the heart
[1:04:48] of the devil is it really have you come
[1:04:50] to torment us before the time i don't
[1:04:52] think it's time yet jesus i've read your
[1:04:54] word and no no we're not here yet you
[1:04:56] know but but this was the this was their
[1:04:58] big concern
[1:04:59] have you come to torment us and imagine
[1:05:02] waking up knowing you've got a death
[1:05:03] sentence the clock is ticking
[1:05:06] you know the same promises we shout and
[1:05:07] rejoice in
[1:05:09] we're in the rapture season we're living
[1:05:11] in the season the resurrection because
[1:05:13] the word says we're here right our
[1:05:15] bodies are going to be changed the dead
[1:05:16] and christ are going to rise it's not a
[1:05:18] fantasy
[1:05:19] it's not a fantasy a fairy tale it's a
[1:05:21] reality we see the world falling apart
[1:05:23] it's meant to fall apart we see prophecy
[1:05:25] being fulfilled and it excites our souls
[1:05:28] it doesn't excite him
[1:05:30] it just raises his blood pressure
[1:05:32] it stresses them all the more anxiety
[1:05:34] begins to shoot through the roof why
[1:05:36] because he's though that time that they
[1:05:38] talked about 2000 years ago is just
[1:05:41] around the corner
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:44] hallelujah
[1:05:46] amen so they know there's a time
[1:05:48] appointed they know there's great
[1:05:50] trouble
[1:05:52] ahead for them
[1:05:54] this made me happy
[1:05:57] because i really realized you know
[1:05:59] satan's full of anxiety
[1:06:01] he's full of stress he's full of worry
[1:06:04] he has no more courage all of hell's
[1:06:06] heart is fainted
[1:06:08] right
[1:06:09] they're full of stress they're ringing
[1:06:11] their hands how we're going to pull this
[1:06:13] off boys i thought it was going to work
[1:06:15] you told us lucifer it wouldn't all
[1:06:17] these things going on
[1:06:18] but you see now he wants to take that
[1:06:21] mental health pandemic in hell
[1:06:24] and put it upon you
[1:06:25] he wants you to feel the same way he's
[1:06:27] feeling
[1:06:29] and brother brown was saying the lady is
[1:06:30] seeing church age he'd say
[1:06:33] so this is from this is from where it
[1:06:35] says about our age that we're rich and
[1:06:36] miserable poor blind and naked speak of
[1:06:38] the age that we live in he says god says
[1:06:40] this
[1:06:41] uh church of later seeing ages wretched
[1:06:43] that word comes from that word comes
[1:06:45] from two greek words which means to
[1:06:47] endure endure and trial and it has
[1:06:50] nothing but it has nothing to do with
[1:06:51] trials that come to a true christian for
[1:06:54] god describes a christian trial as
[1:06:56] blessed
[1:06:57] uh and his attitude of one of joy
[1:06:59] whereas this description is phrased as
[1:07:01] wretched and miserable how strange
[1:07:03] in this land in this age of planting
[1:07:06] in this age of progress in this age of
[1:07:08] abundance how can there be trials
[1:07:11] well now it is strange but in this age
[1:07:13] of plenty and opportunity when everyone
[1:07:16] has so much
[1:07:17] and there's so much more to be had
[1:07:20] what with all the inventions to do our
[1:07:22] work and so many things to give us
[1:07:24] pleasure suddenly we find mental illness
[1:07:27] taking such a toll as to alarm the
[1:07:29] nation where everybody ought to be happy
[1:07:32] with really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:07:34] millions are taking sedatives at night
[1:07:36] pet pills in the morning rushing to
[1:07:38] doctors entering institutions trying to
[1:07:40] drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes
[1:07:43] this age boasts of its tremendous stores
[1:07:46] of worldly goods but people are less
[1:07:49] happy than ever this age boasts of its
[1:07:51] spiritual attainments but the people are
[1:07:53] less sure about themselves never now we
[1:07:56] should be there should be a time when
[1:07:57] we're more sure about ourselves
[1:08:00] because the lord has promised good to us
[1:08:02] amen he has given us our shadow of a
[1:08:04] doubt thus saith the lord on the
[1:08:06] scripture this is the age of the body
[1:08:07] change and he's prepared us to take that
[1:08:10] change right we should know who we are
[1:08:12] in the states more than anything else we
[1:08:13] should know who we are
[1:08:15] in christ i mean this age boasts of
[1:08:18] better moral values and it is more
[1:08:20] corrupt than any age since the flood it
[1:08:21] talks about its knowledge in science but
[1:08:23] it's fighting a losing battle in all
[1:08:25] fields for the human mind and soul and
[1:08:27] spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast
[1:08:29] with all the changes that have come upon
[1:08:32] the earth in one generation we've gone
[1:08:34] all the way from the horse and buggy age
[1:08:36] to the space age and we're proud and
[1:08:38] boastful about it but inside is a dark
[1:08:40] void cavern that is crying out in
[1:08:42] torment and without a known reason men's
[1:08:45] hearts are failing for fear and the
[1:08:47] world is so darkened that this age could
[1:08:49] well be called the age of neurotics it
[1:08:52] boasts but it cannot back it up it cries
[1:08:54] peace and there is no peace it cries
[1:08:56] there's a great amplitude of all things
[1:08:58] but it keeps burning with desire like an
[1:09:00] unsatisfied fire there is no peace at
[1:09:02] the lord to the wicked
[1:09:04] now that was back in 1965 that was
[1:09:06] written
[1:09:07] and we can see it in 2022
[1:09:09] there's a mental health crisis upon the
[1:09:11] earth where we shouldn't have a mental
[1:09:13] health crisis i remember when um when um
[1:09:16] uh bernie noelier first came here from
[1:09:18] argentina and i just said how this this
[1:09:20] country is one of the greatest suicide
[1:09:22] rates in the world
[1:09:23] and they couldn't they couldn't fathom
[1:09:25] that what you have everything you don't
[1:09:27] have to struggle there's money there's
[1:09:29] food there's jobs there's you know but
[1:09:31] yet how can there be this suicide rate
[1:09:34] so high it's because there's an
[1:09:36] emptiness
[1:09:37] but what it is it's the devil's mental
[1:09:40] health health crisis has been put onto
[1:09:42] human beings
[1:09:44] amen right
[1:09:46] that's that's what's happened because
[1:09:47] he's he's projecting how he feels
[1:09:50] upon people because remember we we we
[1:09:54] uh we are influenced by two sides
[1:09:56] heaven and hell
[1:09:58] right
[1:09:59] so god's word is wanting to influence us
[1:10:02] but then hell wants to influence us also
[1:10:04] now just because we are christians does
[1:10:06] not make us immune from the influence of
[1:10:09] the devil
[1:10:10] right we're still built like everyone
[1:10:11] else we still have the same spirit realm
[1:10:13] like everyone else everything the
[1:10:15] difference is we have god on the inside
[1:10:16] if you really know him
[1:10:18] right you have an overcoming power with
[1:10:20] union which is he himself is in you the
[1:10:22] lord jesus christ but you see so so so
[1:10:25] there's these two powers pushing us and
[1:10:27] if we are not careful we will begin
[1:10:30] to think like the rest of the world
[1:10:33] because that same influence remember
[1:10:35] this world is in ladies here
[1:10:37] right we are not in some force-filled
[1:10:39] bubble where the world cannot affect us
[1:10:41] we're in the world but we're not of the
[1:10:43] world but the world will try and affect
[1:10:44] us so the atmosphere at work or at
[1:10:46] school or at your job will try and
[1:10:49] influence you
[1:10:50] and try and drag you down to where it is
[1:10:53] amen so what is that that's the devil
[1:10:55] trying to make you think like he thinks
[1:10:58] how he feels
[1:11:00] get you to feel that same way remember
[1:11:02] his heart's failed why are men's hearts
[1:11:05] failing for fear because the devil's
[1:11:06] heart's failing
[1:11:08] he is he is in panic mode
[1:11:10] and he wants us to be in panic mode now
[1:11:14] don't get me wrong
[1:11:16] when i'm talking about being
[1:11:18] uh
[1:11:19] being a bit i mean you know we are all
[1:11:22] subject to being nervous
[1:11:24] right or being a bit anxious a bit
[1:11:26] worried about something
[1:11:28] that's all within normal human emotional
[1:11:30] range
[1:11:32] but when i talk about depression
[1:11:34] and really being anxious that you can't
[1:11:36] cope with anything new anything
[1:11:37] different that's not normal
[1:11:40] right yeah so
[1:11:42] don't get me wrong if i'm you know don't
[1:11:44] misunderstand me if i say well we
[1:11:45] shouldn't be anxious
[1:11:48] you know or rather rather you know
[1:11:50] the reason you feel anxious is because
[1:11:52] of you know the devil's trying to put it
[1:11:54] on you if it's just normal who's ever
[1:11:56] been worried to get something done but
[1:11:58] it's just within a normal range of human
[1:12:00] feeling right or you get stressed i've
[1:12:01] got to get this done i've got to clean
[1:12:03] this zero that's normal right brother
[1:12:05] ram says we all need a bit of pressure
[1:12:07] in our lives otherwise it'd be jellyfish
[1:12:08] we all actually need a bit of pressure
[1:12:10] is good too much pressure is bad
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:13] so
[1:12:14] so please don't take this out of
[1:12:16] out of cater
[1:12:18] and also i want to say this just because
[1:12:20] you feel anxious or even depression
[1:12:22] tries to come upon you does not mean
[1:12:23] you're not a christian
[1:12:26] right because those same things will try
[1:12:27] and affect you
[1:12:29] if you agree with it it will if you say
[1:12:31] no it can't
[1:12:32] but it's up to you who you know are you
[1:12:34] going to agree with him or not
[1:12:37] so he wants to
[1:12:38] get us to feel and think the way he's
[1:12:40] feeling and thinking
[1:12:42] if he can get you to agree with him then
[1:12:44] he can influence your life just like the
[1:12:46] holy ghost wants you to agree with him
[1:12:48] if you fully agree with him he'll take
[1:12:50] over your life the word will take over
[1:12:51] your life
[1:12:55] amen so now
[1:12:56] we all have happy times we have sad
[1:12:58] times stressful times relaxing times
[1:13:00] distressing times we all go through
[1:13:01] those range of experience right but i'm
[1:13:03] talking about being nervous all the time
[1:13:05] or being depressed all the time being
[1:13:07] anxious all the time being overly
[1:13:08] stressed all the time yo that's
[1:13:10] unhealthy being envious of others
[1:13:13] that's a curse
[1:13:15] being jealous that's that's the devil's
[1:13:17] feelings
[1:13:18] that's the devil's experience
[1:13:20] right because it says in the bible this
[1:13:22] is from the english standard version
[1:13:23] philippians 4 and 6 be not anxious about
[1:13:25] anything but in everything by prayer and
[1:13:27] supplication with thanksgiving let your
[1:13:29] requests made known to god so is it so
[1:13:31] the bible saying don't be anxious about
[1:13:33] anything amen just give it all to the
[1:13:35] lord with prayer and supplication it
[1:13:38] says in the peace of god which surpasses
[1:13:39] all understanding will guard your hearts
[1:13:41] and your minds in christ jesus so our
[1:13:43] minds need to be guarded right by prayer
[1:13:46] and supplication don't be anxious about
[1:13:48] it just give it to the lord amen right
[1:13:50] just trust your day trust your schedule
[1:13:52] into his hands
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:55] now
[1:13:57] it's like
[1:13:59] you know
[1:14:00] loneliness
[1:14:02] is not of god
[1:14:04] to feel alone that no one understands
[1:14:06] you no one cares you can't relate to
[1:14:08] your own and feeling alone
[1:14:10] now unfortunately in this age and
[1:14:12] especially with the pandemic that we
[1:14:14] have is loneliness has skyrocketed
[1:14:17] people are being disconnected even
[1:14:18] though we have zoom in different devices
[1:14:20] there's not actually real emotional
[1:14:22] attachment to it even in friendship
[1:14:24] and so people feel lonely
[1:14:26] now loneliness is of hell
[1:14:29] jesus would tell the story of a certain
[1:14:31] rich man
[1:14:33] and then lazarus the beggar and they
[1:14:34] both died
[1:14:36] and the rich man went to hell
[1:14:38] and and and he lifted up his eyes and he
[1:14:41] saw that great chasm and then on the
[1:14:42] other side of the great chasm was was
[1:14:44] lazarus the poor man
[1:14:46] in the bosom of abraham
[1:14:48] so in heaven there was fellowship
[1:14:50] it was abraham and lazarus there was
[1:14:51] fellowship in heaven
[1:14:53] right but but but the poor man in hell
[1:14:55] he just saw them he didn't see anyone
[1:14:56] else around them
[1:14:58] but he wouldn't he wouldn't
[1:14:59] unfortunately be the only person in hell
[1:15:02] there's other people there but because
[1:15:04] there's an attribute of hell everyone
[1:15:05] will feel alone yeah yeah right
[1:15:09] so we should never ever if we feel alone
[1:15:12] it's because that lung that true
[1:15:14] loneliness of being cut off from
[1:15:15] everyone and is not from god
[1:15:18] it's the devil trying to put his
[1:15:20] feelings upon you so you've got to
[1:15:21] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:15:23] spirit
[1:15:24] right if you feel alone that's not god
[1:15:27] making you feel alone that's the enemy
[1:15:29] trying to cut you off from everything
[1:15:31] that's a lie it's a tormenting spirit
[1:15:34] depression is not of god
[1:15:36] amen to be sad sure we'll be sad we need
[1:15:39] you know
[1:15:40] to be sad and cry is actually a healthy
[1:15:42] thing
[1:15:43] it's actually healthy to mourn
[1:15:45] it's a healthy thing right
[1:15:47] oh yes
[1:15:49] right but but to be depressed is not
[1:15:51] right
[1:15:53] but that depression is because the
[1:15:54] devil's depressed
[1:15:56] i thought i was gonna win if he if you
[1:15:58] tell the truth sure he's deceived
[1:16:00] somebody thinks he's gonna pull it but
[1:16:02] if he's really honest he'll say no i'm
[1:16:03] done
[1:16:04] i couldn't stop this much scripture
[1:16:06] being fulfilled amen how can i stop the
[1:16:09] end being fulfilled
[1:16:10] if god promises and promises and
[1:16:12] fulfilled this how can he not fulfill
[1:16:14] this
[1:16:14] if he is honest this is how he'd really
[1:16:16] begin to think and yet so depression is
[1:16:19] from a demon spirit
[1:16:22] right to be overly stressed and anxious
[1:16:24] that's the devil's feelings
[1:16:26] he's stressed his time's coming
[1:16:30] he's anxious about it his morale is not
[1:16:32] high he's not confident he may appear to
[1:16:35] be confident but he's nothing but a
[1:16:36] bluff
[1:16:37] he's stressing out his blood pressure if
[1:16:40] he has such a thing has gone through the
[1:16:41] charts
[1:16:43] i say go higher lord make him go higher
[1:16:45] right
[1:16:46] he's having all kinds of things going on
[1:16:48] in himself
[1:16:50] and it's not peace it's not love it's
[1:16:52] not joy it's stress anxiety depression
[1:16:55] worry fear if you have fear in your life
[1:16:58] that fear is not from god
[1:17:00] that's because of demons fear
[1:17:03] they put that trying to put that same
[1:17:04] experience on you
[1:17:07] amen see if we can discern these things
[1:17:09] like hold on this is not this is not god
[1:17:12] this is the devil doing this to me amen
[1:17:14] i don't have to put up with it
[1:17:16] i mean to be nervous you can't handle
[1:17:18] the smallest thing that's that's that's
[1:17:20] not of god it's not a healthy way to be
[1:17:23] it's not a right way to be
[1:17:26] and so he's trying to the devil is
[1:17:27] trying to put his experiences upon you
[1:17:30] in your daily life i know i'm repeating
[1:17:32] myself i want to emphasize this
[1:17:34] because we can be so led by emotion so
[1:17:36] easily
[1:17:38] you know and we should never you know
[1:17:40] when it comes to worshiping god our
[1:17:41] emotions should not dictate it
[1:17:44] right i'm saved
[1:17:46] irrespective of how i feel
[1:17:48] amen my feelings don't come into it it's
[1:17:50] faith that comes into it amen amen i'm
[1:17:53] going to rapture because of faith not
[1:17:55] because of how i feel
[1:17:57] i'm i'm an overcomer not because of how
[1:17:59] i feel because of what i believe because
[1:18:01] of what's been anchored in my heart
[1:18:02] right so we shouldn't come to worship
[1:18:05] you know some people come to church and
[1:18:06] they do and they just sit there like a
[1:18:08] stone because they've had a hard week
[1:18:10] i'm not here to worship my week
[1:18:12] i'm here to worship god
[1:18:14] hallelujah i'm here to worship god i
[1:18:16] wanna i'll lift my voice say god you're
[1:18:18] my king you're my everything you've
[1:18:20] washed me white as snow you've redeemed
[1:18:21] me i was in darkness the devil had me
[1:18:23] bound but you set me free and you've
[1:18:25] killed the devils behind me and they're
[1:18:27] dead in the blood of jesus christ i can
[1:18:29] walk god in victory hallelujah he's my
[1:18:31] lover he's never has jesus done anything
[1:18:34] wrong to anyone
[1:18:35] amen
[1:18:36] the devil thinks he's done something
[1:18:38] wrong to him and he wants to put that
[1:18:40] you know the devil's angry with god
[1:18:42] he's angry with god yeah and so he tries
[1:18:45] to put that same anger on people people
[1:18:46] get resentful it's god's fault
[1:18:48] god i hate you because you do i'm not
[1:18:50] going to serve you no more because you
[1:18:51] did this
[1:18:52] it's because the devil put that's his
[1:18:54] experience
[1:18:55] because of his pride
[1:18:57] and so he puts that upon people and
[1:18:59] people agree with it but they're
[1:19:00] actually just living up the devil's
[1:19:02] experience
[1:19:03] i'm not here to live out the devil's
[1:19:04] experience i need to live out god's
[1:19:06] experience hallelujah
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:12] amen so
[1:19:14] the blood of jesus christ has redeemed
[1:19:16] us from the devil's grip
[1:19:18] so none of what he is going through
[1:19:20] belongs to you
[1:19:22] the blood has loosed you from the
[1:19:25] grip of satan completely not just one
[1:19:27] finger off they're all gone not just one
[1:19:30] chain dead
[1:19:31] you can't be bound by broken chains
[1:19:33] unless you agree with those broken
[1:19:35] chains and think they actually have
[1:19:36] control in your life see the devil wants
[1:19:38] us to think we're still bound but no the
[1:19:40] blood has loosed us amen so every part
[1:19:43] of the devil has no part in our lives
[1:19:45] right so his fear his anxiety his
[1:19:48] depression his unbelief his whatever it
[1:19:51] is that's negative on his side pride
[1:19:53] jealousy envy strife emulations anger
[1:19:56] what um unforgiveness stubbornness
[1:19:58] whatever it is that has no part in you
[1:20:01] because the blood has loosed it from you
[1:20:04] hallelujah we have no part in him and he
[1:20:06] has no part in us
[1:20:08] amen we've got to keep that in our
[1:20:10] hearts because when the devil tries to
[1:20:11] put his depression on us or
[1:20:13] unforgiveness on us or jealousy on us or
[1:20:16] you know feeling you know being anxious
[1:20:19] and stress and nervousness and so on no
[1:20:20] no hold on you got to look and say
[1:20:24] is this in our covenant god
[1:20:28] hold on
[1:20:29] um
[1:20:30] no
[1:20:31] yeah well then why why am i owning it
[1:20:34] yeah why am i taking possession of it
[1:20:36] why why am i making it part of my being
[1:20:39] you know people will take stubbornness
[1:20:41] and they'll and and their middle name
[1:20:42] will be stubbornness or pride or
[1:20:45] jealousy or envy it's basically their
[1:20:47] middle name because they're because they
[1:20:49] live it out of their lives they can't
[1:20:50] help it but what's happened they've
[1:20:52] taken ownership of it they've actually
[1:20:54] said this is me
[1:20:55] no that's not you this is you
[1:20:57] this is you amen not those things but
[1:21:00] you've got to realize actually this has
[1:21:01] no pardon me jesus did not die to make
[1:21:04] me proud he did not die to make me
[1:21:06] boastful he did not die to make me
[1:21:08] envious he had not died to make me
[1:21:09] jealous he'd not die to give me unbelief
[1:21:12] no he died that i'd give have life and
[1:21:14] life more abundantly i mean that he had
[1:21:16] lived my life and he'd manifest his word
[1:21:18] that's why he died
[1:21:20] amen so we need to very much look into
[1:21:22] these things and say
[1:21:24] uh uh hold on satan take your goods and
[1:21:26] go
[1:21:27] they're not mine they're yours stop
[1:21:30] trying to give me your experience
[1:21:32] satan
[1:21:33] i can't give you my experience but i can
[1:21:35] tell you my experience
[1:21:37] he knows your experience he was there
[1:21:40] when the lord saved your soul when he
[1:21:42] got cast out of the throne room of your
[1:21:43] heart he got dethroned amen
[1:21:47] one of my favorite scriptures and there
[1:21:49] was war in heaven michael and his angels
[1:21:50] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[1:21:52] fought and his angels and prevailed not
[1:21:54] neither was her place found any more in
[1:21:56] heaven
[1:21:57] so the devil was cast down he was thrown
[1:21:59] down he didn't jump he was pushed
[1:22:02] hallelujah
[1:22:03] and the great dragon was cast out that
[1:22:05] old serpent called the devil and satan
[1:22:07] which deceived the whole world he was
[1:22:09] cast out into the earth and his angels
[1:22:11] were cast out with him so everything
[1:22:13] that we're fighting is as a fallen enemy
[1:22:16] it fell he didn't come down on his own
[1:22:18] choosing he was pushed
[1:22:20] hallelujah he was cast out amen the lord
[1:22:23] said get out of heaven satan he was cast
[1:22:25] out upon the earth now what i love about
[1:22:27] it is that same god that pursued him out
[1:22:29] of heaven has come down upon the earth
[1:22:31] aiding to pursue his enemy upon the
[1:22:33] earth so that's why the devils were
[1:22:35] shaking in their boots when jesus came
[1:22:37] their way have you come to torment us
[1:22:38] before the time yeah yes they are
[1:22:40] exceedingly fierce to humans but to god
[1:22:42] they're just nothing
[1:22:45] hallelujah
[1:22:46] amen i heard a loud voice in heaven now
[1:22:49] with salvation and strength in the
[1:22:50] kingdom of our god and the power of
[1:22:52] christ for the accuser of brethren is
[1:22:54] cast down which accused him before our
[1:22:57] god day and night and now he's our
[1:22:58] scripture and they overcame him by the
[1:23:00] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:23:02] their testimony and their love that not
[1:23:04] their lives until the death it means
[1:23:06] they overcame him so it's amazing
[1:23:09] so
[1:23:10] we're overcoming him now
[1:23:12] but the bible's already and i've
[1:23:14] overcome him yeah it's done all my life
[1:23:16] it's already prophesied it's done i'm
[1:23:18] just walking into the prophecy and as
[1:23:20] i'm walking it's being fulfilled
[1:23:22] i mean so overcome by the blood of the
[1:23:24] lamb why because the devil is washed
[1:23:26] from us loose from us by the blood of
[1:23:27] jesus christ amen unbelief is taken from
[1:23:30] us he doesn't control our lives no more
[1:23:33] if you're a spirit-filled christian
[1:23:35] god is the king of your life
[1:23:37] amen not the devil if you're not it's

[1:23:52] amen we should be a bunch of rebels
[1:23:53] against the devil
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:58] hallelujah
[1:23:59] amen and they overcome by the bloodline
[1:24:01] and the word of their testimony what is
[1:24:03] that you are testifying sure it's the
[1:24:05] word of your testimony what god has done
[1:24:07] on you in your life but your testimony
[1:24:09] should be the word of god concerning you
[1:24:12] amen i am i am beloved
[1:24:15] i am accepted i am redeemed hallelujah
[1:24:18] i've been made in his image my children
[1:24:20] are coming my family's coming nowhere

[1:24:23] i've got joy i've got peace i've got
[1:24:25] love amen i've got faith i've got
[1:24:27] overcoming power because the word says
[1:24:29] i'm testifying i'm giving witness this
[1:24:31] word is true because it's been promised
[1:24:33] to me yes lord hallelujah amen amen
[1:24:36] therefore rejoice your heavens and you
[1:24:38] that dwell in them we sit in heavenly
[1:24:39] places we're called to rejoice
[1:24:41] amen woe to the inhabitants of the earth
[1:24:43] and of the sea for the devils come down
[1:24:44] to you having great wrath because he
[1:24:47] knows he has but a short time
[1:24:50] time's ticking devil time's ticking
[1:24:53] hallelujah see you've got to realize you
[1:24:55] know the devil tries to torment you i'm
[1:24:56] going to get you i'm going to get you
[1:24:57] i'm going to get you you're going to go
[1:24:59] too far you'll say no devil god's
[1:25:00] already got you
[1:25:02] amen because he conquered you on calvary
[1:25:04] you have peace your own health you know
[1:25:06] you are defeated
[1:25:07] so don't leave the devil tormented
[1:25:09] you're going to get your children i'm
[1:25:10] going to get your family i'm going to
[1:25:11] get no no satan
[1:25:12] my god has got you already he's got your
[1:25:15] number i mean you've already been found
[1:25:17] guilty and you're on your way to the
[1:25:19] chopping block
[1:25:20] you're on death row not me
[1:25:23] amen amen hallelujah
[1:25:26] hallelujah
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] praise the lord
[1:25:32] that's why we've got to look into these
[1:25:33] things say you know it's not in our
[1:25:35] inheritance
[1:25:37] to have a mental health crisis
[1:25:40] it's not our portion
[1:25:42] jesus did not die
[1:25:44] that we would be depressed
[1:25:46] he would not die that would be anxious
[1:25:49] and stressed and nervous
[1:25:51] and alone hallelujah he didn't die for
[1:25:54] those things
[1:25:55] that's not our inheritance
[1:25:58] our inheritance is the holy ghost
[1:26:01] our inheritance is love see
[1:26:04] the difference between
[1:26:05] see see satan was the king of our lives
[1:26:08] once
[1:26:09] but then the but then he was dethroned
[1:26:11] and god became the king of our life
[1:26:14] right so once upon a time
[1:26:16] the believer walked according to the
[1:26:17] spirit of this world the prince of the
[1:26:19] power of the year
[1:26:20] that now will that that is now working
[1:26:23] and the children of disobedience this is
[1:26:24] ephesians two and two so we all walked
[1:26:27] once once upon a time according to the
[1:26:29] devil
[1:26:30] but then the difference is that when he
[1:26:32] was cast out the lord jesus became king
[1:26:34] on the throne of our hearts
[1:26:36] so we used to walk according to his
[1:26:38] unbelief we used to walk according to
[1:26:40] his doubt to his stress to his anxiety
[1:26:43] but now the believer by the baptism of
[1:26:45] the holy ghost walks according to god's
[1:26:47] faith
[1:26:48] god's love god's peace god's joy god's
[1:26:52] comfort and god's wisdom
[1:26:54] amen that's our portion
[1:26:56] amen yo stress is not my portion anxiety
[1:27:00] not my inheritance right nervousness not
[1:27:03] my inheritance those things are not for
[1:27:05] us i i i'm repeating this for a point
[1:27:08] because you gotta really stop because
[1:27:09] sometimes we get so stressed and worried
[1:27:11] and depressed and down you gotta realize
[1:27:12] hold on devil
[1:27:14] i don't want your experience
[1:27:16] that's not my experience i went to
[1:27:18] calvary i got born again the lord
[1:27:20] transformed my life i'm on the pilgrims
[1:27:22] highway
[1:27:23] satan your experience is not my
[1:27:24] experience so stop trying to give it to
[1:27:27] me
[1:27:29] amen it has no part in us
[1:27:32] hallelujah
[1:27:34] amen you see it's time that we
[1:27:37] started walking
[1:27:39] according to what god has given us
[1:27:42] brother man says it's a real matching
[1:27:44] time i'm going to read two quotes that
[1:27:45] i'm going to go real matching time don't
[1:27:47] try to match your neighbor match some of
[1:27:49] the saints in the bible

[1:28:00] saint live like a saint die like a saint
[1:28:02] go to heaven like you say
[1:28:03] amen that's how we should be so we
[1:28:05] should think like a saint i'm more than
[1:28:07] an overcomer i'm more than a conqueror
[1:28:08] through him that loved me
[1:28:10] if god before me who can be against me
[1:28:12] nothing can be against me every weapon's
[1:28:14] got to fall every demon power's going to
[1:28:16] bow to the name of jesus christ amen if
[1:28:19] god before me who can be against me
[1:28:21] hallelujah
[1:28:23] that's how we should think
[1:28:25] amen the devil's trying to hold the
[1:28:26] promise of god from your life you say no
[1:28:28] satan back up in the name of jesus
[1:28:29] christ he tells you you can't have the
[1:28:31] holy ghost move in your house he's lying
[1:28:34] amen if he tells you you can't have a
[1:28:35] real experience he's lying
[1:28:37] if he tells you you cannot have an
[1:28:38] experience that'll keep you forever he's
[1:28:40] lying i mean he just tells you it's just
[1:28:42] be another kind of camp experience he's
[1:28:44] lying
[1:28:45] see the devil is a liar
[1:28:47] the reason is it didn't work on him
[1:28:49] because it can't work on him but it can
[1:28:50] work on you
[1:28:52] amen transform your life
[1:28:54] amen we're just going to read this and
[1:28:56] i'll
[1:28:57] as i said i will actually
[1:28:59] do that now there is no now
[1:29:01] now there is therefore no condemnation
[1:29:04] why should the church fair
[1:29:06] what promises he ever fail to manifest
[1:29:08] before us
[1:29:09] what should the church fair church of
[1:29:11] the living god what should we fear
[1:29:13] every promise up till this day he's
[1:29:15] fulfilled
[1:29:16] right and he's done it well
[1:29:18] he's fulfilled it to the letter
[1:29:20] did a virgin conceived she did was he
[1:29:23] was the christ born he was was he led to
[1:29:26] calvary yeah at the right age he was did
[1:29:28] he go down to hell with the sins of the
[1:29:30] world upon his shoulders he did did he
[1:29:32] then take the keys of hell death and
[1:29:33] grave off the devil he did did he roast
[1:29:35] triumphant he did did he come out of the
[1:29:37] tomb he did did he put out the holy
[1:29:39] ghost about pentecost he did amen did he
[1:29:41] sin malachi 4. he did i mean is he
[1:29:44] preparing a people for a rapture he is
[1:29:46] amen so you know he's as good at his
[1:29:48] word god is as good as his word amen and
[1:29:51] he doesn't promise something just to not
[1:29:53] give it
[1:29:55] he gives exactly what he promises amen
[1:29:58] but you've got to have a revelation that
[1:29:59] it is the infallible word of god
[1:30:02] amen if that same word brought israel
[1:30:04] out of egypt and put them in the
[1:30:05] promised land amen that same god that
[1:30:07] gave that promise will take us in a
[1:30:09] rapture
[1:30:10] amen
[1:30:11] so there's therefore no condemnation why
[1:30:13] is there no condemnation because you're
[1:30:14] under the blood
[1:30:15] if you're under the blood of the lord
[1:30:16] jesus christ there's no condemnation all
[1:30:19] sins are confessed it's all done
[1:30:21] right so why should the church fair
[1:30:24] what promises he ever felt to manifest
[1:30:26] before us why should it
[1:30:29] why should it fear punishment or death
[1:30:32] why should we fear those things if we've
[1:30:34] given our life into his hands
[1:30:36] then no matter what happens
[1:30:39] praise the lord
[1:30:40] amen jesus said don't fear the man the
[1:30:42] one that can destroy this flesh but it
[1:30:44] is but fear the one that can destroy the
[1:30:46] flesh and the soul in hell
[1:30:49] why is it what what can we fear you know
[1:30:51] that what is that affair of what man can
[1:30:53] do to me
[1:30:54] what can he do all he can do is actually
[1:30:56] make me go to heaven faster if i put it
[1:30:58] that way
[1:30:59] don't get to my end destination
[1:31:01] but it's in god's hands when that time
[1:31:04] happens should it happen that way so
[1:31:05] there's nothing to fear see the devil
[1:31:06] says oh you're going to die who said
[1:31:09] that that cancer is going to kill your
[1:31:10] life whose head is going to do
[1:31:13] you know it's the devil he wants to
[1:31:15] project his experience
[1:31:19] so why should it fear punishment or
[1:31:21] death it has all been overcome
[1:31:23] here is the mighty conqueror he is the
[1:31:25] one who conquered both worlds of the
[1:31:27] scene and unseen
[1:31:28] not like alexander who conquered the
[1:31:30] world
[1:31:31] at the age of 33 and knew no way to turn
[1:31:34] for further conquest he died a victim of
[1:31:36] sin and righteous living not like
[1:31:38] napoleon who conquered all europe but
[1:31:39] finally was defeated at waterloo and
[1:31:41] banished to alba only to find himself
[1:31:43] conquered but nothing could conquer
[1:31:45] christ he that descended has now
[1:31:47] ascended above all and unto him that has
[1:31:50] been given a name that is above every
[1:31:52] name yes he conquered death hell in the
[1:31:54] grave and has the keys thereof what he
[1:31:57] loses is loose than what he binds is
[1:31:59] bound there's no changing of it there is
[1:32:01] no conqueror before him and there's none
[1:32:03] beside him he alone is savior redeemer
[1:32:05] he is the only god the lord jesus christ
[1:32:08] is his name
[1:32:09] he says don't fear john don't fear
[1:32:11] little flock
[1:32:12] what i am you are here too
[1:32:14] all my power is yours my omnipotence is
[1:32:18] yours as i stand in your midst
[1:32:21] i have not come to bring fear and
[1:32:22] failure
[1:32:24] that's the devil's job that's his
[1:32:26] experience he failed in the days of
[1:32:27] moses he fell in the days of elijah he
[1:32:30] failed all the way through so i've not
[1:32:32] come to bring you fear and failure but
[1:32:34] love courage and ability
[1:32:37] all power is given unto me and it is
[1:32:39] yours to use
[1:32:41] speak the word and i'll perform it that
[1:32:43] is my covenant and it can never fail
[1:32:48] hallelujah

[1:33:14] nervous all those things say lord lead
[1:33:16] me to the revelation
[1:33:18] of who you are who i am and you that's
