[31:13] moments ago and hearing
[31:15] sister gertie saying that old song

[31:30] go into the fields of
[31:31] mission work i'm looking out at a
[31:35] sick god first here in front across this
[31:38] old beam i remember
[31:39] sandy davidson painted that on there
[31:41] about 25 years ago
[31:44] on the other side i think it's got where
[31:47] will you spend eternity think
[31:50] right here was uh
[31:53] a woman at the web daniel in the lines
[31:57] oh my many things has happened since
[32:00] then
[32:02] just about five o'clock this afternoon i
[32:05] got emergency call
[32:06] to come about 30 40 miles down the
[32:09] country here of a dying woman
[32:12] and a very precious friend georgie
[32:14] carter's mother
[32:16] and i knew there was plenty of ministers
[32:18] here to hold who i got back
[32:20] edith has been very bad too and
[32:24] while we were there the lord god moved
[32:26] on the scene and sister carter is a long
[32:28] ways from dying
[32:29] so so we're grateful for that
[32:33] and now it's getting time for communion
[32:36] service pretty soon

[32:54] that's all that's wonderful
[32:56] all right i want to speak just a word or
[32:59] two

[33:02] about
[33:03] 10 minutes 15 we'll start communion

[33:10] and i know you've had a great time
[33:12] having him
[33:14] well if you're a brother thomas kids and
[33:16] sister kids

[33:24] i'll get it
[33:25] you know they don't give up they're
[33:28] just a few days under 100 but
[33:31] but that's what keeps me courageous if
[33:34] they see people like that
[33:36] think but i'm an old man and before i
[33:39] was born he was preaching the gospel
[33:41] and then here i am an old man and they
[33:44] if they can't get out and
[33:46] make their voice ring out they just take
[33:48] a tape recorder and go in the hospital
[33:50] how's the house preaching the gospel
[33:53] that's mighty fine
[33:54] amen i'm sure happy for them and
[33:58] for all those who's anticipated and this
[34:01] the services sherry now remember we'll
[34:04] announce it now the lord willing
[34:06] just as soon as the church is finished
[34:09] which they claim will be about the 10th
[34:11] of february
[34:12] why where the lord willing we want to
[34:15] take at least
[34:16] eight or ten or days or maybe two weeks
[34:20] on those seven seals of revelations
[34:24] and uh we'll sound out cards to our
[34:27] visiting people from around
[34:29] from home here and let them know uh
[34:32] plenty time ahead so if they take an
[34:34] ocean to come
[34:35] well we sure be glad to have you here
[34:38] and maybe the lord will give us another
[34:40] display of his presence like he did the
[34:42] last time when we got through the seven
[34:44] church ages
[34:47] do you ever want to pray for somebody
[34:49] why remember me all the time
[34:51] because i'm one who really needs it now
[34:55] i'm kind of shamed myself to take up
[34:56] these 10 15 minutes here to say
[34:58] a little something before we start but
[35:01] let's bow our heads just a moment
[35:04] lord jesus yes oh
[35:08] the battle will be over someday
[35:11] and there will be no more sick to be
[35:13] prayed for and there will
[35:14] be no more sinners to repent
[35:18] but father while this day is what it is
[35:21] let us work while we have life to work
[35:23] in for the hour cometh
[35:25] when no man can work now for just a few
[35:29] moments lord i'd feel bad if i did i
[35:32] closed off this year without saying a
[35:34] few more words
[35:35] help me father i pray and i might say
[35:39] something that would play courage in the
[35:41] heart of thy people
[35:44] that we could leave here tonight after
[35:46] taking the communion and we realize that
[35:48] in the communion there is strength
[35:51] israel took the communion first down in
[35:53] egypt and walked
[35:54] 40 years without those shoes wearing out
[35:57] are their clothes getting threadbare and
[36:00] out of two million people there was no
[36:03] feeble one among them when they come out
[36:04] of the wilderness
[36:06] lord let us remember that tonight as we
[36:09] approach
[36:10] this great hour in jesus name we pray
[36:14] amen if i should speak the context that
[36:19] i had wrote down that i was going to
[36:20] start on this afternoon
[36:22] i would be here five o'clock in the
[36:24] morning but i want to
[36:26] read just a word from thank you
[36:30] from ephesians the 6th chapter 12 first
[36:33] and just for a few moments now that for
[36:35] courage
[36:36] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[36:39] blood
[36:40] but against principalities against
[36:43] powers against
[36:44] rulers of darkness of this world against
[36:47] spiritual wickedness in high places
[36:50] spiritual wickedness in high places
[36:54] and i'd like to draw from that a little
[36:57] uh
[36:57] 10 or 15 minutes context or a text
[37:00] brother
[37:01] i want to call it the contest a contest
[37:05] is a test of strength and we
[37:09] um where we have a the uh
[37:12] test strength we used to have the idioms
[37:15] used to put a fire
[37:17] and they would put so many man on this
[37:19] end of the rope and so many on this
[37:21] end and the tug of war the contest of
[37:25] strength
[37:26] would pull the losing party across the
[37:28] fire
[37:29] and now uh we know there's many things
[37:34] and we could base this up on for a few
[37:36] minutes of
[37:37] of contest but i want to speak for these
[37:40] minutes
[37:41] quickly upon the greatest contest there
[37:44] is that's between the church
[37:47] and satan that great
[37:50] strength of satan
[37:54] and we want to speak of the great
[37:56] strength
[37:57] of god in his church now
[38:02] this great contest has been going on for
[38:04] many years
[38:06] it started in heaven and satan was
[38:09] kicked out
[38:10] into the earth and then he become an
[38:13] enemy to god's people
[38:17] and since then he's used all of his
[38:19] strength and his strategy
[38:21] to try to pull god's people
[38:24] across the fires or into his fires
[38:28] and we know that who has the most power
[38:34] god does amen and god when he gave his
[38:38] people the best thing that he could to
[38:41] combat
[38:42] satan with was his word now because the
[38:46] word
[38:47] is god and who's stronger than god
[38:52] so the word is god and
[38:55] the word becomes our
[38:58] strength god in the church
[39:02] becomes his strength to pull satan to
[39:05] his own fathers
[39:06] amen that he is made and the tug goes on
[39:10] now jesus said in mark 16
[39:14] in my name they shall cast out devils
[39:18] now i know that's an old uh
[39:22] uh saying that people or there is an old
[39:25] saying that
[39:26] and it's not so old either people don't
[39:29] believe in demons in this day
[39:32] but the thing to do to my opinion is
[39:35] know your enemy and
[39:38] and know your enemy and
[39:42] train uh for the contest
[39:46] that you're going to have when you meet
[39:48] him amen
[39:49] because you're going to meet him
[39:53] and knowing no is know what his strength
[39:57] is
[39:58] and then train for this contest when you
[40:01] do
[40:02] meet him or it's one thing sure
[40:05] you're going to meet him and so you
[40:07] train
[40:08] for the contest now
[40:13] training for a contest is just like a
[40:15] boxer
[40:17] his uh his uh
[40:20] enemy that he's going to meet out there
[40:23] in a contest to fight
[40:26] a real good fighter usually
[40:30] knows and studies his opponent
[40:33] studies his licks knows where he fights
[40:37] for worthy leans forward
[40:39] hangs back fights right-handed or
[40:41] left-handed
[40:42] he studies all this and then if he's a
[40:45] good smart
[40:46] fighter he gets him a sparring partner
[40:49] that'll fight just like his opponent
[40:52] fights
[40:53] for he'll know all these licks when he
[40:56] gets to that place
[40:58] and i think that's a very good thing for
[41:00] christians to do
[41:01] that's right and now if you want to
[41:04] start training start
[41:06] with john 3 16 the golden rule
[41:09] start right out with that and that'll
[41:11] get you on the floor
[41:13] and then train for the for the knockout
[41:16] punches
[41:17] because you're going to have to use them
[41:19] everybody knows that
[41:21] you have to train to hit your enemy and
[41:24] always
[41:24] god uses his words we must remember that
[41:28] god
[41:28] uses his word to defeat his enemy
[41:32] if god could think or could have give
[41:35] his people
[41:36] anything better to defeat the enemy with
[41:39] he would have done it so as i've always
[41:42] said
[41:43] when god makes a decision that's the
[41:46] best that there is he never has to alter
[41:49] his decisions
[41:51] so the first decision god gave his
[41:54] people
[41:55] in the garden of eden to combat the
[41:58] enemy was his word
[42:00] they were fortified with his word
[42:03] and now the enemy is going to study
[42:07] the are a strategy with the word
[42:11] and now satan studied that all out so
[42:14] perfectly though when he come to eve
[42:18] he had the best of strategy he could use
[42:21] up on her
[42:22] and that was to reason with the word
[42:26] now you never want to reason with god's
[42:28] word
[42:29] just believe it don't try to explain it
[42:33] don't try to figure it out now you
[42:35] cannot figure out
[42:37] god so god is the word and it's just
[42:40] made to believe
[42:42] and that's our strength just accept the
[42:44] word
[42:45] and anyone knows that a seed
[42:48] in the right kind of ground will produce
[42:50] its kind
[42:52] and we just take the word and now
[42:56] eve began to stop to reason when
[42:59] he she quoted the word to him and god
[43:02] said you
[43:02] should not eat thereof for the day you
[43:04] eat there out that day we die
[43:06] and satan never disagreed with her he
[43:09] said
[43:10] certainly that's right but he said you
[43:12] see you need some new light
[43:14] something a little different from what
[43:15] god said and if you do do it you'll be
[43:18] just a little smarter
[43:19] your eyes will be open but she said well
[43:22] god said we would die said oh surely see
[43:25] there
[43:26] you come just that much surely
[43:29] you won't die but god said you would
[43:33] and that settles it and that that broke
[43:36] that
[43:36] great tug of war
[43:39] then and pull the whole human race into
[43:42] death
[43:44] because eve listened to a reasoning
[43:47] against god's word
[43:50] now it's a shame that she did it
[43:54] but it's done past but now we're still
[43:57] fortified and that link was made up in
[44:00] christ jesus we know that
[44:02] god gave us our best defense just simply
[44:05] to trust his word
[44:06] you know in many say today that there is
[44:09] no such a thing as a devil
[44:13] ah they believe that it's just simply a
[44:15] thought
[44:16] they believe that and there's people
[44:19] that believe that
[44:20] that at the holy spirit is a good
[44:23] thought
[44:24] and the devil is a bad thought but if
[44:27] you notice when the bible speaks of the
[44:29] holy spirit
[44:31] he said when he the holy spirit has come
[44:34] and he's a personal pronoun see
[44:37] so he he is a person
[44:41] and the devil is a person and
[44:44] demons are persons amen yes they are
[44:47] demons and they they
[44:51] come in many ways but they think it's an
[44:53] old
[44:54] fashioned idea man was arguing me here a
[44:56] few weeks ago
[44:58] he said you know what you do you just
[45:01] set those people's mind to thinking
[45:03] something
[45:04] when you uh uh tell them that thing it's
[45:06] just a change of thought
[45:08] i met that very same thing
[45:11] in india one time one of those holy man
[45:15] there where we had i believe the largest
[45:17] audience i ever spoke to in one standing
[45:20] audience had been a half million people
[45:22] and i caught it by discernment
[45:26] in the spirit and they would see the
[45:30] holy spirit call
[45:32] people and call them out into the
[45:35] audiences and tell different things and
[45:39] catching their thought the rage olds and
[45:41] the holy man
[45:42] they said he's reading their mind
[45:46] so a few moments about five or six it
[45:50] passed through the prayer line
[45:52] and a blind man come through
[45:55] and he was totally blind and his eyes
[45:58] were as white as my shirt
[46:01] and i said now here is a blind man
[46:04] anyone can see he's blind and i said if
[46:07] i could help him i would do so
[46:10] but the only way i could do would be by
[46:12] a gift
[46:13] to maybe say something that he has done
[46:17] and that would give thought that if god
[46:20] knows what he has done
[46:22] he certainly will know what he's going
[46:23] to do
[46:25] so i said now looking at him i said now
[46:28] he's a worshiper of the son
[46:31] he's been blind 20 years and when the
[46:34] interpreter said it that was right
[46:36] i said he's a married man his wife is
[46:39] rather small and he has two sons one
[46:42] about seven one nine that was exactly
[46:44] right called their names what it was
[46:46] then out in the audience in the place
[46:50] where the
[46:50] people were there come that wave in
[46:54] its mental it's uh
[46:57] something on the order of of a psychic
[47:01] reading of their mind that i thought
[47:04] lord if you'll just help me
[47:08] i need your help lord these people
[47:12] are trying to places of telepathy
[47:16] and it's not and you know it lord
[47:20] yet i've given the scripture that's
[47:22] jesus said he did nothing until the
[47:24] father
[47:25] showed him and then turning to look at
[47:27] the man again
[47:29] i saw him just above there in a vision
[47:32] with just as good eyes as i am oh now
[47:36] is the time i said
[47:39] this man is a worshiper of the son
[47:43] now and he's gone blind i said now
[47:46] the there's the priest and
[47:49] there's the
[47:50] the priest of the sikhs jains and the
[47:52] different
[47:53] types of religion buddha now
[47:56] this man wants to receive his sight
[48:01] now you would say that he worshipped the
[48:04] creation instead of the creator
[48:06] i believe that too but here we set
[48:09] tonight
[48:09] i said and we've been today i was
[48:12] entertained in the james temple
[48:14] where 17 different religions
[48:17] was there to interview me and every one
[48:19] of them against christ
[48:22] everyone and i said now
[48:25] and many you men was down there now if
[48:28] christ
[48:28] is so wrong then this man wants to be
[48:32] right
[48:33] and surely the god of creation who made
[48:36] the world
[48:36] will be the only one who can give him
[48:38] his sight that's reasonable
[48:41] and i said now if any of you people
[48:44] the mohammed in here is the leading
[48:46] religion if the priests will
[48:48] come here and give him his sight then
[48:50] i'll follow
[48:51] or if the buddha priests will
[48:55] come
[48:55] give him his sign but let the god
[48:58] who made him the god somebody's got
[49:03] somewhere because there has to be amen
[49:06] we can't have a creation without a
[49:08] creator
[49:10] and it'll take a creator to create sight
[49:12] in his eyes he's been blind 20 years
[49:14] from looking at the sun
[49:15] thinking he'd go to heaven if he didn't
[49:18] a man ignorantly done that
[49:20] i said what would you buda priest do you
[49:22] just change his way of thinking you say
[49:24] he's wrong
[49:26] they worship their dead ancestors now i
[49:28] said now uh
[49:29] you'd think he was you'd say he was
[49:31] wrong but what would you do you change
[49:33] his way of thinking
[49:34] now i said what would the do
[49:36] change his way of thinking
[49:38] the six genes and so forth change your
[49:41] way of thinking i said we have the same
[49:43] thing in the united states
[49:44] the methodists all want to make all the
[49:46] baptists become methodists and
[49:48] the pentecostal wants to take all the
[49:51] methodists and make them pentecostals
[49:53] it's a change of thought
[49:57] but that's not what we're talking about
[50:00] we're talking about god the creator amen
[50:06] and i said surely the creator would
[50:09] speak and
[50:10] i wouldn't have said that if that vision
[50:11] hadn't been there by no means
[50:13] now i said now if the one that let him
[50:16] be god come give him his sight
[50:18] now i said now i challenge any priest
[50:21] or rachel or holy man or
[50:25] any of what it might be come giving me
[50:27] sight and i'll follow your philosophy
[50:29] you've made a convert that is the
[50:32] quietest
[50:32] bunch of people i ever heard nobody
[50:36] didn't
[50:37] i said what you so quiet about i said
[50:40] the reason you are is because you can't
[50:42] do it and neither can i
[50:44] but the god of heaven who raised up his
[50:47] son jesus christ
[50:49] whose servant we are has just showed me
[50:52] a vision that the man's going to receive
[50:54] his sights
[50:57] i said now if that beasts
[51:00] not so then you can order me out of
[51:03] india
[51:04] but if it is so every one of you owe
[51:05] your life to jesus christ
[51:08] i would like to ask you how many in here
[51:10] will give your life to christ
[51:12] if this blind man receives his sign you
[51:14] see your priest
[51:16] nobody comes up here why don't they come
[51:19] if they've told you the religion is so
[51:21] big and so great
[51:24] why don't somebody come and say
[51:25] something nobody come
[51:28] i said then you people out there if you
[51:30] see this blind man standing here
[51:32] and i've come a doctor to examine his
[51:35] eyes he shook his head he said he's
[51:37] blind
[51:38] and so i said certainly he's blind but i
[51:40] said if
[51:42] if god gives him his sight how many of
[51:44] you will serve jesus christ
[51:45] just as far as i could see uh oceans of
[51:48] black hands
[51:50] turned to the man and said lord jesus
[51:52] let it be known to dark god
[51:54] the man grabbed me around the neck and
[51:55] there set the mayor of bombay sitting
[51:57] there
[51:57] grabbed him around next see as good as
[51:59] anybody could what is it
[52:01] it's uh it's actually a power
[52:06] amen god is god
[52:10] and satan is satan
[52:14] if you don't believe in the devil when i
[52:16] first got started i i run
[52:18] headlong into him every day don't tell
[52:20] me there's no devil because i know
[52:22] better
[52:23] amen i have to fight with him every day
[52:27] so i know there's there is a devil
[52:31] and you must be trained when you're
[52:33] bleeding
[52:35] not trained in psychology not trained in
[52:38] education
[52:40] but trained by the holy spirit
[52:43] god's power in his word to make it
[52:47] manifest
[52:48] know your enemy oh what a
[52:51] cruel thing he is how i would like to
[52:55] stand here now
[52:56] and lay on to that go back to the bible
[53:00] and show you a man back there who come
[53:04] face to face with how in the contest
[53:08] against the enemy they fortified
[53:10] themselves
[53:11] by the word of god noah
[53:14] had an experience of it and he knew that
[53:18] god
[53:18] told him was going to reign and the
[53:22] contest was all between science and the
[53:24] word of god
[53:26] science says it can't happen god said it
[53:28] will happen
[53:29] amen hey man that same thing
[53:33] exists today it will happen
[53:38] it does happen
[53:47] and he gave his church authority to do
[53:49] so
[53:51] cast out devils in my name he cast
[53:55] seven devils out of a pretty woman one
[53:57] day
[53:59] and he said when the unclean spirit is
[54:03] gone
[54:03] out of a man he walks into our places
[54:06] returning back then
[54:07] bringing seven other devils with him now
[54:10] that goes to show
[54:12] that if the man was cleaned off devils
[54:15] there was
[54:15] something was in him that had gone out
[54:19] a devil had gone out hallelujah out
[54:23] when the devil moved out that god gives
[54:26] god an opportunity to move in
[54:28] amen amen so and when he goes
[54:32] out let the holy spirit come in don't
[54:35] just leave it there if you do just
[54:38] repent of your sins and go on then
[54:42] you're going to be worse off than ever
[54:44] but get that place where satan
[54:48] once lived and occupied get it
[54:51] filled with the holy spirit of god and
[54:54] that
[54:55] you'll have the strength of god's word
[54:57] in you
[54:58] manifested in cast out
[55:01] devils contest is
[55:05] amen the evening lights are shining
[55:09] god's holy spirit is present and now
[55:13] it's just about about three minutes
[55:16] until the time that the whistles are
[55:19] going to be blowing
[55:21] and it will be midnight then as we leave
[55:24] this building
[55:26] to go to our different places in our
[55:29] homes

[55:37] go as we have in former times amen
[55:40] let's go in the power of his
[55:43] resurrection
[55:44] let's go in the name of jesus christ
[55:47] with a banner lifted high and with faith
[55:50] in his word
[55:52] to handle the two eighth sword
[55:56] with the shield and the full armor of
[55:58] god on
[55:59] to beat the enemy because he's getting
[56:03] stronger and more powerful every day
[56:06] as a as the enemy comes in like a flood
[56:11] the spirit of god raises up a standard
[56:14] against him
[56:15] if we have come to the end of these
[56:18] things that we
[56:19] and the mysteries of god has been
[56:21] completed with us
[56:22] we are looking for more strength a

[57:08] bushes and the enemies
[57:10] are routing what an hour it must have
[57:13] been for david
[57:14] what a time for him laying there he
[57:17] didn't know
[57:18] how to move he didn't know what to go by
[57:21] because he knowed he was outnumbered
[57:24] but all at once he heard the sound
[57:27] of a wind going through the top of the
[57:29] bushes he know
