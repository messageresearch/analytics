TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and [Music] everyone welcome to church this morning Amen it's good to be here it's good to be able to worship the Lord and to keep our minds focused on things eternal and to keep sober to keep keep our direction and life correct it's very very easy to get distracted into other directions now sometimes you can go for weeks and realize I'm actually going in slightly the wrong direction here we get caught up in our projects or just our natural things and and the the things of God we still we're still a Christian but the things of God just get left aside a wee bit because our focus is on sort of a project we're doing or an ambition we might have or something like that we're just just on just natural things which is alright but we've got to always keep keep their balance in favor of the Lord keep the scales tipped it's the Christian walk is not really a a walk of balance it's not like I do this much of the Lord and I balance that out perfectly with all the rest of the things I do it's actually supposed to be always balanced than the Lord's favor and these other things just kind of take this spot and that's where we have a successful Christian life and the more of the Lord we have they actually the more balanced we actually become so that's what we want let's um let's stand this morning air let's dedicate this service to the Lord and it start with only half a band I mean let's and let's pray Heavenly Father we think we can be gathered in your house this morning to worship You Lord to acknowledge you the king of kings and Lord of lords to acknowledge you Lord that you're the king of our life and to Lord just make sure that our minds are always focused upon the things of you Lord that our life would bring forth fruit the Lord that it wouldn't be the the seed that you've that's growing in us wouldn't be choked by the cares of this life or the deceitfulness of riches are all those things Lord that can easily choke us out Lord but that our the the the Word of God that's dwelling in our heart Lord would have space to be able to bear fruit Lord as your word since some 20 some 30 some 100 may each one of us bear the fruit that you would have desired for us to bear Lord as your the great gardener Lord and that we'll be diligent to take heed of the things which we've heard from you Lord and apply them to our lives and and completely apply them to our hearts will me bless brother benasi ministers this morning may we may we receive him as the voice of God this morning Lord know that we don't come here just to play a game Lord but we we come here recognizing Lord that you're doing a mighty work and this time and this day in this place you're doing a mighty work Lord we want to accept it as that because when we receive it as that then it will be there Lord but if we if we don't receive it as that Lord then we will just receive it as manner will do us no good Lord but we we dwell in a supernatural realm it's not just a natural thing if you guys have decided to enter building in and you know get together and sing a few songs and do a bit of speaking it's not a natural club Lord but it's a supernatural event Lord that we're partakers of this morning so we want to make sure our minds are always focused on that Lord to receive these things as from the hand of God and from the mouth of God Lord and that we would continue to walk day by day growing and our spiritual walk getting stronger and stronger every trial of our faith would overcome the Lord faith would grow stronger Lord we don't ask for more faith you never see it you'd give us more faith law but you said you'd try the faith that we had and that the faith that we had would grow Lord so we just pray for a trial of our faith each week that we would we would our faith would increase the Lord that would become more and more like you Lord when you were here on earth you were 100% faith 0% doubt and Lord that's what we desire in our life Lord that we would be 100% faith and zero force in doubt just like you we Lord so we just want to come at the service to your hands this morning and just pray a blessing upon it in Jesus name Amen amen I had an well let's start with them let me walk blessed Lord in the way thou has gone it's a bit of a mix around but just in that praying that prayer you know that's actually what we want to do is walk like the way the Lord walked and they keep and we can if Christ is in us then that's very quite simple we just let that grow more than what our natural man let let let Christ let us have more control than the natural man does each day and will actually walk like him it's really not that complicated you know you don't have to be overly intelligent to be a Christian you know now I'm happy for that it means like you didn't you know but Peter was just an unknown fisherman but it's not about our intellect it's about our faith and how much we're willing to lace up what we know to make Christ living us

couple of announcements so brother our amande would like to speak to us all about the Christmas play so straight after service don't run away just wait here brother mom's going to speak to us and also in the hall so I mean so we've got Thanksgiving coming up and in the hallway out here is a sign-up sheet for what dishes to cook so so please can you fill out what you're gonna cook it's all there what you know the meals already arranged but just yes I know amen thank you very much for that looking forward to our Thanksgiving weekend we have a lot to be thankful for Alleluia amen if you've got your Bibles handy let's go to seeking Corinthians - I'll see if I can drive this thing there we go and then we're gonna go to Psalms 120 for a male just you'll love the Lord this morning I mean I trust you've all had a good week even if you've had a tough week it's still a good week because you still walk in faith that's a good week amen so let's go to sing Corinthians 2 and verses 9 to 11 it says for to this end also did I write that I might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient and all things to whom ye forgive anything I forgive also for if I forgave anything to whom I forgave it for your for your sakes for gay bi and the person of Christ lease Satan should have an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices and that's really what I want to speak on this morning but let's just go to Psalms 124 and I'm not sure who read this or where I heard this but I just love the scripture I mean and I just want to tie this into for a bit of a context Psalm 124 and and we're gonna read the whole Psalm I mean so he's here samms 124 and verse 1 if had if it had not been the Lord who was on our side now may Israel say now may the bride say because we're spiritual Israel if it had not been the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us then they had swallowed us up quick there are when their wrath was kindled against us then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul then the proud waters had gone over our soul blessed be the Lord who had not given us as a prey to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the Fowler the snare is broken and we are escaped our helpers in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth hallelujah may may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning I want to speak about we're not ignorant to the devil's devices I was I was going through this week about you know looking where we're all the believers failed you know it's a good big you know it's a good thing to actually look into because we should we need to study our enemy brother BAM says you've got to study your opponent we have a real opponent and and he's a slicker you can't you can't outwit him you can't you know out outthink him you know you can't defeat him and your own self he's a slicker brother bream says so so you need the Holy Ghost to defeat him right so but if Paul says were not ignorant of his devices then therefore we should study his devices and see how he works because if we don't if you don't study your enemy he'll just come in and just annihilate you and you'll be wondering how did I get to this place and you'll be his captive you'll be a you'll be a prisoner of war and but the thing is you will be actually willingly be a prisoner of war that's how that's how deceptive he is now so we are not but we're so we're not to be ignorant of his devices so we need to know then how he operates how he works and we need to know what his objective is so you must know your enemies if you know your enemy you will not be defeated you'll not fall into his traps and you won't be caught in his snare now we read there that the that the our souls are escaped as a bird out of the snare of the Fowler now if you look at trapping of any animal the animal has to agree to take the bait it has to agree to take the bait if it doesn't agree to take the bait it'll never be trapped so the devil his objective is to get you to agree with him and when you agree with him you take the bait and he never shows you the hook that's in the bait right so you have to agree with him and then he can take you now I want to show you this I'm gonna read it quote as we have this this is this is no man's land this is from World War one now we're just gonna leave it up there this is this is now this is no man's land this isn't a battlefield now brother perhaps isn't the greatest battle ever fought he says like when Israel went toward the Philistines now these I was comparing this with God and Satan fighting there was the hill on each side where they gathered and there that's where Goliath came out and called the called to the armies of Israel that's where David met him in the valley when he passed over the little creek that run between the two hills he picked up the rocks there has to be a place selected and Ernest it's a mutual ground it's called no-man's land right they fight here at this place they don't just they they just don't one fight over here and one over here and one over there there's a battlefront where they will meet and test their powers where each army test its strength against the other army a mutual meeting place he says now don't miss us now when the prophecies don't miss us you don't want to mess it right so don't miss this when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage of the place to be and for the battle to rage and the battle grounds begins in the human mind right that's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was to begin and that is because that's decisions are made in the mind the head now they never started from some organization they never started from some mechanical affair the grounds never started there therefore the organization can never do the work of God because the battle grounds where you've got to meet your enemies in the mind you've got to make your choices it meets you I want any any any any any year so he says it meets you now this is no-man's land now that pay is not very clear here but this was a building of some type these this is destruction this barbed wire there's you know there's many other photos you'll often see these dead bodies all kinds of things it's craters there's bomb holes it's just death it's just it ever this no man's land now I trust none of our minds are in this condition because the devil bombards through through a medium just like he used the serpent the serpent was Satan's medium to get to Eve the world the world uses the internet social media entertainment sport puts an image in front of you and it's trying to get you to agree with it and I'll bring it right down right now if the devil just gets you to agree with him that you know just come to church and be a good message believer without the reality of God in your life without knowing him then he's got you right you can be the best message believer there is no the quotes from from you know from the beginning to communion right to the end you can know the Bible to get him without the life and the word he's got you right so you got to go and beyond just being a good a good believer I mean but God has to come in you and manifest he's going to take the battlefield over hallelujah because in our minds it shouldn't be this kind of way it should be a manuals ground should be God living there with his life and peace not bloodshed and war and barbed wire and concrete and bunkers and death and you know that's not how it should be but if you this is not how our mind should be right a lot of death now don't know if I have this up here yes I do he says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be village vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world so now you know I read this I was thinking so the devil walks around like a roaring lion seeking whom a he devour have you ever seen him walking around have you ever seen him pretending to be a lion walking down the street have you ever seen him pretending to roar I'm a light I'm going to come to our people he never comes that way in it that's too obvious if you saw if you really saw demon power that's what they really look like if one would flee if they really saw lost spirits and you know demon that hatred and death and malice and strife and that means the other spreads behind worldly music and all the Oh murder and death no one would go near it they would flee as fast as they could but he never comes that way he comes nicely he comes he appeals to us sinners appealing whether you like it or not sinners appealing and God doesn't make us robots amen even with the Holy Ghost we still suffer temptation but there is a strong man in the house that overcomes that temptation hallelujah so you would have the strong man in the house now ooh before we go there so how does he devour comes across very innocently now the devil only depends perverts what God has done he is not original in anything he is the original copycat the devil is the greatest copycat there is right he so he does what God tries to do I mean no he tries to do what God is worried and he just perverts it he put something out there that's appealing now a sneer as I see it so one of our opening scriptures was our souls have escaped as a bird has escaped the snare of the Fowler now a snare is placed in an innocent-looking place and it's where the prey the thing you're trying to capture would would be so I'm not going to put a pig trap in the ocean to catch a pig a pig will never be in the ocean right it'll be where pigs go amen if I want to catch a you know I helped make a crocodile cake a cage and Papua New Guinea it was like as long about from here to the wall the saltwater crocodile would you know because it was eating people so this person's trying to make this cage to get it now if I put that on the road I won't catch the crocodile you got to be in its habitat the devil studies human beings he's very refined he knows you know he's not he's very targeted he's very smart God smarter though our God is far greater than him right but you know we can't underestimate our enemy so a sneer is placing it in its place an innocent-looking place where the prey words would frequent and there is something there that attracts them and in order to trap something you've got to get your prey to agree to take the bait without knowing what that is a hook or a catch that they can't escape now both the Lord Jesus and Satan are trying to make prisoners today Paul said I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ he yo and we God is looking for love prisoners when you fall in love with him even become a prisoner to his word because you love him rights are both Satan and God are trying to get prisoners you'll be a prisoner to one you'll be a prisoner to Satan you can be very religious you're still a prisoner to Satan or you'll be a love president Jesus Christ this word you'll be bound by the change of his word and you won't do your own will he will only do the will of his word right so there's only two but you have to it depends who you agree with that is the one that will get you right he says and so in John one he came to his own and his own received him not but as any is received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth so he had to he came but they didn't receive him many sympathized with them Nicodemus sympathized we know that our teacher come from God many sympathized with them but you can't just sympathize with the word you can't say well it makes good people they're nice this is wonderful yes it makes sense you can't you sympathize with the word or just say you believe it but have some reservations in your mind that's not receiving him if you've still got a bit of doubt in your mind of it's true or not you haven't received Christ and Christ is the word right you have to receive you can't just sympathize with the wood you've got to fully receive it fully agree with it see God is trying to get you to agree with his word and when you really really agree with him then you receive him right so you've got to fully agree with it and you do that and faith in begins to grow but if you have always this doubt in your mind and the devil always tries to put a question mark on the word what did he did to Eve we're going to go into even a little bit Sumba says yay hath God said he's a big giant question mark I'm going to put on your faith even a he's saying and that's what the devil wants to do you gotta kick it out you got to kick it out don't even stop and talk to the devil what even got to give to me oh hell well no I'm not gonna listen to you my lord jesus promised me a rapture and a spirit has quickened me to vindicate that I'm going in that rapture that is words alive so just listen to him it's worked so far I'm just going to continue hallelujah jesus said if you continue in my word than you're my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free there's a power and the truth to free anyone if they continue in the word hallelujah so now for the Bram says now it's always fundamentally the quick word of God the Bible every bit of its inspired and it's all God's Word and God is as in his word for so if God is in his word than if you received the word you receive God Amen now brother Brant sees in Pergamon church age he said he knew the only way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word I know I've said this before but just put it down to my age I'm getting older hallelujah if you leave that word you've left God that's how important just stay with the word that's why when brother Graham saw the preview of the bride and those ones were looking up on the wrong thing now looking at the sneers of the Fowler he screamed out stay in line stay in line with the word dismiss its work friends in a word I've seen it work in multiple countries it works it lives it delivers it heals and redeems and transforms we knew just stay with the word it's been vindicated God has identified himself with this word and he still identifies himself with this word so I say our God where do you put your seal of approval this message okay I'll stay with this hallelujah that's what we should do but the problem is influence of man comes in like Korah Dathan and Moses says to them well we'll see who's gods and who's not gods if the earth opens up if God does a new thing and the earth swallows you up then we'll see who is gods or not and God told them separate yourself from them the u.s. swallows them up you think that'd be good enough then shortly after that the people of Israel they get angry at Moses and Aaron and they say you have killed the people of God speaking of Korah Dathan you got read it in numbers that's how strong the influence was they actually thought that Moses and Aaron killed them but God was saying I identify myself with a group and it's not the ones that got swallowed by the world cause I got swallowed by the earth by the world God doesn't identify with those being swallowed by the world he identifies with those who stay with us saith the Lord so we want to stay with the word amen hallelujah if you want he says now thus he is presenting himself to the church at Pergamos and indeed to all churches of all ages I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word anyone or anything right that which I'm giving you the word as a revelation of myself I am the word remember that I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word now much I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with with the soldier on the battlefield which is the Holy Ghost in you I mean sometimes you're in battle they're you know they're pinned down they say we need reinforcements then the tanks come in the jet fighters come in and the enemy just gets blitzkrieg hallelujah the Holy Ghost is the ultimate one that you know a blitzkrieg is lightning war you know the enemy just yo comes in like the Nazis did in Europe they they just bombarded and pushed through and they conquered that is just a not even a it's just a small shadow of what God does he's the ultimate lightning war warrior hallelujah be got to agree with him you know we always have you know we'll always have mind battles whether you like it or not but it depends who you agree with do you agree with the doubt that makes you feel heavy I'm not talking about it's very different you know we can be convinced of sin convicted there's that kind of heaviness but then there's a heaviness of doubt coming it's two very different things and when the devil comes along has a mate doesn't make you rejoice does it stabilize your walk now destabilizes your walk well then you know well that's the serpent talking to you God doesn't destabilize he stabilizes he reinforced he increases faith he doesn't belittle faith he doesn't belittle his word he doesn't contradict his own word God can't contradict his own words I mean so he's the ultimate soldier on the battlefield we have to paint upon him in the battle in our mind amen now how do we pray cease let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayers and his name or there isn't any answer yet in 1st John 5:14 we're told this is the confidence we have in him that if we ask anything according to US will he heareth us and we know that he hears us whatever we ask we know that we have petitions that we desire from now we now we ask what is the will of God there's only one way to know his will that is by the Word of God lamentations 337 who is he that saith and it come to pass when the law commanded is not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask anything unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the word SAR Jesus the name is the word or the will you can't separate God in the word they are one now then this word he has left behind on printed page as a part of whom when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he says that his word was life John 6:63 the B part but is exactly what he is John 14:6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 8:9 is the B part of verse of any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his there it is he is spirit and his life that is exactly what the word is there's exactly what Jesus is he is the word and when a spirit born spirit filled man and faith takes the word into his heart and place it upon his lips why is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man if the church way back there in that Third Age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word and there metz the power of God would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word and faith and here we are we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in hermits again and it is hallelujah so that's how important it is you got to really receive the word amen you ought to agree with it now the serpent comes to Eve this is really what it all boils down to now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said yea if God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden questioned and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst the garden God has said you shall not eat of it neither touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know in the day to eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he didn't eat now I know brother Isaac went through this in great detail but it's just because it's part of it that's why it's here ok so Satan used use the serpent as a channel to get to Eve and it says in 2nd Corinthians 11:14 and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light so Satan always uses a medium to get to you and the first thing he did is he put a question mark on the word and he reasoned with her and he got her to agree with what he was tell so the devil just wants you to agree with him this is where the battle comes it's in here he wants you to agree if you you know so for example you've been having a tough walk with God recently it's thinking you got to look at what what is your thought pattern because if it's in your mind well I'm never going to overcome this I'm never victorious these people just don't like me I don't know if I'm even going to make it where did that thought come from you've got to really stop and you think we did that thinking where did that line of thought come from because it didn't come from here there's anyone found a scripture in here where where where that is no I'm more than an over and we are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus we're more than overcomers he paid it all we're victorious amen you know we've been redeemed we're being washed in the blood holy you know this Bible to the believer it's a it's a lovely - telling you you're gonna make it you've been redeemed I paid it all just give yourself to me and I'll do the work I've already done it just walking what I've done hallelujah that's that's what it says to me so you've got to think now well we did the line of thought coming saying well I'm never going to make it I'm not like this person how can I ever take a rapture that's the devil's thinking that's the devil trying to plant a seed in your mind that it will grow because you know brother bran was asked well how do I know if I'm thinking God's thoughts well God's thoughts or his word God that's it's really that simple is it God's Word or is it not God's Word but if you agree with that car thinking then you will become what you think you become I know brother David Silas said and he said you are your ambition so what you at what your ambition is to be is that that's what you'll become if you're a bum if you think well I just have no ambition in life I'm just floating through you know what will be what will be and Here I am and you know there's no point you'll become that but that thinking came from somewhere right and so but then if you have an ambition Lord I love you you've redeemed me I want to serve you with all my heart mind soul and strength because you're worthy not that I learn I'm not looking to earn anything but because I love you I want to serve you I want to be a real believer then you'll become that because that's your ambition in life right so you've got to it depends what you agree with if one if one with me you got to watch you know because many times it's our our voice in our heads because the devil gives you you know he gives you thoughts and he makes you on them and then he condemns you for having them amen Hey everyone has who's ever had a mind battle before if you're honest you'll put both hands up right everyone has them I mean the believers down through the ages just because you got a mind battle doesn't mean you're not a believer that's irrelevant The Devil's guns are on you you know that's just how does he bombard you he wants you to derail your faith but who are you accepting what he what are you accepting are you accepting God's Word or you're accepting hallelujah the devil's lie now but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished it bringeth forth death the fall in the garden happened in the mind Eve had to agree with the Serpent's lie it was conceived in here then it was manifested just like everything every sin upon the earth it starts in here right and the thing is the problem is we are born wrong we are born with a sinful nature we are born agreeing with Satan whether we like it or not that's how we're born that's why you're going to be born again you got to be renewed your spirit your human spirits got to be cleansed it's got to be changed the Lord Himself has got to descend and come into your soul and take over amen I'm glad he does hallelujah so it all starts in the mind now they should be as I see it I think I seen it before the believer will still be tempted you know sometimes we think well when we really meet him in the battles over now the battle really just begins the battle really just begins when you meet him you take Israel the Bell will really started when they cross Jordan wasn't in the wilderness they had some battles they overcame whatever happened but it's Whitney cross Jordan then the fighting really began but when they walked the courting met Joshua was told to meditate upon the whole Word of God that was given and he quoted Moses to the people and he meditated upon it and God said if you do this then you'll be successful who wants to be successful in their Christian walk Lord I want your victory to be manifested in my life meditate upon his word he say well then and that's the problem these days this world is full of information we live in a hyper Information Age you know we're bombarded continually I've got notifications and junk email and this social media and the news and all these things you know we I have the same I don't know who the richest man in the world is these days I think the guy who owns Amazon doesn't matter I have the same 24 hours he does right he doesn't have more or less time we have the same amount of time but it's how we use our time right what are you giving yourself to whatever you give yourself to you'll become that people give themselves you know to all kind of demon spirits they manifest that spirit right but you got to look at now what are you giving yourself to but as I say that we are still the believer is still tempted even with the Holy Ghost in their lives because we're still living in these bodies that's why we need a body change and that's why we're all going to rejoice when these bodies have changed thank God I'm not in this pest house anymore thank God has been transformed hallelujah amen through it so you know so we still be tempted cuz we're in this we're still living in these bodies but the Holy Ghost should be in us that when the enemy comes in like a flood he'll raise up a standard and there'll be alarm bells begin to set off there should be alarm bells you know I you know there's this very old we used to watch called lost in space there was a family that was stuck on some planet and there was a robot that like protected and then whenever there is danger this robot will go danger Will Robinson is like this root yo he's one of the characters you know hit hit be the alarm bell going off this danger Will Robinson it's like the hologram so it's a very crude illustration but that's like God you begin to walk because he's your shepherd the shepherd sees and understands and knows way more than sheep and so when the enemy comes around the Shepherd should begin to say unto you be careful the devil's nearby stop looking at that stop feeding on that thing stop letting it consume your mind hey there should be a warning bell going off that is wrong that is Satan's I mean that's why you know people look at stuff yo even even just the news you know we you know we saw or Hollywood's evil of course it's evil but then you go read the news and this person killed this person this person murdered these people this person mutilated this and you're like why did I just fill my head with all that you know you think about it does it really did I really need to know that no is it good you know nothing but the Word of God for this day will give you rapturing faith rap stirring faith is in the Word of God and has endless messages rapturing faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God so God is giving us rapturing faith through his word I mean the news does not have rapturing faith right anything outside the Word of God has no rapturing faith amen so we're going to think about what am i filling myself with hallelujah I want to give God something to work with don't you yes a lord I want to take your word in and you can ignite it with your Holy Spirit and it'll live hallelujah see you got to look at what do you want I want to see God live I want to see you manifest himself I want to see him do things that you know no one's ever really seen before don't we want them to live there's another the greatest joy that believer Lord you live today not that you're going by you know the true believer doesn't you know the true believer doesn't care if their name is mentioned the Apostle Paul was taken up into the third heaven he said on your men and it was him but he didn't want to be all look at the Apostle Paul no he want to give glory to God that's how we and and when you hear brother Bram talk about the account of going to South Africa and what happened at Durban racetrack and the supernatural you hear his account you hear Sidney Jackson's account and when I heard the two I thought that sounds like they're talking about two different events they're talking about the same event but brother bang cuz it was him he kind of downplayed it a little bit cuz he wasn't he didn't want to draw attention to himself Oh hasten the day where we just want to wrap a curtain around ourselves the world doesn't see us right they should go cuz we you know we know that we don't want to be lifted up that's the man yeah that's man's doings I want to become something though I want him to become something I want him to live that's the main thing it doesn't matter if we're not even a footnote in history who cares as long as he lives that's the most important thing so the Holy Ghost should come and he should set off alarm bells when there's something not right he sees in John 16:8 and when he has come speaking of the Spirit of Truth he will reprove which means to convict convince telephone rebuke the world and of righteousness and of judgment so the Holy Ghost should be in your life telling you when you're stepping out of line amen we're led by ya my sheep know my voice I mean so there should be something in you which should tell you something is not quite right right and it should come down into religion especially you know I saw a I saw a clip on Facebook a short two minute clip over there was a convention in Switzerland very recently this last month and the people are rejoicing they look like believers they were singing but something in me didn't feel quite right and in the worship leader whoever was here begin to say you are the holy ghost you are charity and house although there it is we are not the holy ghost he is the holy ghost than us you're right but there should be an alarm bell because it's always the 30 inch thin edge of the wedge I mean where it comes down but there should be a voice in you saying no or yes Amen don't you try in God's leadership Jesus says in John 16:13 and lead us not into it this is from a model prayer lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil Luke 4 1 and 2 I'm just using these to show that we're still tempted Jesus when did his temptation come look for verses 1 and 2 and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan he just got baptized and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he didn't eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered in down in verse 13 of Luke 4 and when the devil had entered all the temptation he departed from him for a season so it's amazing the spirital you know the Holy Ghost fills Jesus Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodies in a man where does that spirit lead him into temptation I mean I mean in sorry into the world miss to be tempted of the devil isn't that interesting that's the same thing with you and I you know God wants to prove his salvation God wants to prove his protection God wants to prove his deliverance I mean that we are not just free we're always free amen that's what he wants to prove he wants to prove that no spirit no weapon formed against you shall prosper there's a lot of weapons he forms but they shall not prosper hallelujah you know for the devil to have devices he must have multiple devices he's not a one-trick pony he's not a one-trick pony he's got a multitude of weapons in his arsenal but they all boil down the unbelief of the Word of God however it comes amen so now it's just oK we've got this ice Tollison brother on moliro site now this is a diagram of of you so we have here this is your body the outer ring is the body this is the this is how your body contacts the world feel taste here smell and see that's the five senses yeah and then your spirit now an it but then you have a spirit realm and that's contact by reasoning conscious imagination of fiction and memory yes none those contact God you don't contact God by feeling you don't I'm just you may say well this is very elementary but I want you to think about it you don't contact God by taste or by here only right smell or see remember the Pharisees heard the same word jesus said as the disciples did it didn't give them faith and then the memory reasoning conscious those things it's faith God gave you faith to contact God faith now and these are all the outside influences of the world now I want to deal with memory I want to deal with three memory a fiction and imagination because or really all these things but mainly these three feed off each other very well they feed each other very well now your memory and I've gone to later but what you remember you gotta think now you've got to be real careful this way you've got to be a steward of you steward of your mind right you don't just let anything walk in and walk out a man who has no control over a spirit is like a castle without walls or sitting without walls season proverbs so if you have no control over this you have no defense now your memory what memories are coming up in your mind are they good memories or bad memories we all have both some of us have very traumatic memories right some of us do some of us but we all have some good memory somewhere but if you are feeding off bad memories then your imagination will start running wild and then what your affections are resting upon if you're feeding off bad memories then your affections will be set on those bad memories right are you following me and your imagination will be caught up with those so what are you thinking on you know you know what we should think on the day Jesus found you that's a good memory that's the best one the day Jesus found you is the best one the day Jesus redeemed you reveal himself to you that was the best day hallelujah whatever your newborn when you were born the second time that birthday is the best birthday you should remember that one whenever we are all this happened to me this happened to me because remember this how you feed how these things feed you feed on them will actually control how you speak to people how you deal with people how you are in your life depression starts from bad memories right and then that spirit comes in and then your affections imaginations are feeding on that depression amen I'm just taking the negative because but then we go to the positive Allu you 10 years ago in September I met him he washed all my sins away I knew that I knew that I knew I became a new creature holy and he saved me and he began to work the work he started he'll perfect that means I'm silted at the end and then makalah receive His Holy Spirit of my soul I'm sealed to the day of my Redemption I'm going in a rapture I wonder what the rapture is going to be like it's gonna be a sweep and we're gone holy the Prophet said that the life and you of God will is the powder rapture your soul the believer already has the power to go glory hallelujah so we're going to disappear and then I'm going to be dancing on streets of gold I don't I wonder what that's gonna be like it's gonna be glorious hallelujah I'll be in time I'll ever in them holy holy it's gonna be wonderful and then he's going to come out we should imagine these things because one day it won't be an imagination we'll be a reality hallelujah and it's so glorious because you begin to think now I wonder what it was like on the day of Pentecost where God came down and filled them but then you go back to your memory I remember being felt so I know what that presence was like I know what that experience was like because I was there hallelujah I wonder was like when Moses parted the Red Sea I know what he's patted my Red Sea and he and he brought me through in the enemy was drowning I danced yeah I mean that's why it's so glorious this is why this becomes a personal love letter because you can identify with the acts of God from Genesis to Revelation lujah and then and then what does that do with your affection Oh Lord you're so glorious I love you so much your see your fictions are seat on the things above hallelujah but then these things now this world feeds on imagination and affection the world is actually very aggressive it bombards us whether we like it or not we're bombarded by the world it puts an image down tries to put an image down your throat you've got to be like this you've got to live the Kiwi dream amen you've got to form into this kind of parameter and if you don't there's something wrong with you and the pressure comes on I don't fit in no the believers never fit in when if they ever fit in do you think Noah fiddling in the days of Noah he didn't fit in Moses didn't fit in Abraham didn't foodon mentioned meeting him just say you're you know you're a tourist and you're going through the Promised Land whatever was cool back then and you meet this guy Abraham how are you my name is Abraham you know oh where are you from I'm just a pilgrim and a stranger what what do you mean you you here on holiday no I'm just a pilgrim and a stranger I'm looking for a city whose builder and maker is God I haven't seen that on the map you think that guys have been different we're gonna have a baby we can have a baby share alone leave my wire and we're gonna have a baby hey you bigger thing something's a bit different I think he needs help he needs medicating but no he received a promise and their bodies would change young again hallelujah and they received the promised son hallelujah glory to God so now we're all you know we're a we're a oddball brother MCS that we're an oddball to the world or but in the world as an oddball to us I mean they think well that well you think we're we're weird the world is strange to us why can't they just receive it and rejoice and shout and be believers that hallelujah and why do they be steered by all these things just walk with God it's way better so we think they're on don't you hell yeah so now those two feet off each other now he says so this isn't the greatest bear liver Ford he says what was the matter you had to open the channel first the devil wants to get in in some way it's just like you know before you get married you will always still be times you always like someone who's with me now we're gone quiet liking the opposite sex is natural right it's normal you built that way we're not robots you don't suddenly become a robot in something I do and then you get feelings then you love no you get them before you say I do there's got to be have a bit of a spark abut a chemistry amen amen if you don't feel love but you say you love you don't love it's just lip service something you've learned you got to feel it love is a feeling hallelujah glory but so it's normal to like boys to like girls girls like boys it's normal right it's normal but then the devil will take that and bind you to someone if you open yourselves completely to them right he'll try and sneer you in with that so you've got to guard your heart but it's normal to like someone oh but I like them you like someone else maybe a couple of days later and you won't like that person I like this one that's why and that's normal but that's why you've got to pray a bit when the Lord is that one that's a different story hallelujah we're here to God amen is that okay yep so it's normal to like the opposite sex but just because you like them doesn't mean they're there they're your soul mate and you've just got to be careful because then your imagination of fishing can begin to run wall or you get some attention from someone you feel special of course you do but the devil will take that he comes a sucker punch and you find yourself doing things work you know that that you'll regret later so you gotta be careful but the world trying to put it down your throat because the world does not show people the emotional damage the spiritual damage that happens when relationships happen outside of marriage it doesn't show it doesn't show the scars you know I know I've said it before but you take Hollywood it just shows you this much of the picture and this much of the pictures glamor and success and money and fame and pleasure and things but then if you just pan the picture this way there's death drugs suicide depression emptiness broken marriages all those things but he doesn't want you to he never see but that see there's the bait you can be like this person I don't want to be like those people they can do that they could have that I've got Jesus I'm a lot happier with him because he doesn't because with the Christian life see the devil wants to show all this person to this and this happened this happened but then you just got a pen his camera eternal life hallelujah streets of gold no like a fire Amen so we want to be that you know don't you got to guard these things now he says what's the matter you've got to you had to open the channel first so you've got are these are gateways and the devil wants to take up residence the devil thinks that you are his house when a evil spirits cast out of a man right if one doesn't drive places then it comes back and brings seven of its friends finds the place swept says I'm gonna return to my abode devil thinks that he actually you are his dwelling place that's what the devil thinks but you're not the dwelling place of the devil you are in the place of God's rest you're the place of his abaya a boat hallelujah so now but he wants to get you he wants to get you in he wants to let you in I mean he wants you to let Herman just like it sneer you got to agree with the snare I was watching a video of of a bird snare and there's these birds and and maybe I should have shown it but you know there's these birds is the steer on the ground look so innocent there's all this feed around and they're there they're eating this walking around and then some of them try to fly away and they're caught they can't get out what happened they opened they agreed with the bait and they got Snead and he wants the devil wants you to agree with his bait that he will take up residence or he will oppress you because if you open a door then he's got access and he can he can take your memory and beat you down it can take your affections your imagination your conscious your reasoning and beat you down with it but then when you let the Lord in he's got to be the soldier on the battlefield and he's never lost a battle Amen see he had to open the channel first one of these channels you've got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit place at the battle front to take God's Word he is the word and he stands there and there's nothing going to stop him there's nothing can every one of the other channels is cleared out just like the old boiler with the flue stopped up you put a fire it'll blow a blow your thing up that's what's the matter of so many blowed up Christians is because they don't clean the channels out they don't get down to the inside you've got to clean it conscious memory thoughts laying aside everything and coming from inside out with that unadulterated Word of God that it's the truth no matter if 10,000 died on this side today trusting 10,000 on that side tomorrow trusting that has nothing to do with me I'm an individual I'm the one that's trusting I'm the one that believes it so it doesn't matter what happens anyone else I'm the individual I'm the one believing I'm the one trusting right and you see back yonder if you want to open up our channels then if we can and see and find this one in that one and this one and that one thousands of them testifying but the devil will try and come right back Olu he's not a gentleman you show him the door he doesn't walk out nicely he goes out kicking and screaming amen but the Holy Ghost binds them up kicks them out I mean that's why you never say now mr. devil can you leave my family alone oh you got to stand on your god-given rights you would have prevailed in prayer you were talking about Wednesday with the errors of deliverance keep striking he said I don't know how many times our strike you say God you strike the arrows threw me on the ground until it's done because the Lord will say the other battles won it's done you know that peace that comes when you pray through you understand I trust you do amen now he's the one yeah but the devil try and come back see if he could get in there at all he's got your army routed then if he's got your census see taste feel smell in here they're all right but don't trust in them unless they agree with the word that's all right but if they agree with the word I mean but if they disagree with the word rather don't you listen to them now imaginations conscious memories reasonings affection they're alright if they agree with the word that's our thing about you know about your your thinking being well you're just never going to make it that's not agreeing with the word Amen but if your but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it you blow a flue right quick if your reasoning disagrees with the would get away from it that's right I mean the memory if your imaginations if you're conscious anything disagrees with that what's on the inside get rid of it what you got then you've got a solar system hallelujah God set the Stars in order and said hang there till I call you you they stay there nothing's going to move them when God can get a man in his hands till he can get his senses as conscious everything cleaned out until it stands with God behind in the in the soul there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there that's right if he can come round say you don't feel any better your conscience has even gone to that your flus are so cleared out it shouts hallelujah the old Liat blows a whistle glory to God it sounds out certainly it's just as clean and clear for the Word of God to work through the power of God see it's the main thing there's your battle ground your battle ground is back here at the beginning back here and the spirit back in your mind that opens I mean I mean the mind is the is the gate to the spirit your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit you can't have little consciences and little feelings little sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it it's just a scent little sensation and thinks but when it really when your mind really opens up your mind either accepts it or rejects it see the mind of people here either accepting what I'm saying or rejecting it and one part of ridiculous you're thinking about something else because the devil comes in I remember when I was in a Pentecostal church I never had my metal sitting in service but then I went to the mrs. Church there's all kind of mind bells going on give was trying to Oh next weekend tomorrow and you've got to do this and what about this and this person did this and you're just going to say shut up I'm listening be quiet quiet in the cheap seats I'm listening that's what you got to do you don't get a silence that voice be quiet devil I'm listening to the Word of God because it's got rap string faith for me it's not for you maybe if you listened to it in the beginning you would have stayed where you should have been right so of course you live mind battles but just just come don't worry about tomorrow and what about this at all your imagination is running wild don't pull it down pull it down because this way you come in those doors start swirling hundred miles an hour then you leave the doors now it goes back to normal and it happens next Sunday and next Wednesday it just repeats and you've just really found yourself I've been sitting in here but never been here you don't just want to be present and body you want to be present and spirit and body amen that's what I'd do if I was you amen because it's your soul ultimately what do you want to get out of God what do you want amen I want him I want everything he has for me I want to see it live I don't just want to talk about it I don't just want to stand over Jordan shouting saying the land is there I want every part of the land I want to take not just take Jericho the seals opened up the lands oh but I'll take every part of the promised land I want all the joy there is all the peace all the long-suffering on the character of Christ I want his divine nature in me I want caps I want the cap said of divine love upon my life with faith faith and virtue of patience meekness brotherly Titus all those things I want that manifested in me that's what I want I want the Holy Spirit to come and manifest those virtues in my life don't you want to be made in His image to be like Jesus oh all I want to be is be like him who wants to be like Jesus who wants to be made in His image look that's why he died on Calvary - making people in His image that's why seeing a transforming word the power of transformations and this message that you'll be transformed made into his image I want to be like that oh if he's done that why say well I'll just do it what you're why not why not become like him I'd rather become like him than become like the devil because the devil has nothing to give to me Allu you he's on the ever had brokenness and disappointment heartache sorrow and pain and regret that's all he's given his people and he uses them and he just throws them to one side and then he and he passes anointing down to someone else that's not how God works God takes his bride fills her with his love redeems her and then once they're done once he's used her on the earth to manifest himself she goes up into glory hallelujah and then now she's waiting for the rest of the bride to come to her their position and then we're all going to be there hallelujah so we're not just at all like the devil uses people he just throws them in the trash no we're not that kind of people your your God's joy your God's purchased position you're his treasure you're his jewel in his crown hallelujah that's what you are to God amen no it was I so now he says see you either accept your mind or either accepts it or a jig so that's it friends God let none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens up the door closes the door and listens to your conscious listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of us would come in it blows the rest to the stuff out hallelujah every doubt has gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the Word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know its truth these battles have raged since the days of the Garden of Eden the battles and the my human mind Satan started it what did he do when he met Eve he didn't deny God's Word but he whitewashed it amen and he's whitewashed it in this day God's a good God it's all grace grace is a divine nature a divine of influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life go look at the Bible definition of New Testament grace amen I'm glad we found grace in his sight Evan say think and and we know through these battles of rage buddies whitewashed it he stopped up some little channels here some day said surely God surely you won't die but he knowed the wood was right but he but he knowed he couldn't just come right out and blast it away so he sugar-coated it that's what he does now the first time I just hurry through this let's go let's just jump forward a bit now in Psalms 26 now no I want to leave this up here Sam's 26 1 2 3 says judge me O Lord for I've walked in mine integrity I have trusted also in the Lord therefore I shall not slide examine me O Lord and prove me try the reins of my heart for thy loving-kindness is before my eyes and I have walked in my truth now the reins when he talks about the reins and our brother and he brought this out in the subconscious serious that he did but the reins drive just like you know there's a rider on a horse they have the reins of the horse and they drive where the horse should go amen so now the reins of your heart is what whatever takes the reins of your heart is where you're going to go so if the Holy Ghost is in you and he's taking control of your life he's got his hands on the reins and now driving you I'm glad to be his his noble steed if I look like a donkey but his noble steed I mean you know but but but he takes a hole but then the thing is you have to agree with him to take the reins you've got a surrender the reins over to him and then he takes them but then if you begin to agree with the devil just like I said about depression bad memories feeding into depression and those things what's happened that's taking the reins of your life and you begin to be something that you weren't before that happened to you amen so now you don't want to so you got to see what takes what takes the reins of your heart now this this world as man's imagination is running wild today this day's full of superheroes cosplay Hollywood works on captivating the imagination of the people this is what the devil tries to work through through the eyes to capture your imagination that's what he's trying to do and then so if we can do that then he'll steer you the way he wants you to be steered and it's never a good place the world has become a fantasy world no one wants to live in this reality very few are happy with just living in this rally they all have an escape right it's either because they cannot handle everyday life that's why people bury themselves and pleasures and drugs and entertainment or a hobby because they're trying to escape this present world amen that's why people bury themselves on the internet it's called the World Wide Web it's a snare it's sent to steer people the World Wide Web right and you have you ever watched something land on a spider's web and the more it moves the more it attracts the attention of the spider and so what happens is you know the problem is we have this I can be in heavenly places or I can be in the very depths of Satan's Eden and he'll just with a swipe it's very easy to do and I'll be and that affect me you saw all those things don't affect me well you're a robot you're in self-denial oh I can look at Hollywood and all the violence and all the sex and all those things that are wrong it doesn't I've got the Holy Ghost no it'll affect you it sure will be searing your conscience and it will prevent your imagination you can't because we're all human the only difference between you and the guy on the street is the Holy Ghost in your life when you're both we all have the same five senses we all have the same gate yo gates into the spirit realm but the difference is the Lord has taken up residence and he's made you a new creature right so you you got to be looking at qibla what you look at because this whole world you know we are the most drugged up society has ever been you say well I've never taken any illegal drug I've never even taken a drink or smoked a cigarette social media in this world is the same effects because it fills you with dopamine it's instant pleasure who's ever looked into it it's an instant pleasure because that's why people feed off it so much is because it produces the chemical dopamine in your body which makes you feel happy and you become addicted to it and that's why people get Internet addiction right because they're feeding off that thing they're an addict that's why I think it's what should be in this country too but overseas they have rehab centers four four four internet gamers because they get so addicted their whole life is caught up in the thing they need to actually go cold turkey they need a rehabilitation program to get off that screen get off that game and become a normal person again it's a drug same with movies music whatever it may be there's a spirit behind it many people do not see this they don't see the sneer those just see the bird feed and their body craves it because Satan knows how you're built I mean God knows how you built - and his spirit is far more powerful than any work of the enemy right you may be caught in a snare today he can break the snare he and set you free right so I don't want you to sit there saying well I'm stuck I'm stuck now you don't have the me start call upon the name of the Lord you shall be save you show me deliver it hallelujah don't have the Sydney with us there you've seen a you know you don't have to just sit back and say well I've been trapped we've all been trapped by something even pride and your walk with God can be a snare where self probably well I'm just the best message person who's ever been in the face of the earth you know that's pride you're actually you worshiping yourself that's a snare God can you someone who's proud and they walk with God it should make us more humble Oh Lord you would reveal yourself to me of all people you'd come down and say Here I am I'm your Redeemer hello you're part of me that should make you so humble I'm going to tell God comes down since I'm going to tell you secrets their prophets looked into you you know I think I read it last Sunday or whenever it was Daniel was praying when are these things gonna be I don't think it was just a just a Lord Jesus Oh almighty Almighty God Jehovah can you tell me when these visions are gonna be fulfilled amen and walk on he would have earnestly been pray I want to know when is this going to happen he just saw the vision from the time to the end when's it gonna happen he would have been earnestly seeking God Lord I want to know and God says no it's not for you to know and then God comes to you the things he wanted to see and all the prophets I'll tell you well the RAM comes across a mystery God revealed I'm gonna tell you what was in the back parts of God's mind before the from the foundation of the world that many who had a longing to know and here he comes he says I'm going to tell you it because God gives it to him and then you just press play and it becomes more than a sermon it quickens to you becomes alive though I was revealing what he sang to you you hear what he's actually saying in your soul he quickens it to you and many people wanted to see it and they weren't privy to it hallelujah isn't that wonderful for you say it's not fair God's sovereign people actually do not understand God is sovereign no one is his adviser he redeems too he will he quickens who he will he saves her he will he raptures who he will it's his prerogative and no one can say why did you do that he says because I said so I'm the final court of law I'm the supreme judge I do what I want Oh Luke and that's why I'm so glad he found me because he chose me there's a reason he saved you you have a purpose upon the earth amen No so people who get hooked up on things because they're trying to escape this present world see it all feeds on these imagination affection and memory don't be an addict whatever you do be an addict of Jesus Christ hallelujah whatever you do you say well I'm not hooked up on some drug but then what about yuning to go back to a simpler time of life that's why the devil can use our memory and I know this is very true I've battled through this you yearn for a simpler time of life is it either just me now some of you look at me like what are you talking about no we all yearn don't you and then you see people who like you know they live off the land they go off the grid and they grow all this stuff and they have and and something in you says wouldn't that be nice because it's simpler but the only reason you yearn for it is because you want a simpler time of life then what happens now as you begin living and not reality because your yearning for something that's not where you are right now oh yeah isn't that right so we so we don't want to be caught up in something that we do not have well you know in the world people chase money they chase all kinds of things and I think when they get that then know that they've arrived and they find they're still in the same place who has ever climbed a mountain and you climb a root you see a ridge you think that's the summit and you get to that Ridge and then it's like five more ridges pass there who's ever who's ever did that this is that's how the world is they say I just need to get here and they get there and they realize no they haven't really got anywhere because this has been anointed see it's your imagined so and then what happens if people so if they if they have you ever longed for a simpler way of life or they want to escape into a hobby or go live on a desert island or something that becomes the center of their lives and they become living they may be president body but they're not president spirit because their mind is often in another place and they actually neglect what's actually there in front of them today is the best day of my life hallelu cos God all day this is a day the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it this is whatever conditioner and it's the best day of your life because this is where God wants you to be now just like Israel they came out of Egypt that was a great day that's not the day but then they went through a whole bunch of stuff every day was better than the previous day because if God wanted to keep them on the one side the Red Sea they would have stayed there but they to continue in their journey same thing with us so don't let your imagination so that that thing that people so if you're caught up in something that becomes the center of your life and that's your imagination leading you brother branham after the opening of the word opening of the seals because of the rejection and the strain and the hurt that it caused he wanted to move his family up to northern British Columbia become a guide and whenever God would tell him to tell him something he'd just stomp out the world and say thus saith the Lord then go back cuz he always wanted to be a hunter so now in his mind this is what he wanted to be because of hurt now I'm gonna hurry through this last bit but it's because of hurt those things begin to happen because he was rejected Christ himself was made known mysteries of the word had become open and he said and even see what he's preaching it thousands of my friends will leave me because of this and they did and it hurt him cuz he's a man he's an adopted son of God he received God molded him through many things to receive the word in his hand to preach the dispensation of gospel for the end time so he's an adopted son of God but yet things that happened to him affected him and he lost his love for the people because of it so I'm saying just because we have the Holy Ghost we may be adopted in our place in the body doesn't mean we're not immune to these things amen but then the Lord dealt with him and then you know he went back on the field he got his love back for the people no see it's here and Luke for how he how was everyone how are you because you can't talk for the person x3 how are you guys doing you good how are you can I continue do you mind do you yourself mind because I want to bring this to the end now Luke 4 it says and there were delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah so remember the wounding listen the wounding in the spirit is far worse than the wounding in the body right because you can you can be a but yet rejoice right but if you're a in your spirit that's a lot worse you can have full function of your body but if you're hurt and wounded in your spirit then you won't be able to rejoice and serve the kingdom serve the Lord like you could do so the wounding in here is where we need the Lord Jesus really to come right and so he says now this and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sites of the blind and to sit at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all that are in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this day as the scripture fulfilled in your ears so when the Son of Man Jesus Christ the Son of man when he came into his ministry this was his ministry to to heal the brokenhearted preach at liberty to preach deliverance to the captives and their covering at a sight to the blind to see it at liberty them that are bruised this is the ministry of the son of man right and that same ministry has repeated in the same time I mean this day the scripture is fulfilled hallelujah where God would come again with the same Ministry of the anointing would come hallelujah that people would be sit at Liberty that are bruised their site would be recovered they would be delivered that a captive he'd heal the brokenhearted that's what the message does that's what the message does hallelujah we have the medicine hallelujah hallelujah Amen we have where dr. Moses's medicine kit I'm the law of the hills all thy diseases amen so now so I'll just leave it up there not to be broken the wood so brokenhearted so to heal the brokenhearted so broken it means to crush completely that is to shatter to break in pieces broken to shivers to bruise and the heart is the thoughts or the feelings it's the mind so this can be broken this can be shattered right there can be shattered this can be broken to a million pieces but the Lord said I'm here to heal the brokenhearted that if your memories broken it's fixed on one thing he can healed it your affections are on the world on not him he can healed it your imaginations always negative against people different things negative about yourself brother and when he came to a time when he's dedicating himself again to the Lord he sees a Lord I surrender my negative thoughts amen the Lord can heal that your conscience is gone you have no alarm bell your reasoning is gone your reasoning has walked he can put that back together oh I'm glad he meant deliverance to the captives is more than just being captive to sin he says this in God's provided way 1953 and he sit and he sit down like that his weary eyes rolled over looked around and I thought oh god that's a heavenly Birds he's talking about an eagle and a cage though I thought oh god that's a heavenly birdie soars in the heavens above here he is court he fell into a trap he's absolutely helpless he can't deliver himself his weary eyes rolling around I felt so sorry for him he can't help himself and every man that's fell into the snare of the devil is worse off than him you're a heavenly being you're supposed to be a son of God you're free brother got liberty in Christ Jesus believing God loving God living free from sin free living free from death that's right but how the devil has caught you and catch you up with smoking now listen to this list because the first part we think well that's that's obvious it's a cage case you're above smoking drinking all kinds of immoral living and thinking you're popular thinking you're doing something so we can be thinking we're doing something and we're actually just on a hamster treadmill trying to be thinking you're popular thinking you're doing something that can be a snare or a cage you're following me when you think about it because we can be led this is the deception comes in the devil used scripture in the beginning that was perverted but he used 99% of a verse and it brought death now we can be caught up in things that appear to be the truth appear to be the Word of God and our fictions are set upon it because we want to serve Him but actually it's a cage I want you to think about it now the Lord is the soldier on the battlefield there's nothing wrong and I think it's very good from time to time say search me O Lord try my ways examine my goings right am i busy serving you or am i busy serving myself or something I've formed that has nothing and the devil's got me on some Segway someplace amen because that's a cage God doesn't want us in no cage friends the cage is not our place of residence hallelujah the heavens are our place of residence I mean that's the great thing horrible sight to see that poor Eagle beating his brains out nearly against the cage trying to get free in your helpless just as helpless as you can be and this somebody puts forth his hands and opens the cage and I'll tell you tonight Jesus Christ has done that and calling you that's right open the cage to let you out hallelujah so we can we can be captive and trying to prove that God is leading us yep we don't need to prove anything I have nothing to prove God does the proving right the devil comes all you really think you're the bride you really thinking what we intruder I'll just put you through to the right caller you're you've got the wrong office I'll put you through to my my god my husband you talk to him about it because I'm not here to prove anything he does the proving he doesn't living he's the Christian hallelujah isn't that right so we don't have to be captive to try and prove that God is leading us God does the prove it right we can be kept of trying to prove someone else is either right or wrong but don't build your life around an opinion of somebody build your life around the Lord Jesus Christ his word because at the end of the day what is it to thee this happened this this this this is this today on the news what about it how does this am I going to stand your think am I gonna stand on the day of judgment with all this stuff right no it's gonna be me I'm not gonna stand with all these people did all these things supposedly or or really that's irrelevant to me right it's just asking God now this is in life as the healer I just got a little bit more brother Brown here so so in this quote to see it at liberty them that are bruised it's not just a it's a bruise in your spirit that can't hold us captive right because of wounding where did Jesus get his wounds in the house of his friends this is the house of our friends right the world can do bad things just as we say well Lord Father forgive them they don't know what they do but then when it comes to the realms of believers that's where it cuts the deepest amen so and then and and we can receive a wounding and or a bruise rather in our spirit and then now what happens is just like in a natural and a natural Bruce brother brain speaks about this now no he's talking about cancer coming in but take it to the spiritual because if there's a if there's a wounding in here and the devil can come in and then he can begin to grow now then unnatural things on the earth types of spiritual or cancer would be a scavenger like the buzz that eats dead things cancer usually comes from a Bruce the Bruce first is bruised and you're full of little cells and one of those little cells get smashed in at backslides then the first there's a life not the life that there that was there another life comes in where did he come from think of it it's not complicated where'd he come from the devil and he takes into that the devil cannot create nothing the devil only perverts he can't create he prevents in the first he has to have a way you ask the doctor if your body was perfect and like God made in the beginning it would be impossible to get sick but the God I mean sorry but the devil has to find a weakness somewhere to pervert a weakness we all have a weakness right and the devil's looking for the weakness God knows where your weaknesses right he doesn't make us super people out of weakness were made strong because we are sheep sheep always need a shepherd you can be a just a born lamb or you can be the most mature Ram of the flock or you or whatever it is you still need the shepherd we will never come to a day where we don't need him amen and the more you mature I trust the more you've come to an understanding I need you more more than yesterday right so we always because we all have a weakness we'll have a weak spot in our in our character our nature and the devil's looking for it but by prayer and being surrendered to the Lord that week's book can be covered our God is greater than the I know I'm talking about the devil a lot but I want you understand there's nothing the devil can do against you I mean that can be victorious there's nothing that God cannot conquer because he's already conquered at all oh so now so the first thing there's a life of a siege but the devil has to find a weakness some way to pervert that's the same thing with your sole reason you don't believe in divine healing the devil's found a weak spot in you and he perverted it God is the healer and what offsprings of God's sons and daughters have believing it's like our Father believe notice this little cell it was a Bruce and then a life come into that little Bruce the cell backs slid he says that's a big word for a back for a Baptist to say but it did anyhow and it back slid and the devil put a German there called cancer a tumor whatever it may be and they begin to develop cells and he begins to suck on your blood and what's that he does he eats you up by pulling your blood and what does the doctor - the doctor cuts that out if there's one little speck left it'll live on now divine healing doesn't so much as take away that growth divine healing deals with the devil that's inside of us the germinal life now you know where you come from through a holy wedlock by the will of God which God promised but the German there that's in you it doesn't belong in you your germ your germs our life germs that's a germ of death which would be country to life but how could it be a blessing how could God take the devil to be a blessing to you how could God show his love to you if people say he he does it through strike you down with disease let the devil do it and we know that sickness is an attribute of sin before you have we had any sickness or sin we had no sickness how can a man preach salvation how can you deal with sin in any manner without dealing with sickness you cannot do it we always preach on sin and call it sin just like a big animal had me with us poor in my side pulling my ribs out there is no need of cutting his poor off just hit him in the head it kills the whole body and when Jesus had sin he killed every attribute that sin ever produced so you can't deal without sin without dealing without sickness notice this German start developing cells where did it come from a life in there developing itself going on grow and grow and growing the back of it is a life the life is not God there is only two soft resources of life can come it's either God or from the devil right the and there's only two major spirits God in the devil and God gave you life here on earth and the devil comes and takes it away from you and the cancer is a devil the life and there is the devil and what Jesus said in my name they shall cast out devils what does that take the life out now here's where the this of so-called Christianity fails to receive the healing today they're looking at the lump instead of looking at what God said could you imagine a farmer planting his corn and going out every day digs it up see to see if it will grow or not he'll never have a crop he commits it to the earth under this that God promised and that settles it that's the way we receive every word of God because it's the seed and we receive it in our heart and commit it to God and forget about it God does the rest of it because he promised he would gods would in every word will produce just exactly what it is for the words a seed hallelujah so the devil begins to cover he comes in here he's like a cancer and he grows but the Lord is the great physician hallelujah he's here he's here to heal of us anything that's why the anointing is here the spoon Lord is in this place to sit at liberty them that are bruised recover the sight to the blind bind up the brokenhearted sit at liberty them that are bruised those that are captive those that are bound hallelujah that we don't need we don't need to have the devil in our spirit realm hallelujah but there I trust is that soldier on the battlefield that whenever the enemy comes in like a flood the water God raises a standard Amen comes on your mind it's who you give yourself to that's the one that will have victory hallelujah Amen shall we stay in this morning I mean quit the musicians please I wanna leave with that I trust your mind doesn't look like this today but it looks like a place that's full of green pastures still waters and his life amen hallelujah I'm glad we've escaped the snare of the Fowler the snare is broken and we're free hallelujah we have escaped a male of that

wrong in the sea of God's forgetful [Music] your brother Isaac um so you know we all doing the play and we had a bit of a meeting halfway through and we we kind of need some help to get this play all done it was started officer as a Sunday school play and it now involved into a play that we're doing at Christmastime for people of the public as well they can come in and have a look at the play at the st. that way we usually go to Stokes Valley community center so there's a couple of things when we kind of reassess the whole thing as we we're gonna need a fair level of commitment commitment here to everybody that putting names up and and so this is basically just to to ask you all as a church to really join in now because now not just for a fact that's a sunday-school thing but now we're going out there and we're giving their message to people about our Lord and our Jesus and our Savior that's been born so we kind of have to try the bass we can you know and did God do the race but it's gonna be have to make a big team effort from all of us so this is a couple of things I want to ask because the Sunday School of the youth are going up to the Oakland camp that cuts our practice sessions from five to four so we leave and we lose a whole day in practice session basically just by the youth going up so we wanted to do a Saturday Sunday maybe that weekend but now there's no you so we really can't do it so what sister sheriff has done she has put the final practices on a calendar which we're going to put up and how many did you make copies of that sister cheering so every family has a copy that's got the dedicated times for us to to practice this display and and we just need you to commit to that date so if we have a play it's hard you know I know sometimes you seek and and things happen but just really just try to get you because without the character you can't really know with your position and stuff so we really want to get everybody just committed to the to practice dates if that's alright so that's the that's the biggest thing we ask and then there's a couple of things like we need to have a backdrop for the play so anybody that wants to do the backdrop it we only have month so we can't wait till the last day before we do it to do this backdrop can we get someone maybe if they're willing to do it to paint the backdrop it doesn't have to be something fancy it's just we've got a manger and we've got the field you know because the angel spoke to the wise men so if we can split this thing maybe in two I mean you can speak to sister sheriff and get an idea what you what she's got in a head and then just commit to doing the backdrop but if you said I'm doing it then we we have to get it done and I maybe call upon Isaac and and Andy just if we can get maybe a frame that we can put it up because it's gonna be at the community center just to dot in a frame which it can be in if you guys would maybe help us with that and cuz you've got the skill you've both this wonderful world I think you can that will be easy so if you wanna that's up to you but you if you commit it we put a date on it we're gonna put a date on everything because the winds stay after the youth comes back from the camp will be a food race really so so we're gonna have everybody doing the play are never seen like it's gonna be on that that Saturday so we know we got it all sussed okay so then costumes we're gonna give to the families to do so your children if they ship it we give the moment there's the costume to do and we'll give you a picture of how a ship it looks and we can just all do it if somebody wants to help someone else with it this is the thing we we just call communication say listen I cannot make a halo to save myself we don't have a loosely but I'm just saying then at least say can somebody help me with it I don't know how to cut a hole in a sheet we've got people like sister Robin that would definitely give you some tips on how to do it you know like so we're here to get this thing through the door we've got four practices that means we're gonna only have four hours maybe eight hours of practice before we're gonna we gonna do this play and then the musicians we also asked brother brother either one if he would get the musicians in so we can record the songs that we want to sing in the play and so that we in between the week of the play we can sing the songs and practice them so when it comes to the play we can do the words and we we all sit in the show so that the music it would help we're all ready now to sing it so when we say youth using this song and class using this on they already have the songs and the teachers if you maybe in your Sunday school just just before you start your Sunday school age and just run over your song if you can and then you go into your Sunday School lesson that would be awesome so then at least the kids know where to sing so there's just a bit of organization but we're gonna need a commitment from everyone and and everyone that's here is involved so if you want to get involved even if you don't put your name on the list let's do it we're gonna need your help please so and that's pretty much sister cheer is there anything else you sort of okay and if there's any questions just just ask tutorials to ask me then then we'll just guide you through it but we're gonna need everyone's help but can we just at least get to the practices that's the major one if it's alright and then that's all for me so thank you and we're gonna go into the play right now so just to do the music sister chair if it's gonna you guys going to sort out the music and maybe that the children can eat and do get something to eat and then we can all get here and we'll start just quickly practicing if it's alright with you guys okay god bless you thank you very much [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
