[1:00:52] oh oh back by the spirit have been put
[1:00:54] away we let the holy ghost move yes amen
[1:00:57] every sin is now under the blood
[1:01:00] every sin is now under the blood
[1:01:03] that's why you can't pray enough because
[1:01:05] your sins are popping up they are
[1:01:07] blocking you
[1:01:08] that's why you can make a breakthrough
[1:01:11] oh lord
[1:01:12] that's right hallelujah
[1:01:15] that's why the bible says
[1:01:17] in the days of ely hallelujah
[1:01:20] there was no open vision
[1:01:23] what happens when there is no open
[1:01:24] vision
[1:01:25] they sin
[1:01:27] seeing tabernacles in the church
[1:01:29] but once samuel came back as a prophet
[1:01:31] brother
[1:01:32] all the restoration came back there was
[1:01:34] no sin and we need the spirit of the
[1:01:36] lord back in the church once again we
[1:01:39] want the holy ghost himself to come down
[1:01:42] and raid
[1:01:43] once the holy ghost is here you will
[1:01:46] never come in the house of the lord with
[1:01:48] your
[1:01:50] death today we still have the young
[1:01:53] people that come to church after playing
[1:01:55] dirty in the world then they come they
[1:01:57] come and do whatever they do here and we
[1:01:59] think they're brothers but inside
[1:02:01] they're rotten dead oh lord
[1:02:04] hallelujah we think we've got sisters
[1:02:06] we've got young young young leaders but
[1:02:09] they are all mothers already
[1:02:11] but we don't know about it but they are
[1:02:13] doing it
[1:02:16] that's why though some of us they can't
[1:02:18] receive the holy ghost but they've been
[1:02:20] repenting all their lives they've been
[1:02:22] doing everything right but there's one
[1:02:24] lady there's one boy there's one mother
[1:02:27] there's one father who's not living
[1:02:29] right
[1:02:30] oh jesus but we want the holy ghost to
[1:02:32] move tonight
[1:02:33] we want the power of the holy ghost to
[1:02:35] calm down hide us all of our sins under
[1:02:38] the presence of the lord we need to bask
