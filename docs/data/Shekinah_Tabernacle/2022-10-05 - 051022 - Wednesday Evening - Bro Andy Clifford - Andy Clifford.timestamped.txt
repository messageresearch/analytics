[33:22] worthy oh my that's one of the most
[33:25] powerful statements of whom the world
[33:28] was not worthy
[33:30] they wandered in deserts and in
[33:32] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[33:35] earth and these all glory having
[33:39] obtained a good report through faith
[33:41] who's thankful for Faith tonight that

[34:05] now we're talking about they right and
[34:07] I'm going to carry on reading in verse
[34:09] and from 12 because Paul just carries on
[34:11] they someone separated that but this is
[34:13] the same paragraph wherefore seeing we
[34:17] also Glory are a compassed about was so
[34:19] great a cloud of witnesses oh boy do you
[34:22] realize that there's a great cloud of
[34:24] witnesses these are this is your family
[34:26] behind you they're not somewhere too far
[34:28] off the prophet said they're just above
[34:30] amen they're just around hallelujah amen
[34:34] and they what they did before us the
[34:36] same God is here tonight to do the same

[34:42] hallelujah amen
[34:44] amen amen uh you can have your seats
[34:47] I'll just keep reading because there's
[34:49] quite a lot of reading actually so I'll
[34:51] just carry on so it says here amen and
[34:54] wherefore scene we also are compassed
[34:57] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[34:59] let us lay aside every weight and the
[35:04] sin that does so easily and I just want
[35:07] to underline that easily
[35:11] the Bible says it I don't really like to
[35:13] admit that but it is a thing that can
[35:15] happen very easily and so you must be
[35:19] vigilant amen and keep your eyes on
[35:22] Jesus amen hallelujah keep your eyes on
[35:25] him and stay in fellowship with him
[35:27] because he is the answer to everything
[35:29] he's the answer to our protection he's
[35:32] the answer to our walk he's the answer
[35:34] to success in our spirituality he's the
[35:37] answer to our mental well-being he's the
[35:39] answer to peace within our heart for
[35:41] those whose Minds have stayed on him are
[35:43] kept in
[35:45] perfect peace that's not just any peace
[35:48] now that's the peace that Jesus gives
[35:50] amen hallelujah amen so it says here
[35:53] which does so easily beset us and let us
[35:55] run with patience the race that is set
[35:58] before us and I know I say this every
[36:00] time but I want to say it again that
[36:03] word race is not just something that
[36:04] you're going out there and running even
[36:07] though it's figurative the word race is
[36:09] the battle
[36:10] so there is a battle that is set before
[36:13] every one of you
[36:16] there is an ordained predestined battle
[36:19] full of Trials full of valleys full of
[36:21] mountains full of suffering and full of
[36:24] Glory for you and in that and this is
[36:27] where we're going to get to our text in
[36:29] that suffering in those battles in those
[36:32] victories is The Spoils of War and every
[36:36] time you conquer an enemy and take land
[36:39] you will receive spoils
[36:42] you will receive riches you will receive
[36:45] Treasures you will receive anointings
[36:47] you will receive power you will receive
[36:50] glory and it's already in you
[36:53] it just needs to be taken back from the
[36:55] enemy
[36:57] are you with me
[36:58] Hallelujah and so I want to incite you
[37:01] to war tonight I want to incite you you
[37:04] are
[37:06] a 24 7 devil so don't be a 23 7
[37:09] Christian

[37:35] but what he does and he loves to come he
[37:39] loves to step on the scene and change
[37:41] your situation he loves to come down

[38:29] allow you to go through it don't tamper
[38:31] with it no temple with the evidence
[38:33] don't tamper with it don't try and run
[38:36] off the path or run this way that way
[38:37] just submit to God Amen Let Him lead you
[38:40] let him take the reign of your heart
[38:44] amen
[38:46] second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 10.
[38:49] Hallelujah therefore I take pleasure in
[38:52] infirmities
[38:53] hey man this is Paul speaking again oh
[38:55] sorry I need to just carry on I just
[38:57] skipped about 10 verses out of Hebrews
[39:00] 12. looking unto Jesus the author and
[39:02] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[39:04] that was set before him endured the
[39:07] cross despising the shame and has set
[39:10] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[39:11] God for consider him that endured such
[39:14] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[39:16] lest you be worried and faint in your
[39:18] minds
[39:20] you have not yet resisted unto blood
[39:22] striving against sin and you have
[39:25] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[39:28] unto you as unto children my son
[39:31] and my daughter but son is a double it
[39:34] means both despise not thou the
[39:37] chastening of the Lord nor fate when
[39:39] thou art rebuked of him for whom the
[39:42] Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges
[39:45] every son whom he receiveth every son
[39:48] can you say every son every daughter
[39:52] everyone no one's exempt there is a
[39:55] scorching to take place there's a
[39:57] scouring out to take place there are
[39:59] challenges to take place there is a
[40:01] resurrection to take place but there's
[40:03] also a death there's also a suffering
[40:05] there's also the valleys but in these
[40:07] desert places righteous men are molded
[40:10] into Saints
[40:12] and so these things we must go through
[40:15] Hallelujah but through it all and as you
[40:19] Traverse through these challenges and
[40:21] through these things God will bring you
[40:24] through and you will come out in Victory
[40:26] and you will come out with spoils you'll
[40:30] come out with spoils I mean you'll come
[40:32] out with booty that's what the other
[40:35] word is for spoils which is treasures
[40:37] and those Treasures are not just like
[40:39] physical Golds and things like that but
[40:41] they're actually characteristics it's
[40:43] the characteristics of this divine
[40:44] nature it's your conscience back it's
[40:47] your reasoning back you know sometimes
[40:49] you get into a place where you can't
[40:50] reason properly and people will look on
[40:52] you and they'll think why are you how
[40:54] can you not why are you thinking like
[40:56] that why are you thinking that but the
[40:59] devil stole your reasoning
[41:01] and now it's time for you to take it
[41:02] back if someone's lost their reasoning
[41:05] take it back tonight
[41:07] if someone's lost their conscience
[41:08] because you stared at the wrong thing
[41:10] take it back tonight
[41:12] the Divine healer is here he can heal
[41:15] your hand and he can heal your
[41:16] conscience because your spirit needs
[41:18] healing
[41:19] sometimes in all of us
[41:21] we have these things that happen in our
[41:23] lives for a reason because the Lord
[41:25] wants to come down into your battle and
[41:28] show you just how good he is how
[41:30] powerful he is and how much he can come
[41:32] and heal you amen and heal your family
[41:39] amen
[41:41] for consider oh sorry if you enjoy
[41:44] chastening God deals with you as with
[41:48] sons
[41:49] for what son is he whom the father
[41:51] chasteneth what
[41:53] second Corinthians 12 10 it says
[41:55] therefore I take pleasure and
[41:56] infirmities
[41:57] wow that's a pretty big statement
[42:00] no one really wants to take pleasure in
[42:02] sickness
[42:04] and weakness and reproaches this is Paul
[42:07] now he's saying I'm I'm actually taking
[42:09] pleasure and reproaches and necessities
[42:12] and now that weren't Necessities there
[42:15] is a very interesting uh thought there
[42:17] because you know God brings us to a
[42:20] place where we need Deliverance God
[42:22] brings us to a place where we need him
[42:24] we get into Corners sometimes where
[42:26] there's no other way but God has anyone
[42:28] been there has anyone been in a place
[42:30] where it's the only way out is up
[42:34] oh yeah
[42:36] you know if you haven't been there it's
[42:38] coming
[42:39] Hallelujah you just let God live
[42:41] Hallelujah because God wants to bring
[42:43] you out of those situations he wants to
[42:46] bring you out of those things where the
[42:48] devil's stolen something from you he
[42:49] wants to bring you out of a situation
[42:51] where you cannot do it Hallelujah
[42:53] because he wants to bring that treasure
[42:55] into your life because you see that's a
[42:58] devil squatting on your land oh man when
[43:00] you know that there's a devil squatting
[43:02] on your inheritance he's got an expiry
[43:04] date he's got his comings amen who
[43:08] believes that Hallelujah
[43:10] amen and until you take that portion of
[43:13] your inheritance you can't till the soil
[43:16] you can't use it there cannot be fruit
[43:18] on that part of your life but when you
[43:21] take it this is The Spoils of War
[43:23] tonight when you take that part of your
[43:25] land it becomes yours forever because
[43:28] you will never let the devil take that
[43:29] back hello because you will take that
[43:32] and defend that and walk in there and
[43:34] wage war amen hallelujah God acting on
[43:39] your behalf
[43:40] Glory
[43:42] Hallelujah I take pleasure in reproaches
[43:46] and necessities
[43:48] Hallelujah and persecution you know this
[43:51] necessities
[43:52] I just want to stop on that a little bit
[43:54] how long have we got
[43:55] my halfway so necessities
[44:00] you see the devil is very good at
[44:02] meeting all of our needs
[44:04] if you don't I I you probably already
[44:07] know this but he has a very big
[44:10] free of knowledge and as bows his
[44:13] branches just extend the Earth the Bible
[44:15] describes him as a giant tree and all
[44:17] the kings and everyone just is eating
[44:19] his fruit and just relishing under him
[44:22] the whole economy everything of this
[44:24] world is just it's just relishing under
[44:27] this great tree of knowledge and we
[44:29] happen to have a big portion of that in
[44:31] our own lives when we participate in the
[44:34] monetary system and go to jobs and go to
[44:36] work and we participate in planting our
[44:39] potatoes and you know we go home and you
[44:41] turn the key of your car all of those
[44:43] things is meeting a need that you have
[44:46] and these little soft things in your
[44:48] pillow and your blankets and your
[44:50] electric blanket amen and all those
[44:52] things that you have those Comforts
[44:54] those Creature Comforts they're just
[44:55] meeting your needs they're comforting
[44:57] you and many times they're lullabying
[45:00] you to sleep
[45:01] but it's time to wake him yeah it's time
[45:04] my little bride's awaken from sleep and
[45:08] waking up and realize that these things
[45:10] is just a decoration but just beyond
[45:12] that Hallelujah is the truth of the
[45:15] matter and so as the prophet says that
[45:18] and there will come a time where the
[45:19] discernment and the bride will discern
[45:21] the Antichrist Spirit it will discern it
[45:23] all and he will become powerless against
[45:25] you and all of this veneer and all the
[45:28] things of this world all the Comforts
[45:30] and all those things will lose their
[45:31] attraction in your life and you will
[45:34] begin to break through and you will
[45:36] begin to walk with God Amen among and
[45:39] above it all amen amen hallelujah
[45:43] amen
[45:45] therefore I take pleasure and
[45:47] necessities and persecutions in
[45:49] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[45:51] am weak then am I strong
[45:54] hallelujah amen
[45:57] the prophet says this and um the church
[45:59] ages he says the cloudy skies and storms
[46:02] of life are no signs of God's
[46:03] disapproval
[46:05] neither are bright skies and still water
[46:07] signs of his love and approval
[46:09] his approval of any of us is only in the
[46:13] Beloved his love is effective which he
[46:17] had for us before the foundation of the
[46:19] world
[46:19] does he love us ah yes but how do shall
[46:23] we know we shall know because he said so
[46:26] and manifested that as he did love us
[46:30] for he brought us to himself and gave us
[46:32] of his Spirit placing us as Sons amen
[46:35] who's been placed tonight who's had God
[46:37] work in their life tonight who's seen
[46:40] his hand in their life has he begun
[46:43] something in you amen if he's begun
[46:45] something in you he will carry it
[46:47] through amen Philippians 1 6 being
[46:50] confident of this very thing that he
[46:52] which begun a good work in you shall
[46:54] continue it unto the day of Jesus Christ
[46:56] hallelujah amen so he's brought you out
[46:59] of Egypt out of Darkness into himself
[47:01] Amen to give you life and to give you
[47:03] light and to change your nature to make
[47:06] you ready for the Rapture amen
[47:09] Hallelujah and this is here
[47:12] and gave us a spirit placing us as sons
[47:14] and how shall I prove my love to him
[47:17] that's a good question and the prophet
[47:19] says by believing what he said amen amen
[47:21] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[47:25] the trials that he and his wisdom allows
[47:27] to come to pass
[47:30] I love that
[47:33] Hallelujah
[47:36] Hallelujah
[47:38] may the Lord help me
[47:43] I need a two I need an intercooler up
[47:45] here you know it's so hot
[47:48] you see no matter how hard it gets
[47:52] how tough it gets how you know the the
[47:55] Lord will not put you through something
[47:56] that you cannot handle amen he will not
[47:59] take you take you above something that
[48:01] will crush you down until you're nothing
[48:03] he will always allow these things to
[48:06] happen and the devil is on a leash
[48:08] tonight amen the devil has got an ex
[48:10] he's got only a little he can only go
[48:12] this far and no further and so the
[48:14] things that you are going through is
[48:16] controlled but just remember this
[48:18] Hallelujah when you begin to engage with
[48:21] God and when God begins to work in your
[48:23] life amen when he begins to engage with
[48:25] you and and you get serious with God who
[48:28] serious was God tonight amen if you're
[48:31] serious with God God wants to get into
[48:33] the very center of your life he wants to
[48:35] come down into every door of your heart
[48:37] he wants to come down into the deepest
[48:39] parts of your life so that he can change
[48:41] those sins so I just encourage you just
[48:43] open it all up amen he wants to build
[48:45] your house he wants to build the divine
[48:48] nature in you as we heard on Sunday he
[48:50] wants to build that your spirit egg he
[48:52] wants you to have a good conscience he
[48:54] wants you to have clean affections he
[48:56] wants you to have good imaginations he
[48:59] wants you to remember him in your memory
[49:01] amen hallelujah he wants you to have
[49:04] clear reasonings and be able to think
[49:06] properly so it's time as he starts
[49:08] building your house and I want to just
[49:09] visit because you the the story of Ezra
[49:12] you know when they they that Cyrus you
[49:15] know the the king of uh the medes and
[49:18] Persians at the time it starts off with
[49:20] him getting a dream and the Lord visits
[49:22] him and says I want my house built
[49:25] Hallelujah they'd been in Babylon they
[49:28] and so they had been struggling under
[49:30] the the regime of Babylon and then
[49:32] Persian Empire but then the Lord says I
[49:35] want my house built and so he gives
[49:37] Cyrus this burden and he and he and
[49:40] Cyrus brought forth a decree that and he
[49:43] says go and build the house and whatever
[49:45] you need and he gives us out everything
[49:48] that Nebuchadnezzar took out of the
[49:49] temple to restore The Spoils of War to
[49:53] restore everything back that the devil
[49:55] had taken and so he was saying I want my
[49:57] house built again and so a people came
[49:59] together under the decree of the king to
[50:02] rebuild the house you see though
[50:05] whenever you try to do something for God
[50:07] the devil is right there to try and stop
[50:09] it but I want to encourage you never
[50:11] give up never stop fighting never stop
[50:15] building just continue on no matter how
[50:18] hard it gets no matter how hopeless it
[50:20] seems no matter how much you fail just
[50:22] take a sword in one hand and take the
[50:24] Bible in the other hand and take your
[50:26] tools and continue on continue building
[50:28] continue fighting continue pressing
[50:31] forward no matter what Hallelujah the
[50:34] devil came against us around the people
[50:36] he got those people together and he
[50:38] started rallying in the political realm
[50:40] started rallying against them started
[50:42] putting letters to the king and he
[50:44] swatted them and they got discouraged
[50:46] and it stopped for a little while and
[50:49] sometimes you find yourself in a
[50:51] situation where you're so beaten down
[50:54] and you have and you feel and you
[50:55] realize that that thing that God did in
[50:57] my life that Glory that Revival that I
[51:00] had those that first love that I had
[51:03] that's gone
[51:04] where's it gone let's just stop for a
[51:06] little while maybe you got this courage
[51:07] maybe the enemy came in he saw that you
[51:09] were building he saw that God was doing
[51:11] something in your life and then he began
[51:13] to attack you and he begins to go before
[51:15] our King and say let me tempt them and
[51:18] God saw confidence in his salvation in
[51:22] you to allow you to go through something
[51:24] where you would end up in a valley and
[51:26] it's all stop seemingly
[51:28] but remember there's a purpose God wants
[51:32] to get victory over that enemy in your
[51:34] life God wants you to receive Spoils of
[51:36] all God wants you to gain land he wants
[51:39] to build your house and so you see then
[51:42] they said no you know what we're going
[51:43] to rise up and they win and they
[51:45] petition and then the king Darius he
[51:48] begin and he went and searched the the
[51:51] books and searched the records and he
[51:53] and he found that it had been decreed
[51:56] and so what he did and I want to tell
[51:58] you that when you don't give up then
[52:01] when you just have a a true faith in you
[52:03] and you never just let it go even if you
[52:07] find that you've been ground down to a
[52:09] stump has anyone ever been ground down
[52:11] to a stump where you just feel like it's
[52:13] all been round off and you're just
[52:15] completely broken but then God begins to
[52:19] come on the scene and he begins to issue
[52:21] and eat it from Darius he begins to
[52:24] issue and say you know what those
[52:26] enemies they wrote those letters I'm
[52:28] gonna make them help you Hallelujah I'm
[52:32] gonna make those enemies you know what
[52:33] they did King Darius he actually got the
[52:36] ones that were talking and complaining
[52:37] and making it hard for them and he made
[52:39] them pay
[52:40] to build the temple

[52:47] tributes that will normally come to me I
[52:49] want you guys to pay Jerusalem I want

[52:56] the temple I want you guys to supply all
[52:58] the wood yeah
[52:59] so that they can build
[53:06] I never give up
[53:08] no matter how hard it seems no matter
[53:10] how far you may have gone no matter how
[53:13] trouble it might fight just remember God
[53:16] has not giving up on you God is behind
[53:20] you he's beneath you he's within you and
[53:21] he's gonna rise up from him and then you
[53:23] just fight amen

[53:58] Revelation vulcanized by fire you know
[54:01] what you can have all those things mixed
[54:03] together in your mind and it's a good
[54:05] Doctrine and then the fire comes and
[54:06] melts it all together oh tonight Saints

[56:18] tragic things that happen just remember
[56:21] the race is set before you amen it's
[56:24] ordained
[56:25] God wants to put Treasures in you he
[56:28] wants to take the treasures out of the
[56:30] soil of your heart
[56:31] because you see it's all in the in a
[56:34] potential but until you go through
[56:36] something until you have a necessity in
[56:38] your life until there's a trial so deep
[56:40] Hallelujah that's so close to your heart
[56:43] that you there's just no other way out
[56:45] what's going to happen and when
[56:47] someone's hating on you and you for no
[56:50] reason and you love them and they hate
[56:52] on you and they can't you can't break
[56:54] through but then God comes what is it

[57:24] you get away with son and the wayward
[57:27] son like the prodigal father and the
[57:29] trials were so deep upon him but that
[57:32] prodigal father when he got his son back
