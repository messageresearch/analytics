TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I was there when the spirit came. Felt his power and I praise his name. I was there when the spirit came. Felt the fire falling from above. Oh, the wondous goodness of his love. I was there when the spirit came. Oh, holy father, just let thy goodness rain. Feed me, Lord Jesus, in the spirit once again. If he never found his purpose, then you better go and repent again. I was there when the spirit came. Like the blessed day at Pentecost. Disciples in the spirit were lost. They were there when the spirit came. [Applause] Like a mighty rushing roar of wind. Souls are saved. Christ the same as this. I was there when the spirit came. Oh holy father, just let thy goodness rain. Feed me Lord Jesus in the spirit once again. If you knew if purpose, then you better go repentance again. I was there when the spirit came. Just like the day on Pentecost, the disciples and the spirit were lost. They were there when spirit came like a mighty washing. blow of wind chose the savior Christ the same as him. I was there when the spirit came. Oh holy father just let thy goodness rain. Feed me Lord Jesus in the spirit once again. If you never had his purpose, then you better go and repent again. I was there when the spirit came. Oh, holy father, just let thy goodness rain. Be me, Lord Jesus, in the spirit once again. If you never had his purpose in, you better go run my pants again. I was there when the spirit came. Oh, holy father, just let thy goodness rain.
