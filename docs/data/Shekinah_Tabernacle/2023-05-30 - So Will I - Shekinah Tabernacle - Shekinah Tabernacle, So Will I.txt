========================================

[Music] The God of creation [Music] there at the stop before the beginning of time [Music] with no point of reference. You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of life. And as you speak, 100 billion galaxies are born. In the vapor of your breath, the planets form. If the stars were made to worship, so will I. I can see your heart in everything you've made. [Music] Every burning star, a signal fire of grace. If creation sings your praises, so will I. You're a God of your promise. You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void. [Music] For once you have spoken. [Music] Oh nature in science follow the sound of your voice. [Music] And as you speak a 100 billion creatures catch your breath. [Music] evolving in pursuit of what you said. [Music] If it all reveals your nature, so will I. I can see your heart and everything you say. [Music] Every painted sky, a canvas of your grace. If creation still obeys you, so will I. If creation still obeys you, so will I. If the stars were made to worship, so will I. If the mountains bow and river and so will I. If the oions roar your greatness, so will I. For if everything exists to lift you high, so will I. If the wind goes where you send it, so will I. If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I. If the sum of all our praises still fall shine, then we'll sing again a 100 billion times. Oh, so alive. [Music] You're the God of salvation. [Music] You chase down my heart through all of my failure and pride on a hill. You created the light of the world abandoned in darkness to die. [Music] And as you speak, a 100 billion failures disappear. [Music] We lost your life so I could find it here. [Music] If you left the grave behind you, so will I. If you left the grave behind you, so will I. I can see your heart and everything you've done. Every part designed in a work of our core love. If you gladly chose surrender so alive. If you gladly chose surrender so alive. I can see your heart billion different ways. Every precious one. A child you came to save. If you gave your life to love them so I like you would again a h 100 billion times or what measure could amount to your desire. [Music] You're the one who never leaves the one behind. You're the one who never leaves the one behind. [Applause] Hallelujah.
