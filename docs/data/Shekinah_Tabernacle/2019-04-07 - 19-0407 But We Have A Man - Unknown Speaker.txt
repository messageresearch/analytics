God bless you thank you musicians thank you brother Jeremy um brother Aran just turned me down a little bit thank you amen God bless you all great to have everyone here amen God bless your sister welcome good to have you here too God bless you trust you feel at home amen let's turn to the Book of Job um I got a slideshow if it's there amen I trust everyone's well hallelujah amen can I drive this I can cool okay let's go to Job chapter N9 I'm just going to read um four I think four verses from job 9 and then we're going to go to Revelations 5 so it says here in job 9 from verse 28 job is speaking he says I'm afraid of all my sorrows I know that thou will not hold me innocent if I be Wicked why then I why then labor I in vain if I wash myself with snow water and make my hands Never So Clean yet uh Thou shalt plunge me in the ditch and my own clothes shall upour me for he is not a man this is speaking now of he speaking of the Lord for he is not a man as I am that I should answer him and we should come together in judgment neither is there any daysan betwix us that may lay that might lay his hand upon us both let him take his Rod away from me let not his fear terrify me then would I speak and not fear him but it is not so with me now as we're turning to Revelations chapter 5 when he says a d uh betwix us a a daysan is a it's a it's a very old English word but it means a a umpire or an arbitus or someone who can bridge the gap between God and him he's looking there's there's no man but we have a man amen hallelujah let's go to Revelations chapter 5 I'm going to come back to all this but I want to come to here we are just go to Revelations 5 And1 amen just as a bit of a a bit of a context here we're going to read um some of the scripture Revelations 5 And1 so it says here um and I saw just go here and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the Throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice saying who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven neither in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld in low in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the 4 and20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and Nation now let's just drop down to verse 13 and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such is in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying now John not weeping no more there's a change saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four Beast said amen and the 4 and20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever amen may the Lord bless his word this morning you you may have your seats I want to speak on a subject if I could take one where we heard brother cin uh speaking on Wednesday and he made a statement which which um triggered this whole thought he said speaking of Daniel and the Lion's Den he said you know Daniel normally people are men are thrown into Lion's dens and normally that's the end conclusion you know the person gets eaten but he says these words but we have a man amen amen and now we have a man this morning we're more than a prophet more than a priest amen more than a king but we have a man the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so I want to you know job was saying here he said if he only had someone a daan betwix US between him and God if he only had a man that could Bridge the gulf then he says then would I speak and not fear Him amen so there has to come a you know we're living in the hour of the third pole we're living in the manifestation of the third pole and the power of the third pole we know the third pole is the opening of the word it's the revealing of Christ but there's a spoken word power that's being placed into the bride amen that is now coming into manifestation brother Bram says what you've seen manifested temporarily you see when that squeeze comes on it will be manifested in the fullness of its power and we know that the squeeze has come right we are living in a squeeze hour so if that is the case then the what you've seen manifested temporarily in the prophet's Ministry of the power of the spoken word will be manifested in the fullness of its power Amen in the bride of Christ so we have to come to a place where we are not afraid to speak am mean we are not afraid afid you know to you know you know to to you know we're not afraid to speak what the word says I mean we're not afraid to take our god-given rights amen but we have full confidence and full Assurance by the blood of Jesus Christ that we have a god-given right Amen to take God at his word amen and speak the word in faith Hallelujah because now as I said last Sunday the atmosphere we're going to have the atmosphere right amen and our words that we speak create an atmosphere yes amen amen I'll just take it very extreme you get up in the morning you look at your children and you begin to tell them they're useless you'll create an atmosphere and what does that create in your kids you they'll be upset they'll be broken they'll be hurt because the words that you're speaking brings an atmosphere it brings a spirit upon them and they'll begin to manifest well I'm useless Daddy doesn't love me he doesn't think I'm important what's happening in atmosphere is created by the words that are spoken amen so if that's on the negative how much more the positive amen where you know we have the story of you know brother baram you know he's in the woods and he's and he's pondering on about Mark 11 and we'll come to it maybe later in the service and he's wondering about how when when when Jesus says but if ye say to this mountain and do not doubt but believe what you know it shall and you say be thou removed and cast in the sea it shall be done and he's wondering what does this mean and so he's looking he's pondering Lord how does this work and then God just comes down says I'm going to show you that's right what do you have need of right you say well he didn't really need squirrels he wasn't starving but that triggered I mean faith and had he right to say the right thing at the right time and her two boys receive salvation because she believed am in the testimony of the Prophet right so Faith amen creates an atmosphere and that atmosphere amen is created that God can come down and do the supernatural am mean because we're more than just we don't just Christianity is a it's a manifestation of God hallelujah and we want to have the right atmosphere around us of faith I mean that God can come down and do the supernatural Hallelujah so that's where I want to go to we shouldn't be afraid to speak we shouldn't be afraid to say yes Lord I take you your word amen because remember we are not a downtrodden people we have a man that's bridged the gulf for you amen we have a man that is that has bridged the way has cleansed us of all sin am me his blood is washed us the bride is clean the bride is pure amen and I believe I'm looking at part of that bride this morning amen we're not saying will we make it we know we're going to make it amen we're not wondering are we're going to take a rapture we know Hallelujah because the Apostle Paul says that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things unseen now in the scripture the word hope is not like we would say hope is like when you say for example well I hope it's going to be sunny on the weekend you're just hoping it's a stab in the dark but Bible hope is an expectation with pleasure if you look at the definition It's actually an expectation with pleasure so faith is the substance of things expected the evidence of things unseen that's real faith I mean real faith is that actually puts you under expectation am mean that what God has promised you will come to pass Hallelujah so now that's why there's something in The Believer that's moved Hallelujah it says faith God the faith of God has come into us and now we're under expectation for a body change we're under expectation for a Rapture we're under expectation that God will bring our wayward ones home amen we'll save our families Hallelujah we'll heal our sick we'll raise the dead amen because faith has given us an expectation that it will happen Hallelujah that's why we're not W worried or wondering amen we should have an expectation Lord your word has promised it You' have provided the ability for it to happen you've given me the faith to believe it it's not my own human Faith No More the Apostle Paul PA said the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God see he's saying that the life I now live is not my faith it's the faith of the Son of God that's now in me that's now living Hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I amen the life we now live what me and my little life yes the life you now live amen you're now living by the faith of the Son of God it's not your own Faith No More it's God's faith hallelujah hallelujah and if you have the faith of God God believed his own word when he said let there be sun MO moon and stars he had to believe what he said and it came to pass Hallelujah so now you you have that same faith in you amen so I just say let Faith have her work let her have her free reign take control faith amen I don't know what needs to be done but Lord You Take Control not my doubts not the devil's doubts I mean the devil you know the devil always tries to get you to live by his experience that's why he pours doubt into you cuz he doesn't really believe amen the the Bible says that the Devils believe and tremble but they don't believe like you believe they've just got a mental Faith like Judas didn't have a real Faith but the other Apostles did so the devil now to say well this is my experience I've got to give it to you and that's why he gives you doubt and questions and trouble and that's just the devil trying to pour that into you I just say no devil that's not my experience I got saved he touched me and made me whole I Am Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb saved from sin and I know I am not because some told me God told me hallelujah amen so we should not be in fear amen amen love should drive our walk Divine love why are you a Christian Divine love amen why do you serve him Divine love why do you live the way you live Divine love Hallelujah not because of fear I'm not afraid of God Amen I love him one time I did fear him because I was an alien from him I was actually his enemy the scripture said but then he came down amen and redeem me but I'm no longer his enemy Hallelujah I'm his bride Jes Hallelujah so we shouldn't Hallelujah friends we should just Rejoice yeah well the devil's on my case I'm going through trials Hallelujah just be happy amen the Apostle Paul said yo just be content for this is the will of God concerning you wherever you are right now you say well I'm in a I'm in a dire situation that's the will of God concerning you right now I'm on the hilltop that's the will of God concerning you right now just Rejoice that's all working for your good anyway it's all working for you working for your good you mean this trial's working for my benefit absolutely Hallelujah now brother brah says and speak to the Rock N uh speak to the Rock and it shall bring forth as water 1960 he says God how we thank you we can speak to you we're so thankful to be on speaking terms the blood of Jesus Christ puts us in this condition amen hallelujah aren't you glad you can talk to your maker I mean you can talk to your bridegroom your husband Hallelujah there's no golf Hallelujah no more Amen brother Braham says this in the mighty conqueror I just love this he says great victories have been won many of us today can remember well of the first World War I remember when I was just a little boy I can hear the whistles blowing and even the farmers in the field sto their horses wave their hats they scream they hollered what had happen happened the war was over victory was won the great economy that we were fighting for finally they won the victory I'm thinking of this last World War I live just across the street and when the whistles begin to blow people run into the yards woman with their aprons on taking them off swinging them in the air bullets flying through the trees whistles blowed cars raced through the streets people fell on their knees raised up their hands they screamed they cried why because the war was over and the Blessed ones the dear boys that was across the sea would be soon be sailing home again to them what if Victory what a time what a thrill to any heart what a jubilee that night everybody was in such a humor you could have walked into a restaurant eat walked down and not paid for it it would have been all right you could have used the next man's car it would have been all right you could have asked uh what you wanted to and probably would have got it because why the victory was one the boys was coming home it was all over and I'm thinking my brother it's too bad that those kind of feelings can't stay all the time but to the Christian this morning the victory is won Joy Bells Are Ringing the war is over between God and man the victory's been won before any Victory can be won there's got to be great prices paid oh what prices sometimes they're very deep amen they make great scars tearing down but in order to have the mountain you've got to have the valley before you have the sunshine you've got to get the rain before You' get the have the light you've got to have the night before we have right we have to be uh they have to have wrong or you never would have known what wrong was but in order to conqu and to win the greatest battle that was ever won one stepped out of Glory many years ago he did not take upon himself the form of an Angel he did not come as some great person but he was going to prove that didn't take muskets and bullets and atomic bombs to win a war he closed himself in humility like a little baby and was born in a manger there was not even a place for his birth when he come I want you to look at the different material of warfare that he used now Adam's race was all in bondage they were without hope without God without chance without Mercy without anything that could help him we were in this condition am mean the great enemies of the lower regions of the Lost had been shut up in darkness there was not a way out there was no one could help nothing could be done it looked like a total complete loss but our hero Hallelujah who came down from the portal portals of Glory condescending down listen my hero isn't the one who who who wins the World Cup soccer rugby that's not my hero my hero doesn't win the America's Cup my hero doesn't win the Olympics whatever thing my hero Hallelujah can step down into a meeting like this speak to someone who just slpt on a Pew amen bring them to eternal life my hero raises the dead me my hero casts Out the Devil hallah my hero goes peace and passes all understanding I mean my hero redeems my hero resurrects the dead Hallelujah that's my hero I mean my hero went to a grave one day A man was 4 days dead he said Lazarus

heals he saves that's my hero I trust he's your hero this morning Hallelujah and he is not hasn't changed one iota he may not be in his Corporal body amen but his spirit is still upon the Earth his word is still here to do what he promised it would do Hallelujah my is present my hero is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he's my hero today Hallelujah trust he yours amen but our hero who came down from the portals of Glory condescending down for there was no man on earth that could do the job they are all as worldly speaking in the same boat we all were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies you can turn that down a B brother Aman and none of us could help each other we stood helpless defeated Chaos on every hand all ununited we could not keep the laws and ceremonies finding their weaknesses and so forth we could not we could not do it and it seemed like the whole human race was laid waste hallelujah what a state we were once in that state friends Hallelujah we were born in that state doesn't matter how good the family you were born into doesn't matter how moral whatever it was amen we were all born in this way Hallelujah but then he came Hall but we have a man Hallelujah he came because he was in the beginning the Bible said he was the word he was the logos that went out of God and the logos in the beginning was the word he became the word and when he ascended up on that glorious day of Easter he became not only the word but he became the high priest of his own word oh what a glorious thing he says brother Neville just think he's not only the word but he's the high priest of his own word how could we doubt it how could we walk to him and not believe that we receive what we ask for remember he is the high priest of our profession which is our confession so you want God to work on your behalf you start confessing his word I mean you start taking him at his word and you start quoting his word back to him I mean then God the great high priest will act on your behalf amen but if you confess doubt and and and and be critical of one another and speak negative things he can't work with that you got to give God something to work with Hallelujah and the best thing for him to work with is his word Hallelujah don't you want to see his word be performed in your life I would start quoting his word start quoting what he says about you don't quote what the devil says about you quote what God has said about you that's the only thing worth quoting is what God has said about you if he says I'm sinless I am if he says I'm being redeemed I am if he says I've been washed by the blood then I am Hallelujah if he says I'm as righteous as he is righteous then I am Hallelujah I'd start quoting his word if he this is a more than a conqueror I am then I am I am Hallelujah glory to God that's what I would start quoting amen do you good well I don't feel like it just start quoting it just start quoting it Hallelujah you know there's that song um oh it's just escaped me oh take the name of Jesus with you child of sorrow and of Woe it will joy and come forgive you take it wherever you go I've had times in my life down in the dumps I start singing that I stay in the dumps Hallelujah Joy begins to come rejoicing starts happening why because take the name of Jesus with you amen hallelujah yes that's right you know negative thoughts are not Eternal thoughts amen they're going to come to an end so why think about them what's it going to do you it doesn't going to help you all much amen is I think I've asked before has worry ever helped anyone well then why worry has stress helped anyone then why stress amen you know if it hasn't helped anyone before it won't help anyone now has Faith helped anyone I don't have enough time to start there but has Faith helped anyone will it help you today will it continue to help you has has taking God his word helped anyone Hallelujah will they continue to help people today it just take him at his word amen hallelujah for he is the word and the intercessor of the word the logos became word the word made flesh and the same flesh that was his word received up into glory and now is the high priest making intercession by himself to his word that's what it takes that's the material that that the church has got what a weapon there's never been one like it he was the word and when he come he was born in a manger he came to use the weapon of Lov love to conquer the world not with army bullets not with machine guns pardon me uh and tanks but he come in a different manner he came in the form of love he was God's love one time as a little boy I used to think that Christ loved me and God hated me because Christ died for me but God had something against me but I come to find out that Christ is the very Heart Of God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth on him should not perish but should have eternal life now he come first to conquer and the thing that the devil had put in the world was hatred and he come to conquer hatred when we win our battles and so forth in the world's battles it always leaves continually a hat hatred because battles of that sort is of the enemy but Christ come with love to conquer hatred to love those who are unlovable he's talking about me amen he came with a different weapon he humbled himself made a little L than the angels to suffer death and to give an example and when he was here on Earth he walked among men Hallelujah glory to God he says in an absolute he says God is watching over his word to vindicate it he's got to make it real he's got to make it act so God is watching ing over his word to make it live to make it act that's what he's doing that's what he's wanting to do in our lives he's watching over his word that atmosphere of faith will be produced amen that we'll begin to speak it amen that God will come down and perform it Hallelujah he says he says um that's the way God has brought his church from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word the ministry in the church will be just exactly like his that's why God is here to Quicken his word friends I just say Here I Am Lord Make It live in me Hallelujah just like this when my shadow hear of my hand if I never seen my hand seen the shadow but it gets pale and it gets away and a little and it gets a little closer and closer the negative and positive are coming together until they're both the same thing and that's exactly when the church and the word has to be one like Jesus and God was one just exactly God has was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and so will the will Christ have to be in the church the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled and that's the Capstone that's to come upon the last day church not the lady OA now it's a calling out of that a bride out of a church uh uh in other words it's like he called a nation out of a nation in Egypt and now we're living in that day and we're grateful for these things that we have been seeing this is when God keeps his appointments in 1964 so he says that the bride and and Christ will become one amen hallelujah l this is the day we're living now where are we can we go back here now he says here in Mark 7 we're just going to go through this very quickly cuz it's really amazing if you read through the gospels the order of the of the stories and God had it written in that way and when he had called unto all the people he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him are those that defile the man if any man have to hear Let Him hear and when he was entering into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable and he saith unto them are you so without understanding also do you not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defile him because it entereth not into his heart but into his belly and it goth out into the draw purging all Meats now before this the Pharisees were criticizing saying why do the disciples wash with clean I mean eat with unclean hands so this is what that and this is so Jesus saying it's not the physical things that can defile it's what's in the heart that defiles and he said and he said that from that which cometh out of the man that defiled the man for uh for from within out of the heart of men proceedes evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit malicious uh maliciousness an evil eye blasphemy Pride full of fness all these evil things come from within and they defile the man that's an unconverted heart right there and then now but notice it goes straight into the story of the serap phenician woman now he's saying those things that come out of a man's heart defile I me but if the right things if the heart has been changed then when then the right things will come out as the Bible says you can't get sweet and bitter water out of the same well it's either sweet or it's bitter just like a tree you don't get grapes and and thorns out of the same tree right out of the same Vine you either it's either a thorn tree with thorns or a grape vine amen by their fruits you shall know them right so now here it is that so now here is this woman now he says for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit now I know I went through this last Sunday but I want to emphasize something very important heard of them and came and fell at his feet the woman was a Greek a serap phenician by nation and he besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children be first filled for it's not me to take children's bread and cast it unto the dogs and she answered and said unto him yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil has gone out of thy daughter and when she had come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed so he says for this saying because you answered me in this way because you're approach was humble you're willing to take anything you could get I mean just a crumb was enough not the whole life just a crumb but she was willing just to take that little bit she was willing to take anything she could get amen that her daughter would be made well and then so he says for this saying go find her healed Hallelujah so that's why I'm emphasizing this it's very important what we say it's very important how we respond to the word am mean if we respond in a critical fashion you receive what the Pharisees rece amen damnation but if you come in able way saying yes Lord this is youen you receive God's reward which is eternal life Hallelujah so now you got to say now for this saying that's why when had WR brother Brown telling the testimony the squirrels and something just moved our heart saying that's nothing but the truth hallelujah then God came down for this saying and then God and then you know youo brother Ram said well God told Brother Ram ask her what you will and then and then the anointing is there and then and then and then the prophet saying ask what you will and and you'll have it you have a million dollars it'll fall on your lap the healing of your parents or sister or whatever and then now she's had he writes what should I ask for because God is waiting for a response but but then now she comes out the the most de thing upon her soul as the salvation of her boys and her boys were laughing making fun they weren't sitting there all Reverend believing what was going on they're just boys McKing around but because she said the right thing she says I want the salvation of my boys and he said you'll receive in the name of Jesus Christ and they receive their salvation because for this saying you shall receive it Hallelujah and that wasn't just done that we can say what a nice testimony God is trying to tell you amen the same Faith amen and what is happening in this hour will produce the same thing Hallelujah have you ever that's why you know that's why when you're fellowship with Believers you begin to talk about the Lord what happens the atmosphere begins to change God begins to come down what are my children talking about Hallelujah I want to have fellowship with them he enjoys being praised he enjoys being talked about Hallelujah he enjoys when we lift him up saying isn't he wonderful isn't he glorious he redeem me he saved me he's done this for me hallah then God comes down Hallelujah that's why we want to try live in that kind of atmosphere and it's up to you to generate that atmosphere we are atmosphere generators amen so it's up to you what kind of atmosphere do you want to live under do you want to live under an atmosphere of tension and stress and strife and unbelief or do you want to live in an atmosphere of divine love amen whether it's just such an atmosphere around you Hallelujah I think we haven't even probed into the reality of God like we should amen I was so I was just at work and I was just pondering a few things then my mind went went to when brother baram he goes to the hospital where his first wife hope is dying and and and he says that he shakes her brings her back youo and then she comes to herself and then hope looks up at her him and says why did you why did you bring me back and she says she says Bill you've preached about it you've talked about it but you know so a little about it and he says what do you mean he says I was being lifted she said I was being being sced by two Heavenly beings men a woman and white and there all these big birds of paradise flying around there was just all was all peace and joy and but he's telling the prophet you know you talked about it you preached about it but you know so little about the reality of it how great it is oh hallelujah how great it is you think we have you know God comes you know and it's all over the world God comes down to a meeting and we never want to leave that's just a shadow of a shadow of the reality of what heaven will really be like how great it really will be I mean just that when that sweet humble feeling comes over you think oh my can I just be here forever and God's really just saying that's just a trickle that's not it's going to be far greater over there than we can imagine Hallelujah that's right amen I think my Lord Jesus you know and I think we're still in that same predicament we talk about it we preach about it God comes down but we know so little about how great it really is hallelujah amen that's why I think we should talk about it Lord give us a foretaste there more than just words but you come down you come down anoint our fellowship anoint when we even just talk to you Lord there's such an atmosphere that's like when when brother Isaac was here preaching on um was it Divine love or what was your title unconditional love I wasn't here but eyes up and field I come back an is sitting there in her seat at the end of the service and and and Christine comes back after playing the piano and Le is's just in tear so happy and she says mom Jesus touched me Hallelujah I don't want to leave hallelujah what is that God can move on the young he can move on the old he can move on the every age Hallelujah but what was that that wasn't just that was God coming in behind what brother Isaac was preaching saying yes this is true Hallelujah and there was a heart that was open to respond and she said I don't want to leave this presence Hallelujah and that's just a foraste of how glorious it will be over there hallelujah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so for this saying go thy way Hallelujah the devil has gone out of thy daughter that's why we should always speak good things you know there's a saying if you got nothing good to say say nothing at all I think that holds very true am we should say good things amen H we say good things of one another we should run each other down what if the person that you're running down is actually the one that God wants us used to help the person that you're talking to amen think about it now he says here in 2 Corinthians 4 we having the same Spirit of Faith according as written I have believed I believe therefore I have spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with you so he's saying I believe therefore I have spoken you believe amen we also believe and therefore speak so if we believe we can't hold silent amen we can't hold silent I mean if God has has has birthed us into the kingdom who's been birthed who's something and something God's turned your heart said Lord I believe your word that's God doing that that's God turning your heart that's not you there's nothing in man that really wants God Amen it says in Romans not one6 after him and our caral natural way we're not built to follow God but God put a jean seed in your soul Hallelujah and in God season he Broods over that seed brings it to life and that's why there's something in US Lord I want to follow you Lord I want to serve you amen cuz it's him getting a he's got a grip Hallelujah and he's not going to let go of that grip amen because we have a man that has bridged the way this word has bridged the way Hallelujah so I'd start speaking amen don't let the devil hold you silent you talk to God you don't hold your peace Hallelujah now we're going to come back to this but I want to jump I'm going to jump well let's go here death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof so and I can say this your death or your life is in the power of your own tongue amen your life or your death is in the power of your own tongue if you say yes amen you will receive if you believe it and confess it you say yes it's true and you'll receive life but if you doubt it and confess that doubt you'll receive death so what are you wanting to do now if I can you know this is the problem with slideshows we jump around but you see Esther here now Esther's come to a position she's been elevated to become Queen over over the me and Persians she's standing in her position I her people are under a death sentence this is where she is she's the only one Mori tells her in the previous chapter perhaps you have come into the kingdom for a Time such as this that you can use the office that the King has placed you in am mean that your people can receive life and not be destroyed as the law that hmon had the King right would would would come into effect and so now here she is and and previous to this chapter I didn't put it all in just a save time but previous to this chapter she's gone into the presence of the king she's found Grace in his sight as she did to begin with hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't Esther's own ability that that that gave her favor with the King that she became Queen she listened to hagi hagi knew the heart of the king I mean so she arrayed herself as Hagi said and then and then the king fell in love with her because when the king saw Esther he saw what his heart was Hallelujah she saw this is a woman after my own heart Hallelujah and it says the Bible says that she found Grace or or favor in the sight of the king now have we not found favor in the sight of the king I just I just say Lord lift our faith may we not be afraid to step in our god-given position take our god-given rights amen but haven't we found favor in his sight it's not him that willth or rth but God that shows Mercy has he showed you Mercy amen hallelujah amen hasn't he shown you Grace amen so she's a afraid to go in before the king but but then she does go in a raid in her royal apparel and and it's a death sentence to go in before the king without being invited but the king wants his Queen by her side by his side amen so so so she goes in he he uh lifts out his Royal scepter that means she's pardoned she touches the scepter then the King asks what is your request you know this is God the Lord say what do you need what do you need what do you need no no I'm asking you you should I trust there's some cogs moving in your heart or in your soul saying Lord I have a need and and and you see many times when when Esther goes and before the king what do you need what's your request and God wants us to speak our request to him amen you see here's Esther's Esther's remember I oh I know I've said it before Esther has two things on her heart the Deliverance of her people and the destruction of her enemy this is why she's G him before the king Hallelujah she has an enemy we have an enemy you know brother Bram says the devil hates me I hate him we got to we got to come to this conclusion the devil's not our friend he's not here to help us he's not here to guide us in any way that would be good am mean he has nothing he has no good intention towards us one iota amen he wants to destroy us and if he had his way we would be all in unbelief and doubt in some place in the world that's right or some co cold formal religion somewhere if he had his way but God had his way God has had his way Hallelujah so here comes Esther and friends we've got a role to play we're going to take our role we're going to take God has God has said you're the bride that's right Hallelujah you just can't look at the script and say well that's neat no you got to step into the scene Hallelujah so she comes in and says now so what's your request and and he just said she just says to the king I want to invite you and hon to a banquet of wines so they have their first banquet and then now and then we come to this piece of Esther where the king can't sleep Hallelujah the king can't sleep sleep what's going on it's amazing what the difference between day and night and day a changing of a day means a whole much in the scripture I was going to go to Ruth I I'll leave Ruth for maybe a later later date when when she comes to the threshing FL floor at night then there's the rising of the son and then Ruth comes into a union with Boaz huj Hallelujah well we'll leave that that one's just free but you know you you we're living in a different seasonall we're living in a different season we're not living in a season of a death sentence under us no we're live or over us rather we're living in a season of Deliverance we're living in a season of Jubilee we're living in a season of freedom I mean we're living in the season of The Rapture that's the season the bride is living in hallelujah we're no longer an oppressed woman am me we brother saw the vision of a man man who looked like his dad but wasn't his dad and a woman who looked like his mom but wasn't his mom and she was on the ground all beaten up and and and that man had that three-edged club and every time the woman would try and get up the man would beat him down beat her down that was a trinitarian spirit every time the bride would try and stand on her feet I mean that that religious trinitarian spirit would beat her down and that spirit is still in the world today I mean either in formalism or liberalism any of those things it just beats the people down why cuz it produces unbelief in them they can't Ascend in faith to their god-given position but friends we're not under that Spirit no more that man with the club has been defeated he's been cast out of this place am mean that we can come onto our feet and say Lord I'm standing in my position I'm standing in my god-given rights that nothing can beat me down no more hallelujah we're living in that season are so you got to play your role hallelujah we're not a downtrodden people no more am so if we're not downtrod no more we're going to take our role h stand on the stage and we're going to take our god-given position the devil always tries us do you think the devil says oh yes here's the bride I'll help you come on what can I do no he doesn't want to help you he's trying to push you back he's trying to stop you possessing your inheritance but you've got to speak to him you've got to call his bluff he is nothing but a bluff but you got to call his bluff if you don't call his bluff then he will still be a bluff in your face I mean but you've got to show him you got to tell him what he is and the thing is when you begin to speak then God comes in behind you listen to so many prayer lines at the end God comes down and brother Brown just just just gives a mess prayer and he and and and he and he's talking to the Lord then he begins to address Satan he says Satan you've held these people for long enough I rebuke the in the name of Jesus Christ you're not afraid of me but you're afraid of the god who's present and He commands the devil to get out and and then you can hear it on the table it's like a power breaks and then people begin to rejoice and go free Hallelujah why because the devil's cast out of the place and people can rise in faith and receive what they need Hallelujah that's the same thing here friend the devil's not here he you know don't let him pin you down we're not called to be pinned down we're called that he would be under our feet and we would go Victorious that's why you've got it you've got to speak through your lips oh so and so praise me oh so and so praise me that's all very well and good but you've got to take the word yourself you've got to speak it in faith yourself you've got to address your enemy yourself amen and tell him to get out in the name of Jesus Christ that's what you've got to do but the devil tries to shut you up saying well you're not worthy you know you have no Authority you can't do this and he's nothing but a bluff am mean cuz the blood of Jesus Christ makes us join ears with Christ Hallelujah so if Christ defeated hey Christ Our Lord Jesus went down to hell defeated Satan in Hell took his keys off him rose up Victorious death couldn't hold him no Devils could hold him no Devils could stop him in this earth Hallelujah and now God's made us a join a by the blood of his son he's made us join ear so if our lord Jesus was Victorious what are we going to be victorious Hallelujah you going to say well oh my friends yeah brother BR sisters like a goes all mil milk in the building a real Faith Bank comes we've had meetings like that people have seen it Go all milky over the place why cuz the atmosphere comes right that God can come down and you can begin to speak to your God and God can move on your behalf am Hallelujah this is a supernatural gospel Hallelujah this message is a supernatural gospel it's not a bunch of nice arguments putting quotes together and nice lectures no it's God living hallelujah it's God manifesting himself and we just have to come to conclusion God you're here to lift me into a position in you and you're determined it's going to happen so I'm not going to get in your way God take me lift me mold me change me whatever you need to do fill me with the Holy Ghost hallah don't let the devil distract me it's amazing you think about you know people would say when they when you know brother Braham was there he says now he's here and Billy Paul and many others said he didn't need to say that cuz the atmosphere just changed when the angel of the Lord stepped onto the plat for and yet he' begin to call people out and he'd say they're missing it lord they're missing it and then even God would give enough Grace to reveal the person's name so God is you just think about how how how how deceptive the devil is where God can be speaking directly to you right he can be speaking directly to you and to your need but yet the devil's got us distracted some way that's why I said God don't let us be distracted don't never let the devil never let the devil tell you you well you know you just got to survive a bit longer this this is not Survivor church can I survive God moving another another service this is not what this is about it should be Lord here I am I raise my hands I give up Lord change me mold me do what you want Hallelujah take my heart take all my unbelief away take all my resentment away do what you will but the Devil comes in and Whispers In you out no don't listen don't respond just be quiet have your and then you go out the same way well if you keep doing the same thing you know brother BR said when he was 12 when he was 12 years old he would have given his heart to the Lord but a demon Spirit was hanging over him telling him just wait a bit longer right the devil is here to fight God is here to fight Hallelujah God is here to fight but the devil's here to try and stop the visitation of the Lord hallelujah we should not you know whenever something says to you don't go forward don't raise your hands don't actually listen is that God well then why do we listen to him oh but what about tomorrow and all the things I've got on and and the devil gives you your itinerary of tomorrow that's right and you to start going through it you say hold on that's right take no thought of Tomorrow am but he says what about tomorrow Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday take no thought tomorrow and it goes what I'm say sure we should plan but he gets you busy in service the devil gets you busy I remember the so so the first church ever God ever the first ever Fellowship I went to was a Pentecostal Church you know but then the Lord but I was listening to brother Braham the Lord gloriously transform me but then I then I got led to a message Church down in Christ church and then there's a voice I start you first few Services I went to this voice was saying to me get out of here get out just walk out get out and I said devil no you get out amen Hallelujah why didn't that happen at the Pentecostal church cuz here in the message is where the truth was and the devil was fighting me where the truth is and the devil always fights where the truth is hallelujah so if I was you and you know there's a voice saying just leave or don't come or whatever you actually think now would God want me to stay away it's the devil you got to you you really just got to think now who's talking to me who's talking to me if it makes you feel all all all broken and down and and discouraged what voice is that if if it tries to fill you with unbelief and I'm not even a Christian I don't even know if I'm going to make it who's talking would Jesus say you're not going to make it is he going to come to brother James and say James I'm sorry you're not going to make it you might as well just go do you think God would do that do you think God would do that to part of his word part of his bride no sir but then we we we we entertain the devil he you he brings his picnic basket he lays out all this unbelief and stuff eat this try this look at this oh you'll never make it you don't understand you're too young you know got to think Satan business hours are closed get out that's what you got to do so I'm too busy oh please hold throw the phone away your Call's not important to us hallelujah why do we listen to Satan listen to the Lord so so here we are now here's here's Esther and so she had this first banquet of wines with the King now the king can't sleep and that night it says on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of The Chronicles and there was read before him the king and it was found there in that Mori had told of uh Biga and and cherish terish two of the king chamber the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on King of hazus and the King said what honor and dignity hath been done to morai for this then said the king's servants that ministered unto him there is nothing done for him what happens now here comes the records of the Kingdom that were sealed up put in the archives then now the book comes open before the king the book comes open before the king and then so the king's asking what reward has been given to this man for saving my life Ro reward he says nothing's been done and then you go from this moment now then now uh Hon's y yo Hon's out there cuz the devil always hangs around where God is he can't find his own party amen he can't find his own party he just tries to wreck what God is doing so Hon's hang around in the outer court and then and then the king says where who's in the outer Court then hmon comes in I don't know how we'd walk in you know and then and then the king asked him what should be done to a servant that the you know King should highly reward and hmon because the devil thinks it's all about him so um well have him right on the king Ste he begin to think what's the greatest thing that that that that the king would cuz he going to do it for me you you know he's going to do it for me cuz cuz the devil's self-absorbed you know he's very self-absorbed that's why you see people who are self-absorbed and lovers of pleasure you know of the you know lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God what are they that's Satan in them fall of Nature and so he just thinks well let's have H have the servant on you know the king's horse and you know raiding his robes and the crown on whatever and then so now the king says good do all that but for morai and then so hmon shocked but then hmon has to do it so now so now hmon has to go through the streets with morai on the king's horse with the king's crown the king's robes and then so now here here is here is morai on the king's horse and H say this is how God um how how the king rewards his subjects whatever does everyone know the story I'm just ad liing but go read it it's very good and then and then hmon does this and he goes back to his house he's feeling so down and and then his wife begins to talk to him is morai a Jew you shall not Prevail before Mori if he's a the seed of the Jews whom you've already begin to fall before but then now he's called to another banquet of wines the book came open there's a change in the Kingdom because the book came open Hallelujah now when the book comes open the enemy gets exposed brother Braham says that the opening of the seals the devil is exposed in the opening of the seals that's why we are not ignorant of his devices hallelujah amen amen we see him work working in this world we don't have to say what's going on just say well I'll show you you want you want current news amen you you you you want current events go read the message that's right amen go read the message and you'll see what's going on in this day Hallelujah so the book comes open and then hmon begins to fall and then Hon's exposed by the queen but now she's got to speak she can't just say come to church Lord we're going to have a banquet of wines well how is church a banquet of once there stimulation by the revelation of the word that's why we get happy cuz the word anoints us and we get stimulated we we go you know we begin to Rejoice what's happening we're having a banquet of wine I'm passing the bottle today everyone should drink this one Hallelujah everyone should drink this one and drink as much as you can as fast as you can Hallelujah this is what we do this is why we get happy I trust you get happy y you been to sing the songs of Zion I'm one of them what's song and you may have come in all down and downcast and it just it's like it just get shaken off and Hallelujah this is who I am amen and then we hallelujah hallelujah I come here for a good time I trust you do too amen and then so now so so the king is now asking Esther what is your request because the king knows there's more there's a reason why there's hmon me and queen this is not just something to fill an evening what's going on he wants to know and God he knows everything but he wants you to tell him he wants you to talk to him about it Hallelujah he wants you to tell him the details and what's going on and so here's the king there's a reason Esther what's all what's all this about this is not what he uses but this is just me and then Esther now exposes the devil this is what hmon is doing my life is under a death sentence not just me but all my people if we were just slaves if we were just going to be sold into slavery I would have held my tongue that's what you said but because we're under death sentence I cannot you I need to speak and then the king gets mad you know our God is not mad at us you know Jesus is not mad at you who knows that no no no you got to know that he doesn't get mad you know it's like a child learning to walk you say well I trip and fall so many times like a child learning to walk you they start like this and they fall over then they fall over again and they knock themselves is there any parent in the world that as soon as a child starts walking starts getting angry at the child because they fall over no they're like come on you can do it pick them up dust them off here we go go again they fall over again but but there but there's something in them they want to walk amen you don't have to tell a kid you know you there always comes an age when every able-bodied child walks right and you don't have to tell them okay now we're going to walk come on and Coach them and this is how you do it there's just something in them they see you and something in them that says I want to do that Hallelujah that's why you got to look into the word see how Jesus was you say I want to do that or you listen to the message see how brother Brown was God using him I want to do that I want to see that kind of victory in my life and then we begin to walk then they pull themselves up walk along furniture look at me look at me and then they then they push out you could say into open open space it can get a bit scary Hallelujah but not one parent rebukes a child for falling over they're proud amen look at all the first step you know how we always going to capture the first step and and and and and we don't just want a photo no more we want video Hallelujah and then as soon as we get it it's just all over the world on Facebook Little Johnny made their first step now another another parent will would might say well that's cool but but the parents themselves they're like they're getting older they're growing up Hallelujah and the older they get the better relationship I can have remember when they're just a little baby you just go you know and that's and that's as deep as your fellowship is but then they begin to say Daddy and Mama it gets a bit deeper then their sentences for this reasoning begins to happen what the relationship gets deeper as they get older am hallelujah amen just when they begin to put words together amen yeah it's just like talking I know I'm repeating myself but no parent ever gets mad at a child for not perfectly speaking speaking right the first time they start with Dad or Mom and then maybe you know that's just like us and God we get birthed Hallelujah doesn't matter what age we are physically we have we get birthed and then we start trying to walk with the Lord because there's something in us I want to walk with you God I want to walk with you I want to I want you to hold my hand yeah I remember the first time I held Anisa's hand I was like I'd walk along like this and she's up like this you know cuz she's so short but now it gets a lot easier cuz now we're getting some height Hallelujah and now we can Skip Along and we can sing and we can do things that it wasn't the same when she's just holding on for dear life cuz he's going to fall over but you know but because a child gets older you can have better relationship and it's the same thing with us in the Lord he doesn't get mad at you when you fall amen amen he doesn't get he doesn't get angry at you because you fall he wants to pick you up amen hallelujah the Bible says he's our Advocate and an advocate works on our behalf amen amen he doesn't work against us he's not like a real estate agent nothing against real estate agents but he's nothing he's not like a real estate agent trying to get the best price out of the buyer and and for the seller but at the end time I mean but but in reality he just wants to biggest cut for himself that's why he wants the highest price so he's really working for himself right in that way trying to like a selfish motive God's not like that he's all for us I hope that's an all right analogy you know God is just he's our Advocate and that's why the Apostle Paul said if God before us who can be against us no one can be against us and so you so so God isn't mad at us I said all that just to say God is not mad at us he doesn't get angry at you just because you fall it's not him that falls at him that gets back up Hallelujah remember God doesn't run his business um brother Braham says God doesn't save you one day to lose you the next day God doesn't run his business that way amen someone who's actually has real salvation their heart is Lord I want to serve you no matter what and they always have a hunger and a thirst for truth amen not for religion people can have all the religion they want but it's a hunger and thirst for more of him hallelujah amen so he doesn't save us to lose us you know our names are on the Lamb's Book of Life written before the foundation of the world God doesn't rub them off am he can't rub it off amen Hallelujah if our name is there it can't be taken away I'm not talking about the book of life I'm talking about the Lamb's Book of Life those are all those are all the names of his redeemed and your name was there before the foundation of the world but God knew when you had come and then God sent his message to you amen and then you would respond to it in the way you have because God is telling you your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah that no no one can erase that name hallelujah hallelujah to God Amen so we just need to Rejoice that's what I say we should just be happy Hallelujah now I'm going to try and widen this up so anyway Esther speaks to the king the king gets mad we have to we have to talk to our Lord that the wrath of God is falling upon the Devil I'm not talking about people but against the devil that his wrath is poured out against Satan himself but he is waiting God is waiting for you because you he is the high priest of your profession so you have to tell god what the devil is trying to do against you so if he's on your case you say God the devil's on my case or if he's against your family you tell God about it do not keep silence you tell God what's going on in your situation I mean that cuz God just get mad amen God doesn't you know there's only one emotion that the devil uh God has uh towards the devil mad he just gets angry you know you've made this creation you no no God knew it was going to happen but well well okay I'll just take my three girls okay I won't use names cuz you say oh that was the devil no it's not but you know one spends literally a week dur this picture and then the other one just comes in picks up a pen just go you know and then the other one gets real upset that's like the devil you know God spent however many years building this Creation The Devil comes with this big pen of sin you know tries to wreck it up wouldn't you get mad I know it sounds ridiculous well yeah wouldn't you get angry that what do you do you know so the devil is God's enemy Jesus did not die to make peace with Satan he he died to make peace with you the devil is not redeemable you are redeemable that's why your heart is yes Lord I want to serve you yes Lord your word is true amen hallelujah hallelujah amen okay now we're just going to read this and we're going to I'll maybe pick this up another time now I'm going to I'm going to read this in English English this is from um uh the breach message what is this book of redemption I'm saying we have a man remember John wept because he saw no man was found worthy in heaven to take that book of redemption and he knew if no one took the book then all then then then everything was in Jeopardy because Redemption is a purchasing and a claiming right so you so Jesus purchases on Calvary but now he has to claim his bride and this is what this message is it's a claiming message well it's claiming those who are the names in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah that's why it's spoken to you like it did amen glory to God so now he's so he's there saying and and it went much because no man was found worthy to take the book there were Angels there that they never sin but no man was worthy the prophets were there Hallelujah all the redeemed were there but no man was found worthy to take the book now what is this book of redemption this title deed this abstract title deed you say abstract what does abstract mean means it's searched all the way back to its beginning amen just like you have a bit of property and an abstract deed is that there's no claims against that piece of property once all the claims have been strucken off then the buyer can purchase it amen now um uh you take like that little drop of ink this morning when it struck that bleach and went all the way back and when Sinners confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract goes right back to the Creator again you become a Son of God Abstract title deed is held in the hands of the almighty oh my it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my says brother BR claps his hands once what ought that do ought to do to a born again Christian it's legal possessions that abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost amen hallelujah hallelujah we believe it amen amen amen they were Gods over the Earth tree move there mountain move there hallelujah amen everything that he lost they lost we are in possession of Amen now that means you possess everything Adam and Eve lost fewu what a uh what of it brother the possession of that deed Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he lost it he had sinned and had separated himself from God was on this side of the chasm and he could not redeem it he couldn't do it cuz he needed Redemption himself so he could not do it but the law required a kinsman redeemer the law of God required a kinsman redeemer you want to mark that down kinsman redeemer we find it in Leviticus 25 now kinsman redeemer is a family member who has the ability ha you know has the money to do it has the will to do it and can redeem that's a kins and Redeemer but had to be part of the family hallelujah amen and that's why our lord Jesus became part of the family he became part of Adam's Fallen race Hallelujah that he could that that that so so he had to become a Kinsman he fulfilled his own law he became a Kinsman he had the price to redeem and he had the desire to redeem Hallelujah that's why when he died on Calvary he paid it in full there's no interest needs to be paid off no other down payments it wasn't just a deposit it was paid in full and he had a desire for this cause I've come into the world what to redeem my bride amen hallelujah hallelujah amen that ought to make you real happy hallelujah how do I not part of the family of God because his word in this hour has spoken to us like nothing else amen hallelujah this message I trust when you hear it it's not just some other religion or some other idea but you hear the voice behind the voice amen you hear God's voice speaking yes hallelujah amen glory amen amen we he says we don't have time to thoroughly search this wait am I in the right place wait that didn't sorry here we are we uh we uh we won't have time to thoroughly search this CU we know each text would take a night se but God's law required a substitute now if God had not offered to take a substitute but love constrained him to do it that man was without a way back there's no way for him to get back he was gone but the grace of God meet this kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ law required it Grace met its requirements Oh Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that that God's law required an innocent substitute Hallelujah now so God's law was met you know the law required it and Grace it met in the person of Jesus Christ Our Kinsman now I'm just going to hurry through this then we'll then we'll quit this is imperfect love uh uh perfect faith and when we were Sinners alienated without God in the world and that muck of mud as I told talked about this morning God came to us God sought you you never sought God no man can come to me except the father draws him first aren't you glad the father Drew you and God came down into that mck that where you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love amen hallelujah look what you was and look what you are hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I sometimes I enjoy going down memory lane Hallelujah glory to God Jesus amen what did that somebody that loves you hallah can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word amen amen he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand see he caught me and he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you was unloved uh unlovable but he changed you amen glory just like that CED sister said at uh that time in her testimony she said I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not what I want to be but then I'm not what I used to be amen she know she had come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if God when I was an alien from him love me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence then he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that was unsa that you know that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took besides you but he took you amen no one can take your place amen you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you Hallelujah and then he says now now then won't Your Love reach right back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is it circumstances is going by this love that creates faith that God loves you and you love God and you love one another and that brings the faith all right then it can't it can't keep from bringing out just exactly what God promised it would do Hallelujah when we all lost in the muck of sin one day but we have a man Hallelujah we have someone who found us the Lord Jesus found you amen and and lifted you up brought you out of the myy clay Hallelujah shouldn't that produce a perfect love perfect love casts out all fear fear hath torment amen that he saved you and I Hallelujah let's have the musicians come please but friends we have someone we have a man Hallelujah I trust you just love love him this morning amen amen perfect love creates a confidence in his word amen don't let no doubts get in the way hallelujah hallelujah youo brother says only perfect love will get you into that place amen but when God gets a hold of us fills us with his holy ghost we have perfect love hallelujah it's not like you meet him and then have to get perfect love right it's one and the same amen hallelujah so shouldn't we just let our love project to him isn't he worthy isn't he wonderful isn't he glorious amen that he would save Sinners such as us hallelujah amen let's stand shall we but friends don't hold silence we shouldn't be afraid to talk to him amen hallelujah amen I want to I want to sing um I Heard brother Jeremy sing it I want to uh yeah let's just sing it um I am redeemed but there was another verse about Satan being mad amen and then we'll pray oh let's just sing can we sing um do we do we have it so glad I'm Yours Lord let's just Worship the Lord do we
