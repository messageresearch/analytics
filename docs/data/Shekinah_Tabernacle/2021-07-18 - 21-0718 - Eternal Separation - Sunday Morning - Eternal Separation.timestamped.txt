[13:43] church this morning
[13:44] who's ready to give him glory amen i'm
[13:47] ready
[13:48] amen not because i got myself but he
[13:50] made me really amen
[13:52] oh yeah you know he gives life wherever
[13:54] he is there's always life
[13:56] there's resurrection there's power there

[14:12] he is a restorer and i just want to just
[14:14] encourage you this morning
[14:16] when it comes to giving praise to god
[14:18] we're about to sing songs who likes
[14:20] singing songs
[14:21] you know when we sing now
[14:25] where regardless if you feel up down
[14:27] left or right
[14:28] or centered let's be centered i like
[14:30] being centered but you see wherever
[14:32] you're at
[14:33] it doesn't change how worthy he is it
[14:36] doesn't change you might be down
[14:37] you might be having a hard week a hard
[14:39] month a hard year or a hard hour
[14:41] whatever it may be or rejoicing it
[14:43] doesn't change how worthy he is
[14:45] so i encourage you this morning don't
[14:47] base how you worship today and praise
[14:50] on how you feel because he's worthy
[14:53] so give him you're not a hypocrite if
[14:55] you give him glory and praise and you
[14:56] dance and shout and inside you're not

[15:02] glory he deserves regardless
[15:04] of circumstance and i can guarantee you
[15:07] if you do that sincerely now don't put
[15:09] it on you really believe it he will

[31:30] okay
[32:12] that's a hard act to follow
[32:22] i'm just a tiny testimony while they're
[32:24] sitting in a music stand please
[32:29] so i came down here with a heavy heart
[32:32] because we all go through trials and
[32:34] times in our lives when
[32:38] you know the lord seems further away or
[32:41] you
[32:41] feel like you've moved away or something
[32:44] like that
[32:46] and i had negative thoughts going around
[32:50] around around
[32:51] my head making tracks get
[32:54] deeper and deeper furrows as we do
[32:59] and it had been going on for quite a
[33:01] while
[33:02] and so i thought ah
[33:05] in my my heart wanted to be down here
[33:08] with the saints i really love the
[33:10] fellowship here i feel very
[33:14] welcomed and part of you of course we
[33:16] are
[33:18] part of each other
[33:20] [Music]
[33:22] but in some ways i was looking to the
[33:24] world to fulfill
[33:27] that need that i had i thought oh i'll
[33:30] go for walks in nature
[33:32] then i might get rid of these negative
[33:35] thoughts
[33:36] um i'll go to the zoo and i got to pet a
[33:38] kangaroo and that was awesome and
[33:40] and i thought oh that that'll take it
[33:43] away from me and um
[33:45] walk to the through the bird sanctuary
[33:47] and i'll be out amongst god's creation
[33:50] and that'll take it away from me
[33:54] and i'll walk through town and along the
[33:56] waterfront but all those things whatever
[33:59] the lord
[33:59] had whatever the world had to offer as
[34:03] our sister saying it was so
[34:06] shallow there was nothing it was
[34:09] beautiful god's creation but i couldn't
[34:11] it didn't fulfill me it didn't take away
[34:14] that that it didn't it wasn't the need
[34:18] the need wasn't met it was like a
[34:20] bandage over the top or something
[34:23] but it wasn't until there were two
[34:24] sisters during the the days that i've
[34:26] been down here and there was two
[34:28] separate sisters who didn't know my
[34:29] circumstances they didn't know this
[34:32] thing they'd be going on negative in my
[34:34] head
[34:35] and the lord used them
[34:39] through the body to speak to my heart
[34:42] and
[34:42] help deal with my
[34:46] how to handle those negative thoughts
[34:49] and i just really really thank the lord
[34:51] that he came down
[34:53] through those sisters spoke the words i
[34:56] needed to hear
[34:58] and i believe by his grace
[35:02] that i have the victory so i i just
[35:04] thank the lord
[35:07] it's amazing
[35:16] sorry
[35:20] it doesn't sound it's not 100
[35:25] perfect it's got all the gold in the car
[35:28] i think oh
[35:32] i want to be in tune with the lord
[35:34] [Music]
[35:38] um yeah

[35:45] oh thank you i'm sorry
[35:52] it's the d give me a give me an

[36:08] like it reaches the top with a red line
[36:10] [Music]
[36:24] a little bit high it's too high
[36:43] yeah thank you my brother
[36:47] gotta stay tuned
[37:00] so many times i've questioned
[37:06] certain circumstances
[37:08] [Music]
[37:10] or things i could not
[37:14] hope i mean understand
[37:18] [Music]
[37:21] many times in trials
[37:25] weakness blurs my vision my frustration

[56:44] integrity
[56:46] what all the great characteristics
[56:49] law that a man could aspire to are all
[56:51] from you lord jesus

[56:56] lord we feel at home being in your
[56:57] presence
[56:59] lord as the song says i'm going home
[57:01] there's nothing holding me here lord
[57:02] there's
[57:03] nothing about the atmosphere of this
[57:05] world
[57:06] lord the the evil negative atmosphere
[57:08] that we enjoy
[57:09] lord or the things that it produces
[57:10] there's nothing about that that we enjoy
[57:13] lord but we enjoy your presence heavenly
[57:14] father
[57:16] lord and that's why he said come just as
[57:18] i am without one plea but that thy blood
[57:20] was shed for me and that thou
[57:21] bids me come to thee o lamb of god i
[57:23] come lord of me thank you that you made
[57:25] a way

[57:43] lord and we
[57:44] we endeavor to put our own thoughts and
[57:46] our own desires and everything aside
[57:48] lord to let the spirit of god
[57:50] have the free have liberty amongst us
[57:52] this morning lord we know that's where
[57:54] victory is that's where change is that's
[57:55] where hope is
[57:57] not in things that we can offer lord but
[57:58] in the things that you offer in your
[58:00] word lord and in your ways and your
[58:01] spirit
[58:02] so we just pray you'll continue to bless

[58:23] was glad when they said let us go into
[58:24] the house of the lord
[58:26] and i was just
[58:29] praying last night and as i was

[58:42] i just enjoy laying down or praying
[58:44] whoever i am and just

[58:47] god comes and it makes you feel
[58:50] good it's never bad it's never it's
[58:52] never darkness it's
[58:53] never negative it's always positive the
[58:55] spirit of god is always positive

[59:13] here this morning and i think the law is
[59:16] gonna do great things for us this
[59:17] morning i mean i'm looking forward to
[59:19] to what he has in store i really enjoyed
[59:21] the special sister k
[59:26] um i can probably name on my hands on
[59:28] one hand
[59:31] the powerful times when there's been a
[59:32] song special and it impacts you maybe
[59:34] for the rest of your life you can look
[59:35] back and think well that was powerful
[59:37] and that you just made the top five that
[59:40] was a very
[59:42] that yeah it was very anointed
[59:46] the other one was when sister analyst
[59:48] you did a song remember that song you
[59:50] did
[59:50] and it was about the um it was a
[59:52] christmas one
[1:00:04] and there was other words in it
[1:00:09] no it was um
[1:00:15] yeah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:18] that's very powerful praise the lord
[1:00:20] it's nice to have these landmarks in our
[1:00:22] life
[1:00:23] um okay i i
[1:00:27] i've got a little thought on my heart
[1:00:28] this morning that i i would like to
[1:00:30] share with you and it
[1:00:31] at the start it may seem like it's going
[1:00:32] another way but i've got another
[1:00:34] direction i'm going to head at the end
[1:00:35] of it
[1:00:38] but i just want to say before i start
[1:00:40] that i i really appreciate
[1:00:42] all of you you people here as the body
[1:00:44] of christ
[1:00:45] i do really sincerely appreciate you all
[1:00:48] and you mean a lot to me and this
[1:00:50] fellowship means a lot to me
[1:00:53] and just i know brother impo and i will
[1:00:57] and whoever comes up here we always do
[1:00:58] our disclaimers at the start you know
[1:01:00] before we
[1:01:01] before we speak because we feel that's
[1:01:03] the right way to go about it but
[1:01:06] i think i i just feel in my heart to say
[1:01:07] this just just to
[1:01:10] to make it clear and i feel like i can
[1:01:14] when i moved to wellington i i just
[1:01:16] finished running a church in
[1:01:17] gisborne and it was very enjoyable
[1:01:21] in one sense but when i left i had no
[1:01:24] desire to ever do it again
[1:01:26] or to speak again or anything it didn't
[1:01:29] it wasn't in me to want to
[1:01:31] do it not saying that i wouldn't but it
[1:01:32] wasn't in me to want to
[1:01:34] i had i felt another calling of the lord
[1:01:36] to to
[1:01:37] to do so when i came here i didn't have
[1:01:39] a burden to
[1:01:41] want to do anything in a
[1:01:44] if i could say it in a really in a
[1:01:46] ministerial sense
[1:01:48] if i could put it that way but when i
[1:01:51] came here i said to brother ben
[1:01:53] i want to support you as best as i can
[1:01:56] and i said talk is cheap we can say
[1:01:59] something you know this is what i'm
[1:02:00] going to do but you know time will prove
[1:02:01] what if what we spoke was we meant it or
[1:02:04] not you know so i said look
[1:02:06] don't take my word for it but you'll see
[1:02:07] over time that i'll be here for you and
[1:02:09] i'll support you
[1:02:11] in whichever way that i can and that
[1:02:13] means if you want me to speak i'll speak
[1:02:15] although i don't want to if you want me
[1:02:16] to i will to support you it means
[1:02:18] anything you want from me
[1:02:19] i'll do it because i want to support you
[1:02:21] i want to support the fellowship
[1:02:23] and and
[1:02:28] i can say i can that's why i end up up
[1:02:30] here not because i
[1:02:31] asked to do it but i get asked to do it
[1:02:34] and i can't say no because i've said to
[1:02:38] the lord well i told him i'd support him
[1:02:39] and if he needs some help i'll get up
[1:02:41] i'll support him
[1:02:43] you understand that's why i do it i i
[1:02:45] like i was sitting in the room back
[1:02:46] there getting ready
[1:02:48] for the sermon and i didn't didn't even
[1:02:50] want to sit in the in the pastor's
[1:02:51] checks i thought man i just don't want
[1:02:52] to do that job
[1:02:53] i don't want to that's very hard you
[1:02:55] know and i've got a lot of respect
[1:02:56] for ministers of the gospel you don't
[1:02:59] understand i've got a lot of respect in
[1:03:00] my heart for ministers of the gospel
[1:03:02] it's not easy and anyone that aspires to
[1:03:05] do it and is eyeing that position up
[1:03:07] when you get there you'll find it's not
[1:03:08] like what you thought it was and you
[1:03:10] there's a good chance you wouldn't you
[1:03:11] won't enjoy it when you get there
[1:03:13] you know but but i really respect men of
[1:03:17] god that stand up and
[1:03:18] and like pastors and ministers and i
[1:03:21] really respect them
[1:03:23] so i'm so happy that brother ben does it
[1:03:25] and i don't have to do it and i can just
[1:03:26] be a support
[1:03:28] is that a right to say that yeah
[1:03:33] and and i feel i think
[1:03:37] i feel before the lord that i've that
[1:03:38] the calling here to just serve brother
[1:03:40] ben and help out as much as i can i feel
[1:03:41] like i've done that
[1:03:43] to the best of my ability it's
[1:03:46] it's something you think lord i'm i'm
[1:03:48] you know when the lord gives you a
[1:03:49] little job and a job description you say
[1:03:51] yep lord i'll do it you know
[1:03:52] if you feel good when you can do it for
[1:03:53] the lord you know and
[1:03:58] and the spirit of honesty i think i can
[1:04:00] say this and i won't say it for too long
[1:04:02] but
[1:04:02] you know i've done a lot of things in
[1:04:04] this church a lot of different roles
[1:04:05] i've had and i've tried to offload every
[1:04:06] single one of them and you all know i
[1:04:08] have
[1:04:08] all the time i'm trying to offload every
[1:04:10] single job that i've got to someone else
[1:04:12] it doesn't quite work but i've been
[1:04:13] trying to do that but
[1:04:15] the yeah i can say this the only thing
[1:04:18] that the only position that i've wanted
[1:04:19] to hold on to has been a
[1:04:21] a um trustee
[1:04:25] just because when i was in the other
[1:04:26] church i was people start doing a lot
[1:04:28] and the money gets to people and it
[1:04:29] started
[1:04:30] i was manipulated through that
[1:04:34] but money doesn't mean anything to me
[1:04:35] whether i've got a little or a lot the
[1:04:37] lord knows in my heart i don't care
[1:04:39] it doesn't hold me you know it's like
[1:04:41] it's just a tool for the lord
[1:04:43] whatever it honestly the lord knows that
[1:04:45] the day of judgment you know that's the
[1:04:46] truth it
[1:04:46] doesn't mean anything to me so i've said
[1:04:49] brother ben the only position i want to
[1:04:50] keep is that position not because i want
[1:04:52] control over it but because i don't want
[1:04:53] anyone
[1:04:54] else to control you over it you know so
[1:04:56] i want you to do whatever you want with
[1:04:57] it whatever you feel led
[1:04:58] and i'm here to make sure that you get
[1:05:00] to do what you want with it you know i
[1:05:01] don't want
[1:05:03] i i just couldn't bear the thought of
[1:05:04] people be like a minister being
[1:05:06] manipulated by that so
[1:05:08] so that that's the only the only reason
[1:05:10] why i've wanted that that because i know
[1:05:12] the lord knows
[1:05:12] lord it doesn't mean anything to me or
[1:05:14] not i'm happy when he brother ben
[1:05:16] can move forward in the lord he doesn't
[1:05:17] have to worry about that part of his
[1:05:18] life
[1:05:19] but that's enough about that i just
[1:05:20] wanted to just put that out there just
[1:05:22] to
[1:05:23] just to so you know my position of why i
[1:05:26] end up
[1:05:27] up here you know but i've got a nice
[1:05:31] thought on my heart this morning
[1:05:32] and you can bring up the slide there i
[1:05:35] had to sit down because my sermons
[1:05:36] sometimes have scripture
[1:05:37] verses later on and throughout it also
[1:05:39] and
[1:05:40] this is a thought called eternal
[1:05:42] separation
[1:05:44] eternal separation and it's a very
[1:05:46] powerful thought oh yes please bro
[1:05:48] eternal separation and
[1:05:54] in a way it's a very negative thought
[1:05:55] and and the way that the thought came to
[1:05:57] me as i was listening to a sermon
[1:05:59] was thank you
[1:06:02] was it a negative context but i just
[1:06:04] want to um just bear with me as we go
[1:06:07] through this because it's a very
[1:06:08] powerful thought and it's actually a
[1:06:09] very great thought
[1:06:11] eternal separation and
[1:06:15] the scripture that i that
[1:06:18] the scripture that's loosely based on is
[1:06:20] this one colossians 2
[1:06:22] 13 and you being dead in your sins and
[1:06:25] in the uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:06:27] has he quickened together with him
[1:06:28] having forgiven all your trespasses
[1:06:32] now i've got a bit of a lengthy reading
[1:06:33] from a quote of brother brandon but i
[1:06:35] want to read through it all you will
[1:06:36] know the
[1:06:37] you will know the quote but i just want
[1:06:38] to read through this all because it gets
[1:06:39] to the point at the end of this
[1:06:41] this message if you can't see that it
[1:06:43] doesn't matter i'm just going to um
[1:06:47] can you see that
[1:06:54] i'm just going to read it anyhow because
[1:06:55] i want to i want to get this one
[1:07:05] some time ago in a large canadian city i
[1:07:07] was holding a meeting
[1:07:09] and when i come from the the great arena
[1:07:11] a lovely meeting that night
[1:07:13] and i was in this great hotel now think
[1:07:15] about all the things in the story as i'm
[1:07:16] reading through it
[1:07:18] i don't know whether you have noticed
[1:07:19] have anything like it in the states
[1:07:24] and i was going up on the elevator and
[1:07:26] noticed whiskey bottles laying in the
[1:07:27] elevator
[1:07:29] and also that afternoon there'd been a
[1:07:30] great bunch of american
[1:07:32] americans come up there an organization
[1:07:34] a society a lodge and was having their
[1:07:36] annual get-together
[1:07:37] it was about five or six hundred
[1:07:38] americans there and they were really
[1:07:41] having a time
[1:07:43] and when i got off the elevator all down
[1:07:45] each floor when you would pass
[1:07:47] you would hear the hollering as it would
[1:07:48] go past the floor he'd hear the
[1:07:50] hollering and the foyers and and the and
[1:07:53] the screaming and the dancing
[1:07:54] and they thought they were having a good
[1:07:56] time
[1:07:58] but that kind of life leads to a place
[1:07:59] to where man wants to get rid of that
[1:08:01] type of life they take a pistol
[1:08:03] and blow their brains out so david
[1:08:05] couldn't have been speaking about that
[1:08:06] kind of life
[1:08:07] now this is david that loving kindness
[1:08:08] is better than life itself
[1:08:10] but he's saying he's not talking about
[1:08:11] that life that they think is good it
[1:08:13] gets so miserable until people jump off
[1:08:15] bridges
[1:08:20] they take poison to end their life so
[1:08:22] david could not have been speaking of
[1:08:23] that type of life
[1:08:24] and when my elevator stopped i heard a
[1:08:26] noise down along the hall
[1:08:27] and i looked and here come two american
[1:08:30] women just with their underneath clothes
[1:08:31] on
[1:08:32] and i'm probably 28 26 somewhere along
[1:08:35] in their years old under 30 perhaps
[1:08:37] mothers
[1:08:38] only in a miracle way of thinking it's
[1:08:40] just a little clean fun
[1:08:42] it's dirty black sin the bible said she
[1:08:44] that lives in pleasure is dead while
[1:08:46] she's alive
[1:08:47] but oh we think that's innocent fun it's
[1:08:49] the gates of hell
[1:08:50] and these young women perhaps their
[1:08:51] husbands at home playing the babysitter
[1:08:55] while they're stitching so party was
[1:08:56] having a little fun drunk as they could
[1:08:58] be
[1:08:58] with the underneath clothes on only a
[1:09:02] bottle of whiskey in their hand
[1:09:03] and men pulling them from room to room
[1:09:05] just a little clean american fun
[1:09:09] what do you think god thinks about that
[1:09:11] and maybe a man
[1:09:13] there pulling these woman with his
[1:09:15] innocent wife at home sitting with the
[1:09:16] babies
[1:09:19] brother branham's just come from a
[1:09:20] meeting a powerful meeting
[1:09:22] where the spirit of god is and he's been
[1:09:24] preaching and he turns up at his hotel
[1:09:25] to this
[1:09:28] so you can imagine why he eventually
[1:09:30] spoke out about it because he was in
[1:09:31] such an anointing
[1:09:33] just a little fun with the boss
[1:09:36] and i stepped back in a little place
[1:09:40] inside inside somewhere and they were
[1:09:42] coming down staggering
[1:09:44] beautiful woman and they stopped and
[1:09:46] passed the bottle one to another
[1:09:48] and pulled up their little skirt of the
[1:09:50] thing they had on they're under this
[1:09:51] skirt they threw it up they
[1:09:52] threw out their legs in the air and said
[1:09:53] whoopee this is life i just couldn't
[1:09:56] stand it any longer
[1:09:57] i stepped out i said you're mistaken
[1:09:58] lady that's death
[1:10:01] she turned and looked at me i walked
[1:10:03] over to them i had this very bible in my
[1:10:04] hand i said i'm a preacher of the gospel
[1:10:07] i and i too am an american and you call
[1:10:09] that life you deceived
[1:10:11] the devil has deceived you that's the
[1:10:13] road to hell and eternal separation from
[1:10:15] the presence of god
[1:10:19] so put yourself in his shoes he's just
[1:10:20] come back from this meeting
[1:10:22] ministering he's got a powerful
[1:10:23] anointing and he turns up to his hotel
[1:10:25] room
[1:10:25] to the scenario and he's thinking about
[1:10:27] all the things that it could be and he's
[1:10:28] just looking at it and
[1:10:30] he's just thinking about the sin that's
[1:10:32] going on all around him
[1:10:34] and eventually he can't take it anymore
[1:10:37] because maybe he was just gonna hide in
[1:10:38] the shadows there and let the thing pass
[1:10:40] but there's such a powerful anointing
[1:10:43] economy just had to go out and say
[1:10:44] something
[1:10:47] and in the end he said that's the road
[1:10:50] to hell an eternal separation
[1:10:52] from the presence of god eternal
[1:10:54] separation from the presence of god
[1:11:04] now the thought i want to speak on is
[1:11:05] eternal separation
[1:11:07] but i'm going to cover it in this way
[1:11:09] first before i go to another angle
[1:11:13] now when we talk about death
[1:11:16] we ask the question what exactly is
[1:11:18] death
[1:11:20] death is just a separation from life
[1:11:23] that's what death is
[1:11:24] when you die you separate from life it's
[1:11:27] a separation from life that's
[1:11:29] that's how you would determine death
[1:11:33] i got this quote here and god in the
[1:11:35] garden of eden when you pronounce death
[1:11:36] upon the human race
[1:11:38] that day you eat thereof that day you
[1:11:39] shall die every human being
[1:11:41] and death means separation and that's
[1:11:43] the reason we call it death
[1:11:45] for one another we just separate from
[1:11:47] one another because if somebody is alive
[1:11:49] and then you are no longer alive you
[1:11:51] have separated because
[1:11:53] death is a separation from life
[1:11:57] now there are two deaths that exist
[1:12:01] there are two deaths one death is a
[1:12:03] separation
[1:12:04] from natural life when i naturally die
[1:12:07] and you're naturally still alive
[1:12:09] then we will separate so i will die and
[1:12:12] you live
[1:12:12] so now we separate the second death
[1:12:16] is that we separate from spiritual life
[1:12:20] that's the that's the crucial one is the
[1:12:22] second death
[1:12:23] when we separate from spiritual life
[1:12:27] that's that's the important one that we
[1:12:30] don't want to miss out on
[1:12:32] that's why revelation says and death and
[1:12:35] hell were cast into the lake of fire
[1:12:37] this is the second death this is the
[1:12:38] second eternal separation
[1:12:41] from spiritual life it's an eternal
[1:12:43] separation there's no coming back it's
[1:12:45] forever
[1:12:46] in this space that's why i wanted to
[1:12:49] just cover this real quick that's why
[1:12:50] there's not an eternal hell
[1:12:53] when there's an eternal separation from
[1:12:55] life now god is the only source of life
[1:12:57] that there is
[1:12:58] there is no other life outside of god it
[1:13:01] that is
[1:13:02] the complete essence of what life is
[1:13:03] dwells in god
[1:13:05] so if you're eternally separated from
[1:13:07] that life
[1:13:09] then you must have an end at some point
[1:13:11] you cannot eternally go on forever being
[1:13:13] separated from life
[1:13:14] because you you're eternally dead
[1:13:18] you've got eternal separation that's why
[1:13:20] there's no eternal hell eventually hell
[1:13:21] is going to finish
[1:13:23] not exist anymore because you can't have
[1:13:25] eternal life and how otherwise god's
[1:13:27] life would be there
[1:13:28] keeping it going it's an eternal
[1:13:30] separation eternal separation
[1:13:35] now this is where we get deceived and
[1:13:38] this is how the world gets deceived
[1:13:40] as we end up in this scenario where
[1:13:44] we can be connected to a natural life
[1:13:47] and separated from spiritual life
[1:13:50] this is where all the trouble starts
[1:13:52] right here is in this scenario
[1:13:55] i can be a man or a woman i'm not going
[1:13:57] to say me because i'm eternally alive
[1:13:59] but a man or a woman can be alive here
[1:14:02] and dead over there
[1:14:05] it's possible if you're dead over there
[1:14:08] you can't be alive here
[1:14:10] no you can be alive here and dead over
[1:14:12] there and this is where all the deceit
[1:14:14] comes in
[1:14:14] it's because people can think they're
[1:14:15] alive like those women that said whoopi
[1:14:17] this is life
[1:14:18] brother adam said you're dead you're
[1:14:21] dead
[1:14:23] that you are actually dead you think
[1:14:25] you're alive and i'm having a great time
[1:14:27] you're actually if you carry on down the
[1:14:28] road you are no you are presently
[1:14:31] eternally separated from god presently
[1:14:34] that's why the scripture says
[1:14:35] you who who were dead in trespasses and
[1:14:38] sins
[1:14:39] while you were sinning you were dead
[1:14:42] you were dead not you were still alive
[1:14:45] because you had the ability to sin but
[1:14:46] while you were in that state you were
[1:14:48] eternally separated from god
[1:14:50] you were as good as dead you were dead
[1:14:52] in trespasses and sins
[1:14:54] so that's why the scripture here says
[1:14:57] here it is and you're being dead in your
[1:14:58] sins
[1:14:59] because while you are sitting you're
[1:15:01] you're actually dead
[1:15:06] has he quickened together with him
[1:15:07] having forgiven all your trespasses when
[1:15:09] we are saved
[1:15:10] it's it's the second death that we get
[1:15:12] saved from so we can be alive here and
[1:15:13] alive there
[1:15:14] that's the situation and that's why this
[1:15:16] scripture says but she that lives in
[1:15:17] pleasure is dead well she yet lives
[1:15:20] she's spiritually he or she it's not to
[1:15:24] do with a man and woman but
[1:15:25] those that live in sin are actually
[1:15:28] dead they're dead that's it
[1:15:32] the next stop for you is eternal
[1:15:34] separation from
[1:15:35] the presence of god which is life that's
[1:15:38] the way this works there's no other way
[1:15:39] about it
[1:15:41] but i love the scripture hear that hath
[1:15:42] and here let him hear what the spirit
[1:15:44] saith unto the churches he that
[1:15:45] overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[1:15:46] second death
[1:15:47] there's an overcoming for the believer
[1:15:49] this is not all negative there's an
[1:15:50] overcoming for the believer
[1:15:52] where the second death is not going to
[1:15:54] harm us you know we we
[1:15:55] and that's what this is all about we're
[1:15:57] going to overcome the second death
[1:15:58] because we're all going to face death in
[1:16:00] this life actually our promise is a
[1:16:02] rapture but that's just a
[1:16:04] that's like a body change that's as good
[1:16:05] as we sort of bypass this whole get old
[1:16:07] and die and
[1:16:08] we'll have an accident and die we just
[1:16:09] sort of bypass that little bit and we go
[1:16:11] from here to
[1:16:12] the there you know this body change we
[1:16:14] don't see death
[1:16:16] we we take a little shortcut if i could
[1:16:18] put it that way because death is just
[1:16:20] you got to go through this journey but
[1:16:21] there's
[1:16:22] there's a group of people that will go
[1:16:24] you know and the
[1:16:25] moment in a twinkling of an eye we won't
[1:16:27] taste natural death
[1:16:29] and we won't taste spiritual there some
[1:16:30] of us will never taste death whatsoever
[1:16:34] we're quite a fortunate people no one
[1:16:35] else could actually say that he not
[1:16:37] could
[1:16:37] actually never he never tasted death he
[1:16:40] just
[1:16:43] now we talk about eternal separation
[1:16:47] separation means you're eternally
[1:16:49] separate from something
[1:16:51] and in this case death is an eternal
[1:16:54] separation from
[1:16:55] life from god and all the pleasant
[1:16:57] wonderful things that life offers
[1:16:59] you think about love you've got an
[1:17:01] eternal separation from any form
[1:17:02] whatsoever of love
[1:17:04] human beings have a form of love here
[1:17:05] because it's part of god right but
[1:17:07] that will be gone when you're eternally
[1:17:09] separated from god or joy
[1:17:11] any any joy that you could possibly
[1:17:13] experience so these are attributes of
[1:17:15] the spirit of god
[1:17:16] so if you take away life you take away
[1:17:17] all the attributes as well
[1:17:19] and how there will be no joy when you're
[1:17:20] returning eternally separated from god
[1:17:22] there is not one ounce of joy imaginable
[1:17:24] whatsoever
[1:17:25] you think when we get in a bit of a
[1:17:27] depressed state there are still ounces
[1:17:28] of joy here and there
[1:17:30] we're not totally void of joy completely
[1:17:34] it still exists and we could maybe be
[1:17:35] depressed and see an animal at the zoo
[1:17:37] and say
[1:17:38] hi that's quite a nice animal and we get
[1:17:40] a moment of joy for a small amount of
[1:17:42] time it still exists but
[1:17:45] in this place of eternal separation that
[1:17:47] doesn't exist there is no possibility of
[1:17:48] this thing ever
[1:17:49] coming to us or peace no possibility of
[1:17:52] peace
[1:17:53] ever existing in that realm
[1:17:56] any sort of goodness any gentleness any
[1:17:59] anything up
[1:18:00] that's a part of the spirit of god will
[1:18:01] not be there it's an eternal separation
[1:18:03] an eternal separation forever gone see
[1:18:06] we
[1:18:07] people can live and live be dying here
[1:18:10] but actually experiencing these things
[1:18:11] well there on earth and that's the
[1:18:12] deceit about it that's what this whole
[1:18:14] modern thing about love is you just love
[1:18:16] everyone
[1:18:17] love everything makes you feel good but
[1:18:19] it's wrong
[1:18:20] see and you're on the road to eternal
[1:18:22] death but that in itself is another
[1:18:23] deceit
[1:18:25] okay now i'm going to
[1:18:29] segue just a bit here because i want to
[1:18:33] pull the picture out a bit and talk now
[1:18:34] about the about a bigger
[1:18:39] happening that we are actually a part of
[1:18:41] as we speak
[1:18:43] as we speak this is what we are a part
[1:18:46] of
[1:18:47] and this is to do with the three stages
[1:18:49] of this earth that we live on
[1:18:50] and this is an event that is an exciting
[1:18:53] event
[1:18:54] for us and it's the three stages of this
[1:18:57] earth of what we're going through
[1:18:59] the first stage was when god made the
[1:19:03] earth and he made it perfect
[1:19:04] and he put life there this thing called
[1:19:07] life
[1:19:08] the thing that we're talking about his
[1:19:09] own life he
[1:19:11] breathed in man the breath of life and
[1:19:12] the man became a living soul and
[1:19:14] all around man was life when it was just
[1:19:17] adam and eve before the fall it was all
[1:19:18] life that's what existed here
[1:19:21] so that was the first state you see that
[1:19:23] little word life up there
[1:19:24] that was the first state now
[1:19:28] we had a scenario now where death and
[1:19:30] life were then mixed together
[1:19:33] in this earth that was now the second
[1:19:35] stage that that this world had to go
[1:19:37] through
[1:19:38] the scripture says while man slept his
[1:19:39] enemy came and sowed tears among the
[1:19:41] wheat
[1:19:42] and he went his way this thing called
[1:19:43] death was sown into this
[1:19:45] thing called life so we had a world now
[1:19:47] that was mixed with death and life
[1:19:49] that was the situation we found
[1:19:51] ourselves in
[1:19:53] stage two stage three was
[1:19:56] we get this end stage where i saw a new
[1:19:58] heaven a new earth for the former heaven
[1:20:00] and the first earth were passed away
[1:20:01] everything that
[1:20:02] every part of sin then existed and there
[1:20:04] were no more season it was a
[1:20:06] it was a the place again that had no
[1:20:09] death at all it was it was we have a
[1:20:12] world
[1:20:13] waiting for us actually this world
[1:20:16] that's full of life
[1:20:18] okay but there's a funny
[1:20:21] there's a situation in the middle here
[1:20:24] where there's an eternal separation
[1:20:25] happening
[1:20:27] an eternal separation think about this
[1:20:31] there was once life and death on the
[1:20:33] earth
[1:20:34] and if there's going to be a time where
[1:20:36] there is then only life there's an
[1:20:37] eternal separation
[1:20:39] for mankind happening as we speak that's
[1:20:41] why there's so much trouble in the world
[1:20:43] where the world is in a process of
[1:20:45] eternal separation
[1:20:46] of separating life and death it's
[1:20:49] separating
[1:20:50] that's that's what we are involved in
[1:20:52] right now
[1:20:54] a thousand years ago it wasn't the
[1:20:55] situation there was not this eternal
[1:20:57] separation happening it was
[1:20:59] because it wasn't the time yet people
[1:21:01] were going to dwell together and
[1:21:02] god was going to work his work within
[1:21:03] what he had to work with but now there's
[1:21:05] an eternal separation
[1:21:07] and actual physical eternal separation
[1:21:08] happening that's why the world is going
[1:21:11] the way it is that's why it's going
[1:21:13] crazy because there's becoming a
[1:21:15] separation it's separating
[1:21:18] there is a separation happening
[1:21:22] and one in one context in the bible it
[1:21:23] calls it a uniting there's a there's a
[1:21:25] uniting but it's
[1:21:26] it's evil uniting together and good
[1:21:27] uniting together he said take the tears
[1:21:29] and bind them
[1:21:30] do the harvest bind them put them that
[1:21:33] way
[1:21:34] put the put the tears this way put the
[1:21:36] wheat that way there's a separation
[1:21:38] and when you have a separation you have
[1:21:39] differences and everything is starting
[1:21:41] to become
[1:21:42] intense because of this eternal
[1:21:44] separation
[1:21:46] god is doing an eternal separation upon
[1:21:48] the earth as we speak
[1:21:50] good and evil are separating light and
[1:21:52] darkness life and death are separating
[1:21:54] worldwide this is an event that nobody
[1:21:57] else in the history of time will ever
[1:21:58] experience this event
[1:22:00] the the event of sin coming in was a
[1:22:02] great event but i'm not trying to be
[1:22:03] funny about this but there was not
[1:22:04] really anyone there to see it
[1:22:05] apart from only a couple of people you
[1:22:08] know but it was a
[1:22:09] it was a the magnitude between the first
[1:22:12] and the second was massive
[1:22:13] but there was only a few people to
[1:22:14] experience it but we are actually at
[1:22:15] this other point where
[1:22:16] there's a separation happening between
[1:22:18] life and death on this world
[1:22:22] we can even see it with israel going
[1:22:23] back to their homeland and god beginning
[1:22:25] to deal with the jews
[1:22:26] because there's a separation happening
[1:22:28] he's almost done with us
[1:22:30] he's pulling away dealing with the jews
[1:22:32] there's this big separation
[1:22:33] there'll be a time that's why the word
[1:22:35] says that him that is righteous be
[1:22:36] righteous still with him that is holy be
[1:22:38] holy still him that is filthy be filthy
[1:22:40] still
[1:22:40] because then it's like the end of
[1:22:41] separation now we just have to part our
[1:22:43] ways but
[1:22:44] that's the end of the separation that's
[1:22:46] it whoever's on which side you're on
[1:22:48] that's it we
[1:22:49] we're finishing up so we're at this
[1:22:52] we're at this point
[1:22:53] now i want to just twist this around a
[1:22:54] bit and then
[1:22:56] go to the other side and say what
[1:22:58] exactly is life then we say i've got
[1:23:00] life
[1:23:01] what does it mean when you're alive it
[1:23:02] means you're separated from death
[1:23:04] i'm alive how do you know your life well
[1:23:06] because i'm not dead
[1:23:08] i'm separated from death and as long as
[1:23:10] you're separated from death you're
[1:23:12] technically alive
[1:23:13] who enjoys being separated from death
[1:23:15] it's a great thing to be alive
[1:23:16] christians love to be alive
[1:23:18] i'm separated from death so now it's not
[1:23:20] just all negative this eternal
[1:23:21] separation is not just all negative
[1:23:24] it is if you're going to eternally
[1:23:25] separate to death but what if you're
[1:23:27] going to eternally separate to life
[1:23:29] then it's a very positive experience for
[1:23:32] the believer
[1:23:33] to be eternally separated from life
[1:23:35] that's why now
[1:23:36] now you say this what is eternal life
[1:23:39] to be eternally separated from death
[1:23:42] eternally separated from death
[1:23:44] and and to be eternally separated from
[1:23:47] anything at all that
[1:23:48] is related to death you think that
[1:23:51] depression where does depression come
[1:23:52] from the pit of hell
[1:23:54] it ain't going to be there in this place
[1:23:57] of eternal life because
[1:23:58] there's an eternal separation from
[1:24:00] depression
[1:24:01] there's only going to be joy that's all
[1:24:03] that is in the presence of god is joy
[1:24:04] there's an eternal separation from that
[1:24:06] any sort of worry anything like that any
[1:24:09] strife there's an eternal separation
[1:24:11] from that
[1:24:11] it's an eternal separation any hatred if
[1:24:14] you feel any
[1:24:14] bitterness there's going to be an
[1:24:16] eternal separation from that that's what
[1:24:18] eternal life is and eternal separation
[1:24:20] from death
[1:24:21] these two won't be together anymore
[1:24:23] they're going to be
[1:24:24] separated eternally never never to
[1:24:27] bother you
[1:24:28] anymore that's what this eternal life is
[1:24:31] and all these here's another one all
[1:24:32] these
[1:24:34] things here that that that plague us and
[1:24:36] that that
[1:24:37] that are just evil hateful things
[1:24:40] the lord knows if i had a i guess i can
[1:24:42] say this sometimes i
[1:24:44] marvel at the patience of god because i
[1:24:46] think lord i get so frustrated when i
[1:24:48] see
[1:24:49] evil around me and i just experience it
[1:24:51] if i had a button to push to end it all
[1:24:53] i'll just push it
[1:24:55] boom done that would be it
[1:24:58] i mean god knows i mean that i'm glad
[1:25:00] for the the long suffering of god that
[1:25:02] he's got a plan and amongst all this
[1:25:03] mess he's got a plan and he's
[1:25:05] getting people out and separating them
[1:25:07] out that's what he's doing at the moment
[1:25:08] he's long suffering
[1:25:09] because that's part of his qualities
[1:25:11] long suffering
[1:25:14] now we are on this part of life
[1:25:17] that are going to eternally separate
[1:25:19] from death okay
[1:25:21] now this is the place where we are at
[1:25:23] right as we speak that's what's
[1:25:24] happening
[1:25:24] in a global sense in a worldwide sense
[1:25:27] is that where
[1:25:28] we are the beginning the process because
[1:25:29] we believe we're on god's side
[1:25:31] we're in the process of eternally
[1:25:32] separating from death
[1:25:34] the bride is now now i'm going to take
[1:25:37] it this way for a bit because i want to
[1:25:38] bring something in
[1:25:40] to show you this is only going to be a
[1:25:41] short message this morning because i
[1:25:42] want to
[1:25:43] drive this little point home here this
[1:25:46] morning
[1:25:49] and in a global sense you had this you
[1:25:51] have the world you've got life then you
[1:25:53] had to mix them with death
[1:25:54] and then you had it there was a
[1:25:55] separation coming out
[1:25:58] and it went back to life again now
[1:26:00] brother browner preached a sermon called
[1:26:01] the third exodus
[1:26:03] and he's saying that the the first
[1:26:06] exodus was when
[1:26:07] the children of israel left egypt they
[1:26:09] made an exodus out
[1:26:10] the second exodus was when when when
[1:26:14] man went out of formality into the holy
[1:26:15] ghost into this this man's doctrine into
[1:26:17] the holy ghost
[1:26:18] you know with with in the book of acts
[1:26:20] when when that scenario happened and he
[1:26:22] said the third exodus is going from the
[1:26:23] holy ghost into the millennium
[1:26:25] moving out and that's the journey that
[1:26:27] the bride is on is in that third exodus
[1:26:29] leaving we're in that state there
[1:26:32] leaving all this death leaving all that
[1:26:33] nonsense this separation is happening
[1:26:36] that's that's our journey
[1:26:37] we are going from life and death to just
[1:26:40] this place of life this
[1:26:41] this great separation and eternal
[1:26:43] separation from all this mess
[1:26:45] all this depression all this anger all
[1:26:47] this hatred all this filth we're on this
[1:26:48] eternal separation to it
[1:26:52] now i want to type that to a story in
[1:26:53] the bible that we all know very well and
[1:26:55] it was
[1:26:56] and it was israel
[1:26:59] now abraham was was he was in the land
[1:27:01] and we're going to type them being in
[1:27:03] the land as as
[1:27:04] like his promise you know he was in the
[1:27:06] land of promise you call it the land of
[1:27:07] promise
[1:27:08] i love having a land of promise
[1:27:09] something we can anchor i hope into
[1:27:11] that's my land of promise there i'm
[1:27:12] gonna go there
[1:27:14] you think about the those that believed
[1:27:16] in the children of israel they had this
[1:27:17] thing in their heart the land of promise
[1:27:19] that land has promised to us well
[1:27:21] they're in egypt they knew lord i've got
[1:27:22] this land of promise and it's there
[1:27:24] and they could anchor their faith into
[1:27:26] that because the promises that be given
[1:27:27] to them but here was abraham he was in
[1:27:29] the land
[1:27:30] and he was in the land of promise and
[1:27:31] i'm going to type that to
[1:27:33] when he was there and his children they
[1:27:35] had
[1:27:36] we're going to type that to life they
[1:27:37] were there they were i know they didn't
[1:27:39] have the whole land but let's just type
[1:27:40] it as though they were in the land
[1:27:42] they had it and then through a different
[1:27:44] series of events
[1:27:46] when the famine came and things happened
[1:27:48] they were driven out of the land
[1:27:50] because of the famine and they had to go
[1:27:52] into egypt and end up in a scenario
[1:27:53] where they were outside of their land
[1:27:55] and they were mixed in with the
[1:27:56] egyptians and
[1:27:57] they were under the egyptians i'm going
[1:27:59] to call that this part here where
[1:28:01] you have life and death they were just
[1:28:02] all mixed together and
[1:28:04] then the egyptians started oppressing
[1:28:06] them after a while they were deceived
[1:28:07] into this too but the egyptians were
[1:28:09] just oppressing them every day they
[1:28:10] would
[1:28:10] they were slaves they would wake up in
[1:28:12] the morning and they had to be slaves
[1:28:13] and they
[1:28:14] although they had faith in their hearts
[1:28:15] they were mixed in with this
[1:28:17] with this thing called death called the
[1:28:19] egyptians they weren't they couldn't
[1:28:21] just go out and
[1:28:22] enjoy life they had to work they were
[1:28:25] slaves they were under this regime
[1:28:27] they weren't free they weren't free
[1:28:29] people they were under this
[1:28:30] slave regime which they hated and they
[1:28:33] knew in their heart there's a promised
[1:28:35] land for me back there that's where i
[1:28:36] belong
[1:28:37] for 400 years they were here but they
[1:28:39] had that word of promise that
[1:28:40] that's my land back there when i go
[1:28:42] there i'm going to be free that's where
[1:28:44] god is going to bless us that's where
[1:28:45] he's going to defeat all our enemies
[1:28:47] in that land and their whole goal was to
[1:28:50] get there that's where i want to get to
[1:28:52] anyone that was of faith that was the
[1:28:54] goal anyone that was an unbeliever maybe
[1:28:55] thought how can we work with the
[1:28:57] egyptians here and maybe
[1:28:58] i'll befriend a few other the guys and
[1:29:01] maybe i can make life here a little bit
[1:29:02] better for myself
[1:29:03] you're a fool if you do that if you're a
[1:29:05] jew and you had that mentality
[1:29:06] you had to walk in faith and um there's
[1:29:08] another land not this land
[1:29:10] and i'm going to get out of here and the
[1:29:11] ones that walked in faith would say lord
[1:29:13] get me out of here they would be praying
[1:29:14] you know
[1:29:15] and a lot of them did pray that's why
[1:29:16] the lord said i've heard the prayers of
[1:29:18] my people
[1:29:19] when he spoke to moses he said i've
[1:29:20] heard the cries of my people
[1:29:22] because there were men and women of
[1:29:23] faith that were crying out to god lord
[1:29:25] bring me to that land
[1:29:26] bring me out of this mess into that land
[1:29:29] right
[1:29:30] so now one day it happened one day it
[1:29:33] happened
[1:29:34] they went from egypt to the promised
[1:29:37] land they
[1:29:38] did this exodus this transition from
[1:29:40] there to the promised land right
[1:29:42] it happened so then now you can end up
[1:29:44] in this they separated from the
[1:29:46] egyptians they're separated
[1:29:48] for a while they'll mix them but then
[1:29:49] they then the time came where they were
[1:29:51] going to be separated and they
[1:29:53] for a group of them some of them died
[1:29:54] there and did their thing but
[1:29:56] a group separated out life and death was
[1:29:58] separated and they ended up back in the
[1:30:00] promised land
[1:30:01] okay that's that's my little that's my
[1:30:03] type there
[1:30:07] hell out here walking out very happy
[1:30:09] look at the looks on their faces how
[1:30:10] happy would you have been
[1:30:11] finally the thing you'd wanted for so
[1:30:12] long you were on your way out you were
[1:30:14] going
[1:30:15] you imagine that you've been a slave
[1:30:17] you've been under these safe masters for
[1:30:18] so long and then
[1:30:20] the next month you're walking out you've
[1:30:22] got all your positions on your back
[1:30:24] you've been given all the gold of the
[1:30:25] egyptians too they just gave them all
[1:30:26] their things and
[1:30:28] you were going you imagine that you
[1:30:29] imagine how happy you'd be right
[1:30:34] and they'd seen the power of god move in
[1:30:37] their midst they'd seen
[1:30:39] moses do these mighty miracles and they
[1:30:41] were just they were having a revival
[1:30:43] they were feeling real good and then
[1:30:45] they got to
[1:30:46] the red sea which
[1:30:50] geographically they'd actually shown
[1:30:51] where it was and it was like this
[1:30:53] you walk through this little crevice
[1:30:55] then it opens up to a massive big
[1:30:57] plane area where there's nowhere to go
[1:31:00] but either into the ocean or back the
[1:31:03] way you came
[1:31:04] because it was enclosed them by big
[1:31:06] mountains and they ended up in the spot
[1:31:09] and some of them began to murmur
[1:31:12] and say look moses you've brought us all
[1:31:14] the way here
[1:31:16] they've been on this great exodus but
[1:31:17] you've brought us all the way here just
[1:31:18] to die out here in the wilderness
[1:31:19] because they could see the egyptian army
[1:31:21] coming after them coming through the
[1:31:23] same place where they went back and they
[1:31:24] knew
[1:31:25] they're going to come straight through
[1:31:26] that little gap there and just come and
[1:31:28] slaughter us
[1:31:28] like flies you know we've got no hope
[1:31:30] and look out that's the most powerful
[1:31:32] army in the world
[1:31:35] and a lot of them began to murmur but
[1:31:36] some of them didn't but most of them did
[1:31:39] and complain and and be full of unbelief
[1:31:43] even though they were they were on their
[1:31:44] exodus they were out they were gone
[1:31:46] god had delivered them they were on
[1:31:48] their way to the promised land it was
[1:31:49] all happening
[1:31:52] and then moses spoke to them
[1:31:57] and said to the people fear ye not stand
[1:31:59] still and see the salvation of the lord
[1:32:01] which he will show you today
[1:32:04] for the egyptians whom you have seen
[1:32:07] today
[1:32:08] you shall see them again no more forever
[1:32:12] forever so god gave them a promise and
[1:32:15] said the egyptians that you see today
[1:32:17] i'm going to make an eternal separation
[1:32:19] between you and them
[1:32:21] you're not going to see them anymore
[1:32:23] forever there's going to be an eternal
[1:32:25] separation
[1:32:26] that you left there but they're still
[1:32:28] messing with you but there's going to be
[1:32:29] an eternal separation you see them today
[1:32:31] they're going to be gone forever they
[1:32:32] will not trouble you anymore
[1:32:34] they're going to be gone there's going
[1:32:35] to be an eternal separation between
[1:32:38] you and them you will see them no more
[1:32:41] forever
[1:32:42] right you'll see them no more forever
[1:32:47] but i want to ask you this when did the
[1:32:49] prophecy take effect
[1:32:51] when moses came and spoke to them and
[1:32:53] said that prophecy when
[1:32:55] did suddenly god make up his mind uh
[1:32:58] okay i didn't know this was going to
[1:32:59] happen i didn't realize you'd be stuck
[1:33:00] on this little peninsula
[1:33:02] and the egyptians were going to come
[1:33:04] have a meeting with
[1:33:06] people and say look we've got to figure
[1:33:07] out a plan here and come up with a night
[1:33:09] with us
[1:33:10] with a way to defeat these people okay
[1:33:11] i'll tell you what this is what we'll do
[1:33:13] uh we'll drown them in the sea let's
[1:33:15] quickly rush down and tell moses
[1:33:17] hey yeah we've seen the situation
[1:33:20] and and we've decided that yes um this
[1:33:22] is now what's going to happen
[1:33:23] um we're going to drown them in the red
[1:33:25] sea so you go across and then we'll
[1:33:26] drown them in there
[1:33:28] he didn't rush out and not know this was
[1:33:30] going to happen
[1:33:32] it wasn't at that point it wasn't when
[1:33:33] moses told the people that they were
[1:33:35] going to be gone forever that they were
[1:33:37] going to be gone forever
[1:33:41] they were going to be gone forever when
[1:33:42] they left even before they left they
[1:33:44] were going to be gone forever
[1:33:45] the prophecy was there it wasn't
[1:33:48] when they needed it it was it existed
[1:33:50] there think about it i want you to think
[1:33:52] about this now
[1:33:52] it existed there that's when the
[1:33:54] prophecy existed was
[1:33:56] when they were leaving okay this is an
[1:33:59] important
[1:34:00] now let me just segue for a little bit
[1:34:02] here right i know
[1:34:04] this is a voting booth who's voted
[1:34:07] you go on a vote and
[1:34:11] and then throughout the day you go to
[1:34:13] this one that one and you
[1:34:14] put your vote in and then they at a
[1:34:17] certain time they start bringing all the
[1:34:19] votes back to the
[1:34:20] counting rooms and these these people
[1:34:21] count them and modern technology is
[1:34:23] great they're sending all this
[1:34:24] information through to the
[1:34:25] these days it's run by the news media
[1:34:27] they're the ones that call the elections
[1:34:28] right but
[1:34:29] they send it back to them and they get
[1:34:31] these live feeds of
[1:34:32] of who this one's got a thousand votes
[1:34:35] this one's got 1
[1:34:36] 100 and they're watching the scale go up
[1:34:38] and down throughout the
[1:34:40] evening now
[1:34:43] there's a certain point in
[1:34:47] over the course of the evening that
[1:34:50] there are computer programs and and
[1:34:51] people analyze the situation
[1:34:54] and there's a certain point even when
[1:34:55] the votes are still being counted
[1:34:57] that they will say actually you know
[1:34:59] what even when the votes even though the
[1:35:01] votes are still being counted
[1:35:03] there is an impossibility that this one
[1:35:05] can this person cannot win and this one
[1:35:07] will win
[1:35:09] at a certain point in that process they
[1:35:10] say okay we've we've passed that point
[1:35:12] now
[1:35:12] if you look at the averages this many
[1:35:15] have always gone to this guy
[1:35:16] that many to that guy if that carries on
[1:35:18] the way it should and it generally will
[1:35:19] then this guy's the winner but
[1:35:23] and they will do what they will call it
[1:35:25] they will say right we're gonna call it
[1:35:27] we're going to call this area we're
[1:35:28] going to call that state we're going to
[1:35:29] call this we're going to call that now
[1:35:30] the voting hasn't been finished counting
[1:35:32] this the voting's still counted but
[1:35:34] they're going to call it they say all
[1:35:35] right we're going to call it this guy's
[1:35:36] won
[1:35:37] because it's an impossibility that the
[1:35:39] other one can win and very very rarely
[1:35:41] does that
[1:35:42] call is that call wrong because it's
[1:35:43] based on mathematics and how you can't
[1:35:46] you can't lose you know you're at that
[1:35:49] certain point
[1:35:50] now you understand how that works before
[1:35:52] the voting finishes
[1:35:54] well it's okay that guy hasn't
[1:35:55] officially won but let's just celebrate
[1:35:57] because he's going to win anyway this is
[1:35:59] we've won let's just celebrate
[1:36:00] okay this is an important
[1:36:04] you know what i'm saying here right now
[1:36:07] this is what i want to speak about
[1:36:09] about the scenario that we're in we're
[1:36:11] in this great exodus right
[1:36:13] same as these people were that prophecy
[1:36:15] they were going to win
[1:36:17] when they left they were going to win
[1:36:19] they didn't have to wait till the
[1:36:20] egyptian army was drowning in the red
[1:36:22] sea
[1:36:23] to know oh yes we can celebrate miriam
[1:36:24] got the tambourine out and celebrated
[1:36:26] they could have celebrated right here
[1:36:27] we've won we've won the odds are for us
[1:36:30] there is no way the egyptians are going
[1:36:31] to win
[1:36:32] we've won we've won this we won this
[1:36:34] whole thing it's in the bag people they
[1:36:36] could
[1:36:36] miriam should have started dancing when
[1:36:38] she was there
[1:36:39] walking out dancing we've won this whole
[1:36:41] thing oh but look the egyptians are
[1:36:42] still gonna run up run after you
[1:36:44] no we've won you don't understand we've
[1:36:46] won they can
[1:36:47] you can call and they they should have
[1:36:49] called an eternal separation right there
[1:36:51] i'm calling an eternal
[1:36:52] separation we've won these things that
[1:36:54] oppress me all of this stuff well i'm on
[1:36:55] this journey of one
[1:36:57] they're done i don't care what it looks
[1:36:59] like they're done
[1:37:00] we've won this whole thing it's in the
[1:37:02] bag we've won
[1:37:04] and this is where we need to be at as
[1:37:06] believers
[1:37:08] we're on this journey of eternal
[1:37:10] separation i want to declare to you
[1:37:11] we've won
[1:37:12] we've won it doesn't matter what it
[1:37:15] looks like it doesn't matter
[1:37:17] what what enemy comes on or anything
[1:37:18] like that we have actually we won
[1:37:22] we can call an eternal separation to
[1:37:24] anything that's bothering you today any
[1:37:26] anything that's of
[1:37:27] the death from the egyptians anything
[1:37:29] there you can just call it call it i've
[1:37:30] won that's it
[1:37:32] i'm done i've won call an eternal
[1:37:34] separation
[1:37:35] this is what i was speaking of two weeks
[1:37:37] ago when i just briefly mentioned that
[1:37:39] because i'm going through
[1:37:40] we always go through trials right that's
[1:37:41] why i appreciated the song this morning
[1:37:44] because that was what i wanted to
[1:37:45] actually speak about we go through
[1:37:47] trials and we understand that god wins
[1:37:49] that we can trust in his word we
[1:37:51] understand that through what we go
[1:37:52] through
[1:37:54] so as we go on that's why you go through
[1:37:57] one trial and then you may not
[1:37:58] go through it like you should you may
[1:38:00] have unbelief in there and start to
[1:38:01] doubt and then the lord pulls you
[1:38:02] through and you think why did i doubt in
[1:38:03] that trial i should have believed
[1:38:05] because look at the outcome right you'd
[1:38:08] feel silly when you're an
[1:38:09] israeli when you're a jew when you've
[1:38:10] been just crossed the red scene all the
[1:38:12] enemy has gone and you were the one that
[1:38:13] was complaining they're going to kill us
[1:38:14] and now oh they're all dead uh
[1:38:16] you know you feel silly and you should
[1:38:19] because you didn't believe
[1:38:20] there was unbelief from hell it's from
[1:38:23] hell you didn't you shouldn't have done
[1:38:24] you should have just believed you should
[1:38:25] have been
[1:38:25] taping the tambourine here going praise
[1:38:27] the lord we've won i'm going to call it
[1:38:29] the race isn't finished yet don't care
[1:38:30] i'm calling it we've won it's an
[1:38:32] impossibility that we're ever going to
[1:38:33] lose
[1:38:33] we're done we've won we won the whole
[1:38:36] thing
[1:38:37] and that's what the lord prodded my
[1:38:39] heart about
[1:38:40] when i went in a in this new trial i'm
[1:38:43] going through because you always get one
[1:38:44] you get one then
[1:38:45] that finishes you get another one
[1:38:46] already waiting for you you know it's
[1:38:47] lined up ready to go
[1:38:49] and i started to have a bit of doubt in
[1:38:50] the situation and the lord rebuked me
[1:38:53] and said why are you thinking that
[1:38:55] you have been going through this walk
[1:38:56] for too long to even think that thought
[1:38:59] why are you thinking it have i ever not
[1:39:00] delivered you in any situation
[1:39:02] have i ever not delivered you have you
[1:39:04] have you have i ever let you down
[1:39:06] then why are you thinking like that why
[1:39:08] are you calling eternal separation to
[1:39:10] that thought
[1:39:11] call it you've won call it just call it
[1:39:15] and i called it i'm like that's it i'm
[1:39:16] calling it a one
[1:39:18] that's it there's no more any that time
[1:39:21] that negative thought comes i'm done
[1:39:22] with it
[1:39:23] i've won i'm calling it there's an
[1:39:25] eternal separation
[1:39:26] where i'm going that thought doesn't
[1:39:28] exist
[1:39:29] therefore i'm on the way out of here i'm
[1:39:31] calling it you're gone
[1:39:33] i'm separating now i'm calling an
[1:39:35] eternal separation now that's where i'm
[1:39:37] at
[1:39:37] calling eternal separation anything like
[1:39:40] depression call it
[1:39:41] call it i'm calling the internal
[1:39:43] separations there it ain't gonna be
[1:39:45] where i'm going
[1:39:45] it's from where i just left then call it
[1:39:48] just call it
[1:39:50] we've already won we've won that battle
[1:39:52] anything that you go through if you've
[1:39:53] got any
[1:39:54] worry you worry about stuff we're on an
[1:39:56] eternal separation from worry just call
[1:39:59] it

[1:40:05] though they were that's what that's the
[1:40:07] situation
[1:40:08] that we can they're wearing and that's
[1:40:09] what we can do as believers just call it
[1:40:11] a one
[1:40:12] i don't i when we eternally separate
[1:40:13] don't think i'll just go through this
[1:40:14] and maybe the next one i'm you know
[1:40:16] i'm calling eternal separation to that
[1:40:18] no more that's
[1:40:19] i'm done they they could have caught an
[1:40:22] eternal separation to the egyptians and

[1:44:23] call it
[1:44:24] calling eternal separation and
