[Music] we all in my [Music] see Hosanna well sing yes [Music] Hosanna to the king Thank You Lord hallelujah glory well at this time I would like to invite brother Andy to the pulpit to give his report so he may be seated amen praise the Lord well do you know you already saw the reports that I was led to sin which was actually quite fun I enjoyed that it helped a lot and and being able to share what was happening and that the church could be with me on the trip and we could we could fight the battle together amen because it was a field that and as a field of work that has got many challenges on every level and you know the Lord really undertook for this trip and you know the itinerary so I don't need to tell you what happened because you've heard all of the things that happen but more it may be just a personal note on some of the things that actually the from my heart rather than just the facts so we obviously we got into the country and you know brother Adrian had been always telling me and sharing openly with everybody how this was the hardest field that he's ever had to work in because of the culture of the people and the culture of the Christians in Vietnam is as they want two things they want money and they want to build their Kingdom and then but I've filtered all through there as the bride and and you it's very difficult to find because they all act like the bride they all act like they want the word they want the truth and but they're actually professional swindlers you could say mixed all one through there and so you have to be your tact it has to be different and so this trip when we got there because Adrienne brother Adrienne has been working in that field for three years and really hasn't seen no one's really seen any substantial fruit that's lasted because things just get torn up all the time but this this trip when we arrived there were people that had previously been of a different nature had been changed and there were people and groups that the fruit of the Holy Spirit was starting to show and so that was really awesome I we one of the there was a few highlights and four and I'm just going on by the history of what brother Adrian had told me what it was like because I can only judge by what I see and and plus what I did on the Skype meetings with the people but being on the Skype meeting and being there in person is like a million times different because you can see the people who hang out with the people and you can really get a feel for the atmosphere and the church and groups and the living conditions and the culture and their challenges because it really is not like here really isn't like it this is we're really blessed really blessed man we are and you know nothing like a bit of contrast to make you appreciate what you have man but the unity is a responsibility that we have worthless blessing and God uses countries like this to take the message all over the world because we have the resource to do it and he we have been exposed to the message firsthand and the Lord has worked in our lives so that we can participate in the different forms of how we participate whether we're on the field or we're praying or we're giving or we're whatever we're doing to support the work that goes on all around the world God uses nations like this to actually go there because he and he's given that advantage not for our comfort not for us to just sit here and get fat on the word you know it's actually there's a purpose for us like to be what would to have what we have it's because God is going to use us for different things and I realized that so much when we went there because these people 1,000 percent disadvantaged and every area than us and but do you know when the word comes when the word comes things all change for them and when they get the holy spirit everything changes and when and the the the real the when they get the Holy Spirit but to get them to a point where they can get the Holy Spirit they have to really throw away that old culture that culture of I want money you guys pay me you know because that really was a it's been a privilege issue as like this is this is this is basically the expectation of a Vietnamese Church and these guys are spiritual people and they have testimonies and they they go back ties ins of people and do all the stuff and they've baptized correctly right but their expectation is that when we come we not only bring the word but we bring the food and we bring the supply of all of the resource and pay our own way pay everything pay everybody's petrol to get there this is what it's like and so you know when you turn that tap off and all you're bringing is the word at sins a real ripple effect and and so brother Adrian of Falcon is hard about a year ago to turn that tap off really well actually since he was there he slowly moved towards turning that tap off of giving the money and it's caused storms but now the storms are just settling and now the people they the the people that were all about money are kind of gone into the background and tried to cause revolutions and all the stuff but the true people the true children of God that want the word they want Christ they want the reality those people came forward those people came those people invited us back those people we had meetings with and brother Adrian see that's finally turned a corner where that whole atmosphere has been pushed back and the people that even stirred up these revolutions against the work the people that work because they Overlord at other people when there were groups under guys and they keep people under them and they didn't they felt because they we were connected to these people that they couldn't approach us directly but and then these people that because they were about money they started trying to push against us these people said to them would bring us directly and say I feel happy to ring you now because you're not dealing with this brother all that brother I feel happy to call you directly and so these and they were true and they want it all they want is the word and so it cut off these people because they were actually you know over lording all these other groups that cut them off and push them out so that these people that really didn't want the word could come forth hear the word and get born again because they were there was no other motive in their mind they weren't sitting in the pew because they knew they were going to get paid something for it they were there because they want the word and now that that's happening there is fruit starting to come and and I just want to thank you so much for your prayers because you know there was situations there where it was a showdown it was a real showdown and at what they weren't pulling that God's Spirit was anointing and pushing and ministering under a great Liberty actually amazing Liberty you know you wouldn't think you'd have liberty in a hostile environment and for me it was a it was a you know probably on a larger scale you know when when preaching in the pulpit that was the fear time for me to experience how in a hostile environment God can you can be an absolute Liberty to minister the word under such a powerful anointing and it's just opening these things up and and he's dealing with us right and out of the groups you'd find like two people that were really you know actually connected and they and those are the ones you could see them though the ones that invited us back took our minister and their churches so yeah that was that was one of the awesome highlights actually was that meeting in Sapa which was right at the top by the Chinese border and there was 40 ministers and these were ministers from like a denominational the Church of Vietnam one of the government style churches that are under government control basically and they're very kind of they're kind of a formal church and they have the Roman Catholic baptism and things like that but the way you know the Lord just opened his word to them and revealed himself and it was there it was it was a very special time and yeah we got two invitations back all of them got the message given to them on SD cards so we have the six hundred messages of Vietnamese translated onto into Vietnamese on the SD card and that's both in written and audio plus the Bible an audio and we were able to give them out so that's just awesome because you know everyone's working together the the giving that people give to these works and things like that that all helps to support these works and to be able to give the message out into these people's language as amazing because they need to hear the voice they've got to hear they need to have something that's outside of their usual teaching because once they're tapped into that and God's the bridegroom call comes through the message you know and it's going to bring the people out so that was one of the highlights another highlight was there was a brother who's been basically twenty years now now this is this is this will give you an idea of what it's like there 20 years he's been listening to the message his there's been missionaries going in there bringing the message only three months ago he changed that's 20 years of money taking money taking money putting on a front to get money and you end and it's it's very clear because of being under other people that were higher you could say in a hierarchical system that they put in place that was basically transferring that culture down and making sure that they're always calling for money three months ago this this brother and went from being in that money type of mode to coming into a Holy Spirit mode and actually we were we had a meeting and brother Adrian ancestor fall were both pleasantly surprised at the change of the whole church everyone there there was like seriously I felt like you know the three angels that came to Abraham and Abraham just did all the stuff with him I felt like that it was like wow there's something special here and I was surprised because they were telling me I we're only going there out of a token you know because they were expecting to them to be the same but go here and minister the word and was almost like one last time almost you know and we get there and it's changed and it was like you were welcomed and they wanted you there not because of us but they wanted the word and we were and we had the service and the Holy Ghost just came down into the service during the worship and from there it was just Liberty and they were rejoicing in the word and it was amazing and that shows that just shows you what it's like there that's 20 years of ministry going in there for years and years and years and then finally through the the reason the Lord dealt with them and he's telling us his testimony how he went through basically heavy heavy trial so six months he went through heavy trials and then came out a son of God came out converted came out from something real and not didn't want us there to try and take money and the Lord was able to minister there on honor on a heavenly economy you know and because this is liberating to people a heavenly economy Matthew 6 you know the economy of Matthew 6 don't worry about all these natural things put God first and all the stuff will be added because he doesn't want our worship to be contaminated with worry about natural things he wants us to be completely putting him first being generous and our giving to the to the Lord and then everything else will be added and these you know obviously in a lot more detail in ministry that came out but they were really capturing that because the opposite way that they were doing was cursing them financially because they were taking using ministers instead of giving to missionaries to help them they were taking from them and then they can't come under the blessing of of God's provision like that and now this this brother and his church they've changed and now God can actually supernaturally provide for them and and they've come into a new economy but not just financially but spiritually as well and so that was another highlight a real blessing especially for brother Adrian who's been here for a long time to see the change and then another brother brother fook his name is David he's got a piece I mean there's lots of other stories but I you know you've heard them already and I'll put them in the I'm gonna do a proper report in the beer now but I'll just do another highlight well you know the story of the of the sister that had the dream you know that was awesome it was so called we were you know I was actually you know we need to know that it's already happened you feel like menaces we're happen I'm I'm in this it was like that it was like we were inside the vision and it was really cool it happened about three times at least two times on the trip well I was actually sitting in a cafe in Saigon somewhere just north of Saigon and I'm sitting in this cafe having a jasmine tea and it was like I said to brother Adrian already I was like you know when that happens it's like you're you're in the mind of God you know and the intern of mine and yeah it was there that we discovered this this brother so he had been opposed not opposing the message but resisting the message and he had his eyes on another man being Elijah and this is a Negro man from somewhere in Africa very prosperity very prosperity preaching and by the Adriane three months ago preached the five comings of Elijah and the power of God came down into the church so strongly that the whole church was on the ground screaming out to God under the power of God and repenting of this other Elijah but the pastor wasn't the pastor was the only one that didn't and then since Adrian left the Lord put her on Adrian's heart know he knew that this guy is this man's gonna go through some heavy correction by the Lord and he did the Lord just dealt with him for three months he went through absolute trials and and then survived so when we came back he started translating for us at the start of the trip brother agency if this guy has changed he's completely different I even noticed it and because he had translated for us on skype but then he had gone off and furnished because of all the stuff that was going on he had finished and he had put his businesses and everything first before the work of the Lord and so and then and and and so when we came back brother you said this brother is different something's happen and he was all completely changed and so we he we left him and did our big tour of Vietnam right up to the top came right back down through and then we got we came back to him and in the process of that trip since the fall you know the Lord had led it in such a way that sister Phan would no longer be going on any more trips with us because it's just too hard for her and she was under this Vietnamese attack because of the climate that you work under there the political climate is very hard and there's a lot of opposition and so she was she's under like super attack from all these people and just directly insulting her and everything that's really intense and so she said she just can't do it anymore so from basically from her doing all of that because she's got an administration gift she can organize all the hotels and everything really and translate for us to get us around and wait from her to now here's this brother David who's got two big 18-wheeler trucks in a bear taxi business we said to him we asked them will you come with us on our trips full time and he said yes and that's like a miracle because you know this for him to say yes he's got to put down his whole business and do it out of love for the Lord and and he and it was just amazing that the Lord actually because of all the stuff he went through he realized that to put God first was like it doesn't matter what it what you think if God's calling you to do something you do that because he's going to actually supernaturally undertake for your life and he's and he said yes oh I'll come with you on all of you right around the country so that was an awesome development then we had some meetings at his house and found out that he has accepted that brother branham is Elijah and his church is listening to the message their Bible studying and you can see the character and the church you can see the condition of the fellowship and the character of the sisters and the fellowship as just that's amazing Annie and brother agent said if you would be as six months ago you would not even recognize them this is the change that job God has made and he said this is a corner this is like something that's happened he said this country is going into a new season it's going it's coming into a new season finally after all of the bloodbath that it's been through because it's been very hard so keep praying for them and just keep praying that the Lord will because these these churches those just the highlights but there was about four three other fellowships or two other fellowships that are starting up now as a real godly biblical church there's a church like this but and it's anticipable some of them have pastors and some of them don't have pastors yet so but they are they have a vision and there might only be eight of them but they've got a vision and they they they know what's right and so it's just starting and these people are not in it for the money these people are in it because of the heart of God and so please pray that the Lord just keep praying that the Lord will just develop these people and keep them safe because yeah you know it's not easy it's not easy at all and yeah praise the Lord I'll leave it there you can read the beer now [Applause] hey man cover brother Andy we've missed you welcome back miss your worship and your

remember it's a library and it's not a playground so let's keep all the children then let's have lunch and you know but it's a library's list look after the place accordingly amen let's um let's go to Genesis chapter 35 we'll read here a couple of scriptures that Jesus is thirty five and three and five I mean three to five sites is and then we're going to go to Genesis 41 says now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his breather and they hated him and they could not speak peaceably unto him and Joseph dreamed a dream and told it his brethren and they hated him yet more let's go to just go to the next Genesis 41 - really couple of scriptures here [Music] Genesis 41 and 45 and 46 it's very different place to Joseph finds himself in he sees and and Joseph this is after Joseph is he's come out of prison he's told Farah what his dreams are now he's been elevated to the right hand of Pharaoh it's in pharaoh called joseph named sabbath na punya have you pronounced that which means revealer of secret things and he gave him to wife s Nia the daughter of Potiphar priest of odd and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt Amen let's just bow heads and a word of Prayer gracious father we're so thankful we are happy glad and free Lord there is none like thee Lord there you are the fairest of ten thousand to our soul Lord we thank you you have redeemed us we think you were a free people we thank your Lord the devil has been exposed and cast down thank your father for your blood that you shed on the cross to set us free we thank you Lord we see the victory that you won that day is living out in our lives by your grace that's being done and father we asking as we Lord we have opened the pages of your word and Lord we know anyone can that can read can read it but Lord you are the great author and father Lord what is it good what good is it having just a dead leader without you manifesting it and anointing it dear God so father may you take your wood and make it live in every soul this morning father may you anoint each one Lord may take the service under your control and we just want to commit our lives into your hands we we thank you for this opportunity to worship you and we want to commit it into your hands will be with those who couldn't be here today as well be their portion father and we just want to commit our lives into your hands laughers without you we can do nothing so father may you come and Lord live for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen I mean god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to so we're going through the later see in church agent and last Sunday we were talking about how society is changing and it's so much compared to what it once was and and you know a families are broken up the nation's broken up you know there's you know those world is falling apart but we know God is in control of everything and and he has restored us back to an original faith or the original faith and but I want to just kind of change I'm going to continue into what I was talking about last Sunday but I'm gonna talk about Joseph a little bit today the Sunday maybe go back to it Nick Sunday all right so Joseph we see as a Joseph as a perfect type of Christ as we read therein in Genesis 37 he was loved of his father he was head of his brethren he was spiritual you know he had dreams they and they came to pass his his brethren hated him you know without a cause it seems you know he's given a coat of many colors which is a covenant coat he had the Covenant just like Jesus is the catio he is you know here's the covenant you know between God and man he was hated by his brethren without a cause all he did was heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils do good you know open the people's eyes to you know what you know more than just religion but a true and living God because he was God made flesh and but they hated him they wanted nothing to do with them because they wanted to keep the just Indian religion and so he was hated without a cause then he was sold like a Judas sold Jesus for thirty pieces of silver Joseph was sold for about twenty pieces of silver it was a price of a slave in those days and so did he wait down into Egypt and God caused him to to go down there because in your famine would come and life had to be preserved and so while he was down in Egypt he was he was eventually cast into prison just like Jesus was on the cross you could say his prison one thief was saved the other one was lost it was there was the butler and the Baker one was your the Baker died and the butler was restored he was saved and then after that Joseph was you know after that Joseph now Pharaoh had a dream any any and none of his wise men could could answer that dream so then the butler remembered oh there's a Hebrew in prison and he told me what my dream would be and what the Baker's dream would be and it came to pass exactly the interpretation of it and so he remembered it and he says to Pharaoh Pharaoh there was a man in prison he told me my dream I'm sure he could tell you yours and so joseph has now taken from prison and he's come up before Pharaoh Pharaoh explains his dream of the you know seeing seeing the seven fat cows and a meadow then seven think cows come and they eat up the fat cows but they stay thin and in this seven big fat sheaves of corn in seven withered ones I've come up and devoured the fat ones but they say wizard and he says the interpretation is you have seven years of plenty than seven years of famine and so and then and then because Pharaoh can see that that bet the Spirit of God has and Joseph he he gets him to be in charge of of storing up all the food for the time of famine and so he has exalted now from being in present to the right hand of our Pharaoh no one was above Pharaoh I mean you know Joseph was second-in-command in all of Egypt and when and when Joseph went somewhere the Trumbull will blow every knee had to bow because Joseph was coming same thing with our Lord now he said their right hand the Majesty on high or power and heaven earth was given to him and then now here he is but now during this time when he's in this Gentile and he takes a Gentile bride and all Christ types in the Bible take a Gentile bride Moses took a Gentile bride Boaz took a Gentile bride Salman took a Gentile bride right and so these ones all took Gentile prize because God was showing in these stories as a pattern as after the Jews reject him then he takes a Gentile bride that's what's been going on for seven church ages was there as a rejection off of their Messiah and it had to be done that way because even when Jacob came to bless Josef's two sons Joseph places all the senators right at Jacob's right hand to receive the main blessing but the in answer is going to bless them God cross his hands and Joseph was angry at him saying what are you doing you're putting the main bliss the younger son but then Jacob says I know but God crossed my hands and God has shown through the cross that the blessing would come to the Gentile to the younger who shouldn't have received it instead of going to the Jew hallelujah so all the life all the lives of the believers you read through the Bible God is manifesting himself God is manifesting his life he's showing this character is showing us nature amen he's showing himself all through these Bible stories and so now there is a so he takes as we read there he takes a Gentile bride while he's in Egypt and then now when the famine strikes when the famine strikes then of course his brothers have to go get grain everybody knows the story I trust you do and there comes a point where God as Joseph test as brothers to see if they've changed and they had changed and so now becomes a point where he where where he sends all men from him and then he reveals himself to his brethren so instead of speaking through an interpreter to speak to them he begins to speak their mother tongue and they're astonished told us this one who's dressed up like a Gentile who looks like a Gentile but he's speaking our language and he and he begins to say I'm your I'm your brother Joseph that you sold into slavery but now when he reveals himself to his brethren everyone's from him his bride is in the palace his bride is not there because she isn't his Gentile wife is in the palace when he reveals himself to his brethren and that is showing to us that when we're in glory we're in glory first then he reveals himself to the 144,000 Alleluia so now we're in the space of time now because because the life of Joseph encompasses the first and second coming of Christ it's all in that story so we're living in the in the between time you say well that's where we are now Romans 11:25 for I would not brethren that you be ignorant of this mystery that you should be wise in your own conceits that the blindness and the part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in so so they'll come a time when the fullness of the Gentiles God knows how many of you'll be there God knows the number when that fullness comes in when they really come into Christ not just come to the message but come to the God that set the message right there's more than learning of doctrine and conformity do some man's idea but God comes and lives in them just like brother ND was saying 20 there you're their brother was twenty years twenty years trying to say the right thing and conform and try and please these people from overseas doesn't do them any good just a dead we're religion I mean but their God got us too quick in the word to you right it has to be alive this message is living I mean it's a it has its own life we don't need to worry about how it's all going to work out God puts it in the predestinated hand and got quickens that word to that person God does the work I've seen it in Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea you know I've seen it I've seen it in this country your God knows how to get his word to his children right it has a life but you've got to let it live if you don't let it live you just getting in the way right so until the fullest it Gentiles comes in now this is um we're part of that hallelujah see if on all right this morning amen let's just blow the devil away right what why should we put up why she had to put up with you know the devil doesn't want you to fulfill the word he doesn't want you to fulfill the word he'll he'll allow you to be religious he'll that you even say you have a testimony you say you know to to say yes I remember scripture and whatever more but he but he doesn't want you to live it and the world is full of people arguing about scripture but what about the life what about it manifesting and a people that's why the devil always just like baptism brother Alba your Christine's then knew that the his first baptism and the titles of God was wrong then he was going this battle because he knew the baptism name of Jesus Christ is right then he realized what's stopping me from fulfilling the word there was the devil stopping him so he kicked it to one side he got baptized it's really that simple I mean so we shouldn't just you know we God wants to see his word lifts the devil doesn't want God to live in people I mean that is yeah you know I'm sure you should say well that's pretty obvious but sometimes we're gonna think about it the devil doesn't want God to live in me he doesn't want God to manifest through me I mean and when someone when a the difference between you know and you know the reason I'm bringing out about Joseph's wife is because the wife is very different to a girlfriend or a fiance I mean because a wife now can legally be a child can actually produce a life in the image of the husband right and it's very different out here she is being married to Joseph and she has his she has a sons and those sons are made in His image hallelujah and it's going to be the same thing with us when we're really united with him we don't just talk about it it lives right there produces the image of the son hallelujah are you following me Christianity is a living thing this message is living is not a dead religion it's not a bunch of reasoning right hallelujah this word lives in every generation there's been a people that the word is manifested through right and you're going to say Lord make me one of them doesn't matter what people say about me or whatever God manifests through me right and if there's something that takes that sweetness out of your life you got to say God restore the joy we're still that sweetness we shouldn't have walls up and shields against each other in the word and who are we fighting we're fighting the devil not one another without fighting our Lord hallelujah Amen so we don't just want to sit back you know I want God to live not for my glory someone wants to taste the money for their own glory is too puffed up shed and God will put them to one side right we want to see God manifests in everyday life not just here in these four walls oh we go to church and God lives what about in your house God come down in your house I pray does he should do a lujah so now she she had his children they were made in His image she didn't just have gifts she had the life amen gifts are good God is a God of addition he doesn't subtract I will restore say at the Lord all the years the palm woman that came to him the locust the caterpillar has eaten I will restore so I will restore those things I won't add one then take away one that have the next one take away the previous one I'm going to add the whole thing right so now we have the gifts and we have the giver right so we have the gifts just like a fiance gets gifts a girlfriend gets gifts but the wife gets married and she has the husband and the gifts amen exactly now we're in this time God is in control he knew where you were that's why I said there's a supernatural gospel right we're supernatural people there's a supernatural walk of faith it's not a natural look we walk by faith and not by sight I mean we walk by faith and not by sight right and when someone brings in a yea hath God really said you've got to look now where will that question take me where will it take me Eve didn't stop to think when the Serpent's ETA has God said she didn't think do you think this will take me out of Eden this will take me out of union with God this will take me into sin she didn't stop to think about that and you got to think about that when people say does it really mean this where will that take you right you always got to think about that where will it take you we want life right not just a nice religion not just nice families you know the promised land was more than milk and honey it was more than milk and honey the real spiritual believer you was more than a nice a nice place of milk and honey I mean it was a place of Resurrection that's why Joseph said when you leave take my bones bury me there Jacob told told his son son swear swear by him will you just promise to me you will not bury me here but you'll bury me right in the in the Promised Land because there's a resurrection in that place that's why the spiritual ones knew they had to be in that place right and it's the same thing this message will give us good families it will give us good children it will give us good Church right it will give us good people but it's more than that it's a place of resurrection there's a resurrection power just like this is why you know a psychologist worth half of this you know anything decent he can see that the principles laid out in the scripture makes a good sound person but it's more than just being good sound person right hallelujah I want a place don't bury me in some religion bury me in Christ hallelujah because if I'm in him I'll come forth but if I'm in some religion old I'll say did Amen that's why we're going to be more than quotas right because remember on the day you know I just been listening to brother BAM up in heaven a Jubilee preach y'all the restoration of the Brad tree and he says when the day of Pentecost was fully come it wasn't a priest coming into the Upper Room you know it wasn't coming off some local church it came from heaven there's a sound came from heaven I wasn't a priest coming into the room saying you know have the wafer and do this and whatever more put your name on the book shake the pastor's hand it wasn't that it was God coming down hallelujah was the presence of God coming and dwelling and his people and it has to be the same if he is the same yesterday today and forever that same thing should happen to you right and brother Graham says I think it's a visible union he says that you know the modern church does not want screaming shouting boohoo crying at a time speaking acts 2:38 young uns miserable creatures she thinks they are but they glorious so does that mean well that means the church doesn't want people to get next to themselves maybe actually breakthrough once in a while and have a rejoicing time amen we have something very precious that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full so he's saying here that life he's not talking about just a religion the life that was that life they said they've handled the word of life that's a person right it's not just a bunch of leaders on a you know an argument on a bit of paper it's a person for that life was manifest that we have seen it and be a witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now how do you be a witness of something really you have to experience it you have to be there right you have to personally be part of the part of the scene not just a bystander a bystander can get all confused but someone who was there and it happened to them right John was not saying well this is just something that happened this happened to me and that's how you can be a witnesses of that life when his life comes into your manifest then you are a real witness that's the only way you can be a true witness that Jesus lives because it happened to you you're resurrected from the dead you was dead in trespasses and sins now he's quick and you made you alive hallelujah just like the of Joseph well how do I know you're married to him look at one's the ring and one's the life once the child looks just like him I meant that's why I want to emphasize it's very important he married a Gentile that Gentile produced his life upon the earth now we have to understand this is where we are I trust we know him say you know we will read that script you gotta say he's talking about me I'm amazed that I'm in the Bible even back in Genesis there I am hallelujah amen no first Peter why donate he says having not seen ye love and whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you so he says even though you don't see him you believe and what does it produce joy unspeakable and full of glory I mean that there's an actual it's it's not just saying we have joy and we don't have joy right that's like saying I've got a million dollars butter and have I actually don't have it but if I had it I would have it right and if you really got joy in the Holy Ghost you really have joy and you're really feeling it now we don't go by feelings you understand that it will whip us around but it should be a manifestation just like love if you really love someone but you don't feel it you don't really love them it's just lip service right but if you really say you love them you feel it amen and that's just natural love how much more just you know divine love but you see now we better see this is what the devil fights the devil fights against our joy he tries to take away our fellowship the first thing he does is he away the leaves of fellowship right so because you know how man is like a tree planted by the one river of I mean multiple rivers of one water samms one right he sees that bug you're the locust problem caterpillar whichever one I must go Rijal it's the four stages of the same bug chewing on the tree as the devil comes along but I'm saying it's like you're the you know you're the early book of X Church they're all rejoicing one mind one accord you know he says then this little bug just creeps along this little devil he starts chewing at the tree amen and what did you start to do first takes the joy away takes the fellowship away people don't fellowship anymore people run away and hide what's happening the Devils chewing the Devils chewing you know people can tell fellowship anymore caudillo and you have to get the really look at yourself and say no because the devil doesn't want you to be growing he doesn't want you to be a big strong tree planted by the rivers growing he doesn't want he wants you to be a little stump an effective little stump I mean so you gotta really identify now if something's actually in you saying I I just I can't handle the people I just got to stay away well what's happening we're really on home aren't we but we you know the devil tries to end it and in this what happens he comes in he causes clicks in the church over things that don't matter really and there's a separation what's happening the the bugs in he's chewing right but we've got a Holy Ghost repellent I mean we'll get a real bug spray and and and it should be in the plant right more than just a sprite it should be a life in the plot where the back tries that the devil tries to chew he just dies whatever crawls up and dies I mean because it's the piss poison I mean that that he can't take a loo here we don't don't need the devil steal your joy and the world can be upside down you can still be rejoicing Paul and Silas had had a wonderful time in a prison that just been beaten and they were put there in the inner prison hey man I don't know what that was singing but it was wonderful to god he was having a glorious time only very few of us have been in prison and I think any of us have been in prison for the word of God's sake he there in the firing line you know they're going forth they find themselves in that place they begin to pray and sing and rejoice oh yeah I mean don't let the devil get you down now searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified I didn't read the end of that receiving even the salvation of your souls verse 10 of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you these people you know believers in the Old Testament they were searching they were seeking when what we have received when would it come and they didn't live to see the day and here we are just enjoying the you know the wonderful season that we're in and they were Dylan they were diligent about it - I believe searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which is intended signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow and to whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they'd administer the things which are now reported unto you by them they have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into haloo yeah the things that they were you know they're administering it to us and we just receive it we're living in the greatest time I mean we're not living just in a you know we're not living under the blood of bulls and goats or even Matt Martin Luther's day wears these day early Pentecostal day we're living it when all of Jesus's made on we're living with the full word restored I mean a full Union hallelujah you know this is the greatest time to be alive I mean this is the greatest time to be alive I mean as a believer this is wonderful I mean where I can have you know where there's nothing between my soul and my Savior everything that they had in the early book of Acts Church we have hallelujah I mean we shouldn't have to you know you know you know we shouldn't have to read that and say well wonder what that's like we should say we know what that's like we can in fellowship together I mean because we know what it's like when he comes down like that when he changes us like that amen now I'm gonna jump ahead a bit because there's a restoration of the bride tree brother he speaks about a law a law that's in people now now we have a right to enforce that law and the lawgiver the Holy Spirit himself is here the agent of God to see that it's done that way I mean now the only way he could work is when you let him work see you've got to believe it there's a law oh if I ever get to my text now here's a law there's a law given amongst everything you know a fish has a law and that law and that fish can jump up here in water and here's a law within him if he will just let go of let go of that law that's in him he can sink plumb to the bottom of the sea won't bother him a bit won't break one cell you try to do it that law is not in you you can't do it but the fish can he defeats himself of it in such a way that he can there's nothing in him to burst open and he's made that way he knows it and he can enforce that law to make to take him plumb to the bottom of the sea then race him back up again oh there's a law in Christ that laws and man you can bury him to the deepest grave or or the deepest sea or the lowest hell there's a law of the spirit of god that'll raise him up again see a bird has a law now its body's material it's earthbound set on the earth here but it has a law within it that the way it spreads its wings it can fly plumb out of sight it's against science they claim its earthbound gravitation has to hold it there but it can defy gravitation lift itself right off of it and go right on out because it has to put that law that's in it to work and it's built to possess that law now I begin to feel religious now we have a law the law of life in us only no we don't only one thing you have to do you're made and born and placed in the body of Christ as sons and daughters of God you don't have to knock down to the devil you've got a law that's the law of the Holy Spirit the only thing you have to do is know how to let go and let God you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work when you let go and let God that's all see if the fish shed weight I'll catch my breath real good I'll breathe up a little oxygen on me and I'll see if I can go down no he does that he'll burst open sea and the bird says I'll see how fast I can run down here and maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down see he's got to know how to control know that law can't control him and the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and pull and hurry and off I don't get this of it I don't get that it's not a it's the know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and make God then he takes you to your healing takes you to the baptism of the Holy Spirit well anything he's promised any claim that he's given us yours and by letting go and letting God now if the officer was going to take the fellow that stole your property was going to take him to court and you keep pulling him back saying well I don't know just whether he should do this or not he will never get him there just let him go that's the way you do let Satan just let Satan just get away all the doubts and everything flee from your mind then God will raise you up amen it's like a bird saying I believe I can fly but they don't actually let go and just let it happen I mean and the proof they can do it as they fly right the proof of fish can swim down to the dips as they do it and they just do it naturally because it's part of the makeup that law is worth in their brother where I'm saying right but a same thing with a born-again believer now they have a law of life in them right they're happy the law of eternal life in them hallelujah that it doesn't matter you know what happens to this it'll be risen again but that life also has healing in it it has Redemption it has your restoration you know how it's like is us doing that last Sunday the head of the houses is the husband right and they man got sorry the devil has broken fatherhood has broken motherhood and now children don't know how do you know they don't know how to your children growing up these days cannot emotionally develop the right way because they have no relationship with parents right but now and the problem is as you know I was reading this thing on seeing in a few weeks ago this persons put out this you know child psychology thing they're saying now we have to change it used to be in the urine history yet he always knows beasts but now we've changed from that to daddy doesn't always know beasts now if you teach that to children then they will because what happens as a child how they relate to their father is how they'll relate to God subconsciously so if the father is distant and mean and never being policed by anything the child us then the child will begin to think God is distant and mean and I can never please them right so if you're teaching the children that daddy doesn't always know best then that we're going to think God doesn't always know best and I'll do my own thing yet being religious right we can't have that kind of mentality God is always right he is always always 100 percent of the time in every condition every circumstance no matter how you cut it slice whatever look at the argument God is always right daddy always knows best God is our daddy right I mean so now the we so the thing is now with a husband Jesus Christ as the husband of the church right so now he manifested Redemption to his family right he redeemed us just like Joseph and and redemption is through marriage right by our union with Christ we are redeemed he preaches our salvation and that redemption is manifested in a union right because he died to cleanse us of our sins wash your lessons away make us new creatures and we become one oh yeah right so now Joseph now by marrying you taking a Gentile bride now you'd say was redeeming her out of Egypt that she was no longer the daughter of a priest but she became the wife of Joseph hallelujah her identity changed by the Union okay so in a way Joseph was manifesting Redemption to his wife taking her from Egypt and now sheis she was him what because they became one now that is true is it not especially with Jesus redeeming us so redemption was manifested through the husband okay now that should be the same thing with us right that redemption should be manifested through us to our children okay are you following me so when they're all scattered and wherever and if we have been redeemed by him yeah the law of life comes in to us right so that same life that was in him as now on us so what he did we do not now I'm not talking about shedding our blood for salvation that's not talked about the attributes that were in him are in us right that's what the last thing that Adam did is his position as God in the earth was he tried to redeem his wife by falling with her that was his last act as God over this earth but then his first act as a fallen man as he passes the buck God the woman you gave me cause me to do this God it's actually your fault there's no one else around here right so that was his that was now fallen man manifesting passing the buck but God God takes responsibility of his children I mean that's why Jesus God became a man the son of God he became flesh you know I'm gonna take responsibility I'm gonna it's not just gonna be words of a prophecy that I'll come and redeem I'm gonna do it so he came he took responsibility over his household gathered them to himself hallelujah redeemed them amen gave them a new identity in him oh yeah right took responsibility and now that's that's been gunned down 37 church changes God takes responsibility of his children right and so now as men we must take responsibility of our own house and the life of God should manifest through us that redemption could happen for our children for our family right program says about applying the token you created that token creates an atmosphere around you it's the same thing with sisters as well but you see God has manifested through the man you know different to through the woman now you understand what I mean but this is this should be if there is redemption if we have been redeemed just like as ministers if we have been redeemed the in redemption should be manifested in the people we talk to right because it's in us if it's not in us then they cannot really become one with him they'll just become religious people right and so now if we've been redeemed then that will begin to affect their family I mean but you see you've got to let go let God he says yeah yes oh brother since that token the Holy Ghost the life of God in the person creates an atmosphere around them he says it you just that's just got a your family is just going to come under the influence of it that's why it's so important I'm so glad we can don't don't don't look at me like how's this going to happen let go and let God make God manifest let him have his way in your life that's what you got to do then try and work it out you say God take this thing get me out of the way come dwell live Alleluia you going to give yourself you have to feed on the right things right your to feed all the right things talk about the right things a mint doesn't mean you can yo you should talk about natural things but you know what's the what's the theme of your family what's the theme if there was the theme of your family what would it be is it is it my cultures that were on from is that my natural lineage or is it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we live for him because we love Him because he's wonderful I mean I believe we can have a meaning in our homes I believe we can have an atmosphere we walk through the door oh we're in paradise hallelujah I believe we can have it that way I mean hey if the devil could make his hell out here in different places we could have heaven so there's a law the law of eternal life has got to be in you right you can't just talk about it it's good in you I said about a bird they just fly you know I've never seen like a bird just kind of work it out first when they become fully grown they just flapping they're off right because they know it works hallelujah and we have to have the same I trust not in here but in here this thing works it produces what it says what Jesus said the word will produce it will produce it amen it says let every seed bring forth after its kind in Genesis 1 right and so now if that word is in the right ground it will produce what does in the in the seat now you mean I'm glad to stay away now I won't be too much longer but we can't we can't become cold this world is a cold world it's a it's a very dark it is a dark world whether we like it in this first world people are you know they doubt in their you know indifferent about many things we can't become like that it's not our portion it's not the apportion - you know that's living below privilege and we shouldn't just put up with well this is just how life is you know going to be we should you know we have to go back to our first love if we've lost it right okay just cool off and I'm glad that there's a power in this word that we do not call off I mean that he should mean more to you you know you have to really when when when your walk is becoming cold then you've got to look now well what has changed what has changed in me because the devil will batter in here any any any will try and knock us off the road right and then but then we have to because it's like Joshua was told meditate upon the whole word and you'll be successful so don't major on this and minor on this but take the whole Word of God right and you'll be successful and then Moses said you shall not diminish you you shall not take court of the word right let's just go to Deuteronomy judo chop before there's a reason I'm saying these things because we have to keep her we have to keep a balance and everything right so humanly well let's just read this you'd already for and one so I don't have this on the overhead he says now therefore hearken o Israel on to the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your father's giveth you ye shall not add unto the word which I commanded you neither shall you diminish aught from it that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I commanded you now would diminish the the definition it means to to scrape off by implication to shave remove listen withhold to take away keep back restrained make small withdraw so it's like just to scrape it off like you take a piece of toast and it's and it's been in the taste of too long you're scraping off so whoever you scrape off some of the cabin you have diminished that toast you have taken away from but just by a little bit you have diminished that toast we don't want to diminish the Word of God right we don't want to diminish the Word of God we're you know we're we listen some things and major on some things and vice versa and the reason I say that is because what happens is we're walking with the Lord then the enemy comes in and humanly humanly we will pull the other way if you were done that someone comes against you or something humanly you're on the other side and you take up your position and then now you'll find there on one side of the road and now you're on the other side of the road you're not in the middle anymore you've been pushed to one side right and then now if you go too far one way now you're in a ditch and they're on the other ditch and you say well they're wrong over there but what about what's affecting you now what's the feet thing you know because if you don't keep it under prayer and actually forgive and give it over to the Lord actually let go of it I mean real forgiveness is when you surrender the right to hold it against that person that's actually forgiving them right but if you don't actually figure in that way you're still holding on to it and they've given me this and now it's pulling me this way and then you end up in the ditch and then if you stay there now you dig then you have a trench and then you can build a bunker and then Here I am in my position but I'm not walking right and now what is the I need so so what happens to someone who lives in a bunker they don't see much sunlight they stay in their little bunkers aren't very big I went into the soso Papua New Guinea we are in rebels where the Japanese had their headquarters one of the main headquarters for the for the Pacific Theater for world war ii and i was an admiral yamamoto who's in charge of the invasion i was in his bunker and it was maybe not even the this big it was two rooms this is the Admirals bunker who's in charge of the invasion of the South Pacific it's a small place it's dingy wouldn't have been much nicer winner was actually operating and so people get used to their little four walls and this is you know because they're in there banker and you can see it in people but someone who's walking on the road you're enjoying the sunshine they're seeing new sights right the scenery changes when you walk right so then you see now there's a mountain here now there's a plane now there's this and this and you know and you can have fellowship as you walk look at this isn't this amazing isn't this wonderful and you walk through here and it's glorious and you walk through here and it's glorious and then you see how it ties back into here and it's glorious and you see him reflecting himself through the word all the Sun shines wonderful but someone's in a bunker they don't see sunshine if they pop out of their bunker they may get shot by who-knows-who but they there and it could happen and they become all cold hard and defensive because whatever affected them to build that bunker has caused them to build the bunker right we can't and that's why I say you got to look at yourself now we should still have joy we should still rich it like genuinely rejoice it's not a put-on but Oh Lord I'm so glad I'm so glad you died for me I'm so glad you paid my redemption in full I'm so glad that your spirit comes into me I mean I'm not under the law but I'm under you I'm in this rural Liberty and you I mean I don't have to conform to anything but it's you changing me hallelujah when you say Lord help me change me he says yes I'll do it for you amen hallelujah you don't have to push yourself through and truck he just doesn't you say I believe I'm free and you're free I believe that addictions God and it's gone hallelujah manifests a man and it gets sweeter and sweeter every day hallelujah gets more glorious all the time that's how it should be shouldn't it be that way and you're glad he means more for me I'm just gonna wrap up with this you know love should increase I mean we should love our spouses more now than when we first married them I mean we should love them so much more hallelujah sorry such a deeper richer more wonderful relationship how you been through some battles you been through some trials you've been through some dark places but you're still there and you still love each other I mean I trust you do and if you don't you say well go back to when you first fell in love yeah amen you can't go back to that time if you let yourself if you actually surrender the right to hold it against them you can't go back amen and so it should be the same with the Lord all we've been through some wonderful things we're been through some trials holy you mean so much more to me now that you first time you first met me I mean you're so much greater you saw your mercy so much were wonderful I mean your pieces are great huh yeah you know it should be that shouldn't be that way all wonderful wonderful Jesus is to me counsel the Prince of Peace the mighty God is he saving me keeping I'm so glad he keeps the study from Wilson in shame wonderful is my Redeemer praise His name oh yeah it should be that way I mean it shouldn't be well he's alright it's ok this is what I do this has become a habit this is why I do it it's my routine I don't change it's just how it is he's not wonderful in that way if you're stuck in this is just a routine you know sometimes they start you you know sometimes you just gotta plow through but it shouldn't always be that way you know why do you do this you know why are you here I've been here for a long time I've been here 40 years praise the Lord my chest is not because the only reason you've been here 40 years is because you're here 39 years beforehand what should be a bursting of a life hallelujah I know people in their eighties and they're rejoicing I mean they're so glad partly they praise them every day doesn't matter about their bodies falling apart they say glory to God hallelujah I say if I had you know if I ever get to that agent if I have half the joy I'll be happy here even even I know people like that endless message now amen in there and they've had hard lives they've had very hard lives and they're rejoicing I mean they didn't have it easy and yet they're rejoicing way happier than people who who seem to have it easier amen that's why we're going to go back and say Lord you're wonderful I remember that day you gotta let that look that's how you let them go that's how you let go and let God because if you if you lose your confidence in him then because you know if you lose your confidence at home within you'll had the book confidence in yourself because who asked can you trust and then how you try and do it and where's that gonna lead you right but then if you go back and remember everything he's done for you that's why you got to go back even just the fact God called you and went beyond just in here something in here spoke that's supernatural God you called me you called me one day I want to do everything else but yet you called me I love you for that Lord thank you for the call thank you Lord you caught me and I've come and I want to serve you I want you to change me O Lord and you came and I had you changed me and I said I gave my whole life and you changed my heart you changed my nature and I'm a different person from that day to this day hallelujah and I'll be walking with you and the scenery just gets better hallelujah this means more to me friend I'm hey I get emotional world tough I'm glad I'm not dead anything without emotion is dead I did religion has no emotion you don't want to be dead oh yeah you should have you know I think was a Keith Green he said yeah you know you're the brother who wrote Lord your book Oh Lord you're beautiful your face is all I sick he says I won't ever heart that's so tender it's like baby skin after that you know that stance quoting doesn't we get Callison you know how do you must be tender hallelujah and that's the real challenge now can you continue walking with him and remain tender in spite of all the trials and the hardship and the whatever the devil fires against you pick up that shield of faith to quench the fire that's the enemy have in your faith will quench the doubts doesn't matter where they come from amen this word is true this whole word is true hallelujah I may not be able to understand it all but it's true I made the author he's good as his letters hallelujah I mean my husband is wonderful he's never let me down he knows what's best for me he's guided me through he stayed close I mean even when I may not remain faithful he remains faithful as his word says he is always faithful and true you're the first thing I I know you're I remember reading in your was a revelations 19 he's called faithful and true said Lord you're faithful and true doesn't matter you know I'm me but you're faithful and true you've got to keep your eyes on him don't take your eyes on to other things what normally happens sometimes you get married and then your eyes are on each other and it's lovely it's the gloriously and then but then now life happens and then what happens when your eyes go on to life and then what happens those things can bog you down right but if you keep your eyes on each other then you remain strong and you go back in the X remember you know you know I'll probably say to every service the devil is a historian he's not a good one cuz he only lead he weighs leave the other part where you get set free and he and he got kicked out but gods are historian - not in all the bad things that you've done but he remembers the day hey when when he went up Calvary you were on his mind your honors mine he knew what he was going there the joy that was set before him I mean now that's just not some vague thing to him are these a joy I'll have a bride I don't know who she is it's got to be wonderful that wasn't him he knew he saw his bride redeemed robed in his righteousness hallelujah gathered around the throne there was the joy a redeemed people a cleanse people a wash people and he saw you there if you believe you're part of that blood he saw you there he saw you there and he said I've got I must go for those ones those specific ones hallelujah hallelujah amen that wasn't a vague think that he knew you'd be there right and so now he takes us through me anything so he's a historian he remembers that day and he also knew when you would actually meet him amen who's ever been in a long-distance relationship before hello yeah you know you're right back and forward or call or whatever more you should take out she is in the telecommunications company because you have such a big bill right but there comes a time when that day is gone and you're you're in each other's presence and those days are just a happy memory but now you're not just long-distance anymore you're together and to me that's like God he knew when you would be here and these are isn't it anticipation I'm going to see them I'm excited so many days if I save up this much money I live on tomato sauce on toast I'll be able to buy me a ticket here we go Oh anyway yeah you appreciate nicer things anyway but then you're under expectation because you see the day's approaching you think we're excited he's excited he's been waiting for you to come to the earth hallelujah he's been waiting for you maybe 2019 doesn't matter when it was he was waiting thousands of years oh ho I'm so excited I'm gonna meet her I'm gonna meet him we're gonna become one holy we have a glorious relationship it's going to be full of love and joy and peace wonderful experiences even through valleys and rivers over mountains wherever it may be it's going to be glorious we're gonna write a wonderful history together hallelujah how God's not a robot our God is alive you know you know I think round the throat I don't know how yo-yo often think Lord how are you gonna be that day when we're around the throne you know cuz I think he's just gonna stand there and do the rule you know I think he's gonna be the most excited one of us all I think so because finally his Redemption and he knows what's going to happen and finally it's happened holy you're finally it's all bad I love those words the book of Revelation it is done hallelujah it is done hallelujah I like those words because one day it's really gonna be done hallelujah hey we're gonna be excited I think he's going to be excited he's my redeem ones I walked with him in the earth they were faithful to me they surrender they're all they didn't hold anything back in spite of whatever the pressure of the H was they overcame their pressure cuz of their divine love for me hallelujah they forsook all they followed me Amy do you think you'd be he's gonna be happy he's gonna be rejoicing I mean when we sing the songs of Zion that day hallelujah I don't think he's going to be you're well done it was fun he's gonna be excited now God's not a robot maybe I'm being a bit dramatic but I want you to see he's not an impersonal God someplace amen he wants he wants to walk with us don't hide in a bunker of religion or pain they're full of spiders and they're cold it's not nice there's no sunshine in a bunker bunker doesn't really have obvious expose points right because if there's an expose point someone can get a shot at or or fire a bomb on or missile whatever they are sealed as possible don't hide in what you're used to if you're in a bunker get out of the bunker get back on the road why am I in this place I should be you shouldn't be in that place Jesus didn't die for us to make religious bunkers he died that we would walk with him up into glory hallelujah so you gotta think now why am I in this way what happened will that happen all that happened no it should be yes but Lord you brought healing into my life and it's gone shouldn't it be that way Moses brings it up and I'll close with this Moses brings the children israel like they come through the Red Sea mighty victory then they're walking three days they have no water they come to a place where the waters bitter they come to a bitter experience in their walk we all have come to those waters of marrow of bitterness and thence they came to this place it would trees growing around the water I don't know how big the tree was that Moses cut down but God told them that tree cut it down there's specific tree cut it down put that tree in the water it became sweet now what does that represent take the cross take redemption take what he's done for you right take redemption it's been cut down mix it into the experience right amen and it will make it sweet it won't be a bitter memory anymore oh yeah you got to do it you say well there's been massive things happen to me there's nothing too big that cannot be made sweet well why did it happen to me I don't know the woman at the well had to be at the well she had to be in that condition to meet the Lord right the maniac in the tombs whatever caused him to open a door one spirit an expert an expert in up in the tombs I don't know but he had to be there he had to be there Mary Magdalene had had to have seven devil she had to be in that condition I don't know why it doesn't seem to make sense but God is showing it doesn't matter what condition you come to me in right it doesn't matter what condition you may be in I mean Paul was a Pharisee of the Pharisees and that's even a worse a condition because it's it's religious but yet God made him hallelujah and then now he could relate to the religious ones he knew how to speak to them the world well could speak to those who came from broken homes broken relationships she could relate right she could relate and so we have to God uses those things God uses those things brother Graham said you know Sharon Rose died her on her her eyes crossed and pain and then he said after that cross our children will come across the platform they would never leave with cross-ice because he could relate because he had been here and had her own child suffering so he could enter into that burden God wants to manifest himself through us if you haven't really caught up with the program that's what he wants to do but if we're cold and callous and indifferent if we can't relate to the person you can't enter into their burden we're not meant to just say a prayer we're mean to pray a prayer and when we're really prayer prayer it's not you praying it's him right that's how it should be and he said not one child left with cross eyes because of that experience Amen God could use it to help others right and it has to be the same thing with us you say well I've been through some terrible things God can use that amen and God wants to use it but get out of your bunker is the cross mix it with the bitter water mix it with that bitter memory do it what do you do do it don't you say that's a nice idea one day no take it makes it drink it and become sweet get out of your bunker walk along the Kings Highway hallelujah I mean let's have the musicians please that's close they're my friends we wanna have some joy God well it doesn't matter where you've come from what situation you say well you know let God use it let go and let God I mean let's sing that song let's sing that
