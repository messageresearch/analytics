[24:46] um so I'm going to sing a song which was
[24:49] written by a friend who lives in the
[24:51] states um the inspiration for the song
[24:54] comes from when Jesus is preaching um
[24:58] about unless you eat my flesh and drink
[25:01] of my blood you have no part in me and
[25:04] most of his disciples from that time
[25:07] went back and they walked no more with
[25:08] him and then Jesus said unto the 12 will
[25:11] you also go away and then Simon Peter
[25:13] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[25:16] thou Hast the words of eternal life and
[25:18] we believe and are sure that thou art
[25:20] the Christ the son of the Living God
[25:22] from John 6 um I'm trying to work on
[25:26] when things seem impossible to just just
[25:28] keep trusting in the word of
[25:44] God to whom shall we
[25:50] go if you have the words of
[25:55] life and where can I run

[26:06] run to whom shall we
[26:12] go if you have the words of
[26:17] life and where can I
[26:22] run there's nowhere to run
[26:29] I could run to my own
[26:33] understanding I could trust what I feel
[26:37] or what I see but my heart fails
[26:43] me my heart fails
[26:49] me I could run to my own
[26:54] understanding I could trust what I feel
[26:57] or what what I see but my heart fails

[41:01] go to the scripture uh uh this morning
[41:03] we're going to go to first uh
[41:04] Corinthians chapter 10:
[41:06] 13 amen so praise the
[41:09] Lord amen let's just read this here just
[41:13] one um we got two two verses to read one
[41:17] here and then ver and then John 10 and10
[41:19] so it's interesting how the songs will
[41:21] line up I like how God orchestrates
[41:24] things don't you I'm because I'm going
[41:26] to talk about way of Escape
[41:27] today there's always a way of Escape if
[41:30] that's all you get out of the service
[41:31] that's all you need to get out there's
[41:32] always a way out of Escape of out of
[41:33] every Temptation every trial every trap
[41:36] of the devil there's always a way of
[41:38] Escape amen amen so let's read this
[41:40] together there hath no temptation taken
[41:42] you but such as is common to man but God
[41:45] is faithful who will not suffer you to
[41:47] be tempted above that ye are able but
[41:50] will with the Temptation also make a way
[41:52] of escape to escape that ye may be able
[41:55] to bear it so remember if there's
[41:58] Temptation there's a way of Escape they
[42:00] always go together there's never the
[42:01] Temptation without a way of Escape okay
[42:04] amen then um John 10 and 10 in a a
[42:06] familiar uh scripture here the Lord
[42:09] Jesus speaking says um the thief cometh
[42:13] not but to steal and to kill and to
[42:18] destroy that's what he comes to do trap
[42:21] you think there's no way out it's
[42:23] hopeless but I am come that you may have
[42:25] life and you may have it more abundantly
[42:29] amen praise the Lord so let's bow our
[42:30] heads in a word of prayer this morning
[42:32] if you have a need just want to raise
[42:33] your hand to the Lord say Lord come by
[42:34] my way today amen let's pray amen
[42:37] almighty God we thank you so much we can
[42:39] bow our heads and hearts in your
[42:41] presence Lord we're so thankful that
[42:43] Lord there's nothing Lord formed that
[42:45] can prosper against us Lord you're the
[42:46] greatest one Lord you conquered how
[42:48] death in the grave we're so thankful we
[42:50] Face a conquered into me this morning
[42:52] Lord CU you are still Victorious this
[42:54] day and I pray father as we've read your
[42:55] word I ask Lord you anointed to speaker
[42:58] and hearer Lord may you take control
[42:59] Lord I want to get myself out of the way
[43:01] that you can do what you want to do so
[43:03] Lord may you have your free course this
[43:04] day father may you be lifted up and
[43:06] glorified in our midst father we love
[43:08] you Lord we ask your blood would cover
[43:10] us all Lord Jesus may protect us Lord
[43:12] may you have preeminence in our lives
[43:14] those who aren't here today dear God be
[43:16] their abundant portion as well Lord in
[43:18] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[43:21] you friends you can have your seats um
[43:23] this morning so I want to talk about God
[43:26] or always has a way of Escape amen so we
[43:30] live in a day where the devil is uh has
[43:32] many traps and tricks and everything and
[43:34] and we know the devil's uh uh scheme or
[43:37] plan is always is always to make us
[43:39] think that there's never a way out amen
[43:42] but but it doesn't matter what comes
[43:44] your way what Temptation comes your way
[43:46] there is always a way of Escape amen
[43:49] because we know hopelessness doesn't
[43:50] come from God that's from Satan he wants
[43:52] you to feel hopeless he wants you to
[43:54] feel that life is too overwhelming you
[43:56] can't get through this no answer there's
[43:58] always an answer amen and our Lord Jesus
[44:00] Christ is that answer so as as the Lord
[44:03] has come to give a way of Escape so the
[44:05] devil we know his job is to steal kill
[44:08] and to destroy he wants to take your
[44:10] life captive amen but our God is here to
[44:12] deliver amen set us free to walk with
[44:14] him in his word now brother BR makes a
[44:17] statement he says and make your way he
[44:18] says sickness pins you into a corner
[44:20] Satan pins you down to a place where you
[44:22] um after you become a Christian maybe
[44:24] you've been a gambler you see it the
[44:25] cards are on the table come on John you
[44:27] know it's in you Satan's there to tempt
[44:29] you but God is in every time we'll make
[44:31] a way of Escape if you'll just accept it
[44:34] so there's a principle God always makes
[44:36] a way of Escape but you've got to choose
[44:38] to walk out of it like so for example if
[44:40] there's a fire in this building there's
[44:41] a fire exit it's you know they've been
[44:44] labeled you know which way of escape to
[44:46] take you've got to get out of your seat
[44:47] and go out right if you don't well
[44:50] there's no there wasn't anything wrong
[44:51] with the way of Escape you just got to
[44:52] walk through it amen so you've got to
[44:54] choose to to to walk out of these things
[44:56] you've youve got to accept that way of
[44:58] Escape maybe you've been a drunker of
[44:59] glasses under your nose now come on John
[45:02] now if you want to heed to that voice
[45:03] you'll go right uh right out to your
[45:06] wallow again but God is always there
[45:08] turn your minds towards heaven and look
[45:10] towards Calvary and say blessed Holy
[45:12] Spirit come to me I'm a need watch what
[45:14] takes place God Will Make A Way of
[45:16] Escape every time for he will God has
[45:19] always did it amen so and every time
[45:21] there's always been a way of Escape I'm
[45:23] going to repeat this cuz I pray this
[45:24] would just anchor into our hearts
[45:26] because we got to realize through life's
[45:27] journey the devil's going to try and pin
[45:29] us on something he'll put us into some
[45:31] secret addiction where on the outside we
[45:33] look fine but on the inside what's going
[45:35] on I mean we're we're we're out
[45:37] outwardly we look like like Believers
[45:39] but inwardly we're entertaining his
[45:40] Spirit maybe pornography lust or
[45:43] whatever it is hatred malice Strife Envy
[45:45] whatever it is you know and and and but
[45:47] there's a way of Escape out of that and
[45:49] many times we think you know the devil
[45:51] wants us to say well you've gone too far
[45:52] you've been too long you've come back to
[45:54] it again there's no way out this time
[45:56] he's lying to you the devil's lying to
[45:59] you amen there's always a way of Escape
[46:01] amen if but you got to take it amen amen
[46:04] praise the Lord now we're going to
[46:05] realize our way of Escape isn't just an
[46:07] exit uh just an exit but but that exit
[46:10] has power in it to Deliver Us from these
[46:11] things so Moses Moses was commanded you
[46:14] know we know that when um um you know
[46:17] they came to the Red Sea they didn't
[46:18] come there haphazardly if you read the
[46:20] account God directed them right there
[46:22] and they come up to the Red Sea the um
[46:24] pharaoh and his armies behind and you
[46:26] know all of the all of the Israelites
[46:28] are panicking you know you you've
[46:30] brought us out here to die and this is
[46:32] the first thing that the devil wants to
[46:33] do is put fear Upon Our Lives who being
[46:35] trapped in this place or in trouble but
[46:37] they were walking right in the pathway
[46:39] that God had led them to walk and
[46:41] because you got to realize that God
[46:43] doesn't just want to deliver us he wants
[46:44] us to know that our enemy that's come
[46:47] against us is dead that it can't come
[46:48] and get you no more I mean so there one
[46:51] thing for Israel to come out of Egypt
[46:53] but it was another thing for them to
[46:54] come out and their pursuers that that
[46:56] they couldn't pursue them no more that
[46:58] their enemy was was dead that's why they
[47:00] came to the Red Sea cuz if you think
[47:01] about it if Israel just walked out of um
[47:04] um walked out of Egypt but the Egyptians
[47:07] weren't taken care of there would have
[47:08] been a fear they could come get us again
[47:11] they're still the superpower of the age
[47:12] sure God's done all these things but
[47:14] they could come and get us so God wants
[47:16] to eliminate that fear out of our Lives
[47:18] amen that he wants to kill that fear
[47:20] that that thing that once beat you and
[47:22] tore you down and made you a slave and
[47:24] that your cruel Taskmaster he wants you
[47:27] know that thing won't bother you no more
[47:29] amen so before the Red Sea ever parted
[47:31] before God ever gave the way of Escape
[47:33] we know Moses was looking for it because
[47:35] Moses was anointed not just to take them
[47:37] to the Red Sea not just to take them to
[47:39] SI but to take them into the promised
[47:41] land so he realized Lord my journey
[47:43] isn't done am mean my commission isn't
[47:46] completely fulfilled sure you've brought
[47:48] Israel out with a mighty hand but you're
[47:49] going to take them in am mean so he
[47:51] realized this obstacle had to move
[47:53] because this wasn't his End Amen and you
[47:55] got to realize friends we're got a
[47:57] Rapture to enjoy I we got a body change
[47:59] to happen to us amen this message came
[48:01] to transform your life amen that the
[48:03] Fulfillment the promise of all the ages
[48:05] the dead in Christ raising and the
[48:07] Believers being changed to meet the Lord
[48:09] in the air you're here to fulfill that
[48:11] that's your end destination so no that
[48:13] God will give a way of Escape that
[48:14] whatever's holding you won't hold you
[48:17] because that's your
[48:18] destination Hallelujah so so remember
[48:21] Moses prophesied to Israel before this
[48:24] ever happened these Egyptians you see
[48:26] today you'll see them no more forever
[48:28] this is the last time you see your
[48:30] oppressor this is the last time you see
[48:31] your accuser this is the last time you
[48:33] see your slave master he's going to
[48:35] drown Hallelujah we know the rest of the
[48:38] story God part of the Red Sea Hallelujah
[48:40] they walk through on dry ground the
[48:42] enemy tried to pursue see a way of
[48:44] Escape is Deliverance to you it's a trap
[48:46] for your devil a trap for the devil
[48:48] trying to destroy you amen so was a trap
[48:50] for pharaoh and his armies it was
[48:52] Deliverance for for for Israel amen and
[48:55] we know you know after crossed the Red
[48:57] Sea amen Moses raised his staff again
[48:59] and the waters came down and they
[49:01] drowned all the you know drowned all
[49:02] their um oppressors their slave masters
[49:04] were dead I mean that's why Miriam
[49:06] picked up a tambourine cuz she realized
[49:08] her way of Escape I mean it wasn't just
[49:10] for her to get out of Egypt was here to
[49:12] destroy her oppressor am mean they had a
[49:14] Pentecostal meeting on the bank there
[49:16] Hallelujah cuz they looked back and they
[49:17] saw their enemies amen drowned amen
[49:20] maybe Levi said to um B whoever they
[49:23] called you know look Simeon remember
[49:25] that guy that beat you the other day
[49:27] he's dead there amen that spirit that
[49:29] tormented you that family curse that was
[49:31] coming down is being drowned Hallelujah
[49:33] they could Rejoice amen it's the same
[49:35] thing brother Ram said that we can look
[49:37] into the blood of Jesus Christ after
[49:39] we've gone through the blood of Jesus
[49:40] Christ and those Spirits are dead amen
[49:43] those things are dead in the blood of
[49:44] Jesus Christ
[49:46] hallelujah amen so it's a Deliverance to
[49:50] one it's a destruction for another we're
[49:52] not here to drown
[49:53] friends we're here to be delivered we're
[49:55] here to walk free amen because God has
[49:58] given us a way of
[50:00] Escape
[50:02] amen you know we often think of Daniel
[50:04] in the Lion's Den just as Daniel going
[50:06] in the den but the the Lion's Den was
[50:10] Daniel's way of
[50:11] escape from his from his work colleagues
[50:15] we know there are people in the court
[50:16] there cuz Daniel was the principal you
[50:18] could say the prime minister or whatever
[50:19] he was called in that day there were
[50:21] other men in the in the cabinet that
[50:23] wanted him dead they hated him Without a
[50:25] Cause Daniel was just doing his job
[50:28] serving God serving the kingdom it was
[50:30] prospering all these things but these
[50:32] others were jealous these jealous
[50:34] Spirits wanted to kill Daniel so they
[50:35] had the king to make that law that no
[50:37] one could pray uh you know to to any
[50:40] other man or God but to the king because
[50:42] they used Daniel's Faith against
[50:45] himself but but the but that whole
[50:47] pressure came on it was actually a way
[50:49] of Escape many times we think just a
[50:51] trial is something we just got to endure
[50:53] and nothing's really going to come out
[50:55] of it apart from ourselves but but it's
[50:56] actually a way of Escape where things
[50:58] that once bothered and hounded you
[51:00] actually are done away with cuz can you
[51:03] imagine he had to every day he would go
[51:05] to work he had to be very careful how he
[51:07] spoke around these guys cuz they were
[51:09] looking for a way to get him they were
[51:11] looking for a way to get him they hated
[51:12] Daniel so much and he knew it right then
[51:15] they write this law Daniel prays as he
[51:17] always does open up his you know bedroom
[51:20] windows and cries out to Jehovah God and
[51:22] praise God and you know and then and
[51:23] then of course he gets arrested he gets
[51:26] thrown in the a lion's den many times we
[51:28] find ourselves we can find ourselves in
[51:30] a lion's den who's been in a kind of a
[51:33] kind of a trial you think this is it
[51:35] it's over I'm done I don't know how I'm
[51:38] going to get out of this thing I'm I'm
[51:40] trapped this is it but you see it wasn't
[51:42] over for Daniel cuz the angel of the
[51:44] Lord came down into the pit am mean came
[51:46] down into the trial and God had
[51:48] Fellowship amen God had fellowship with
[51:51] his prophet and those Lions amen were
[51:53] just his pillows to have a good night's
[51:55] sleep amen but that that's not the end
[51:57] of the story amen that's not the end of
[51:59] the story because when Daniel got lifted
[52:00] out his accusers got thrown in
[52:03] Hallelujah so the liines then amen was a
[52:05] way of Escape that when Daniel went to
[52:07] work the next day those hindering
[52:09] problems in his life were gone and they
[52:12] could never ever come back
[52:16] Hallelujah so don't you say I'm going
[52:18] through a trial it's a way of Escape
[52:20] it's a way of Deliverance it's for your
[52:23] good God wants to get some monkeys off
[52:25] your back and get some trouble out of
[52:27] your life he wants to take that NE
[52:30] negativity and that you know cynical
[52:32] sarcastic attitude he wants to take
[52:34] those things away amen that we can walk
[52:36] and say God is able amen God is the same
[52:39] yesterday today and forever this message
[52:41] Works
[52:43] hallelujah amen but you see many times
[52:47] we we look at life and we just say well
[52:49] it just gets too complex and it puts a
[52:52] Temptation upon us just to hide away
[52:55] when uh when when the midianites and the
[52:57] children of the East they came and
[52:59] basically just just took over Israel
[53:00] this in the days of Gideon here you know
[53:02] Israel Israel saw this and the and and
[53:05] they gave way to the temptation just to
[53:08] quit we're just going to make dens we're
[53:10] going to make strongholds we're just
[53:11] going to go live in some caves maybe the
[53:13] day before they're living on a nice big
[53:15] plane and big farmland and all these
[53:17] things but when this enemy came in it
[53:20] was just too big they just they did not
[53:23] look for the way of Escape there's
[53:25] always a temptation to Shell up or go to
[53:28] God remember here's the way of Escape
[53:31] there's always a Temptation life just
[53:32] gets too complex what's going to happen
[53:35] financially in the future what about my
[53:37] children you know all these things that
[53:38] you just don't seem to find the way out
[53:40] of it but if you seek the Lord he will
[53:43] point you to the exit sign he will point
[53:45] you to the way out amen because remember
[53:47] with every Temptation with every trial
[53:49] there is a way of Escape amen but they
[53:52] decided well we're just going to we're
[53:54] just going to hide away and just try to
[53:56] ride this thing out we're not called to
[53:58] ride things out friends no when trouble
[54:01] comes in we're called to that's a time
[54:03] where we really go to the Lord Lord
[54:05] You're In My Time of trouble am mean
[54:07] Lord You're present here in this in this
[54:09] trial Lord and he'll show you a way of
[54:13] Escape see life gets too difficult
[54:15] people hide their hide from their
[54:17] problems because they don't look for a
[54:19] way of Escape how many people are have
[54:22] have have hidden into an online world to
[54:24] escape life's problems they can't seem
[54:27] to navigate way through they just you
[54:29] know you the problem you know the
[54:30] pressure just gets too much and what
[54:33] does it do it just caus them to escape
[54:35] into a wrong place of
[54:38] Escape Doom scrolling is not going to
[54:40] deliver
[54:41] you streaming binge binge watching some
[54:44] series that ain't going to help you
[54:47] that's hiding in a cave that's hiding in
[54:49] a stronghold but it doesn't deal with
[54:51] the problem they were hidden in caves
[54:52] but the midianites were still there it
[54:54] took God to come down and speak to
[54:56] Gideon you're a mighty man of Valor and
[54:58] Gideon was threshing weed in secret
[55:00] trying to just survive cuz the problem
[55:02] seemed too great and God threw him
[55:04] brought a great Deliverance amen God
[55:07] showed him the way of
[55:08] Escape praise the Lord so we never want
[55:12] to get to a place we just Escape into a
[55:14] fantasy
[55:16] world brother bam tells a story of a of
[55:19] a woman uh you know young lady and she
[55:22] had she had a a heart trouble she had a

[55:32] she had formed this world I was read
[55:34] this but you know she was still in love
[55:36] with this man and this boy was telling
[55:38] her she was in love yet with her but his
[55:40] father had caused it I said that's
[55:42] nonsense he didn't have to marry the
[55:44] other girl he did it because he failed
[55:47] to have the right kind of love for you
[55:49] that's exactly but see being wound up
[55:52] into that the girl just sit there in
[55:53] like a stoop she said oh I know Johnny
[55:55] loves me I know see that's all she could
[55:58] see she lived in that little world by
[56:00] herself she formed herself in there and
[56:03] sadly many people today they form
[56:05] theirselves their own little world maybe
[56:07] it's just a negative mindset it can be a
[56:10] world that's not a real world we should
[56:11] be positive we have the good news our
[56:14] God is able amen there's nothing too
[56:16] hard for the Lord there's nothing
[56:18] there's no pit too deep there's no
[56:19] struggle too great there's no problem
[56:21] too complex that he can't solve that he
[56:23] can't ride in and bring the victory
[56:25] there's nothing too hard for the Lord
[56:26] you're not a unique case God has
[56:29] delivered if we had testimony time you
[56:31] could take the testimonies of Believers
[56:33] you'd realize there's been many people
[56:35] have walked through your your trial your
[56:37] mind battle your depression your
[56:38] struggle whatever it is God's already
[56:40] brought many through and they would say
[56:43] God I realize God revealed to me there's
[56:45] a way of Escape out of this problem amen
[56:49] and they got out of it you see but she
[56:51] had built this little world that all she
[56:53] could see was that Johnny still loved
[56:54] her but Johnny didn't love her at all
[56:57] didn't have the right kind of love just
[56:59] a just a selfish love what what could he
[57:01] get out of her and then he was done and
[57:03] married someone else but you see now
[57:05] brother Brown would say that he he would
[57:07] took her by the hand said listen to me
[57:09] and the Lord showed her vision you see
[57:11] and she show and she know I know nothing
[57:13] about that something had taken place
[57:15] that transaction between them and when
[57:17] that was said then that snapped her
[57:19] right quick so when the Lord speaks to
[57:21] you when you realize someone's preaching
[57:23] and you're and it's and it's basically a
[57:25] conversation you had driving to church
[57:27] or it's thoughts you've been having or a
[57:29] meditation in the word and it comes over
[57:31] the pulpit maybe it's been in Sunday
[57:32] school now it's being preached on God's
[57:34] trying to get your attention he's trying
[57:36] to snap you out of a little world that
[57:37] you have formed am me to realize look
[57:40] this is you're not meant to live in this
[57:42] kind of a condition you know mean to
[57:44] live addicted to social media and just
[57:46] caught up in your own little world and
[57:47] negative and depressed and cynical or
[57:49] sarcastic because of maybe what's
[57:51] happened in the past no God wants to
[57:53] snap you out of it amen but the main
[57:55] thing is when you realize God's here
[57:56] God's speaking that's when you look for
[57:58] his Mercy that's when you look for his
[58:00] Deliverance that's when you look for his
[58:01] way of Escape I mean more than just oh
[58:03] that's neat he's done it before no don't
[58:05] look at it like that you say God you're
[58:07] speaking to my life you're interested in
[58:08] my condition Lord and you're showing me
[58:10] a way of
[58:12] Escape that's why brother B said you
[58:14] know look to Calvary that's the only way
[58:17] back you see you just get uh ourselves
[58:19] Focus till whether we live or die sinkle
[58:21] dry it's Calvary Christ that's the thing
[58:24] that God wants us to come back to I mean
[58:26] you focus on his Mercy like brother Ram
[58:28] says the blood of Jesus Christ has never
[58:30] given anyone a complex has never done
[58:33] anything negative to any person ever
[58:35] it's only done positive it's only
[58:37] delivered saved redeemed healed amen so
[58:40] just look to that there's still Power in
[58:42] the Blood
[58:44] hallelujah amen we'll come to David a
[58:46] bit
[58:48] more you know even negative thinking is
[58:50] a false world how often can people get
[58:53] into a negative train of thought brother
[58:56] would say in what is the Holy Ghost I
[58:58] don't have the quote here but you know
[58:59] he said him and his wife open their
[59:01] Bibles they had a time of rededication
[59:03] to the Lord and and and he said Lord we
[59:06] want to consecrate ourselves in new to
[59:08] God for a complete service that we would
[59:10] surrender our own wills and everything
[59:12] and every negative thought and to serve
[59:14] the Lord Jesus so if he had to come to a
[59:17] place Lord I Surrender every negative
[59:18] thought I think we need to do that from
[59:20] time to time I mean we don't want to
[59:22] form ourselves in a world where
[59:24] everything's wrong everything is
[59:26] actually
[59:27] good God's plan is is is fulfilling
[59:30] itself God's right on time he's never
[59:33] out of control doesn't matter what H
[59:35] what you see out there God God's in
[59:38] control right we shouldn't be negative
[59:40] about life the devil because the reason
[59:43] we get Negative is the devil sells us a
[59:44] lie this is just how it is cu he doesn't
[59:48] want you to see a way of Escape he wants
[59:50] you to be trapped just just like that
[59:52] girl all she could see was that was that
[59:54] Johnny Johnny love her but of course he
[59:57] didn't have the right kind of a love
[59:58] formed herself into that little thing
[1:00:00] but you see now David David had a
[1:00:03] revelation God always gives a way of
[1:00:05] Escape when my heart is overwhelmed lead
[1:00:08] me to the Rock that's higher than I so
[1:00:10] he realized Lord when I get when I can't
[1:00:12] cope in life lead me to the Revelation
[1:00:15] that's higher than I lead me to the
[1:00:16] revelation of who you are and who I am
[1:00:18] in you so he's saying Lord lead me to
[1:00:21] that way of
[1:00:22] Escape amen do you do that I trust you
[1:00:24] do that amen you feel like you can't get
[1:00:27] out of something God is here to
[1:00:30] deliver now we know the devil's a
[1:00:32] trickster we we battle a very he may be
[1:00:35] a defeated enemy but he's a very shrewd
[1:00:37] enemy he's not a dummy right and he
[1:00:40] knows that human he knows the human
[1:00:43] condition he knows how you're built and
[1:00:45] he knows how to use it against
[1:00:47] you now there's a trap that uh people
[1:00:49] used to trap monkeys it's called a well
[1:00:51] I just called it a monkey trap and um
[1:00:54] what it is is is that they hollow out a
[1:00:57] coconut and and and they put something
[1:00:59] in it that a monkey likes to eat now
[1:01:01] that hole in the Coconut is just wide
[1:01:03] enough for the for the monkey to get his
[1:01:06] hand in when it's got nothing in it
[1:01:08] who's ever reached it and got something
[1:01:10] but as soon as you grab it you can't
[1:01:11] pull it out who's ever had that
[1:01:13] experience right so so that's the size
[1:01:15] they make the hole in the Coconut now
[1:01:17] the purpose of this is that the is that
[1:01:19] the Trappers want to want to catch the
[1:01:21] monkey to sell the monkey to maybe end
[1:01:22] up in a zoo or somewhere and this is
[1:01:24] what the devil wants to do many many
[1:01:26] times he doesn't want to name us but he
[1:01:27] wants to put us in a cage he wants to
[1:01:29] put us in a cage for his own Amusement
[1:01:31] that's why you look at the zoo what's
[1:01:32] the zoo really sure does n you know
[1:01:35] nature stuff and whatever and you know
[1:01:37] endangered species but really ultimately
[1:01:39] it's Amusement let's go see the sunbe
[1:01:42] let's go see the Lions and what oh
[1:01:43] that's neat you know but the devil wants
[1:01:46] to take a zoo make us into a human Zoo
[1:01:49] where we're just his Amusement oh look
[1:01:51] what I got them trapped in look what
[1:01:52] I've got this false little they think
[1:01:54] they're living it up like a you a poor
[1:01:57] lion that's in the zoo here he ain't he
[1:01:59] ain't in the Krueger no more he ain't he
[1:02:01] ain't running the savanas of Africa Wild
[1:02:03] and Free anymore he's in a fake he's in
[1:02:05] a fake little world just for people to
[1:02:08] come look at him and this is what the
[1:02:09] devil does he puts us into a fake little
[1:02:11] world where we think it's so important
[1:02:13] oh I can't miss the next series and I
[1:02:15] can't miss this and I got to watch you
[1:02:17] know you know the world will continue on
[1:02:18] if you don't go on on
[1:02:21] Instagram Tik Tok is going to well it's
[1:02:23] going to get banned in the states I
[1:02:24] think praise God
[1:02:26] ban Crazy Town you don't need it you
[1:02:28] don't need that it's a monkey trap why
[1:02:30] because all those things the reason
[1:02:32] they're addictive is because they've
[1:02:33] tapped into and they've actually called
[1:02:35] it brain hacking they know how to
[1:02:37] manipulate this to keep you engaged hey
[1:02:40] because if it wasn't addictive who would
[1:02:41] be on
[1:02:42] it no one that's who maybe a bunch of
[1:02:45] bots and you know all those things but
[1:02:47] you see it's it's engineered just like
[1:02:49] this is engineered to catch the
[1:02:52] monkey why because the Trapper knows the
[1:02:56] condition of the he knows the he he
[1:02:58] knows how a monkey Works wants a certain
[1:03:00] little thing he's got to put his hand
[1:03:02] now this monkey can be free anytime it
[1:03:05] just has to let
[1:03:07] go the way of Escape for the monkey is
[1:03:09] to let go but you see the problem is the
[1:03:12] monkey likes to hold on to what it's got
[1:03:14] It's wanted this thing it's had it
[1:03:16] before Oh this is Yum you see and and
[1:03:18] this is what the devil does with Human
[1:03:20] Condition people actually like they know
[1:03:22] there's a way of Escape they know that
[1:03:24] God can deliver but all the they need to
[1:03:26] do but they like holding on to what
[1:03:27] they've got in their hand it's a trap
[1:03:31] it's a trap we got to realize that and
[1:03:33] but people are afraid to say hey I'm
[1:03:36] actually trapped by the spirit I'm
[1:03:38] actually troubled in My Mind by this
[1:03:39] thing I can't you know be because
[1:03:42] there's always the devil puts shame in
[1:03:45] his traps he puts a shame in there that
[1:03:47] you feel like I can't I can't confess
[1:03:50] this thing I can't expose
[1:03:51] them and but the thing is we've got to
[1:03:54] be willing remember you're actually
[1:03:55] exposing the devil to get rid of him out
[1:03:57] of your life it's worth it every time
[1:04:01] there's no point keeping your hand
[1:04:02] trapped in a like a monkey trap why
[1:04:04] don't you just walk free says monkey
[1:04:05] just all he need to do is let
[1:04:07] go but he wanted what was in the Trap he
[1:04:10] he wanted it now brother Ram says
[1:04:13] now uh all that just depends on what you
[1:04:16] want to see you're a free moral agent
[1:04:18] you act on uh whatever you desire to act
[1:04:22] upon right God has put before you like
[1:04:24] the Garden of Eden the tree of life or
[1:04:26] the tree of death you make your choice
[1:04:27] see whatever your soul is Charmed for
[1:04:30] that's what you'll eat so what is the
[1:04:32] desire in your life what do you you know
[1:04:35] because we know we live in a busy age
[1:04:38] right we live in the hustle and bustle
[1:04:40] of life it's busy man 24/7 life is busy
[1:04:44] but the things you really enjoy you will
[1:04:47] make time
[1:04:48] for you'll make time for it if you
[1:04:50] really enjoy it you'll really you know
[1:04:52] make the time you will lose sleep you'll
[1:04:54] do whatever you need to do I've got to
[1:04:55] do this thing now how much more now now
[1:04:58] are we Charmed by the world or we
[1:04:59] Charmed by the word of God what's
[1:05:02] Charming us what's really captivated us
[1:05:05] what are we what are we a prisoner to
[1:05:07] amen are we a prisoner to God's word are
[1:05:09] we a prisoner to to the devil cuz
[1:05:11] everything the devil just gives cheap
[1:05:13] counterfeits there's no value in what he
[1:05:16] has it's just a copy of what God does
[1:05:18] you know know I've shared this before
[1:05:20] but you know as you all know I was a you
[1:05:22] I was a lost University student made
[1:05:23] home brew and you know did all those
[1:05:25] things but God found me in that
[1:05:26] condition then I remember after the Lord
[1:05:28] met me changed my life and I was at a
[1:05:30] youth camp and you know the spirit of
[1:05:31] God was poured out and I felt drunk I
[1:05:34] was drunk in the spirit like the Apostle
[1:05:36] Paul says about and I felt drunk like I
[1:05:38] was back in the world but there's
[1:05:39] nothing perverse about it and I realize
[1:05:42] true everything the devil has made is a
[1:05:43] cheap copy to what God has to give you I
[1:05:47] mean so why why keep your hand in a trap
[1:05:50] and say oh this is great when you could
[1:05:51] actually enjoy the original what what
[1:05:54] the devil's copied off and amen and walk
[1:05:56] free and really have a good
[1:05:58] timeall praise the Lord so I pray that
[1:06:01] whatever is charming our souls will not
[1:06:03] be will not be a Temptation Of The Devil
[1:06:07] but you got to remember there's a way of
[1:06:08] Escape there's always a way of
[1:06:12] Escape
[1:06:13] amen now Samson's monkey trap was
[1:06:19] Delilah God knew I mean sorry the devil
[1:06:21] knew how to trap him and it wasn't by
[1:06:25] cords it was n by Philistine worries it
[1:06:26] was by the love of fake love of a woman
[1:06:29] and so remember any time he could have
[1:06:33] he could have taken his hand out of the
[1:06:35] Trap right he could have if he wanted to
[1:06:38] but because he enjoyed his hand on what
[1:06:40] he had he was just willing to let it
[1:06:43] keep going and he and you know he's just
[1:06:45] so engrossed in it but you see he had to
[1:06:47] get to a condition where he became
[1:06:49] physically blind he was a prisoner there
[1:06:51] to the Philistines for him to wake up
[1:06:53] and realize there's a way of Escape
[1:06:56] amen cuz there's a way of Escape for
[1:06:57] everyone in every condition never think
[1:07:00] that there's no way out there's always a
[1:07:01] way out amen so so Samson Samson
[1:07:05] realized amen at the at the end of his
[1:07:08] life he says once more Lord I want to
[1:07:11] step out of I want to take your way of
[1:07:13] Escape I'm willing to die with this
[1:07:15] monkey trap that I can be free amen and
[1:07:18] we know he killed more in his death than
[1:07:20] he did in his life he got
[1:07:23] free amen
[1:07:26] how do you know the cause what does a CA
[1:07:28] what does a trap cause you to do well it
[1:07:30] takes your joy away in the Lord you
[1:07:33] don't pray like you used to you don't
[1:07:35] read like you used to you don't you're
[1:07:37] not happy like you used to be amen I
[1:07:40] remember when I first met the Lord you
[1:07:43] know I was changed the condition of the
[1:07:46] world and the Troubles of the world were
[1:07:47] still the same but I was happy I was
[1:07:50] rejoicing it was all good you see so God
[1:07:53] God will change you maybe he'll leave
[1:07:54] the conditions they your whole outlook
[1:07:56] will be different but what you've
[1:07:57] received eternal life amen God's
[1:07:59] transformed your soul it's a great thing
[1:08:03] amen praise the
[1:08:05] Lord
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:10] now you say you know because the devil
[1:08:13] wants us to think there's no way
[1:08:15] out now I don't know if any of us have
[1:08:18] ever had ever had uh what do you call it
[1:08:20] symptoms like Jonah the Book of Jonah
[1:08:23] says he ran from the presence of the
[1:08:24] Lord he willingly chose I'm going to
[1:08:27] escape what God wants me to do and he
[1:08:29] found himself in a in a whales belly
[1:08:32] none of us have been in that kind of a
[1:08:33] condition but Jonah Jonah knew that if
[1:08:36] he looked towards Solomon's Temple that
[1:08:38] was dedicated and when Solomon prayed he
[1:08:41] said God if anyone looks towards your
[1:08:42] Holy Temple you'll hear them from heaven
[1:08:44] now I don't know how Jonah was by faith
[1:08:46] he looked and he and he looked by faith
[1:08:48] towards the temple he is surrounded by
[1:08:50] whales belly no doubt the devil was was
[1:08:53] condemnation was just gripping him you
[1:08:55] know before that happened where where
[1:08:57] the devil's telling him this is you
[1:09:00] there's no way out you can't get out of
[1:09:03] this fish you're
[1:09:05] stuck has the devil told you that right
[1:09:09] but you see don't let condemnation hold
[1:09:12] you see the devil condemns in a way that
[1:09:15] there's no way out God convicts CU he
[1:09:17] wants to show you the way of Escape amen
[1:09:20] he wants you to be free he doesn't want
[1:09:21] you to be trapped in whatever you're
[1:09:22] trapped in amen so so Daniel I mean
[1:09:25] sorry Jonah Jonah the reason he had the
[1:09:28] faith that he had wrapped up in seaweed
[1:09:30] and vomiting everything around him I
[1:09:32] mean is because it was a revelation to
[1:09:34] him Lord if I look to your temple amen
[1:09:36] you'll hear me from heaven and then what
[1:09:38] he did is so so in that moment when he
[1:09:41] looked and prayed and repented and gave
[1:09:43] his life to the Lord like that amen God
[1:09:46] made him a way of Escape amen he made a
[1:09:48] way of Escape for Jonah I mean he did it
[1:09:51] how he did it well nobody knows but it's
[1:09:53] God's own secret but no matter whether
[1:09:55] it was impossible God can alter
[1:09:57] circumstances he can make the impossible
[1:09:59] become a probable and not only probable
[1:10:02] he can make it a reality when God when
[1:10:04] men take God at his word and accept the
[1:10:06] provided way that God has for him he me
[1:10:09] you got to realize that if you're
[1:10:10] trapped in anything it's lying
[1:10:12] vanities it's lying vanities it'll come
[1:10:15] it'll go it's not even you
[1:10:17] know and if You observe like like the
[1:10:20] monkey let's go back to this CU I like
[1:10:22] the picture but he all he does is study
[1:10:24] I can't get it out I want this thing all
[1:10:27] he's looking at is is is the lying
[1:10:29] vanities of you know the Trap cuz in
[1:10:31] reality he could just let it go and he
[1:10:32] could be free but by doing that he's
[1:10:34] forsaking his own mercies he's forsaking
[1:10:36] his way of
[1:10:37] Escape amen but aren't you glad that
[1:10:40] God's given us a big Open Door amen he's
[1:10:43] given us a way of Escape praise the
[1:10:46] Lord now there comes Temptation from
[1:10:49] time to time because of
[1:10:51] circumstances that we want to quit who's
[1:10:54] ever been there let's be honest yeah you
[1:10:57] come to a point life just gets too much
[1:10:59] it gets you know it's like you're trying
[1:11:01] to walk through some big fog and you
[1:11:02] don't know the way out or anything you
[1:11:04] just want to quit now David got to
[1:11:08] points of life where he you know says
[1:11:11] here when he came back to Zig the place
[1:11:13] is burnt their families are gone I mean
[1:11:16] Saul's just um you know he's dying in
[1:11:18] battle and there's a time when he's
[1:11:19] about to you know David's very close to
[1:11:21] being being placed on the throne like he
[1:11:23] was ordained to be placed on the throne
[1:11:25] but then when they came back to Zig and
[1:11:27] their families were gone the place was
[1:11:29] burnt down it says and David was greatly
[1:11:31] distressed this is where this is where
[1:11:33] our hearts can get very
[1:11:34] overwhelmed and where where he could
[1:11:38] look at this and maybe he got to you so
[1:11:41] distressed because remember there always
[1:11:42] comes a moment there's always a before
[1:11:43] and an after there's the initial shock
[1:11:47] what's happened now you got to realize
[1:11:49] and and I'm just going to quote Shannon
[1:11:51] Lee here with teenagers don't overact
[1:11:54] cuz they always do crazy things and the
[1:11:57] reason you can say that is because
[1:11:59] there's always a way of
[1:12:01] Escape right out of out of whatever
[1:12:03] people do there's a way of Escape amen
[1:12:06] so David he would have had the before of
[1:12:08] the shock and you know his men you know
[1:12:10] his men that forsook all and followed
[1:12:12] him and believed he was going to become
[1:12:13] king they were they were speaking of
[1:12:15] stoning him so this is the lowest moment
[1:12:17] really of his life but then so so he had
[1:12:20] a Temptation come in but then he thought
[1:12:23] no God you're going to make a way of
[1:12:25] Escape out of this he didn't know the
[1:12:27] answer at that very moment but then but
[1:12:29] then he begin to encourage himself in
[1:12:31] the Lord his God because when you begin
[1:12:33] to encourage yourself in the Lord am
[1:12:35] mean God then opens a way of Escape he
[1:12:37] gives the way out of the
[1:12:39] situation Hallelujah because you got to
[1:12:41] realize that you know many times we you
[1:12:44] know we read the Psalms and we draw
[1:12:45] strength out of those Revelations but
[1:12:47] they were given to David for a reason
[1:12:50] God God poured Revelation into him I
[1:12:52] mean of those psalms because God knew
[1:12:54] David would need those in times of his
[1:12:56] life where he was more than just looking
[1:12:58] back and reflecting and writing those
[1:12:59] things but he would draw strength from
[1:13:01] that Revelation in times of great need
[1:13:04] and this was definitely one of them amen
[1:13:06] where where where here's um here's David
[1:13:09] and he begin to encourage himself in the
[1:13:10] Lord has gone now let's just read some
[1:13:13] of these things I don't have it up here
[1:13:14] but you know maybe he would have begin
[1:13:17] to play the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[1:13:20] not want he's lost everything right at
[1:13:23] this moment the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:13:24] shall not want want he maketh me to lie
[1:13:26] down in Green Pastures he leadth me
[1:13:28] beside the Still Waters he restoreth my
[1:13:30] soul he leadth me in the paths of
[1:13:32] righteousness for his name's sake ye
[1:13:34] though I walk through the valley the
[1:13:35] shadow of death I'll fear no evil for
[1:13:37] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[1:13:39] they comfort me thou preparest a table
[1:13:41] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:13:43] thou anointeth my head with oil my cup
[1:13:46] runthe goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:13:48] me all the days of my life and I'll
[1:13:50] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:13:52] he's playing this in the in the ruins of
[1:13:54] zigg he's encouraging ing himself in the
[1:13:55] Lord cuz he's saying Lord where is the
[1:13:57] way of Escape but Lord you've been my
[1:13:59] shepherd am mean you've Lead Me beside
[1:14:01] Still Waters you've lead me through the
[1:14:03] valley of the shadow of death Lord
[1:14:04] You've lead me through many things Lord
[1:14:06] now what is the way of Escape out of
[1:14:08] this Hallelujah that was a revelation to
[1:14:11] David he began to draw strength from
[1:14:13] Revelation what do we draw strength from
[1:14:14] today I trust it's the revelation of the
[1:14:17] word amen David David would write in
[1:14:20] Psalms 27 now I'm WR I'm I'm quoting
[1:14:22] these because they're very particular to
[1:14:24] us as well
[1:14:25] the Lord is my light in my salvation
[1:14:27] Psalm 27 the Rapture message the Lord is
[1:14:30] my light and my salvation Whom Shall I
[1:14:32] Fear the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:14:34] of whom shall I be afraid when the
[1:14:36] wicked even my enemies and my foes Came
[1:14:38] Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled
[1:14:40] and fell th H should encamp against me
[1:14:42] my my heart shall not fear th War should
[1:14:45] rise against me in this will I be
[1:14:46] confident one thing have I desired of
[1:14:49] the Lord that I will seek after that I
[1:14:50] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:14:53] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:14:54] of the the Lord and to inquire in his
[1:14:56] Temple for the time of trouble he shall
[1:14:58] hide me in his Pavilion and the secret
[1:15:00] of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he
[1:15:02] shall set me up upon a rock hallelujah
[1:15:07] so you know and no doubt when he's there
[1:15:09] you know going into ziggle the the Devil
[1:15:11] comes with condemnation you shouldn't
[1:15:13] have been in philistia you led your men
[1:15:16] here the reason all your families are
[1:15:17] gone is because of your leadership
[1:15:19] trying to trap him into these things but
[1:15:21] when he begin to draw strength from the
[1:15:22] Revelation in his soul amen he he be he
[1:15:25] he encouraged himself in the Lord and
[1:15:28] then God begin to God be to show him the
[1:15:30] way out he began to inquire of God and
[1:15:32] God showed him what to do now God hasn't
[1:15:34] just didn't just give David Revelation
[1:15:37] he's given you Revelation I mean he's
[1:15:39] quickened his word into your soul that
[1:15:41] in times of need you can draw strength
[1:15:43] out of that for God to bring you into a
[1:15:46] spiritual condition where you're not
[1:15:47] looking with your five senses of what
[1:15:49] you see what the Temptation is what
[1:15:51] you're feeling in your body we know
[1:15:53] temptation's a real thing right you we
[1:15:56] you genuinely feel it that's right if
[1:15:58] you don't are you human right but you
[1:16:01] genuinely feel it but but in that
[1:16:02] Temptation there's a way of Escape so
[1:16:04] what do you do you draw strength from
[1:16:05] the Revelation God's placed in your soul
[1:16:08] amen where you can look at what do you
[1:16:10] think about Colossians 2 I just got a
[1:16:13] few right I'm just going to read some
[1:16:15] scripture to you you draw strength from
[1:16:17] these things he says and you being dead
[1:16:18] in your sins and uncircumcision of your
[1:16:20] flesh had he quickened together with him
[1:16:22] having forgiven you all trespasses I
[1:16:25] mean blotting out the handwriting of
[1:16:27] ordinances that was against us which was
[1:16:29] contrary to us and took it out of the
[1:16:30] way nailing it to his cross and having
[1:16:33] spoiled principalities and Powers he
[1:16:35] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:16:37] over them in it he says in Isaiah 40 uh
[1:16:40] uh 54 behold I have created the Smith
[1:16:43] that bloweth the coals in the fire and
[1:16:45] that bringeth forth an instrument for
[1:16:46] his work and I have created the wasted
[1:16:48] to destroy no weapon that is formed
[1:16:51] against the shall prosper and every
[1:16:53] tongue that shall rise against the in
[1:16:54] judgement Thou shalt condemn this is the
[1:16:57] heritage of the Servants of the Lord and
[1:16:58] their righteousness is of me sayth the
[1:17:01] Lord amen who's ever had weapons formed
[1:17:04] against you Spirits have come against
[1:17:06] you troubles remember we're going to be
[1:17:07] tested by every spirit in this age we're
[1:17:10] going to be tested by every single one
[1:17:12] jealousy hatred malice Strife lust
[1:17:14] whatever it is pride arrogancy
[1:17:17] melancholic whatever Spirit it is will
[1:17:19] come against lukewarmness but God will
[1:17:21] bring us through them all amen so those
[1:17:25] weapons were formed against you because
[1:17:26] you got to realize you know in Hell your
[1:17:29] Public Enemy Number One as the Bride of
[1:17:31] Jesus Christ carrying the revelation of
[1:17:33] the word amen the devil hates you we
[1:17:35] hate him too you're allowed to hate
[1:17:37] someone that's the devil not your
[1:17:38] brother or sister not person on the
[1:17:39] street but the devil you're allowed to
[1:17:41] hate right you see so so the devil tries
[1:17:43] to devise how can I take these people
[1:17:46] down what weapon can I form against them
[1:17:49] but you see before we ever came upon the
[1:17:51] planet before the devil ever devised
[1:17:53] that weapon against you God God gave a
[1:17:55] revelation to Isaiah no weapon formed
[1:17:57] against the shall prosper amen it'll be
[1:17:59] formed but it's not going to win amen
[1:18:01] it's not going to take you out you're
[1:18:02] going to take it out by the revelation
[1:18:04] of the word hallelujah amen what is it

[1:18:09] Escape

[1:18:45] there's there's no way out we're not
[1:18:48] going to make it I say if you've
[1:18:49] received the Holy Ghost you've already
[1:18:51] made it you're sealed to the day of your
[1:18:53] Redemption you've already made it

[1:19:11] place for you and if I go and prepare a
[1:19:13] place for you I'll come again and
[1:19:14] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:19:17] there you may be also that receiving is
[1:19:19] the message being received by you that's
[1:19:21] God coming in word form to receive you
[1:19:23] unto himself that where he is in glory
[1:19:25] you will be taken also amen the Apostle
[1:19:28] Paul said we know that if our Earthly
[1:19:29] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved

[1:19:59] means there's a way of Escape out of
[1:20:00] every trial out of every
[1:20:02] Temptation praise the Lord and then
[1:20:05] David now he said to Aba the priest
[1:20:08] after he had read these scriptures
[1:20:09] because it was a revelation to him and
[1:20:11] he began to rejoice and he wasn't
[1:20:12] looking at zigg burnt anymore in the
[1:20:14] situation of his life he you know he he
[1:20:17] asked for ABA the priest you know to
[1:20:19] bring the epod inquired of the Lord what
[1:20:21] shall I do shall I pursue this Troop I
[1:20:24] overtake them and he answered him pursue
[1:20:27] for Thou shalt surely overtake them and
[1:20:29] without fail recover all so what happens
[1:20:32] is when you're looking for a way of
[1:20:34] Escape you should be praying Lord help
[1:20:36] me to put show me how to put my faith
[1:20:37] into action right this is what David's

[1:21:04] through the Red Sea amen and God will
[1:21:07] show you what to
[1:21:08] do praise the Lord now we know the

[1:21:23] believer down Through the Ages was
[1:21:24] looking for amen is upon us right now
[1:21:28] praise the Lord and so so just like when
[1:21:30] Jesus said because many people they look
[1:21:32] at the condition of the world I said the
[1:21:33] world's falling apart that's only half
[1:21:35] the picture when you see these things
[1:21:38] don't get burdened by them don't be
[1:21:39] trapped in them and you know form
[1:21:41] political viewpoints and let this world
[1:21:43] polarize you against another group no
[1:21:45] lift up your heads for you know that
[1:21:47] when you see these things you know
[1:21:48] Redemption is drawing nigh amen that the
[1:21:51] Lord is here to take us away Hallelujah
[1:21:54] I'm so glad for that aren't you amen
[1:21:58] praise the Lord but you see the devil
[1:21:59] will try and trap us to think that we
[1:22:01] can't get out brother BR was in a
[1:22:03] meeting he called out a soldier boy in
[1:22:04] the back of the meeting brother Ed Bisal
[1:22:06] shares this testimony and and and and
[1:22:08] and the soldier boy he was trying to
[1:22:11] commit suicide because he was secretly
[1:22:13] so he's married he had children but he
[1:22:15] was he was committing homosexual acts in
[1:22:18] secret on the army base and and of
[1:22:19] course the devil said well you're
[1:22:21] trapped in this thing there's no way out
[1:22:23] and so the devil but the devil just
[1:22:25] lying to him you know the Lord spoke out
[1:22:28] what's the matter soldier boy you're not
[1:22:30] going to commit suicide that's a devil
[1:22:31] lying to you that's the devil lying to
[1:22:33] you that there's no way out and if you
[1:22:35] think there's no way out I I know I've
[1:22:37] repeated this but I I I feel I need to
[1:22:40] if you feel there's no way out that's a
[1:22:41] lie you're being bound by a lie that's
[1:22:44] not even real I mean there is a way
[1:22:46] out there is a way out but what you got
[1:22:49] to do you got to be willing to expose to
[1:22:51] stop being a human shield for that trap
[1:22:54] and let the let God destroy it out of
[1:22:56] your life because it says in Proverbs he
[1:22:59] that
[1:23:05] coverthe and forsaketh them Shall Have
[1:23:08] Mercy amen so they shall have their way
[1:23:11] of Escape am mean so never even think
[1:23:13] well what do people think of me well I
[1:23:15] think honestly if you confess it out of
[1:23:16] a genuine heart they'll respect you for
[1:23:18] that that's a real man he's been pushed
[1:23:20] down but he wants to get back up amen he
[1:23:22] wants to keep walking with God he's not
[1:23:24] letting this thing Define him anymore
[1:23:26] but he wants to walk with God to me
[1:23:27] that's a real Christian that's a real
[1:23:29] believer that's an overcomer amen be
[1:23:31] willing to confess and forsake like the
[1:23:33] monkey man I'm in a trap how's he how's
[1:23:36] he forsake it just let It Go Don't Let
[1:23:38] It control his mind
[1:23:41] anymore amen there is a way of
[1:23:44] Escape praise the Lord I'm just I'm just
[1:23:47] going to bring this to a close real soon
[1:23:49] he says now brother says this in the Red
[1:23:51] Sea he showed that he would make a way
[1:23:53] for those who are trying to do do right
[1:23:54] and follow his Commandments no matter
[1:23:56] what cuts it off God proved at the Red
[1:23:59] Sea and gave a sign that he would open
[1:24:00] up the sea in every Temptation he'll
[1:24:02] make a way of Escape say well mother
[1:24:04] don't believe it Daddy don't believe it
[1:24:06] the church don't believe it I don't care
[1:24:07] who don't believe it if you believe it
[1:24:08] God Will Make A Way of Escape he gave a
[1:24:11] sign that he would they were on their
[1:24:13] way straight to the promised land where
[1:24:14] God promised them and the Red Sea shut
[1:24:16] them off and they got in trouble they
[1:24:18] didn't know what to do God showed that
[1:24:20] he would make a way of Escape in every
[1:24:21] Temptation every trial if you can't quit
[1:24:24] smoking take God one time if you can't
[1:24:26] quit lying can't quit stealing can't

[1:25:58] patient she said yes I am he said well
[1:26:00] what's wrong with you she said I'm
[1:26:02] suppose I'm insane she and brother BR
[1:26:05] said I don't uh I'm sure you sure don't
[1:26:07] look it uh she said would you listen to
[1:26:10] my story I said certainly she said well
[1:26:11] when I was a younger girl brother Braham
[1:26:13] I was raised in a real Christian home
[1:26:15] and I started going with a boy that
[1:26:16] smoked and said first thing you know I
[1:26:19] was smoking so what's happened she's
[1:26:20] been trapped into something she's been
[1:26:23] trapped the devil's trapped because
[1:26:25] naturally she wants a she wants a
[1:26:27] boyfriend one day to get married all
[1:26:28] these things the devil's used that it's
[1:26:30] a Temptation entered into her life with
[1:26:32] the wrong guy and now she's trapped by
[1:26:34] this thing and then one night he he he
[1:26:38] spiked a coat with whiskey that started
[1:26:39] me drinking I started from that to
[1:26:41] prostitution and she said I've lived in
[1:26:43] the very gutters of the blackest hell
[1:26:46] but she wants to get out of it she said
[1:26:48] I I've served four years in the Catholic
[1:26:49] institution good Shepherd's home said in
[1:26:52] there I turned a new page I said when I
[1:26:54] get out of here I'm going to go straight
[1:26:56] many times that's where as far as people
[1:26:58] go they think that's it but that's just
[1:27:01] the beginning right I said I meant it
[1:27:04] but as soon as I got with the crowd
[1:27:06] again it was all over then I said I did
[1:27:08] two years in a woman's State
[1:27:09] Penitentiary here in this state I said
[1:27:12] there I thought truly I was reformed I
[1:27:15] come home and join another church I told
[1:27:16] the pastor we went down to the Altar and
[1:27:18] talked it over but she said I just can't
[1:27:21] keep from it she said it started one
[1:27:23] night I said lady don't you want to be a
[1:27:25] real lady and have a hubby and babies
[1:27:28] and like a real woman would so he's
[1:27:30] putting out a picture don't you really
[1:27:31] want this and she's like yes but she's
[1:27:33] been trapped in the cycle and she's
[1:27:35] turned Pages joined churches in prison
[1:27:37] she thought well I'm truly reformed why
[1:27:39] cuz the Temptation wasn't there in
[1:27:42] prison removing temptation is not sure
[1:27:45] shown the very appearance of evil but
[1:27:47] you know to overcome something is when
[1:27:50] it's not in here anymore right like I
[1:27:52] said about drinking I could live in
[1:27:54] Brewery I'd be the most soberest guy
[1:27:56] life there's nothing in here that wants
[1:27:57] it anymore it's gone God took it from me
[1:27:59] I don't have to keep myself from those
[1:28:01] things it's
[1:28:03] gone praise the Lord amen so she said
[1:28:07] with all my heart she said but look at
[1:28:09] me now so basically she's saying I'm
[1:28:11] trapped I can't get out of this the
[1:28:13] devil said I I can't I've tried and I've
[1:28:15] tried I said but you haven't tried my
[1:28:17] Lord yet she said yes I have two brother
[1:28:19] bam I've signed pledges and vows and
[1:28:21] made promises to God I said that's not
[1:28:24] what I'm talking about see but that's
[1:28:26] you're someone
[1:28:28] trying to find the way of Escape humanly
[1:28:32] trying to no that's just a human effort
[1:28:34] trying to escape but I'm talking about a
[1:28:35] different way of Escape yes sir I'm
[1:28:37] talking about a total Deliverance way of
[1:28:39] escape and I said that that's not what
[1:28:42] I'm talking about I said as as
[1:28:44] oldfashioned as it may seem to be it's a
[1:28:46] devil she said I've always believe that
[1:28:48] he said he drives you to do things that
[1:28:50] you don't want to do she said I believe
[1:28:52] that she said would there be any hope
[1:28:54] for me I said certainly and we knelt
[1:28:55] down to pray and after a while she
[1:28:57] raised up beautiful woman great soft
[1:29:00] looking eyes she looked up and tears
[1:29:01] running down her cheeks she said now
[1:29:03] brother Bram I believe I'm going to go
[1:29:04] out and make a new
[1:29:06] life how many times do people just get
[1:29:09] there it's good to get emotional it's
[1:29:12] good to because remember this is her
[1:29:14] heart she wanted out of this trap you
[1:29:16] know she wasn't being halfed about this
[1:29:18] this was this thing she wanted the way
[1:29:20] of Escape she was looking for it and
[1:29:22] many times we just get to an emotion
[1:29:24] state which is good and we think we're
[1:29:26] free but brother Bram said sister dear
[1:29:29] you simply turning a page it wouldn't do
[1:29:31] any good I said you've done that so many
[1:29:33] times I said just stay there until God
[1:29:35] speaks back to you we got down there
[1:29:37] together and prayed and I left her
[1:29:39] praying went on pray with with with the
[1:29:41] other people and after a while she rosed
[1:29:43] up from there looked around the room
[1:29:44] those big eyes look at me she said
[1:29:46] something happened to me I said now
[1:29:48] you've got it now you've got it you
[1:29:49] don't have to turn new pages now it's
[1:29:51] happened you've got it and from that
[1:29:53] time she was a change person she's
[1:29:54] married she had a lovely home two
[1:29:55] children now she can point her finger to
[1:29:57] a time that something happened to her
[1:30:00] that was Immortal am mean things change
[1:30:03] life change but there's something that
[1:30:04] can change to a person that won't change
[1:30:07] you cannot be the same after this
[1:30:08] happens that's when man meets God he's
[1:30:11] changed Something's Happened to him he's
[1:30:12] never the same after he once meets God
[1:30:15] face to face where he has to come to the
[1:30:17] fact to either receive him or walk away
[1:30:19] from him he'll go away well a worse
[1:30:21] person or go away a new person but when
[1:30:23] you meet God something happens is
[1:30:25] immortality see that is the way of
[1:30:28] Escape more than an emotional thing I
[1:30:32] remember when I was trapped in the world
[1:30:35] parties drinking gaming all those kind
[1:30:38] of things but when I heard the message
[1:30:42] and brother R preaching on the Seal of
[1:30:43] God you must receive the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:30:45] like Lord I want to receive the Holy
[1:30:47] Ghost I didn't know what to do I didn't
[1:30:51] know what would happen but I knew I
[1:30:53] could meet him I knew here's my way of
[1:30:55] escape and and then so but I came to a
[1:30:58] place in my life where God brought me to
[1:31:00] a full
[1:31:01] surrender Hallelujah I was studying
[1:31:03] organic chemistry in the library there
[1:31:05] in Christ Church University and a
[1:31:06] conviction Came Upon me if you died
[1:31:08] right now where would you go and I went
[1:31:10] home because before that I meant
[1:31:11] business but I was just humanly meaning
[1:31:13] business but then God comes on the scene
[1:31:15] that's why if you draw n to him there's
[1:31:17] a way of Escape trust me there's a way
[1:31:19] of Escape I've experienced it that door
[1:31:21] is a wonderful thing to walk through
[1:31:23] Hallelujah and he changed my life he
[1:31:25] filled my heart with his love I've never
[1:31:27] been the same person why because it
[1:31:29] wasn't me trying to turn a new I tried
[1:31:31] to turn pages I tried to you know turn
[1:31:33] leaves like this woman did but then he
[1:31:36] came and changed
[1:31:38] me Hallelujah he is the way of escape
[1:31:42] and not just there but in every
[1:31:44] Temptation Of Life friends if you just

[1:32:00] going on in your life many of you but I
