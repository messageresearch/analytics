[52:53] through and all this sort of stuff aside

[52:56] on this morning Lord - to hear from you
[52:59] so we just want to commit this service
[53:00] to you this morning and just welcome you
[53:02] in our midst in Jesus name Amen amen
[53:06] god bless you all this morning you can
[53:08] um you can take your seats this morning
[53:10] praise the Lord amen how was it where
[53:17] I'm doing this morning good that's good
[53:21] okay I've got um I've had a little
[53:24] thought that that I've wanted to speak
[53:27] on and brother Freddy I think he
[53:31] preaches slightly on it last I think was
[53:34] two weeks ago when he was here and it's
[53:37] um yes sir some thoughts you you learn
[53:45] about and then you speak about and other
[53:49] thoughts you kind of go through a lot of
[53:51] things and then you speak about what you
[53:52] know about but those ones are slightly
[53:56] easier to talk about then ones that you
[53:58] learn about and speak about although
[53:59] there is a place for that because hey we
[54:01] can't go through everything all the time
[54:03] so some things we just have to learn for
[54:06] instance I couldn't really tell you what
[54:07] it's like to be a grandfather
[54:08] you know but maybe brother Franny
[54:11] he could because he's a grandfather but
[54:14] there are things I haven't been through
[54:15] which sure maybe I could speak about and
[54:17] try and show what the word says about it
[54:18] and what brother Branham says about it
[54:20] and things but you know when you go
[54:21] through things it's different you can
[54:23] you can talk about it so do we have
[54:27] anything going on there I've got a are
[54:29] we going on us okay now I don't really
[54:34] look like a fighting sort of a guy right
[54:45] [Laughter]
[54:48] however we are as Christians fighters
[54:52] with fighters we're not we're not like
[54:56] little weak people that have no backbone
[54:59] we've got courage we've got tenacity
[55:03] we've got determination let's how we do
[55:07] it and if there's anything I've learned
[55:10] in the Christian walk it's the fact that
[55:12] it's a constant fight fighting we've got
[55:16] a fight fight fight
[55:17] and I'm not going to tell you something
[55:20] that you haven't heard already but as
[55:21] Peter said you know I'm gonna stir these
[55:23] things up to your remembrance to just to
[55:25] help us to you know remember these
[55:28] things but also this did help me in my
[55:32] walk when I learnt when I when I fully
[55:34] understood that this is just a fight you
[55:36] know when I became reserved to that
[55:39] effect when I accepted it then I I guess
[55:41] I just got on with it started doing it
[55:43] rather than you know when things get hot
[55:45] and here but you kind of complained
[55:46] otherwise like this now I've accept that
[55:49] it will always be like this
[55:50] that's the way that it is is a brother
[55:53] that doesn't he does these creation
[55:55] science evangelism type things he's very
[55:59] witty guy and he says life is tough and
[56:03] then you die get over it and hey you
[56:09] know we've got to have a certain
[56:10] attitude in our Christian walk otherwise
[56:11] the the constant attacks of the enemy
[56:13] are going to get us down and we don't
[56:15] want to be we want to be a victorious
[56:17] people we don't we don't we want to go
[56:19] out victorious we don't want to go out
[56:21] you know we want to go out victorious
[56:23] that's who we are as a people and and
[56:26] that's that's what faith speaks of us
[56:28] faith speaks of us victory faith speaks
[56:31] of us that we're strong people that
[56:33] we're a mighty people it doesn't speak
[56:35] that we're are weak people now I'm not
[56:36] talking about our flesh men I'm talking
[56:38] about a spirit men anywhere oh I'll get
[56:41] into this because I've got a few things
[56:42] to get thrown off that preaching all the
[56:44] other slides before I get there
[56:46] and let's stand up once more just read
[56:48] this this
[56:49] this one here this is one first Timothy
[56:53] 6:12 and it says fight the good fight of
[56:56] faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto
[57:03] there are also called
[57:05] and has professed a good profession
[57:06] before many witnesses fight the good
[57:09] fight of faith and I've got another
[57:14] verse this is from Exodus 15 verses 1
[57:17] through 2 3 then saying Moses in the
[57:23] children of Israel of the song answer
[57:25] the Lord and spake saying I will sing
[57:26] unto the Lord for he has triumphed
[57:28] gloriously the horse and his rider hath
[57:31] he thrown into the sea the Lord is my
[57:33] strength and song and he has become my
[57:35] salvation he is my god and I will
[57:38] prepare him in habitation my father's
[57:40] God I will exalt him in verse 3 I like
[57:45] this verse the Lord is a man of war the
[57:50] Lord is his name Amen
[57:55] there's one more as I have 42 verse 13
[58:00] the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man
[58:03] he shall stir up jealousy like a man of
[58:06] war he shall cry yay roar he shall
[58:08] prevail against his enemies amen you can
[58:13] make all bliss of reading as well you
[58:14] can take your seats this morning
[58:16] I'm just gonna put that one ear back up
[58:18] right the Lord is a man of war the Lord
[58:22] has his name right now if you who's seen
[58:25] my son David he looks kind of similar to
[58:30] me and unfortunately for him he's got a
[58:33] similar natural personality to me and
[58:37] I'm battling with it so much hope is not
[58:38] listening because it's who knows like
[58:43] that if you're a parent here you see in
[58:45] your children you ought your they seem
[58:47] to in here all of your weaknesses are
[58:48] none of your streets and you're like
[58:50] manners some sort of a cruel joke and
[58:52] then you've got to spend your life
[58:53] trying to explain to them and get it out
[58:55] of them and it's awful within you almost
[58:57] get embarrassed when you see it but
[58:59] nonetheless why our endeavor as parents
[59:02] you see our traits and them right there
[59:04] you they look like us whatever we want
[59:05] them to be well you know we want to
[59:09] instill values in them
[59:10] well the Lord is the same with us with
[59:13] his children he wants to see his own
[59:15] values and his children his own
[59:18] attributes and you know we think of God
[59:20] as merciful and years and he's he's
[59:23] loving and he's he does all these things
[59:26] but one of the things he is he's a
[59:28] fighter
[59:29] he's a man of war and I think he wants
[59:32] to see their attribute also in us he
[59:34] wants to see us as fighters me and a
[59:37] woman of war he doesn't want to see us
[59:38] sitting back he wants to see his
[59:40] attributes in us I'll just read you this
[59:43] quote because this is brother man
[59:45] talking and adoption he says but what if
[59:48] he comes up that's Abraham's Grace
[59:50] Covenant and says but there's certain
[59:52] ones I'm telling you they are really
[59:54] your sons I don't care what takes place
[59:55] they stand for what you say they just
[59:58] act like you that man just acts exactly
[1:00:01] like you he does the same he says the
[1:00:04] same thing you do if the hired servants
[1:00:06] is throwing a thing you don't care it's
[1:00:08] his father's business I must be about it
[1:00:09] he just tears it up and says you shall
[1:00:11] not do that to my father
[1:00:12] my father said so and so and you you
[1:00:14] took the commands of God and made them a
[1:00:16] tradition of men no such a scripture in
[1:00:18] the Bible for such as stuff as that I
[1:00:20] know this is referring to something else
[1:00:21] but I just wanted to bring up the
[1:00:23] thought of adoption you know we we place
[1:00:25] all these other things but part of the
[1:00:27] adoption processes us becoming as us
[1:00:29] having all the attributes of God and
[1:00:31] becoming all that that the Lord desired
[1:00:34] for us to have and and as a as a people
[1:00:38] and actually restored back to you all
[1:00:41] that that the Ephesian Church was and
[1:00:44] those men were tough hey those men and
[1:00:49] woman were warriors and they stood in
[1:00:52] the face of adversity and they fought
[1:00:54] and that's what we are doing and we will
[1:00:56] continue to do that's that's our that's
[1:00:58] gonna be our testimony okay
[1:01:00] and yet as a Christian we have these we
[1:01:03] you know we get these other scriptures
[1:01:06] like this one it'd be possible as much
[1:01:09] as lieth and you look peaceably with all
[1:01:11] men so where you start reading these
[1:01:14] scriptures about how a Christian is
[1:01:16] and it all talks about living peaceably
[1:01:18] and being gentle in by this one behold I
[1:01:23] send you forth as sheep in the midst of
[1:01:25] wolves be easy for wires and serpents
[1:01:28] and harmless as doves and we're now as a
[1:01:30] new Christian you start you and you
[1:01:32] think hakham I'm gonna be told to be
[1:01:33] this gentle kind of guy that is like a
[1:01:35] little lamb and I don't do anything that
[1:01:37] I just you know trot around but that's
[1:01:41] not really meaning in this context right
[1:01:43] Paul says but we were gentle among you
[1:01:46] even as a nurse cheerin which into right
[1:01:49] and then Titus 3 2 this is speaking
[1:01:53] about a deacon like a big strong deacon
[1:01:57] no no to speak evil of no man to take to
[1:02:01] be no brawlers but gentle showing all
[1:02:04] meekness and to all men right so so
[1:02:08] there's there's a one part of us set to
[1:02:10] fight at this bit but then these all
[1:02:11] these other scriptures saying we're
[1:02:12] actually these gentle meek peace-loving
[1:02:15] people that you know seemingly are just
[1:02:19] weaklings and a sense in a worldly since
[1:02:21] you guys are weaklings man you've gotta
[1:02:23] have some you know tenacity to you
[1:02:25] here's another one but we were gentle
[1:02:27] among you even as a nurse to earth your
[1:02:30] children I just said that one who knows
[1:02:33] this these two men here this is um the
[1:02:37] men on the writers arm David Wilkinson
[1:02:41] and the men on the younger on the
[1:02:44] lifters are Nicky Cruz you read the
[1:02:46] story of um the cross and the
[1:02:48] Switchblade it's a I think Nicky I think
[1:02:53] Dave Wilkinson was inspired of the Lord
[1:02:55] to go and do that and he in if you read
[1:02:57] the book it's I think he was a very very
[1:03:00] um he was a godly man and he went into
[1:03:03] the the streets of New York to help out
[1:03:08] these to try and bring the gospel to
[1:03:10] these young um guys that have just
[1:03:14] formed gangs that were they were it had
[1:03:17] sort of no family in America that come
[1:03:18] from other countries and but very
[1:03:20] violent very violent very angry mean
[1:03:22] that that had lead miserable lives like
[1:03:26] Nicky Cruz's mother and father hated at
[1:03:28] least that beat him and all sort
[1:03:29] things Tilghman they just told him
[1:03:30] you'll never be nothing I hate you and
[1:03:31] so he thought well if my parents hate me
[1:03:33] then everyone hates me if I can't trust
[1:03:35] him I can't trust anyone and he just
[1:03:37] then he moved to New York and he went
[1:03:39] there mad and angry and he these men
[1:03:41] just always just start being led by
[1:03:44] Satan to door sorts of stuff and and
[1:03:46] David Wilkinson bailed on us hard to go
[1:03:48] and visit these me and it outreach to
[1:03:50] them and I think in his first visit he
[1:03:55] wanted to go and see Nicky and he just
[1:03:57] knew he told him and not and all sorts
[1:04:00] words to go away then he went back to
[1:04:01] the gang he called us to where they were
[1:04:02] I guess it was just a little pass and
[1:04:04] went to see him and on the second
[1:04:05] meeting Nicky was so angry the meat was
[1:04:07] swearing at him and cursing God and all
[1:04:09] these things and he punched them and the
[1:04:10] other guys are saying hey Nicky just
[1:04:12] leave the guy alone you know he's just
[1:04:13] coming here to say hello to you because
[1:04:15] Nick David st. and if he had just want
[1:04:18] to be your friend God loves you and he's
[1:04:19] punching him and saying go away I don't
[1:04:21] want to know you I don't want to know
[1:04:22] God all these things and I think that
[1:04:25] the other game he was about so sorry for
[1:04:27] Nicky because he was such a sort of
[1:04:28] skinny little country white guy they
[1:04:30] like hey this guy's you know he's not
[1:04:32] here to beat you up man you see probably
[1:04:34] just to help you but in the end he was
[1:04:37] converted I'm not this is not part of my
[1:04:39] sermon but I just wanted to give him
[1:04:40] some explanation of that right but that
[1:04:41] was Nicky Cruz's upbringing so so after
[1:04:45] he was converted he began doing street
[1:04:47] preaching outreaching and I guess
[1:04:50] people's perception of a Christian is
[1:04:52] that you're a weakling you know they're
[1:04:53] just this weakling goody-good you know
[1:04:55] been no we've done nothing kind of you
[1:04:58] know what I mean right
[1:04:58] and so Nicky is out reaching on the
[1:05:01] street and then people walking past them
[1:05:02] saying oh you little pansy you know one
[1:05:05] guy started mocking and making fun of
[1:05:06] him calling their little mama's boys
[1:05:08] and I think he I think the flesh
[1:05:11] must have gotten a bit upset by that and
[1:05:13] so maybe he still carried as a
[1:05:14] switchblade around because he was maybe
[1:05:16] in the process of would you yeah change
[1:05:21] like like Hamlet what do we call it
[1:05:24] sanctification right so maybe you still
[1:05:26] keep the switchblades
[1:05:27] I think his flesh overcame him at one
[1:05:30] point of his outreach and he had enough
[1:05:32] of this guy telling him it was just a
[1:05:33] net and the Annette say pulled his
[1:05:35] knife out wrestled the guy to the ground
[1:05:37] put us the knife to his throat he said
[1:05:39] if you don't commit your life to Jesus
[1:05:41] you'll be a dead man
[1:05:44] so but that's not quite how we outreach
[1:05:47] well well that's that's not what it's
[1:05:51] talking about to be a fighter but that's
[1:05:53] kind of a that was a sort of a crossover
[1:05:55] you know okay little because the Bible
[1:06:01] says we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:06:02] blood we don't wrestle against people
[1:06:06] the people not our target ever ever ever
[1:06:12] it is never ever another human being
[1:06:17] that is our target that we wrestle
[1:06:19] against ever never and anytime we get
[1:06:22] any sort of something towards another
[1:06:24] person that's anything but perfect love
[1:06:26] that's wrong any attitude any thought
[1:06:28] any desire it's absolutely wrong there's
[1:06:31] a no-go zone for a believer and no-go
[1:06:34] zone that's it
[1:06:36] you you do not come against another
[1:06:39] person the fights never against them
[1:06:41] that's who the fight is for it doesn't
[1:06:44] matter what they do to you
[1:06:45] doesn't matter how much they how much
[1:06:47] nasty things they do to you they can
[1:06:48] call you anything this that and the
[1:06:50] other thing it doesn't matter the fight
[1:06:52] is never against them ever and Jesus
[1:06:55] said when he was on the cross Father
[1:06:56] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:06:58] do the Spirit of God knows that the
[1:07:00] fight is never against another person
[1:07:02] never ever against a human being see I
[1:07:05] flee sometimes I'll get okay
[1:07:09] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:07:11] blood but against principalities against
[1:07:12] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[1:07:14] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:07:15] in high places that's what we wrestle
[1:07:18] against then unfortunately those things
[1:07:20] can come upon people and cause them to
[1:07:22] do things but it's never the person that
[1:07:23] does it
[1:07:24] it's never the person that does it it's
[1:07:26] it's always whatever's come upon them
[1:07:28] that make them do that it's always there
[1:07:30] and now we have to keep that in mind
[1:07:32] otherwise we can get upset with things
[1:07:35] when we shouldn't ever get upset with
[1:07:36] things that's not a true warrior it's
[1:07:39] we're going to be fighting in the wrong
[1:07:41] place if we do that now I've got this
[1:07:44] little diagram because you talk about
[1:07:46] war fighting an order for there to be a
[1:07:50] fight
[1:07:50] or some sort of conflict you have to
[1:07:53] essentially have one thing
[1:07:56] and two people want the same thing
[1:07:58] basically all these different opinions
[1:08:00] on how that things should be there has
[1:08:02] to be some sort of conflict in this case
[1:08:04] say a war one country wants that place
[1:08:07] and then the people that veer generally
[1:08:09] say no we want to keep this place and so
[1:08:11] they have a disagreement and they they
[1:08:14] if they've both got courage enough and
[1:08:17] them they both fight have a fight over
[1:08:18] you know the certain particular area I
[1:08:21] know this is basic stuff but this is
[1:08:23] this is conflict right this is this is
[1:08:25] what we this is conflict this is how
[1:08:27] human beings work all this nonsense will
[1:08:30] be over when it's all done but this is
[1:08:31] currently how this stuff works but we
[1:08:34] all do this I thought this one up here
[1:08:36] as well right this starts from when you
[1:08:39] were very very small hey and there's
[1:08:42] like ten balloons and there's two
[1:08:45] children it but they both want the green
[1:08:48] balloon hey there's another green
[1:08:51] balloon there but they want that green
[1:08:52] balloon in there hey and they and they
[1:08:56] both want it so they fight over it they
[1:08:58] fight fight for this green balloon
[1:09:00] you've done their day but the Bible says
[1:09:05] when we grow up we put off childish
[1:09:07] things and that means fighting and
[1:09:09] disputing a maxi shadow and all those
[1:09:10] things those are childish things right
[1:09:12] you know this is this is the this is the
[1:09:14] carnal nature and its purest form you
[1:09:17] know fight over everything he took that
[1:09:19] I want that back you know it's no
[1:09:20] restraint to how we act when we get the
[1:09:23] Spirit of God the spirit of God can
[1:09:25] restrain how we act because we act
[1:09:27] through the Spirit of God rather than
[1:09:29] through our carnal nature we say you
[1:09:31] keep that balloon you know what you have
[1:09:33] all the balloons there ever Rose you can
[1:09:35] keep them all you know what does it
[1:09:38] matter
[1:09:38] live peaceably with all men we start to
[1:09:41] understand these ways we can live our
[1:09:42] life to actually let God be in control
[1:09:44] rather than us we try and control
[1:09:45] situations so much and think we've got
[1:09:47] it we've got act here and make it work
[1:09:49] for our benefit we don't have to do that
[1:09:51] that's our flesh the more we trust in
[1:09:53] God we realize we can just you can just
[1:09:56] give up let God do it guys a far better
[1:09:58] man of war than we are and within those
[1:10:01] things right now here's a here's a
[1:10:06] little diagram about us an hour an hour
[1:10:09] life before crisis this is what it looks
[1:10:12] like we're in the enemy's camp we're
[1:10:14] serving Satan we just as brother branham
[1:10:17] Synod I've got a quote with slouching
[1:10:18] there were just sitting around you know
[1:10:20] and we're just going with the flow we
[1:10:23] actually don't have any fight in us
[1:10:25] people people in the state that think
[1:10:28] they're strong a mistaken yes and I care
[1:10:31] what your body looks like that key how
[1:10:32] many guys you can think you can beat up
[1:10:34] we're mistaken we're not strong we're
[1:10:36] going with the flow we're weaklings
[1:10:37] we're just going with whatever
[1:10:38] there's no restraint there's no fight
[1:10:41] really a there's no fight in this state
[1:10:44] can we just sit back right okay let this
[1:10:47] this that's weak to me that's not it's
[1:10:50] not strong you don't have to fight
[1:10:52] anything in that state for someone's
[1:10:55] fighting for you when we're in that
[1:10:58] state God's fighting for us unbeknownst
[1:11:00] to us he's actually fighting for us to
[1:11:03] get us we when we don't even really want
[1:11:06] it he's fighting for us and it's
[1:11:08] actually our job as Christians to fight
[1:11:10] brothers when they don't even want it
[1:11:11] that's what Jesus did he fought for us
[1:11:14] Father forgive them they know not what
[1:11:16] they do okay so now now we have this
[1:11:20] conversion of me so I'm going to serve
[1:11:22] the Lord I don't want to serve Satan
[1:11:23] anymore I don't want to be in his
[1:11:24] kingdom I want to serve the Lord we
[1:11:26] switch camps and then a wee bit of
[1:11:29] trouble starts after that for us because
[1:11:32] suddenly we're sun-soaked on or he's
[1:11:34] change sides
[1:11:35] or his he oh that's how it is is it and
[1:11:41] if you know Satan he's so predictable
[1:11:44] yes because he can't help hating he
[1:11:47] can't help getting back at you he just
[1:11:50] that's why that's why God can play him
[1:11:53] like a fool every time because he can't
[1:11:55] help just he has to act in a in an evil
[1:11:58] way all the time he can't do you
[1:12:01] understand what I mean he's so he's so
[1:12:02] predictable and that's why worldly
[1:12:06] people can can get but the Bible says
[1:12:09] that the children of this world are a
[1:12:12] neared a wiser than the children of
[1:12:13] light in terms of worldly activities
[1:12:15] because when you think evil you think
[1:12:17] okay that guy's going to act like this
[1:12:19] avoid Esther to him here like like that
[1:12:20] towards me so then I've been to do this
[1:12:21] to counter that
[1:12:22] right and it's all that's all you can
[1:12:25] predict how the carnal nature will act
[1:12:26] that's why when they come across a
[1:12:28] Christian that excellent so the X
[1:12:30] differently they think well this is odd
[1:12:31] he hasn't responded the way that they
[1:12:34] should usually respond what's happening
[1:12:35] here this is different you understand
[1:12:38] but that's the way but the cattle so
[1:12:41] Satan is he can't help boasting he can't
[1:12:43] help hoping he can't help doing all
[1:12:45] these things it's just how he works he's
[1:12:47] pretty predictable that's why I'm there
[1:12:49] he always has to have symbols and things
[1:12:51] and all of it and there's rock stars
[1:12:53] always have to be in it he has symbols
[1:12:55] all over his pictures and everything
[1:12:56] just to show that this is me you know
[1:12:58] you can't just thought it's a shot to me
[1:13:00] that's not what I'm speaking about but
[1:13:03] so but now you have it you have a small
[1:13:06] problem in this situation still you've
[1:13:11] got an enemy that you just came out of
[1:13:12] the Satan's camp so he's upset with you
[1:13:14] but you've also got this carnal nature
[1:13:16] that actually is still within you right
[1:13:20] that that that actually still doesn't
[1:13:24] like it doesn't like this new sitting it
[1:13:27] doesn't like the new setting that you're
[1:13:29] in and the truth be known it never ever
[1:13:32] ever will like the new sitting listen
[1:13:33] right never it's never going to be happy
[1:13:35] there it's never ever going to be
[1:13:38] satisfied it's never going to say you
[1:13:39] know what it's been years and years
[1:13:40] you've been here for so long let's just
[1:13:42] accept it as the winners be happy I'll
[1:13:44] never bother you anymore I'm content
[1:13:46] that hey you've won I give up
[1:13:49] it is never ever ever going to do that
[1:13:52] to you I'm never gonna say that to you
[1:13:54] it's gonna fight you
[1:13:56] as long as you're in that camp as long
[1:13:58] as you're there it's going to fight you
[1:13:59] every single day you talk about a fight
[1:14:01] you've got a you've got you've got the
[1:14:04] cyber Kingdom upset with you that you've
[1:14:06] left them so they're fighting against
[1:14:08] you then you've got this thing inside
[1:14:09] you on top of that it's also five
[1:14:11] minutes then you stand that you took and
[1:14:14] and then just one more thing if you
[1:14:17] actually decide to you know what I'm
[1:14:19] actually going to fight against his
[1:14:20] kingdom - and try and bring out the
[1:14:22] people where I am then you're really in
[1:14:24] trouble and your whole life from this
[1:14:28] point onwards is basically going to be a
[1:14:30] constant constant fight constantly from
[1:14:34] all sides
[1:14:35] there is never going to be any risk ever
[1:14:37] I don't want to make bit Sun bleak but I
[1:14:41] want to make that reality right now the
[1:14:43] Lord gives us three sativa fishes us but
[1:14:45] we that comes into it but in terms of
[1:14:48] the state that we run there will never
[1:14:50] be rest it will never be there will
[1:14:53] never be a day with the enemy goes leave
[1:14:54] them alone
[1:14:55] you know during not so much now but when
[1:14:59] men had more morals and values than
[1:15:00] meant men were that they you know had
[1:15:05] more more more morals within them during
[1:15:09] like the head rules of war that okay in
[1:15:12] this situation you don't do this you
[1:15:13] don't do that you don't do that or they
[1:15:15] would say you know they'll be fighting
[1:15:18] in World War one and they would say look
[1:15:19] you know there are so many few bodies
[1:15:20] and no man's then here let's say let's
[1:15:23] just have a couple of days of peace and
[1:15:24] we're going get all that did people bury
[1:15:26] them and then we'll carry on fighting
[1:15:27] yes we'll agree to that and they would
[1:15:29] go and do it no they would have
[1:15:31] agreements that enemies would decide
[1:15:33] little agreements and they would stick
[1:15:34] to them but these days that doesn't
[1:15:37] quite happen you know they'll say oh
[1:15:38] yeah we'll do that and then it's a truck
[1:15:40] to get you out there than they shoot you
[1:15:41] all you know but the devil what you
[1:15:43] can't make agreements with them he won't
[1:15:44] just say oh let's just make this
[1:15:45] agreement he's always fighting against
[1:15:47] us so so now in this situation here this
[1:15:52] is now you and I because we are all now
[1:15:55] in the New Kingdom
[1:15:57] we've decided to follow the Lord and
[1:15:59] where you're actually pursuing Satan's
[1:16:01] Kingdom that's why we come here that's
[1:16:02] why we fight for the Lord so this is us
[1:16:04] right you we're all reserved to that
[1:16:05] fact that our whole life from today
[1:16:08] onwards or whenever it was there's going
[1:16:10] to be a constant fight that's why Paul
[1:16:13] said fight the good fight of faith
[1:16:14] now we're and women get reserved to that
[1:16:17] we kind of accept it and go yeah let's
[1:16:19] do this
[1:16:20] okay this is the scripture here that
[1:16:23] shows because the carnal man is enmity
[1:16:26] against God for he is not subject to the
[1:16:28] law of man neither indeed can be right
[1:16:30] this is little black guy I showed you
[1:16:32] right it's imminent he against God
[1:16:34] unfortunately he sticks around but he's
[1:16:36] enmity that means he's hates it
[1:16:39] they cannot coexist together and yet
[1:16:42] they had somehow I have to right
[1:16:44] now there's only one solution for the
[1:16:49] carnal men there's only one solution for
[1:16:51] the carnal man and it's not seven steps
[1:16:54] how to train the carnal man or how to
[1:16:56] cooperate with the carnal man there's
[1:16:58] only one solution to the carnal man and
[1:17:05] every man that striveth for the mastery
[1:17:06] as temper and all things now they do it
[1:17:09] to obtain a corruptible crown but we an
[1:17:11] incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[1:17:14] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[1:17:16] beateth the year but I keep my body and
[1:17:19] bring it under subjection less therefore
[1:17:22] any means when i have preached to others
[1:17:23] i myself should be a castaway there's
[1:17:27] only one method to control the carnal
[1:17:29] man and that's this word subjection
[1:17:31] right bring it under subjection it means
[1:17:35] I'm gonna fight against you and beat you
[1:17:36] down I'm gonna beat you down and I'm
[1:17:39] gonna keep you under subjection all the
[1:17:41] time yeah I'm gonna constantly fight
[1:17:43] against you and I'm going to win and
[1:17:45] you're gonna be beating down daily have
[1:17:47] I got that scripture there yeah that's
[1:17:49] well that's why Paul says I protest why
[1:17:51] you rejoice so much I have in Christ
[1:17:53] Jesus our Lord I die daily now Paul is
[1:17:55] alive every day but he's saying that the
[1:17:58] flesh man dies daily the spirit man
[1:18:01] beats them down beats them up and the
[1:18:03] man is the life to Christ lives now now
[1:18:08] we say praise the Lord which we should
[1:18:10] but it's not as easy as that right hey
[1:18:14] it's not like oh this is just an easy
[1:18:16] fight it's a fight and if you lit up and
[1:18:18] now I just relax for a couple of days
[1:18:19] what happens the sky gets a little bit
[1:18:22] stronger comes back at you suddenly you
[1:18:25] might do something you didn't want to do
[1:18:26] you think ah and then Satan comes at you
[1:18:28] and says I see you you're not really as
[1:18:30] good as what you thought you were and
[1:18:31] then you can even feel even worse and
[1:18:33] it's a fight fight fight when you're
[1:18:36] walking in the spirit you don't fulfill
[1:18:37] those lusts of the flesh that's what the
[1:18:38] Bible says walk in the spirit
[1:18:40] you won't fulfill the lusts of the flesh
[1:18:41] but you know when we might overwork
[1:18:43] ourselves or do too you know our brave
[1:18:46] we might get caught up in things and
[1:18:48] then it's yeah we don't walk in the
[1:18:51] spirit as much we don't tend to the
[1:18:52] things of God as much we don't drink
[1:18:54] enough water right we get a headache
[1:18:56] Hey and then I mean these things that
[1:19:00] but it's a constant fight now don't feel
[1:19:02] bad if sometimes this guy ones it's not
[1:19:06] you that like we said the other day that
[1:19:09] man has an expiry date
[1:19:11] he's got an expiry date he's not going
[1:19:13] to be around forever he's got an expiry
[1:19:15] date so anything he does
[1:19:18] Satan's gonna actually pay for anyway
[1:19:21] anything that he does I want to read you
[1:19:27] some quotes from brother Branham just to
[1:19:29] talk about what I've just spoken about
[1:19:31] is it possible for a Holy Ghost person
[1:19:34] to be driven driven by or to do minor
[1:19:38] things influenced to do minor things
[1:19:39] that he doesn't want to do
[1:19:41] oh yes yes sir yeah a Holy Ghost fell
[1:19:45] person you're right in the place then to
[1:19:47] be to be drove by those things you just
[1:19:49] put yourself up a target when you're
[1:19:51] down there serving the devil he just
[1:19:53] lets you slouch around any way you want
[1:19:55] but you once take a stand for Christ
[1:19:58] you've got on the other side then he
[1:20:00] trains every gun right around on you
[1:20:02] every temptation everything that could
[1:20:04] be throwed to you then you got it but
[1:20:11] what have we got greater is He that is
[1:20:13] in you than he that is in the world see
[1:20:14] there wasn't and no battle here you was
[1:20:17] just slopping around hay slopping around
[1:20:21] but now you've cleaned up you've dressed
[1:20:24] up you've shaved you've combed you here
[1:20:26] you've put on a uniform you've got a gun
[1:20:28] in your hand let's go see you're in
[1:20:30] battle not to show off but to fight
[1:20:32] fight sure when the temptations arise
[1:20:35] with the spirit the shield of faith buck
[1:20:38] it off and move on see this right I put
[1:20:40] all put all the whole armour of God why
[1:20:43] do you put on an armor if you're not
[1:20:45] going to fight all soldiers address to
[1:20:47] fight not to show off walk out and say
[1:20:49] then you all can't say I'm some so now
[1:20:51] I'm a Christian see who am I belonged to
[1:20:53] science Oh hallelujah I got the Holy
[1:20:58] Ghost the other night sure nothing
[1:21:00] bothers me anymore but he's speaking
[1:21:02] sarcastically oh brother
[1:21:04] I believe you better go back and try
[1:21:06] again see
[1:21:07] I'm telling you when as soon as you say
[1:21:09] you got the Holy Ghost Satan's got every
[1:21:11] gun on you shooting you then you've got
[1:21:14] the whole armor on
[1:21:15] then take the shield of faith the sword
[1:21:16] of the Spirit or the word and take the
[1:21:18] buckle on and show yourself with the
[1:21:20] gospel and take the old middle piece
[1:21:22] here and breastplate and pull it up pull
[1:21:24] up the clinch on it and tighten yourself
[1:21:26] up a little bit and get ready for it
[1:21:28] because it's coming
[1:21:29] don't you worry yes sir you're going to
[1:21:32] have plenty of trouble plenty of trouble
[1:21:35] but remember greater is He that's in you
[1:21:38] than he that's in the world where our
[1:21:40] victorious people I like people with
[1:21:43] courage I don't I'll leave it no I'll
[1:21:49] say it as a as human thinking is
[1:21:53] something that I've perceived because
[1:21:55] I'm not political whatsoever I don't
[1:21:57] agree in political stuff I agree in the
[1:22:00] kingdom of God but what has taken what
[1:22:04] what is what people have gotten all
[1:22:05] happy about Trump is is that he's got
[1:22:08] fight in him that's what they like about
[1:22:10] it man this guy's got fight he can fight
[1:22:12] back and it's made people realize we can
[1:22:14] fight back people like someone that
[1:22:18] fights back you know that was parish
[1:22:21] brother Brennan was a fighter he fought
[1:22:24] back he fought back and that's who we
[1:22:26] are we fight back but we just got to
[1:22:30] fight for the right things we can fight
[1:22:33] our whole life for something that's in
[1:22:34] the vein imagine that putting all your
[1:22:36] energy into something that's a complete
[1:22:38] that's what waste of time is spending
[1:22:39] all your energy onto it I'm so glad that
[1:22:41] we can fight for the kingdom of God and
[1:22:44] for his word that's all I want to fight
[1:22:47] for because I'm tired of investing my
[1:22:49] fight in my life and do things that are
[1:22:51] temporal in that waste time and that
[1:22:53] don't come to anything i'ma fight for
[1:22:55] things that are gold and silver so when
[1:22:56] it's all been said and done when the
[1:22:58] when it always laid out that was gold
[1:23:00] that your fought for there that was
[1:23:01] silver and I've want to turn up with hay
[1:23:05] in the fire burns and it's gone all that
[1:23:07] was a waste of time wasn't it
[1:23:09] i'ma fight for things if they're eternal
[1:23:12] I'm gonna read you something from Acts
[1:23:14] about the disciples and they came
[1:23:17] certain that came to the certain Jews
[1:23:19] from Antioch and Iconium who persuaded
[1:23:22] the people and having stoned Paul drew
[1:23:25] him out of the city supposing he had
[1:23:27] been dead how bad as the disciples stood
[1:23:30] around him he rose up and came to the
[1:23:32] city and the next day he departed with
[1:23:34] Barnabas to Derby and we need to preach
[1:23:37] the gospel to that city in a taut many
[1:23:38] they returned to Lystra and to Iconium
[1:23:40] and Antioch confirming the souls of the
[1:23:43] disciples and exhorting them to continue
[1:23:44] in the faith and that we must through
[1:23:47] much tribulation enter into the kingdom
[1:23:50] of God so this was a general idea of
[1:23:52] monks them and when they had ordained
[1:23:54] elders in every Church and it prayed
[1:23:56] with fasting they committed them to the
[1:23:57] Lord on whom they believed so Paul's
[1:24:00] just finished being stoned he comes back
[1:24:01] at Elsinore with much tribulation you'll
[1:24:03] enter into the kingdom of God this is
[1:24:05] how it's going to be for you guys I'm
[1:24:08] going to speak about Paul for a little
[1:24:09] bit this is from Galatians and Paul says
[1:24:13] from henceforth let no man trouble me
[1:24:16] for my beer in my body the marks of the
[1:24:18] Lord Jesus and we know that different
[1:24:21] callings that we have the Lord puts us
[1:24:24] through different things different
[1:24:26] levels for the different callings that
[1:24:27] we have now I would have liked Paul was
[1:24:30] calling Paul is calling didn't allow him
[1:24:32] just to have an easy life and here you
[1:24:34] go in the same with brother branham's
[1:24:35] nonetheless it's something that we can
[1:24:37] look to I've got a few scriptures here
[1:24:41] Paul says are they ministers of Christ I
[1:24:43] speak as a fool I am more an Labour's
[1:24:45] more abundant in stripes above measure
[1:24:49] in prisons more frequent and deaths oft
[1:24:54] of the Jews five times received I forty
[1:24:59] stripes save one thrice was i beaten
[1:25:03] with rods once was i stoned
[1:25:13] thrice I chef I suffered shipwreck a
[1:25:16] night in the day have I been in the deep
[1:25:20] this is not because he was going on a
[1:25:22] holiday this is to spread the gospel and
[1:25:29] journeys often Imperials of waters
[1:25:33] Imperials of robbers and perils by mine
[1:25:36] own countrymen and perils by the heathen
[1:25:39] Imperials in the city Imperials and the
[1:25:41] wilderness and perils in the sea
[1:25:46] Imperials amongst false brethren and
[1:25:48] weariness and painfulness in watchings
[1:25:51] often in hunger and thirst and fastings
[1:25:55] often in cold and nakedness beside those
[1:26:00] things which are without that which
[1:26:02] cometh upon me daily the care of all the
[1:26:04] churches paul was fighting a lot of
[1:26:07] battles and he fought every single day
[1:26:11] that's what we are called to do as well
[1:26:18] and paul says and now behold I go bound
[1:26:20] in the spirit unto Jerusalem not known
[1:26:22] to think that shall before me there save
[1:26:24] that the whole ghost witnesseth and
[1:26:26] every city saying that bonds in
[1:26:27] afflictions abide me and I like this
[1:26:29] verse but none of these things move me
[1:26:34] none of these things move me and that's
[1:26:37] the attitude we should have as a
[1:26:38] Christian come what may
[1:26:40] bring it on hey none of these things
[1:26:45] move me neither count on my life dear
[1:26:48] unto myself so that I might finish my
[1:26:49] course with joy and the Ministry which
[1:26:52] I've received over the Lord to testify
[1:26:54] the gospel of the grace of God it's how
[1:26:57] we want to go out brethren none of these
[1:27:00] things move me I'm going to finish my
[1:27:01] course
[1:27:07] now back to what I was talking about
[1:27:08] before so Paul's going through all this
[1:27:10] right baby gets back to the Corinthian
[1:27:12] church and and he hears things about the
[1:27:16] Corinthians and he's battling battling
[1:27:18] all these things and then he hears back
[1:27:20] a report and it's and then he says he
[1:27:27] hears about all the disputing and the
[1:27:29] fussing going on right I think from his
[1:27:33] perspective he's out there he's being
[1:27:35] shipwrecked he's been stoned he's trying
[1:27:37] to preach the word he's got perils among
[1:27:38] false brethren he's got all these things
[1:27:40] and then he hears of these Christian
[1:27:43] guys that are just arguing and fussing
[1:27:44] amongst themselves you know if you're a
[1:27:48] friend of him like a acquaintance in
[1:27:50] terms of he could talk candidly to you
[1:27:52] he'd probably say that bunch of babies
[1:27:54] hey look at them look at this look at
[1:27:59] the wool we're trying to fight brother
[1:28:00] than these brothers here just fussing
[1:28:02] and arguing amongst themselves caring on
[1:28:06] really yeah that's that was that that's
[1:28:08] what you'd be that's what he'd be
[1:28:10] thinking and comp in the context of the
[1:28:11] battle that there is and these guys are
[1:28:12] battling amongst each other and he said
[1:28:14] imported for are you yet carnal for it
[1:28:18] whereas among you there is envying and
[1:28:19] strife and divisions are ye not carnal
[1:28:22] and walkers min he's saying you're not
[1:28:24] really being real soldiers you're just
[1:28:26] busting around and what it means but a
[1:28:31] carnal and Walker's men where does all
[1:28:33] about disputes come from they come from
[1:28:37] there they come from the carnal man
[1:28:39] that's in us how they don't come from
[1:28:42] the spirit man the spirit man that sent
[1:28:45] us doesn't have the ability to hold a
[1:28:47] grudge it doesn't have the ability to
[1:28:51] get offended it cannot get offended it
[1:28:55] doesn't have the ability to not like you
[1:28:57] to what you get back at you to harm you
[1:29:00] it does not you think about it it does
[1:29:02] not have that ability within itself that
[1:29:05] the most testing that it got was when it
[1:29:07] was put upon a cross and it was tested
[1:29:10] and and spat upon and all these things
[1:29:13] that this spirit of god was tested and
[1:29:15] yet what was this end result Father
[1:29:16] forgive them you know how what they do
[1:29:18] today that's that's how far the spirit
[1:29:21] can go and still not fight back against
[1:29:23] other humans against and do anything
[1:29:27] like that so all of this stuff here that
[1:29:29] these guys were doing was from the was
[1:29:32] because they were living the carnal man
[1:29:33] act and do things because this is not
[1:29:36] from the Spirit of God and and that
[1:29:39] comes from not standing on our standing
[1:29:42] our ground and fighting and fighting
[1:29:44] this thing down I die daily
[1:29:46] getting that flesh under control that's
[1:29:48] our that's part of our job as a soldier
[1:29:50] keep your land under control keep that
[1:29:53] going to control we've got a we've got a
[1:29:55] part of the fence that we've all that
[1:29:57] we've got to stand and hold and it's our
[1:30:00] walls you know if we let our wall down
[1:30:03] we start leaving the enemy comes through
[1:30:05] us we start getting carnal we affect
[1:30:07] other people through our carnality we
[1:30:09] start having these little disputes I
[1:30:11] can't fight your battle for you as much
[1:30:13] as I'd like to be your burdens I can't
[1:30:15] be I can't fight your battle for you you
[1:30:17] have to fight your battle and if you
[1:30:19] don't and if we don't then we end up
[1:30:21] like this and we get disputing and all
[1:30:23] these sorts of things but perfect love
[1:30:25] is not like this James says as well from
[1:30:28] whence cometh Wars and Fighting's among
[1:30:30] you came they not hence even of your
[1:30:32] lusts that war in your members doesn't
[1:30:34] come from God it doesn't come from the
[1:30:36] new life that's in you it comes from
[1:30:37] their lust in our members if we let that
[1:30:39] thing work and have it have it not be
[1:30:42] beaten down not bring it under
[1:30:43] subjection this is what's going to
[1:30:45] happen but now our job as a Christian as
[1:30:49] if you perceive that amongst an another
[1:30:51] brother or a sister you know that's not
[1:30:53] them it's not them don't even act on
[1:30:56] don't respond don't get something to it
[1:30:59] and respond in a carnal way it's even
[1:31:01] worse act in a spiritual way it's never
[1:31:04] a person you understand right so so now
[1:31:09] this picture here that that Spirit of
[1:31:13] God and us does not have the ability to
[1:31:15] get upset doesn't have the ability to
[1:31:18] get offended you know those days of
[1:31:20] getting offended and being it actually
[1:31:22] doesn't have the ability to be hurt you
[1:31:24] know that the Spirit of God does not
[1:31:27] have the ability to get hurt
[1:31:30] it can be it can feel burdened but not
[1:31:32] to be heard in terms of I'm gonna I need
[1:31:34] to get back at you for this doesn't have
[1:31:36] the ability you know people have little
[1:31:39] disputes and fellowships and they're all
[1:31:40] upset about things and arm hmm
[1:31:42] it's that's not since it's not a real
[1:31:46] soldier that's not someone that's fought
[1:31:47] their flesh and got it done it's not
[1:31:50] since I didn't break it to you so
[1:31:51] abruptly but that's nonsense
[1:31:54] it's not the way that we should be as
[1:31:56] believers it's not our portion the if we
[1:31:59] want to be like I'll restore me back to
[1:32:01] what the head in the book of X that's
[1:32:02] what the head I die daily I'm not gonna
[1:32:04] let this carnal guy come and act and do
[1:32:06] things it's this how that's the way that
[1:32:10] a believer is that's what we've being
[1:32:11] restored back to you we want the spoken
[1:32:13] word and that this is part of it this is
[1:32:15] what we have that the Spirit of God
[1:32:18] doesn't have the ability to be not
[1:32:21] long-suffering because it says charity
[1:32:23] which is actually just the love which is
[1:32:25] the life of God because God is love
[1:32:27] charity is a gap a gap oh okay the word
[1:32:33] when I'm not Greek I'm not going to put
[1:32:34] in that I am right that's that's the
[1:32:37] life of God when it comes in us God is
[1:32:40] love and that this scripture in first
[1:32:42] Corinthians explains this is how God
[1:32:44] acts so charity suffers long suffers
[1:32:48] long so when we used to side I'm done
[1:32:51] with that person
[1:32:52] I bet enough that's not charity that's
[1:32:55] not this that's not speaking from that
[1:32:56] net Spirit of God they're speaking from
[1:32:58] this other carnal man about enough God's
[1:33:03] never done with it he's never done with
[1:33:06] it it's the way it is it's kind kind
[1:33:11] it's always kind no matter what happens
[1:33:14] it's always kind you did this to me I'll
[1:33:16] do this to you but if you do that to me
[1:33:17] I'll do this to you doesn't work like
[1:33:19] that it's always kind it's always it's
[1:33:22] it doesn't it's not overcome with evil
[1:33:24] it overcomes evil with good it doesn't
[1:33:27] Envy oh they got the position and the
[1:33:30] church that I wanted what come on men it
[1:33:35] doesn't care
[1:33:36] your your beer awesome
[1:33:40] that's fantastic you enjoy that that's
[1:33:42] fantastic man you're you're better off
[1:33:45] because of that awesome I'm thrilled
[1:33:49] let's work the way the Spirit of God
[1:33:51] acts is what this not itself
[1:33:54] it's like boastful it's not puffed up
[1:33:57] doesn't think it's anything great it's
[1:34:01] not easily provoked flesh manga is
[1:34:04] provoked quite easily especially when
[1:34:05] you get tired but the spirit man is not
[1:34:09] easily provoked you can't get them all
[1:34:12] stirred up he's not easily provoked
[1:34:15] seeketh not her own it's not gonna read
[1:34:19] here sorry does not behave itself
[1:34:23] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:34:25] easily provoked thinks no evil rejoices
[1:34:27] not an iniquity see all this nonsense
[1:34:30] about God is love at least we do
[1:34:31] whatever I want
[1:34:32] that's not love because love doesn't
[1:34:34] rejoice in iniquity love love can never
[1:34:38] ever ever accept something that's wrong
[1:34:40] it doesn't have the ability to it can't
[1:34:42] say yes like okay I accept it after all
[1:34:45] these years I'll accept it doesn't have
[1:34:46] the ability to accept and liquidy
[1:34:49] it's like and this is this is something
[1:34:53] that you face when you're when you're a
[1:34:54] parent but you know I've had to say -
[1:34:58] I've had to make a declaration to my
[1:35:00] children I'm only ever going to accept
[1:35:03] God and a life that's surrendered to God
[1:35:06] like bring forth those fruits I'll
[1:35:08] accept you but but I'm not going to
[1:35:11] accept something that I can't accept
[1:35:13] iniquity as long as if you go down that
[1:35:17] road ever I can't um I will not go down
[1:35:20] that road with you that's not because I
[1:35:22] don't like you but there's something in
[1:35:23] me that won't just go okay let's just
[1:35:24] yes we have you with that now I won't
[1:35:27] even be happy with it
[1:35:28] hey I haven't been happy with it for a
[1:35:31] long time I will never be happy with it
[1:35:32] I'm not going to go down that road it's
[1:35:34] going to be a constant conflict if
[1:35:35] that's the way you want to go to be a
[1:35:36] conflict because I'm that I can't
[1:35:39] rejoice the net I can't go there with
[1:35:41] you and it's not that I don't like you
[1:35:43] it's just I don't like that rejoice it's
[1:35:46] not an iniquity but rejoices and truth
[1:35:50] and I like this one Bharath all things
[1:35:54] here's all things to me that's strong
[1:35:57] believes all things hopes all things
[1:36:00] endures all things
[1:36:03] it can enjoy anything you might go
[1:36:05] through anything in your life regardless
[1:36:08] of how hard it might seem this love of
[1:36:11] God this life that sin you will endure
[1:36:13] it that's what we have is Christians
[1:36:17] they are therefore endure hardness as a
[1:36:20] good soldier of Christ we've got to be
[1:36:24] tough people let's that's we've got to
[1:36:28] be we've got to have that within us we
[1:36:29] can't be just soft this world has made
[1:36:34] us so soft so many conveniences and
[1:36:36] everything we just get everything nice
[1:36:37] and easy it's made us soft but you know
[1:36:41] as a Christian Paul says and joy to
[1:36:43] Timothy endure hardness I wonder what
[1:36:46] their boots meet because sometimes we
[1:36:48] can the King James can sort of we can't
[1:36:52] quite get it sometimes but REI got a few
[1:36:54] other different versions just to see if
[1:36:55] I was on the right track join with me in
[1:36:57] suffering like a good soldier of Christ
[1:37:00] Jesus and your suffering along with me
[1:37:02] as a good soldier of Christ Jesus shear
[1:37:04] and suffering as a good soldier of
[1:37:05] Christ Jesus suffer hardship with me as
[1:37:08] a good soldier of Christ Jesus there are
[1:37:10] therefore endure hardness as a good
[1:37:12] soldier of Jesus Christ as a good
[1:37:14] soldier of Christ Jesus you must enjoy
[1:37:16] your share of suffering take your part
[1:37:19] and suffering as a loyal soldier of
[1:37:21] Christ take your share of suffering as a
[1:37:23] good soldier of Christ Jesus you must
[1:37:26] therefore share in hardship as a good
[1:37:28] soldier of Christ Jesus you therefore
[1:37:30] and your hardness as a good soldier of
[1:37:32] Christ it all pretty much says the same
[1:37:34] thing telling us the walk is not going
[1:37:37] to be easy and we've got to accept that
[1:37:39] it's gonna be tough it's gonna be hard
[1:37:41] and we've got to endure it I mean they
[1:37:43] have that endurance of the in shall be
[1:37:44] safe now I'm not talking about our our
[1:37:46] our you know it's gonna be by my works
[1:37:48] but I'm just saying when we take on this
[1:37:50] attitude then we can fight a bit easier
[1:37:52] you know when I didn't have this
[1:37:54] attitude I used to get down about things
[1:37:55] are so hard why is there to be so hard
[1:37:57] all the time you know and that would
[1:37:58] would get me down till one day I
[1:38:00] understood this is just a fight man
[1:38:02] get used to it stop fighting back amen
[1:38:05] fight back don't just just one thing and
[1:38:08] when you don't feel like it fight back
[1:38:10] again and when you get booted down on
[1:38:12] the ground and you fail I wrote a silly
[1:38:15] song with song one so that the chorus is
[1:38:17] that all you've got people don't know
[1:38:19] what it means but I know what it means
[1:38:20] and I liken myself you know sometimes
[1:38:23] you know you might get beaten down
[1:38:25] you're on the ground and you Satan's
[1:38:27] kind of all it's got you down and then
[1:38:28] you can barely open your eyes cuz your
[1:38:30] eyes all black you've been beaten up and
[1:38:32] then you say is that all you've got
[1:38:35] hey you know bring it on
[1:38:42] when Satan can't actually get you to say
[1:38:45] I give up I and go at his side he hates
[1:38:48] it you can mess with you any way he
[1:38:50] wants to but he cannot actually ever get
[1:38:52] you you'll never go yes I give up you
[1:38:55] might actually be mean you say no I
[1:38:56] didn't mean that I'm not and your time
[1:39:00] of weakness it was a man called um
[1:39:03] Thomas but he was a um it like an
[1:39:06] Anglican priest and 1600s and he wasn't
[1:39:12] happy with the I guess ministering under
[1:39:16] that situation with just in the Anglican
[1:39:18] Church and how they were doing it and I
[1:39:20] think you wanted more liberty to just be
[1:39:22] able to preach the gospel and do what he
[1:39:23] wanted to do and and the restraints of
[1:39:25] the Anglican Church were start it's a
[1:39:27] really way on him but in those times the
[1:39:30] you know these tutors are quite powerful
[1:39:31] and I guess they paid as loving and all
[1:39:33] those sorts of things and and he was he
[1:39:35] was facing this battle off you know do I
[1:39:37] do I I really want to just serve the
[1:39:41] Lord but there's going to be a price for
[1:39:42] me to pay if I just tell these guys I'm
[1:39:44] gone because he wanted to leave that and
[1:39:45] just start a little under pendant Church
[1:39:46] and just be able to preach the gospel
[1:39:47] and and see the Spirit of God moved that
[1:39:50] was his desire but he knew in order to
[1:39:52] do that here to pay a price it was going
[1:39:53] to cost him something and and I'm around
[1:39:59] the same time - he was he was reading
[1:40:01] about Peter the history about Peter so
[1:40:05] this is Simon Peter the Apostle Peter
[1:40:06] and and most of the disciples were
[1:40:10] crucified or stoned in some way but
[1:40:13] but history different accounts from
[1:40:16] history say that of Peter when they were
[1:40:18] going to crucify him
[1:40:20] Peter said don't crucify me upright
[1:40:24] because that's the way they crucified
[1:40:25] the Lord I'm not worthy to be crucified
[1:40:26] like that crucifying me upside down so
[1:40:28] they crucified him upside down that's
[1:40:32] that's what history tells us and and so
[1:40:36] this man I'm Thomas Shepherd is I guess
[1:40:40] he's got that on his mind and he's
[1:40:41] thinking about look I paying a price to
[1:40:44] leave the church and he's thinking about
[1:40:47] taking up his cross and then I don't
[1:40:49] know if you can see this but he wrote a
[1:40:50] song and this is actually the first song
[1:40:52] that he wrote and it says my Simon bear
[1:40:56] the cross alone in all the world go free
[1:40:58] no there's a cross for everyone and
[1:41:01] there's a cross for me how happy are the
[1:41:03] Saints above who once went mourning here
[1:41:05] but now they tasted mingled love and joy
[1:41:07] without a tear will bear the consecrated
[1:41:09] cross till from the cross we're free
[1:41:11] then go home our crowns - wherefore
[1:41:13] there's a cross for me there was the
[1:41:17] original version of the song it changed
[1:41:20] over the years but the original version
[1:41:22] was must Simon bear his cross alone and
[1:41:23] all the world go free over the years
[1:41:27] have changed through must Jesus bear the
[1:41:28] cross alone and all the world go free
[1:41:34] that's this one here but but the the the
[1:41:38] idea remains the same must Jesus bear
[1:41:41] the cross alone and all the world go
[1:41:42] free and brother read and use that song
[1:41:45] when he was talking about the the lady
[1:41:47] that had the drunk the drunkard that was
[1:41:49] a husband and maybe day and night should
[1:41:53] have to go through two or more when he
[1:41:54] would come home drunk and call her all
[1:41:57] sorts of names and and basically treated
[1:41:59] like nothing and don't know the
[1:42:03] situation there but you can imagine that
[1:42:04] wasn't nice it and the and for a
[1:42:07] Christian lady I think a nice godly
[1:42:10] woman you know should be at a different
[1:42:11] environment than there be here she is in
[1:42:12] their environment a godly woman just
[1:42:14] wanted to serve the Lord if she's in
[1:42:15] that environment of just persecution and
[1:42:18] and the turmoil she must have gone
[1:42:20] through day-in day-out being editor at
[1:42:21] home it's not like it was a drama at
[1:42:23] work if she could come home and yet
[1:42:25] from it it was it was home it was all
[1:42:27] the time you know and then and so
[1:42:29] brother Brown tells the story of the the
[1:42:33] husband he came home with some of his
[1:42:35] friends and they're saying I don't
[1:42:36] believe God's really neat no he's not
[1:42:37] and the husband said no actually I think
[1:42:39] he is because I think some because my
[1:42:42] wife's a real Christian I think God's
[1:42:44] real and he said I watch this I'll show
[1:42:47] you so you see they went in there and he
[1:42:50] said with his friends and their husbands
[1:42:54] he saw his wife you know cook me this
[1:42:55] cooked me that do this through that and
[1:42:57] she makes some food and then when she
[1:42:59] comes back with the food she tries it he
[1:43:01] says oh that's disgusting
[1:43:02] back and they all look like they drunk
[1:43:04] in there and she just she she didn't
[1:43:07] fight back from the carnal person right
[1:43:10] she fought back with a spiritual person
[1:43:13] that's a hard fight easy to say but and
[1:43:17] the time it was a hard fight to she she
[1:43:20] umbrella round and say it's here they
[1:43:24] went out and sit sit down like that you
[1:43:26] know and then and she came out and said
[1:43:29] dear I'm sorry I didn't get them folks
[1:43:30] I'll fix some more for you all nonsense
[1:43:33] you know that I didn't want them that
[1:43:34] way in the first place just carrying on
[1:43:35] like that about the food they went out
[1:43:38] there and sit down and act like they was
[1:43:39] drunk they heard here in their kind of
[1:43:42] snubbing to herself singing and a real
[1:43:45] low voice must Jesus be the cross alone
[1:43:48] in all the world go free there's a cross
[1:43:50] river road and there's a cross for me
[1:43:51] that's consecrated cross I'll beer
[1:43:53] toward this shot set me free wonder I
[1:43:56] looked these other what I said she's a
[1:43:57] Christian she's got it they were
[1:44:00] overcome overcome and that little woman
[1:44:04] led her husband plus there's others to
[1:44:06] Christ at night see why I just be real
[1:44:08] sweet just remember he knows all about
[1:44:09] it that's how a Christian fights that's
[1:44:13] how we really fight it's not on there

[1:44:29] everything that you obtain for me to do
[1:44:32] regardless of the price regardless of
[1:44:35] the cost regardless of the criticism how
[1:44:37] hard the crosses

[1:44:40] consecrated cross off the air until the
[1:44:42] earth shall set me free being go home a
[1:44:44] crown to wear there's a crown for me
[1:44:46] must Jesus bear the cross alone in all
[1:44:48] the world go free no there's a cross for
[1:44:50] everyone and there's a cross for me I
[1:44:54] put this up here because on the what
[1:44:56] Sept this morning I don't know if you
[1:44:58] recall it but on the last I think it was
[1:45:04] the daily altar as these times may be
[1:45:08] heard God has not promised a flower
[1:45:09] beard of ease but he has promised grace
[1:45:11] sufficient for a patrol that can hit you
[1:45:13] that's right yes indeed grace is
[1:45:15] sufficient not he's on a flower bit of
[1:45:17] ease but he's promised grace to overcome
[1:45:18] and every temptation when a cross gets
[1:45:20] here be Christ promised to be with you
[1:45:22] yes sir he's the great comforter and he
[1:45:25] was referencing to the song but Isaac
[1:45:27] wants to see it am i a soldier of the
[1:45:28] cross a follower of the land and shall I
[1:45:31] fear to own his cause with blushes
[1:45:32] speaker's name and the name the precious
[1:45:35] name of whom who died for me through
[1:45:36] grace I'll win the promised ground
[1:45:38] whatever Mike Ross may be must I be
[1:45:40] carried to the skies on a flowery beard
[1:45:42] of ease well others fought to win the
[1:45:45] prize and sailed through bloody seas are
[1:45:49] there no foes for me to face must I not
[1:45:52] stem the flood as this as this vile
[1:45:57] world a friend to grace to help me on to
[1:45:59] God since I must fight the father would
[1:46:01] reign increase my courage Lord I'll bear
[1:46:04] the toil enjoy the pain supported by thy
[1:46:06] word that's us it's their attitude let
[1:46:12] me go through this for five minutes and
[1:46:13] then I want to say something after that
[1:46:14] then we're done this is from if you
[1:46:21] could turn to Joshua 1 verse 1 to 9 get
[1:46:23] it on there
[1:46:24] will I get this
[1:46:50] now after the death of Moses the servant
[1:46:52] of the Lord it came to pass it the Lord
[1:46:54] spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[1:46:56] minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[1:46:58] and now therefore arise go over this
[1:47:01] Jordan thou in all his people unto the
[1:47:02] land which I do give them even to the
[1:47:05] children of Israel every place that the
[1:47:09] sole of your foot shall tread upon there
[1:47:12] have I given you as I see it unto Moses
[1:47:14] from the wilderness and this Lebanon
[1:47:17] even unto the great river the river
[1:47:18] Euphrates all the land of the Hittites
[1:47:20] and of the great and unto the Great Sea
[1:47:22] toward going down at the Sun shall be
[1:47:24] your coast
[1:47:37] this is such an interesting scripture
[1:47:39] because God promised them a certain area
[1:47:42] he said your area will be from here to
[1:47:44] over here okay so the first thing you
[1:47:48] see this is this is what you're going to
[1:47:49] have the second thing you said was you
[1:47:52] can have what you have a part of that
[1:47:54] that the soles of your feet tread upon
[1:47:58] whichever part put them that part that
[1:48:02] the soles of your feet tread upon you
[1:48:04] can have that's astounding because that
[1:48:09] means that you can't just set this aside
[1:48:11] and have it all it's all there but you
[1:48:14] have to get it yourself
[1:48:15] and if you're willing to take a step so
[1:48:19] what this you'll get that anyplace where
[1:48:24] you tread this well then the promise
[1:48:25] I've given you you'll get if you treat
[1:48:28] here you'll get that if you see the
[1:48:32] promise says you are in there but there
[1:48:33] and you're willing to walk there you'll
[1:48:35] get there and I'll have that yes but if
[1:48:38] you see it there and stand here you will
[1:48:40] not get there that's right that's the
[1:48:43] way this whole thing works unless you're
[1:48:45] willing to fight for it you won't get it
[1:48:47] now remember what we talked about the
[1:48:49] beginning about a fight the reason why
[1:48:50] is there's people there that don't want
[1:48:52] you to have it the enemy is not going to
[1:48:54] give up so you take it they fortify
[1:48:57] themselves and say we're gonna fight
[1:48:58] against you every step of the way if you
[1:49:00] want to take this but if there's a
[1:49:02] promise saying it's yours if we are
[1:49:04] willing to walk and place our foot on
[1:49:07] that promise we'll get it yes that's the
[1:49:09] way this works and that's why we have to
[1:49:11] be soldiers and fight because without a
[1:49:12] fight we won't get anything in this
[1:49:14] Christian walk we need to fight there is
[1:49:17] no way that we can achieve this fighting
[1:49:19] when they got to the land I've got the
[1:49:21] picture on the this side here is
[1:49:23] actually the occupants that were already
[1:49:25] there and I like this label because it's
[1:49:26] his Nations to be displaced from the
[1:49:29] promised land
[1:49:29] there were people already there that
[1:49:32] were actually disand to be displaced
[1:49:33] should any of the children the bursar
[1:49:35] I've decided to have the part of land
[1:49:37] that they were on it was all divided up
[1:49:39] but there were people there already
[1:49:40] every promise we've got Satan's there to
[1:49:43] fight against it but as sure as anything
[1:49:46] if we're willing to fight and
[1:49:48] - stand step forward that's why I was
[1:49:51] touched by sister Hannah's book I've got
[1:49:53] this at the end that she wrote Priya's
[1:49:55] everyday because it it spoke to me like
[1:49:58] there's somebody that wakes up if your
[1:49:59] dance is no Amy I'm gonna fight back I'm
[1:50:02] fighting back I want this I want that
[1:50:05] I'm not just gonna sit back oh wow this
[1:50:06] is the way life is I'm gonna fight back
[1:50:08] a man before I decide this I'll have it
[1:50:10] if I decide that I'm gonna have it a man
[1:50:11] she fought back and this that that I
[1:50:14] think that's what encouraged me the most
[1:50:15] because I saw a fighting spirit there
[1:50:17] she may be tired one day and it's got a
[1:50:19] big day work but she wakes up and fights
[1:50:21] back to me that's courage that's what a
[1:50:23] real Christian does that's that we
[1:50:24] should act as Christians Amy let me read
[1:50:27] this here how long does a baby cry until
[1:50:29] it gets satisfied and that's the way the
[1:50:30] believing Christians should do God's
[1:50:32] child if you see that God made a promise
[1:50:34] don't give up cry to what science
[1:50:36] encroach you to see God's word God
[1:50:38] vindicate his word when go up indicates
[1:50:40] as word improves it's here then you
[1:50:41] didn't have to cry no more you got it
[1:50:43] walk away and thank him for it until you
[1:50:45] do that scream out to new get it
[1:50:46] I like their persistent holding on not a
[1:50:48] hybrid plant but one there has to be
[1:50:50] babied impeding impact around Christians
[1:50:53] are real genuine born articles of God
[1:50:55] they fight for their position and fight
[1:50:57] til they finish on this earth every move
[1:50:59] of it as a fight God told Moses he gave
[1:51:02] him the land he told Joshua every place
[1:51:04] the foot or sole of your foot treads on
[1:51:05] that have I given you they had to fight
[1:51:07] for every inch of it so do we have to
[1:51:09] fight for every inch of it it isn't
[1:51:11] something to be baby competed and around
[1:51:14] like that and say well I'll take you
[1:51:15] over there and see what you think about
[1:51:16] it you pass your opinion there's no way
[1:51:18] - come come with the determination come
[1:51:20] here going to stay there till has
[1:51:22] overstayed each of God answers and
[1:51:24] vindicates that's our attitude as a
[1:51:26] believer
[1:51:26] we're going to fight back a man that
[1:51:29] believes in God can see the presence of
[1:51:30] God feel the presence of God sense of
[1:51:32] presence and God know he's here he's
[1:51:34] here to us and everything that he made
[1:51:35] promises for you on the stage being
[1:51:37] cried soon you get it hold on to him
[1:51:39] don't leave if you have to stay day and
[1:51:41] night don't give up a fighter doesn't
[1:51:43] give up keep fighting you'll get it
[1:51:45] you're won every single battle of a
[1:51:47] sinners word you're won every single
[1:51:48] battle that comes your way your look
[1:51:51] you'll attain to every single promise if
[1:51:52] you want it that's our promise that's
[1:51:54] the that's what's been divided to us God
[1:51:57] told Moses down in Egypt land he said I
[1:52:00] have given you Palestine there's a good
[1:52:01] lesson
[1:52:02] there for a minute God's Word said to
[1:52:03] Moses Palestine belongs to the children
[1:52:05] of Israel now God could have went up
[1:52:07] there and Sheree TV one of them
[1:52:08] Philistines and so forth out and then
[1:52:12] see come on Moses just come up and sit
[1:52:14] down and take it easy
[1:52:15] but Moses Joshua and the Israelites had
[1:52:17] to fight for every inch of ground they
[1:52:19] got and if we promise in the book is
[1:52:20] yours but God will never give it to you
[1:52:23] and you lay back on the beard of ease
[1:52:25] right you'll fight for every inch of
[1:52:27] ground you get he told Joshua every
[1:52:29] place the sole of your foot treads that
[1:52:31] have I given you footprints meant
[1:52:33] victory and it's the same thing tonight
[1:52:35] if you're paralyzed and you can't wiggle
[1:52:38] a finger say God I want to wiggle my
[1:52:40] finger that's right you promised me I
[1:52:42] could do it and I'll lay there and
[1:52:43] wiggle to like wiggle till I do wiggle
[1:52:46] oh that's right god maybe the promise
[1:52:48] God told me I could put my foot on the
[1:52:50] floor and here it comes here it comes
[1:52:51] here sport it's coming just keep on
[1:52:53] something you do put your foot on the
[1:52:55] floor that's it fight for every energy
[1:52:57] things that's handed to you that's
[1:52:59] what's the matter with the American
[1:53:00] people in US as well tonight we've
[1:53:02] gotten everything you've gotten
[1:53:04] everything handed to you well feed fat
[1:53:05] and then clothes and everything else
[1:53:07] you've got no need for nothing but you
[1:53:09] don't but don't realize you're miserable
[1:53:11] Richard and blind now I'm not saying
[1:53:13] that's us but I'm just saying that's the
[1:53:14] attitude right we get everything handed
[1:53:16] to us it doesn't come to us Satan not
[1:53:19] going to give nothing we've got to fight
[1:53:21] for it but we've been given promises
[1:53:22] then it's ours amen amen I like the
[1:53:25] story here this is a story of David and
[1:53:28] if you know the story of David he was
[1:53:30] God and made him King and David had to
[1:53:32] fight his way to the kingdom you know he
[1:53:34] was anointed king when he was what was
[1:53:36] it thirteen fourteen he may be younger
[1:53:38] maybe you thought it's all just gonna
[1:53:40] come easy to me and I'm just gonna end
[1:53:41] up on the throne even when he when he
[1:53:43] went into the house of Saul and he
[1:53:45] started playing for Saul the heart baby
[1:53:46] he thought well this is that maybe
[1:53:47] within a year or two I'll be on the
[1:53:48] throne I think he waited another fifteen
[1:53:51] years and and when it looked like it was
[1:53:53] getting closer when all the people were
[1:53:55] were saying Saul slowest thousands and
[1:53:57] David tens of thousands right after that
[1:54:00] Saul's on David's on the run and then
[1:54:02] before you know it he finds himself out
[1:54:03] in the wilderness there with a bunch of
[1:54:05] ragtag men that were renegades and guys
[1:54:07] and debt and everyone that no one else
[1:54:09] wanted David ended up with all these men
[1:54:10] that no one wanted and that's him as a
[1:54:13] king
[1:54:14] yeah but but David knew God's gonna make
[1:54:16] me king I'm gonna be the king and he
[1:54:19] didn't actually have to fight for it in
[1:54:20] his own way but he trusted in God and he
[1:54:22] and he he fought and fought and fought
[1:54:24] was essentially fought his way to the
[1:54:25] kingdom but he did one day become king
[1:54:29] but then you know the story of David he
[1:54:31] saw Bathsheba there and he he committed
[1:54:35] the sin with fish Seabury had her
[1:54:36] husband killed which was actually listed
[1:54:40] as one of the mighty men he had and he
[1:54:41] had him killed so that he could have
[1:54:42] because he'd found out that his wife was
[1:54:45] pregnant so he he brought her back one
[1:54:47] night and because he wanted to have her
[1:54:49] have him go into his wife and so they
[1:54:51] would be back near the night and he
[1:54:53] would go back to the the battlefield and
[1:54:55] then she would say oh it's um it's his
[1:54:57] son but when he came back he that this I
[1:55:00] forget his name but he said I'm not
[1:55:02] gonna go him with my wife and all my
[1:55:04] soldiers and all my fellow brethren are
[1:55:05] out there on the field fighting I'm
[1:55:06] going to sleep out on the front court
[1:55:08] here tonight I'm not going in there and
[1:55:10] Dave was upset and he tried to do it
[1:55:11] again to get him get him drunk and make
[1:55:13] him go back to his house and he wouldn't
[1:55:14] do it he went back so then David had to
[1:55:16] come up with another plan to kill him
[1:55:18] such evil and and as a result God said
[1:55:22] because of that the sword will not
[1:55:23] depart out of your house will never
[1:55:25] depart from your house and it wasn't
[1:55:27] long till one of a one of David's sons
[1:55:30] like one of his daughters from another
[1:55:32] another mother he had a few of them
[1:55:34] tamer and he ended up he raped tamer and
[1:55:38] one of the other brothers that was a
[1:55:39] sister to tamer he was a real sister
[1:55:43] Absalom
[1:55:44] he was upset by this inherited in his
[1:55:46] heart all the time to kill this other
[1:55:48] brother and so he eventually did when
[1:55:50] they went with the shearers and they
[1:55:52] didn't get along David and Absalom and
[1:55:56] after quite a few years
[1:55:58] Absalom came back to Jerusalem through
[1:56:00] the help of Joab he came back and they
[1:56:02] kind of got along with kind of didn't
[1:56:03] and then the people all started liking
[1:56:05] Absalom a bit more than David after that
[1:56:08] because Absalom was sitting the gate and
[1:56:10] he would ask the people what they want
[1:56:11] and it was very good looking man I think
[1:56:13] he had really long here has sent us here
[1:56:15] weighed a lot he would had this big book
[1:56:17] here and I think he was quite tall and
[1:56:19] good-looking and and eventually it got
[1:56:24] to the point where Absalom said to David
[1:56:27] I'm gonna I want to go and do sacrifice
[1:56:29] to the Lord in a certain place but his
[1:56:32] plan was that he tricked his father when
[1:56:34] he when he went to go and do that he
[1:56:38] blew a trumpet and he said to all his
[1:56:39] men you know when I blow that when the
[1:56:40] trumpet blows declare me the king so
[1:56:42] well he was gone they blew the trumpet
[1:56:44] and declared Absalom king now David this
[1:56:48] mighty meant word got back to him
[1:56:51] Absalom has declared himself king and
[1:56:54] David said to his men
[1:56:56] we run let's run brothers if he comes
[1:57:01] back here he's going to annihilate us
[1:57:02] this run and so David ran together
[1:57:06] God has few mighty men and some of the
[1:57:08] woman left half the woman there and he
[1:57:10] ran he ran away from his son Absalom
[1:57:13] because he said if the kids back to
[1:57:14] Jerusalem we'll all be dead so he ran
[1:57:17] and that's when he crossed over the
[1:57:18] brook and that's when there I forget the
[1:57:21] other man's name but the son of Belial
[1:57:24] they call him he was throwing stones at
[1:57:26] him and said ask because you know you
[1:57:27] what you did to the house of Saul and he
[1:57:29] was throwing rocks at him but David knew
[1:57:31] that it was because of what he'd done
[1:57:32] with Bathsheba he said God told him to
[1:57:34] do this leave him alone and and David
[1:57:40] ran out as a rejected King and then
[1:57:43] Absalom Absalom became the King and he
[1:57:47] took his father's concubines and that
[1:57:48] and then they said there was a man there
[1:57:50] how I'll just paraphrase us rather than
[1:57:52] reading the scriptures it was a man
[1:57:54] there that gave counsel to both David
[1:57:55] and he was now going to give counsel to
[1:57:57] Epsilon and they said what should we do
[1:57:59] with David now because David's run away
[1:58:01] what should we do and this man says this
[1:58:04] is what you should do nowadays of the
[1:58:06] counsel of this man that his counsel was
[1:58:08] as the Oracles of God he was so wise the
[1:58:13] it was as though God was speaking to you
[1:58:15] and giving you counsel say see this is
[1:58:17] what you should do
[1:58:18] David at the moment as weak he's on the
[1:58:21] run tonight
[1:58:23] you give me certain amount of men to put
[1:58:27] 12 thousand men him and his men are on
[1:58:29] the run they're weak they're weary
[1:58:31] they're tired give me min tonight I'll
[1:58:34] go there and I'll so I'll only get home
[1:58:36] because when they see me coming all the
[1:58:38] people around him will run and I'll just
[1:58:40] get
[1:58:41] all our doors kill David then I'll come
[1:58:43] back he said in the whole of the kingdom
[1:58:45] will come to you and they all said
[1:58:48] that's very good advice we'll take that
[1:58:50] advice then Absalom said ok I'll just
[1:58:53] ask one more piece of counsel one more
[1:58:56] piece of counsel and there was another
[1:58:59] man that was going to go with David but
[1:59:00] David said to him now you go back to
[1:59:02] Absalom and if it comes up that you can
[1:59:05] give counsel you counsel them something
[1:59:07] different so it doesn't hit me but I'm
[1:59:13] going to take it right I'm going to take
[1:59:14] it from the standpoint the counsel of
[1:59:17] that man was just looking at natural
[1:59:19] things right the counsel of that man was
[1:59:22] looking at natural things naturally
[1:59:24] speaking David was weary and tired and
[1:59:27] on the run that was the truth naturally
[1:59:30] speaking right that's natural but I'm
[1:59:34] going to say that this next man's
[1:59:35] counsel was the spoke by faith so they
[1:59:39] said to this other men so and so said
[1:59:41] this counsel but what do you think we
[1:59:43] should do he said Brisbane that man's
[1:59:51] counsel is not good you underestimate
[1:59:55] David you underestimate David David is a
[2:00:02] man of war David's a man of war he's
[2:00:09] like a man that's been like a beer
[2:00:11] that's been robbed of its Cubs he's
[2:00:13] gonna be angry you're gonna go and try
[2:00:16] and find him down there amongst all the
[2:00:18] woman and children he won't be there
[2:00:19] he'll be hiding up in the hills
[2:00:21] somewhere waiting for you and all the
[2:00:24] men that are with him are mighty men you
[2:00:27] go down there and try and get him he'll
[2:00:30] be hiding in the hills
[2:00:31] he'll come down and kill some of you
[2:00:33] guys and then all of Israel know that
[2:00:35] he's a mighty man and they'll all get
[2:00:37] scared and he says even those were the
[2:00:38] heart of a lion will faint and they'll
[2:00:40] say no we don't want to fight against
[2:00:42] David he's such a mighty man of Valor we
[2:00:45] don't want to serve Absalom we want to
[2:00:46] serve David see then you will lose the
[2:00:48] kingdom faith spoke that yes
[2:00:52] even though David was there of his own
[2:00:54] mistakes and of his own failures and
[2:00:56] actually what they spoke about him was
[2:00:57] truth faith spoke of David you're a
[2:00:59] mighty man of Valor he's a mighty man of
[2:01:02] Fela he's a man of war and there's men
[2:01:06] that are with him hey a mighty men
[2:01:09] they're mighty men amen you won't be
[2:01:12] able to beat them and they said whoa
[2:01:16] you're right amen and they didn't go and
[2:01:20] fight him and that's what faith speaks
[2:01:23] about you and me sometimes we get down
[2:01:26] and things get us down and the truth
[2:01:28] beyond where we can on the run and you
[2:01:31] know like we've failed but faith never
[2:01:33] ever speak said of us faith always
[2:01:35] speaks of you that you're you are a
[2:01:38] mighty men and woman of Valor faith
[2:01:40] always speaks that of you it never says
[2:01:43] you're weak it never says that it never
[2:01:45] says you can't do it it always says
[2:01:47] you're a mighty man of Valor because
[2:01:48] that light Venu is mighty undefeatable
[2:01:51] in your reputation amongst the kingdom
[2:01:53] of Satan is he's a mighty man of Valor
[2:01:54] that's who we are
[2:01:56] we're not weaklings we're mighty men of
[2:01:59] valor I like that story
[2:02:10] I've got seven more minutes to say
[2:02:13] something is that alright I'm just gonna
[2:02:21] give me seven minutes I want and then
[2:02:23] I'm closing I just want oh I want to
[2:02:25] tell you this because I don't like it
[2:02:27] being on the video but I want to tell
[2:02:28] you because you're my you're my friends
[2:02:30] right and we you know we think with the
[2:02:31] only ones that go through things we're
[2:02:33] not and thou shalt remember all the way
[2:02:38] which the LORD thy God led me these
[2:02:40] forty years in the wilderness to Humble
[2:02:42] the in to prove me and to know what was
[2:02:43] a nine heart whether they were keep his
[2:02:45] Commandments or no not only do we get
[2:02:48] fought but we get tried and tested by
[2:02:51] God and I read this quote someone sent
[2:02:55] this quote on the what's it daily ultra
[2:02:59] a few months ago and I've things made
[2:03:03] sense after I read this one because I
[2:03:05] didn't know this was here in America as
[2:03:08] American Christians God is going to
[2:03:09] require a lot at our hands because we
[2:03:11] have the true gospel light and we're
[2:03:12] failing to make use of it like we should
[2:03:14] do so tonight I want to speak to the
[2:03:16] Christian concerning how you could
[2:03:17] grieve away at the time of repentance
[2:03:19] for you and that and how that you could
[2:03:22] be absolutely marked out having no part
[2:03:25] with Christ by making the wrong choice
[2:03:27] now these things are a little rough but
[2:03:29] it has to get rough once in a while to
[2:03:31] to make us appreciate the Lord Jesus but
[2:03:33] I was getting onto this piece brother
[2:03:35] meet me today as I was going out and he
[2:03:38] said brother Brennan financial troubles
[2:03:40] has burdened his heart he said after
[2:03:42] hearing about poor people in India and
[2:03:44] so forth he said but every time it said
[2:03:46] I've got good health but everything is
[2:03:48] just banging me down and I said every
[2:03:51] Son of God every son that cometh to God
[2:03:53] must be chastened of God every time we
[2:03:56] just have to be tried God's what laid on
[2:03:58] us seemed like being innocent God is
[2:04:01] doing that to prove that we are sons
[2:04:02] those who cannot stand chastisement as
[2:04:05] illegitimate children we're not true
[2:04:07] sons of God but that man a woman who can
[2:04:09] stand and take their whooping and
[2:04:10] everything going wrong and still look up
[2:04:12] and say Lord I love you that's the one
[2:04:16] he that endureth to the end the same
[2:04:18] shall be saved now I love that don't you
[2:04:20] and I knowing this that tribulation
[2:04:23] worketh patience patience worketh hope
[2:04:25] hope maketh not ashamed near you I see
[2:04:27] tribulations work patience be patient
[2:04:29] and hope maketh not ashamed and we've
[2:04:32] got the hope tonight and all our
[2:04:34] tribulation yet it works tribulations
[2:04:36] makes us patient waiting to the coming
[2:04:39] of the Lord I'm going to time myself
[2:04:43] because my time is up
[2:04:45] but I want to I want to just want to
[2:04:48] just tell you this I want to tell you
[2:04:50] one of the flights that I've had to go
[2:04:51] through too because we all go through
[2:04:55] different flights right but we're all
[2:04:56] breeds randomness together and sometimes
[2:05:00] fights some of the thing or the testings
[2:05:02] of God in the hardship you have to go
[2:05:03] through you sometimes think man this is
[2:05:05] almost not becoming as a Christian but
[2:05:07] if it's not hard then it doesn't work
[2:05:11] and as believers you're going to go
[2:05:14] through maybe some of you are now maybe
[2:05:16] it's lining up for you you're going to
[2:05:18] go through some very very hard things in
[2:05:19] your life very hard things and the some
[2:05:22] of us not going to make any sense to you
[2:05:23] at all
[2:05:24] sometimes it doesn't make sense and
[2:05:26] we're not talking you know I my car
[2:05:28] broke down on the way summer and I here
[2:05:30] I was an hour late to go and buy this
[2:05:31] thing I wanted to buy we're talking
[2:05:33] years and years and years of something
[2:05:35] that you don't have answers for and it's
[2:05:37] years and years and years and years but
[2:05:41] it tries you a test you it makes you
[2:05:43] tough it makes you hard tests what's in
[2:05:46] your heart God doesn't just send us out
[2:05:48] you know unprepared he tries us and
[2:05:51] tests us makes us hard he doesn't want
[2:05:55] us to be weak he doesn't want us to just
[2:05:56] when hardship comes we just roll over we
[2:06:01] just would give up he doesn't want that
[2:06:03] from us so he's got to train us his
[2:06:07] divine hand of love trains us
[2:06:12] I had a I had a about 15 years ago I had
[2:06:20] these these businesses and Gisborne and
[2:06:24] I and I got these scriptures to do them
[2:06:27] it started when I started them all they
[2:06:29] all wheat so well and I just couldn't
[2:06:30] believe how well everything was going
[2:06:32] for about a couple of years it was just
[2:06:33] like you'd never must have beat you know
[2:06:35] this Annette and before you know what I
[2:06:37] had a few houses and this and that man
[2:06:39] it was that was the good times right
[2:06:41] something said to me and August
[2:06:44] something's going to change August 2007
[2:06:46] something's gonna change me being me and
[2:06:49] not understanding about fully about
[2:06:50] hardship I thought well it's only gonna
[2:06:52] get better from here
[2:06:53] I can't wait to see what it is no man
[2:06:57] all was 2007 came and things started
[2:06:59] changing a right they started changing
[2:07:00] for the worse and they started things
[2:07:04] started going downhill they just went
[2:07:07] bad that didn't matter what I did what
[2:07:10] if I made things just started going bad
[2:07:13] bad bad bad bad for years until in 2009
[2:07:18] I've lost everything
[2:07:20] was all gone okay but you know in my
[2:07:24] younger walk I had enough natural
[2:07:26] resilience to just be well praise at all
[2:07:29] you know a lot of it was my natural man
[2:07:31] that I'm naturally quite a resilient
[2:07:32] person and the flesh right so a lot of
[2:07:35] that was still the I was just like I
[2:07:36] praise the Lord you know like I had
[2:07:38] these houses my last hope was some you
[2:07:39] know my last hope was I thought what
[2:07:41] I've got this house I'll fix that thing
[2:07:43] up and I'll sell it and I'll get some
[2:07:45] money and I'll be able to sort things
[2:07:46] out with that then the thing burnt down
[2:07:47] some I burnt it down and it the
[2:07:49] insurance was wrong I didn't get cover
[2:07:50] for that so that was all gone to things
[2:07:52] like my last but I hope was all gone and
[2:07:54] even when that happened I said Lord
[2:07:56] praise the Lord you know now I meant it
[2:07:57] I meant it and it was hard but still it
[2:08:01] wasn't really it was still my natural
[2:08:03] man that was a bit resilient but
[2:08:06] something said to me back then and 2009
[2:08:09] I'm gonna restore back everything that
[2:08:11] that was gone plus more you'll get it
[2:08:13] all back and then he also said to that
[2:08:15] if you know the calling and my life is
[2:08:17] to make a make a movie on the life of
[2:08:19] brother bury me see you'll get all the
[2:08:20] money you need for that cuz it's quite a
[2:08:22] lot of money right you'll get all you
[2:08:25] need for that
[2:08:26] so I moved to Wellington with nothing
[2:08:28] because it's all gone
[2:08:29] well the promise is what I'm gonna give
[2:08:32] to you this is the way it's gonna be so
[2:08:34] so we get here
[2:08:36] and we'll then about through I will call
[2:08:39] it a miraculous series of events because
[2:08:41] you know when you lose everything when
[2:08:42] you've got to liquidate things your
[2:08:43] critters not that good and you've had to
[2:08:44] just battle things I was battling for
[2:08:45] years and stuff was just a constant
[2:08:48] barrage of stuff your credits shot right
[2:08:52] so you've got to start from the bottom
[2:08:53] again well then I think it was six
[2:08:55] months of maybe eight months of being
[2:08:57] here Andy and I had we had this business
[2:09:01] with maybe 15 guys and we bought all
[2:09:03] that was worth them I think we paid it
[2:09:05] for you whatever it was two hundred
[2:09:06] thousand for something neither of us had
[2:09:08] any money right but the Lord just
[2:09:10] arranged it that way it was a almost a
[2:09:13] suit there was a supernatural thing the
[2:09:15] way it occurred the guy wanted me to go
[2:09:17] into partnership with him I got clear
[2:09:18] scriptures saying don't go into
[2:09:19] partnership because I because the guy I
[2:09:21] said to the guy I want the business we
[2:09:23] were going to buy business and I didn't
[2:09:25] have any money he knew that so he said
[2:09:26] I'll go a partnership with you and I'll
[2:09:27] just be a silent investor and you just
[2:09:29] work hard and make the money and you
[2:09:30] just give me money on the side you know
[2:09:31] he thought he had it all sewn up and I
[2:09:33] thought there was the way but the Lord
[2:09:34] gave scriptures saying don't go into
[2:09:35] partnership with this guy and and they
[2:09:39] were really clear scripture so I had to
[2:09:40] go and tell him I said I can't go into
[2:09:42] partnership with you I just can't do it
[2:09:44] and he said what are you gonna do and I
[2:09:46] said but I want the whole business
[2:09:48] though I just don't we go in partnership
[2:09:49] with you and he said we can make that
[2:09:52] work
[2:09:53] right so so we made that work okay
[2:09:57] now you think praise the Lord here the
[2:09:59] promises are going to come to pass you
[2:10:01] know it got some new business
[2:10:01] everything's gonna go well
[2:10:03] my my my well then about eight months
[2:10:09] things just worked so bad I'm just going
[2:10:11] oh this is this is impossible and then
[2:10:14] after a year I'm comin
[2:10:17] it was it was almost unbelievable I'm
[2:10:20] sort of half worse of trouble I'm going
[2:10:21] this is just a night me this is a night
[2:10:24] me and they're the if you know the story
[2:10:28] we we we wanted to
[2:10:33] see we just couldn't pay all this money
[2:10:35] right I'm gonna go man I thought I
[2:10:38] thought this was over I thought I
[2:10:39] thought I've had my five years of us I
[2:10:41] thought I'm done but I had to go another
[2:10:43] round and we were going to be forcibly
[2:10:47] liquidated right for a $300,000 roughly
[2:10:51] there abouts this is the funny part of
[2:10:55] the story but I'd actually the Lord laid
[2:10:58] on my heart early in that when we've got
[2:11:00] the business to pay tithe for the
[2:11:01] fellowship a certain amount every month
[2:11:02] right to pay it to pair two pair and so
[2:11:05] about a year later we were like I mean
[2:11:08] this whole business is gonna be gone a
[2:11:10] year and a half later it's all gonna be
[2:11:12] gone and yeah I thought but something um
[2:11:14] he said now I've actually given to the
[2:11:15] Lord sometimes it was tough we had
[2:11:17] nothing but we gave right I've given
[2:11:19] given given but that was enough for me
[2:11:21] to say no no no no this I can't see this
[2:11:24] happen
[2:11:25] I can't see this the liquidators run
[2:11:27] they're saying you need to close this
[2:11:28] whole thing down it's all over you're
[2:11:29] done man you're going to be bankrupted
[2:11:30] us all over something in me said no
[2:11:32] we've given enough to the Lord doesn't
[2:11:34] do that I just couldn't accept that that
[2:11:36] this this business could could obey the
[2:11:38] court that the word of the Lord and do
[2:11:41] that and then a year and a half later he
[2:11:42] just closes you down it's something
[2:11:45] better it doesn't sit right with me so
[2:11:46] we told that look what I just know I
[2:11:47] thought of no I believe God's gonna
[2:11:48] deliver me he thought we were crazy
[2:11:51] right God's gonna do love me at us we're
[2:11:53] gonna keep going he said no you're not
[2:11:55] gonna keep going it's all over for you
[2:11:56] there's no chance right but he long
[2:12:00] story short he said he won herself look
[2:12:03] glad I said no we're not gonna be
[2:12:04] liquidated we're not gonna be closed
[2:12:05] down and in the end I got a phone call
[2:12:10] from the guy that was wanting to close
[2:12:11] me down he said oh we've written the
[2:12:12] whole lot off your everything's gone
[2:12:14] you're free basically see you later have
[2:12:18] a good life right but it all disappeared
[2:12:20] overnight okay anything well praise the
[2:12:24] Lord now it's time to really fight back
[2:12:25] in you know now the Lord's going to just
[2:12:27] continue to deliver us right yeah he's
[2:12:30] gonna deliver a year later because you
[2:12:35] still got a bet on your way through this
[2:12:36] stuff a year later I'm at work in
[2:12:38] Auckland and one of the flooring
[2:12:42] businesses we had was down south was
[2:12:44] having a lot of issues episode all this
[2:12:46] the things that gone wrong it was owed
[2:12:47] all this money down there someone was
[2:12:50] doing something that client had gone all
[2:12:51] funny about this job and it was a
[2:12:53] political thing but we were caught in
[2:12:54] the meat grinder between a husband and
[2:12:56] wife dispute that the husband wanted the
[2:12:58] certain foreign the wife didn't want it
[2:12:59] so she was trying to get he be excused
[2:13:01] to get the falling out of the house and
[2:13:02] get the one she wanted we just happened
[2:13:04] to install the flooring so it was all it
[2:13:06] was ugly and we couldn't do anything
[2:13:08] about it right I'm an Auckland and I get
[2:13:11] if we we we read an article in the
[2:13:13] newspaper about this man that had
[2:13:14] crashed and died in the wire effor
[2:13:17] someone takes me she said I bet quite
[2:13:19] died and he was a director of a building
[2:13:21] company that we did a lot of work for
[2:13:23] and he had us all this money I'm
[2:13:25] probably not going to get bit now
[2:13:26] because well word got around that he was
[2:13:28] as company wasn't in a very good
[2:13:29] situation so so you know straight away
[2:13:33] we were probably not going to get their
[2:13:34] money done a week or two later I'm in
[2:13:38] Auckland I get a phone call from the guy
[2:13:40] we originally bought the business off
[2:13:41] that we did a lot of work for he was
[2:13:43] another so one was 30 grand the other
[2:13:45] one was 20 he said I hey Isaac hey man
[2:13:48] he said I just got to read you something
[2:13:51] and he starts reading me a pre-prepared
[2:13:53] statement basically saying you know we

[2:15:40] need a better year after that we needed
[2:15:42] a certain amount to clear up this one
[2:15:44] one bill that we've got and Andy and we
[2:15:49] talked about it and so brother came here
[2:15:50] and preached once we talked to him and
[2:15:52] there was the the direction was we
[2:15:56] thought you know what if we need this
[2:15:57] amount of money we're going to give ten
[2:15:58] thousand sorry ten percent of that
[2:16:02] amount that we need right because
[2:16:03] there's these work it was coming to the
[2:16:05] last things needed to sort out with you
[2:16:06] we're gonna go Timbers into that in
[2:16:07] faith and believe the Lord will you give
[2:16:09] respect what we need for that right so
[2:16:13] so we were having him this was right
[2:16:15] before the youth camp that brother cadre
[2:16:17] dukes was he remember the quadrate dukes
[2:16:18] you can't write so so now I need to tell
[2:16:22] us to do you understand right so we say
[2:16:26] so we're all at this meeting and we're
[2:16:29] talking about this is the night before
[2:16:30] the camp we're just finalizing work
[2:16:32] stuff before we go to the camp and we're
[2:16:34] saying no we should I want to we need
[2:16:37] we're gonna do 12 twelve granter you
[2:16:40] know and then that's going to be 10% of
[2:16:41] what we need to sort out so we're gonna
[2:16:42] we're going to give that to the Lord and
[2:16:44] faith and we're going to believe the
[2:16:45] Lord's going to undertake so we were
[2:16:47] having the meeting and it was up to 10
[2:16:49] o'clock and we said okay it's almost 10
[2:16:50] I just want to get this done before 10
[2:16:53] o'clock rolls around because I want to
[2:16:54] process it tonight so it's just out of
[2:16:56] the way
[2:16:56] it clears on the back and then we go to
[2:16:58] the camp and we just leave it in the
[2:16:59] Lord's hands so we quickly do that let
[2:17:02] me carry on and do our thing now a year
[2:17:05] goes by right and you get no answer your
[2:17:09] thinking your mind employed you know
[2:17:11] I gave they're back they're like and I'm
[2:17:14] expecting these promises of it but I
[2:17:16] still haven't really this thing is not
[2:17:17] sorted it's been a year yeah it's just
[2:17:19] you don't think about it but it plays on
[2:17:21] your mind and then a year later we had
[2:17:24] another drama on her
[2:17:25] we were now smaller now right we had
[2:17:28] another drummer on a job we're the sky
[2:17:31] one of our guys can't speak very good
[2:17:33] English not you Benny another guy and he
[2:17:37] he grinds a poisonous product on a job
[2:17:40] because he didn't quite know what they
[2:17:42] meant we do it all that we'd probably do
[2:17:44] it all the time most people when you
[2:17:45] just deal with it but this one just blew
[2:17:47] up the client blew up and everything
[2:17:49] went bad as she said I'm gonna have to
[2:17:50] move out of the house so you could have
[2:17:51] to get the house blown out with this
[2:17:52] machine and workplace safety were
[2:17:54] involved it was it was a there was a
[2:17:56] drama and it cost $12,000 right so was
[2:18:01] it with the client we did it for SEMA
[2:18:02] we're not going to pay you the 12 grand
[2:18:03] so and we lost half of our work as a
[2:18:06] result so I'm thinking you're thinking
[2:18:07] okay now we just so now we wanted that
[2:18:10] much we gave that and then a year later
[2:18:11] we just lose that you know now this is
[2:18:15] this is on top of you fighting every day
[2:18:17] just to you know you're fighting because
[2:18:18] you believe the promise but you're
[2:18:19] fighting it and then so you start the
[2:18:22] next year after Christmas you start the
[2:18:24] next year with no work so you're sitting
[2:18:25] at home and you're going half my works
[2:18:28] gone right half of us gone now got
[2:18:33] listener and Satan's playing at your
[2:18:35] mind that's messing with you you know
[2:18:37] because this has been now 10 years
[2:18:39] you're going man I'm sure this is you
[2:18:44] know and then Satan starts saying in my
[2:18:48] mind you know what it is because God
[2:18:50] doesn't really love you you know maybe
[2:18:52] he used to be doesn't really love you
[2:18:54] much anymore
[2:18:56] this sounds when you're in your younger
[2:18:58] days that's nonsense
[2:18:59] but you know when you've been doing this
[2:19:01] for 10 years and sometimes you're
[2:19:02] getting beaten down you're at home and
[2:19:04] you just kind of halves the hatchet
[2:19:06] listen wasn't that better than that
[2:19:08] awful you know you wouldn't believe it I
[2:19:11] went through months and months I'll be
[2:19:12] driving in the car on the motorway and
[2:19:14] this would come on me I'll be so damn it
[2:19:16] because that hole that it would just
[2:19:18] bring me down so much it's actually
[2:19:19] because God doesn't really love you now
[2:19:21] it's not like he's not a God of love
[2:19:22] he's a God of love and I say he loves
[2:19:24] you
[2:19:25] she loves you just doesn't love you he
[2:19:29] loves you very nice or not and I
[2:19:30] actually struggled to think you I
[2:19:31] started thinking and maybe he doesn't
[2:19:33] don't love you man it was I remember
[2:19:37] being at home once you know know we've
[2:19:39] got dog kennels out by the front yard I
[2:19:41] don't know if you've been to our place
[2:19:42] the Bible says without our dogs
[2:19:45] you know dogs sort of go outside and
[2:19:47] this thing is on me for a long time and
[2:19:48] I'm digging down and I you know and I'm
[2:19:50] thinking yes yes you just you're open up
[2:19:53] your eye you know because your eyes
[2:19:54] pretty black cause you'll be beaten up
[2:19:55] by all the stuff and then I thought
[2:19:59] looked at my dog kennels the boys dog
[2:20:01] kennels and the dogs here and I thought
[2:20:02] well you know what I envisage the
[2:20:06] kingdom of God was sort of inside
[2:20:07] somewhere and I was out put the duck by
[2:20:09] the dogs and I thought well you know
[2:20:12] what I'm not going anywhere so I guess
[2:20:15] if that's the case of this and your
[2:20:17] agreement that we've got this sounds
[2:20:18] silly right but if that's in your
[2:20:20] agreement I'll just wait here I'm not
[2:20:23] going anywhere else what I ain't going
[2:20:25] anywhere
[2:20:26] I'm not going anywhere else I'll just
[2:20:28] wait here if you change your mind I'll
[2:20:29] be here out with the dogs you know yeah
[2:20:32] it doesn't sound like very victorious
[2:20:34] right but you know even when you're
[2:20:38] beaten right right right down just like
[2:20:39] well when you've done all to stand there
[2:20:42] I'm just gonna stand here then maybe I
[2:20:43] ain't got much strength this sort of
[2:20:45] white back understand here you know Hey
[2:20:49] yeah well leave us if you kill me on a
[2:20:51] get dragged away but otherwise I just
[2:20:53] stand you know you know and then you go
[2:20:59] on you go on you just you know but you
[2:21:03] got to be tried and tested what's in you
[2:21:04] when it really really really really
[2:21:06] really gets really really way down there
[2:21:08] what's on you man when it was really all
[2:21:10] the imagine something there that just
[2:21:12] didn't know I'm just gonna stand then
[2:21:14] when I have much fight leave sometimes
[2:21:16] I'm just gonna stand you know and I
[2:21:20] think I can share this but because this
[2:21:24] this bless me it was about a year after
[2:21:26] that that that we know when I was going
[2:21:31] through that maybe a few months after
[2:21:32] that the Brahman she had a testimony
[2:21:36] with me
[2:21:36] sorry Christine if I say this will been
[2:21:38] but I want to say it because these
[2:21:41] things are fict I want to show you the
[2:21:43] effect that ahead you know
[2:21:46] when before we did the cadre digs camp
[2:21:48] that the church had agreed to pay half
[2:21:51] with brother Hal ray right and and our
[2:21:56] portion was certain amount of think 18
[2:21:58] grand whatever it was to cover the fears
[2:22:00] and cover the different things right and
[2:22:02] and we as a fellowship were quite small
[2:22:03] back then we didn't actually have that
[2:22:04] the church didn't have that sort of
[2:22:06] money it's something had happened we
[2:22:07] didn't actually have it and Paul
[2:22:08] Christine was going out trying to do
[2:22:10] work at the hospital and you know to get
[2:22:11] $100 here $100 here to try and put in to
[2:22:14] cover it but it was a drop in the bucket
[2:22:15] you know that the money wasn't there and
[2:22:17] the day before the camp on the Thursday
[2:22:19] night brother Ben was at his house and
[2:22:21] sister Christina said look we're just
[2:22:23] gonna pray and believe God's gonna
[2:22:25] undertake we're just gonna pray God God
[2:22:27] God is gonna do this right he's gonna
[2:22:29] undertake for us we're just gonna pray
[2:22:31] so he's here on a Thursday night and
[2:22:33] they start praying and God we believe
[2:22:36] you're gonna do it cuz they have to go
[2:22:37] to the captain the next day right
[2:22:39] brother Ben maybe i paraphrased he might
[2:22:42] have said look I'm gonna check the
[2:22:43] account after I finish praying because
[2:22:45] it was about 10 o'clock I'm gonna cheat
[2:22:47] you count when I finish praying and see
[2:22:48] if there's any money there and a lot up
[2:22:51] no no no it was gonna be the money be
[2:22:52] what I believe it
[2:22:53] there's gonna be the money basically
[2:22:54] they pray and they say Amen Lord we
[2:22:58] thank you for providing he logs on to
[2:23:00] the church bank account he looks at that
[2:23:03] and he's twelve thousand dollars the
[2:23:05] Intercity
[2:23:05] praise the lord a spear now you don't
[2:23:13] know how that affected me in terms of
[2:23:15] cuz i've got the scene of me saying God
[2:23:17] doesn't really love you doesn't care
[2:23:18] about you house they can hang on hang on
[2:23:20] hang on
[2:23:20] no no I was here at the same time
[2:23:23] something laid on my heart to do that
[2:23:24] God's no no the thing that struck me was
[2:23:27] this God saw me know God saw it and
[2:23:33] Aneta strangest thing God saw it I
[2:23:34] thought wow God saw it he saw it cuz if
[2:23:40] he was intricately if he was
[2:23:42] specifically answering a need on one end
[2:23:44] he knew he knew the other end he
[2:23:46] actually saw it man I felt so good not
[2:23:49] that it happened that way
[2:23:50] that I was a part of it but that he saw
[2:23:51] it now I started thinking actually I'm
[2:23:55] not going crazy God's just dealing with
[2:23:57] me God loves me he's not hasn't left me
[2:24:00] he loves me this is all part of his plan
[2:24:02] I I didn't just do all the stuff
[2:24:04] willy-nilly it was part of his divine
[2:24:06] plan he saw he saw it that made me feel
[2:24:11] so good to know that he saw it jesus
[2:24:14] loves me this I know for the Bible tells
[2:24:15] me so
[2:24:16] I want to encourage you if you get to
[2:24:19] those times in your life God is always
[2:24:21] dealing with you and if you ever come
[2:24:24] across a brother or a sister that looks
[2:24:25] like the guys through this or going
[2:24:27] through that be careful with them be
[2:24:28] merciful that's actually when I see
[2:24:31] people go through hard times I'm like

[2:24:36] know I think you know God loves you and

[2:24:54] away from that for other things that go
