[1:06] Amen. God bless you saints. Welcome to
[1:08] the house of the Lord. Let's just stand
[1:10] this evening as we open in a word of
[1:12] prayer. I trust we've all come expecting
[1:15] tonight.
[1:17] Let's bow our heads.
[1:20] Thank you, Lord Jesus, for this
[1:22] wonderful evening you've given us, Lord.
[1:23] A day, Lord Jesus, where we knew you
[1:26] were in our midst, Lord Jesus, with us
[1:27] all every step of the way, Lord. And
[1:30] Lord, I pray that as we see, as time is
[1:33] drawing to a close, Lord Jesus, that
[1:34] we'd make our hearts ready, that we'd
[1:36] get to that spot, Lord Jesus, where we
[1:38] know that, Lord Jesus, we're ready. that
[1:41] if you come, Lord Jesus, where our
[1:42] hearts are ready, Lord Jesus, we're
[1:44] prepared, Lord, that we wouldn't just
[1:46] muck around, Lord Jesus, or just, Lord
[1:49] Jesus, doing the things that we want to
[1:50] do in life, Lord, but that we'd live to
[1:52] the cause that you've set for us, Lord
[1:54] Jesus. And um Lord, I just pray that you
[1:57] would just quicken that to our hearts,
[1:58] Lord Jesus, that would be a a real
[2:00] hungering for us to want to do that and
[2:02] a thirst, Lord Jesus, for more of you,
[2:04] Lord, to share it with the world, Lord.
[2:06] I pray that you Lord Jesus you be with
[2:08] us tonight Lord as we've come Lord to
[2:10] hear from you once again and Lord I pray
[2:12] that as we've come expected Lord that
[2:15] you speak through the minister brother
[2:16] Paul Lord Jesus and speak to our hearts
[2:19] Lord you know every need Lord Jesus and
[2:21] I pray Lord that as the musicians play
[2:23] Lord Jesus I pray you just play through
[2:25] them Lord Jesus that your atmosphere
[2:27] would come down in a mighty way this
[2:28] evening Lord Lord I pray for those that
[2:30] couldn't make it be their portion Lord
[2:32] and I pray it in Jesus name amen
[2:38] Amen.
[2:40] I saw within the city where the lamb is
[2:42] alive.
[2:44] Oh, in that city where the lamb is
[2:47] alive.

[3:15] knock.
[3:17] Another mansion over there. And we're
[3:20] free from to care. I am going where the
[3:24] lamb is the light.
[3:28] And there's a country far beyond the
[3:31] starry sky.
[3:34] And there's a city where never comes
[3:37] alive.
[3:39] And if we're faithful, we shall go by
[3:42] and by
[3:45] that city where the land is the light.
[3:49] In that city, in that city where the
[3:52] land is alive

[4:06] and care. I am going where the lamb is

[23:56] believe that you've had a good day
[23:58] today. And while we standing without any
[24:01] waste of time, let's just read. I don't
[24:04] have a PowerPoint, but uh um I I just
[24:09] felt like
[24:10] going to back to the the old school, you
[24:15] know, printing paper.
[24:17] While we standing, let's just read uh
[24:20] we'll read uh two scriptures.
[24:23] Thank you so much, Josh. That was
[24:26] wonderful. Musicians, all of you, that
[24:28] was good. God bless you richly.
[24:31] Amen. Appreciate musicians. Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; They they created an an atmosphere.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; While you come and you are full of
[24:42] traffic in your mind and you are full of
[24:46] uh listening to your body, the song
[24:48] leader comes and the musicians then they
[24:50] calm you down. Music calms you down.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; So godly music it is it even do more. So
[24:57] while we standing before all pre
[25:00] preliminaries let's just read John
[25:03] John chapter 3.
[25:08] We'll read John chapter 3
[25:13] from verse 16 and once you are there
[25:15] please say amen.
[25:19] Uh from verse 16 just two verses.
[25:23] For God so loved the world that he gave
[25:26] his only begotten son that whosoever
[25:30] believeth in him shall not perish but
[25:34] have everlasting life.
[25:37] So the word I would like you to
[25:38] underline in that verse is for God so
[25:42] loved loved the world.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Right? Just just take that part just
[25:47] just underline just bold it. Let's
[25:50] quickly go to Matthew
[25:52] then we can see it. Matthew 22.
[25:57] Matthew 22 and then verse 37.
[26:02] I can read it quickly for you.
[26:06] Verse 37.
[26:08] Uh
[26:10] Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love
[26:13] the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
[26:16] with all thy soul, and with all thy
[26:18] mind."
[26:19] This is the first and great commandment.
[26:23] And the second is like it's like unto
[26:26] it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[26:29] thyself.
[26:31] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[26:32] Lord that we can have such a privilege
[26:35] to read your word.
[26:37] I know and we all know that Lord anyone
[26:42] can read it. But it takes you to inspire
[26:44] it. It takes you Lord to anoint it. It
[26:48] takes you Lord to come and speak it
[26:51] yourself and interpret it to your
[26:54] children. It takes you my father my God
[26:56] to connect uh your word and your
[26:59] children. We cannot do anything by
[27:02] ourselves. That is why we invite you
[27:04] Lord to bless your word as we read it
[27:07] because you gave us a promise that where
[27:09] two or three are gathered in your name,
[27:11] you will be there. We therefore Lord
[27:13] pray and ask that you you also forgive
[27:15] us our wrongs Lord our mistakes our
[27:18] folly our stupidity sometimes Lord our
[27:22] ignorance I pray Lord that you forgive
[27:24] us as my brother always pray father
[27:26] forgive us even our secret sins I pray
[27:30] father as I commit each and every one of
[27:32] your children they have made an effort
[27:34] to come here Lord surely not to hear me
[27:37] but to listen to you father to connect
[27:40] with you I pray that you bless each one
[27:41] and give them each a portion Lord
[27:44] according to your promise and those that
[27:46] are also listening and streaming with us
[27:49] tonight. May you bless them. May the
[27:51] same atmosphere Lord just also anoint
[27:54] and be with their a Lord. We commit the
[27:56] rest of the service into your hands in
[27:58] the name of our loving Lord Jesus
[28:00] Christ. Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Please enjoy the
[28:04] comfort
[28:06] as I have as I have loved you. That he
[28:10] also
[28:12] Sorry, what did I say? That ye love one
[28:16] another as I have loved you. That he
[28:18] also love one another. You love one
[28:22] another as I loved you. So I want you to
[28:26] love one another. That's what the Lord
[28:27] says. As I have loved you.
[28:31] The moment you hear the word s, there's
[28:32] a comparison there. Not a comparison as
[28:34] such, but there's something that you
[28:35] need to do like the other one. The Lord
[28:37] says, "The way I love you, I want you to
[28:39] love one another like that." You
[28:42] catching it?
[28:44] Um
[28:46] uh now verse 35, he says, "By this shall
[28:49] all men know that ye are my disciples if
[28:54] you do what?
[28:56] &gt;&gt; If you love one another." So tonight
[29:00] and as we have read those three
[29:02] scriptures, I want us to speak about
[29:04] love and life.
[29:08] Love and life.
[29:10] Maybe we can just put a subcontext and
[29:12] say the ways of a perfect love. The ways
[29:15] you know how perfect love, what is it,
[29:18] how it works, what how does it affect
[29:20] us? What is this perfect love? Amen. But
[29:23] I want us to to take this title love and
[29:28] life.
[29:30] You see where we have read all those
[29:32] three scriptures have got an underlying
[29:36] factor love. The first one talks about
[29:40] uh for God so loved the world that he
[29:44] gave it his only begotten son. The
[29:46] second part talks about the greatest
[29:48] commandment that you must love the Lord
[29:52] your God. And then the third scripture
[29:55] talks about that us now loving one
[29:58] another. All of them you you you heard
[30:00] them all of them have got an underlying
[30:03] factor love.
[30:05] So let's just take that thought in our
[30:07] minds in our hearts and just relax while
[30:10] your belts are tight and just enjoy in
[30:14] the presence of God. you you know that
[30:16] there's nothing really me I can tell you
[30:18] but God can ordain something that can
[30:22] benefit you eternally just from a simple
[30:26] little service like this God can bless
[30:28] you so much and then something that you
[30:31] can even remember when we go home and
[30:33] say hey brother God used you in on that
[30:36] service for this and this and that
[30:37] because that would have been an eternal
[30:39] nugget for you amen so let's just look
[30:41] at this love and life and I'm going to
[30:45] use a physical love filio just to give
[30:49] you a comparison just to show you some
[30:52] of the features of what I'm talking
[30:53] about this love we find that h there is
[30:58] a strong relationship between love and
[31:01] life
[31:04] you we we find that there is I want to
[31:06] call it a a causal relationship you know
[31:09] when you do econometric or statistics
[31:12] they teach you about a causal link.
[31:14] There's a causal a causal. It's not just
[31:16] a relationship or a correlation. It's
[31:19] not just a a correlation. You see these
[31:21] things are just parallel there. Maybe I
[31:23] could just be pouring water out. So,
[31:26] there's a correlation. The way I pour
[31:28] water from these two bottles in a
[31:30] bucket, but but it's not they don't none
[31:35] of this causes each other to do that.
[31:37] They they're not really they don't cause
[31:39] each other to do something. they are
[31:41] just correlated or they just they just
[31:44] there's a co there's a pattern between
[31:46] these two but they don't affect each
[31:47] other. But when you talk of love and
[31:50] life, it seems to me that love and life
[31:53] there's a causal. There's one that seems
[31:55] to be causing the other,
[31:59] you know, when I say that uh ice cream
[32:04] uh there's a causal relationship between
[32:06] ice cream and milk.
[32:09] The more milk we have, the more ice
[32:10] cream we produce.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; So there's a the less milk we produce,
[32:14] we don't have much ice cream. So there's
[32:16] a causal one causes the other to happen.
[32:20] If the one goes up another so there's a
[32:22] causal link. So it seems to me you can
[32:25] look at it yourself that love and life
[32:29] goes together. You look at it
[32:30] differently as we go along with this
[32:33] with this with this discussion. Now now
[32:37] the the issue about love is that love
[32:40] creates an atmosphere.
[32:43] Okay, you'll catch me. You know when a
[32:45] husband and a wife get married and they
[32:48] love one another. Now the atmosphere
[32:50] they create at home creates life to
[32:53] happen. It it causes the atmosphere
[32:56] causes life to come. Love causes it
[32:59] seems to me that love triggers the exist
[33:02] the manifestation of how life comes or
[33:04] how life exist. Why the Bible says for
[33:07] God so loved the world. For God so loved
[33:10] the world. God loved us so much until he
[33:14] just gave himself to us.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't it? The Bible says God is love.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Huh? Is that so? The Bible says God is
[33:22] love. So God loved He gave himself. He
[33:26] He He loved us so much to a point where
[33:29] he decided to give us life. Okay. I've
[33:32] got my own theory. Actually, it's not
[33:35] mine. It's for another man
[33:38] called Dr. Steven Kovi. Dr. Steven Kovi
[33:41] said, "I don't have to you don't have to
[33:43] swallow this. I'm just sharing with you
[33:45] because I I I I actually believe what he
[33:47] said. He said love is actually a
[33:51] decision.
[33:54] Love is not some miraculous thing that
[33:57] oh at first sight I just fell." No,
[34:00] there's no such a thing. I just fell in
[34:02] love. I just automatically happened on
[34:04] on the first day. The very day I just
[34:07] just love at first sight.
[34:09] No, no, no. You're lying.
[34:11] There's no
[34:14] your decision at first sight. You
[34:17] decided to love him or to love her at
[34:19] first sight based on whatever
[34:21] information or factors or whatever
[34:23] whatever criteria you used. But why
[34:26] love? Why love is a decision mali? Love
[34:29] is a decision because if in his mind he
[34:33] decide to love you you don't know but he
[34:37] just sit there he don't know anyone he
[34:40] decides
[34:42] his criteria of loving you is different
[34:46] from the criteria of Ben loving
[34:48] Christine or loving each one have got
[34:52] their own criteria or their own way but
[34:55] you just choose to of all I don't know
[34:57] they say Women forms the bigger part of
[35:01] the population in the world. Yeah, I
[35:03] think it's 1 is to 9 or 1 is to six. I
[35:05] can't remember. Women are many. So out
[35:08] of so many billions of women, you just
[35:10] choose to love her.
[35:12] Okay. So So love is is specific, is
[35:15] purpose, is is purposeful, and is a
[35:18] decision that is well thought. I'm
[35:21] talking about genuine love. I'm talking
[35:23] about God's love. God did not just
[35:26] willy-nilly just throw everybody in
[35:29] there and just and select and select and
[35:32] then and then call that predestination.
[35:34] God carefully thought
[35:39] okay let's hold it there. Why why why
[35:42] I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm saying I agree with
[35:45] Steven Kovi. You look at different
[35:48] things. It's like he says love is
[35:50] actually a a verb. It's a verb. It's not
[35:53] a It's a doing.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; It's a doing. It's a doing word. It's
[35:57] not a It's not adjective. It's a doing
[36:01] word. It's a verb. H for love to really
[36:05] manifest itself. There must be something
[36:07] happening. You There must be something
[36:09] you do.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; There must be something happening for us
[36:13] to see that. Oh, no. No. It's because he
[36:14] loves her. It's because they love one
[36:17] another. That is why this
[36:20] Are we together? If there's no doing,
[36:22] how can how else can we see love?
[36:26] &gt;&gt; How else? So, for God so loved the world
[36:28] and he gave, you see, he loved us. What
[36:31] if God just loved us and he just kept
[36:33] quiet?
[36:35] &gt;&gt; No. No. He loved us and then he gave us
[36:38] his only begotten the way he loved us.
[36:41] So my question is, why do you love him?
[36:46] Why? Why? Why do you love God?
[36:52] Brother Colin, you know, if I had a
[36:54] billion check, I'll give it to you. Now,
[36:56] I asked my Sunday school as well. I
[36:59] can't remember who got it right. You
[37:01] see, there's nothing really that you can
[37:03] bring in return
[37:05] to compensate God's love
[37:07] &gt;&gt; or to thank him enough. Nothing. Nothing
[37:10] in you. It's like,
[37:14] okay, physically we can say, "Oh, no."
[37:17] Maggie can say, "Ah, no." Because Benny
[37:20] is is handsome. He's a nice guy. Because
[37:24] he's he's this way, this way. That's why
[37:27] you see. But the reality, the truth of
[37:29] fact of the matter, you are retaining
[37:31] his love because he first loved you.
[37:35] That is the true fact of the matter. You
[37:37] you you you love him because he first
[37:40] loved you. We love God because had it
[37:43] not been for his love, how else would we
[37:45] love him?
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Exactly. What what what will we do is
[37:49] primarily other things accepted
[37:52] but we love him because he first loved
[37:54] us and chose us. He first first of all
[37:58] Reuben loved us that was him because he
[38:02] is love. Okay. Then he gave us life. It
[38:06] seems to me again that
[38:08] life whenever you see love h it seems to
[38:12] be a trigger a trigger of life to happen
[38:16] life when where love is my mother loved
[38:20] loves trees you know she he she's got
[38:23] what they call green hands so he'll talk
[38:26] to her trees and do things to her trees
[38:28] and and one day there was this other I
[38:31] told you the story there was this other
[38:33] orange tree that was not bearing sweet.
[38:36] So she prayed for it and loved it and
[38:39] then and then eventually she just bought
[38:40] a 12 12.5 kilogram of sugar
[38:46] and she put it there on the tree on
[38:47] around the tree there. You know when we
[38:50] make a tree you put a thing to put water
[38:53] you know the ground you make the ground
[38:54] so that when you pour water the water
[38:56] can stay. So she pour it there and mix
[38:58] it up like like fertilizer and pour
[39:00] water there. And then the next season
[39:02] the fruit came sweet. So he gave it some
[39:06] love. He gave it something to be sweet
[39:09] about. Surely that sugar went there be
[39:11] processed by the tree and the soil and
[39:13] everything. All of a sudden the
[39:17] the oranges came and they were sweet. So
[39:20] where where where love is
[39:24] something called life emerge. And we
[39:27] will see how does love do that as we go
[39:30] along. Right. So that was the first page
[39:32] that I had here. Therefore I say that
[39:34] the impact of love when it permeates,
[39:36] when it goes through, when it floods,
[39:38] when it goes out, love the the the
[39:41] impact of that, it actually triggers
[39:43] life to emerge.
[39:46] You'll see what I mean by that. But you
[39:49] have already seen it because I gave you
[39:50] a practical example. I said husband and
[39:53] wife,
[39:54] it does not mean if they don't have a
[39:56] child or or there's no atmosphere of
[39:58] life. All I'm just trying to say to you,
[40:00] we see the fruits of their love.
[40:04] When love is in their home, we see the
[40:06] fruits. One of those fruits, life comes.
[40:09] Offsprings.
[40:11] You'll get me now.
[40:14] God is love.
[40:17] God is the fountain of love himself. So
[40:23] which means actually
[40:25] the God is the fountain of life.
[40:29] Because where there is love, love comes.
[40:32] So he's the fountain of life. Because
[40:35] he's the fountain of love. Now that love
[40:39] is the one that I am talking about
[40:41] today. The what we call agapo love.
[40:44] Agapo love. Aap agap love. That was
[40:47] first page. I only have six. Then we go
[40:50] home.
[40:53] Now let's go slowly. I don't want to go
[40:56] ahead of myself. I know it's prayer
[40:57] meeting but I'll be quick. They say love
[40:59] is blind. Some people say love is blind.
[41:02] I don't know if I should agree or
[41:04] disagree. They say love is blind. But
[41:06] you see what I saw is that even though
[41:08] love is blind but love is able to open
[41:10] the gates. Love opens the gate through
[41:13] faith.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Love
[41:16] love love is powerful. The prophet says
[41:18] it is the most powerful one of the most
[41:20] powerful instruments.
[41:22] Love is it. If he's blind I don't know.
[41:26] for Isaac, but it opens the gate.
[41:29] Why is it blind? Because it does not
[41:31] look at the left or the right. It does
[41:33] not It just decides. I love this one.
[41:38] Have you ever I don't know. This maybe
[41:40] could be a bad example, but
[41:44] there's no ugly human being. There's no
[41:47] ugly human being.
[41:49] But just because we humans, we like to
[41:51] say, the word ugly exists now, isn't it?
[41:54] But listen, have you ever seen an ugly
[41:56] man?
[41:58] An ugly man? Have you ever seen him? But
[42:02] maybe he's beautiful inside. But an ugly
[42:04] man married to a very beautiful woman.
[42:07] Have you ever come across? Why?
[42:11] Because love is a decision. Sometimes it
[42:14] does not even go according to the looks.
[42:16] It's a decision that is based on a
[42:19] number of things. And I don't know what
[42:23] God saw in us
[42:26] to choose and love us. I don't know what
[42:29] God saw in Jacob that he did not see in
[42:33] Esau.
[42:34] His pre p pre-elective love
[42:38] when he pre-elected. He chose what did
[42:42] God see
[42:45] to give you eternal life. Anyway, let's
[42:47] move on. The prophet says when divine
[42:50] love is projected sovereign grace takes
[42:54] place. Then I say then then faith opens
[42:57] all the blockages because love faith you
[43:00] see love is actually the the main one.
[43:03] love, faith, powerful h grace,
[43:07] everything else but love is such a
[43:09] unique thing that for me it looks to be
[43:13] the pillar or the pivot around which all
[43:16] these things are are rotating because
[43:18] without love you know in the book of
[43:21] Corinthians we'll read it at the end
[43:23] Paul says without love none of those
[43:27] nothing actually can stand without love
[43:30] that's why it says for God so loved the
[43:32] world. Who is God? God is the word. The
[43:35] one who was at the beginning, the one
[43:37] which the Bible says at the beginning
[43:38] was God was the word at the beginning.
[43:42] What was before the beginning? A big
[43:44] fountain of love that needed to be
[43:47] expressed.
[43:49] And that was and and that was God. But
[43:52] it was before he was God. It was him
[43:54] before the beginning.
[43:57] a huge fountain
[44:02] self-existing one. Amen.
[44:05] Now love actually helps you to determine
[44:10] it determines your attitude. The way you
[44:14] love that determines how your attitude
[44:16] is going to come out and your altitude.
[44:20] How high you can fly.
[44:22] Now love actually makes you to be
[44:26] humble.
[44:28] Love creates an atmosphere for you to be
[44:30] humble.
[44:33] How how is only a humble person will
[44:36] love their enemy.
[44:38] Only a humble person will love the one
[44:41] that doesn't love them. The one that you
[44:43] can look there and can kill you or
[44:45] poison you, you love that one.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; It must be very humble.
[44:53] So love
[44:56] makes you to be humble. Love, the love
[44:59] of God makes it it helps you to destroy
[45:03] giants. Giants. You know those giants
[45:06] that brother Ben spoke about here one
[45:08] time destroying the giants. The giants
[45:10] because some giants when they come they
[45:12] don't they don't appear to be giants.
[45:16] But they are giants in our lives.
[45:19] Only love, the presence of Agapolaf,
[45:24] the love of God can destroy all those
[45:27] giants. How? Look at David. The giant
[45:30] was staring at him. But David loved God
[45:33] so much that his faith and trust in God
[45:39] propelled or pushed him to destroy that
[45:41] giant. It was because of the love of
[45:45] those mighty men of valor of valor that
[45:49] made them to go and get water for David.
[45:51] It's because they loved him.
[45:56] You think they just wanted to be seen
[45:59] and be popular and be important?
[46:03] Okay, let let's just move on. I want us
[46:05] to talk about just on this one
[46:07] quotation.
[46:09] Oh, love identifies
[46:13] giants
[46:14] and it actually will single them out and
[46:17] then
[46:19] destroy them.
[46:22] Love.
[46:24] What what I mean by that is that it is
[46:26] love that actually will help you to
[46:31] generate through the atmosphere faith
[46:34] and then you'll have you won't like like
[46:37] Joshua says you know I like how he puts
[46:38] it when he was praying he says we we
[46:41] don't we don't come here to mock around
[46:46] we don't mock around we don't yeah so
[46:48] love it helps you you love God so much
[46:52] that when the enemy comes you know This
[46:54] is the trail of the enemy. The ident the
[46:56] word of God will identify the enemy,
[46:58] single him out. And then it was love
[47:02] that made Jesus to say to Peter, "Get
[47:04] thee behind me, Satan." He was not
[47:06] addressing Peter. He was addressing the
[47:09] devil who wanted to hide
[47:12] &gt;&gt; in the weakness of Peter.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; You see, so in the flesh, you could have
[47:17] said, "Ah, why is the Lord talking to
[47:18] Peter like that?" No, no. Love. He loved
[47:21] Peter so much.
[47:24] Okay, let's look at uh just just this
[47:27] one. Love creates an atmosphere.
[47:32] Brother Brennham in the message divine
[47:35] uh what is what is the same one here?
[47:38] Yeah, divine love. He says, "And that
[47:41] bull came to me just as hard as he
[47:43] could." Remember the story of the bull?
[47:45] You know the story of the bull?
[47:47] &gt;&gt; It was love that stopped the bull. It
[47:51] was not because brother Brennham is
[47:52] powerful or or anywhere. It was because
[47:55] of love. God wanted to show the prophet
[47:58] the power of love.
[48:02] Just a pure holy love in my heart.
[48:07] What did it do? It created an
[48:10] atmosphere.
[48:11] And that bull, that bull, it ran into
[48:14] that atmosphere.
[48:16] So the bull came running. It was outside
[48:19] the the outside the circle of the of of
[48:22] of love and then when it came and then
[48:24] it just went into that circle and then
[48:26] it changed everything.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; What
[48:31] love it came within the radius of love
[48:34] the bull I mean
[48:35] &gt;&gt; and then it stopped.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Can you see how powerful love is? Love
[48:41] stops a fury,
[48:44] furious, furious
[48:46] maniac
[48:48] who comes to squash brother. He came
[48:50] determined to kill him. Only love.
[48:55] You know, you know why I'm telling all
[48:56] these things? Because I know that you
[48:58] know and I understand and know that you
[49:02] know. The reason we come here is because
[49:04] we remind one another. We are here to
[49:06] encourage one another. We are here to
[49:08] remind one another to be inspired and
[49:11] anointed refilled
[49:13] again because God gave it to you and the
[49:17] enemy wants to cover it and and make it
[49:19] look shallow.
[49:21] Love is so powerful.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; It it it ran into the atmosphere and it
[49:26] stopped. Even the bull can't tell you
[49:28] why did I stop when I I went with an
[49:30] intention to kill him. Even the money I
[49:32] cannot tell you why. If we exercise that
[49:35] love
[49:38] How many are prepared to love their
[49:39] enemies? Maybe you don't have
[49:43] to one who can poison you.
[49:51] I want to love that one.
[49:54] No wonder the prophet says even if God
[49:58] can I can find myself in hell, he throws
[50:00] him hell, I I'll love him. Why? Why?
[50:03] Why? Physically speaking, Isaac, it
[50:05] doesn't make sense.
[50:07] If God throws you in hell, you love him.
[50:09] That love is so deep.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; It's deeper than all hell. Because the
[50:14] prophet, if he say, in other words, he's
[50:16] thrown in hell, he can go down through
[50:18] hell. Right at the bottom outside of
[50:20] hell, he'll find God's love.
[50:23] That's how deep. It's deeper than the
[50:24] deepest hell. You know the song,
[50:27] &gt;&gt; the love of God is so powerful.
[50:32] I read for you the story of that day.
[50:34] Now, not over 10 feet from me, he he
[50:37] stopped and he threw his feet out. He
[50:39] looked right there so defeated with that
[50:42] most meicious look on his face. He's
[50:44] telling us the story of that boy.
[50:45] Listen, brother, if a man loves God, the
[50:49] right kind of an atmosphere he could get
[50:51] into, it will produce a newborn babe.
[50:56] Just as certain as you I am here, it it
[50:59] is the atmosphere that counts. You see,
[51:02] love creates an atmosphere that can take
[51:06] you somewhere where you can't believe
[51:09] it's not selective. No, it doesn't. It
[51:12] doesn't go according to a the filo love
[51:15] criteria. You see, filio is a very
[51:17] dangerous love. We'll talk about it now.
[51:19] It's a nice love. We use it here on
[51:21] earth, but it has got a lot of
[51:23] limitations.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; It's got a lot of weaknesses, a lot of
[51:26] loopholes, a lot of gray areas. It has
[51:30] got even death inside it. Feel your
[51:33] love. So limited. So I'm telling you of
[51:36] this one that you have.
[51:39] I'll show you now that you have it. My
[51:41] time
[51:43] also brothers and sisters. Love heals.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Love it heals.
[51:53] I'll tell you a story if my wife doesn't
[51:56] mind.
[51:57] me when I'm sick.
[52:00] I just want my wife to show me that she
[52:01] loves me.
[52:03] Just to just to look at me, tell me she
[52:06] loves me, and then just that tomorrow
[52:10] I'm healed.
[52:12] That's what happens.
[52:15] You don't mind of that one, honey? So,
[52:18] if you want to be healed, get into love.
[52:22] Love and be and love heals. It will
[52:26] create an at it. It gives birth. It
[52:29] gives life. It love it. Okay. When you
[52:33] plant a plant,
[52:37] that plant has been there all the time.
[52:39] So what makes that love that that that
[52:42] plant to start growing is because inside
[52:45] it has got what we call a fountain of
[52:47] life. The gin seed it has got a love in
[52:51] it. Then it gets into an atmosphere.
[52:54] That atmosphere is the one that starts
[52:56] to make it good. But it has always been
[52:57] heavy. We are jumping into another
[53:00] aspect now.
[53:02] So it makes an atm an atmosphere is
[53:04] everything. It if you got to create an
[53:08] atmosphere and you your faith will do
[53:11] it.
[53:12] Love will create that atmosphere of
[53:15] faith and your faith will open the
[53:17] gates. You love so much so that faith
[53:23] comes out because in love inside love
[53:26] there's built everything is built up in
[53:28] there but you need an atmosphere for
[53:30] each one of them to come for faith for
[53:33] grace to love your enemy to destroy your
[53:36] enemy to get healed to everything is
[53:40] built in that God who is love is in
[53:43] there it's just for you to access it
[53:46] including gifts
[53:50] Amen.
[53:54] The atmosphere of faith, the atmosphere
[53:56] of life, the atmosphere of forgiveness,
[53:58] the atmosphere of healing, the
[54:00] atmosphere of grace, the atmosphere
[54:02] atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere.
[54:05] That's what love creates. It creates an
[54:07] atmosphere
[54:10] of positive thinking.
[54:13] What what else can I mention? Love can
[54:16] create an atmosphere where your boss,
[54:19] they will give you an increase.
[54:23] You love them so much so and that will
[54:26] create an atmosphere. It will create an
[54:29] atmosphere that people who are swearing
[54:31] when they are next to you, they just
[54:32] say, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't
[54:34] mean to talk like that." Why? Because
[54:36] you you you create an atmosphere. But
[54:38] no, no, no, no, no. We want to some
[54:41] Okay, I'll leave that one.
[54:44] I want to speak nice only tonight.
[54:47] Um,
[54:50] love. The Bible said that God so loved
[54:53] the world. We read this one. Now, God
[54:55] loves the world and God is love. And
[54:58] when God project himself to the world to
[55:02] save the world, there could be nothing
[55:05] else but sovereign grace.
[55:10] So was grace going to come if God did
[55:12] not love?
[55:15] No.
[55:17] Was healing going to come? Was life
[55:19] going to come? Was everything that you
[55:21] need going to come if God did not love
[55:23] you?
[55:24] But the first commandment he said love
[55:27] God. You bring that love back with all
[55:29] your mind. In other words, with all your
[55:32] your mind, your soul and your heart. So
[55:35] meaning body, soul and spirit. with your
[55:38] outside body to start with. But people
[55:41] must know that ah this man loves God.
[55:45] From the outside it's not there's
[55:46] nothing like no it's just inside. From
[55:48] the outside people must know every day
[55:50] of my life people must know that that
[55:52] one is that full foolish Christian
[55:55] that you know that foolish boy man
[55:58] called Samson that foolish Christian.
[56:01] Yeah that's how they must address me and
[56:03] I feel so good about it because I'm I
[56:06] love God. So the the world because the
[56:09] love of God is stupidity to the world is
[56:11] stupidness. What do you call wise and
[56:15] wisdom? The world says foolishness.
[56:18] Why? Because you have the love of God.
[56:20] The world does not know it. They don't
[56:22] have it. I I must love them until they
[56:26] love him.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Love also do very very very ridiculous
[56:34] things.
[56:36] love it makes ridiculous things. It just
[56:40] release a man from the cross who are
[56:42] supposed to die and say that man must go
[56:44] for free for free. Okay. Anyway, what
[56:48] did you do? Look, if there's anything
[56:50] that me
[56:52] I have done, I the Lord should have just
[56:54] destroyed me. But instead, he loves me
[56:56] with all what I've done.
[57:00] With all what you have done and what you
[57:01] have been and he still loves you just by
[57:05] being born, you already sinful, supposed
[57:06] to die, Sister Wii, we were supposed me
[57:09] and you were supposed to go down.
[57:12] We were born guilty.
[57:14] But no, he he already had a plan before.
[57:16] We didn't know. He had a plan for us
[57:19] where he pre pre-ordained us to come and
[57:22] show his love. Otherwise, if we didn't
[57:24] come this route, that love wasn't going
[57:27] to be manifested and be sin today.
[57:30] That's the reason why we were born
[57:31] sinners. We were not born sinners
[57:33] because u well we were born guilty but
[57:36] actually it was for the purpose of God.
[57:38] You understand me my sister?
[57:42] Now I was saying go love makes
[57:45] unbelievable things ridiculous sometimes
[57:48] and
[57:54] when when when when a king is born when
[57:57] when you go now to the UK cuz that's the
[58:00] well-known royal family we know there's
[58:02] other royal families when you go there
[58:04] and they say you know you know little
[58:06] Prince William uh when he was going to
[58:09] be born. It was a big project, my
[58:12] friend. It had a big government budget
[58:15] because a prince is going to be born. A
[58:18] king, a future king is going to be born.
[58:23] So everything is prepared. Doctors and
[58:25] professors make research to understand
[58:28] the dynamics of how the king should be
[58:30] born.
[58:32] But this king
[58:34] so ridiculously was just born in a
[58:37] manger.
[58:39] He he he does ridiculous things. He He's
[58:42] a simple simple king. Simple is an
[58:46] understatement. Hey, this one was not
[58:48] born that the way that we will imagine a
[58:51] king should be born. But yet he was the
[58:53] king of all kings, but he was born in
[58:57] such a way. Who could believe
[59:01] he was in heaven and he was called
[59:03] Michael?
[59:05] You know he was more humble than than
[59:07] Lucifer.
[59:09] Lucifer was
[59:11] he even thought that he actually can
[59:13] overthrow this guy. He didn't have the
[59:15] revelation to know that this is my
[59:17] actually my creator. He's just in a body
[59:20] of Michael. When he took that office and
[59:21] he was Michael the he was an angel
[59:24] Michael. Lucifer thought ah he can be
[59:26] better than him. He's Lucifer is
[59:28] beautiful. He's looks shining. He's got
[59:30] a singing gift everything
[59:33] and he's on the second hand of God and
[59:35] he thought ah this Michael
[59:38] was humble
[59:40] but he was the very very God who made
[59:43] him and Lucifer did not have the
[59:44] revelation. So God is very humble but
[59:48] inside there there's everything inside
[59:51] he's so simple that they miss him.
[59:55] He was born in a manger
[1:00:00] wrapped up in swaddling what do you call
[1:00:02] cloths and everything.
[1:00:06] He he he just sent a man with a a stick
[1:00:11] to go and take over an empire.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; That's ridiculous, isn't it?
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; That's unbelievable. That's
[1:00:20] unacceptable. It even depleted for
[1:00:22] Pharaoh. He didn't know what this guy
[1:00:25] Yeah. I mean really are you must be just
[1:00:28] bring psychologist to check him.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; No no I've come to to take over and take
[1:00:32] my people go.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Ah are you okay sir? So that's how the
[1:00:39] love of God works. It makes ridiculous
[1:00:42] things ridiculous. Unbelievable things.
[1:00:47] Down page three.
[1:00:50] Let's talk about this filio love. You
[1:00:52] see
[1:00:54] Filio and Agapul sometimes we must be
[1:00:57] very careful. Sometimes we
[1:01:00] you know we all love our children
[1:01:03] but actually we should love our children
[1:01:05] with agap.
[1:01:08] We should actually be loving our
[1:01:09] children with agap love. We should be
[1:01:11] loving our husbands and our wives with
[1:01:13] agapol love because fo love fails. Fil
[1:01:17] love is a love here for here. the one
[1:01:20] that I love my wife, the one that I love
[1:01:22] my children. But it's so limited.
[1:01:25] If a man takes another man takes another
[1:01:28] man's wife, you will see filio love. He
[1:01:31] will shoot him
[1:01:33] and kill him. That's filio love. He
[1:01:36] loves his wife so much that another man
[1:01:38] take his wife and he just kill him. He's
[1:01:40] got jealousy in it. It's got weaknesses.
[1:01:44] The love of God has got no those things.
[1:01:47] But sometimes, can I can I just throw a
[1:01:50] throw a little bomb? Sometimes we use
[1:01:52] feel your love to love God.
[1:01:55] We don't we can't do that. So sometimes
[1:01:58] we we we take feel your love and we want
[1:02:00] to use it to love God. You know why?
[1:02:04] Because feel your love is you do for me,
[1:02:06] I do for you.
[1:02:09] Feel your love inside it's got a builtin
[1:02:11] mechanism where if you I can't really
[1:02:14] benefit, I can't really love you. It's
[1:02:17] it's a selfcentered selfish love. It's
[1:02:20] not a selfless feel your love if you
[1:02:22] check it carefully.
[1:02:24] Ah if I don't benefit ah why?
[1:02:28] And sometimes it has hides those things
[1:02:30] that oh I love you so much with the love
[1:02:32] of the Lord my dear brother. No no no I
[1:02:35] mean if you borrow me your car.
[1:02:40] Oh brother Ben I appreciate you so much.
[1:02:42] I I love because I know I want to build
[1:02:45] a house.
[1:02:47] You see, so I say, "Oh, this brother
[1:02:50] loves me. Such a wonderful man of God."
[1:02:52] Three months down the line, "Hey,
[1:02:53] brother, you know, as the Lord leads me,
[1:02:55] I would you help me?" Then the brother
[1:02:57] gives me a good quotation
[1:03:00] that that's fel
[1:03:04] sometimes feel your love. If you cannot
[1:03:08] if you hate me, feel your love actually
[1:03:11] cannot give love back. It hasn't got
[1:03:13] that ability. So we're talking of agap
[1:03:17] the one that is God himself.
[1:03:21] Did I say it right? Was that that was
[1:03:23] not a strong powerful bomb. Fil love is
[1:03:25] like that.
[1:03:27] So the children of God we are given
[1:03:30] divine love. Agapo love and is part of
[1:03:34] what we are given in this kingdom.
[1:03:37] Filo love actually.
[1:03:40] Okay, I think I've spoken a lot about
[1:03:42] feel love. But what I want to say here
[1:03:44] is that
[1:03:46] when divine love is in your heart, there
[1:03:48] is a difference in your life. Everybody
[1:03:51] can see that this person is different.
[1:03:54] You you you live like a Christian. You
[1:03:56] act like a Christian. You walk like a
[1:03:58] Christian. You do everything like as a
[1:04:00] Christian should do. You you're not
[1:04:02] ashamed to be called a Christian. Your
[1:04:06] God is God. not other things takes
[1:04:09] priority because the Bible says love
[1:04:11] your the Lord your God with all that's
[1:04:13] the first thing so the first priority
[1:04:16] every day of when you wake up when you
[1:04:18] do things when your status whatever you
[1:04:20] do should be about him should reflect
[1:04:23] him if you do things that don't reflect
[1:04:26] him that don't bring honor to him do you
[1:04:29] love him with all your outside or just
[1:04:31] the spirit and it's is is minimal Ah
[1:04:43] and also
[1:04:46] that love cast out fear.
[1:04:50] It cast fear away. Fear cannot stand in
[1:04:52] the presence of agapola or divine love
[1:04:55] that we are talking of. It can't
[1:04:57] just it just it's not just possible.
[1:05:00] It's not even about whether brother bell
[1:05:02] you want or not. At the moment a he puts
[1:05:06] himself in you. Fear just just cannot
[1:05:09] until a man writes a song and said fear.
[1:05:12] What did he say? Zack. Zack. I like
[1:05:15] Zack. You know if I can meet him one day
[1:05:18] I'll ask him to sing for me. He he he
[1:05:21] spoke about fear. Fear. What is fear?
[1:05:26] He's he's a liar.
[1:05:28] He's a liar. fear. He can't stand in the
[1:05:31] presence of agap. So the the key thing
[1:05:34] is have agap have that divine love and
[1:05:38] you tell me
[1:05:43] love believes
[1:05:45] doesn't doubt it. It love believes
[1:05:49] it believes everything.
[1:05:51] You love me. Yes, I believe you.
[1:05:54] You tell me everything. I'll buy you a
[1:05:56] train and an airplane. Yes, I believe
[1:05:59] you.
[1:06:01] Until another man said, "Okay, after
[1:06:03] after another lady said after buy me the
[1:06:04] train and then the rail,
[1:06:08] who's going to build the rail for me?"
[1:06:10] He was believing everything. Yes.
[1:06:18] We're going to I want I'm going to read
[1:06:19] this one and then then we read
[1:06:21] Corinthians.
[1:06:24] Then we read Corinthians. Then we go
[1:06:26] into prayer.
[1:06:32] Love is one of the greatest instrument.
[1:06:34] Remember I told you and there is
[1:06:38] is is one of the greatest instruments
[1:06:40] that there is in God's great economy.
[1:06:45] God himself is love. The Bible said that
[1:06:48] he is love. And when he he when you
[1:06:50] become one of his children,
[1:06:53] you become part of that love. Isn't that
[1:06:57] wonderful? You are part of God's economy
[1:07:00] now. Once you become his child, you are
[1:07:04] in God's economy. And it is one of the
[1:07:06] biggest instruments. So it is a
[1:07:08] magnificent thing to be a son and a
[1:07:12] daughter of God because it shows the
[1:07:14] love that is in you. So never allow the
[1:07:18] enemy to to say to you, you don't have
[1:07:21] the love of God. In fact, what you need
[1:07:23] to do every day is to say, "Love, Lord,
[1:07:26] give me more of your love.
[1:07:29] Give me more of your love. Increase for
[1:07:31] me every day." That's what you and me
[1:07:33] should be doing. Let me love the
[1:07:35] unlovable. Let me love the stinking
[1:07:38] street people that I see there in
[1:07:40] Courtney Place. Let me love those ones.
[1:07:43] love them to a point where they just
[1:07:45] want to go with me and I bring them to
[1:07:49] to him.
[1:07:51] Love is very ridiculous. It's very he
[1:07:54] doesn't choose who love. He doesn't love
[1:07:56] according to oh Reuben is my friend.
[1:07:59] Doesn't classify people. You know you
[1:08:01] heard on Sunday that in God's kingdom we
[1:08:05] we don't have categories.
[1:08:07] There's no categories of this group,
[1:08:10] that group. No, no, that's not God's
[1:08:11] love.
[1:08:13] God's love. We are all the same and
[1:08:15] wonderful. That's how it works. It's so
[1:08:18] powerful that once you've got the enemy
[1:08:20] can bring a root of bitterness,
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; love eradicates it so quick.
[1:08:28] If you're the son of God, it removes it
[1:08:30] clean better than the detergent. That's
[1:08:33] how love works. Because the root of
[1:08:36] bitterness will always wants to come and
[1:08:39] every time it comes many fall many trips
[1:08:43] but no the root of bitterness the Bible
[1:08:45] when it comes it you it must find that
[1:08:47] there is a love
[1:08:50] and it can't stand there
[1:08:52] it will not take hold of any Christian
[1:08:56] or god-fearing person when any root of
[1:08:59] bit I don't know why I'm going that
[1:09:00] route I mean that that direction but
[1:09:01] what I want to say is that any type of
[1:09:03] evil
[1:09:05] H plantations or anything that the enemy
[1:09:07] can bring once it finds love.
[1:09:11] It just the formula does not work. That
[1:09:14] formula does not work for the devil. So
[1:09:16] the formula is divine love. Huh? Divine
[1:09:20] love. Huh? Divine love. Huh? Divine
[1:09:23] love. Because it just opens up all what
[1:09:27] you want. It just gives everything. It
[1:09:30] brings you a healing. It takes away your
[1:09:32] stress levels. It gives you a That's why
[1:09:34] there's a reason why God says love the
[1:09:36] Lord your God with your mind, your
[1:09:38] heart, and your soul. Because that love
[1:09:40] of God, it even heals your body, your
[1:09:43] outside body. You just say, "Brother
[1:09:45] Paul, isn't it keto?" No, no, no, no,
[1:09:47] no. It's not keto. I'm just shining and
[1:09:48] nice. I'm nice because of the love of
[1:09:50] God.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's that's how the love of God works.
[1:09:55] You say, "Ah, sister, nowadays you're
[1:09:57] glowing." Hey, hey, analyst. Oh, no.
[1:09:59] It's the love of God.
[1:10:02] Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That's how it was it. But if you don't
[1:10:05] have the love of God,
[1:10:07] what happens? They say, "I don't want to
[1:10:09] look at that guy, man. He's always
[1:10:10] angry. That guy is not in the mood
[1:10:12] today." The love of God does not have
[1:10:15] moods. And the the love of God, the love
[1:10:19] of God goes above even all your
[1:10:22] hormones. It goes above. Just love him
[1:10:25] more. You'll see.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; It goes above everything. Whether a man
[1:10:30] grows or goes younger or he's old or a
[1:10:32] woman is old or it just the love of God
[1:10:35] just command it opens all the doors. It
[1:10:37] creates an atmosphere to tell the that
[1:10:39] hormone that hey you love of God.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; That's how the formula works for the for
[1:10:44] the divine love. So it is the actually
[1:10:47] what is the the word called for
[1:10:49] medicine? It is the the dose. It is the
[1:10:53] antidote. Thank you. It is the antidote
[1:10:57] of everything in our lives. The love of
[1:11:00] God. We're going to stop now. I won't
[1:11:02] ask you to open that scripture. But
[1:11:04] listen to this. First Corinthians 13.
[1:11:06] Though I can speak with tongues of men
[1:11:09] and of angels and have no charity. Me,
[1:11:12] I'm talking to me here. If anything I'm
[1:11:14] saying, you don't necessarily agree with
[1:11:16] me. Just know that I'm actually
[1:11:18] referring to myself.
[1:11:20] Okay? But I know you agree with me. If I
[1:11:25] I am become a I'm becoming a sounding
[1:11:27] brass and a thinking a tingly symbol.
[1:11:30] And though I I I I have gift of prophecy
[1:11:33] and understand all mysteries and all
[1:11:35] knowledge though I have all faith faith
[1:11:40] so that I could remove mountains and
