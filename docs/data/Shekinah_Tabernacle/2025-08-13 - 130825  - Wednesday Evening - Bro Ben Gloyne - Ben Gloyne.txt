Thank you, musicians. Amen. Good evening, everyone. God bless you. Good to see you still here, Vicki. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen. Let's um turn into the scriptures. We've got prayer uh prayer meeting tonight. We just want to go to um Second Peter chapter 1. Again, I don't have a PowerPoint. Sorry. So, we're going to do this the oldfashioned way. So, second Peter and 1 and then we're going to go to um Isaiah 55 as well. So, second Peter 1 and verse 8. Amen. I trust you've all had a good start to the week so far. Everyone's happy. Everyone's good. Yes. Praise the Lord. Amen. First uh 2 Peter 1 and8 I'm in first Peter. That's not going to help. Let's try that again, shall we? 1 Peter 1 and8. He says, "For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather brethren, give diligence to make your calling election sure. For if ye do these things, you shall never fall. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them and be established in the present truth. Amen. And then Isaiah 55 and verses 8 to 11. So Isaiah 55 and verse 8. Amen. All right. It says here, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as a rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returnneeth not thither, but waterth the earth, and maketh it bring forth, and bud, that it may give seed to the sewer, and bread to the eater. So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning. If you have a need, you just want to lift your hands. Say, Lord, don't pass me by this night. Come to where I am. Almighty God, as we bow our heads in your presence, we thank you, Lord. We can come into the middle of the week and we can gather as a people praising and worshiping you, Lord. And truly, Lord Jesus, our desire is to honor you, to worship you with all that we are. So I ask, Father, may you take our lives now, Lord. Cover us in your blood. Forgive us of our sins and our wrongs, our trespasses. And I just pray, dear God, you just give a special grace tonight, Lord. And may you just come anoint your word to our lives, Lord. Anoint speaker and hearer. Anoint those who are listening by the way of the stream as well. Be their portion, dear God. We just want to commit all of our lives into your hands. Have your way. speak to all of our hearts in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats uh tonight. So, I want to I want to talk a bit about uh and and I pray this all comes together. I was thinking about um Brother Isaac's sermon last Wednesday and about remembering and and I just, you know, and and I just want to kind of follow in that theme if I can have that liberty to do so. Um because we got to really remember God has God has spoken incredible things. And now I'm just going to talk about our local assembly here. Amen. God has spoken incredible things. He's spoken incredible sermons uh at camp. Doesn't matter who's been speaking. God has deposited incredible amounts of word into our lives. He has spoken directly to our hearts. And maybe it's just even a phrase in a service, but it just kind of explodes into your heart. It changes your life. God has done incredible things. Now, we know when God speaks, he doesn't just do it to vibrate sound waves to occupy some sound space. He speaks deliberately on purpose. He, you know, he's got a purpose in doing it. He doesn't speak just to fill sound or fill time. But there's a purpose for it. And we know his word, as Jesus says, the words I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life. So, his words are life, eternal life that goes forth. And they have transformed our lives. They've changed us. I'm sure we can all agree that God has done incredible things. Now, this is why I took this from from from Peter here. He says, "I want to stir you up in remembrance of these things." Because, you know, our God has not left. Amen. He's not departed. He hasn't left us somewhere. You know, our God is still speaking. He's still dealing. He's still working. Remember, he is the great I am. Amen. He wasn't the I was or the will, but he's the great I am. He's the present God. And I'm sure that we can just rejoice a bit tonight just to think about what he has done in our lives and what he's doing. Amen. Because as as we read there in um Peter um you know we had it there where it says this you know that you I was looking into this word now yeah I just pray this kind of comes together but it says that um uh verse 9 here but he that lackth these things is blind and cannot see a far off. Now that word um those words cannot see far off is actually one Greek word which is a compound of two words and one is actually the mysteries you know it's mystery and then the other part is their eyes are closed. So this word meaning they cannot see a far off is they cannot see the mystery of God revealed. They cannot see Christ in you the hope of glory. Right? So we are blessed that we can say we can see. I mean God's word has given us light. He's opened our eyes. I mean our eyes of understanding. It wasn't you or me or anyone that decided I'm going to be a believer and I can see what God has spoken in this day. God sovereignly has come to you anointed your eyes with Isa. open your eyes that you can see what he's doing in this day. That's an incredible thing. Amen. That we have eyes of understanding that we are not blind but we can see. Amen. Because people may look at you when you talk about the very Lord of glory dwelling in flesh and they say that's just too much. But that's Christ in you the hope of glory. I mean it's more than as I said a while a few Sundays ago. It's more than just saying you know a part of God is in you. You know the fullness of all that God is is in his bride. Amen. So, so and and also he says as we read in Isaiah, his word will not return unto him void. So, his word is going to perfect the people. Amen. It will it will make a people fully mature. Amen. We're not going to be adolescent believers. We're going to be fully mature believers. God's word is doing it. Amen. It's not you and I doing it. It's God maturing us through his word. I mean, it's God growing us. God giving us vitamins. God feeding us. God sustaining us. Amen. Till we grow into the stature of the fullness of Christ. Praise the Lord. Amen. Because that's what his word is going to do in this day. And that's what his word has done in this day. Remember, this message is an adoption message. It's a placing message, placing you in your predestinated part of the body of Christ. Amen. I'm so thankful for that. I'm sure you are too. Amen. That remember, it's the word that's doing it. His word. You know, there's a song, his word is working mightily in me. Amen. And I'm sure you've got the testimony. His word is working mightily in me. Amen. It's doing a great work. It's molding me. It's molding my character into his character. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, I just want to I just want to, you know, just a few things that, you know, really struck me. You I was just kind of going down memory lane, you know, today as I was driving down doing the school pickup. I was going down memory lane about what has God done in our midst. You know, he's done a lot. And um one of the things that really jumped out to me is because I've actually got it written down, but you know uh you know you well when we first started you know we uh had the tongues interpretation where the Lord says if you remain humble my word will go forth and I'll bring my people here and they'll find rest for their souls. It was the first prayer meeting we had I think way back in 2012. And then it was just a few years ago when when um when the Lord spoke again in that manner and and he said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, my word came forth in this place when you were first began. If you keep humble before me, my word will continue to come. It will find souls and they'll find rest. That is why I have called you today to humble thyself again before me. There are souls that need my rest. You must be humble before me and they shall find their rest. I have not left. And I believe that is still as powerful and as true today as it was a couple of years ago when it was spoken. So it so you know I I think this should really stir us up. Lord, make us humble. Not a not a not a false humility, but a genuine Holy Ghost humility that God can find his people and they can enter rest. Because he says there's souls that must find rest. Amen. And he says if you remain humble, he says he says um it will fi my word will come will continue to come. It will find souls and they'll find rest. Amen. That's amazing. He's saying that his word will find those souls and they'll find that rest. Amen. They'll receive the true sealing of God, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. This is a this is a very uh incredible thing where I could say this is one of the mysteries of God. how God and man can unite because in the scripture just going just just referring back to second Peter again with that word cannot see a far off and the word mysteries. So a mystery in the Bible or in the scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but uh but in which a supernatural element still remains. So so something that's been hidden it's been revealed and there's a supernatural element in the unveiling. Amen. That will transform a life. So, so we can see we can see a far off. So, we can see the mystery of Christ revealed in you and I. And the supernatural element is that he anoints that word and makes it live in our lives. Amen. He produces himself in a people. Now, just just just going back, you know, I know it's prayer meeting, so I won't be very long tonight, but I just want to stir up our remembrance a bit about some things that have been spoken. I mean, brother Kyre would speak uh quite a few years ago. Uh this is back in Stokes Valley. He preached a sermon called to be continued. How how how the devil never has the final say. You know it's like our life is like a drama and you know there's always if you ever watch like me you watch television you come to the end of an episode and become to a climactic you know dramatic bit and it looks like the enemies you know the bad guys is going to win or something and they just flash across the screen to be continued. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the story wasn't over right. And it's the same thing with our lives. We can come to a point where we just basically like, you know, the Israelites against the Red Sea and it looks like all is lost. But then the to be continued comes along. Why? Because God always has the last say. Amen. The devil never gets the last word. God always gets the last word in everything. Amen. Praise the Lord. Camp, you know, I think it was 2019, Brother Kyra again preaching and he had a photo and I couldn't find it, but there was a there was a weed growing in his pastor's backyard. It looked like a tree. It was so big. And this thing was growing there and his wife told him, you know, you should cut this thing down. But he just left this thing growing and eventually it became like a tree and and then and then and then the pastor's dog used to get shade under this weed. And so the pastor reasoned, well, it's it's it's it's should stay there cuz it's looking after the dog. And you know, but then eventually the dog died and the weed was still there. And then eventually, you know, he cut the thing down. But that thing grew for years and years and it should have been gotten rid of. But but but the but he allowed it to grow on his land. And how many times, you know, you may think, "Oh, that's just a nice story." And whatever God was speaking to us, saying, "Don't let things grow in your life. Don't let weeds grow. Don't reason." Cuz reasoning will always protect something. And if you think it's part of you, you'll always allow it to grow there. Amen. But you got to cut that thing out. Not just cut it down. Cut out the roots and everything. Don't let things in your life grow that are not part of the word of God &gt;&gt; because they'll end up as a big problem. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can I can I can trim this thing. I can look after it." know that thing will ruin you. So why not get rid of it? Amen. I to me that's immensely powerful. Amen. We had um you know brother Kyro preach again issues and open doors. The reason we have issues in our lives is because we open a door to the devil. Why not close those doors? Let God seal them over. We don't need issues. Amen. So this is just you know mocking worship. how the how the you know there was a uh the Italian band of soldiers took Jesus and they said they mocked him and they worshiped him putting the crown of thorns on him and all these things. How people can mock God by their worship by not letting their word change them. Amen. Brother Johnny Demoff preaching the three little pigs. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. And then you know um you know brother Kyra again you know I know a lot of these you'd had to be there for the atmosphere but immensely powerful things. You know, you're preaching about how there's all the uh redeemed waiting in paradise and finally the thief in the cross comes through the door and they're under expectation God's going to walk in and then finally the door comes open and the presence of God always precedes him. Amen. And then he physically walked in. Who remembers that kind of thing? See the powerful atmosphere. I remember standing there at the end of that service and you know all the musicians are behind me and and and I said, "Okay, let's let's uh sing a song." And they're just so caught up in worshiping God. I thought, "Well, we're not going to sing tonight." It was so powerful. Amen. But but God was doing those things to remind us, I'm with you. Amen. This is more than theatrics or or or it's not even theatrics, but it's more than just man doing something. But God is trying to deposit something into you. Amen. That his word is true. His word is right. And he's here for you to meet your need. And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Brother Alpha preaching about redemption by blood. Who remembers that service at camp? I mean, many of us were transformed in that service. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm just wanting to stir up your remembrance. Our God hasn't left. We can get to a point where we forget these things of God moving in the reality of his presence. And you know, we can forget those things. I know I'm guilty of it. Amen. But I just I just want to stir you up a little bit with these things. Amen. We Yeah. Where brother Alpha preached, you know, redemption by blood and many of the young people up and praising God. And who was changed in that meeting? Amen. where you know you know the Lord called out one of the young brothers in church saying you've told a lie and you know make it right with your parents and I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost. Who remembers that? Incredible things happened there. God was telling my blood redeems. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How about you know brother Chris Moritz preaching about you know it's bear season. &gt;&gt; It's bear season. We actually have the photo of that one. Well I don't have it here but you know it's on the PowerPoint but anyway, you know it's bear season. So, in other words, God is telling us it is open season on the devil. You can go hunt him if he's on your ground. You've got the sign off. You've got the ride off. You got the ticket. You've got the whatever it is that gives you the lawful right to go hunt a bear. It's bear season. It's open season on the devil. Amen. You have a right to take the word of God, blast them out of the blast. Amen. Kill them, skin them, make him a throw rug on your floor to be a conversation piece when people come into your home. that that a testimony becomes I mean that that an enemy that's been fighting you becomes a testimony in your life. Amen. It is still bear season. That season never closes. Amen. How about when you know when he preached on Abigail in the um Nabal how Abigail was married to Nabal and you know Nabal um means a fool and you know how how someone has to be you know their first husband has to die before they can be you know married to Christ which is David. Abigail's husband Nibal died then so she could marry David. And Nibal means a fool. And our first birth is a full. Our first nature is a fool. This guy's got to die. She can be married to another. Amen. And you know there's many countless more sermons that have been preached that God has been speaking directly on time on point speaking things that people talk about driving to church or talking about or conversations or Sunday school countless times. I wish we could, you know, it probably would have become so common if if you know the Sunday school teachers got up at the end of the service and say, "We just taught that. He just preached it. We didn't talk about it." &gt;&gt; Why? God is trying to get your attention. I mean, he's trying to stir your remembrance. My blood works. I'm here for you. My word is true. Amen. I am more than able to fulfill it. And we can go through the testimonies of supernatural healings and deliverance and all these kind of things. Our God is on time. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need to fear nothing. We don't need to worry. I just want to encourage you tonight. God is more. Whatever you're going through, God is more than able. Don't sit there in some, you know, negative slump. That's the devil trying to make you forget what God has done. Cuz remember, if he's if you know, the Lord has spoken to us. He's drawn us. He's saved us. He's redeemed us. Amen. And he's done that. And he can't lose us. &gt;&gt; That's one thing our Lord can't do. He can't lie. And he can't lose one of his. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I'm So so I believe I'm looking at some of his tonight. Amen. So you may be in a valley, you won't stay in the valley. Amen. You may be going through a great fire or river or whatever it is, but God will not leave you there. Amen. Remember, he always he always gives an experience before you go down into a trial like Jesus, you know, Jesus with Peter, James, and John mount transfiguration, right? They're up on the mountain. They have that trans mount transfiguration experience. Then they go down off the mountain and and you know there's problems down in the valley. God equips equipped them before they went down there. Amen. We are never coming up short. Our God is more than able in every single situation. So I just wanted to share those tonight. &gt;&gt; Our God has done many things. This will be what be your third anniversary this camp, brother Colin? &gt;&gt; Third, &gt;&gt; second year. He's a witness, &gt;&gt; right? Things we take for granted. Oh, it's camp again and we love it. It's amazing. But someone who hasn't experienced it comes experienced like this is the greatest thing ever and we know it is, right? We got to remember the pillar of fire is very present where where where his word is. Brother Bram says, "The pillar of fire accompanies the message always." Amen. So where the truth of the message is preached, the pillar of fire is there to vindicate that word. Always. Amen. You go to some other places. I've been to Pentecostal churches in Chile. They look like us. They talk like us. They're very wonderful Christian people. But the pillar of fire is not there because they denominated. You know the thing that Isusa Street, there was a common warning. Brother Colin brought this to my attention. Brother Lonnie was teaching and I and I had to Google it to look. But there was a common thing in the June during the ISUsa street revival. There was a warning by the spirit of God. If you denominate, I'm going to leave. That's why we must never denominate. Put a full stop behind what we believe. We got to keep walking in the light and let him unfold his word to us as we walk. Amen. I'm sure I could I could add a lot of, you know, list to these things. you know, monumental seasons and times here. And I believe we're living in a monumental season. &gt;&gt; God is still on the throne in charge working in our lives. But I just want you to just maybe this week go think back. Think back in your Christian walk. Make a list. &gt;&gt; Make a I tell you what, you'll be dancing after a while, &gt;&gt; but make a list of what he has done, what he has spoken. You say, "I need a big book." That's fine. Get a big book. But take a take take stock about what he has done. We're all from different parts of the world. God didn't start here, right? God started wherever you started because he's always been with you, right? But take stock about what he's done. I tell you what, your faith will go through the roof. Cuz what he started, he will perfect. He will complete in the day of Jesus Christ. He won't leave you half done. Right? He never leave us in the wilderness. We We're promised lamb babies. Amen. In Christ, in the son of man, living in our inheritance. Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad you can see? Aren't you glad God's word will not return to him void? Amen. This bride will be produced exactly how he ordained it in his word without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. That's you. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's um let's have the musicians. I just wanted to share that with you tonight. He's done great things. Amen. How many answered prayers have we had from these prayer meetings? How many countless prayers God is? You know, it it always makes me feel this big when I think about God is sovereign. God's not a democracy. Not all the lobbying in the world can make a move. He's not some crooked politician. He's sovereign. So, if he chooses to do something, he does it. So, I'm so thankful for our God. He would listen to you and I listen to me. I mean, it's the blood that, you know, puts us on speaking terms, right? It's all his doing. He wants us in his presence and more than we want to be in his presence. But you think about the countless testimonies and prayers answered and God undertaking, not just for people here, but around the world. We're we're such a I mean, he's so good. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, let's let's stand, shall we? I want to sing the song um goodness of God and then we'll go through the prayer request and we'll have a time of prayer. Amen. I've lived in the goodness of God. I'm still living in his goodness. Amen. I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. [Music] All my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head. Oh, I have live in the goodness of God. [Music] Hallelujah. All my life you have been faithful. [Music] All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; I love your voice. [Music] You have led me through the fire and in darkest night. You are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. I have lived in the goodness of God. All my love [Music] and all my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] Cuz your goodness is running after. It's running after me. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me.
