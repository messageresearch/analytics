let us taste of that heavenly home Oh father may Lord tonight Lord you just come down in a special way forgive us Lord if we've done anything wrong any attitudes any inhibitions Lord anything of restriction or barrier or anything father all the things that we are ignorant of even Lord that we are doing that we don't even know Father forgive us Lord for this our blood that is dripping hallelujah Oh Lord that we are so dependent on father that would enable fellowship friendship Communion and engagement in Lord oneness without God for in this day we know Lord that you're in the father and we're in you and you're enough Lord I pray father that tonight you would just speak Lord according to your perfect will take control of every spirit in this place I pray Lord Jesus that no one in this room would leave the same I pray Lord that we would hear from our king and that Lord if there's any stones in the way that would be rolled away so that there can be a clear connection with the Resurrection tonight that there would be nothing to hinder Lord but father just as we Lord trust a surgeon to put us to sleep an open our body to fix something Lord we want to lay on the operating table of the Great's of physician tonight and let you Lord we want to let go tonight and let you wherever we're at Lord tonight father where I am Lord you know we were at nothing is hidden from you and tonight Lord we want to lay on your operating table and say Lord whatever you have that you would like to do in this place tonight we want to yield to you O Lord may this be a night where procrastination and delay would be Lord laid aside and there would be an action upon the word and as you express yourself tonight lord I pray that you would call your bride to attention and and Lord

father hole call us to attention Lord let us father as it were see beyond the curtain of time let us experience Lord what the prophet Elijah that came in our day experience Lord for father we receive william branham in the name of a prophet therefore we shall receive his reward we shall come into his experience father as a wave sheaf that was waved over us as a redeemed life that came to maturity through the grace of God through the power of the blood that everything that Adam lost came back into his possession Lord and father Lord we will he lived out an example that life that could be expressed that would unfold the word that would bring forth eternity on the earth in the earth for the glory of God I pray father that tonight Lord there would be a manifestation of this life the life of Melchizedek let this Melchizedek be expressed in the name of Jesus o God and that your anointing would come upon each one that Lord our thoughts would be only on you Lord that we would consciously now consciously lay aside everything everything all criticisms all inhibitions all cultural limitations all ideologies all national spirits all memories and all things and have your perfect love and commune with you let the expectation and the faith rise up in the name of Jesus Christ father to go beyond anything that we've ever seen or experienced in our lives for father here in this room as the ingredients for the greatest experience that we could ever have in our lives because Jehovah our Jesus the life of God is in this place and I pray Lord Jesus that our expectation you would exceed it tonight have your way Lord move in this place father we humble ourselves under your mighty hand and Jesus Christ name Amen hallelujah and lelou god bless you Saints Amen it is a wonderful privilege to be in the house of the Lord thank you musicians amen well it's so nice to have the skeleton crew hallelujah looks like christmas has come early and amen but well you know what the main thing is that we're two or three together together well the Lord has come to fellowship amen and I I might mention this almost all the time but you can bear with me but the Lord said that I'll rejoice with you in my spirit don't forget that it's not just a one-way thing it's not just a one-way relationship it's not just us always rejoicing and looking up and worshiping but God is rejoicing with us amen hallelujah I won't keep you standing I think I can turn on here I want to continue on from the series now while we call it a series but just the second part of when the valleys and mountains meet and perfect love and the actual subject is a climate of love and amen there is a background behind love and what it brings and actually we know that the Lord is love and he is revealing himself and the epitome of his love and this in time as the capstone Amen so in homer's all things that we have need of amen and the pillar of fire with all the things that Moses needed for the journey and all things that we would need for the journey amen no matter how dark it gets that pillar of fire will lead us amen hallelujah so let's turn in our Bibles our sorry you have to turn them oh I don't have any scriptures on this but we will just read from Isaiah chapter 40 and we'll read verses 3 to 5 amen and I wanted to clear something right now now listen very carefully to this and I know that you already know this but I just have to say it anyway you know how the Lord just has he's quite the Lord is a symbolic person he's he he likes to do things that mean something symbolically amen the climate of love is here amen hallelujah I like to say that because that's a powerful thing the climate of love is here the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord and make straight in the desert a highway for our God oh my I'm so glad that there is a highway that's been made you know man I'm gonna start I'll just keep going hold on every Valley shall be exalted and every mountain and Hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it may the Lord add is blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I'm so glad that Elisha has come I'm so thankful because you see now we find that this week if we read this from a historical perspective here we see that this prophecy was was was to describe John the Baptist ministry it was to describe the dynamics and the the intention that God had to sin John the Baptist to clear everything out and just create a climate where the people that was following the past and the things that God had done and he had been placed back into a historical condition to bring it forward to turn the hearts of the people and clear all that and make a highway amen we were talking about highways in South Africa last night and how in New Zealand is only a one lane highway most of the way and it's one lane that way in one lane that way right and you know you get you get a tractor you get something and you just stuck man and you can be stuck for a long time and if and and if you're in a believer's car you can't pass that truck very often because believers don't have fast cars is that right there we all have sanctified cars a big wagons yeah amen and so there's always going to be these obstacles on the highway you know on a little highway but you see when God came he didn't just create a one lane highway for our God but he created a double way seven main highway amen hallelujah for a divine seven seal connection amen traveling at the Skookum in the speed of light anyone tell me what's faster than the speed of light can anyone tell me what's faster than the speed of light Rebecca Wow amen we'll just say of course he is fought fought as faster than the speed of light amen and that's why once we get into our glorified condition back to where we should have been before Adam fell we will travel by thought hallelujah you know if you are light now there's a physicist in here I don't know if you learned that some sort of I won't i won't i won't frame him but let's just say that if you are light and you are traveling at that speed there is no such thing as space because you see when you're traveling at the speed of light and if you are light itself there is no space so you can you just are light does not see space or time Amen because Jesus says I am the light of the world and therefore I am that I am and before Abraham was I am Amen because he travels at the speed of light he is the light and he is an all time does not exist in his eyes even though he created he's not subject to it amen so we have a highway that's been made for our God there's a purpose that this Ministry of Elijah would come and to tie everything that was there that the intention of John the Baptist ministry was to that to tie it and win in 1930-something 33 or 6 or 5 I don't know exactly what year it was but when brother Branham was baptizing the 17th person on the high river a voice the pillar of fire comes down and was seen by many any and and and and it said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of jesus christ I seen you with a message to foreign the second coming of Jesus Christ and so you see that the very the the very intent the very that the grace that was issued forth that was dispensed through the ministry would be dispensed through the Ministry of our Elijah and and what he would do as mate bring us to a climate where everything that has been promised everything that was been lost and everything that is inhibiting us that is stopping us that is restricting us and all the faults and all the barriers and officer and all the society's expectations and all the pressures and all of the the isms and ideologies and fears and all of these things that Satan has built up over the last hundreds of years would be broken down there would come a liberation and and anybody that's listening in this room right now can be free whatever is troubling you whatever is inhibiting you and the devil may be screaming in your mind right now don't listen to him listen to him you have your own life you do it your way you've got a better idea you know that Satan said that before the world ever began he thought he had a better idea he thought he could do a better thing than Michael he thought he could do a better society and he he had a pretty well ingenious idea but you see there is a way that seemeth right unto men but the end thereof is death and no matter how the devil can reason to you how good it may seem how good it may seem look at what Satan has created out here look at the civilization that is you see he's made this great thing and the Prophet said it's a Satan's Eden and it's a great world to sinan and he's made it and this he's not trying to as Isaac said last Sunday he doesn't want you to have a miserable life he wants you to enjoy this he wants it to work this is his best effort and look at it that's full of emptiness darkness fail I couldn't if I was if I was the teacher of all teachers and I'm and I got his assignment I would put if on me amen they gotta fail he failed his exam and all those angels that followed him and went down with them fail and they know it and that's why they're so mad that's why they're beating at the gate they want it they just want to be free to gone cause carnage and one day when when the bride leaves and the Holy Ghost lifts off but you the world has never seen anything so bad right now he's on a leash right now it's limited what he can do he's has to abide by things because the brides here and because God has to not finish yet but when this lives off all of that how all that hatred because he knows he's got an end he knows that he will one day cease to exist he knows that he and he knows that an e that must just completely great him and he knows he can't be redeemed and that's why he's doing everything he can to take you he wants to take you he wants to destroy you once he's finished with you he'll use you in many different ways if he can but God Richard mercy he sent us a message in this day and without this message oh my you would be swimming in darkness with you won't know that when from the trees I'm telling you this world is groping and darkness groping and darkness you know that song that the Lord gave us ages ago for the youth camp and it says everywhere I looked darkness was my light not anymore Amen but dark everywhere no matter if someone outside no matter who they are whether they are the most sincere Christian and they out they even have a spiritual experience with the law without this message everywhere they look as darkness they just have little bits of pockets of light that they see but they don't see what we see and it's God and simplicity it's God so simple so humble yet so powerful hallelujah let me just read here you know there's a quote that we're brother Brandon sees one day will realize realization has anyone ever heard that before that just you know my hallelujah the prophets the Apostles they all speak of a time where the people the redeemed will come to a fullness they'll come to that spot where the Lord just raptures them off the earth and says here in 1 Corinthians 2 verse 9 and 10 it says but at it as it is written eye has not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love them but here's now we always put this off to the Future right yes there will be a full measure of it that we cannot even our hearts cannot even conceive but do not put your experience off into the future because the very god hallelujah the very mighty conqueror the second Adam has come down into your Jerusalem and he's come down into a war-torn religious miss Hart that's full of all sorts of cancerous color or all sorts of parasites all sorts of ideologies and craziness and he comes down and he says I'm going to turn that back into a need in at condition again I'm gonna give you peace I'm gonna bring it all back to the way it should be amen so if that God promised to do that inside you shouldn't you just say Here I am Lord who says that as if I come to that place where you realize that the very creator the creator of heavens and earth has promised to turn your heart which has been war-torn back into Jerusalem back into an eternity condition and all you can do you go Lord Here I am Here I am Lord I'm and you know you see now because I want I don't just want to bring a whole bunch of facts to you but I want to show you prophetically or where we are right now because you see when you know where you are right now you can take positive advantage of the grace that is being poured out in the moment that you're living in because the Lord does specific things when the cloud stopped they he he revealed a few things to the people and he gave Commandments with us in there and then he moved on and then he did some more specific things and then he stopped and then he moved on and he revealed more so if we're walking with the pillar of fire then daily monthly yearly as a local version as local bride as the bride international because you see what's being ministered in the spirit that's very similar all over because it's the same spirit inspiring and yet the balance of the ministry will sway like this depending on what spirits are taking the church ma so that's why it's so important that you engaged in the local ministry that there's been given to you amen it's very important because the Lord is keeping the balance but yet the subjects the the climate the very divine expression it's very similar what he's doing we are in a climate of love hallelujah I just read I read a scripture to you that you all know very well we all know that scripture I have not seen nor has he heard everyone knows the scripture right it's a favorite it's it's a scripture that we can all say wow this is so amazing but sometimes we forget to read the next verse and the next verse is this but God I like it when it sees about God who likes it when it sees about God oh my oh my my we can just really go there has revealed them what what is he revealed the things that God has prepared for them that love him these great things right but God has revealed them unto us by a spirit so you see as as the word goes forth little by little God just starts to reveal to you these things now when when you can get caught up in the very thought of it did you know that the fort of the word you know anyone can just say a bunch of words you know anyone can just preach a bunch of words but anyone can read the Bible but what's the thought behind it what's the emotion behind it what does God feel about this word what is the very essence the heart of the matter and now as you see a minister can get caught up in their rule and there's people you can tell you can tell how impacted some people were getting when a certain word goes forth and it strikes their minutes in season and they say how good is it oh my and this is enough is it that the heart of God is expressed and that person gets caught up in the moment and it can be the most simple thing and yet there's like that predestined seed inside you it just just just stirs up and it reaches out and the leaves come open and the light and the rain causes life to come forth so you see this future home this heavenly home we are hearing front we are hearing from our theophanies we are hearing from our heavenly home we are hearing from our new jerusalem hallelujah like a city coming down hallelujah amen hallelujah there's more to preaching them sometimes we realize and if you can just sit there and say wherever you're at if you can sit there and just say lord help me to believe that just these are warfare going on right now there's a warfare happening right now in this place right here and the devil does not want you to be impacted by the word he wants to keep you on a he wants you to learn he doesn't mind you learning the word learning all the mysteries learning all about the message learning at what's happening learning that we're in a climate of love but he doesn't want you to experience the climate of love but you can experience the climate of love open your heart right now and just say Lord let me experience the climate of love because in that climate of love there is no fear and when there's no fear there is faith and you can believe all the word and you have a snowball glory effect can I explain the snowball glory effect you start rolling Amen you start rolling and it just gets better and better and better because you're in the cycle of eternity it's an eternal cycle but you gotta break out of this cultural limitations gotta break out of all of the ideas in your head gotta break out of the lies that Satan's telling you right now that you can't believe it because you don't have faith you have faced every man is given a measure of faith every man all of you has a measure because you are a son or daughter of God default don't even limit yourself hallelujah the devil's very busy always trying to make you feel like you don't believe in you can't believe you here I have faith because you've seen too much of this and then what it's all rubbish it's just a liar let faith rise in your heart believe the word and experience the climate of love back rounding so this line here when the mountains and valleys join in perfect love you know when the ballot mallet when the mountains and valleys join it creates a plane right it creates an area where the devil cannot hide for those that you weren't here last time I like it when the devil can hide and he just gets guns on him and he gets punched and he gets kick hallelujah he gets a beating until he leaves the leaves all hallelujah amen put yourself on the operating table and let him meet God just let God bring your life up to a point now he brings the local church up to that right he removes criticisms he removes all of these spirits that would cause pride and inferiorities and and and people down in the dumps and the deepest valleys within it where it's just so bad these depressions and all of these things this is what the devil wants but the Lord seem to like the Lord sent us a message hallelujah sent us a message now in that message is power hallelujah to raise the valley floor to take down all the pride and take down the big man the big names all of that stuff means nothing hallelujah and to remove all the fanaticism on the top tip of the mountain and take away all the legalism at the bottom of the valley and bring it into a place where it's any dinner conditions flat why because there has to be a battle of Armageddon in your life hallelujah he wants to do that for you he wants to make it plain the ego children I gave you contextual pictures [Laughter] he wants to make your life like that you see now he's doing it for our church here I can't speak for other churches I'm not part of them but I'm sure he's doing anything here but he's bringing the local vision into a place where the devil cannot heavy nice way hallelujah and you're so glad and you're so glad Laurie because his day is finished now because the bride can discern the Antichrist spirit now why because someone got given a sword in their hand hallelujah we have a prophet amen the first redeemed son to come to maturity whoa and he received a plummet in his hand Amen do you know what a plummet is who knows what a plummet is hallelujah Amen let's go that's a plummet this is old-school now we don't use these anymore we use lasers amen so you can think if you want to anyone know the Sermon the countdown with the Prophet types technology worth with the advancement of the bride's experience and what as the Lord gives revelation to the bride and and unlocks the mysteries of his will and gives her the power to become body and then if she starts to advance in the word and become more like him then the technology also follow suit now so so you can see this plummet that has what they do with this plummet as as it helps them to make it straight and true and square and they and they use them in the old days now we have lasers right amen so here is this plummet and it's been placed in the hands of a prophet hallelujah what that plummet is is the sword of the king amen finally after 2,000 years of of all sorts of listen bad and maybe this and maybe there and all of those things and questions all over and the accuser of the Brethren could not fully be cast down he was still accusing see they believe that you're a three-person Trinity they believe in this bunny baptism I managed to put into their midst to take away the power of the name of Jesus but and then all of a sudden he was silenced hallelujah all of a sudden I plummet landed in the hands of the Prophet amen what to do to to kick the devil out of your experience to give her out of your life this message has come to completely remove Satan out of your life completely remove all ideologies all all national spirits why because a sort landed in a prophet an amen Noah lujah I'll go back to that later so you see here comes us now I'm not I don't you know the foundation of this and the mechanics you know as Zod right the correct order and doctrine and all those things but it's far higher than it it's grown far greater that's just the foundation it's just the building blocks you know the ABCs here's the ABCs how you should carry yourself you see if that's just on the outside and it's just been lived out because you see that it's the right thing to do and then their very heart of God's love and grace has not pitched it inside yet but there is a power in this room there's a Holy Ghost for you there's a Holy Ghost for you right now in this place that can take and itch the very heart and character a nature of God inside you and to your heart right the law on the fleshy tables of your heart so this word would go forth and there would be now at for the last 50 years since the book came open and and the fullness of the word has been manifested you know this word has been going false but there's been so much limitations so much of the man age still and the people so much of the man age still in the ministry the ministry preaches doctrine in the Eagle age but administers the message in the man age many times many times the administration of the message to what the leadership has just been a repeat of how they were raised in their churches how they were raised by their parents and then it gets enforced on the people by a law and by a hard mentality because that's how it used to be done that's how it wasn't the manager there's how it wasn't the Victorian age but this higher way you see love creates an atmosphere with sovereign grace can manifest in its full measure and so love as a person who comes down now you can't come down when the atmosphere is wrong conception can't take place and critical conditions conception cannot take place with someone is so pressured to perform Oh Lord make meanness oh I just got to do this and they try and they try like a couple that's longed to have children and maybe they do yes a few years they want to establish their life this is just hypothetical not talking about anyone in particular but they want to establish their life so they spend five years and they build their life and they get their home and then they try and get two babies right have a baby and maybe they try for a year and then all of a sudden fear comes all of a sudden is they're worried all of a sudden they get tense all of a sudden love can not the climate of love gets overtaken by fear overtaken by pressure overtaken by and it becomes a the Prophet said if you want to conceive you just need to go and adopt a baby right and then just relax and then when you relax many times that people can have babies because they've relaxed again they've fell in love with this baby that they adopted and then and then they can have babies again now that now they've relaxed now there's a climate of love and this is the climate that we're in now amen and so the administration the way it is administered the wires expressed the way that it is led has to follow the climate of love and perfect balance to allow the Spirit of God to conceive in the people's hearts so the people can take their critical stickers that are poking that people are looking everywhere and critical and turn them back into live so that that person can actually get born again that person can actually have love in their life that person can become gracious because now these leaves because the leaf that stuck up and others by cannot photosynthesize but when it rolls out and the water comes down and the sunshine or my great things can happen there is the climate that we are in so God has revealed these things to us he is revealing he is giving you a glimpse of your heavenly home hey man hallelujah the rapture is a cycle what's happening now we're in it if you're not in it get in it now there is no excuse there is no reason to not be in this rapture for you personally now it's time this is your hour this is your moment to come into a climate of love because you're made for it this is what you're made for we're made for this we're made this is the very heart of God that he's been waiting for he's been waiting for this time for many years this is like one of the delights of God's heart that's happening right now and you happen to be part of it you have to be part of the greatest love story as its manifesting in the flesh hallelujah you know all that he's desired and all the types and everything that all these thousands of lives all the stars all the chromosomes and all of the everything has all as all pointing towards the very experience that you have been privileged and you want to hold back here's a divine expression of love now when you receive that expression when all of the glass has cleared away because of the largest ministry when all the mountains and valleys in your life have been made plain and the devil's exposed and he can't find a place to hide in you then you become a reflector and you and it goes he shines and he expresses now the reflector don't think of it as a mirror think of it as a divine attribute because you see the divine attribute in your life when the word comes and it's full pal which are does happening right now the divine attribute justice it comes back and it meets and it twists together double helix like like the DNA strand it comes together and that that that that's that's really like coming into communion with the Lord because your your predestined seed and has divine expression is it's becoming married it's becoming unified on those tapes now I'm just gonna this just this is mechanical now those tapes now have power and them to bring you to that condition don't limit what's happened what can happen on those tapes if you're you might be in a critical condition right now spiritually and you're struggling let me share a testimony I went out when I ran away from the Lord I ran away from the Lord for about a year 12 years ago and I got so caught up in everything that the world could evil all that stuff right and I got so spiritually drained out I could not live a life of a Christian right I couldn't even think of calling on the name of the Lord it was just like man how could I do I knew it was wrong I knew it was right to do that and I knew that what he could do but I just couldn't do it because I was so spiritually in it and weak yeah and so you know what the Lord reminded me of this this this remember the the Chiefs that talked to brother Branham and brother Branham interviewed the chief and brother Brennan says house chief going and chief says chief is going good and he goes but but then the chief says but it depends on which dog the chief feeds the most because if he feeds that a few feet the black dog you're gonna get weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker and the white dog you know the white dog inside you their God part it just becomes just it's becomes dormant and their flesh you struggle with thoughts and all that because you've gone beyond the barrier of the word you've gone out of the protection of God and you're out there on your own on your own in a wilderness and your free game and this prayers come and to hide you and protect you and how the Saints are pray to keep you know if you only knew know for me I was in that placement I ended up like the prodigal son rejected from darkness my I got down to the lowest place you could ever get apart from not as low as how the Lord went because he was the one that came to homeless the greatest became them the lowest think of that the greatest became the last when I got close to that rock rock bottom beyond below rock bottom rejected from society rejected and then the Lord spoke if you feed the white dog you'll get strength again so I started playing the message I had the message so I just played the tapes now at first I couldn't even listen to it I had to play it below audible you know I happen things started changing hallelujah I experienced isaiah 43:2 5 my life stud a highway started being formed the mountains started coming down the valley started coming up amen the pile started becoming straight hallelujah I did nothing like a right hallelujah she had a message too she had a mighty angel as well he came down with a sword too we hid my mother an open book come down stand on the sea in the earth she had one that came down on the land to take the people into there she didn't do nothing other than believe and she stood she stood there under the world hallelujah the captain released the mystery that would redeem her the captain released the mystery and there was a praying people a vision based people who took the measure got there by the angel and acted upon it don't just hear what I'm saying do it I just think it's good to listen to tapes listen to them cuz that's the voice of the mighty angel it's the voice that I kept if you mix it with faith that's just the voice of a Kentuckian if you just listen to it intellectually you can learn all the Kentucky and was privileged to speak and this as far as but if you've got faith if you're believing a man that's the voice of the mighty angel that's the voice behind the voice amen Rahab stood there and he come the grace just crumbled her whole past everything started what did he do took all the man-made structure out all of the lies all of the haters all of those that were against all of her accusers was destroyed amen she didn't go there and smash the wall she just listened to the tapes however yeah she listened and she became subject to the anointing of the mighty angel the anointing of the captain who would come down into her life so that she would be fit to marry the captain of the army whoa hey men friend I tell you she did nothing to deserve it and nothing to make it happen apart from act upon the word that she believed she just acted upon it she looked out a prophecy of you hey man it's not how much you can perform and all these things it's believed and what stand still stand still and see the salvation of God so I listen to these tapes and all of these things the white dog started getting stronger and stronger and stronger the volume started getting higher and higher and higher and I started to enjoy it then one day one day hallelujah when the when the path the construction site was getting to a certain point now where you could start to see the appearing of the building came in and in things are starting to take shape I didn't do anything else to do like Rahab hallelujah listening believing knowing I was in a critical condition and you may be in a critical condition and YouTube is so tantalizing and all of these evils it's so hard to stop but tonight I can just encourage you put a tape on just put the voice on and say Lord I want to feed the white dog now I can tell you now more than a month things will start changing man I will make a highway for our God and we're gonna within a few months you there will be a highway in your life and your engagement with the Lord and your relationship with the Lord will be a climate of love a climate of love where you can conceive where you can have peace where you can have joy where you can respond to this word appropriately without any areas I ever gonna get to my fall here and reject the king the Prophet sees this that I finished that thought I did a I'll just see it one more thing I just was reminded I have to share this because so you know when it got to a certain point now now I have now I now I you know this was like a process here because you know you don't realize how bad it was how far I'd gone real far and I'm not going to go into the details I want to glorify the devil but and now you know instead of like evil satanic music playing in my ears all night I hit the message plain can you think that right this is a contrast now that black dog was not happy and there was a Bible sitting in my dresser in my bedside table and that Bible dare I say it was covered in dust dust hadn't touched it but I used to look at it you know I knew I should be reading them I should be reading that and there might be some dusty Bibles in here tonight hey man just put one foot in front of the other just one verse even the Lord just wants something to work with give them something to work with and I just felt like I should read this thing I'm gonna read it so I picked it up and I just open what's happening here I picked this Bible up and I and I opened the Bible and you know what open to it open to this is the Lord it opened to touch not the unclean thing and I will receive do you know how powerful that was for me because I was still dabbling it I was still dabbling I was still doing things that I shouldn't be doing taking things I shouldn't take and I had I had written an exegesis of Revelation beforehand so you can see I was already I was well on my way to walking as a Christian but I was well on my way to becoming a critical dogmatic unbelieving believer but I had to go down to the bottom of the bottom and realize that I'm nothing hallelujah so that God could pick up the broken pieces and he says that's not the unclean thing and I will receive you and this revelation came to me I've tried I've received the Lord year ago I was on fire I was going around the prisons and I was telling everyone in there I was fighting all the Jehovah Witnesses fighting the Catholics fighting the Mormons telling them how wrong they were because I had the message the message of the hour and I'm not putting that down because this is the greatest thing for us but I had the wrong attitude motive because I received do you know why I hadn't been received there was one reason why I hadn't been received because I reserved 1% of my agenda just 1% now I'm not a mathematician but let's just say 1% cause it sounds dramatic I reserved 1% I reserved something I don't know what pasina's but I reserved something it was one thing I held on to and it was my life you know it's very subtle right it's very subtle the Lord knows when you lose your reservation he knows when you just say it's like you're all tense and you're about to go through the sound barrier let's shake it and all of a sudden you let go of that 1% good and you're smooth you've broken through there's a glory that never fails in this place you're in the Shekinah you were a stick shaped by man use for tax rate on everybody you turn back into your origin why who broke through why cuz let go of that elem forfeits their rights all of them and I held on to one thing and there was a moment in the end I was reading the scripture as he touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and I said lord I don't want to be received I want this and I knew I hadn't been received you know I heard the prophets say it's one thing for us to believe in God and it's another thing for him to come and see us to receive her faith and I thought oh Jesus oh my it was about two weeks after that where that one person little piece of sand was given over and you know what he did let me just share something with you he took that send Amen they elect piece of sand like he said to Abraham look at the sand of the stars and he took this and he placed it in the heavens hallelujah from this sand to the Stars amen so the devil could stop using me to build his society and then take the sand that they used to build and build a great Babylon place me back to build the New Jerusalem that's what he wants to build out of your life he doesn't want you to build now there's nothing wrong with working nothing wrong you have to do it one day you won't be able to make the most of it now but one day when you get lose that privilege what will happen you'll speak and all of the and there will be a need for for for salvation over there it will be one and he is a name speak your way hallelujah speak the outcome of that person speak and the waters will clear the devil will rage the storm over here speak and the storm will disappear Alleluia raise that sons and daughters raise up sons and daughters of God let go of yourself let go of your inhibitions let go of your education now I'm not saying that you shouldn't educate or whatever we want to be balanced here but let go of it and let God use it we can't use it don't you use a stop using it all yourself God you'll be surprised what he lets you have you'll be surprised that most of the stuff that you hold on to you'll keep he just wants you to give it to him he wants you to fulfill it hallelujah and I did two weeks later and I got the Holy Ghost two weeks later I just note that on the end of my beard and I said Lord Here I am I'm ready for reception lord I just give everything to you take this world out of me take the desire for this world take all of the drugs and all the alcohol and all the addictions and I was addicted to them all all of it take it all away take the need for all these friends that I had take it all away and I had a supernatural experience in my room and I went from being a alcoholic drug addict social addict out all the time partying needing all these things to completely free completely free totally delivered hallelujah totally because I let go even if it's 0.0001 if you're conscious of it now here's the balance there's a lot of things that you have no idea that you got when you first do that he's not worried about those he's not worried about you having this big memory challenge to remember everything it's not that all the information I've got a repeater versus repeater there no it's one simple surrender you knows the moment that you just let go he knows it and everything changes everything changed when he came amen bye-bye the Prophet sees us and the rejected King and I heard a voice then that spake unto me now he's up in heaven right he's he's having his heavenly experience right now who knows the Prophet got taken up into heaven does everyone know that right you know the story oh that's very impacting so he's up there and this is and I heard a voice then let spoke to me that was in the room so this is the Lord you know the angel of the Lord that was with him said this is what you preached when I heard that I thought of glory I'm so glad that that great presence and that great atmosphere and the thing that he couldn't even have human words to describe was the very thing that he preached I thought wow this could come out of a prophets math this creative power this glory this atmosphere so if I could listen to these tapes I could experience a climate of love I could experience I could experience that and I really can you really experience that yes but these things that Barkat in your life is mental barriers these depressions there's false message cultures there's pressures there's tensions there's depressions there's evil spirits that you will Helen because of music and because of anger and the devil knows our weaknesses and he uses them and it brings you to church and you follow these things and troubles and woes and by the time you leave you're just back to zero like he wants you to come in here zero or here oh he wants you to come and go further he doesn't want you just to get recalibrated back to normal again amen you are made to live above those things you're made to live in your privilege you are made to live above the devil and all his antics and if you want the climate of love that is being ministered to fully affect your life take out of your heart and set your heart upon by God set your heart upon by God now we hear that a lot right he the Lord says that in almost every interpretation in the message sit by heart upon me and commit all my ways to me and guard your heart you are responsible o men for though for what you allow into your heart for what you allow into your life what you are Alan to your families and the things that art of the Lord are there to rep the experience of God out of your family out of your life out of your home cuz filled with the tree of knowledge and filled all the busyness he wants you to build Babylon but God wants to build a new Jerusalem out of here I want you to build he says sit your affections on things above not on things that are safe you know I was just reading this article they say that you know when you learn something at the start you're thinking about it you're wondering how you got to think about every process of a skill but in one day after you've done it so much it becomes autonomous right and the older you get the longer it takes children can pick up at a complex skill within days hours because their mind is geared and wired differently but an adult this subconscious takes a long time but they've found in studies that if someone has a passion for something hard if you've got a passion for something it gets ingrained inside you real quick so it's time to get a passion about this message it's time to be passionate about the law hallelujah but if your affections are sitting on other things and you're passionate about those then when you hear preaching yes it's good and you agree and it's all right and you get a little bit out of a service you get one take home fort and okay and you look at those others and they're like I know what's happening why aren't why am I not like where's your affection where's your passion because somehow the Lord's designed us that when your passion isn't something and you're passionate about it it's like an open highway for the Lord to turn your heart back to the message of the Apostles which is the person of Jesus Christ which is perfect love which is the very angel that comes down hallelujah an open book and he says come and eat it do you want some sustenance I'll give you sustenance they write real sustenance amen thanks give milk it opens when you really passionate about something it's like it opens all the channels and in whatever you're listening to or enjoying or about and oh my you can learn that real quick let's open something to you what do you open what do you want me to the Lord says take out of your heart take care of your heart oh man set your heart upon your God Who am I so this is the hour this is the hour where it all is being manifested this is the our way to find love as being manifested where the capstone is descending and attention is getting drawn to all these things you know I'm thinking of that brother that sees all brother branham is he gonna be pig hunting and heaven oh and he says brother I don't even know what he said I can't remember but mate he said there is no if you could only imagine he says if I think he says can you imagine being a pig in a pig pen all your life and all of a sudden you get then you become a man and you remember what it was like to be a pig would you even want to go back would you ever want to go back to that oh my this is no time to buy a million oh and you'll get it and you'll get a taste of your future what it's gonna be the things that we'll have will give us joy go beyond anything we could ever imagine any but just think of this be passionate know about this message and if you're not us say Lord what is stopping me from being passionate about this marriage what is stopping me from raising out of my seat when I hear the word what is stopping you what are you thinking about if the word which is you just think that if there's a highway there and the Lord is speaking and there's and there's the highway you can pass all the trucks a man it's a seven lane highway amen and you can just there's no inhibitions you see something you just go straight past it Amen the devil stops over the attend a charity edit edit edit edit edit edit yeah you just go see you later I'm going see you later Dibble don't even stop to entertain him hallelujah you know you get delivered from lust or you get delivered from some spirit or something you get victory do you think that Devils gonna leave you alone he gonna try and bring you back and he stay he's been kicked off he's on the side of that highway hallelujah and he's been kicked off and he's tenets entering trying to bring you back into that again because he knows that if your passions get turned towards naked woman or man or whatever it'll just destroy your experience in the word I'm so glad for the blood I'm so glad cuz you know we do sometimes fall for those little things that we've already been delivered from already but not victory over sometimes we fall but these are blood there's a blood that keeps us in fellowship keeps us on speaking terms keeps us hallelujah oh my for all sins past all sins prison in Olsen's future hallelujah the power of the blood and under the revelation of the fullness of the word as the capstone of love descends down he's like the king and Esther's ooh when Esther was up there Haman was trying to slimy accusations and tricks and the King's wrath came upon the enemy and got him behind on his own gallows that's exactly what happens to Satan with all of your mistakes all your problems all your struggles all your failures come on his head and he's hanging off at all he's hung with all of those things that's the perilous message you know I mean let me find this Oh Mike honey put the Lord brings out all the valleys and everything and makes your life a plain so that he can get rid of the enemy he doesn't forgive the devil anywhere to hide so what does he do he brings him in on earth he's bringing heaven on earth to you now I don't mean out there I'm talking about in here hey man he's bringing heaven in here and if he brings heaven in here then he brings heaven on here and it's heaven walking here's heaven hello heaven in heaven is everywhere because you're walking hallelujah all the valleys are raised all the mountains and perfect love creates a perfect seventh seal seventh dimension experience and this message has come to minister an entrance into that Kingdom it says that an entrance shall be ministered unto you into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ minister now I encourage you go home and pray and say Lord I want to be under the full effect of it I want to be impacted by it I want to realize realization I want to know about to experience or to feel and I wants to see it I want it to be all over me and it's keeping me alive and I don't just want all over me I want by oh shut up in rebel hallelujah I'm about to close well I got two quotes down how am I you know you just yield to the Lord and let him speak we have all of our own ideas and sometimes you get so nervous and you just lay it all and say Lord you know he the Lord I believe that every service the Lord has a burden burden on his heart he wants to speak to his bride and so he just someone can just yield he's able to speak are you with me on that that thought there's an expression but this that but we have to be we've got to realize are we the Prophet asked this question and the church age books are we sufficiently impressed by the message and emerged and we sufficiently impressed not just how we impressed because we are impressed right it's impressive the Lord is impressive we we stay here we're enjoying that right but as it's sufficient is there anything that is limiting is there anything that is limiting our impression because you see you take the image of a signet right and here's a firebrand and that's the image of that life of God and it's not just a it's not just a affect or that's it's an inelastic life so that's the power of an in this life the prophecy when they hold the window when the pillar of fire came and he said it was like it was just a formative powerful the very creator that breathed all the stars here he is in a form of a pillar of fire now that life is being expressed that life is being ministered are we sufficiently impressed bicep is it I believe that as we grow and as all the valleys and the mountains and all the and here we are there's no crookedness and the path between us and our God there's no one lane highways you know sometimes you know some people give their experience of God is a gravel windy road cliff on one side and they're right next to the edge of the cliff there's some people's experience and then on the other end you've got some people that they're just so full of God and they're so just full of God and you'd love to be around them and they're just so nice and in kind and and imbalanced and and they always have something to say that's good but they don't just yell it all out it's just the life of God they got a seven lane highway they've come under the full effect of this message because when they heard it they let 1% of grain give you all of my emissions I give you all of my hobbies I give you all of my likes all of my dislikes I'll give you everything everything and all of a sudden you can't get enough of a message you're like John and you're in the book of Revelation chapter 10 verse 8 and I said I heard a voice which speakers from him just go and take the book out of the seventh angels hand no not out of the seven angels hand he's a critic is a key here out of the hand of him that stands upon the CNF on the earth you are called to eat from the Lord's hand now the Lord spoke that Thrones vindicated prophet but you are to go beyond the vessels beyond the flesh amen when I look at that pillar of fire video photo down the back there when I see that I'm not just looking at a Kentucky and I'm looking at my god I'm looking at the pillar of fire the Prophet just happened to be privileged to get his photo taken the pillar of fire but that photo is the pillar of fire amen where is that photo here I like that this is my my my lord here in a perform of a pillar of fire the same one that led the children of Israel and the Prophet just heaven no no you happened to get privileged enough for the Lord to benefit himself in this dimension and a camera took it all right how do I black this off here we go we are called to go beyond the flesh we're called to take the book from the hands of him that stands upon the CN upon the earth a man prophesies this and I heard a voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it he also says this and whatever he says to you do it I like the title of it he says now perfect faith just like perfect love casts out all fear all doubting if you believe it no matter what the symptoms are what the results you believe it just the same so there's a perfect connection under Elijah's ministry must be manifest to allow total deliverance and restoration that is why all of the paths and all of us has made like the plain of megiddo ready for the Battle of Armageddon that's going to see you filled with the Holy Ghost it's got to see you come across into your inheritance it's going to see you in a condition where the the devil has no way around and you are completely free and anytime the devil comes you see him a mile away can't hide cuz there's no help there's no mountains firm to hide behind oh man do you catch that you see that it's powerful that's amazing this is the climate we're in one day I was praying and we were burdened for things that was happening and people that were struggling and you know people will talk to you about stuff and you feel burdened for them until you pray you say Lord this is this is a lot this is like fire this is just so much so we're praying and then and then and and I'm praying and then and then this you know it was like I don't know how to describe it but all of a sudden the atmosphere changing I could see it and a bit more of a perspective like God could see it and and it was like it just dawned the season that we're own as a season where the mountains and the valleys are coming together and there's a climate of perfect love and all of your trials the final things that are hiding in your life are going to be delivered and the reason is is because we're all coming back to our first love and in this love environment the fear of rejection the fear of being criticized as disappears in love and so you feel open to be able to share these things with us and them and the pastor especially who's called to cancel and speed of the Lord so that gift could operate and the people actually come to an experience when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time and he said no son could be there and he said I could just there was it was just such a perfect love and here's perfect love descending down into this dimension upon the church to bring us into a climate where you can trust your pastor where you can open up and receive counsel on the most embarrassing things that you could ever imagine that you never thought you'd ever see of anyone and if you hold on to those things you'll never get delivered of it and the Lord needs a climate where the mountains come down and the valleys come up so that you can have your trials the valley trials and a climate of love instead of just being down in the dumps gone through these things is happening and your your your maintaining an environment where you feel like you can trust people now and this is Edenic condition forming because here is an Eden here's a needy anat condition he's a needy Annette condition he's a needy Anat condition he's an idiot condition here's a needy enik condition all through and of a sudden here's an environment where Eden is almost manifesting on the earth and all of a sudden the people ain't got nowhere to hide all of a sudden she becomes an invincible army because the devil got nowhere to hide you know this is and so the Lord kind of showed me that and I was like well when I start telling Bob and all about it it was very late and I pray too long and honey was sleeping I didn't realize you're sleeping though well I I just I was talking for about 15 minutes telling her I was like so excited and I said you know I was I didn't give her a chance to respond and I thought she was listening because we were praying you know like we were like this and she's got on it I thought oh well I'm gonna write this down this so and then I started writing it and then this is what came so this is what this is so it's like kind of supernaturally like just show us where we're at we are here that's not somewhere to come we are here now that you know the grace that is here in this love all the fear and all the inhibitions the station has built up and now I'm gonna say one more thing can I hit five more minutes said all right I promise hmm okay so can you everyone see that I'm not gonna go right into it but this is don't worry about the top okay let's just look at the bottom you have Abraham in the promised land receiving the promise - he owns it all as far as the eye could see right as far as the eye could see you own it all Abraham take it that's all yours but did Abraham actually get access to it it was all hers he could have taken it you know he had the anointing but was it the season you know when when all of the kings took lot and what he expressed that there was power to take it cuz he just would talk people with farm plows and shares and go took over all the nations he won it all and he was in fellowship with Melchizedek in the land identity was very reality to him he knew at all just like Paul then you have Isaac Jacob and Joseph so these four they had an identity of apostolic land they believe they were free people and Joseph experienced now coming into the Dark Age where they came into slavery right now in slavery for hundred years now here's the key to this and I don't want to go through all this I'm not preaching the sermon so this is the seven Church ages in the Old Testament but I'm not preaching this what I wanted what I want to show you here is Satan God promised this is how cunning than tricky the devil is when Satan was standing Satan was standing there listening to God's tell Abraham your people so show June 400 years right they're gonna go to Egypt they're gonna and then I'm gonna bring them out with a great deliverance so Satan was like oh you're sweet let's see a let's see what I'm gonna say what a say sing go to do Randy go starts working straight away and he builds up all the walls he builds up all the military he takes the tree of knowledge and he builds up all of the inhibitions all of the struggles all of the mentality so he built up the enemy and he I'll tell you how much it is what's the first plate the foot when they got to the land how big was those walls do you think that Satan was not trying to stop them from getting into the land how big was those walls those walls could have chariots running right around them right those people did not think that they are coming in and you know what they couldn't get in there's no way they could penetrate that as a natural people but they weren't just the natural people hallelujah they had a captain amen they have descended mighty angel all my hallelujah with the vision oh my it's not sorry I promised I wouldn't do this so here's satan building up all of the resistance but it doesn't stop there he's done that for us but doesn't stop there he's not just building up the resistance over here in the land again you know he's not just what he he's now working in here so in the dark ages and the dark ages now this is a lot but just just just just believe this that's true and the dark ages here Israel lost their identity 400 years of slavery their mentality became slaves they bought like slaves they lost their identity they forgot what it was like under the Epis taluk age they forgot what it was like to see the great miracles and they but they were true believers but they lost their identity and so we see that when they came across the Red Sea when God finally delivered them 430 years later they came across the Red Sea now the first barrage of resistance coming out was their slave mentality and demon powers God's just brought you out here to kill you you guys are better off in Egypt and they wanted to go back to the slavery have you ever seen anyone want to go back to slavery have you ever seen anyone go back because of the slave mentality well people they just don't want to go forward with the Lord because they just think like slaves they just sit there nothing ever happens in their life cuz they're struggling struggling so here you hit they come across and they're justified by the baptism in the Red Sea and then they come further into the wilderness and the sacrificial system is released and then they and the blood and the sanctification process takes place but still there's a mentality and they fight against it and they say see God had a captain for them waiting all I needed to do was believe the word and across the Jordan if they just went across if they just believed if they just crossed over there was a captain waiting to free Rahab there was a captain waiting they said this is the slave mentality the devil was working it especially our selves a get them because the slave mentality could not receive the grace of God they they they saw God as a slave driver they saw God as someone that wanted them to die in the wilderness even though they'd seen all the miracles because of their speed mentality these are barriers and finally they come here to the River Jordan and then at Kadesh Barnea and finally under Joshua's message they believe that believers Joshua and Caleb and all the younger generation come across and they meet the real captain and now finally now that they've come from vir now that they come here it's going to be a long journey for them and God's going to take the slave mentality out of them and it's the same here let me run through it as quickly we have the seven church ages right here right we have Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira and the church went into the dark ages and they lost their identity that's why and satan built up a society he built up barriers he built up isms he built up ideologies he built up all the civilization to resist you to resist you to keep you down to keep you in the main Age to keep you in an age of civilization building to keep your joy outside of the Lord he did these things he built it all up but not just that he gave you parents that would give you a slave he gave you parents and parents and grandparents and traditions from the dark age that's why you struggle but God Richard mercy sent you a message he sent you a message hallelujah he sent you a Joshua to take you across Jordan to preach your across Jordan but not just to stay there he gave you a captain that you were to marry and so you were like Rahab and you stood there oh yeah and under the word that was released a message would take all the crookedness all of the dark ages all of the inhibitions all of these things you see the stark age of thyatira sardis they didn't have the apostolic version and in philadelphia they didn't have they had a little portion but not enough and even in the Pentecostal time and Laird to see her you know when they pulled out the guest they still saw like men and finally a messenger but was to take the people a William Branham a messenger I like to Republic and Joshua to take the people out of denominationalism to take you to take your parents to take our forefathers to take those who were around come out of denominationalism so he took them out and they started to believe and they preached and they loved it but still is a process and we are we are at the end of that process of where verse mentality has finally started to come out of the people because the people came out at the no Malaysian ISM came out of the man age come out of all the inhibitions all the cultural limitations and all these things so you could come into a climate of love so that you could truly react to the word so that you could truly worship so that the supernatural will manifest in your life and its formation without any inhibitions without any doubts without any frustrations without any fear without any of these cultural disasters that came from the Dark Ages that came from World War one came from World War two and all your fathers and our fathers who are destroyed and their fathers were destroyed in the war their mentalities was broken down and all the society and Satan built it all up but he sent a message to remove it out of you and it's been 50 years and finally let's come to the season let's come to the season now we're no better than our forefathers we're no better than the other be out the old school ministry it's not that anyone that's alive now is going to be a beneficiary and move into it it's a different season this is a season of love this is a season a bonus this is a season of eat any conditions best hallelujah except this flesh this flesh this is a season where you get the mastery if you want mastery over nature if you want the mastery over the earth the earth if you want to walk on the water and then if you want to speak to the trees and move that and move that mountain which you can first you needed get mastery over this and the only thing that's going to do it for you is that mighty angel captain the one that gave them these are the things that you are being delivered from formalism and religious ceremony lack of expectation fear of supernatural fear of change fear of embarrassment fear and general cultural pressures logic slave mentalities and theory or --'tis superiority intellectual basis and education system barriers all the stuff you're being delivered from depressive pressures ideologies and isms those are all the barriers they're all the things that are trying to hold you back they love things that you're struggling with national spirits all stuff it's being taken out of you because you got taken out of that you got translated out of it anyway and now it's getting pulled out of you so that you can manifest the fullness of the word Amen can I have the musicians please hallelujah let's give the Lord some praise amen give them a hand penetrate this is that God this is what he's doing for you this is the message of the hour it's more than just
