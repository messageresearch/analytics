Lord May father you just lay such a powerful platform Lord Jesus for Lord anointed and overcoming breakthrough prayer Lord for tonight Lord we are looking for breakthrough prayer and we believe the one that brings the Breakthrough is here the anointing that brings the Breakthrough is here the power that created the universe that spoke the stars is here in the building to bring breakthrough to bring results to bring change to bring transformation to defeat every devil in every life there is no devil that is powerful enough to withstand the power of God hallelujah and we receive the power of God tonight Lord we surrender to your power tonight we surrender to the force of Heaven because the force of Heaven is greater than the force of Hell the Gates of Hell cannot withstand the revelation of your word and tonight we have faith in the word of God and we believe Lord father that regardless of how deep and how complicated the trials or the over the the storm may be we believe Lord that you're here and father we're believing in your promises to overcome these things father in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah glory amen God is good amen hallelujah isn't he good to us amen thank you musicians we just so grateful who's grateful for the musicians Amen to play Under the inspir operation of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen while you're standing you know we're just going to speak a little bit tonight and just to encourage you before we pray Amen on the violent take the kingdom by force amen and this one's been sitting here for quite a while and it came on the radar so praise the Lord I believe that if you have a need tonight and you want to have something spiritual happen in your life then Paul Paul Have Faith H Allelujah do we have an expectation tonight for the Lord to meet your need personally amen would you invite the Lord to your Pew tonight amen amen invite the Lord to where you're at because he wants to meet your needs amen and so let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew 11: 12-4 and then we'll also go to Luke 10: 17-19 hallelujah amen hallelujah oh praise God Amen Matthew 11:12 to13 and I want you to think about this the heaven comes to break the status quo Hallelujah and Heaven comes with Force Hallelujah and the hell cannot Prevail against it nor can it withstand the force that heaven brings to break the status quo Hallelujah so it says here and from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John and if you will receive it this is Elijah which was for to come Amen in Luke 10: 17 to 19 and I want you to just as we read this just remember Jesus gives the church power and he never took it away doesn't matter what history shows he never took the power away he never took it away from the church and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all can everyone say all all the power of the enemy all the power of the enemy just let that be gospel tonight all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you Hallelujah you may be seated in the presence of the Lord tonight Hallelujah power that word power it means it comes from the word exusia which I would presume that that's where they get the word exorcize from which is an authority it's a privilege a force a capacity I give you privilege I give you force I give you capacity Hallelujah this is Jesus now giving the church right from the beginning is he the same tonight hallelujah amen are we are we getting prepared for prayer tonight Hallelujah have we come with an expectation that your prayer is going to break through tonight amen or have you just come to just pray and have another prayer meeting because I believe your expectation will be met and if you've come to and you purposed in your heart that tonight we break through tonight we pray through tonight we see change tonight we see material Miracles why because Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever power exusia I give you privilege he says I give the church privilege and I never take it I give the church Force I haven't taken it I give the church capacity competency Freedom Hallelujah you're free to cast The Devil out you're free to take advantage over the devil you're free to be free amen you're free to Rejoice you are free to have Liberty and perfect love in your life and any devil no matter how big or small or wide or fat amen can stand against the force that is within you to speak what is your expectation tonight I give you freedom I give you Mastery I give you superhuman ability Hallelujah I'm just reading the definitions here I give you a token of control I give you influence delegated influence hallelujah amen I give you Authority jurisdiction these are powerful words I give you Liberty you are at Liberty tonight to beat the devil up amen you're at liberty tonight to overcome you're at liberty tonight to walk out of here in total victory over all anxiety depression pressure whatever it is that is being laid on you to hold you on the ground you don't have the walk out the same and if there's anyone that you're thinking about that you've got a burden for they can be changed too Hallelujah let's mean business let's storm the Gates of Hell let's make those Gates crumble tonight if one man Samson under the power of the Holy Ghost under the blood of bulls and goats can carry the gates of Gaza tons of Peace by his power in the Old Testament how much more a blood bought Blood Washed bride of Jesus Christ tonight under the power of the Holy Ghost and the anointing that breaks the yak of the enemy Lord how much more let's keep this real simple Hallelujah Liberty Power right I give you the right I like that I give you the strength Hallelujah I'll never get through this if I get too excited too soon so violence you know both sides wield violence but the violence take the kingdom by force right so now in this context now remember you yes God gives you a violence streak Hallelujah a spiritual religious indignation against the devil against the powers of Darkness he gives you this it's a violence but we'll get into it soon how this violence manifests Hallelujah but what it means here is to urge to constrain overpower by force now remember it can be used for evil too and the evil one the devil uses it a lot and you'll see some similarities for how he treats people how he treats your children how he treats people that you know how he treats those people out there and sometimes how he treats you and tries to come against you just look at the violence but remember the one that's inside you is greater than him Hallelujah and tonight you can stand tonight you can make a make a difference in your own life by standing and recognizing who is in you and how great he is hallelujah to urge to constrain overpower by force to press earnestly forward Hal Hallelujah who's in here tonight with an expectation to press earnestly forward let's not look back remember not the former things neither consider the things of old Hallelujah I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert what does that mean I will do impossible things says the Lord he will do impossible he's promised impossible feets in all of our Lives that's right impossible amen he likes to do it he enjoys it because what he wants to see is you grab your tambourine and begin to dance and rejoice in Victory Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah violence Amen to to to press earnestly forward to rush to pass to be an object of a forceful movement amen I believe Heaven is a forceful movement see the Lord has a has a his will is to forcefully overcome all the works of the devil and to remove the devil out of your life remove the devil out of the church remove the devil out of the earth that's his whole plan to get rid of the devil and he said I give you authority to do it so what are we going to do tonight just pray another prayer or we're going to break through are we going to storm amen we've got needs oh my I believe you know as we get into this end time age the needs are impossible everything's just impossible but we serve an impossible making God hallelujah hallelujah the Lord maybe back in the days the trials wenten so hard but they're hard now and I'm not belittling the things that went on but remember the Bible says the devil's angry because he's got a little time left and our progress spiritual progress is his demise so you put those two things together and you realize that the devil doesn't want you to progress he going to do everything he can he going to put all the crosshairs on you and upon Israel because these two groups are the very two groups that is that are going to bring his demise cuz they fulfill prophecy the violent take the kingdom by F hallelujah hallelujah to to be an object of a forceful movement to force that is to crowd oneself or to be seized hallelujah amen I just want to what have I done here hallelujah Matthew 11 12 to oh yeah I just did this one I just want you I want to read this in the basic Bible English version which is kind of like the um uh the more modern version um because actually the King James puts it in a way that makes it hard to understand and it actually even though both meanings actually mean it means both things because remember the devil just as much as you is fighting and he's got a force and he's trying to bring you down but you're going to bring him down right in your life and dayto day in the battles in the wars so just listen to this and from the days of John the Baptist till now the Kingdom of Heaven is forcing its way in and Men of force take it am I looking at men a force tonight are we men and women a force tonight real for recognize who's inside you and stand because what you cannot progress without the miracles of god there's no way forward without God's Miracles I know me and IA we trade in business we only can go forth with Miracles cuz the devil hates us and the devil hates you and he doesn't want you to progress in any realm he doesn't want you to he wants to beat you down until you're crumpled on the ground crying that's what what he wants and useless Hallelujah but God speaks a word over you oh my Lord God speaks a word over you to rise up my fair one and come away from all that look not to the former things that will crumple you down and beat you down in your mind and rise up in faith hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you know there's only one way forward tonight there's only one way forward for this time onwards from that time as the prophet preached from that time time violence War violence am battles War have you resolved yourself or are you wanting an easy time you wanting a comfortable layer to see in time because if that's your expectation you're not going to get very far Hallelujah be good Andy be good and from the days of John the Baptist till now the Kingdom of Heaven is forcing its way in Lord help me to not go too far right now see the the devil had it all sewn up didn't he 400 years since Malachi right and all that Babylonian religion had come through Judea religion and there was instead of priesthood there was there was Pharisees instead of the Tabernacle and the temple there were synagogues and it had become Babylonian it had become religious powerless and full of The Commandments of men it was religiously strong it was politically strong and it was under the bondage of Rome the devil thought I got this all sign up there's no way that a messiah can come in this situation oh my Lord that's what he thought he thought he got it all sewn up but God sent Elijah Hallelujah God sent the spirit of Elijah to interrupt the status quo to interrupt a powerful band of religious power of political power of Roman power all these powers to sww up the people and God sent the spirit of Elijah he said until the days of John the Baptist since that day the Kingdom of Heaven has forced its way into a place where the devil had it all sew up Hallelujah I asked you this question did it work the devil could not do it the devil did not have enough power did the Messiah come did he die on the cross for us was our sins paid for hallu was the Holy Ghost poured out on the church did the church have a book of Acts Hallelujah we rest our case Hallelujah that's why we can find rest Hallelujah in the word of God in the book of Acts we are a continuation of that book no different the only thing that's different is the seals are open because there's a people when I believe I'm looking at them and part of them that will not taste death and so the full search of your whole life all the way back to Adam everything that Adam lost has been searched over you so that the devil has nothing that he can accuse you of because of the blood and the opening of the word to fully absolve you and justify you from everything of the past look not to the former things neither consider the things of old whether it's good or bad cuz some of the things that you thought was good wasn't good and it will confuse you because why the revelation of Jesus Christ begins to progress in your life he is an Ever presentent God he is trying to make us eternally minded not past or future minded he wants you to exist in the moment so that you can Rejoice with him in the moment cuz he is the moment he is the I am he is the one that can bring the change now tonight you pray in the presence of the I am and not just you in his presence but he's in your presence amenah Hallelujah and if we continue dwelling on the past or the future we will be scrambled two minded and will get amnesia because the devil will get your imagination all anointed and your memory Channel all anointed cuz he's got an access into those Realms amen I just like that so much the Kingdom of Heaven is forcing its way in Oh Glory don't you feel the Kingdom of Heaven is forcing its way in to your life to this Fellowship to this K this community Hallelujah to Wellington amen Force haaz take away by force snatch away now remember the devil can do this too and we saw it on October 7th didn't we he snatched away people of the promised land he took away by force but I want to turn it around and I want you to realize that you can take the devil back from the devil you can snatch it back from him you can take it by force didn't we hear that there is an enforcer of restoration the holy spirit amen why not tonight you send the enforcer of restoration to to cause restoration and make the devil give it back doesn't matter how much he's got a hold of it or how failure or wherever you're at the enforcer Hallelujah is not a respector of persons amen he's a respector of Faith yes sir faith in the promises of God faith in the divine Integrity that God swore by an oath that you would be without spot or wrinkle and that you would be raptured amen oh yes Lord Jesus Hallelujah to seize on with avidity Avid we know the word Avid to eagerly to convey away suddenly woo I think one day that's going to fully materialize and we're going to be conveyed away suddenly hallelujah amen hallelujah eagerly to uh to transport hastily to claim for oneself eagerly Hallelujah you know it's time to get a bit eager it's time to have a have a desire for God it's time to to let that desire be stirred in you hallelujah amen amen you say Lord how what can I do in my life that the desire for you would be stirred amen what is it Lord what would stir the gifts in my life what would it be is it knowing my purpose is it a powerful prayer life is it a conversation with god instead of just reading your Bible for the sake of it what is it Lord is it going beyond the outer court and just being forgiven is it going past the Brazen altar p pass the priests that sing your praise past the altar of incense that prayer altar where your incense is gone before the the nose of God going past it to go Beyond the Veil The Veil that was rent at Calvary the veil of his flesh that was torn Hallelujah tonight we pray where do you pray from are you praying from the outer Court I'm asking everyone from the youngest to the oldest are you praying from the outer court tonight or are you praying from the religious realm or are you praying from the holy of holies where the glories never fail where the light comes from God where the Mana never went stale where the rod of Aaron it came back into an eternal state that state was eternal that state never it was all one moment Eternal you know why my children know this very well we've done this in family altar a few times when that Rod went into the presence of God it came out and it was budding blossoming and fruiting Hallelujah all in one moment it had to because it came into an eternal condition yeah Hallelujah something crossed over God wants you to cross over in prayer tonight cross over Hallelujah Prophet says this and I want you to ask this question where should our violence be aimed should it be aimed at each other should it be aimed at the Devil which one do you choose I believe the devil and don't even aim it at yourself Hallelujah sometimes we aim the violence at ourself and we condemn ourself and we get so down on our own uselessness sometimes but God's not concerned with that if you make it right and you repent Hallelujah you're in Fellowship God rebuke that devil that's hindering you beautiful little girls May the power that raised Jesus from the grave cast that thing away never bother you no more I say that on the authority of God's word you have to get angry with the devil God gives us the victory we got it right now this is the the victory that overcomes the world even your faith I was playing a game the other night with the children and you know for this violence you cannot be afraid we're play Monopoly and anyone that plays Monopoly will know exactly what I'm talking about Hallelujah and I'm going to call it safe mode now the devil wants to put you in safe mode he wants to put a whole bunch of troubles all around your life so that you're afraid to worship you're afraid to respond to the word you're afraid of repercussion and so my children and i' never win monopoly never but somehow I got favors that night and I had hotels all the way down Mayfair and Park Lane or whatever it's called and I had h house all on the other side which was also just as bad and my family all wanted to stay in jail they all wanted to stay in jail because they thought it's safer in jail have you ever been there it's safer in jail right that's what that's what that's what they wanted they they hey they're like we're happy don't they they're very happy to not roll a double CU otherwise they're in trouble and they're going to face the enemy and they're going to die but for you it's not the same see the devil will try trial after trial he will even come into your room and scare you and put fear on you so that you would enter into a safe mode and just be a good little Christian he wants you to be a he doesn't mind you being a good little Christian go to church every day read your Bible every day and just become a religious law abiding Christian happy ass doing good works that's what he want he he he doesn't mind but the the moment he wants he what he wants he wants you to stay in that little jail called safe mode you know your computer sometimes your computer just gets so old at blue screens all the time and and it just doesn't work anymore it just keeps crashing right and then finally it gives up the ghost but you really need that information on the computer you really need to get that off and you and to get this relaunched you've got to go through the computer in safe mode it doesn't let you do everything it doesn't let you communicate properly you can't go on the internet you can't run everything you can just do a very little few little things just enough to get your hard hard driver you know has anyone does anyone know what I'm talking about we're all computer people here e is there anyone that isn't a computer doesn't know what I'm talking about oh good Hallelujah so what is that that's where the devil wants to try and place you in such a condition that you don't want to come out of jail but when you're in jail you can't communicate properly you you your visits are limited you can't really have friends yeah but for us the moment that you become violent and you come out of that jail and you recognize who's inside you and you recognize that your position and you recognize you were given Authority exusia you were given uh uh the the freedom to take authority over every force of the enemy and tread on all the Devils I give you power over all the Devils Hallelujah to tread on all that's not just some whatever you're facing whatever the devil has placed in your life or tried to hinder you come out of Safe Mode come out of the jail come out of that thing and face with violence hallelujah how am I doing for time it's 8:23 what time do we have to finish this 8:30 is it 8:30 sweet we're nearly there you know this um this is a letter that was from the tank command a tank commander in the um in this in the present War his name is aai Simon Tav or TV and he wrote a letter to some media in Israel and it became a national letter and and I think is a very um important um thought here for us to understand the importance of being a United body and not allowing safe mode to hinder your communication to hinder you from being a real Christian a violent Christian someone that is that's going to tear down the devil's Kingdom because to progress from this point on you have to break the gates of hell because the gates if you don't if you're not willing to fight you're going to the gates the hell's just going to put Gates all around you to stop you from progressing but remember this God has called us to a war we're enlisted in an army and God wants us to be in unity and for all your channels of communication you be able to be a good friend to be able to connect with people to be able to connect with the body and not have funny complexes or any memory channels and things that are blocking you from being friends and being able to connect amen amen see the Lord's got the grace in this room tonight to bring us into perfect love and perfect unity and keep us there right and and if any little thing starts to come into the midst of us the love of God just dissolves it and the the the maturity of the body dissolves all of the works of the enemy because of discernment you discern the Antichrist spirit that would come in to try and cause trouble right and I'm not saying that there is that in the church but I'm just giving this word so that you can be prepared because as the prophet says the devil does not want us to stay one big sweet group he'll do everything he can to twist the thoughts in the mind to try and break the the unity but listen to what this tank commander said he says this Hamas cuz remember they're fighting Hamas and this Hamas had been been a a thorn in the sight of Israel for 60 years he says Hamas is stronger than the left now we're talking about a divided political um country very divided and there was protests all over Israel I don't know if anyone followed the news but there it was a very divided country but this guy as they came into this war he began to realize something here he said Hamas is stronger than the left it is also stronger than the right and also bi and Ben G our enemy is stronger than Israeli Hightech and the settlement Enterprise that's the people and the The Entity that's behind the people that are going to claim their land but divided Hamas is stronger than all those entities right the strong stronger than the left stronger than the right Hamas is stronger than T's beautiful soul and has no chance against them nor does the periphery but Hamas has no chance against Israel when we are united and mobilized they Retreat into their tunnels and pray for a ceasefire Romans 8:31 says what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who everyone say who who who can be against us and I want you to repeat this after me my God is for me my God is for who can be against me who can be against me I am a son and daughter of God I'm a son and and I have prevailed over all the works of the enemy I pr greater is heer is he that is in me is in than he that is in the world than he in the world I am willing I am willing to fight against the devil to fight against the devil in the power of the holy ghost power of the who had conquered Satan conquered Satan at Calvary at Cal and sent the Holy Spirit s the Holy Spirit to keep me in Victory to keep me in Victory amen amen hallelujah it doesn't matter how far the war goes how entrenched it may be how hopeless it may seem and it may seem hopeless tonight and it may seem like all hope is gone or you might be on a mountain and you might be rejoicing right now and everyone's in different places because it's an individual walk and if you're on a mountain then it's time to intercede but if you're in a valley just remember we're here with you hallelujah we're United we're a United body World War II and the Germans had just conquered France it does doesn't matter where you're at how violent your enemy may look and the the Nazis were on their way over the the British channel the I don't know what it's called the Channel anyway and they were
