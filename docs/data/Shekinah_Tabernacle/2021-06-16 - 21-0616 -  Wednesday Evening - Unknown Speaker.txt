hallelujah thank you brother isaac thank you musicians amen good evening everyone god bless you amen praise the lord well it's like the good old days praise the lord anyway um let's go to uh let's go to the book of esther tonight we're going to go to easter 8-1 and then we're going to go to revelations chapter 12. amen we serve we serve the almighty god the creator of heavens and earth hallelujah i mean we've got nothing to fear our god's in control amen esther 8 and 1. amen on that day did king hazarus give the house of haman the jew's enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was under her and the king took off his ring that he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews then the king held out the golden scepter towards esther so esther arose and stood before the king and said if it please the king and if i have found favor in his sight and the things seem be right before before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of uh hamadatha the egypt which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king's province provinces for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred then the king of hazara said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews right ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for writing for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may no man reverse then were the king scribes called at that time in the third month that is the month of uh sivan on the three and twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from india under ethiopia and 127 provinces unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews according to their writing and according to their language and he wrote in the in the king of hazarus's name and sealed it with the king's ring and sent letters by post on horseback and riders on mules camels and young uh drummadiers if that's how you say it wherein the king granted the jews which are in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey amen and we're going to go sorry a bit of a lengthy reading there then we're going to go to revelations chapter 12 and uh imagine a a familiar piece of scripture i love reading the end of the book amen hallelujah revelations 12 and we're going to read gonna read in verse 7 down to verse 12. and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuses them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death amen let's bow heads and word of prayer tonight if you've got a need on your heart she's going to lift your hand to the lord amen aren't you glad he hears our prayers gracious lord jesus lord that's what we want lord you can take all this world we

you're still mighty to save so we thank you lord and dear god just pray you'd have your way in our midst lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats tonight um i'd like to you know i feel like it's wednesday so you just kind of jump in there you get done and you go home kind of thing but you know not that we want to be quick but um i want to talk about the the the ordained position that we have in this time now esther you know we read there in the book of esther where where haman had been hung and then all of all of the you know house of haman had been given to esther and um but but really the most important thing that she received was the king's ring i mean receive that segment because that signet if you know any law you know in the old days a law could only really have the um authority behind it if it was sealed with the king's seal you know anyone could write a lot of things they could ride it to sound like the king they could maybe trick a lot of people without that seal underneath the bottom of that document it was null and void it had no impact it had no weight behind it but if the king signed anything to law and put his seal behind it then the whole of the kingdom was behind that seal amen so now that power had been given into esther's hand i meant to can you i'm kind of like in a big echo chamber here you know can you kind of de-echo this it's kind of you know you know but but now that authority had been given to esther and in reality it was always her hers to use right but now she had to actually take what she had that was really her rightful uh possession and now put it into action it's the same thing with you and i we're now we're living in a time not just to talk about who we are but put into action who we are amen is the bride of jesus christ so now we could read here in haggai chapter 2 where where there's a prophecy speaking of zerubbabel we know that haggai was one of the prophets when when the temple in jerusalem was being restored and uh he would say to uh you know haggai 2 and 21 he'd say speak to zerubbabel governor of judah saying i'll shake the hemos in the earth and i'll overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and i'll destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen i will overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and their riders shall come down every one by the sword of his brother in that day i saith the lord of hosts will i take thee o zerubbabel my servant the son of shetheal saith the lord and make thee as a signet for i have chosen thee saith the lord of hosts now we know scripture has compound meaning we know that there was a literal zerubbabel the governor of judah but if you look into the scriptures ruble also speaks of the lord jesus christ where where zechariah had the had the uh vision of you know you know zerubbabel will we'll we'll we'll we'll begin the building and then then the headstone he'll bring forth the head stone with crying's grace grace under it speaking of the gentile bride will be built by god it's not man's building we're not man's handiwork amen we're god's handiwork we are the handiwork of the lord jesus christ we are his masterpiece he's been molding us maybe for some years or maybe just a few moments but as long as we're on his wheel as long as we're being shaped into the image of his word that's a good thing amen so and whatever god starts he's going to finish right he doesn't just there's no two hard basket for god he doesn't have one in heaven it's not in his workshop hallelujah you may think you're a difficult case it don't it doesn't matter to god he doesn't have difficult cases hallelujah so now this cerebral wasn't just speaking to the governor of of judah but speaking prophesying of the lord jesus christ where there'll come a day where god will shake heavens and earth and this cerebral world will become a signet so now it's going to be god is going to put you know put his full authority behind the word like never before sure we saw it in a brief span of time after pentecost where you know god spoke directly to the world through the church and brother ram said that the world will hear direct from god as they did at pentecost because we're being returned back to the faith of the fathers hallelujah so now this signet hallelujah which is our lord is now placed on the hand of the bride we're going to put some things we're going to put some things into law if i can put it that way because remember jesus said to his church whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so the power to bind and loose the devil is placed in the hands of the bride of jesus christ amen it's placed in your hands tonight amen so we should put that power into action right instead of letting that you know like a mosquito at night you just hear this that's like the devil he's annoying right he's real annoying you know maybe from the tropics we get a bit scared maybe it's got dengue fever or malaria but it's just but when you get sick of it after a while instead of just rolling over and saying well if it fill up boys you know i'm sleeping but when you get sick of it that's how the bride has kind of been let the devil beat her around this way that way you've got to live with your problems live with the spirit live with this trouble you know but there's a time when you get sick of it you turn the light on or actually i say there's a man standing present that can turn on the light and you say now where is that annoying mosquito and you just go you know and you just kind of wipe them away and you know he's done that's how we should be with the devil right instead of letting him just buzz around yeah yeah we have the power to squish them what's that power the power to bind them or to lose them hallelujah i mean so but that authority is in the bride of christ it's in it's in the power remember life and death is in the power of the tongue you know you know your tongue is the most supernatural element that you possess hallelujah even even words of unregenerate men are very powerful how about the redeemed of the lord amen so now esther had to so i'm still kind of echoing here yeah you'll get it don't worry there's so many buttons behind that i think it's scary man you can fly 747 after you master that thing anyway so but you know that power is in the bride of christ now esther had to put into law because the king said i cannot reverse what haman did but now a new law can be written now we know that haman's demise if you read the book of esther all began to happen after the king could not rest and he called for the records of the kingdom to come and when the records came open then they then haman begin to make his downfall because the kingdom records came open and then there was and it was written in there how mordecai saved the king's life so it's when the book came open that's when haman began to make his fall i mean the plan was already in motion before the book came open because remember jesus even said when the disciples were sent out with power and authority to cast out devil his head i beheld satan fall from heaven as lightning so jesus was saying even as the church was given that power to cast out devils even before pentecost satan began to fall right but now has come the full time of his fall because because the prophet told us when satan is cast out the bride goes up hallelujah so there's actually a reversal now instead of him being in charge he gets cast the earth and now we go into our rightful position amen in heaven but we must understand but we are seated now together in heavenly places in christ jesus right now amen so don't don't don't put this off in a future thing it's right now louis so a signet as i said it's a small seal especially one set in a ring and it's used instead of a signature to give authentication to an official document hallelujah so we have been given this now who understand who's who who's following me don't be you know because the devil you know the devil wants you to make you think you you have no power you have no authority you have no business trying to tell me what to do who are you to you know come against me and you know try and try and make me get back well we have that barren authority just like the prophet said you can take the smallest policeman on the force he can be literally a two by four and his hat falling over his ears and things but let him go out on the street once blow that whistle hand up that you know hold up that hand and the biggest truck that could just run him over flat has to stop because all the city is behind that man hallelujah you know all of all of heaven is behind you oh yeah this is not us trying to fight the devil in our own ability it's god behind us backing us up hallelujah we're even even moses you know you know moses when he stepped into egypt and he said let my people go and he began to plague he began to plague egypt he's let frogs and flies know he lifted up the staff to different things that wasn't him making those things come to pass that was god in him hallelujah but he was determined he had enough grit amen israel was getting out of here doesn't matter how much pressure the devil puts on amen he is going to have to let go eventually that's the same thing with you and i said hallelujah so when the book came open then then haman's demise begin to come come come into motion if you go ready hallelujah so now as i said as in haggai it said this will happen when he says i'll shake the heavens and the earth now if we turn to hebrews 12 because haggai was speaking of a future time and even the apostle paul would pick it up and he'd say see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on the earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removal of those things that are shaken as of things that are made but those things which cannot be shaken may remain now i think i don't know if it yeah it's probably pretty clear to a lot of us you know if you just look at current events this world is shaking this world is falling apart yes we have the greatest technology probably since the flood you know we have you know we have ways of doing things that they never had even 10 years ago but yet we don't have any answers for anything mental health problems are an all-time high the prophet said this will be a age of mental health problems you know but we have all the drugs we can you know all the all the help we can get all those different things but yet mental health problems have skyrocketed i mean suicide rates have gone through the roof you know poverty even is really bad you know people can can can have a belly full of food but there's no nutrition you know the you know nature's falling apart governments are falling apart the whole world's falling apart why because it's the shaking of those he's shaking heaven and earth but he signified the removing of those things that are shaken because there's a lot of things that we see around us they won't be here in the millennium they're going to be taken away praise the lord hallelujah amen thank you amen i'm glad about that but those things which cannot be shaken may remain amen even uh because so what's what god has been doing is he's been taking our confidence off of man and nations and how even you know anything a man can do but we thank god for everything man can do but he's taking our ultimate confidence off those things and putting it on the word of god sure we go to the doctor we get education we do all those things but our ultimate confidence rests on the word of god does it not i mean just like brother brown he would preach against a lot it he would preach against education but the reason he'd preach against it is because people would rely on the education and forget god that was why he was against it did he take the education take god hey praise the lord that's all good but just don't kick god out and and and whatever you do amen so there is a shaking heaven and earth is being shaken but those things that cannot be shaken may remain the only thing that can remain in this hour is the word of god is a people built into his image that's why we have a kind of stability that the world doesn't have hallelujah amen wherefore so because of this we're receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire hallelujah so we're living in this hour you know there's you know there has to be just like the book of ephesians if you read it you know paul would call them saying you've been you know you heard the word of truth you know you believed your seal to the day of your redemption you know but then he says now let's press on to the high calling in christ where we've grown to the statue of the fullness the image of christ hebrews 4. but if you read church history they aim at that then they relax and then eventually that drift will continue down into a dark age but now the prophet says we've come to another ephesians again so we've come back round again i've probably been saying these things for you know i've you know i've said this a bit but i want to emphasize these things so now i've come back to that ephesians again but now there's a there's there's a people on the earth that god uses to break that cycle of revival and death where they don't just aim at and say yes lord i'm going to become exactly like you by your grace and then just drift but they actually surrender themselves completely to the word and believe it and they go all the way in and became made into his very image into the fullness of christ and we're living in that time and it's god's divine favor and grace upon you that causes that to happen you know caleb and joshua just like the rest of the spies really but they received a revelation of the land was theirs that's the only thing that made the difference between the two groups they both saw the same giants the same problems the same land the good things and the bad things but two received a revelation when they heard moses preaching that you're going to go and take the land they received a revelation i mean that that was their inheritance but the others didn't receive that revelation so the only difference between us and you say anyone else is divine revelation hallelujah that's why we should say thank god you've become real to me does it become real to us all hallelujah you remember that time that hour when you met him you know brother graham says it's like branding cattle hallelujah you take a hot iron i don't know if they do it anymore like this they got it tags but yo we used to have my great uncles branding irons used to be buy our fire at home but i think my parents still have them they would never use when i was alive you know but you know but yeah they put that thing in a stool they take that red hot iron that brand you know branded side and that let it go go kinky you know kicking and stomping and snorting because they got a lot of pain they you know jumped around the corral but they knew who they belonged to and yes the same thing with you and i trust when you met god you may be a lot of snorting and crying and shouting and whooping and you know but but by the end of it you knew who you belong to hallelujah and you're carrying now a sickness hallelujah amen hallelujah now if we take the parable of the prodigal son we see when he came to himself now now we are all in this parable i trust you're not the older brother or the other brother that just that wasn't happy to see grace extended to someone i trust you're not that category and you're the prodigal son amen because that who uh who has been forgiven much loveth much i mean so if god has really forgiven you then grace can be extended because grace was received amen but if grace was never received it cannot be extended to someone else and just and your life will be full of criticism of other people but so here he is he's a man who who takes his inheritance spoils it you know it goes to a far country spends it all but he's sitting in a pig pigpen and he comes to himself he realizes my father's servants have it better than me hallelujah who knows the story i love these stories i love the parables there you go i enjoy it so so he comes and brother bram says actually the angel lord came into the pig pen and brought him to his right mind because remember not one of us could actually come to our right mind in our own selves it wasn't actually you and your humanity or me just decided one day i'm going to be a christian you should have been a big amen right there it's not us it's not within man the bible says to seek after god it's not actually within us humanly to seek after him but god had to put something within us that at his predestined moment something goes there's got to be more to life than this there's got to be more to it than this you know and god begins to move maybe you're raising the message maybe you came out of the world like like myself but something in you just says there's got to be something and god and that's god that's the only lord coming to you coming to your right mind you begin to walk hardly you begin to find yourself walking in the scripture in familiar places and then finally you come to a place where the father steps out but then because of our past we think there's no way we could be restored to a son of god we're just going to be a second-class citizen in the kingdom but god don't want second-class citizens in his pride his bride is meant to be a joint heir that's what he wants with you and i am we're never meant to be servants we're meant to be bride we need to be family amen and and we had to come to realization because we always were family amen you do not become a son or a daughter by the new birth you already were and the reason you're a son or daughter is you can get born again hallelujah so he comes back in his heart he's thinking i'm not worthy to be a son i'll just be a servant he comes back to his father and he says to us father you know i've sinned against heaven against you i'm not worthy to be your son but then yeah the father's not interested in his you know how he feels about what he did he says no i want to restore my son he was lost but now he's found i'm going to restore him back to sonship again so he calls his servants and says yo get the best robe get the ring holy what is that a signet hallelujah the father's ring put it on his hand signifying here's authority him speaking is the same as me speaking if the bride has surrendered to god amen she's speaking the same as him speaking brother ram said if you you just get a spirit-filled spirit-led man or woman of god speaking the word of god across their lips is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go nothing can stand before that man or woman i happen to believe that amen hallelujah you know where brother brown would quote constantly the scripture he that believeth on me the works that i do he shall do also and that's not just for the prophet that's for the bride of christ what ye say you know if two agree on earth i'll do it amen if you speak to this mountain do not doubt and say because of the sea it shall be done and it's not just talk about figurative things talk about literal things getting rid of literal devils i mean literal sickness literal problems i believe it we're here to fulfill that scripture say lord fulfill that scripture in my life amen you say well that's quite a challenging thing it's not challenging because god is the one who actually fulfills it it's not your ability that makes the world come to pass all we have to surrender to it say lord come and live hallelujah amen that's why we should be rugged in our faith amen all things are possible to them that belief you know many times we say there's nothing impossible with god but but jesus said all things are possible to them that believe that means there's nothing impossible with you hallelujah amen so he comes back you know his father is not interested in in him wanting to be a servant because of his past just like the lord he doesn't care really about what we've done he just wants us home that's all he's interested in he he doesn't care whether he knew where we'd go he wasn't surprised whatever pig pen you woke up in he wasn't shocked he's you know god is not having an emergency his program is rolling right on he's not he's not worried he's not saying how's this all going to come together he knows exactly how it's come together you know i think i've said it here but yeah i kind of marvel at these things you know in a war if you can actually get within the intelligence of the enemy you've got them like the uh allies they got the enigma code breaking machine and they found out what the nazis doing and what the japanese were doing they got within their code system so they could actually decipher their communications find out what they're doing and that's a big part of it that's how they won the war now you think about god imagine this is an enemy because this is what the devil does the devil said i'm going to fight this guy yeah now this guy he knows all things he knows when the enemy's going to do it how he's going to do it why he's gonna do it we're exactly down to the finite pico second which is one of the smallest museums of time right you know when when when natural armies fight they kind of guess well i think the enemy will do this in this time frame and this is yeah there's a plus or minus of a guesstimation right right it can be a good guesstimation but god knows exactly when the enemy's going to do this and this and how he's going to do it and exactly and he's never guessing he knows exactly and that's the kind of enemy the devil says i'm going to fight and beat the devil is deceived how can you ever defeat an enemy who knows exactly when you're going to show up the methods you're going to use the tactics you're going to use how how can you beat that kind of enemy you can't hallelujah so we have nothing to fear amen sometimes you say i don't really understand what's going on well i just say the footsteps of the righteous audit of the law see everything's actually going okay hey i can't remember who said it but the other bride's in good shape hallelujah i think we're in good shape hey the blood makes us in the best shape hallelujah amen so the father then you know the son tries to say he says in luke 15 21 and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe we have the best robe and she would be as grounded unto her that she'd be arrayed and fine and clean and white for the fine linen as the righteousness of saints this is revelations 19. amen see let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come we're living the scripture do you know and his wife had made herself ready and to her she was granted she should be a raid and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints so this is the best robe hallelujah this is not us trying to get in a white throne judgment by our works that no that's not that kind of thing i mean but this is the best robe we have you're wearing it right now i don't know if you i don't know if you're aware but you know when you wake up you're dressed when you go to bed you're dressed you're dressed all the time in this hallelujah that makes me happy i don't know about you it should you know thank you and put on him a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet so what is that now that's the to me that's the father's ring whatever he says is as if i'm saying it hallelujah hallelujah amen even even if saying isaiah 61 and 10 oh greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels hallelujah amen the scripture tells us we are joint is yes and if children then heirs is of god joint is with christ if so be we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together amen now this word joint air it actually denotes a union it means cohere but it but but it denotes a union in the greek amen so we're joining us but we're uni we'll become one with him amen hallelujah now if we look into this where where it says in ephesians 4 and verse 13 grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption and that word sealed it means to stamp for security or for preservation hallelujah so we have been we've received and this this word also means with a signet or with a private marks not only have we got a signal in our hand but we're being sealed with a signal god says this is my bride she is part of me devil no trespassing you can't take their souls you can't take their faith in me i remember he has a right to your mind he has a right to make you sick make you trouble but he can't touch that soul amen so just because you have mind bells doesn't mean you're not a christian doesn't mean you're not an overcomer you know there's going to be a lot of battles before this war is finished i mean but the conclusion is victory is certain i like how brother paul says that victory is certain hallelujah so we know we're on the winning side you know i've been thinking a lot about you know i wonder when you know in wars you take great great conflicts when the losing side realizes they can't win you know it may not look like it on the outside but there comes a time when one side realizes we don't have the manpower we don't have the firepower we don't have the resources we cannot sustain this conflict and the devil's got to come surely to a point he won't say it on the outside remember like get in here you know gideon had a dream where that well you know that thing rolled into the camp of the enemy and i know actually the enemy had the dream who knows the story gideon went down to search out the camp and then he's there and the other had two guards of the enemy camp saying i had a dream last night what was the dream well this thing rolled down to camp but it destroyed the whole camp and you know and then the other guy interpreted the dream saying well actually that's gideon's going to destroy us basically it didn't they didn't show it on the outside but actually their their defeat had already been foretold hallelujah you know and then even even rahab would give the report to the spies of of of the morale of the soldiers of jericho on the outside that their helmets on their weapons ready though they're on the battlements ready to fight but she told the spies the hearts of all the men have actually melted gone all because of you hallelujah so the devil may look like a tough burly fellow on the outside but on the inside he's gone hallelujah how do you break an army you break its spirit yeah sure it can bluff a lot but if you break its spirit it's gone hallelujah and we our enemy is a he's got a broken spur amen sure he'll bluff it to the end he'll bluff it all the way to the lake of fire when he's thrown in but hey he must realize surely we read in the scripture he's been cast down to the earth i think we didn't read that actually the next verse there in revelations 12 but he's come down to the earth with great angers he knows he has but a short time now wouldn't you think if you're going to win that you wouldn't run out of time right but he knows he's got a short time so he knows actually it's it's it's victory ahead but not for me but he doesn't show that that's why the prophet always told us you've got to call the devil's bluff you've got to call us bluffs how many times will the prophet stand and say satan my lord jesus defeated you that down calvary sure you don't mind me but you mind the one that's you know has sent me and the blood of jesus christ defeated you that day you're still a defeated being take your hands off god's property and the devil had to take his hands off god's property amen and that same authority to cast the devil out is in the bride of christ today amen hallelujah the apostle paul would write in the book of ephesians i'm trying to get through this ephesians 3 8 it says unto me whom less and least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god so the apostle paul is saying that now is a time that you're going to know all the powers in heavenly places at your disposal amen the prince of powers and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god now we know when god teaches anything it's not just theory it's it's practical so god wants to prove to you your position amen he wants to prove to you the power and dominion you have over satan all the hordes of hell amen that's why he sent but the reason that he would do this is not that you would just rejoice that the devils are subject to you like the apostles said when they came back when they were anointed by the lord to go and cast out devils they don't rejoice and this really but rejoice that your names are written in heaven hallelujah so now now the manifold um the principals and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church ultimately is that our names are written in heaven right and because our names are written in heaven then the devil must be subject unto us amen hallelujah well what about judas sure he was given that authority but he didn't go all the way to pentecost what about those who have gone all the way to pentecost right hallelujah because of your seal to the day of your redemption then therefore you are sealed until you get where into glory you are sealed to the day of your until you get to your destination and nothing can break that seal remember brother kaidra at that camp you says it's like you know the devil can do this to you and he can do this to you you know and he can do all kinds of things but that seal's still there amen you know brother braham said that a man or woman can be so surrendered to god till even the devil doesn't know what to do with him that means i'll plague them with this i'll give them this sickness i'll give them this trouble trouble in the family trouble from their past trouble in this whatever sickness cancer trouble all these things but then somehow this person because they stay surrendered to god they just go through it you know we may not necessarily you know when i used to sail when i was young we didn't i didn't surf every wave sometimes i submarined through a lot but the boat was still there i was still alive so sometimes we may not crest every wave sometimes we may submarine right through it but that's all right as long as we come out the other side and god will cause us to come out the other side amen hallelujah amen praise the lord you know you come to a realization you know my dad always told me when i was getting my sea legs said the worst thing that can happen is you just get wet you know everything's all right and you come to a front yeah that's right actually well there's a few other things but you know but you know really god has our lives in his hands when you really think about this great god that made all things hallelujah created time and space and you know for ordained you you know i love it where he speaks to job you know job has all these questions on his mind he doesn't know what's going on in his life and god doesn't come down and address those he says where were you when i created the you know you know laid the foundation of the world and the sons of god you know sang for joy and you know and you know and he's trying to get job to see job you were with me and not just with me you were in my mind when i made all things when the lamb was slammed before the foundation of the world amen when that lamb was slaying your name was written on the book of the lamb amen before the foundation of the world amen you're part of me job i saw you rejoicing i saw you praising god yeah i saw you being your being thankful rejoicing to having victory over the enemy hallelujah and what does this message come to do it's come to get us to see that we have come from god we're going back to god i mean that's why brother brown the last part of his ministry he had he you know he'd use this phrase you're a predestined seed gene of god amen and he used it quite a lot the last yo 1965 i believe in there because he's trying to get the bride to see you're predestinated so your destiny is predetermined yep what what is that destiny to him that overcometh will sit on my throne with me as i sat down on my father's throne so our destiny is we're going to come through life but we're made to be an overcomer you know people are just built a certain way you know you take a first 15 team the prop is built to be a prop right the lock is built you know he's up here the props out here you know the fly half is here but they're all but they're but their body shape they're built to be that position you know you see world class rowers are uh this big kind of this why they're just machines but they're built to be rowers and normally if it's the one that's got a cox on the end who just says stroke stroke you know they aren't these big mammoth people they're these little buddy fellows but they're built to be a right who's following me you know we're built a certain way we've got certain qualities that the devil don't know nothing about i mean certain qualities and i'm not talking about physical qualities i'm talking about in our soul kind of qualities and to be part of this word amen hallelujah we've been built to do a job amen that job is to be a serpent bruiser all the days of our life hallelujah amen according now sorry we're going back to um ephesians 3 and 10 to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church and the uh the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him it says in ephesians 2 but god who's rich in mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus so he's actually made us to sit in this position this is not us saying i want to sit in heavenly places in christ jesus no god says i'm going to make you sit there i mean and this this heavenly places if you look in the book of ephesians it's also the same word where it speaks about high places so when it says in ephesians 10 i mean sorry ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now that word high place is the same as heavenly places so what happened is adam and eve were in heavenly place in christ jesus but then they fell the devil took their place as a god over the earth but now the roles are being switched by the blood of jesus christ right the word has actually literally taken us from being the devil's whipping boy to now we are the head and he's the tail amen hallelujah so the devil's been squatting in heavenly places in our place of power and authority but now there's a people on the earth who are kicking him out of that place i mean that's why you know that's why there's always opposition when you go and take a promise of god there's always opposition you've got sickness in your body the devil tells you no you can't have it all you got you know you want to find peace for your soul he says no you can't have it you need the baptism the holy ghost says no you can't have it what's that as the devil trying to kick you out of getting into that position amen but we've got to recognize we have a god who wants us in that place he said i will i i i wish above all you prosper in health hallelujah didn't he say that amen and he said all that the father has given me will come to me and all that comes to me i'll know why it's cast out so it means all that come to me i'm going to give the holy ghost to amen that's how i read the scripture amen but the devil try and say it's not for you you've gone too far you've done done too much wrong how can you you know you have no right to it but that's just the devil trying to kick you off your promise amen just like a nested there was a lot of enemies that still had authority to try and kill them but they had to write another law amen that they could actually defeat their enemy amen hallelujah i'm gonna um he says in god of this evil age and the entire word of god and complete was headed up in a body called jesus christ and their god made me pay for my sins and am there then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil say every devil we have power and authority over every devil oh if we could only believe what god has given i believe our eyes are coming open though but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you but if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move it you'll never use it but if you are seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you do yeah just like i just comes to mind you know the testimony of christine's sister melanie seeking the holy ghost she went for you know alter calls and things so many times and you know she's so hungry to you know but she was afraid that the devil would try and come and get her you know if if he you know if she ever said get behind me satan yeah and then there was one time where where elana ran into christine's room if i get this wrong you can you know she'll line this out later but you know you know yeah alana had just given her heart to the lord and then something happened and she comes into christine's room says i'm not going to be a christian anymore i'm not going to be a christian anymore and then christie says well do you want to pray i don't know if god's real and you know and then she just said without thinking do you want to pray and then they begin to pray the prince of god came down and they were shouting and rejoicing and melanie was sharing christine's room she got up started praying and she was seeking the holy ghost but you know the devil was there to try and stop her receiving it and so she was afraid that if if so melanie was afraid that if she ever said satan get behind me satan will just grab her but she had to overcome that fear and say satan get behind me i'm going to get the holy ghost yo because the devil was telling her you won't get it you've done this many times you're not going to get it and she said satan get behind me in the name of jesus christ the holy ghost fell on her and made her a new creature why the devil was squatting on her promise and she had to cast him off the promise to get the promise hallelujah amen that's what we've got to do too yes i've been walking with the lord for a long time you've still got to cast the devil off your promise there's more promises to obtain amen and we're going to keep kicking the devil off until these bodies are changed that's right amy we're gonna put into law put it into action just like esther had to i mean she can just sit there with a signet ring and say well someone else will do it no she was placed in a position to save her people hallelujah amen and that's how we've got to be you know people say well i've done too much wrong i can never return brother ram says if you're a son you have a right to return if you're a son and daughter of god it doesn't matter what you've done where you've gone what you've said what you've done he said if you're a son and daughter of god you've got a right to return you've got a right to a jubilee you've got a right to come back have you got a right to meet the living god because you're a son or daughter of god nothing can keep you from the promise hallelujah so we have a right you say i've gone too much well no no even the apostle paul said i was a blasphemer i made others blaspheme put them in prison did great havoc against the church but god did not change his mind about the apostle paul amen hallelujah if he's made up his mind about you he doesn't change his mind about you he cannot change his mind about you amen even if your past is very much still alive yeah god don't even attribute it to you if you've got the new birth hallelujah when when when abraham was told by god to take isaac and go off from up up up on the mountain he said take your son your only son now hold on let's just go back to that view we could say hold on god what about ishmael abraham is the biological father of ishmael they could do a dna test right but that was abram's son it was the same body but he was a different man right but his name was change and that h is actually the breath of god was breathing to abraham so abram was changed to abraham the breath of god was breathed and that's what the h represents and so his name was changed because he received a new birth heller so when his name was changed his past wasn't attributed to him anymore it was attributed to abram it wasn't it could not be attributed to abraham because he was a new creature in christ hallelujah that's why god said take your son isaac your only son and go offer him up on the hill but ishmael was running around talk his pass go talk to him hey dad how you doing think about it you say well yeah my past is very much alive and god's mind is dead yes amen hallelujah amen hallelujah so you know we don't we don't need to worry about our past we're new creatures in christ jesus if the devil tries to bring that thing up again no no you've got to kick him off say satan i'll tell you where you're going satan you can't be born again satan there's no blood for you you've got no atonement you've got no advocate you've got no high priest like me hallelujah and you have a right to kick the devil off now i'm just going to leave it there but i just want to just put it to you who's got the ring on their finger amen brother ram said that we actually received a wedding band of unmerited pre-destiny grace before the foundation of the world hallelujah so you've got the signet ring already on you didn't even realize it amen the lord said whatsoever ye say amen whatever you loose on loose in earth shall be loosed in heaven while you bind another shall be bound in heaven if you say to this mouth if two agree on earth concerning anything i'll do it he says i will not withhold anything from them that walk uprightly amen well is that up rightly based on my performance and and and my thought pattern over the date no the blood of jesus christ makes us walk uprightly hallelujah it's not us trying to obtain some nirvana state in our own ability and then now we can we can stomp on every devil that comes against us no it's god that places in the places us in that position yes sir but we have to use that position hallelujah and this is the season this is the bride's hour amen hallelujah brother i was talked about a quick short work that would check the earth i believe we're living in that hour living in that moment hallelujah so now we have been given all authority over all the forces of hell amen all of it it's all defeated we just got to push it back and claim what's our god-given inheritance amen hallelujah amen let's stand tonight shall we hallelujah you have a right to return amen amen amen amen let's um can the musicians come forward please tonight amen but isn't our god god the devil tries to come against you say satan get out in the name of jesus christ amen you're a defeated being every every spirit amen we'll be tried by every spirit but that doesn't mean every spirit will beat us we'll just go from one battle to the next but we have the victory we're more than conquerors through jesus christ our lord hallelujah amen can we sing that song in heavenly armor of we've entered the land i think it says we will but we have entered amen sickness is fighting you you can get rid of in the name of jesus christ the lord will give me grace to go through it allah you don't need to worry don't need to fear anything amen do you have a key in heaven the armor within to

demise of the enemies of the people so father i pray oh god when we lord we come against the enemy may we not uh they would not be gentlemen about it lord jesus we need you to address him for what he
