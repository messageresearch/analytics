empty-handed but we always come away full and refreshed in the the presence of God hallelujah I had a message to uh greet uh Isaac and his wife from Cape [Music] Town and I couldn't forget the [Music] name my mother called me Isaac because there was something funny I think when I was going to be born I think the placenta apparently was is a condition where it's at the bottom of me and then I guess when it something happens in it the placenta ruptures you'd know what the term is used to be reasonably fatal back in the old days when they couldn't do much about it um so I ended up being a cerian but my mother had a promise from the Lord that said I'll give you this son and of course Isaac is like the promised son so that's so I was a struggle to get here but you know if God's got a purpose and a cause then his purpose and his cause will stand you know and uh David was telling me there was a certain General in the um US Army during the Civil War you know when the bullets were flying and the Cannons were blasting and there was war war and everything all around him he just wasn't phased one bit he's just walking around chatting and talking and a I think a guy from the media was there and he said you know why are you like this can't you see and everyone's diving away and ducking for cover and dodging the bullets and he said look I'm not going to go one minute before my time the Lord's got a plan and a purpose for me if I'm not if I'm going to die today I'm going to die today but if not I ain't going to die no bullets are going to hit me so I'm just going to walk around and

to go today uh let's just start here uh in Ephesians 1 and we're going to read here Ephesians 1 uh 3-6 and we're just going to um uh yeah then you can have your seats this morning amen amen amen so I'd like to speak about we have we have an high priest amen I just pray the Lord will put such a confidence in him uh in US for him this morning Our God's not silent he's not distant he's not sleeping he's not pursuing or he's not busy he's Mindful and he's working in every life I believe in every situation amen so amen says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the Beloved oh my I like that don't don't you amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen if you have a need just want to raise it amen raise your hand just say Lord remember me today dear God we're so thankful we can come into your presence Lord and we're so thankful Lord that we are not missed by you Lord you see every one of us Lord you see every need every desire every question every every struggle oh God and we're so thankful Lord before we ever stepped into time you made a way Lord we love you so much we thank you dear God we just want to ask may you just Lift us into your presence this morning like ever before father I pray you would touch every heart oh God reach down to the deepest part of ourselves Lord and Lord rearrange and do what you want to do Lord we want to commit the service into your hands we are asking that it would leave human control it would come under your Great Divine control Lord we're so thankful that you first loved us Lord and we love you in return we just want to pray you'd be all those who are streaming today be all those who are sick and body father you know what we are going through Lord we're so thankful that you're our high priest Can Be Touched by the feeling of our infirmities today so may you bless your word Lord as as we have just read it dear God I pray multiply it Lord and Feed Us oh God from your great word we love you we thank you for this day Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I'd like to speak about how we have a high priest and you know uh I just love the scripture I think it was Lao actually put on the um brothers and sisters there's interview with a uh brother there in New York and he and I think one of these scriptures here really gripped him and he became a Believer but you know we were watching this and Christine said you know that's really a bride kind of a scripture you know and when you think about where God has chosen us and him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen that you know I believe that we have come to a stage in our journey our trust we have where we're not trusting in our own ability you know we're not trusting in our own merits or you know that we've really realized in ourselves that our own righteousness is but filthy rags in his sight that that we're not approaching him with our ability our track record or anything we could humanly bring but only his blood can we present amen it's only his sacrifice that matters it's it's nothing we can do amen and now that doesn't mean we just say well what's the point in trying or serving him no we should serve him with all of our hearts all of our mind soul mind and strength because he's worthy amen but it's really him that makes us righteous it's not our own selves so you know so I just want to I want to just go through there was a um very interesting quote that I that I read uh during the week I thought it was very striking brother says now my prayer is that the same person will open to us the scriptures tonight it's a very timely scripture reading because we're again in the resurrection in the Easter season now you say it's not Easter today no it's but it's springtime life is coming forth amen and actually we are continuously in an Easter a Resurrection season we're living in the Rapture season so I think this applies very nicely amen so um and I think it's one of the greatest scriptures that's more neglected than any Scripture um I know of being preached on is the Ascension of the Lord Jesus what he did after his resurrection I thought there was a very striking comment that you know there's a uh um you know one of the greatest neglected scriptures is what he did when he became our high priest he's still our high priest today because when you think about it it's very easy just to talk about a historical God and what he did and we praise him for what he did but what is he doing amen and we're going to realize that you know I know this is I'm preaching to the choir today and we all know he's a personal God and he's here to meet our needs he's mindful of every situation he cares about you and I more than we care about about ourselves amen he loves us more than you know we can even fathom but you know he's not distant he doesn't he doesn't close his ears to our prayers he cares about what we're going through he's not the silent God you know that just sits up in heaven like this and watches his plan unfold but he's working in the lives of men and women boys and girls around the earth that his word would be fulfilled and if we can just view him in a greater way in this way you you as I've said I'm preaching to the choir you know but I think maybe it's just is helpful for me to remember he's not he he's not distracted he's not far away somewhere you know he cares about you and I he's actively finding us he's keeping us you the god that found us is not going to lose us he's not going to he saved us to keep us amen I heard a sister overseas say I thought that such a outstanding comment he saved us to keep us I mean he didn't save us to lose us you know he didn't he didn't save us to do a halfway job he's going to complete what he started amen and if he's going to complete what he started no devil and hell can stop him and our and our own Humanity can't stop him neither I mean God will do what he wants to do and I think it's such a privilege where by his grace we can get behind what he's doing and mean we can say Lord I'm here you know I you I have no ability but I'm available amen and that's what he wants he wants people to be available amen that he can work through it's not what we think we can do it's what we know he can do that matters amen so I thought this was a very outstanding thing now the Lord he did not just sit down on the tomb after his resurrection because his work wasn't completed it wasn't finished and the ones at the grave that morning were forbidden to even touch him but that night the bidden to come and feel his hands he forbid his mother to touch him said I've not yet ascended unto my father uh my God and yours and he had not yet he would um he would only ready to do his great high priest work at that time he had just been anointed so so he so he is now he is now our high priest he's our intercessor he's our mediator he's our advocate he is actively working on our behalf right he is not the silent God but he is the same yesterday today and forever he is alive and well now many people will look through history and criticize you know what the church has gone through down through seven Church ages they'll look in the Dark Ages and say well you know if God is God how can he let his children be burnt at the Stak and fed to lions and horrible acts of torture and things done and you know it's like he just became the silent God they say where was he but you know people forget that God has had a plan down through seven Church ages from Calvary to now and you know there had to be a time because Jesus said unless a corn of wheat goes and dies and falls in the ground it abides alone but if it but if it comes forth it'll bring forth much fruit now he wasn't just talking about his own self but he's talking about the church that that sure because the day of P the book of Acts the day of Pentecost it wasn't a harvest it was just a quick manifestation of the maturity of the Sons and Daughters of God Holy Ghost working in power but then the church had to go from there down to the around the Dark Ages to come forth in the Restoration in the end time and so now when people look at history they think God doesn't care you know he just left his children to be massacred and things but they had an expression to manifest you know every season we you know we're in spring now we weren't in Spring a few months ago it was cold it was hailing there was snow around and so nature couldn't manifest like it could now but it had it season season then but now it's a different season now life is coming forth it's the same thing with the Dark Ages you under that persecution of that false Church you know went down underground it was planted for for a resurrection and now we're living in that spring that summer time Hallelujah but you know a Critic would write a book called The Silent God he said now God through thousands of years of Dark Ages would sit still and never move a hand and watch faithful Martyrs go to the Lion's pits be burnt Ro um by the Romans um assassination of all kinds women stripped of their clothes set on fire long hair with tar burn them remember short hair began in Rome and and women of Christians had long hair they di them in to and set them a fire and burn them and them naked fed them to lions and this Rider goes to say where is that God says oh the blindness of man sometimes did you not know that that seed had to die he never tried to deliver them he they went down in Victory and that's the main thing in life that we go down in Victory if it's by the way of the Grave it's by the body change we go by in Victory in faith amen that we do not fear what man can do unto us amen you it doesn't matter what happens to this body but we go victorious in faith maybe because because the faith that God has given us the world can't take it from us the devil can't take it from us circumstance can't take it from us no if God given you faith God will keep that faith in you Hallelujah so we can stand with such an assurance the Lord is our helper amen he's our strength and our Shield am mean we have a high priest who is who is who is who is standing for us in this hour Hallelujah now we read in the church ages I don't have the scripture here but he said y y John um you know Revelations chapter 1 it says that John turned to look to a man you know like the son of man walking among the seven golden candlesticks and then at the end of that chapter the interpretation that symbol was the seven golden candlesticks are the seven churches now we understand from The Book of Revelation that it is not just the condition in those seven churches was a prophetic thing speaking of the future so but it was showing that Jesus Christ is walking down down from Calvary through the book of Acts down into this time he's been walking with his children all the way down through and he will not stop walking with us amen he was there in the Dark Ages he was there in the Coliseum he was there in the torture chambers he was there in prison amen he was there with Martin Luther and down through the reformation and he's here today amen he's the same yesterday today and forever am mean see and it's not the condition or the state we find ourselves in dictates whether he's with you or not no he's with you because he said mean he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's the promise our God has made amen and we can rest in that promise because he said so me he says now think of it not uh not one believer of any age need to cry in his heart oh that I might have been back there in the first age when the apostles were first set out we don't need to cry that it would have been nice but we don't need to we don't need to cry if only I was back there no there is no need to look back look up Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches throughout all ages Behold Him who was the same yesterday today and forever and who never changes neither in essence or in his ways um where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in their midst and not only in the midst as a complacent onlooker this is what some people think he's just complacently um an onlooker or a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustain and Giver of all gifts to the church hallelujah amen so he is our life and our sustainer praise God hallelujah I'm so thankful that he is my life and my sustainer I'm not sustaining myself I'm not keeping on this Pilgrim journey by My Own Strength but it's God keeps us on the straight and narrow hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord now there's many things that the we know you know I just want to deal with one thing before we go back to um him being our high priest now because he had to carry you know there's that song that we um tried to sing last Sunday that we used to sing a while ago living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away Rising he justified me freely forever one day is coming a glorious day so now in the Old Testament because we know that the um uh the Apostle Paul would say the law was a shadow of good things to come so all the all the sacrific in the Old Testament pointed to Jesus Christ and we can get a greater understanding of what he has done in real form when we look back into the shadow now during the time of atonement once a year the high priest would go and with the blood and sprinkle The Mercy Seat now this could only be done by the high priest it could not be done by any other it could not be done by any other priest it could not be it was only the high priest that could do it now he had the privilege of going once in a year into the holy of holies to sprinkle the blood I mean of the bulock and you know you know upon the mercy seat and this was for this was for the sins of the people now only he could do this didn't matter how good or moral we were just say if we're back there you know you know during the Old Testament time we could have the most outstanding family you know never put a foot wrong sincerely love the Lord not you know it's not a family tradition but a genuine love for God you know loving him and all these things but yet even with that we we needed someone to come and atone for our sins and so now the high priest could could go on once a year with the blood and I'm going to read this oh we'll just read this here and he shall um take the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do that um and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat and he shall make an atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel and because of their transgressions and all their sins and so shall he do for the Tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness and there shall be no man in the Tabernacle of the congregation when he goes into to make an atonement in the Holy place until he come out and have gone sorry and have made an atonement for himself and for his household and for all the congregation of Israel so it doesn't matter how sincere we were he had to go do that job we couldn't we couldn't we couldn't offer the blood on our own behalf but a but a high priest had to and do that now we know that the levitical high priest was just a fallen man that was just put into a high priest but now we have a high priest Which is far greater than that amen that it's not just a you know a man in an office that comes and goes and changes but we have a high priest that abides continually the Son of God who maketh for who who ever liveth to maketh intercessions for us amen so now there was so so there was one part of it was that he had to go and and and and give the offering on behalf of the children of Israel but now he also but then also in this is there there was there was two goats one of the goats we read about was killed for the sin offering but then there's the other one was the was the uh what we call the scapegoat and so now Lots would be cast to which goat would be the goat given for sin and the other one would be the scapegoat now the scapegoat would carry the sins of the people into the Wilderness now we know these all represented Jesus Christ okay so in the old there was there was a scapegoat there was a sin offering goat there was the high priest there was The Mercy Seat they're all separate things right but Jesus Christ was all these things he is our offering he is our high priest he is The Mercy Seat he is the scapegoat remember because the devil is not the scapegoat the devil has no part in Redemption right he has no part in this no this is all Jesus Christ being reflected and so he had to so this so Aaron would um lay both his hands upon his head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions and all their sins and putting them upon the head of the goat and he shall send them away at the hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness and the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited and he shall let the goat uh let go the goat in the wilderness am mean to dying he carried our sins far away amen so so this goat had to be placed be led Away by hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness and this is so that when that when that goat was taken into that Wilderness place the man could get away from the goat that the goat couldn't follow him back you know was this wasn't an unfit man or someone who could be followed but it had to be one who was fit now Jesus when he was he was he was you could say in a way he was well he was forsaken on Calvary where he would cry out my God my God why is Thou forsaken me because he was manifesting being our scapegoat who knows you know who's heard oh that person's a scapegoat this all the blames on that person and see now many times the scapegoat Among Us is someone who they don't they just made the scapegoat but Jesus was willingly our scapegoat because he knew that our sins and our iniquities had to be carried far away they had to be taken from us as far as the east as from the west and so and so he was he was led into a Wilderness and what was that Wilderness he was led into he he with all of our sins and iniquities upon Him took them to hell I mean so he so so he took them at a place not inhabited by man I mean that man shouldn't dwell in right so they were carried far away now this goat this goat was had to be had to be abandoned and you could say he was abandoned that day on Calvary where he says my father wise th forsaken me and so he carried them far away now I'm so thankful he did this for us amen he didn't just put them in a you know somewhere that could be could be gotten by us no he carried them far away that all of our because remember the atonement wasn't just for the for the Salvation of our souls it was for healing of the body amen so he carried all of our sins our iniquities all of our guilt our shame he carried them all far away Hallelujah so that that that we don't bear them no more amen because he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with the stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted I mean Afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a sheep to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth hallelujah hallelujah so he carried our sins far away amen so he didn't just heal us but he but he but he dealt with our sin amen so the sin question is over in God's mind when he was on Calvary he said it is finished in his mind I've paid this in full this is not an interest payment this is not just a part payment this is not a you know those kind of things it was paid in full that day on Calvary so now if the sin question is finished in his mind I pray it's finished in your mind that that that your sin question has that been answered by the blood of Jesus Christ I mean you're no longer wrestling with that have I been forgiven have I been redeemed is this Blood more than enough I trust in your own mind that's been settled amen I really pray that that with all my heart and and and if it hasn't I pray this would be the service where we realize Jesus Paid It all and all to him I owe amen I was sin left its guilty stain but he made me white as snow Hallelujah I trust amen that's just how it is amen so Hallelujah so in the scriptures in the Old Testament I just like this one at the sin offering when they got two goats these goats Jesus represented both of them or they represented him rather one goat was killed the other was the sins of the Nations was placed I mean sin of the nation was placed upon this goat called the scapegoat and that goat had to go out into the Wilderness to die and to be out there alone among the beasts and so forth Jesus uh had to be that goat I want you to notice he was a lamb he was a sheep but he was made a goat for you and I praise God and we being a goat might become sheep we being Sinners guilty of death subject to death and all sold out under condemnation yet Christ became me that I through his grace might become him a Son of God seated at the right hand of God in Glory Hallelujah now amen but we know he didn't just do that but he rose triumphant over hell death in the grave amen so when he ascended and Mary was at the the tomb Jesus told her don't touch me cuz I've not ascended yet to my father and your father my God and your God Amen so he offered himself up up in glory came back down then he said to the his disciples touch me he even said to Thomas put your hand in my side in these things and yeah but now he's ascended and he is our high priest now God has always I put it this way he's always been the high priest of his word I mean he's always been alive to manifest his word in the lives of the Believers you see now because tied in with the with the with the scapegoat and with the high priest making an atonement was the Year of Jubilee so now carrying carrying the PE you know making atonement for the people now had an action in their lives yeah where it wasn't just I'm a forgiven and go back to my old life because those who were in slavery Who Sold themselves into slavery in in Israel when the atonement was made it wasn't just that their sins were atoned for but they could go back to their possession amen they go they could go back to the place they fell from amen so their inheritance that God had given them in the beginning they could return to and so now this is exactly what happens here when you know after seven sabbaths there's a 50-year jubilee you know I mean the 50th year is the Jubilee then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month this is the day of Aton at which is we just read about there in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man un his family amen so now there is a power tied with the atonement to restore everyone back to their possession that they fell from and to return every man unto his family now now we're not living in Israel we're not under the blood of bulls and goats right so this is not us returning to a pastle of ground as in a place in Palestine no but we have been returned back to our true land which is the word of God me back to the promises of God we're no longer worshiping under a denominational idea but we've come back to the full word of God we've come back to our inheritance amen because every promise of God Is Ours I mean so we have returned back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost so this was the power of Calvary now was not just to release us of our sins but to restore us back to what we fell from because we know when God thought of us before the foundation of the world he did not think of us as downtrodden brokenhearted uh under the Yoke of sin you know subject to sin nature defeated people he never thought of us that way he saw us in His image amen he saw us Made In His Image washed in his blood amen because we got to realize that before the evil ever ever was created by God Amen God made a way for for his people to be restored see before there was anything God was alone with his thoughts amen and he doesn't change his thinking like we do his when he thinks about something it's perfect amen it's perfect amen so when so when he thinks something and then he speaks it amen it's going to become material so his his thinking cannot change amen so if he loved you he loved you amen if he loved you he loved you amen he can't change change his love amen he cannot see now but we we think you know our love is a different kind of a love see the love of God is far greater than human love see human love is based on how you treat me I'll treat you you're good to me you scratch my back I'll scratch yours kind of thing you know you're good to me I'm good to you but God's love is far greater than that amen because remember when we were his enemy he loved us and died for us I mean when we were actually his enemy you know people who are not converted are actually fighting on the wrong team amen but when God comes their way they realize hey I'm actually on the wrong team here amen and they give their lives and then God Amen reveals to them who they really are that they are part of him amen so all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him now this is the Beast this is quite a big mouthful when you think about the multitude that he's talking about whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb sland from the foundation of the world and I just put this next verse I thought if any man have an ear let him here amen so so that's not all that's not phys IAL is that's spiritual hearing so if anyone has the spiritual ability to hear Let Them hear what the spirit is saying so everyone will dwell shall worship the Beast whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life which is I mean of the Lamb which is sland from the foundation of the world am mean so before there ever was anything created the lamb was slain in the mind of God Amen and he wrote your name in his blood on his book amen and now if he's written your name in heaven Amen in the Lamb's Book of Life your name can't be blotted out amen you it's impossible for it to be blotted out amen the devil don't have enough rubbing compound to get your name off that book Hallelujah now I'm not talking about the book of life I'm talking about the Lamb's Book of Life amen so now if our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life now we know a name represents a life you think of Moses you think about what he did Elijah what he did Jesus what he did Paul what he did because the name represent a life so now when our names were written down there God was thinking of a life amen now he's not thinking about our natural life amen remember he knew the character we have he knew he knew how short tall skinny round whatever whatever you know characteristics he he knew all those things and he pre-planned you'd be made exactly how you're made if you're noisy he wanted you noisy if you're quiet he wanted you quiet if you're in between somewhere he wanted you in the between I mean he made you how he wanted you to be made if he wanted you to be a different person he would have made you with a different personality amen so we just got to be comfortable on our own skin talking to myself a lot right now we just got to be happy thank you me I I remember was it Bible in schools at primary school we saying thank you Father for making me me you know and sometimes you get older you think uh yes thank you Lord you know but we God made us how he wanted us to be praise the Lord I'm glad you know CU God is a god of variety amen he's not a cookie cut of God that makes us all the same we don't have to conform to someone else's personality to be a Christian no we're got to be ourselves and God wants us to be ourselves amen cuz he CU he made you exactly how he wanted you to be made no but that's not just the part he was thinking about he's thinking of that part of himself he deposited in you before the foundation of the world Amen that when the word came your way you would recognize your name is in his book Hallelujah that that and now that's the god part amen that would come to life that seed that would come to expression am me when the Holy Ghost falls upon it amen so so so he thought of you before the devil was ever made amen he thought of you and made a way for you to overcome the devil before the devil ever became the devil I mean when when when Lucifer was actually not proud in his position doing what God made him to do the Lord had already made a way to overcome that guy amen hallelujah before amen so so now so if God has seen Us Victorious before amen time ever came or sin ever came into existence amen then nothing in time can stop what God has done in eternity amen nothing can stop amen doesn't matter the obstacles we face those are actually immaterial those don't matter amen we're not looking at obstacles we're looking at what God has done for us am mean that that is always the main factor in everything should be but God rich in Mercy amen but God rich in Mercy he's the one that matters he's the he's the change maker amen he's the Difference Maker is our God so before there was ever any evil any sin any pride in the heart of the devil before he ascended and you know did all he did the lamb was slam before the foundation of the world Amen so so before any Angels fell the lamb was slam before the foundation of the world and God put your name on his book amen hallelujah I think that's I think it's a wonderful thing amen I think yeah yeah I think it's a wonderful thing cuz when you realize that your name is written there in the Lamb's Book of Life you realize you didn't become a Believer haphazardly I mean you did not give your life to the Lord just just out of a it was circumstantial no it was beyond circumstance it was predestination am me when you receed the Holy Ghost you realize it wasn't just a it you know it wasn't a stab in the dark or wonder what's going to happen kind of think no you received the Holy Ghost because you are a son or daughter of God I mean as it says in the book of Galatians because you are Sons you receive the Holy Ghost so you know we don't become Sons by the new birth but because of the new birth we manifest who we really are amen hallelujah that makes me happy oh amen so now we can we can Rejoice this morning because we got to realize that whatever we're facing amen God already made a way to overcome it God already made a way to go through it amen Lord and so if we can if we can look into this now you know I like this I was just think about this phrase here in verse 9 but we're just going to read all this I mean I just love the book of Hebrews it puts God in his place it puts the devil in his place and it puts you in your place and I think that's good I'm glad I'm not in the devil's place this morning Hallelujah thou H has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him why because death is still here okay but we see Jesus I thought that's a real good that's a real good phrase you know whatever you're going through in life I trust no matter the problem the circumstances the questions the clouds of doubt and trouble he say but I see Jesus amen that he is working in my circumstances he's working in my trouble amen that should be the main thing but we see Jesus like the Apostle Paul's in the dungeon but saw Jesus amen he received the revelations of most of the New Testament you know he's there in the storm the boats going up and down they think they're all going to drown but he saw Jesus am amen why because he had Revelation that he's going to Rome and now we know we have Revelation we're going to glory amen amen but I trusted in every see the devil loves to Cloud things over amen but it doesn't matter how clouded it gets you got to realize that we have an anchor within the veil Christ Alone our Cornerstone I thought that's such a fitting song brother Isaac amen the songs we sung this morning amen that it doesn't matter how bad things get I trust you can say but I see Jesus he say I can't see him in the circumstance look beyond the circumstance amen God is in control who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he might by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became whom for whom are all things and by who by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the cap of their salvation perfect through sufferings both he that sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he not ashamed to call them Brethren amen sometimes we're ashamed to call ourselves you know we're ashamed of ourselves God's not ashamed of you amen praise the Lord he's not ashamed to say Yep they're part of my family they're part of me Hallelujah that doesn't mean we just wait off into sin and you know do all those things no we repent say Lord I want to be more like you change me Lord but you know he's not ashamed of us us amen he made a way amen for us to be made in His image now if we can just if we just really focus in on you know how how God does all things well you know he's not a distant God but he's here as I said now if he has if he has tasted death for every man so so so the S questions over now we also believe that the power is here to return us to our possession you know and I know I'm not preaching something that's foreign to any of us we've all experienced I trust this the saving grace of God that took you from the shackles of sin and death of unbelief and skepticism and all these things and raised us above those things I mean what's happening now a Liberation has come into your life and it wasn't you trying to break the shackles God came and broke the shackles I mean sure you've got to hate the sin that's captured you you've got to hate it I mean if you love anything of your old life chances are you'll turn back to it but if you hate that thing then God can break it off you completely Hallelujah so now so so so he's done this right so now if he started he's going to finish I mean so so a man in the Old Testament that was a slave when he heard that Jubilee trumpet he realized the atonements been made I can go back to my possession now he didn't just drop whatever Farm tool he was using and walk out of the field he didn't just walk out of the field and go down to the road no he walked all the way home it could have been a long journey back from his purchase but you know from his inheritance I don't know but the fact is the sound of that trumpet caused him to walk home amen and now we have heard the Jubilee trumpet the gospel trumpet amen where Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God right and so now faith has come into our lives and we realize that we do not belong in this culture we do not belong to be ruled by sin nature amen but God the power of the blood can take some nature out of our lives where once we used to wa made in sin and love the things of the world but now our appetites Changed by him that all we really want is him amen even if we're tempted there's something within us saying Lord lead me not into temptation Lord I don't want to do this thing change my nature Lord hallelujah so amen so so he went all the way back home amen because of the sound of that trumpet hallelujah hallelujah now hallelujah amen God is working in our lives amen I know we know that because you can say yes Lord you're working Jesus hallelujah amen so now but we got to realize that the love of God as I said before is not is not like human love it's not conditional love amen no but his love is shown in his calling his election yeah amen because you know it would ask in um you know uh Malachi Israel would ask in the Book of Malachi you know how do we know God loves us and he says well Jacob I've love and Esau you know have I hated so his love is shown in election in calling now you see they cannot figure F out God's love and many times this confuses us because you know we think that you know you know our you know God's love for us should be like a like a baby with parental care you know you don't want your children to go through anything okay some some parents let they're anyway no we don't want them to suffer harm we don't like it when they get hurt you know we want to keep them from those things and then and then when God allows us to go through trials and sickness and hardship we begin to question well where are you God I thought you loved me I thought you'd keep me from these things but no his love is not shown that way his love is shown by his election amen amen see see they thought see many people think that the love was like a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his God uh proof of his love is election no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that chosen under salvation because God ha chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul amen he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it's all with a purpose amen I pray that we could see the purpose of God in our lives am mean that we could see Lord you're doing something for a reason now he doesn't have to you know we don't have stand stand up meetings who's had a stand up meeting every day at work we're doing this today you know he doesn't NE sure we have a stand up well we have a kneel down meeting yo y pray to the Lord but he doesn't tell us everything we're going to go through in the day he's going to say now you're actually going to have lunch at this time and this is going to happen here and you're have a car crash here and you know all these sicknesses going to come here no he doesn't tell us those things amen right but we've got to just realize that Lord everything's for a purpose even the mundane of the Monday to Friday or whatever you you you know many times we just think we're just going through a cycle of a rinse and repeat kind of a life but God is working in that Hallelujah I'm glad he's working in our lives amen am amen but it's all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after you have suffered a while you may that um we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled Hallelujah I like that maybe I think I've used that quote quite a lot but you know I like that kind of thing you know after we've suffered a while we'll be made perfect be established what are we being established and that his word is true am mean that he loves us with an unfailing love that God is in control of Our Lives he you the Bible says that he puts in the hearts of men to fulfill his word and that's not even just talking about Christians that's actually everyone so people get upset at the government they're all getting already up in arms about the election now and of course in you know you know in America God will have who he wants in those offices right to fulfill his word you know people think they've got an agenda what they want to do no God has a plan amen and whatever God wants to do he's going to have it done am mean you say well then what is the point of us you know witnessing and and and and living for him and praying pray in these things because remember the model prayer was thy will be done on Earth as is is in heaven you know most of prayer should be Lord change my thinking to match your thinking that you that that I'd be at the right place at the right time say the right thing do the right thing to be a witness I mean because God wants an expression he must have an expression upon the Earth the devil sure has an expression in this day amen and we know God has an expression too amen he is living through his children Hallelujah he's living through you and I amen so we can trust you we can just have such confidence that whatever's going on right now God is in control God has allowed it that his word would be fulfilled amen and so we can press him with confidence saying Lord you're active in the Affairs of the world nothing's out of your control you're allowing things to happen so now Lord may we press in and and get every promise amen hallelujah why because he wants his purposes he wants to prove himself in your trouble amen amen his purpose if we can see his purpose in our lives like that praise God you mean Lord you've allowed this to happen that you can prove yourself absolutely praise God this is awesome thank you Lord I'm so glad you you want to prove yourself you don't want to prove my Humanity you want to prove your deity amen prove your word amen so I'm so thankful we can Hallelujah we can just say Lord prove yourself Show Yourself amen even even when it seems like the outcome is not the outcome we want Lord as long as your will is done am amen hallelujah hallelujah am brother we talk about when he was um watching Eagles and eaglets and so on he said about a big mama eagle takes the Eagles down to the green grassy Fields goes up into the mountains watches over her children and you know those babies are just having a great time on the grass cuz they've been in the nest the whole time stickers and and you know different you twigs and different things and you know there's mama up there watching and the babies are just down on the grass having a jubilee time like a real good Pentecostal meeting where God moves amen everything's wonderful Hallelujah and they're not worried at all because why every once in a while they look up and see Mama watching them amen that any predator that comes along amen they' going to deal with Mama amen it's the same thing with you and I any Devil comes along they've got Jesus Christ on their hands any sickness comes that's got Jesus Christ you know and I wouldn't want him on my hands you can't conquer him you can't defeat him you can't trick him you can't out with him I mean you out smart him he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and his word he has the final say Amen it ain't over till God says it's over amen so it ain't over till God says it's over amen so the devil says it's over but he don't know amen God knows all things that's right amen and old mother was sitting up there watching them I thought well praise be to God that's right he taken them out of the nest of the world he climbed up the ramp parts of Glory sitting on high watching over his Heritage to see that no harm comes what's that harm he's talking about the harm of the Soul yeah Hallelujah remember he will keep the faith you know Paul said I've kept the faith but what was keeping the faith in him God in him remember it's not if we hold on to Jesus that matters it's whether he holds on to us amen as long as I feel his big hand around mine I'll keep walking hallelujah amen praise the lord well praise be to God that's right amen I thought if a Cody would start towards one of those legals she' flog him to death I thought that's right let Satan take after a Believer he's got Jesus Christ on his hands amen that's right sickness comes into your life make it feel real unwelcome amen start to praise God trouble comes in I mean there's a there's a fussing spirit away from the house make it feel real unwelcome Worship the Lord love the Lord love one another a soft answer turns away wrath you know just just just make the devil feel real unwelcome yes sir hallelujah amen so remember now looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith my amen who is for the joy they will sit before him endure the cross despising the shame is sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen so he's the author and he's the finisher amen so now what he started so the one so so this is just the um definition of the author so he's the chief leader he's the one who takes the lead in anything and thus affords an example a predecessor in a matter a Pioneer now a Pioneer breaks new ground used to be Pioneers came here went to Canada different countries pioneer would go we don't really have any place to P maybe the moon they'd say if they go to Mars they're pioneering but you know we wanted to get to heaven not to a red planet anyway but you see our lord Jesus was a Pioneer cuz no one ever went into death and came out again amen conquering death amen hallelujah he you he he has gone on before everything we've gone through remember he conquered he conquered the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life right he conquered all those things amen and every sin falls under those categories I hope I've got got those three right amen so you see now he he is pioneered he has already led the way amen but he's also the finisher of our faith amen so the finisher is a completer amen it's to it's to finish it's to fulfill it's to make perfect amen so he doesn't just lead the way and Pioneer and start something but he finishes it am mean so if he saw you made in His image before the foundation of the world like he would say to job job where were you when I laid the foundations of the world and the sons of God the stars of God shouted Joy right God's trying to get job to say look job look beyond what you see with your eyes think beyond what you think with your mind and look to where you were in the beginning because remember he saw job rejoicing he didn't see job before the foundation of the world on an ash Heep am me that was a very temporal experience for job but God was trying to get him to see this is my eternal expression of who you are rejoicing praising me dancing Hallelujah free of this burden free of this sin free of trouble Hallelujah remember what you how you started is how you're going to finish hallelujah amen if you're in God's thinking you are you you made in His image washed in his blood redeemed right how you start how he thought of you is how you're going to be at the end as an expression amen hallelujah thank you my Lord amen Our God understands all trouble amen he understands all problems amen but you see now we got to have such confidence in him that he is more than able Amen to complete what he started who believes he started a work in now in your life amen if he started that work he's going to finish it h in spite of you and I and and I said about me in spite of me he's going to finish the work in spite of this guy you know praise the Lord hallelujah in spite of me he's going to do it amen so he's the author and finisher of our faith amen now it's interesting when you read Hebrews chapter 12 I'm we're not going to go through the whole thing but you come to the the end of the end of the chapter now this is not quite at the end of the chapter but now the beginning it says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher our faith or lay aside every weight and sin right that's the first verse that so easily besets us let's run this race with patience look under Jesus right and then you come down to the end of the chapter of Hebrews chapter 12 and then Paul's now saying we have not come to Mount Mount Si we're not come to the law but we have come to that New Jerusalem we've come to Mount Zion right we've come to we've come to this place amen now when you arriving somewhere you receive the benefits of that place amen right so if you want a tropical holiday and you arrive there you're going to enjoy the sunshine if you're here you won't get that I talk about what right but but when you arrive somewhere you enjoy the benefits of being there amen so now so now this is where the this is where um God is telling us this is where we have arrived amen now maybe maybe I I don't have all the verses so let's just go go to Hebrews 12 let's just read a little bit more of thisall Amen I I I trust you know it's like brother Ram says that you know my words will fail but his will never fail so let's just read his word amen amen so Hebrews chapter 12 and then we're going to go to let's just let's just read from verse um 18 because remember the book of Hebrews was a book of contrast the blood of Jesus is greater than the blood of bulls and goats Jesus Christ is a greater high priest than than anyone from the aric priesthood right you know all these contrasts and what the what the atonement does all these things you know it's far greater than what they have come out of he says but for you have not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burnt with fire nor unto the Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet the voice of Words which voice they heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they pardon me for they could not endure that which was commanded and for so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake he says you haven't come there but you have come unto Mount Zion amen unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an an an innumerable company of angels amen so there's more for us than against us today amen this is you we have come where where where Angels dwell Where Angels come and anoint our faith and join in our worship and amen bring us messages and so on to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven amen and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect amen so remember God is not just a judge that condemns but he's a judge that pardons amen Jesus dropped the charges case dismiss saved by grace amen amen so so he is judged just righteous Glory I'm glad he has amen do you believe that this morning amen he has judged us right and then even the Bible says when we are not faithful yet he remaineth faithful amen so he is a faithful high priest amen am mean so so he has judged Us by the blood of Jesus Christ he has judged us righteous and say now notice is it doesn't say to men made perfect it says to the spirits of just men made perfect CU these bodies will not be made perfect until they're changed right but by the blood of Jesus Christ he makes our souls sinless amen he makes our spirit's perfect he cleanses them out and that's why we need the washing of the water of the word the devil tries to put things in our Spirits complexes pains or just things you know but then the word washes those things from us you know you come in these doors and you feel troubled and laiden down and whatever more but then you walk out feeling light and happy what's happened you've just been washed and You Begin sing the songs of Zion your mind is all over the place and you sing the songs that Amen to that then God begins to wash all those troubles away amen amen it says now and to Jes Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen so the so so this is who we've come to we haven't come to a natural man who's a high priest but we've come to Jesus Christ who's the mediator of the New Covenant amen he says that the that his blood speaketh better things than that of Abel amen so notice speaketh as in a presentent speaking it's not a past like it spoke it's speaking amen amen so so his blood is speaking amen now that blood is doing far more for us than we realize yeah brother Braham said I don't have the quote he said you know if God just took his hand off me just for a little bit I'd be in big trouble so I'm sure we're all thankful of God's protection in our lives keeping us amen because without him we could never stand we could never survive this age we'd never overcome without him amen but with him we can do all things amen we can overcome all trouble Hallelujah I'm so thankful for that amen amen so this so mediator as a go between amen I think it was Joby said I wish there was a man or you know that you know that could basically be a bridge between between God and man amen and then we know our lord Jesus is that mediator he's our goet amen he's our reconciler I'm so glad we're reconciled I trust you're not an enemy to God today you've given your life to him you've been you know washed in his blood filled with the Holy Ghost amen so you've been reconciled to God Amen he's our intercessor our mediator so like the Bible says there's one mediator between God and man that's the man Christ Jesus it's not Mary not some Pope not some dead Saint somewhere but there's one mediator between God and man am mean and now that speaketh is is is an action word it's a verb now to talk to utter words to preach I mean to tell to utter I mean so so his blood speaks on our behalf now it says here now it speaks better things than that of Abel because Abel's blood could never speak Redemption Abel's blood could never speak freedom it could never give a jubilee his blood amen but his blood could only cry out as God would say to Cain the blood of your brother cries out from the earth I mean so all could cry out was I've been wronged you know someone's got to make this right I've been murdered my life's been taken from me amen but Jesus said no man taketh my life I lay it down and I'll raise it back up again amen he freely gave his life for you and I Hallelujah so now so now his blood doesn't cry out revenge or to settle scores like Abel's blood did but his blood Cries Out amen it cries out Redemption amen it cries out amen redeemed hallelujah amen amen you see now see in the Old Testament sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt amen speaking about Abel's blood in the New Testament it spoke of redemption in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven and that same blood that was shed on the um upon the ground that called out after his dead brother or called out after his dead brother that killed him the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks oh my hallelujah amen see Abel was a righteous man died he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real Revelation he had he spoke it he cried out the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed amen it speaketh better things see it makes you sons and daughters that hide you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel could not hide Cain but the but the blood of Jesus can amen amen hallelujah so so the blood still cries Freedom as Brother Andy sings amen so the blood still cries freedom and it's still crying Freedom right now hallelujah it's just as powerful as it was when it was on Calvary I may be just you may think this is very Elementary but I'm blessed by these things I'm so thankful we have a God that cares a God that stands in the Gap amen when we feel that all hell is against us he's standing for us amen he's the one who's our shield and our guide and our protector amen he's the one who who because the devil is the accuser of the Brethren and he goes up before God because he's allowed to and he stands there and accuses he you know he puts your name and accuses what you have done before God and says God they did this they sinned here they lied here they did this wrong they did this wrong because he's trying to get a hold to say he's still got claims on you amen but the Lord says no but my blood my blood has cleansed them my blood is made them whole amen that's not a lot of them cuz my blood has taken it far away amen you may accuse but my blood is more than enough Hallelujah that's what his blood does for us even now that's why we need an intercessor that's why we need a mediator amen we need these things amen until these bodies are changed we're taken off the Earth cuz we're still in these amen these mortal bodies Hallelujah but remember now part of the part of the atonement was that the people will return to their possession amen so we we are returning back to our position in Christ I believe we already really are there amen if we realize what God has already made us amen we can stand because remember now the devil can attack our bodies with sickness that doesn't take our salvation right the devil can attack our minds with mind battles and troubles and complexes that doesn't change our Salvation right so you can be the sickest person in the world with the biggest complexes in the spirit but if God has met you and sealed you into the kingdom amen you've got Victory H you know you've got Victory see the devil can attack your body he can attack your spirit but he can't touch that Soul amen that's the Soul's the most precious thing amen if that's been sealed by the Holy Ghost amen covered in the blood it doesn't matter what happens to the body doesn't matter what happens to the spirit you are secure eternally Hallelujah I'm so glad that God watches over his word amen he watches over his people amen hallelujah he is now the high priest of his own word amen hallelujah he says now he came down let's just start with this I just love this amen where he says but there was no man on Earth could do the job speaking of the state that Adam's Fallen race was in we're all as worldly speaking in the same boat we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to world speaking lies and none of us could help each other we stood helpless defeated Chaos on every hand all ununited we can not keep the laws and ceremonies finding their weaknesses and so forth we could not do it and it seemed like the whole human race was laid waste sometimes we can look at it now we're on chaos is on every hand you know trouble in the world but no there's a Difference Maker comes on the scene then he came he came down amen because he was in the beginning the Bible said he was the word he was the logos that went out of God and the logos in the beginning was the word and he became the word then when he ascended on high on that glorious day of Easter he became not only the word but he became the high priest of his own word am me oh what a glorious thing brother nil just think he's not only the word but he is the high priest of his own word how could we doubt it how could we walk to him and not believe that we receive what we ask for for he is the word and the intercessor of the word the logos became word and the word became flesh and the same flesh that was the word received up into Glory now is the high priest making intercession by himself to his word now you think about in the Old Testament where Solomon do you think of the power of you know God God um undertaking to fulfill a Word of Promise now here is Solomon I know it's just a drawing of but but this is just a you know when Solomon dedicated the temple he said Lord if anyone look towards this Temple and pray may you hear from heaven then God came down filled the place with his glory and basically basically he's saying Amen to the temple he came and dwelt in it and he's saying Amen to Solomon's Prayer now here was a he was a natural King praying that God would God would Undertake and we know that Jonah now now there's many more than just Jonah but you know Jonah Jonah was in the belly of a whale and he remembered Solomon's Prayer amen that's right and so here he is he says but he says yet I'm cast out of the sight yet I'll look again to toward thy Holy Temple now we know he physically didn't know where he was but by faith he could look amen so so God now heard heard his prayer because he had confidence in the prayer of a natural King that God would answer that prayer amen he says here now I went down to the bottoms of the of the mountains the Earth where their bars was about me forever yet thou Hast brought up my life from corruption oh Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine Holy Temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy but I'll sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I'll pay it that I have vowed salvation as of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish and vomited out Jonah upon the dry land Hallelujah so Jonah was in whales belly and he praised God but he had confidence that God would hear his prayer because God heard the prayer of Solomon amen now amen you know our lord Jesus has prayed for us now now Jonah had confidence in Solomon's Prayer now how much now you just read all of John 17 I've just taken out a few scriptures just to put on a slide okay but now this whole chapter is a prayer he says I've given given them Thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I'm not of the world I pray that thou should not should us not keep them um sorry I pray that thou should us take wow I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but thou should us keep them from the evil I hope I got that the fifth time okay they are not of the world even as I am not of the world neither do I pray these for these alone so I've just dropped down a few verses neither do I pray these for the neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word amen that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world May believe that thou Hast sent me and the glory which thou Gest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one so he's not just praying for the disciples my Lord that they would be kept from the evil that'd be in the but he's praying for you and I why because we have believed on the Lord through their word amen amen so you go read that John 17 you realize actually this is not the prayers of Solomon now this is not a king who would be sure the wisest man but would backslide and fall and all these things but this was a greater than Solomon is here right this was the king of glory made flesh interceded for us upon the Earth and prayed for us that we'd be kept from the evil what is that evil that is unbelief is the greatest evil there is sin is just an attribute you know I mean all the things you see is just attributes of unbelief you see around you in the world so the Lord actually prayed for us that we'd be kept from these things amen don't you think God can don't you think that he can be the high priest of his own prayer am mean to keep you in this world I may be condensing it down very Elementary but you know do we have confidence no no I'm talking about myself now cuz you see you know things in life and yourself and Lord how can this ever be and how's it ever how we ever going to get through this but when you sit back and you realize he found me he made a way before the enemy was ever here nothing can stop him nothing could stop him redeeming us on Calvary hell couldn't stop him ascending amen right sin couldn't stop him nothing could stop stop him he rose triumphant forever more he's now the high priest of our profession he's been working down through seven Church ages and he's still alive today nothing can stop him now amen hallelujah so many things we say Lord how's this ever going to happen but we just got to Lord maybe we just have greater confidence in you Lord that's my prayer this morning amen that that because this prayer that is that we would be one as as as here saying that him and his father were one remember and the father that he said it's not me that doeth the works but the father that dwelleth me doth the works right so that Oneness that he had was with the Holy Ghost was within him in the fullness right and God was manifesting himself through Jesus Christ is that okay if I put it that way amen so now that was the prayer that that would happen and so now if you've received the Holy Ghost you you can actually say I am the answer to Jesus prayer praise the Lord hallelujah is that all right amen so now so we can have such confidence I believe this morning now Jonah wasn't the only one I'm just going to use another for example Jehoshaphat in 2 Chronicles was in a big trouble the enemies came against them he couldn't win he assembled um it was it was Jerusalem and and and Judah and they went into the new court there by the temple and they called unto God because they believed that God would answer Solomon's Prayer that's why they went to the temple to call upon God when they're calling upon God God came down and prophesied through a man and said what to do now there's more inst there's more things than just that but I'm saying if God can answer Solomon's Prayer can he answer his own prayer for your life you know some people think well no one's ever prayed for me Jesus already has and now he is the high priest of his own word amen and what that means is is is he is here now to cause his word to come to pass Hallelujah so I'm just going to wrap up with this because I've gone over time I'm just going to leave you with this thought now in Hebrews Hebrews 13 we find this it's called here the Everlasting Covenant God had a covenant with them but the blood now is an Everlasting Covenant the blood of Jesus Christ God's bloodbound promises make makes us free from sin and self makes us free from anything of the world no matter how much we try to Fashion it the world it's all dead for in God's bloodbound promises we see nothing but the blood how could you look out that door without seeing the blood now this is talking about in the Old Testament with the first Exodus they put the blood on the door and L right so how could you look out the door then without seeing the blood now how can you look out at anything without first seeing the blood of Jesus Christ amen so I trust when we look at everything in life we see the blood first amen so when we look at our family we see the blood we don't see what they're doing we we see the blood amen we see the blood atoning for them we see the blood interceding for them we see the blood bringing them home all the blood amen when you look at sickness I trust you don't see the sickness you see the blood before the sickness I mean that God is already by his Stripes They're healed amen I trust that's how you look amen when you see people on the street you never look down your nose at anyone you know but you see them through the blood amen well then well what does that mean you say well the blood that atone for you Lord you save me you can save anyone Lord doesn't matter where they're coming out of how deep they are in sin whatever they're trying to do what the devil's doing to them Legion had a legion of demons in him but Jesus looked through at him through you could say his own blood and S A Son of God that needed to be redeemed amen so I pray we can look at everything that way amen that we and then and then when we look at the promises of God and his word we're looking through the blood of the promise amen amen so so to me that means that now God purchased that promise that'll be manifested in our lives hallelujah amen thank Hallelujah I trust I trust that's how we see things this morning amen that we we look at every situation through the blood God is per purposed it there's a reason for it Lord show yourself to me in it Lord even if you may be silent Lord I know you're working in my life because you're actively interceding leading me protecting me guiding me through life's journey I think really when we get to the other side and we see our lives replayed we'll be shocked at how much God was in our lives sometimes I think we just see him this much like he answered my prayer here and he did this here but we don't realize he's there the whole time I know what's going on with this can we just I'm getting fizzed at you know but if we could just really realize God is in every situation doesn't matter if you feel it you don't feel it if you feel happy sad mad or glad whatever it is frustrated God's right there but if we can look at it just realize Lord you've never I've never been alone amen you've always been my helper and my guide and Lord may we just trust you more Lord that's just my prayer this morning amen let's have the musicians please am mean but he is a faithful and merciful high priest and because he was a man he understands the Frailty of humanity he understands what we go through maybe that's a whole another subject maybe next Sunday I think I've been saying that a bit too much but you know let's stand shall we amen and let's um let's sing again that song Christ Alone Cornerstone weak made strong amen amen let's just Worship the Lord this morning Hallelujah I'm so glad he's mindful of us you know brother R tells a story of um I can't remember what king it was of England or queen but you know when they went through Canada and of course you know Canada is a you know Commonwealth country like us and you know all the schools went out there had little flags all the school kids and everything as the king went past whatever and and then once the parade was all said and done the kids went back to school you know the um you know one of the kids was missing when the role was called they went searching for a roundabout and they found behind a lampost crying and um and they said you know what's wrong what's happened are you hurt she said no I'm not hurt what's happened to you I said well I mean did you see the king did you wave your flag said yes then why are you upset and she's saying well but did the king see me and many times we waving our flag we're worshiping we're praising God and we get upset sometimes does the king really see us does the Lord Of Glory see us he sees us he never misses anyone no amen we're never out of his care amen so let's um let's sing this brother Isaac amen let's Worship the Lord this
