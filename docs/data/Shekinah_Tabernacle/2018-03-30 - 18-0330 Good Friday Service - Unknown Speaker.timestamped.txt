[38:04] you're gonna read a few scriptures that
[38:10] just a family we're gonna just speak a
[38:14] bit before we go into the communion I
[38:22] mean it what a wonderful time to be a
[38:24] Christian when I read from verse 12 of
[38:28] Colossians chapter one sees here giving
[38:34] thanks unto the father who has made us
[38:37] meet to be partakers of the inheritance
[38:39] of the saints and light who hath
[38:41] delivered us from the power of darkness
[38:43] and hath translated us into the kingdom
[38:45] of his dear son and whom we have
[38:48] redemption through his blood even the
[38:50] forgiveness of sins it was the image of
[38:53] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[38:54] creature for by him we're all things
[38:56] created that are that are in heaven and
[38:59] that are on earth visible and invisible
[39:00] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[39:03] principalities or powers all things were
[39:05] created by him and for him and he is
[39:08] before all things and by him all things
[39:10] consist and he is the head of the body
[39:13] the church which is the beginning the
[39:15] firstborn from the dead that in all
[39:17] things he might have the preeminence for
[39:19] it pleased the father that in him should
[39:23] all fullness dwell and having made peace
[39:25] through the blood of his cross by him to
[39:27] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[39:30] I say whether they be things and earth
[39:32] or things in heaven and you that were
[39:35] sometimes
[39:35] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[39:38] work by wicked works yet now hath he
[39:41] reconciled and we're just gonna read the
[39:43] next verse a lot and the body of his
[39:45] flesh through death to present you holy
[39:47] and unblameable and Unruh prover ball in
[39:51] his sight hallelujah may the Lord bless
[39:53] his word you may have your seats add
[39:56] this evening I mean I'd like to what do
[40:03] we know her brother Branham took this
[40:06] portion of Scripture and he preached
[40:07] there
[40:07] the mystery of God revealed and I'd like
[40:10] to take just a small thought out of that
[40:13] message where you know it's so
[40:15] tremendous when you see the power of the
[40:18] power of the blood that takes a people
[40:21] that were that were and in the devil's
[40:24] pawn shoppers brother Brown says you
[40:25] know we were we were slaves to him
[40:28] we were under his mastery where he where
[40:31] it says in Ephesians chapter two that we
[40:33] once walked according to the Prince of
[40:35] the power of the year but he but we but
[40:37] our Lord has quickened us made us alive
[40:40] I remember once we were slaves to the
[40:43] enemy we're a slaves to our sin nature
[40:45] amen when we could not help ourselves we
[40:48] could not it
[40:49] no man can improve himself can change
[40:52] his nature you know there's that you're
[40:53] the bookstores are full of self-help
[40:55] books but you cannot change the nature
[40:57] of man by your own ability we were all
[41:00] in a prison we were all lost and undone
[41:02] but God Richard mercy he knew where his
[41:06] people were he knew the H they would be
[41:09] manifested in he knew the the country
[41:12] they were from in you the appearance he
[41:13] knew their culture they'd be raised him
[41:15] he knew what the enemy would try and put
[41:17] down their throats and what kind of
[41:19] complexes and and things that they
[41:22] wouldn't hear it from their forebears he
[41:24] knew all about that but yet in spite of
[41:26] all those things that didn't bother him
[41:28] one but hallelujah he didn't needn't
[41:30] worry how much the enemy thought he had
[41:33] is hold on someone God didn't get all
[41:35] panicky and worried how am I going to
[41:37] deliver this one I mean because he knew
[41:40] holy that has his blood his word his
[41:43] bleeding word was more than enough to
[41:45] take her people and wash them and
[41:47] transform them hallelujah and give them
[41:50] his nature hallelujah our God was not
[41:53] you know he's not worried what situation
[41:56] we found ourselves in I mean whatever
[41:58] our first birth produced in our lives he
[42:01] wasn't too worried about it
[42:02] because he knew his transforming power
[42:04] ami could take that person and make them
[42:07] into a new creature we are not a patched
[42:09] up people and then we're not just a this
[42:12] is not a Reformation this is a
[42:14] transformation holy we're not a reformed
[42:17] people were being transformed I mean by
[42:19] this endtime message
[42:21] hallelujah we are a new creation in
[42:24] Christ I mean just like he would take he
[42:27] would speak to Abraham now now Abraham
[42:29] was was Evren before God changed his
[42:31] name and and that and that H you know he
[42:34] put in Abraham's name if you go into the
[42:36] Hebrew that's like the breath of God and
[42:38] he breathed into them and he bred Sarah
[42:40] as well he put the Acer huh in the in
[42:43] their names
[42:44] that's God's breath coming into them
[42:46] making them a new creation holy just
[42:50] like Adam the pinnacle of pinnacle of um
[42:52] you know God's creation was now a man in
[42:55] a body and when when God formed that
[42:57] body and he put the spirit man into that
[42:59] body it says he breathes into him and he
[43:02] became a living soul hallelujah
[43:04] it's a God breathed on Adam and him he
[43:07] came alive in this flesh body and and he
[43:10] breathed on him because he because he
[43:12] wanted him to become God over the earth
[43:13] I mean so a breeze on his people is
[43:16] God's Spirit goes into them hallelujah
[43:19] for them to manifest a portion of his
[43:22] word holy just like Abraham I mean he
[43:26] was he was mmm and he did a lot of
[43:28] things in his flesh he had Ishmael he
[43:31] did a lot of different things but then
[43:33] when his name was changed after God
[43:35] breathed on him I mean it you know it's
[43:37] a type of the Holy Ghost coming into a
[43:39] person I mean and now when God is
[43:41] speaking now to Abraham he says take thy
[43:44] son thine only son Isaac take him up the
[43:48] mountain now we would look in our carnal
[43:52] minds and say what about us well he was
[43:54] his son as well but that was the
[43:56] creature Abraham's son that was not
[43:58] Abraham son
[43:59] you understand so so everything that
[44:01] Abraham did was not attributed to
[44:03] Abraham I mean because he was a new
[44:06] creature in Christ hallelujah as a type
[44:08] hallelujah though yiddishe momme was
[44:11] walking upon the earth and doing all
[44:12] different kinds of things when God
[44:14] looked down at Abraham he was a need and
[44:16] bringing to Abraham's life and he it
[44:19] wasn't allotted to him hallelujah
[44:21] Edison was same with the Bride of Christ
[44:23] we may have done a lot of things under
[44:25] our first birth I mean we made that a
[44:28] lot of things we're not pleased with the
[44:29] proud over even remotely and may man
[44:32] your might even make
[44:33] shudder to think we used to do those
[44:35] things but when God looks at you after
[44:37] than your birth I mean those things are
[44:39] attributed to you I mean you're a new
[44:41] creature you're a new creature in Christ
[44:43] Jesus hallelujah
[44:45] I mean this is what Easter means to me
[44:47] hallelujah I did a lot of bad things for
[44:50] 20-odd years minute most of it pretty
[44:53] much all what I'm not proud of I mean
[44:55] one day God came this message came my
[44:58] way and Jesus Christ became a living
[45:00] reality
[45:00] hallelujah made me a new creature
[45:03] hallelujah that's why you're the devil
[45:06] as I said he's not a good historian
[45:08] because they only come so far the only
[45:09] tells you of the bad part of your past
[45:11] but he never tells you at the time that
[45:13] he was he was cast out of you I mean
[45:16] when Jesus Christ took the throne of
[45:17] your heart I mean in Satan was despised
[45:20] and he was cast out and he was defeated
[45:22] holily and then when he came back he was
[45:24] defeated again hallelujah this devil
[45:27] does not remind you of those things
[45:28] because he does not like that kind of
[45:30] history but he remembers those days
[45:32] hallelujah amen so now our Lord Jesus is
[45:37] the head of the body the church
[45:39] hallelujah now he's speaking of a multi
[45:41] a mini membered body that have come out
[45:45] of every kindred nation and tongue
[45:47] hallelujah this is his body now so but
[45:50] in order to take this body he has to pay
[45:54] a price to redeem this body hallelujah
[45:57] so now he goes to Calvary he pays a
[46:00] price because he has in his mind I've
[46:02] got a people I've got a wife I need to
[46:04] redeem and I'm not and I'm not happy at
[46:07] all that she is under the bonds of Satan
[46:10] I do not want her I mean being caught
[46:13] between me and him I want to break that
[46:15] I want to break that chain I mean
[46:18] completely that these people aren't and
[46:19] under heavily under his influence and
[46:22] under my influence I don't want that
[46:24] kind of a bride
[46:25] I want a bride that loves me I want to
[46:28] bribe that all her hardest to serve me
[46:30] hallelujah that she's not interested in
[46:32] the devil and anything that he can try
[46:34] and wave in front of her face I'm in
[46:36] bitter hardest completely turned to my
[46:38] word I mean that loves me above all
[46:40] things hallelujah this is the kind of
[46:43] body that he wants that a a body that is
[46:46] completely
[46:47] longing a hundred percent to him
[46:49] hallelujah remember remember our Lord
[46:52] Jesus when he purchased your Redemption
[46:54] he didn't have to pay interest off I
[46:56] mean there wasn't more repayments that
[46:58] he had to pay hallelujah you're not
[47:00] mortgaged out whoever it is he paid the
[47:02] price in full
[47:03] he wants a full Redemption he will not
[47:07] rest until there is a full redemption of
[47:09] his bride hallelujah that is his purpose
[47:11] I mean that is the reason that that he
[47:14] would have preeminence over a people as
[47:16] that they would love him with everything
[47:18] that they are Amen that they are hers as
[47:21] this Bible says in another place we are
[47:24] the purchased possession hallelujah now
[47:27] if something fully belongs to you you
[47:30] don't have to pay someone else a bit
[47:31] more to get it I mean it's like those
[47:34] who maybe have bought a house you're
[47:35] still paying off your mortgage that is
[47:37] not completely yours
[47:38] I mean situations could change the bank
[47:41] and come and take your house away
[47:42] because not fully yours but the Lord
[47:45] Jesus did didn't do that Amen if there's
[47:48] a mortgage he's still paying off the
[47:49] filing will become as purchased
[47:51] possession that is not as purpose when
[47:53] he hung there between heavens and earth
[47:55] and said it is finished I mean he was
[47:57] declaring I painted and full I mean I
[47:59] paid the full price of redemption
[48:01] hallelujah now for the next two thousand
[48:03] years he's been enforcing that
[48:05] Redemption Amen down on through that he
[48:08] would take her people through seven
[48:09] Church ages Amen and he would manifest
[48:11] himself to those people and they they
[48:14] would manifest the word for their age
[48:16] hallelujah like Luther manifested the
[48:18] word for his age Wesley manifested the
[48:21] word for his age Pentecost their age but
[48:23] now that now it's a bright age holy the
[48:26] Prophet tells us we're living in a
[48:27] bright age Amen where there's a people
[48:30] he speaks about the bride coming of
[48:32] Jesus Christ and I trust you don't choke
[48:34] on that because even the Bible says that
[48:36] any spirit that says Jesus Christ has
[48:39] not is not in flesh as Antichrist not
[48:43] not has come past it but it's coming
[48:45] flesh you go read the scripture anyone
[48:47] that says that Jesus has not come in the
[48:50] flesh as Antichrist so that's not saying
[48:53] oh yeah because many people say yes he
[48:55] came 2,000 years ago he was there he's
[48:57] our lamb he's our Redeemer
[48:59] he was there manifested the man of God
[49:01] olia now he yo he died for our sins and
[49:03] he rose again forevermore I guess he was
[49:05] there but then when you say Jesus and me
[49:08] feels they hold up what do you mean a a
[49:11] bride coming well there was a bride
[49:14] coming on the day of Pentecost when the
[49:16] bride 120 members of the bride were in
[49:18] the upper room and the same Jesus Christ
[49:20] in a different form came in 12th and his
[49:22] bride hallelujah there was a bride
[49:24] coming there so it's not a there's
[49:26] nothing new it's been happening down
[49:27] through 7 Church ages but now we're
[49:29] manifesting the fullness of the word and
[49:32] then we're Pentecost had a part Luther
[49:34] had a part Wesley had a part now the
[49:36] entire you know scripture has come open
[49:38] then we're not men if we're not
[49:40] manifesting part of Jesus but all of him
[49:43] amen and that's why brother I said now
[49:46] we're in a bride age because our Lord
[49:48] Jesus he's in Revelations 3 he's been
[49:50] kicked out of the church world so he's
[49:52] got to find a place to manifest so he
[49:54] calls a bride out hallelujah he comes
[49:56] and dwells and those people he manifests
[49:58] were through those people I mean what a
[50:00] tremendous thing where we are not we are
[50:02] not shackled up to any organized
[50:04] organization of man and then we have no
[50:07] headquarters upon this earth how
[50:09] headquarters is in heaven
[50:10] hallelujah we'd have to report to some
[50:12] man upon this earth we report to this
[50:14] man Christ Jesus in heaven hallelujah
[50:18] and he's here to take control
[50:19] amen of his people hallelujah so we
[50:23] don't belong to the devil we do not
[50:24] belong to this world I mean I'm not
[50:26] accountable to the devil I'm not
[50:29] accountable to this world I mean to this
[50:31] world I'm accountable to Jesus Christ
[50:33] the word hallelujah I mean there's
[50:36] nothing holding me here I'm a free I'm a
[50:39] free man I mean I'm not a slave I'm a
[50:42] free man
[50:43] hallelujah recognize yourself free are
[50:46] you following me Jesus comes he breaks
[50:49] every chain
[50:50] he breaks every hold the devil has he
[50:53] may be in a little toe hole that a whole
[50:54] kinds of things Jesus comes and cuts it
[50:56] all he says this belongs to me I'll take
[50:59] all the hooks out of them I mean they
[51:02] have no claim
[51:03] I meant how glad it is we had a man our
[51:05] Lord Jesus many prophets have done
[51:08] incredible things but he's the only one
[51:10] who see it I lay my life down I'll pick
[51:12] it back up again
[51:13] I lay my life down I'll put him back up
[51:15] again and he picked us life back up
[51:17] again hallelujah he came out of the tomb
[51:20] and then but then they came now 2,000
[51:24] years but now now came a time and maybe
[51:27] I'm jumping here to myself but he but he
[51:29] becomes a time in the book of Revelation
[51:32] when he's a sealed title deed to the
[51:34] earth the book of redemption in the
[51:36] right hand of the original creator and
[51:38] there's a and the strong angel says
[51:40] hurts worthy to take the book and John
[51:42] was weeping because he saw no man was
[51:44] found to be worthy
[51:45] Allu you and he wept much because in you
[51:48] unless a man was found they could take
[51:51] this title deed to the earth I mean all
[51:53] of creation was lost
[51:55] hallelujah and then he wept much and and
[51:59] and John was the one that laid on Jesus
[52:01] bosom he was the Beloved Disciple and he
[52:04] was weeping because he couldn't see
[52:06] Jesus and then one of the elders here's
[52:08] weep not John it's okay there's a man
[52:10] holy is a man that's been found worthy
[52:13] is the man that's been found worthy to
[52:15] step on your behalf when you could not
[52:18] be redeemed there was one who could
[52:19] redeem you and then he saw the Lamb
[52:22] coming forth out of eternity hallelujah
[52:25] and he was found worthy he took the book
[52:27] hallelujah said this is now my
[52:29] possession hallelujah because you're
[52:31] part of that book
[52:32] I mean you plant your names are in the
[52:34] book hallelujah and he looses the seals
[52:36] and now he says I'm going to tell you
[52:38] what your inheritance says hallelujah
[52:41] amen if there was not a man worthy found
[52:44] not a man worthy to take that book of
[52:46] title I mean we would still be stuck and
[52:49] time would continue to go on but there
[52:52] was a man hallelujah his name is the
[52:55] Lord Jesus Christ he was found worthy
[52:58] it's covered in his own blood he had
[53:01] wrestled he prevailed hallelujah amen
[53:05] and he's doing all this doing all this
[53:07] because he wants his body hallelujah
[53:11] I mean it's like you see the cloud on
[53:13] Sunset Mountain that's the hedgy you
[53:15] know Jesus told brother Brent in the
[53:16] picture to the right it's the hoffmans
[53:18] head of Christ right there it's the head
[53:21] that's looking for the body he following
[53:23] me it's the head chippers here the
[53:25] Prophet says
[53:26] headship is here more than a cloud
[53:27] Christ himself hallelujah we're not a
[53:30] headless body I mean we're not a
[53:33] headless body a ministry is coming this
[53:35] in time to unite Christ and the people
[53:37] together I mean just like John the
[53:39] Baptist he pointed out the Lamb of God
[53:41] to the people hallelujah
[53:43] that was his ministry I'm going to
[53:45] introduce you people to the lamb and
[53:47] then he comes as seeking cuz enough to
[53:49] the flesh he says behold the Lamb of God
[53:52] that takes away the sin of the world and
[53:53] he introduced Jesus Christ to the people
[53:55] I mean he says I must decrease he must
[53:57] increase
[53:58] Kolia cuz he was it introduced a many
[54:02] said I'm the friend of the bridegroom
[54:03] hallelujah I'm here to conduct the
[54:06] wedding hallelujah amen you know you
[54:09] know if a man and a woman are married
[54:11] legally Amen you could say they're each
[54:14] other's property amen it's just like my
[54:19] wife no other man has claims on her and
[54:21] no other woman has claims on me by
[54:23] cerveza she belongs to me I belong to
[54:26] her hallelujah amen legally letter so
[54:30] hallelujah and you just times that by 10
[54:33] billion billions and that's how our Lord
[54:35] Jesus is I mean my my bride is mine and
[54:39] I am hers and and nothing else is
[54:43] allowed to touch her I mean give her a
[54:46] run belief to file her anyway
[54:48] because legally I've purchased her
[54:50] redemption I mean I'm going to force
[54:52] that redemption Holly that where I am
[54:54] she is all sorry hallelujah we have a
[54:57] lot to be thankful for
[54:59] I mean I don't belong to the devil I
[55:01] trust you've come to that realization to
[55:03] I'm not the devil's property I'm the
[55:05] Lord Jesus amen I'm his and he is mine
[55:10] hallelujah hallelujah he sees this
[55:15] Christ says from Christ a mystery God
[55:17] reveals he sees but she the bride is
[55:20] identified by him has he identified you
[55:24] as yet supernaturally identified you I
[55:28] mean because it's one thing I want to be
[55:30] identified with him just like we're
[55:32] going to take the communion here this is
[55:34] us giving a public testimony I've become
[55:37] one with my lamb
[55:39] I meant but it's one thing to identify
[55:41] yourself with him but when he comes
[55:43] identifies himself with you that's what
[55:46] counts
[55:46] when he receives your faith hallelujah
[55:50] that's the main thing hallelujah amen
[55:54] I'd be rejoicing I mean if he's received
[55:57] your faith if he's identified if he
[56:00] looks at you and says I'm proud to be
[56:02] identified with these people I'm proud
[56:05] to say I'm one of them colorful ouya I
[56:07] mean our Lord is not ashamed of us he's
[56:10] proud this is my bride hallelujah he
[56:13] actually shows you off there's like joke
[56:16] Satan comes up before God and of course
[56:19] God knows where he is but God always
[56:21] comes down to everyone's level and so
[56:23] God says to Satan where have you been
[56:25] he says I've been walking to and fro and
[56:27] now God send me a say I want to show off
[56:29] one of my children have you considered
[56:31] my servant job he's perfect man he's a
[56:33] perfect man there's no one like him at
[56:35] all the earth and and no doubt Satan's
[56:38] kind of scratching his head because he
[56:39] probably seen joke he thought well
[56:41] there's nothing too special about him
[56:42] he's like anyone else but that's got
[56:44] that Satan looking I mean but when God
[56:47] looks down when he when he looked down
[56:48] at Jobe a man under the blood of bulls
[56:50] and goats he's a perfect man there is
[56:52] none like him see he's showing showing
[56:54] off job to the devil
[56:55] this man's incredible holier he loves me
[56:58] I mean in spite of everything amen and
[57:01] then and then you know the devil say I'm
[57:04] God does the same thing with you have
[57:07] you considered my little bride there was
[57:10] no one like her Amen in all ages there's
[57:14] never been a people like this people
[57:16] will all be in heaven you understand me
[57:18] but this is the darkest age this is the
[57:21] most deceptive age this is the most
[57:23] religious age I mean there's millions of
[57:25] voices upon the earth you could spend
[57:27] million I don't know how many lifetimes
[57:29] on YouTube trying to find the truth and
[57:31] good luck trying to go through all that
[57:34] myriad of opinion it's the most
[57:36] deceptive age but yet God put you in
[57:39] this age and he's telling Satan look
[57:42] here's my bride here's my elected ones
[57:44] that I've been waiting for to manifest
[57:46] me and my fullness
[57:48] hallelujah we're a
[57:50] a people that we made in my image
[57:53] hallelujah he tells he tell Satan about
[57:56] you hallelujah
[57:58] oh because he as God is proud of you we
[58:04] may not think too much about ourselves
[58:05] we're gonna change our thinking Lord
[58:08] what do you think of me what do you
[58:10] think about me what is your word say not
[58:12] God doesn't have an opinion here's his
[58:15] word because opinions can change based
[58:17] on circumstance but God has his word and
[58:19] he declares his word and that's it
[58:21] that's his full thought and it's not a
[58:24] partial thought that changes is his full
[58:26] thought so he sees you that you'll fully
[58:28] manifest as were in the sour that you
[58:30] will be his body and here's your head
[58:32] holy if that's how he thought of you
[58:34] that's how it's going to be hallelujah
[58:37] amen is identified by him she's
[58:40] independent from all others keep thee
[58:43] only unto her as long as you both shall
[58:45] live
[58:46] I'm sorry I'm back to this quote here
[58:47] keep the only to him the word no no
[58:50] adultery
[58:51] no sign of denomination no sign of creed
[58:53] no sign of adultery at all the word and
[58:55] him alone I'm Christ the solid rock I
[58:58] stand all other grounds of Sinking Sands
[59:01] said Eddie I'm said any opponent that's
[59:05] at Christ the word he was the word he is
[59:07] the word and the church becomes the word
[59:10] by him making her a part of him and
[59:13] that's the word again personally
[59:16] identified by him his property alone his
[59:19] property alone he has redeemed by she
[59:22] sorry is redeemed by him through him for
[59:25] him and for him alone that's right then
[59:28] what the devil's howling about is that
[59:30] it's being revealed the devil hates it
[59:33] when he is exposed and when a people's
[59:36] eyes come open and they begin to realize
[59:37] I don't have to be under this bondage of
[59:40] sin I don't have to be maybe I'll obtain
[59:42] and I'll get beaten back down again I
[59:44] mean that I'll try and maybe read you
[59:46] know people as I said the beginning
[59:48] people try and reform themselves and
[59:49] change their behavior to try and
[59:51] overcome but then God sends this message
[59:52] opens your eyes and he gives you a faith
[59:55] in your soul weak and stand up I mean
[59:58] you can take God at His Word
[59:59] hallelujah gives you over
[1:00:01] in power and it's him doing it
[1:00:03] hallelujah Amen Oh trust I can speak
[1:00:05] myself spending of many a time trying to
[1:00:08] overcome something in my own flesh
[1:00:09] holier but then I met the master how did
[1:00:12] I met the Lord Jesus Christ and I didn't
[1:00:15] have to try and overcome it anymore he
[1:00:16] did it for me
[1:00:18] hallelujah I know this gospel works
[1:00:21] friends this message produces Jesus
[1:00:23] Christ and a people I know because I've
[1:00:25] experienced it Alleluia amen identified
[1:00:30] oh the devil's howling about this the
[1:00:33] manifested truth of the promise of the
[1:00:35] word and her alone they don't have the
[1:00:38] answer then Jesus come why didn't those
[1:00:40] Pharisees he said if you cast out Devils
[1:00:43] by the finger of God who do you cast
[1:00:45] them out by sea he stood alone and his
[1:00:47] church stands alone she's not hooked
[1:00:50] with nothing but he was identified by
[1:00:52] God being the body that God God dwelt in
[1:00:55] and the church is identified by his body
[1:00:58] during the same thing she is his body
[1:01:01] the manifested truth of his promised
[1:01:03] word for the last days he's talking
[1:01:08] about me now remember you say well I
[1:01:12] could never obtain to that kind of way
[1:01:14] and think hey you're looking at yourself
[1:01:17] if the mirror is turned to you you will
[1:01:20] be disappointed but if you turn the
[1:01:22] mirror and keep it focused on here and
[1:01:24] you look at him remember this word
[1:01:27] should never you know this word is not a
[1:01:29] textbook this is a love leader and when
[1:01:32] we read is not Lord I want to learn it
[1:01:34] it's Lord changed my character as I read
[1:01:37] it that I become like you that's how we
[1:01:40] should read the Bible that's how we
[1:01:42] should listen to the message as Lord
[1:01:44] changed my character by your spirit
[1:01:46] there when it's all said and done I'll

[1:07:44] a wonderful day to be a believer
[1:07:46] hallelujah I'm so glad I can say I'm one
[1:07:49] of him they weren't singing those things
[1:07:51] they were the whole world had fallen
[1:07:54] apart they had to forsake all there was
[1:07:58] pressure in Israel he couldn't just
[1:08:00] leave the synagogue and follow this
[1:08:01] Jesus of Nazareth
[1:08:02] I mean ecumenical council put out a put
[1:08:06] out a declaration if any man goes to his
[1:08:09] meetings I'll be kicked out of the
[1:08:10] synagogue
[1:08:10] that's what the Sanhedrin said there was
[1:08:12] a real reproach for following this man
[1:08:14] of you know this man of Galilee and
[1:08:16] these people who suck all they're
[1:08:19] willing to bear their approach to follow
[1:08:21] this one and they followed him and they
[1:08:23] saw him cast out Devils speak to the
[1:08:26] storm and obeyed him death gave up her
[1:08:28] dead Lazarus was for four days in the
[1:08:31] grave begin to decay but corruption UITs
[1:08:33] master when when a man that wasn't - you
[1:08:35] know maybe too big in stature said
[1:08:37] Lazarus come forth and the prophet said
[1:08:40] that if he didn't say Lazarus it would
[1:08:41] have been a general resurrection
[1:08:43] cutler because i am the resurrection the
[1:08:45] life he says and the man is buddy who
[1:08:47] was big into the cake he came back to
[1:08:48] life again he came there but he came out
[1:08:50] of the tomb they'd never seen such
[1:08:52] things but now the Romans had taken him
[1:08:56] and he was now hanging on a cross and
[1:08:58] his body was now in a tomb they weren't
[1:09:01] rejoicing they weren't happy about it
[1:09:04] their whole life their whole world
[1:09:07] adjust for where can they go now where
[1:09:10] can they go they've been made outcasts
[1:09:12] by their own choosing to follow this one
[1:09:13] that they love and now he was dead the
[1:09:16] the disciples had sealed them up in a
[1:09:19] place and the treasurer you know Judas
[1:09:22] had had committed suicide so they
[1:09:25] weren't and they're walking on the way
[1:09:26] to Emmaus the whole world how do you
[1:09:28] think they felt how are you today
[1:09:30] Cleopas sin and your friend are you
[1:09:33] rejoicing how can I be rejoicing have
[1:09:37] you seen what's been going on don't you
[1:09:38] know what's happening and Jesus comes
[1:09:40] walks with them in another form he
[1:09:42] withholds who he is
[1:09:43] and he's been six hours
[1:09:47] opening the word to them then find they
[1:09:50] go into the house he breaks the bread
[1:09:51] their eyes come over and I see it's him
[1:09:53] now before that they were broken
[1:09:55] brother brand preacher Suman maunder
[1:09:58] beans made clear by the prophecy and he
[1:10:00] reached the - on the way to Emmaus
[1:10:01] and he says these modern events are made
[1:10:04] clear that's a prophecy Luke 24 is the
[1:10:06] prophecy and these modern events here
[1:10:08] and make clear by that prophecy how will
[1:10:11] the believers back then they were broken
[1:10:13] that didn't make them miss the
[1:10:15] resurrection that's what I'm trying to
[1:10:17] say it doesn't matter what state you
[1:10:19] find yourself in if you're on cloud nine
[1:10:21] or if you're down in the deepest pit
[1:10:23] you've been in your entire life that
[1:10:24] doesn't matter
[1:10:25] I mean out down in a pit they were
[1:10:28] broken but Jesus himself walked with
[1:10:31] them to make sure that they knew you're
[1:10:33] part of this resurrection partly because
[1:10:35] they had to be in the upper room I mean
[1:10:37] they had to be part of this resurrection
[1:10:39] hallelujah so Jesus went with them he
[1:10:44] didn't find the disciples that were
[1:10:45] happy or maybe you know the disciples
[1:10:48] that would think well if he's going to
[1:10:50] walk with me and and walk like that he's
[1:10:52] going to choose me because I'm the best
[1:10:53] and I perform the best and look at I've
[1:10:55] got I've got the best spiritual
[1:10:56] like he didn't go to those phones he
[1:10:58] went to the broken ones there's a say
[1:11:01] irrespective of where you find yourself
[1:11:02] that's irrelevant I mean he is here to
[1:11:06] ensure why this message come your way
[1:11:08] why did it come your way because he
[1:11:10] wanted you to know your polish
[1:11:12] resurrection I mean you're part of that
[1:11:14] redeemed group
[1:11:15] how are you part of my body that's why
[1:11:18] this message can you away amen this is
[1:11:21] not to make another Church to have a
[1:11:22] group of people different kind of doctor
[1:11:25] no it's a resurrection cold hallelujah
[1:11:28] brother says the bridegroom Court will
[1:11:30] come right through this it is the end of
[1:11:32] the man end of his ministry said the
[1:11:34] move is on for the bride is thus saith

[1:11:40] that bride redeem that bride cut all
[1:11:43] ties of Satan off that bride

[1:13:45] together to meet them to meet him in the
[1:13:47] air with them I have to go this there's
[1:13:51] no hooks

[1:13:55] no weights I have to go hallelujah amen
[1:14:00] they should give us an to be happy about
[1:14:03] Alleluia now such a glorious time but
[1:14:09] now when we come to thee come to the
[1:14:11] communion jesus says let's go to John
[1:14:14] chapter six real quick
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:22] I know this is familiar but I always
[1:14:24] this is special he's a lord sent and
[1:14:28] we'll read it ladies do this in
[1:14:29] remembrance of me
[1:14:30] we're remembering the Lord the Lord did
[1:14:33] incredible things for us incredible
[1:14:36] things
[1:14:37] it wasn't the you know just the physical
[1:14:40] beatings in the and the crown of thorns
[1:14:42] and the and marred beyond any man that's
[1:14:45] incredible but by carrying the weight of
[1:14:46] the sin of the world
[1:14:47] you remember when your sin weight became
[1:14:49] real do you remember that day and it
[1:14:54] felt like such a burdensome thing how
[1:14:56] could I be free hallelujah he didn't
[1:14:59] just take y'all I mean your own he took
[1:15:02] all of humanity that there ever will be
[1:15:05] he took all of us said no there's about
[1:15:08] 7 billion people on the earth now and I
[1:15:12] don't know how many have been before
[1:15:13] that's a lot of sin and he packed all
[1:15:17] that on his shoulders and he carried it
[1:15:19] as a man I've come over here that day
[1:15:22] that's amazing
[1:15:24] yeah so he says in John 6 and and 53
[1:15:32] this is then jesus said unto them verily
[1:15:34] verily I say unto you except you eat the
[1:15:37] flesh of the Son of man drink his blood
[1:15:40] you have no life in you who saw it whoso
[1:15:43] eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[1:15:45] hath eternal life and I'll raise him up
[1:15:48] at the last day for my flesh is meat
[1:15:50] indeed my blood is drink indeed he that
[1:15:53] eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[1:15:54] dwelleth in me and I in him as the
[1:15:57] living father has sent me and I live by
[1:15:59] the father so he that eateth me even he
[1:16:02] shall live by me this is that bread
[1:16:05] which came down from heaven not as your
[1:16:06] father's did eat manna and I did that he
[1:16:09] that eateth of this bread shall live
[1:16:11] forever now we understand he's not
[1:16:13] literally saying eating my physical body
[1:16:16] and drink my physical blood there's not
[1:16:18] really saying be saying if you become
[1:16:20] one with me just like in the Old
[1:16:22] Testament with the Passover their lamb
[1:16:24] that was slain to save the firstborn
[1:16:28] from the Death Angel they had to become
[1:16:30] one with that lamb I mean there was a
[1:16:33] time when there was the lamb and there
[1:16:34] was the people then that
[1:16:35] slam the blood was prone the door and
[1:16:37] lintel and they roasted the whole lamb
[1:16:39] with bitter herbs and they had to become
[1:16:41] one with their sacrifice I mean they had
[1:16:44] to become one with that lamb and this is
[1:16:47] what Jesus saying you must become one
[1:16:48] with me
[1:16:49] amen and we know by be to become one
[1:16:53] with him as when you he comes and dwells
[1:16:55] in you the Holy Ghost comes and dwells
[1:16:57] in the believer they become one amen so
[1:17:01] now this as the Catholics would say they
[1:17:04] say a prayer and it literally turns into
[1:17:05] his body and literally into his blood
[1:17:07] that is not true but that's what they
[1:17:10] believe this is just symbols of his body
[1:17:13] and his blood it's just symbolic right
[1:17:16] it doesn't literally turn into us into
[1:17:19] his flesh and his blood like they
[1:17:22] believe it's merely symbolic but by
[1:17:24] coming up and partaking of the Lord's
[1:17:25] table you are giving a public testimony
[1:17:28] that he is your head I mean and here's
[1:17:32] the word right not just part of him his
[1:17:35] whole word is now your headship amen and
[1:17:40] you are his body because you become one
[1:17:43] with him this is what you are making a
[1:17:45] declaration of right so this is why it's
[1:17:49] a joyous thing because I'm free just you
[1:17:53] are too but then it's also and we'll
[1:17:56] read it soon but it's also a very
[1:17:59] serious thing a sacred moment because
[1:18:04] you're you're actually declaring Lord
[1:18:06] all of your work all you workers Jesus
[1:18:08] is his word right in order for Jesus to
[1:18:12] be your head his whole word you have to
[1:18:14] subject yourself to him I meant not to
[1:18:17] your opinion not to man's ideas but to
[1:18:20] his word and as whole word as we
[1:18:22] manifested in the self that's why we're
[1:18:25] not living by opinion and a whole bunch
[1:18:28] of Bible School PhDs ll these DEA DS
[1:18:31] that they've got on walls amen and it
[1:18:33] edits everyone opinion to say well this
[1:18:35] is what it means no God came and said
[1:18:37] this is what my Bible says I am the
[1:18:39] author of my word I'm going to tell you
[1:18:40] what it says and he's told us what his
[1:18:42] word says hallelujah so we don't have to
[1:18:45] guess about anything
[1:18:47] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:18:49] angel when he shall begin to sound all
[1:18:51] the mystery of God would be finished
[1:18:53] it's been finished it's been revealed
[1:18:56] right so now when we come and partake of
[1:18:59] the Lord's table now we are saying he is
[1:19:01] my head
[1:19:02] I am his body by his sacrifice we've
[1:19:05] become one because he now dwells in me
[1:19:08] he's identified himself with me Amen
[1:19:12] they stirred the first Corinthians
[1:19:15] chapter 11
[1:19:27] I'm gonna read from verse 23 he says for
[1:19:39] I have received of the Lord there which
[1:19:43] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:19:46] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:19:48] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:19:51] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:19:54] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:19:56] you
[1:19:57] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:20:01] same manner also he took the cup and
[1:20:03] when he had supped saying this cup is
[1:20:06] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:20:09] as oft as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:20:12] me
[1:20:12] before as oft as you eat this bread and
[1:20:15] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:20:18] death till he come members coming
[1:20:20] finishes when we meet him in the air ok
[1:20:23] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:20:26] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:20:28] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:20:31] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:20:34] examine himself let him examine himself
[1:20:36] Lord are you my head am I your body this
[1:20:41] is the examination do I have to make
[1:20:44] something right with someone amen
[1:20:47] this is something I need to put right
[1:20:49] this is the examining and so let him eat
[1:20:52] of that bread and drink of that Cup
[1:20:54] but he that eateth and drinketh
[1:20:56] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:20:57] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:20:59] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:21:02] sickly among you many sleep for if we
[1:21:04] would judge ourselves we would not be
[1:21:06] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:21:09] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:21:11] be condemned with the world isn't it
[1:21:13] glorious
[1:21:14] isn't it wonderful when the Lord puts a
[1:21:15] finger on a part of your life so you've
[1:21:17] got to get this right he's not just
[1:21:19] telling you you know to make you feel
[1:21:22] bad he's showing you that you can be
[1:21:24] free of that thing I mean it's a
[1:21:26] glorious thing when the Lord puts
[1:21:27] something puts a finger on your life
[1:21:29] Amen that we should not be condemned
[1:21:31] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:21:33] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:21:36] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:21:38] him eat at home that you may come
[1:21:40] together under condemnation and the rest
[1:21:43] I will sit in order when I come so we've
[1:21:47] come to do this and remembrance of him
[1:21:50] so I said he's done a lot for us but now
[1:21:54] we're going to just change the order of
[1:21:57] service and ask brother could been to
[1:21:59] come forward going to help me to to
[1:22:01] minister the bread and the wine but I
[1:22:04] just before you come talk to the Lord
[1:22:09] search your heart say Lord
[1:22:12] we're instructed to examine ourselves I
[1:22:15] don't want to drink the wine or take the
[1:22:19] bread and worthily I meant and he said
[1:22:23] Lord I want you to be my head amen
[1:22:28] brother Brown had a person had a teenage
[1:22:31] girl she was back in the prayer alone
[1:22:33] and she started smoking cigarettes this
[1:22:36] is how quickly it takes to put things
[1:22:37] right and then about four people in
[1:22:39] front of her and the prayer line was a
[1:22:41] man that was smoking and the Spirit of
[1:22:44] God through the Prophet discerned that
[1:22:45] he was a smoker and and other things
[1:22:48] about his life and then sir the girl the
[1:22:51] teenage girl who's four people behind
[1:22:52] him in the prayer line didn't realize
[1:22:54] smoking was wrong and she prayed in her
[1:22:57] heart Lord forgive me I never want to
[1:22:59] smoke again please forgive me of doing
[1:23:00] it and then when she came up before the
[1:23:02] prophet of the Lord
[1:23:03] that wasn't even called out crews from
[1:23:07] there to here she put it under the blood
[1:23:10] it doesn't take a long time
[1:23:13] sincerely from the heart Lord forgive me
[1:23:15] changed me
[1:23:18] amen that's how easy it is we try and
[1:23:21] complicate things but you got to examine
[1:23:23] yourself and say Lord is there anything
[1:23:27] and he'll tell you if you're really
[1:23:28] sincere he will actually tell you you
[1:23:30] don't need to guess he's not the author
[1:23:32] of confusion right so now
