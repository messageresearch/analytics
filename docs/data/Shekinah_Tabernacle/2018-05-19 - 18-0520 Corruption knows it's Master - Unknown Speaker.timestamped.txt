[21:37] Oh
[21:44] [Music]
[21:46] Lloyd took my head with oil
[21:50] [Music]
[22:03] [Music]
[22:09] seats probably good morning everybody
[22:15] now as you know we we had our trip to
[22:18] Vegas and and I was quite apprehensive
[22:20] about the whole thing and and it was it
[22:25] turned out to be really good attended
[22:27] out to be to be nice and seeing seeing
[22:30] not in the world and not seeing
[22:32] everything that's wrong but seeing all
[22:35] the other things but the one thing that
[22:39] had happened and it was really it was
[22:40] actually quite amazing I was and when I
[22:43] still think about it just how good the
[22:45] Lord is that God is good and he keeps us
[22:48] safe and sound and the one died the
[22:51] first day that Tuesday morning we the
[22:54] main they were in the conference and in
[22:57] the the ladies decide it will go to the
[22:59] to one of the malls but then it happened
[23:02] that everybody split up and each was to
[23:04] they own and it was a bit of a mission
[23:08] getting on buses it's not as easy as
[23:10] it's here
[23:11] but yeah so I we went to them I went to
[23:15] the mall and I had a bit of a look
[23:16] around and got a few things and then I
[23:18] got on another bus I went on the
[23:22] northbound bus to the mall so my
[23:24] comments st. said okay so I need to take
[23:26] the southbound bus back but that wasn't
[23:30] the case I needed to take the northbound
[23:31] bus but okay so I got on the southbound
[23:33] bus so I'm sitting and I winked I said
[23:36] right at the back of the bus and I was
[23:41] so I'm trying to figure out where do I
[23:43] need to get off because also you can't
[23:45] ask the bus driver it was one of those
[23:48] big massive double buses but the bus
[23:50] driver was behind he wasn't a little
[23:52] enclosure so he
[23:53] can't really talk to him either okay so
[23:56] I got on the bus and I set and I saw as
[23:59] the door closed I saw okay so there is
[24:01] an indication of where I should get on
[24:03] and get off and I kind of figured out
[24:05] and I'm now here's me sitting on nervous
[24:08] I know I can't call hike because he's in
[24:10] the conference and as I'm sitting right
[24:14] at the back it was only me and then at
[24:16] one of the other stops there was a few
[24:19] guys that came on but it was it probably
[24:23] probably nothing would have happened but
[24:25] the way I felt in the way I experienced
[24:28] it was really I felt quite intimidating
[24:30] because it wasn't a few gangster guys
[24:32] and I was the only woman I was the only
[24:35] girl sitting there and the one tried to
[24:36] talk to me and I was like I'm all
[24:38] nervous I didn't really want to talk and
[24:40] I started I said and and as fear started
[24:44] groping my heart I was really starting
[24:46] to get so scared within myself because
[24:49] the girls and ladies would would
[24:52] probably feel the same being the only
[24:56] girl in all these strange men it's weird
[25:00] it doesn't feel you feel a bit
[25:02] intimidated but I come sitting and I'm
[25:04] as the fear just started to grab my
[25:07] heart this one gangster this one guy
[25:11] because they were they talk and it was
[25:14] foul language it was really it wasn't a
[25:17] nice situation and as he went and he
[25:22] gripped the pole of the bus on his arm
[25:26] was tattooed Matthew 28:20 I am with you
[25:30] always and as I read that it was like I
[25:34] knew that the Lord is they protected me
[25:38] regardless probably I would have gotten
[25:40] off the bus I would have been fine I
[25:41] would have been but just that fear
[25:44] gripped my heart and the Lord saw it
[25:46] right there and he stopped it and it was
[25:49] just it was amazing even in Vegas he can
[25:52] do that
[25:55] [Applause]
[26:03] than that true yes it is anymore
[26:07] testimony testimony time no yes you may
[26:27] but I was doing mom dad's tax inside and
[26:31] not see if I hear dad's down in the
[26:33] she'd he said all tweets he's fixing
[26:35] some bikes so I thought okay then that's
[26:36] fine because I kind of had to keep an
[26:38] eye on where it is and the next minute
[26:42] dad comes in and he's rubbing his chest
[26:45] like what's happened here and he said
[26:49] all right I see does Jordan because he's
[26:52] had a mammogram and ultrasound just
[26:54] recently some swelling that's going on
[26:56] in and I said as they're honoring you do
[26:58] you need to take a pen at all you all
[27:00] right a nude women
[27:01] he says I've just had a fall and I went
[27:03] what anyway he had taken a letter out of
[27:08] his sheet a great little long letter and
[27:10] he got it up somehow with any less than
[27:13] eighty percent of his heart and he never
[27:15] carries that letter I do but anyway he
[27:17] got up to the tree and there was a tree
[27:19] behind the garage and he had extended it
[27:22] and he climbed the ladder with an
[27:23] electric chainsaw and it chopped a
[27:27] branch and the letter had gone one way
[27:30] and he'd gone the other way but he
[27:31] doesn't remember he remembers waking up
[27:33] on the ground with the chainsaw
[27:37] any cheese I still read and I said well
[27:40] I'm see rid of the momento
[27:42] but you know recently what you he has
[27:45] captured through yes Amen you know he
[27:48] see
[27:49] yes this is my finger was still in the
[27:50] trigger and I was like oh praise the
[27:53] Lord but you know he said oh I realized
[27:57] you know I shouldn't have fired done it
[27:59] and Isis will okay it's a little bit
[28:02] late but it's you know believed you
[28:03] think that you shouldn't have done that
[28:05] now and I'm you know really pleased that
[28:09] God is in our house you know it's not up
[28:15] to me to keep a watch on your time
[28:18] because I care about your Prius I think
[28:23] thank you so much in your Prius in here
[28:28] just keeping constant because yeah it is
[28:30] some things are going downhill yeah and
[28:34] you know that's just of the world but I
[28:36] know that it generally mum and dad we're
[28:39] going to be all together
[28:44] I told Edie sister Robbins one um the
[28:57] Lord is our protector and our guide and
[28:59] for that I'm so thankful and before
[29:01] being a Christian I never knew the Lord
[29:05] so we did pray but we never prayed for
[29:06] protection and that's something that's
[29:08] become a part of our praises protection
[29:10] and then the Lord really does listen to
[29:13] those priests so he came to church two
[29:15] weeks ago to Keane and some of you love
[29:16] her - taste the money oh really
[29:17] and I gave the boys a packet of chips
[29:19] and sent them to the mother's room so
[29:21] they can sit in each one I'm busy
[29:22] cleaning and while I'm cleaning and not
[29:26] vacuuming thankfully I hear this air
[29:28] coming from the back and I'm like that
[29:31] does not sound good
[29:33] and so I start walking and I hear it
[29:35] going on and evasions like
[29:37] DM Liam cuz I media in front and I run
[29:39] to the back and I'm like Liam what's
[29:41] wrong and he's just going hey hey not
[29:43] like you have something stuck in your
[29:45] throat and he's just nodding his head
[29:46] away and so I'm
[29:49] I try to teach me first date a while
[29:51] back and this is where I'm also grateful
[29:52] that the law doesn't punish you when you
[29:55] don't listen so you try to teach me and
[29:58] I was just like yeah yeah the boys are
[30:00] fine I'm fine don't really need to know
[30:02] completely switched off and so I did the
[30:04] first thing my mommy taught me which was
[30:06] you stick your finger in a throat and
[30:07] you try and dislodge whatever's in the
[30:09] throat and I managed to completely put
[30:12] the chip in his a way that he couldn't
[30:14] get any ear at all and I tried a second
[30:17] time with a finger and nothing came out
[30:18] and the whole time I'm standing and I'm
[30:20] just thinking what did I mine say what
[30:22] did he say my price has gone blank I
[30:25] just couldn't remember anything and so
[30:26] I'm hitting him on his back because I
[30:27] know that's one of them but nothing's
[30:29] happening and the time that it took for
[30:32] his lips to start going blue was amazing
[30:35] it was seconds and I'm just saying then
[30:37] I'm just thinking I'm alone a church I
[30:39] have nobody what am I gonna do if we
[30:41] don't get this there's launched and I'm
[30:42] hitting him on the back and I'm just
[30:43] like what did I might say and I couldn't
[30:45] remember and I just grabbed him around
[30:48] the middle I just pushed it it came out
[30:53] thankful cause I might see if there was
[30:56] no any dislikes that would have done
[31:00] anything and I didn't know to do CPR and
[31:03] my son would have died that day I'm so
[31:07] thankful that the Lord then punish me
[31:09] for that listing and that he looks after
[31:12] my children every day and keeps him safe
[31:15] and he renew the love inside me kept my
[31:18] family to realize how precious life is
[31:20] on this earth so I just wanna say thank
[31:23] you God for your hand in my life
[31:28] [Applause]
[31:43] amen
[31:44] I greet you in the wonderful name for
[31:46] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's
[31:48] good to be home family you don't know
[31:52] how privileged we are to be one with the
[31:58] Lord to be found in his presence to have
[32:01] the freedom that we have here in New
[32:03] Zealand to be joined to be gathered in
[32:06] his name no pressure no oppression
[32:10] nothing I come from India being the tune
[32:13] of weeks and I bring you greetings from
[32:17] the pastor's that I met the lovely
[32:20] people but so oppressed so pressured by
[32:24] the Hindu spirit around him we've got
[32:29] the freedom we can sing on the top of
[32:32] our voices we can shout out to the Lord
[32:35] they can't do that they only got certain
[32:38] places that they can go to and they
[32:40] don't have that freedom and liberty that
[32:42] we have so keep them in your prayers
[32:45] there's two places that I met they two
[32:48] lovely men of God
[32:49] pastor Shinde Steven Shinde and pastor
[32:53] Jack Rodriguez they have their hearts
[32:57] all out for the Lord and for their
[32:59] people they're doing a wonderful job
[33:01] there in India or Mumbai
[33:03] there's about 28 churches in that area
[33:05] itself but because of the distance that
[33:09] they have to travel therefore there's so
[33:10] many churches so lots of churches are
[33:12] broken off from the main church and but
[33:15] when they have a gathering when they
[33:16] have a fellowship time when they have
[33:19] shared meetings everyone makes it the
[33:21] duty to get there so what I learnt there
[33:24] was the unity and the love that they
[33:29] have no matter we go to a church in
[33:31] Taranaki or to Auckland or to
[33:33] Christchurch when there's something
[33:35] happening when does a visiting minister
[33:37] when these praise and worship
[33:41] you know everyone comes together and
[33:44] that was wonderful to see wonderful to
[33:46] see the unity and I hope that can be
[33:49] something for us here in New Zealand as
[33:51] well you know stand by the pastor stand
[33:54] by the the other churches and stand as
[33:56] one so yes please pray for India and I'm
[34:00] glad to be back
[34:01] amen this thought occurred to me earlier
[34:16] as well when I was looking at that young
[34:18] man over there you know he walks us into
[34:22] this into this life he walks us through
[34:24] that door when we open up our eyes you
[34:29] know and it doesn't matter how lonely if
[34:32] you feel in your life when you close
[34:36] your eyes on this earth you will walk
[34:38] you out that door game you won't walk
[34:41] through that door line he walks you
[34:43] through that door amen and our thoughts
[34:46] with you guys as well in this time and

[51:29] musicians amen amen
[51:32] praise the Lord isn't he wonderful
[51:36] if you want to turn in your Bibles while
[51:38] we're standing hallelujah to to
[51:44] Leviticus chapter 16 and as a privilege
[51:49] to be here amen and you know that I've
[51:52] personally gone under the knife of the
[51:56] divine physician and so you know this is
[51:59] the first time I preached since I you
[52:01] know to you guys anyway I've preached a
[52:03] lot and in the world and missions and
[52:06] things but here and so it's kind of
[52:09] almost like a debut for me I don't know
[52:13] how to explain it but it's really
[52:14] something precious amen and I'm just so
[52:17] thankful to the Lord hallelujah amen so
[52:20] I want to speak this morning on
[52:21] corruption knows its master who's
[52:24] thankful that even corruption knows its
[52:27] master
[52:28] Alleluia I will explain that if you
[52:30] don't know what that means soon
[52:32] amen but it's a good thing it's a very
[52:34] good thing amen
[52:35] hallelujah amen so let's just read from
[52:44] here I'm gonna put that in Spanish for
[52:48] the Spanish speakers so it says here and
[52:53] Aaron shall bring the bullock of the
[52:55] sin-offering which is for himself and
[52:57] shall make an atonement for himself and
[53:00] for his house and shall kill the bullock
[53:02] of the sin-offering
[53:03] which is for himself and he shall take a
[53:06] sensor full of burning coals of fire
[53:08] from off the altar before the Lord and
[53:11] his hands full of sweet and since beaten
[53:14] small and bring it within the veil and
[53:17] he shall put the incense upon the fire
[53:20] before the Lord that the cloud of
[53:23] incense may cover the mercy seat that is
[53:27] upon the testimony that he died not so
[53:30] this was a very serious time you know
[53:34] these priests did not go into that place
[53:36] willy-nilly they were very serious and
[53:39] they were well prepared amen very
[53:43] serious you know and they were fear
[53:45] there was a fear of God because if they
[53:48] did something wrong they would die and I
[53:51] don't know in history sees it or not but
[53:53] they probably was a few high priests
[53:55] that did something wrong and they tied a
[53:57] little rope around him and pulled him
[53:59] out if he didn't come out after a
[54:01] certain amount of time so it was a very
[54:03] serious occasion this is the atonement
[54:06] sacrifice that was made once a year and
[54:09] he now I want emphasis on this but here
[54:13] and he shall take the blood off the
[54:15] Bullock which is a cow and well I think
[54:19] it's a cow anyway and sprinkle it with
[54:22] his finger upon the mercy seat Eastwood
[54:26] Eastwood physik that that's all symbolic
[54:31] spread at Eastwood and before the mercy
[54:35] seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with
[54:38] his finger seven times you may be seated
[54:43] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[54:45] word amen
[54:48] corruption knows its master it's
[54:52] actually a very powerful statement that
[54:55] was made by the prophet
[54:57] and he particularly made that statement
[55:02] when speaking about the story of Lazarus
[55:05] when Lazarus was raised up from the dead
[55:08] and he was am here was a man that had
[55:11] been dead for four days and after four
[55:15] days of being dead the body starts to
[55:17] decay and the nose starts to fallen and
[55:20] thinks that's a degrade and Jesus the
[55:27] fullness of the word the Son of God
[55:30] spoke a word saying come forth and when
[55:34] he spoke that word that power of that
[55:38] word went from here and this dimension
[55:40] went way out into the regions of
[55:43] Abraham's bosom where Lazarus had sold
[55:46] had left and gone to and it called him
[55:49] back but not only did it call his soul
[55:52] back into this dimension but it also
[55:55] took the corruption of the flesh the
[55:58] body that had already started rotting
[56:00] and stinking and it made it completely
[56:02] brand new again and that is the master
[56:07] of over corruption even corruption knows
[56:11] the master and when the master speaks
[56:14] there is nothing no power no corruption
[56:17] no rottenness no degradation no complex
[56:21] no spiritual fissure or rip in your
[56:25] spirit or anything that can resist the
[56:28] power of that voice and when that voice
[56:31] speaks everything in your life knows its
[56:34] master amen and we're completely
[56:38] dependent on him and that passage of
[56:44] Scripture that we just read that passage
[56:51] of Scripture I just read it's about the
[56:56] Feast of the atonement so once a year
[56:59] the high priest and the Old Testament
[57:01] had to take to her there was quite a
[57:04] process but you know just to brief you
[57:08] on that process he he
[57:09] had to kill Bullock and take the blood
[57:13] of that sacrifice and here as the high
[57:17] priest went beyond the veil and he took
[57:21] some coals and he took some incense and
[57:23] he and he popped and when he went in he
[57:27] had to put the incense on and the smell
[57:29] and the cloud that because the hot coals
[57:31] and incense went on had to basically put
[57:34] a big cloud inside the holy of holies so
[57:36] that he didn't die because there was a
[57:38] certain process and God was showing many
[57:40] types and things in there which we're
[57:41] not going to go into today but this one
[57:43] thing that he went in there and he took
[57:46] the blood of this sacrificed animal that
[57:48] took the place of Israel sins and he
[57:51] flipped it seven times on the mercy seat
[57:56] Eastwood because it was showing the sign
[57:59] and I will show I'll just basically tell
[58:02] you now that is symbolic of when Jesus
[58:07] went into the Holy of Holies once for
[58:10] all when he ascended up into heaven he
[58:14] was the high priest and it was his own
[58:17] blood the blood of God that was taken up
[58:21] into the hot real holy of Holy's now the
[58:24] Holy of Holies in the Old Testament was
[58:26] a shadow was a pattern that Moses saw
[58:29] but Jesus it was just a pattern a shadow
[58:33] of what the reality was the reality is
[58:36] that Jesus took his blood up into heaven
[58:39] and to the real Holy of Holies before
[58:42] the throne of the Almighty and he and
[58:46] for seven church ages for seven ages for
[58:49] two thousand years he was in that place
[58:52] and he sprinkled his blood his blood was
[58:55] on the mercy seat for seven church ages
[58:58] and the blood was sprinkled hitting
[59:00] Eastwood because the gospel is just like
[59:05] the Sun and it goes from west to east
[59:08] and it travels it's traveled around the
[59:11] earth that's headed east all the way
[59:13] around the earth the gospel for seven
[59:16] church ages and has gone around the
[59:18] earth and come right back and now it's
[59:21] heading east again that's the
[59:23] the West has been you know it's been
[59:25] saturated with the gospel yes there will
[59:27] be handfuls of purpose there's still
[59:29] people to come in there's still mercy
[59:31] but the predominant move of the gospel
[59:36] is really hitting the east and it's
[59:38] knocking on the doors of Jerusalem and
[59:40] Greece and these places that were first
[59:44] there it was the first places that it
[59:46] was it's returning back east again and
[59:48] we know that the days of the Gentiles
[59:51] mercy we are all Gentiles here there's
[59:54] no Jews here right no there may be but
[59:59] we are all Gentiles will come under a
[1:00:01] Gentile covenant
[1:00:02] so therefore the day of Gentile mercy is
[1:00:06] almost at its int we're in a gleaning
[1:00:10] time there is the mercy of God as going
[1:00:14] back to the Jews but for seven ages the
[1:00:18] blood of the of God himself the high
[1:00:21] priest himself God playing the part of
[1:00:24] the high priest and his great plan of
[1:00:26] redemption as in that Holy of Holies and
[1:00:29] he sprinkled blood on the mercy seat for
[1:00:32] seven ages Eastwood now I want to read
[1:00:39] this because I'm going to show you a
[1:00:41] pretty awesome type to tie in that story
[1:00:46] to the events that have happened today
[1:00:49] now yes the amazing thing is you know
[1:00:52] and been preached the sermon last Sunday
[1:00:54] and I this was already pre-prepared and
[1:00:57] everything you know the sermon so I
[1:01:00] might think I you know and he's just
[1:01:02] following along from brother Ben and
[1:01:05] just taking his notes and just you know
[1:01:07] you know I'll just make sure that I just
[1:01:09] carry on the foot but actually it was
[1:01:11] God God gave me all these thoughts
[1:01:13] before and I was sitting there going
[1:01:14] this was amazing this is amazing you
[1:01:18] know like it was just like everything
[1:01:19] that he preached it was like many the
[1:01:21] the same very same vain he inspired me
[1:01:25] to minister about today with the events
[1:01:29] of today just to give us an awareness
[1:01:30] and I know that we've probably heard
[1:01:32] some of these things before all if not
[1:01:33] all of these things before but you know
[1:01:35] as Peter said
[1:01:36] just bring these things to your
[1:01:37] remembrance because it's always good to
[1:01:39] have these things refreshed in our minds
[1:01:42] and while they looks now this is the
[1:01:44] Apostles you know this is the this is
[1:01:46] Acts chapter one and annex chapter one
[1:01:51] the Apostles that Jesus that just
[1:01:52] basically said his goodbyes and he's
[1:01:54] about to give been taken up into heaven
[1:01:56] and now after he's taken up they're all
[1:01:59] standing there looking up you know and
[1:02:01] it says here and while they looked
[1:02:03] steadfastly towards heaven as he went up
[1:02:06] behold two men stood by them in white
[1:02:09] apparel white clothes which also said Ye
[1:02:12] men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up
[1:02:16] into heaven the same Jesus which has
[1:02:19] taken up from you into heaven shall so
[1:02:22] come in like manner as you have seen him
[1:02:25] go into heaven so here you and you've
[1:02:29] probably heard this but I'm going to say
[1:02:30] it again here is very an our generation
[1:02:35] we have seen the return in like manner
[1:02:39] and who knows what that is it's that's
[1:02:43] it happened in 1963 in a prophets
[1:02:47] ministry just before the seal was opened
[1:02:49] to reveal the person of Jesus Christ to
[1:02:52] the bride there he's come through he
[1:02:56] shows himself when seven angels lift the
[1:02:58] prophet went up into the sky and formed
[1:03:01] a cloud and the very high priest himself
[1:03:05] now after spending two thousand years
[1:03:08] sprinkling his blood on the mercy seat
[1:03:10] for seven ages and the gospel going
[1:03:13] around the earth he comes back out after
[1:03:17] his work has finished now it doesn't
[1:03:20] mean that Mercy's over because he is the
[1:03:23] seat of mercy he is the mercy of God he
[1:03:27] is mercy he is the very seat he's the
[1:03:31] place where mercy is issued from because
[1:03:34] he is the Christ the Son of God the
[1:03:36] propitiation for essence a piece of
[1:03:39] geography a piece of slab of gold that
[1:03:41] we may think is in heaven is not our
[1:03:43] mercy it was symbolic of a place where
[1:03:47] mirth where God met the people
[1:03:49] but where do we meet crock God through
[1:03:53] whom have we been reconciled to the
[1:03:55] Father through the seat of mercy which
[1:03:59] as a person which is Jesus Christ
[1:04:02] and yes the priesthood was a shadow
[1:04:04] could not perfectly tell the story
[1:04:07] that's why they had a high priest which
[1:04:09] was a man that had light passions was
[1:04:11] where and failed and did those things he
[1:04:13] had to go in once a year and the head
[1:04:16] there was a there was a mercy seat
[1:04:18] between the cherubims it was a place
[1:04:20] where God could come but it was not a
[1:04:22] perfect as the book of Hebrews is it was
[1:04:26] not perfect in every way
[1:04:28] there had to be something better come
[1:04:30] and the better was Christ himself
[1:04:33] who would and became who would be the
[1:04:36] very seat of mercy so here we have the
[1:04:40] high priest who went up and the Apostles
[1:04:43] were looking in and here God is showing
[1:04:45] us a story that in like manner he would
[1:04:48] return again and we saw and have
[1:04:52] witnessed the high priest himself step
[1:04:55] out from the veil of man's traditions
[1:04:59] step out from the veil of man's
[1:05:01] intellect step out from the veil that
[1:05:05] had imprisoned in hell back mercy and
[1:05:08] have not have mercy how back truth held
[1:05:11] back the people from really having an
[1:05:13] episodic experience having the full
[1:05:16] experience of what Calvary purchased and
[1:05:19] that's what Satan did is he dumbed down
[1:05:22] the truths little by little until that
[1:05:24] there was hardly anything there and you
[1:05:27] have a Catholic Church you have Roman
[1:05:29] Catholicism and that's all that was left
[1:05:31] almost and the underground church and
[1:05:34] the people that stood for what they
[1:05:36] could was persecuted and beaten down and
[1:05:38] it was as brother Branham calls it a
[1:05:40] stump that a bride tree the tree of
[1:05:43] God's church had become done to a stump
[1:05:46] but God said I would restore amen and
[1:05:49] the only way to restore it back as that
[1:05:53] he would come himself amen
[1:05:56] that he himself would descend and he
[1:05:59] would reveal himself amen
[1:06:02] but he didn't do it
[1:06:03] straightaway he God used a process where
[1:06:06] he he prepared the ground he sent Luther
[1:06:10] he sent he he freed the people from
[1:06:13] trying to earn their salvation we cannot
[1:06:16] earn our salvation and he freed the
[1:06:18] people because Roman Catholicism based
[1:06:22] basically put it that you have to do so
[1:06:25] many things and penance and follow the
[1:06:27] priest to have salvation even not even
[1:06:29] know if you've got it completely and
[1:06:31] look God said Luther to free the people
[1:06:33] by a justification by faith that you
[1:06:37] could believe and receive your salvation
[1:06:39] and then he furthered it along with in
[1:06:42] the move and the time of John Wesley and
[1:06:43] the Methodist movement and cleaned the
[1:06:45] people's lives by the power of his blood
[1:06:47] by the power of His Holy Spirit he
[1:06:50] cleaned the people's lives and then in
[1:06:52] the time of the Pentecostal outpouring
[1:06:55] Azusa Street when the gifts were
[1:06:57] restored he started bringing power back
[1:06:59] to the church bringing these operations
[1:07:02] to help the church back but he wasn't
[1:07:05] finished he was preparing the ground he
[1:07:08] was preparing the people that so they
[1:07:10] that the bride could receive the person
[1:07:14] yes it was the person all the way
[1:07:18] through Christ was that he revealed
[1:07:22] himself in part so he only gave a
[1:07:24] portion of himself he only revealed a
[1:07:26] portion of himself but then in the end
[1:07:28] time the high priest breaks the veil of
[1:07:31] men's traditions and he steps out and he
[1:07:36] reveals himself and like manner as they
[1:07:39] had seen him go and a cloud appeared
[1:07:41] over Sunset mountain and went from there
[1:07:45] single sunset mountain and went froze
[1:07:47] ona right down the east coast and it was
[1:07:50] seen by many millions and it was
[1:07:53] witnessed because you see Jesus said
[1:07:56] there would be signs in the heaven and
[1:07:58] the end times and this was a sign that
[1:08:02] the high priest had returned and not
[1:08:04] just the high priest remember God plays
[1:08:06] roles he has he has certain roles that
[1:08:09] he plays in one of the roles is the
[1:08:10] white wood judge and this what when when
[1:08:15] brother Branham didn't know what
[1:08:16] all men he just thought that was a cloud
[1:08:18] and he thought it was amazing and then
[1:08:20] the Lord said turn it to the right
[1:08:23] anti-clockwise or clockwise can't
[1:08:25] remember Matt Turner and he saw the
[1:08:28] white winged judge we see the Hoffman's
[1:08:30] head of Christ and we see the white wig
[1:08:33] on him and that's to show that the judge
[1:08:35] has come the king has come to place
[1:08:39] judgment judgment on those that reject
[1:08:42] and also a judgment on those that
[1:08:45] receive and he judges mercy any judges
[1:08:48] condemnation there is a definitive
[1:08:53] ministry that would come in the end time
[1:08:55] to bring a definitive prophesy a sure
[1:09:00] word that we could hang our lives upon
[1:09:03] amen because now it's not we're not just
[1:09:06] tossed about by every wind of doctrine
[1:09:08] we're not looking at the fashions of
[1:09:11] Christianity and seeing the new man of
[1:09:14] the hour that has some funny idea that
[1:09:17] may be slightly different from what it's
[1:09:18] been and it changes and it changes and
[1:09:20] it changes what we're having entered
[1:09:23] into is a personal relationship with the
[1:09:26] revealed high priest who's the person
[1:09:29] has come and the that's why the more you
[1:09:32] look into the word the more that he
[1:09:34] shows you it becomes richer and deeper
[1:09:37] and more clear amen and your life
[1:09:41] becomes more holy more like him not
[1:09:45] because you have to because that's
[1:09:46] happening to you you're under an
[1:09:49] anointing to bring you to perfection
[1:09:51] you're under an anointing to make you
[1:09:54] ready for a rapture and it's not
[1:09:57] something you've earned you can't earn
[1:09:59] it it's not something that you can study
[1:10:00] out and completely it's something that
[1:10:03] he gives you it's something that he
[1:10:05] reveals to you and unfolds to you
[1:10:08] personally in your walk with him amen
[1:10:12] and that's why you know my prayer I said
[1:10:13] let's enjoy our life with the Lord don't
[1:10:17] get wound up and flustered that you
[1:10:21] haven't prayed enough or that you when
[1:10:23] you do pray on just not been in turn
[1:10:25] because I'm only gonna have 10 minutes
[1:10:26] and dinner you're just gonna you know
[1:10:28] get flustered you don't want to do that
[1:10:30] you want even if it's two minutes enjoy
[1:10:32] it have a look have a good time of the
[1:10:35] Lord for two minutes
[1:10:36] amen enjoy your relationship with them
[1:10:40] you know that if you enjoy the two
[1:10:43] minutes eventually you'll enjoy an hour
[1:10:46] and not because you have to or you you
[1:10:49] will just because when you're relaxed
[1:10:51] and when you're enjoying the presence of
[1:10:53] God you can actually grow and you can do
[1:10:56] things that help you you know but when
[1:10:59] you're all tense and you get flustered
[1:11:02] I'm preaching to myself just as good man
[1:11:05] because I'm a zealous person and zealous
[1:11:08] people you know they can struggle with
[1:11:09] these things but we all struggle with
[1:11:11] the same things you know well and it's
[1:11:14] if we get all tense we it's very hard
[1:11:18] for us to enjoy it and then you just
[1:11:21] don't want to do it anymore the devil
[1:11:22] just get sins that's working and you
[1:11:24] miss out and then you start getting
[1:11:27] carnally minded and you start thinking
[1:11:29] carnal thoughts and carnal out the
[1:11:32] carnal mind is enmity with against God
[1:11:34] it's very difficult but the good thing
[1:11:37] is if we can just rest and relax and
[1:11:40] allow God and enjoy our relationship
[1:11:42] enjoy our time amen enjoy the sermon
[1:11:46] amen just just don't worry about time
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:51] and now I'm not saying that because I'm
[1:11:53] going to preach for three hours amen but
[1:11:56] we have into the eternity
[1:11:58] hallelujah so the high priest has
[1:12:02] returned from his seven ages of blood
[1:12:04] sprinkling and you so I basically given
[1:12:10] you a bit of a background on this type
[1:12:12] here because it is actually quite
[1:12:14] significant to us because we are a
[1:12:17] privileged people in this hour
[1:12:20] sorry I should have put that in Spanish
[1:12:22] Bernie's not here he can see it as he
[1:12:25] watching oh good I should put that on
[1:12:28] for him um so the it's quite amazing
[1:12:36] John's song service was perfectly you
[1:12:40] know matching so I want to talk a little
[1:12:43] bit about the Jew
[1:12:44] beliee as well because the you know I
[1:12:48] read that first passage of Scripture
[1:12:50] that I've read there is about the
[1:12:52] atonement the Feast of the atonement and
[1:12:54] the once a year the high priests had to
[1:12:57] go and he made an atonement sacrifice
[1:12:59] for the people without that Israel had
[1:13:01] no fellowship with God they had there
[1:13:03] was no fellowship without that atonement
[1:13:05] it was a vitally important for Israel
[1:13:07] that the high priest would make that one
[1:13:09] sacrifice per year
[1:13:11] oh that's you know there's there was
[1:13:13] hundreds of other sacrifices and other
[1:13:14] offerings and everything but this one
[1:13:17] central atonement sacrifice was very
[1:13:20] vital for Israel's fellowship with God
[1:13:22] and without that they did not have God
[1:13:25] amongst them there was no fellowship
[1:13:27] without the shedding of this blood
[1:13:28] that's why we realized that when Christ
[1:13:32] ascended up and his blood went on this
[1:13:34] mercy was sprinkled over the mercy seat
[1:13:37] for seven ages that is of vital
[1:13:39] importance that that happened because
[1:13:41] the blood that paid the sin the blood
[1:13:44] that was spilled a human's blood that
[1:13:46] was spilled was perfect blood it
[1:13:49] answered the call for men to pay his
[1:13:53] penalty it answered it and and and
[1:13:58] because of that the fellowship was
[1:14:00] restored amen hallelujah and so I want
[1:14:07] to just just so you can you know we know
[1:14:10] about the seven feasts bin's preached on
[1:14:11] the seven feasts and typed in with
[1:14:13] Christ and they are all pointing towards
[1:14:16] Christ and I'm not going to go into all
[1:14:18] of them I don't understand it all
[1:14:20] completely I mean I can I have my
[1:14:22] thoughts but to really grasp the whole
[1:14:24] thing I don't fully understand every
[1:14:27] part of it so the parts that I do
[1:14:28] understand I will share so the feasts
[1:14:32] are now down I'm only going to do the
[1:14:33] last one two three four
[1:14:36] four because these ones I really
[1:14:40] understand I can see it I can just see
[1:14:42] it clearly of the fulfillment of certain
[1:14:46] events that have happened in our day
[1:14:48] match the feasts there so the feast of
[1:14:53] Pentecost the Pentecost the feast was
[1:14:56] the time of the harvest it was fifty
[1:14:58] days
[1:14:58] after the Passover and we know that the
[1:15:00] the the fulfillment of the Old Testament
[1:15:04] was that Jesus was the Passover lamb
[1:15:07] 2,000 years ago the lamb was sacrificed
[1:15:10] by the priests the priests sacrificed
[1:15:12] the Lamb of God and that they became
[1:15:16] that he became the Passover lamb and
[1:15:18] then he he went down into hell and he
[1:15:22] took the keys off Satan and he came back
[1:15:23] up amen and then he and then he ascended
[1:15:28] up and fifty days later typing the feast
[1:15:31] the Spirit of God was poured out on the
[1:15:34] people and the feast of Pentecost was
[1:15:37] made with bread
[1:15:38] they had living in it and that was a
[1:15:40] symbol of the church that was the bread
[1:15:42] of God and the church has living inside
[1:15:45] them you know we have we have old
[1:15:47] natures and we're in a battle we're in
[1:15:49] the land we're in the promised land and
[1:15:51] yet we're fighting enemies still it's
[1:15:53] still things happening they're still
[1:15:55] victories to be won it's not we're not
[1:15:57] in a perfect environment yet amen as
[1:16:00] much as our Solars and our future as
[1:16:03] sealed to a perfect environment we are
[1:16:06] still in the battle we're still fighting
[1:16:08] we're still pressing in with all of our
[1:16:10] hearts pressing the battle amen
[1:16:12] so the Feast of Pentecost happened 50
[1:16:15] days after the Passover and so the Feast
[1:16:21] of Pentecost the Pentecostal outpouring
[1:16:23] of the Spirit happened in 1906 and the
[1:16:27] gifts were restored then after the feast
[1:16:29] of Pentecost there was the Feast of
[1:16:31] Trumpets I'm sorry if I'm going too fast
[1:16:33] of all of us but for the interest of
[1:16:37] time so the Feast of Trumpets the
[1:16:40] purpose of that Feast of Trumpets that
[1:16:42] came after the feast of Pentecost was to
[1:16:44] gather Azrael it was to gather them
[1:16:46] together and so two of these trumpets
[1:16:49] the seven trumpets of God and the Feast
[1:16:52] of Trumpets in our day we have the fifth
[1:16:55] trumpet and the sixth trumpet was World
[1:16:57] War one and World War two there was
[1:17:00] three woes and those were the two first
[1:17:01] woes and they were this first trumpet
[1:17:04] and the sixth trumpet so that places it
[1:17:06] clearly one of the clearest pieces of
[1:17:09] scripture to place the
[1:17:12] in time so now we have an accurate time
[1:17:15] measurement from the Feast of Trumpets
[1:17:18] which the fifth trumpet and the sixth
[1:17:21] trumpet who was the very center of
[1:17:23] attention of those two things the Jews
[1:17:26] what happened after World War two the
[1:17:29] Jews went home the Jews were in their
[1:17:33] land again their Feast of Trumpets
[1:17:35] called Israel - the atonement in the
[1:17:40] atonement now because remember Israel
[1:17:43] Israel doesn't come to the atonement the
[1:17:46] full atonement until before us we come
[1:17:50] in first the Gentiles come in first
[1:17:52] because they had their chance
[1:17:54] 2,000 years ago when Jesus ministered
[1:17:56] and the Apostles ministered and then the
[1:17:59] mercy left the Jews and came to the
[1:18:00] Gentiles so now the atonement the the
[1:18:04] the high priest himself 2,000 years ago
[1:18:07] went up and entered into the Holy of
[1:18:10] Holies and for seven ages he sprinkled
[1:18:13] his blood over the mercy seat and then
[1:18:15] in 1963 he came back out of that Holy of
[1:18:20] Holies to reveal himself to his bride to
[1:18:24] prepare her so that he might present her
[1:18:28] to himself in Ephesians 5 it says that
[1:18:32] we would be washed by the water of the
[1:18:34] word and that he who has revealed
[1:18:37] himself and come down in the last days
[1:18:39] to reveal himself to present the bride
[1:18:43] back to himself an eternity and I'll
[1:18:46] show you that duality for this atonement
[1:18:51] here
[1:18:51] because you see there was an atonement
[1:18:54] yearly in Israel every year the priest
[1:18:57] winter and and he made this atonement
[1:18:58] but then every fourteen ninth years so
[1:19:02] seven years there was sip every sip yeah
[1:19:07] it's seven years there was a there was a
[1:19:10] certain feast there was a certain
[1:19:12] celebration but then in the 49th year
[1:19:15] which was seven lots of seven there was
[1:19:18] a Jubilee and that Jubilee when that
[1:19:21] happened the the atonement sacrifice was
[1:19:24] the same but then
[1:19:25] when the atonement was made there was a
[1:19:27] Jubilee trumpet that sounded after the
[1:19:30] high priest came out from behind the
[1:19:32] veil so the high priest came out after
[1:19:36] seven Church ages and when he came out
[1:19:39] it wasn't just another atonement now
[1:19:41] this was an atonement that also had
[1:19:44] another attachment if I want to use our
[1:19:47] daily days language had an attachment
[1:19:49] with the atonement sacrifice when the
[1:19:51] atonement himself was revealed the high
[1:19:53] priest was revealed this the jubilee
[1:19:57] trumpet was also accompanied now the
[1:20:00] jubilee trumpet and the atonement
[1:20:02] happened on the tenth day of the seventh
[1:20:05] month and I want to ask you a question
[1:20:10] what are the numbers is 10 7 revelation
[1:20:14] 10 7 what was that in the days of the
[1:20:18] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:20:22] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:20:23] finished
[1:20:23] what's he sounding he's sounding a
[1:20:25] jubilee trumpet to sit the bride free
[1:20:28] amen to sit her completely free from
[1:20:32] everything that is not of God everything
[1:20:36] and that's why we are on a journey that
[1:20:41] we are being completely set free of
[1:20:43] everything that's why we have trials
[1:20:46] that's why things come into our life
[1:20:49] that we don't want to happen but then in
[1:20:51] the end of it all we've realized man
[1:20:53] that was so good that there happen it
[1:20:54] might have been embarrassing to us or it
[1:20:57] might have been hurt it might have hurt
[1:20:59] us initially but it was the master
[1:21:02] swordsman it was the king and the divine
[1:21:05] physician and the scalpel of his word to
[1:21:08] perform an intricate operation on the
[1:21:10] heart because the jubilee trumpet has
[1:21:14] sounded because the high priest has
[1:21:17] revealed himself and our day amen to
[1:21:20] come in the person of Jesus Christ and
[1:21:26] then obviously you have the Feast of
[1:21:29] Tabernacles which is the seventh feast
[1:21:31] and that feast is the type of the
[1:21:33] Millennium
[1:21:38] so the returned in 63 that cloud took
[1:21:41] him up the cloud revealed his return the
[1:21:45] white work judge appears through
[1:21:47] revelation 10 7 and now I want to go to
[1:21:57] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:22:01] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:22:02] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:22:04] not prevent them which are asleep that
[1:22:06] preventers we shall not precede them we
[1:22:09] shall not bow before them they're going
[1:22:11] to come first and then we're going to
[1:22:13] come up together for the Lord Himself
[1:22:15] now here is the Lord himself shall
[1:22:18] descend from heaven with a shout Amen
[1:22:21] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[1:22:24] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:22:27] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:22:30] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:22:32] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[1:22:35] in the air but I thought the Lord
[1:22:37] Himself descended with a shout so here
[1:22:39] we had the Lord with us already and yet
[1:22:41] he's going to take us up to where to
[1:22:44] meet the Lord in the air so there is a
[1:22:46] dual revelation of God here there is a
[1:22:50] revelation where he has come yes he
[1:22:52] symbolically showed himself physically
[1:22:54] in a cloud but yet it was a spiritual
[1:22:56] revelation of the high priest it wasn't
[1:22:58] a physical corporal coming it was a
[1:23:01] spiritual reveal of Christ Himself who
[1:23:04] would come and reveal himself through
[1:23:06] the office of a prophet who would speak
[1:23:09] the word and lay out the seed through
[1:23:11] the jubilee trumpet saying freedom and
[1:23:13] he would preach a message that would
[1:23:15] give you your inheritance and seed for
[1:23:18] amen and then the Prophet would be taken
[1:23:21] away but the high priest would remain
[1:23:23] the the full complete Ministry of Christ
[1:23:26] would remain among the people to take
[1:23:28] what that seventh angel jubilee trumpet
[1:23:30] sounded and make it live and take what
[1:23:34] was in seed form and anoint of fivefold
[1:23:36] ministry to preach the seed form and
[1:23:39] open it and reveal it further and
[1:23:41] further and further that's why you will
[1:23:43] see the fivefold ministry has has grown
[1:23:46] it hasn't just been the same
[1:23:49] the understanding the revelation the
[1:23:52] personality of the fivefold ministry has
[1:23:55] become more like Christ because Christ
[1:23:57] is in those gifts operating those gifts
[1:23:59] operating in the people so that he
[1:24:03] himself would present her up in eternity
[1:24:08] back to himself again here you find the
[1:24:11] difference between time and eternity
[1:24:13] this is where Trinitarians get it all
[1:24:15] funny and mixed up they think that is
[1:24:17] two people but it's one person who
[1:24:20] reveals himself spiritually on the earth
[1:24:22] and time and yet he's still up there and
[1:24:24] he can communicate with that is eternal
[1:24:27] part of himself as much as we don't
[1:24:30] understand how that all works and we
[1:24:32] can't comprehend their that is what is
[1:24:34] going on there this is what's happening
[1:24:36] and this is exactly what we're reading
[1:24:39] here that the Lord himself shall descend
[1:24:41] with a shout with a message with a
[1:24:43] message to and a trumpet to shout to sit
[1:24:47] Rahab free to sin a bride free who was
[1:24:52] in corruption because he is the master
[1:24:58] over corruption and he this whole
[1:25:02] purpose for him to come this whole
[1:25:06] purpose because before he came the
[1:25:08] Pentecostal church the pinnacle of the
[1:25:11] revelation the pinnacle or the kiss
[1:25:13] restored was full of corruption full of
[1:25:16] even though they're in the perfect will
[1:25:18] of God in their day it was still full of
[1:25:20] corruption it was a lot of corruption in
[1:25:22] there amen
[1:25:23] if I may say this and I might get in
[1:25:27] trouble for this I hope not but if I may
[1:25:29] say this that even when the message
[1:25:32] first came the bribe was full of
[1:25:34] corruption and actually I can say this
[1:25:37] still my new forms of corruption inside
[1:25:39] but that's getting dealt with because
[1:25:41] the master over corruption is here to
[1:25:44] take those tiny little things that are
[1:25:46] so small and sometimes the smallest
[1:25:48] things are actually bigger things
[1:25:51] whether it's negative or positive you
[1:25:53] think you know and we we we look at our
[1:25:55] situation we look at the move of God and
[1:25:58] you know may God help me to just show
[1:26:01] you this is a magnificent event that's
[1:26:02] taking place
[1:26:03] and it seems so humble it seems so small
[1:26:05] we think it's going to be this
[1:26:06] prestigious thing that one of the
[1:26:08] greatest events
[1:26:09] Somoza sublime events in history it's
[1:26:13] taking place right now you know the one
[1:26:17] who hung on Calvary the one that
[1:26:19] purchased it all has returned to bring
[1:26:22] the people and prepare it and to take
[1:26:24] her into the sky and it's so humble and
[1:26:27] it's so small seemingly but the things
[1:26:30] that are so seemingly small can be
[1:26:33] massive can be major that's why the
[1:26:35] Bible says it's not despised the day of
[1:26:37] small things because when were in
[1:26:39] eternity when were in heaven we'll
[1:26:41] realize how major some of these things
[1:26:43] and we might think of a little decision
[1:26:45] that we've made or something that we've
[1:26:46] done and it just seems like it's just so
[1:26:48] insignificant but when you get there
[1:26:50] you're gonna realize how massive and how
[1:26:53] amazing how monumental and momentous
[1:26:55] these little things that God might just
[1:26:59] give you a little inspiration go do this
[1:27:01] and you go and do it and you don't feel
[1:27:03] nothing and then there's this butterfly
[1:27:05] effect that's changed the whole person's
[1:27:07] life just be obedient you know when God
[1:27:11] tells you to do something or he gives
[1:27:13] you an inspiration you might not think
[1:27:15] of it being very much just follow that
[1:27:18] voice follow Christ follow him he won't
[1:27:21] lead you astray Alleluia
[1:27:31] so here we have the two mentions of the
[1:27:33] Lord the spiritual revelation on the
[1:27:35] earth and the physical revelation and
[1:27:38] the ear because when we after all the
[1:27:40] corruption is dealt with all those
[1:27:42] little corrupt abilities inside after
[1:27:45] all that's been dealt with and we're
[1:27:46] ready and we and we and the dead in
[1:27:49] Christ rise up and together we are
[1:27:51] caught up into the into the air and we
[1:27:55] see him because we're in a glorified
[1:27:57] body we will be able to see the corporal
[1:28:01] body of Christ you know and we'll be
[1:28:03] able to enter into that realm of heaven
[1:28:06] and see these things clearly I'll give
[1:28:17] that for Billy so then as I a 38 16 to
[1:28:20] 17 it says because our deliverance from
[1:28:25] the pit of corruption Oh Lord by these
[1:28:28] things men live and in all these things
[1:28:31] as the life of my spirit so wilt thou
[1:28:34] recover me and make me to live behold
[1:28:37] for peace I had great bitterness but
[1:28:40] thou hast in love to my soul delivered
[1:28:45] it from the pit of corruption Oh
[1:28:47] hallelujah amen Oh what will we do about
[1:28:52] that love Alleluia that just makes me
[1:28:55] feel very thankful and so like you know
[1:28:58] you just feel helpless in a sense like
[1:29:00] you're just absolutely a hundred percent
[1:29:02] completely dependent on His mercy on his
[1:29:05] love towards you Amen you know it's at
[1:29:09] the Pharisees you had not the love of
[1:29:10] God in you that's why you can't receive
[1:29:11] me but there is a love that God has and
[1:29:17] he's placed it inside of us and that's
[1:29:19] why you can see him that's why when he
[1:29:21] does something you're seeing it because
[1:29:23] the love of God is in you
[1:29:25] Alleluia you're being connected to the
[1:29:27] very revelation of who he is what he's
[1:29:30] doing now
[1:29:36] the word corruption for thora
[1:29:41] as in the Greek decay that is ruin
[1:29:46] spontaneous or afflict inflicted
[1:29:48] literally or figuratively corruption
[1:29:50] destroy perish and in corruption our
[1:29:54] fourth hacia ather sia in corrupt
[1:30:00] in corruptibility generally unending
[1:30:03] existence figuratively genuineness
[1:30:07] immortality and corruption and sincerity
[1:30:12] real sincerity you know sincerity is you
[1:30:16] becoming dead to yourself completely and
[1:30:18] the very origin of your makeup the very
[1:30:22] that who you really are as expressed in
[1:30:25] your life now when I say who you really
[1:30:28] are not talking about your old nature
[1:30:30] now I'm talking about the one that was
[1:30:32] in God before the foundation of the
[1:30:34] world so we came from God and we're
[1:30:36] going back to God and because we came
[1:30:39] from God in the going back to God we
[1:30:46] that sincerity that God brings us to the
[1:30:51] true sincerity means that we our life
[1:30:54] becomes a clear representation of that
[1:30:55] now God we're born in corruption we've
[1:30:59] come into the world speaking lies and
[1:31:01] and we and all of these things but
[1:31:04] inside of us as a seed of and corruption
[1:31:06] inside of us is the love of God inside
[1:31:09] of us is that true person and when
[1:31:12] Christ comes and reveals himself to us
[1:31:14] what has whole intention is to is to
[1:31:17] speak over our lives and take us from a
[1:31:20] state of and corruption and bring us up
[1:31:22] a state of corruption and bring us up
[1:31:25] into a state of and corruption he wants
[1:31:28] to reveal himself in this in time
[1:31:31] personally to each one of us so that we
[1:31:34] can see a true man a true image of
[1:31:38] purity a true image lived before us so
[1:31:43] that we in our conscious and
[1:31:44] subconscious mind can behold that image
[1:31:48] behold that life
[1:31:50] it's not just an intellectual thing you
[1:31:53] can read the scriptures on an
[1:31:54] intellectual level and you might get
[1:31:56] good things and you might understand
[1:31:58] doctrines but there's a deeper level of
[1:32:01] reading the scripture and it is not an
[1:32:04] intellectual level it's a subconscious
[1:32:06] spiritual level that when you read a
[1:32:08] scripture there is an image there is a
[1:32:10] life from Genesis to Revelation there is
[1:32:13] a life that has been opened in the end
[1:32:16] time before it was open these were just
[1:32:19] stories
[1:32:19] these were just history it was even
[1:32:22] Christ was a historical idea - the
[1:32:25] denominational and to the classical
[1:32:29] understanding it was all a bit
[1:32:30] intellectual but then when it all came
[1:32:32] open and life now and this is what we're
[1:32:35] privileged to see this is the face of
[1:32:37] God it's his life that's his face
[1:32:40] shining like the sun shining on you in
[1:32:42] me so that now we reread the Bible we're
[1:32:46] not just reading stories where beholding
[1:32:49] a life an anointed eternal life that
[1:32:53] never ends and it's a power of an
[1:32:56] endless life in Christ that we behold
[1:32:58] and as we see that life on a deep on the
[1:33:02] deepest level of our existence we are
[1:33:06] being changed from glory to glory we are
[1:33:09] beholding an image and actually we are
[1:33:12] fearing an image we are carrying an
[1:33:16] image and that image is the image that
[1:33:19] we are beholding because the word is
[1:33:22] open the Bible is open the lives are
[1:33:25] open why are we seeing the lives of all
[1:33:28] these Old Testament characters it seems
[1:33:30] to be every story just starts to pour
[1:33:32] out a revelation of our hour and what we
[1:33:35] what's happening and tells us what's
[1:33:37] going to happen in the future and tells
[1:33:40] us all these things why is because their
[1:33:42] life came open and we're not just
[1:33:45] beholding the story anymore the
[1:33:46] revelation of a life has happened and
[1:33:49] it's changing us it's giving us
[1:33:52] rapturing faith because it's not only
[1:33:55] now what we're not just we're not just
[1:33:58] hid reading about stories now where
[1:34:00] there is a rapturing faith in the life
[1:34:02] that they are but
[1:34:04] who wrote the Bible God wrote the Bible
[1:34:07] but these people when you think meant ok
[1:34:10] so God you know he he orchestrated all
[1:34:12] their lives and he he sent our Ruth you
[1:34:15] must do this and you have to do that and
[1:34:16] then when you go there you must say all
[1:34:18] this and this is your lines you know and
[1:34:19] you have to do it all just like this
[1:34:21] because I'm writing a Bible here this is
[1:34:24] the Bible you know this is prophecy this
[1:34:26] is this is going to be accurate so you
[1:34:28] think now and now you know in an
[1:34:30] intellectual way you that's the only way
[1:34:31] you could do that but God and his
[1:34:33] manifold grace and understanding with
[1:34:36] never interfering with free will he all
[1:34:39] these lives all these people wrote
[1:34:42] intricate prophecy and accurate
[1:34:45] prophecies with their lives and their
[1:34:48] lives become the Bible the actions the
[1:34:51] reactions the decisions the successes
[1:34:54] the failures every part of their lives
[1:34:56] becomes the Bible and then and and you
[1:35:01] know and the time of Daniel Daniel
[1:35:03] starts breaking into the revelation of
[1:35:05] all this and gosse's seal it up to the
[1:35:07] time of the end seal it up Daniel
[1:35:09] because it's not the time for this to be
[1:35:11] known but then in the time of the end
[1:35:13] here comes the high priest himself after
[1:35:17] the earth has been filled with the smoke
[1:35:19] he'll had broken up in Revelation 9 and
[1:35:21] all the smoke and everything was all
[1:35:23] confused God Himself comes down the high
[1:35:27] priest has revealed from out of the veil
[1:35:29] of men's traditions men's traditions
[1:35:31] ahead it all sorted out like the
[1:35:33] Pharisees all sorted out this is how
[1:35:35] it's all going to be in the church was
[1:35:36] all structured and order and the
[1:35:38] Pentecostal church was denominating and
[1:35:39] it was all going its own way and then
[1:35:41] God comes amen and then the high priest
[1:35:44] comes amen
[1:35:45] not just comes to you know as a show not
[1:35:49] just to come to increase faith but to
[1:35:51] come with an open book come to with and
[1:35:56] it says his face was shining like the
[1:35:57] Sun how do we see that how does that
[1:36:00] come to us yes we can have a personal
[1:36:03] revelation and see a vision of Christ
[1:36:04] that's amazing and praise the Lord if
[1:36:06] that's the way he speaks to you but not
[1:36:08] everybody has that no and not everyone
[1:36:10] you know that's not a common thing but
[1:36:12] the common thing that everybody has as
[1:36:16] they have a Bible
[1:36:17] and now that Bible is not sealed anymore
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:21] God did not say seal it up anymore amen
[1:36:25] he says time to open amen and he opened
[1:36:28] it and all the lives now all those lives
[1:36:31] are now opened up and what are you
[1:36:33] beholding you'll be holding his face
[1:36:35] shining like a Sun and that's why you're
[1:36:37] going from glory to glory that's why
[1:36:39] you're under the influence of the
[1:36:41] Jubilee hallelujah you didn't just walk
[1:36:44] free when you heard that Jubilee you
[1:36:46] walking free you're always free you keep
[1:36:49] walking free I sing that song in my mind
[1:36:52] I walked free meaning I just keep
[1:36:54] walking free I'm just free amen because
[1:36:56] I'm under the influence of freedom I'm
[1:36:58] under the influence of the Liberty of
[1:37:00] God's Holy Spirit hallelujah because
[1:37:03] this is why he's coming this time amen
[1:37:06] and now the whole purpose you know sorry
[1:37:11] the main purpose not the hope if it's
[1:37:13] the main purpose is how you look at it
[1:37:16] is for this message for the Ministry of
[1:37:19] William Branham yes there was doctrinal
[1:37:23] stuff and everything like that and all
[1:37:24] the teaching and stuff but the main
[1:37:25] purpose was an introduction it was an
[1:37:28] introduction it came to introduce
[1:37:31] someone a man liked on the Baptist he
[1:37:34] introduced a lamb of God behold the lamb
[1:37:37] of God that taketh away the sin of the
[1:37:38] world and here in a meantime another of
[1:37:41] men anointed of the spiritual larger
[1:37:43] spirit Elijah behold the lamb of God
[1:37:45] which hung on Calvary which purchased
[1:37:48] you he's come to claim you now he's come
[1:37:50] to take you up he's come to prepare you
[1:37:52] he's come to reveal himself to you he's
[1:37:54] come with a jubilee trumpet to set you
[1:37:57] free from your old life - no matter how
[1:37:59] corrupt it's been no matter how hard
[1:38:01] it's been no matter how many hard trials
[1:38:03] no matter how much you've been crushed
[1:38:05] down to even a stub he's come to bring
[1:38:07] you back amen
[1:38:09] he's come to restore you completely
[1:38:11] hallelujah he's come to annihilate your
[1:38:14] old past amen right yes for thou has
[1:38:19] done love to my soul delivered it from
[1:38:22] the pit of corruption for thou has cast
[1:38:25] all my sins behind my back and you're so
[1:38:28] glad about that all my sins not the sum
[1:38:31] of them
[1:38:31] not just the ones that weren't so bad in
[1:38:34] your thinking but all of them amen
[1:38:36] this is the immutable Council of God and
[1:38:39] he swore by an oath that it would happen
[1:38:41] Amen hallelujah amen amen so in
[1:38:46] corruption sincerity hallelu genuineness
[1:38:49] immortality there's a genuineness in
[1:38:51] their endless life and that life has
[1:38:54] been on display to you so when you read
[1:38:56] the Bible you know you can read it
[1:38:57] please study it out through notes and do
[1:39:01] however you want to study it out and an
[1:39:03] intellectual if you want to do that's
[1:39:05] fine but there's another level that you
[1:39:07] can just enjoy just enjoy this level
[1:39:10] realize that when you're reading it now
[1:39:11] and this haven't helped me so much when
[1:39:14] you know the Lord showed me this and
[1:39:15] that I could read it and not get
[1:39:18] pressure to try and see something not
[1:39:20] get pressure to try and figure it out or
[1:39:22] see the type but just read it and go you
[1:39:25] know what that's open now I the lives
[1:39:28] are open and I'm just going to let the
[1:39:30] Bible bless me I'm going to let the life
[1:39:33] that's on display let that power of an
[1:39:36] endless life that face that shone like
[1:39:38] the Sun let it germinate the seeds in my
[1:39:41] life there's a power and he the person
[1:39:44] who is here who has opened at all who
[1:39:46] was standing there saying come and eat
[1:39:48] from my hand it's open here eat the book
[1:39:51] eat the word become part of the word
[1:39:52] that one you know just just just have
[1:39:56] that just enjoy it be in an atmosphere
[1:39:59] even if it's just five minutes enjoy it
[1:40:03] you'll get far more out of it than an
[1:40:06] hour of stress an hour of trying to
[1:40:08] study it out like you know we study in
[1:40:10] university and college and movie and
[1:40:12] we've got to really fire up the
[1:40:14] intellect you know and think you don't
[1:40:16] have to do that if you there's nothing
[1:40:20] wrong with doing that you're allowed to
[1:40:22] do that but that there is you know you
[1:40:24] you don't have to you know and you can
[1:40:27] enjoy both sides and I enjoy both sides
[1:40:29] you know sometimes I like to you know I
[1:40:31] can see something and I just write it
[1:40:33] all down and kind of lay it all out how
[1:40:35] at all I think it goes and this in in a
[1:40:39] lot of the times I just sit there and I
[1:40:40] just go Lord you know see it you said
[1:40:44] that if I look at
[1:40:45] hold the image of your life I'm going to
[1:40:47] be changed and so I just read the
[1:40:49] Gospels and I and I don't try and figure
[1:40:51] a real piece it together or see it how
[1:40:53] it's typed in our day or typed in the
[1:40:55] past I just want to read it and enjoy
[1:40:57] how you reacted to this and how you when
[1:41:01] they said this you did this and when
[1:41:03] that situation arose this is how you
[1:41:05] handled it and it's like a deep change
[1:41:07] inside me because it's open and it's not
[1:41:12] just open to a prophet it's not just
[1:41:14] it's open to Paul amen it's open for us
[1:41:17] to receive it's open because he has
[1:41:20] called John and rather been preached on
[1:41:22] it last week
[1:41:23] John types the bride put yourself in
[1:41:25] John's shoes John heard a voice which
[1:41:28] speaketh from heaven saying go and take
[1:41:30] the book out of the hands and eat it at
[1:41:33] a hence of the one that standing upon
[1:41:35] the sea and upon you so take the book
[1:41:37] out of the hands of the Lord Himself
[1:41:39] this is our relationship we we don't you
[1:41:46] know we don't put brother Branham in
[1:41:48] front of our relationship you know with
[1:41:51] Christ now people think that when they
[1:41:53] look out what Kahana they think that
[1:41:54] he's like this you know his message the
[1:41:57] truth that he preached the introduction
[1:41:59] we couldn't have that without that
[1:42:01] that's all part of it but the the very
[1:42:05] relationship the very that our whole
[1:42:08] life as as we've been introduced if we
[1:42:12] if we haven't been introduced and all we
[1:42:14] see as a messenger then that's exactly
[1:42:16] what they're people you know think about
[1:42:18] it you know they think oh you're in a
[1:42:20] cult and you're doing these things
[1:42:21] because you're following us man and
[1:42:23] there are people that would be in that
[1:42:24] situation where all they see is a
[1:42:26] messenger but they haven't actually been
[1:42:28] introduced to the one he came to
[1:42:30] introduce but we have been introduced
[1:42:32] amen the purpose of the of the elijah
[1:42:36] ministry was to introduce the Lamb of
[1:42:39] God amen
[1:42:40] introduced the one who created the earth
[1:42:42] the one who spoken the planets came in
[1:42:45] amen
[1:42:46] the one who spoke to Abraham the one
[1:42:48] that spoke to all the prophets are
[1:42:49] revealed and so for all those the one
[1:42:50] that hung on Calvary as our friend we've
[1:42:55] been introduced to him
[1:42:56] he's come out of history he's no longer
[1:42:59] yes he is the history
[1:43:00] he's it's his story you know that he's
[1:43:03] and he's the future but we've been
[1:43:05] introduced to the person to him the
[1:43:07] present you know the Jesus is rebuking
[1:43:10] the Pharisees and this is maybe a
[1:43:13] slightly different angle on the
[1:43:15] scripture that I believe this is the
[1:43:17] right angle and Georgia be happy because
[1:43:19] you know George is very you know
[1:43:21] particular about these things and it's
[1:43:23] he says to the Pharisees you search the
[1:43:25] Scriptures and earn them you think you
[1:43:28] have eternal life and you don't come to
[1:43:30] me what he says he sang to them you're
[1:43:36] searching the letter and you're getting
[1:43:38] so involved in the letter and you
[1:43:39] figured it all out and you sink your
[1:43:40] eternal life as and you're studying of
[1:43:42] this letter and you're not even coming
[1:43:45] you don't come to me brother branham
[1:43:48] mentioned many times on his message to
[1:43:50] know him as life he never said but he
[1:43:54] didn't say no and don't study the word
[1:43:55] and don't have that basis in your life
[1:43:57] he's but-but-but the purpose the
[1:44:00] revelation of the word of him he is the
[1:44:03] word he is the full revelation of it
[1:44:04] Amen hallelujah glory amen
[1:44:12] it's all in Spanish now
[1:44:19] 1 Corinthians 15 verse 47 to 49
[1:44:23] oh sorry 51 to 53 behold I show you a
[1:44:26] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[1:44:28] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[1:44:30] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[1:44:33] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[1:44:35] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[1:44:39] shall be changed for this corruptible
[1:44:43] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[1:44:46] must put on immortality amen so there's
[1:44:51] two like events taking place it is and
[1:44:53] there's corruption putting on in
[1:44:55] corruption and then there's mortal
[1:44:56] putting on immortality so this so
[1:44:58] there's a spiritual change that's
[1:45:01] happening now where the corruptible is
[1:45:03] putting on in corruption because you're
[1:45:05] holding an image you're seeing a life
[1:45:07] expressed in the Bible and in reality
[1:45:09] because the Bible the message everything
[1:45:11] that's been happened and being spoken
[1:45:13] today has to put on flesh excuse me so
[1:45:16] you're seeing it we're now beholding
[1:45:19] that and and and we're going from glory
[1:45:22] to glory to glory because we're
[1:45:25] beholding him and his fullness amen
[1:45:29] and that word born is to have a burden
[1:45:34] to wear as clothing or a constant
[1:45:38] accompaniment it's for real to have a
[1:45:45] burden that is by analogy to wear as
[1:45:47] clothing or a constant accompaniment the
[1:45:50] image you're putting on an image this is
[1:45:56] taking place now this is the this the
[1:45:59] image is the very complete view it's the
[1:46:04] very image that you've beheld all your
[1:46:06] life and maybe you know we didn't start
[1:46:08] off on a good note
[1:46:09] you know our parents lived a certain
[1:46:11] image in front of us they were a certain
[1:46:13] way our nation presented a certain
[1:46:15] culture to us Hollywood just came in a
[1:46:17] cancer and just filled us with an image
[1:46:20] that if we watch TV you know and and and
[1:46:22] and you beheld the stuff and you became
[1:46:24] that's who you think you are the image
[1:46:28] is who you think you are it's who you
[1:46:29] are
[1:46:30] deep it's a deep I don't even know how
[1:46:33] to
[1:46:33] you know what I mean it's and and and
[1:46:35] whatever you beheld is what you became
[1:46:38] and then and you can see now many people
[1:46:44] even Christianity christened them if
[1:46:47] they'd not be holding this image of the
[1:46:50] Bible of the word the full revelation of
[1:46:52] Jesus Christ the one that's got the open
[1:46:54] book that's coming has face shining like
[1:46:56] the Sun to combat that to smoke out of
[1:46:58] the pit that one if they're not holding
[1:47:01] their watch what we have images look at
[1:47:04] the image of their lives
[1:47:05] it's the images Hollywood the images
[1:47:08] heavy metal the images rap music it's in
[1:47:10] the churches it's everywhere it's
[1:47:11] through the world because they were
[1:47:12] holding an image that's who they are but
[1:47:14] we are beholding a different image we
[1:47:17] are beholding an eternal image we are
[1:47:19] beholding a heavily culture and we are
[1:47:22] becoming like that because we're looking
[1:47:24] at that we're seeing that we're hearing
[1:47:26] that it's going into all our senses our
[1:47:29] five senses are getting you know the
[1:47:31] eardrums are vibrating with the
[1:47:33] vibration of heavenly culture heavenly
[1:47:35] language amen
[1:47:37] we're hearing this stuff and it's on a
[1:47:38] deeper level we don't might not
[1:47:40] understand everything will follow
[1:47:41] everything but there's a heavenly
[1:47:43] language coming in and it's going into
[1:47:45] our spirit it's seeping into our heart
[1:47:46] and it's infiltrating every part of our
[1:47:49] life amen
[1:47:50] it's getting down deep into the nitty
[1:47:52] gritty stuff and changing us and helping
[1:47:54] us and raising up a standard and it's
[1:47:56] causing a revolution to take place
[1:47:58] within our lives that's why we're going
[1:48:00] through the trial that's why we're
[1:48:01] having a hard time because these things
[1:48:03] have to be filtered out pushed out
[1:48:05] that's why we get sick because we need
[1:48:08] to find out who's the rahova Ruffo you
[1:48:10] know who's our healer and and maybe that
[1:48:12] we start to contemplate things a bit
[1:48:14] more when we get sick or when we go
[1:48:16] through something we started look and
[1:48:18] think on things and we've been we see in
[1:48:20] the word and we find something in there
[1:48:22] and it opens up to us and and and we
[1:48:25] behold that life that's on display and
[1:48:27] their image we start to carry and no
[1:48:32] longer do we carry an image of this
[1:48:34] earth no longer do we carry an image of
[1:48:36] Hollywood an image that Satan has
[1:48:38] constructed to pull humans from the
[1:48:41] economy of God but we're beholding an
[1:48:44] image and we're wearing a new image
[1:48:47] hallelujah and WIC corruption is going
[1:48:51] to put on incorruption and it's putting
[1:48:53] it on it says put off the old man in his
[1:48:56] works and put me on Jesus Christ where
[1:48:59] that image behold that image
[1:49:03] hallelujah Amy yep that's right and in 1
[1:49:08] Corinthians 15 47 to 49 it says the
[1:49:11] first man is of the earth earthy swim
[1:49:14] Adam the second man is the lord from
[1:49:16] heaven as is the earthy such are they
[1:49:19] also that are earthy and as is the
[1:49:22] heavenly such are they also that are
[1:49:24] heavenly and as we have borne the image
[1:49:26] of the earthly we shall also bear the
[1:49:28] image of the heavenly
[1:49:33] 2 Corinthians 3:16 - 18 it says
[1:49:36] nevertheless now this is a key here and
[1:49:40] I've underlined this I think so
[1:49:43] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[1:49:49] Lord this is like you know when it shall
[1:49:55] turn to the Lord there's a time you know
[1:49:58] where you know man kind of had a bit of
[1:50:00] control here and they were figuring it
[1:50:02] all out then one day God comes on the
[1:50:04] scene you know one day the high priest
[1:50:06] is revealed again and one day he sticks
[1:50:08] out from behind the veil and mentions
[1:50:09] this is time shall be no law I'm not
[1:50:11] going to delay this anymore I'm going to
[1:50:12] come and I'm going to go right into the
[1:50:14] fire that these people are in and I'm
[1:50:16] going to save them from the fire I'm
[1:50:18] gonna save them from Babylon I'm gonna
[1:50:20] save them from all the corruption that's
[1:50:22] ruled Azzam and they're going to be
[1:50:23] immune from it so that they can
[1:50:25] fellowship with me in the middle of it
[1:50:26] all and that's exactly a situation we
[1:50:30] are in perfect fellowship with Christ
[1:50:31] now people will lie to you all day long
[1:50:33] trying to pull you out of it
[1:50:35] but you are in perfect fellowship and if
[1:50:38] you do so wrong you just repent and
[1:50:40] you're still in perfect fellowship you
[1:50:42] don't have to grovel back or try and
[1:50:44] earn your way back you're back the
[1:50:46] moment you repeat in the moment you make
[1:50:47] it right just make it right you don't
[1:50:49] have to spend time and make it all up on
[1:50:52] a figlio human level we do that you know
[1:50:54] we have to you know get it's a process
[1:50:57] but for God it's not a process because
[1:50:59] the power of that blood
[1:51:01] as enough for perfect fellowship amen
[1:51:04] hallelujah so and it say here and that
[1:51:09] there's going to come a time now where
[1:51:11] he says it's going to turn back to the
[1:51:14] Lord he's going to turn back and I
[1:51:15] believe they were in that season where
[1:51:17] it's tuned to the Lord and that he is
[1:51:20] dealing personally now in a complete way
[1:51:23] he's not holding anything back of
[1:51:25] himself he's giving all of himself he
[1:51:28] has come and his fullness of his
[1:51:30] presence to reveal himself to you when
[1:51:35] it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall
[1:51:38] be taken away amen and we know that the
[1:51:41] veil has been taken away and we're now
[1:51:43] seeing his face and that face is shining
[1:51:47] like the Sun yes yes the schmuck came up
[1:51:50] out of the pit and has blocked the Sun
[1:51:52] off to the world but then you know what
[1:51:54] the Lord said see I'm just going to come
[1:51:56] personally to my bride then Satan's not
[1:51:59] going to block my face amen
[1:52:01] Satan knew that one day it will turn to
[1:52:04] the Lord and so you know what he did he
[1:52:06] got permission somehow and he got the
[1:52:08] pit to open up and they're all spewed
[1:52:09] out after world war two during and
[1:52:12] around that time how opened up on the
[1:52:14] earth around that era and that's why you
[1:52:16] see the full advancement of science and
[1:52:18] the full advancement of technology and
[1:52:20] TVs and the things that Satan can use to
[1:52:23] to destroy humanity communication was
[1:52:26] really something that has really you
[1:52:30] know it's been a hindrance to the two
[1:52:31] faiths because Satan is now able to
[1:52:34] easily convey his message across the
[1:52:36] earth very quickly like the speed of
[1:52:39] light the veil shall be taken away now
[1:52:43] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[1:52:45] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:52:47] but we all with open face beholding as
[1:52:50] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:52:53] changed into the same image from glory
[1:52:56] to glory even as by the Spirit of the
[1:52:58] Lord not by might nor by power but by my
[1:53:01] spirit saith the Lord that's not by
[1:53:03] something that you earn or something
[1:53:04] that you you achieve it's not our
[1:53:07] achievement it's his achievement it's
[1:53:08] achieved it's finished he spoke and he
[1:53:11] said it's they're going to be delayed no
[1:53:12] longer I'm here and I'm bringing you up
[1:53:15] to your heavenly position or just humble
[1:53:17] yourself humble yourself under the
[1:53:19] mighty hand of God he shall exalt you in
[1:53:21] due time now now the bride is humble and
[1:53:24] she doesn't want to just make herself
[1:53:25] anything but you see you the position
[1:53:29] you started life in and the position
[1:53:31] that God has ordained for you as an
[1:53:32] exultation your exalted to a position
[1:53:35] your exalted to an office to a calling
[1:53:39] to your position as an eternal part of
[1:53:42] God because you were a nurse thinking
[1:53:44] before the world even began you were
[1:53:46] part of us thinking and then you came on
[1:53:48] the earth and then finally he can exalt
[1:53:51] you up to that position that he saw you
[1:53:52] as before the world even began now you
[1:53:56] now to get there you can't force his way
[1:53:57] there David never forced himself on the
[1:54:00] throne he just worked with the Lord he
[1:54:02] praised the Lord he went through all the
[1:54:04] trials it looked like it was completely
[1:54:05] going the opposite direction
[1:54:07] he never forced him something never he
[1:54:09] had many opportunities to take the
[1:54:10] throne and he never took it without the
[1:54:13] Lord and his time and that's why he just
[1:54:17] humbled himself under the mighty hand of
[1:54:18] God that God would exalt him in due time
[1:54:20] and put him on the throne at the right
[1:54:22] season to put him in his position where
[1:54:25] Israel could be blessed because when he
[1:54:27] was in his position he may be too early
[1:54:28] at what the blessing would have missed
[1:54:30] to earlier this God has a sheet music
[1:54:33] the great concert oh and there is a
[1:54:35] season for everything is a season for
[1:54:37] your victories there's a season for you
[1:54:39] to come right up on top of all of your
[1:54:42] old nature completely so don't be
[1:54:44] discouraged if you feel like you know my
[1:54:46] old nature gets the better of me too
[1:54:47] much and I go through it we all go
[1:54:50] through it with the old nature you think
[1:54:52] and I just haven't gotten anywhere but
[1:54:54] you have the honors dealing you know
[1:54:56] it's all will be the throne in the right
[1:54:59] time and then the David that you'll come
[1:55:01] fully into your position completely over
[1:55:03] all those things it's going to happen
[1:55:05] amen God swore by an oath by himself
[1:55:11] then it would happen amen the veil of
[1:55:18] men's traditional shall be taken away by
[1:55:20] who by revelation 10 the mighty angel
[1:55:26] the Lord Himself an angelic form
[1:55:28] the corruption we were born under as
[1:55:29] being shaken by the voice that john
[1:55:31] heard john heard that voice john heard
[1:55:34] what those seven thunders actually said
[1:55:36] because remember john types the bride
[1:55:38] john heard what they after he heard the
[1:55:41] information the the mystery that they
[1:55:44] were he heard that and he was about to
[1:55:45] write it all down and go seize seal it
[1:55:47] up john seal it and he wrote it in a
[1:55:52] simple form and and and and and and you
[1:55:58] have some hearing a thunder and some
[1:56:01] hearing a voice and then because john
[1:56:05] heard that and was told to seal it up
[1:56:07] it's the same for you the john types the
[1:56:10] bride and and and it's been given to you
[1:56:13] to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:56:14] it's been given to you for these things
[1:56:16] to be revealed to you because in that
[1:56:19] life as I said before is going to be
[1:56:22] your rapture and faith is going to be
[1:56:23] your identity that's why you read all
[1:56:25] these stories and the characters and
[1:56:27] everything and you see oh this is my Who
[1:56:28] I am I am this I was this and I've
[1:56:31] become this just like Rahab just like
[1:56:33] roof just like Abigail just like
[1:56:35] Bathsheba just like all these people in
[1:56:37] the Bible just like David just like all
[1:56:39] of these people you can see now it's all
[1:56:41] opened up it's because John heard the
[1:56:45] voice and you had just like John but
[1:56:49] what John was told to seal it up
[1:56:51] you're also told to seal it up inside
[1:56:52] you it's sealed and within you and it's
[1:56:56] a secret Ministry of the Seventh Seal
[1:56:58] himself which is Christ the return of
[1:57:00] Christ that high priest that came and
[1:57:03] availed himself and revealed himself in
[1:57:05] the cloud and has come down as to come
[1:57:08] and be intimately involved in our
[1:57:09] affairs in our lives to bring us up as
[1:57:11] the seventh seal that's the that's the
[1:57:14] return of Christ to the earth it's the
[1:57:16] coming of the Lord and and and before he
[1:57:18] comes in the corporal he has to come in
[1:57:20] and bring her bride out of Satan's Eden
[1:57:24] just like Satan came into God's Eden and
[1:57:27] took away the Adams bride
[1:57:29] God comes into Satan's Eden takes away
[1:57:31] what Lucifer's trying to destroy and
[1:57:34] take out Jesus bride and restore her
[1:57:36] back to what she should be and bring her
[1:57:39] right out of the darkest age that he's
[1:57:40] ever been the most corruption
[1:57:42] that has ever been all the CERN
[1:57:44] everything is all everywhere
[1:57:45] it's a Babylonian fire burning around
[1:57:48] every life but because of the fellowship
[1:57:50] of the one that's come down into the
[1:57:53] earth the seventh seal himself Christ
[1:57:55] coming down every time you see Christ
[1:57:57] coming down into the affairs of people
[1:58:00] that is a revelation and type of the
[1:58:02] seventh seal that's why the prophets
[1:58:03] said this revelation is a secret but he
[1:58:06] gives you a key there and he says but
[1:58:08] it's actually revealed in every type of
[1:58:10] description and in every type of the
[1:58:12] scripture you'll see God comes out of
[1:58:15] heaven down into the earth to do
[1:58:16] something comes down and eat and he
[1:58:18] comes down to know he comes down to the
[1:58:20] three and the fire he comes down you
[1:58:22] know he comes down to change situations
[1:58:25] of people that believe in him amen he
[1:58:28] comes down to to interfere with
[1:58:30] something that's going the wrong
[1:58:31] direction and it needs to go a certain
[1:58:33] way then God comes amen hallelujah man
[1:58:37] was going in a very bad direction and
[1:58:39] the Pharisees and all of the religions
[1:58:40] go wrong so God came amen he came down
[1:58:43] and he purchased our salvation and he
[1:58:46] took the corruption itself amen and he
[1:58:49] displayed his mastery over corruption
[1:58:51] amen you know he displayed that he
[1:58:55] displayed that was Lazarus and he turned
[1:58:57] a rotten body into a brand-new body
[1:58:59] again and he called him back from
[1:59:00] corruption and that wasn't enough he
[1:59:03] actually died on Calvary and he took
[1:59:05] corruption and he pulled and he ripped
[1:59:07] it out of hell and he took and he went
[1:59:10] down into corruption itself the very
[1:59:12] root of corruption down into hell and he
[1:59:14] destroyed it amen
[1:59:16] he took the keys he took the control
[1:59:18] that corruption had over people he took
[1:59:20] the power of death and he cut severed
[1:59:22] its time so that we could have life
[1:59:25] because he is the abolish ur of death
[1:59:28] he's the abolish ur of corruption he's
[1:59:30] the abolish ur of decay and for seven
[1:59:35] church ages people still went down the
[1:59:38] way of the grave because the fullness
[1:59:40] that last little but that the Apostles
[1:59:43] were aiming for and relaxed and that
[1:59:45] church ended up going underground and
[1:59:47] then started getting restored to me
[1:59:48] finally at the end time that last cog
[1:59:51] which is the fullness of Christ the
[1:59:53] person the abolish ur of death
[1:59:56] self would come to a people so that they
[1:59:59] wouldn't even die ever
[2:00:00] now that is the fullness of Christ
[2:00:03] that's the last call this so that a
[2:00:04] people could be raptured as that
[2:00:06] revelation of the very person of Christ
[2:00:09] amen
[2:00:10] so that all the corruption that would
[2:00:12] make you die it's going to be dealt with
[2:00:14] and that's why we're here that's why
[2:00:17] when we read the Bible just enjoy it
[2:00:18] because the abolish of corruption is
[2:00:21] with you and he'll help you read the
[2:00:23] Bible he will speak to you from those
[2:00:25] pages amen you don't have to strive and
[2:00:27] struggle to try and understand it all he
[2:00:30] will give you understanding because he's
[2:00:31] the abolish ur of corruption amen he
[2:00:34] turns corruption into incur up ssin amen
[2:00:37] so that you can wear the image of his
[2:00:40] person where his life and we're all a
[2:00:43] work in progress and those of you that
[2:00:45] know me well and know that I'm a big
[2:00:47] work in progress that we're working amen
[2:00:50] God is working God is moving and we're
[2:00:52] developing because he is here amen
[2:00:55] hallelujah I look at my friends and I
[2:00:58] don't want to compare myself with people
[2:01:00] but I look at my friends that doing
[2:01:02] their own thing and they've got their
[2:01:04] own form of religion in there they are
[2:01:06] Christians and they all see them there
[2:01:08] one day I believe a fear if they really
[2:01:11] trust in Christ but their life is not
[2:01:14] going the same direction as else their
[2:01:16] life was getting worse than they're
[2:01:18] getting worldly and they're drinking and
[2:01:19] they're doing all the stuff because
[2:01:22] they're not be holding that cog that
[2:01:24] we've got that's making us retro ready
[2:01:25] that fall whatever that last thing is
[2:01:29] that the Apostles were aiming for where
[2:01:32] they said now we see darkly but then
[2:01:34] we'll see him as he is we're seeing him
[2:01:36] as he is because he stepped forth from
[2:01:39] behind the veil of mass tradition and
[2:01:41] corruption knows its master he is he has
[2:01:45] mastery over it and so all those little
[2:01:47] corrupt things in our life that make it
[2:01:49] out make relationships get worse if you
[2:01:51] spend too much time with somebody you
[2:01:52] end up becoming better and more
[2:01:54] character and you become a better person
[2:01:57] you know you look at people and you look
[2:01:59] at people that are outside of the
[2:02:01] economy of what we have and you and you
[2:02:04] see they you know oftentimes become
[2:02:07] worse off they become worse people as
[2:02:09] they get old
[2:02:09] they get crab it and they get angry and
[2:02:12] they get like you know and they become
[2:02:13] cynical and they just become negative
[2:02:16] people because they're not have the cog
[2:02:19] they don't have that final masterpiece
[2:02:21] the stone which the builders rejected
[2:02:24] the headstone himself he is the one that
[2:02:28] tends that the corruption to
[2:02:30] incorruption so we know and this is not
[2:02:34] in my notes at all but you know the you
[2:02:36] know how Daniel whenever Kinnear had the
[2:02:37] dream and he Nebuchadnezzar had the
[2:02:43] dream and Daniel interprets the dream
[2:02:46] any any any and basically he sees that
[2:02:49] big image that beast and it's a Babylon
[2:02:51] and in Medes and Persians and in the
[2:02:53] Grecian Empire and then the Roman Empire
[2:02:56] in symbolic form and then he sees this
[2:02:58] little stone cut out of the mountains
[2:03:00] and it grows bigger and bigger and fills
[2:03:02] the whole earth and then it's mites that
[2:03:05] image at the feet and the whole image
[2:03:07] it's blasted that Babylonian satanic
[2:03:10] Kingdom of Gentile world powers as
[2:03:14] completely broken by that stone and
[2:03:17] that's that stone that's that headstone
[2:03:19] next Christ the fullness of Christ
[2:03:21] Himself that capstone that was rejected
[2:03:24] off the temple home Christ that's the
[2:03:29] very stone the only stone the the key
[2:03:32] stone to a full complete victory over
[2:03:36] this that's the key stone for the
[2:03:39] rapture and that's Christ what is that
[2:03:40] what happens he comes into this earth he
[2:03:45] gets cut out without hands and he gets
[2:03:47] revealed to you it's a stone of
[2:03:48] Revelation and he comes in and what does
[2:03:51] he do he starts growing and pushing it
[2:03:53] pushes out all the corruption pushes out
[2:03:55] more and more gets bigger and bigger
[2:03:57] he's bigger you keep feeding on the word
[2:03:59] like a tree you eat drink more than you
[2:04:01] need a mint just keep feeding somehow
[2:04:04] you know enjoy it and just gets bigger
[2:04:06] and bigger until he fills the whole
[2:04:07] earth and then he rises up and that
[2:04:10] Babylonian image that you were born
[2:04:11] under he strikes it right at the feet
[2:04:14] and everything that you thought that was
[2:04:16] your enemy and all that all nature
[2:04:18] everything just gets destroyed
[2:04:21] completely destroyed a man can I have
[2:04:24] the musicians please because he has come
[2:04:28] amen
[2:04:30] mastery over corruption Mary we know the
[2:04:46] story of Lazarus Lazarus
[2:04:50] you know when Lazarus was dead here you
[2:04:53] have Mary and she's crying and she's
[2:04:57] upset and Jesus you know the fullness of
[2:05:02] the word he was the fullness of the word
[2:05:04] and he had been revealed in their day
[2:05:06] and he he had not revealed himself he
[2:05:09] had not shown himself to Mary at this
[2:05:11] stage and she was upset and Lazarus is
[2:05:14] dead
[2:05:14] but Martha had gone out to meet him and
[2:05:16] there Martha comes back to Mary and says
[2:05:22] the master has come and calls for thee
[2:05:25] and that's the type of us in our day
[2:05:28] because you see you know brother Branham
[2:05:31] said that if Jesus didn't put less or us
[2:05:32] in front of that when he spoke come
[2:05:34] forth the whole everyone that ever died
[2:05:36] would have just raised up and you've
[2:05:38] been every human on the earth now one
[2:05:42] day because he was just showing that in
[2:05:43] type but now here in the end time you
[2:05:46] have the fullness of the word that's
[2:05:47] been restored and he is in a secret
[2:05:49] place that wasn't revealed in the
[2:05:51] scripture where he was but he was just
[2:05:52] out and he wasn't revealed to the whole
[2:05:55] all the people but Martha had received
[2:05:58] the revelation of him Martha knew what
[2:06:00] was going on and she had come into
[2:06:02] connection with the resurrection and the
[2:06:04] life fullness of the resurrection in the
[2:06:06] life he was and so here she's a type of
[2:06:09] the church and she's going now to her
[2:06:12] sister and she's saying the master has
[2:06:14] come and calls for thee go out to meet
[2:06:17] him and Mary went out a minimun secret
[2:06:20] and after she met him then he speaks and
[2:06:23] their general resurrection that
[2:06:24] resurrection takes place and so we're
[2:06:27] arrived at that season where we've been
[2:06:30] called up the master has come and he
[2:06:32] calls for you
[2:06:34] he's calling for you to go out and meet
[2:06:36] them in your secret place
[2:06:37] enjoy your relationship with them have
[2:06:40] fellowship with them don't stress don't
[2:06:43] get all Restless about it and tight
[2:06:46] about it just enjoy it
[2:06:47] because his company is called for thee
[2:06:49] you might be crying down you know you
[2:06:51] can see all your people of the past the
[2:06:53] type of Lazarus they did in the tombs
[2:06:55] they're really they're gonna be dead the
[2:06:57] dead in Christ will rise but he's come
[2:06:59] and he calls for thee because he's about
[2:07:00] ready to speak and cause a resurrection
[2:07:03] to take place a man he's about ready
[2:07:05] brother Branham says this sorry I'm just
[2:07:08] gonna write these out just so you can
[2:07:10] realize I just want don't worry about it
[2:07:13] it's all good he says here these are
[2:07:17] sermons right these are sermon title and
[2:07:19] I want to show you that you know brother
[2:07:20] Branham preached sermons and they were
[2:07:22] not like my sermons and and our sermons

[2:08:29] the time and they're so like it it has
[2:08:31] to be revealed it can't just be an
[2:08:33] intellectual and catch it
