[4:17] &gt;&gt; So, we're very uh
[4:20] uh I was going to say spoiled, but I'll
[4:21] say blessed at at in this fellowship
[4:23] because we have um essentially have
[4:25] three bands. So, if one whole band is
[4:27] not there, we got another band to call
[4:28] on then we then we got another band
[4:30] after that. Here we go. So, so today we
[4:33] actually have a but today the the youth
[4:36] are going to be playing today. So, we've
[4:37] got like you notice there's all new
[4:39] people there apart from
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Jimmy.
[4:43] He's still a youth. Yeah. So, so this is
[4:46] this is quite a big moment for them. But
[4:49] um you know and the Lord he he helps us
[4:53] and trains us and grows us and you know
[4:56] that's that. So we try and do the same
[4:58] thing with the with the youth in our
[5:00] church. You know, the Bible says, "Do
[5:01] not despise the day of small things."
[5:04] Not that this is a small thing. You
[5:05] know, sometimes when something starts,
[5:06] you think, "Oh, let's, you know,
[5:08] whatever it is, but you know, we all
[5:11] start somewhere." So, yeah. But they're
[5:12] going to be great. They're all They're

[8:00] Well, my mama told a story from the
[8:03] Bible long ago about Shadrach, Meack,
[8:08] and Obedo.
[8:10] How the wicked king commanded they be
[8:13] thrown into the flame because they would
[8:17] not bow and then deny their father's
[8:20] name.
[8:22] Mama said the king stood high upon a
[8:25] balcony so tall. And when he looked up,
[8:29] he was shocked by all the things he saw.
[8:32] Cuz he thought that he
[8:35] laying dead upon the ground. But instead
[8:38] of three, he counted four walking all
[8:41] around.
[8:43] Then I said, "Mama, wait a minute.
[8:46] There's one thing that I must know. The
[8:49] three went in, the tree came out. Then
[8:52] where did that fourth man go? And I
[8:54] never will forget it. Mama danced across
[8:58] the floor. And these were the words I
[9:00] heard her say while shouting through the
[9:03] door. Well, she said, "He's still in the
[9:07] fire and he's walking in flame and he'll
[9:11] be there to help you when you call upon
[9:14] his name. And he can still deliver by
[9:18] his almighty power here below. It's good
[9:22] to know he's still in the fire.
[9:26] Oh my friend, you may be destined to
[9:29] face life's hottest flame. But I'm glad
[9:32] that I can tell you through the power of
[9:35] his name. Not one flame of fire will
[9:38] touch you. You'll come through it and
[9:40] you'll tell. Yesterday, today, forever,
[9:44] God is still alive. And well,
[9:48] well, he's still in the fire and he's
[9:51] walking in the flame. And he'll be there
[9:54] to help you when you call upon his name.
[9:58] And he can still deliver by his almighty
[10:02] power. While here below, it's good to
[10:05] know he's still in He's still in the
[10:08] fire. He's still in the fire. And he's
[10:12] walking in the flame. And he will be
[10:15] there to help you when you call upon his
[10:18] name. And he can still deliver by it.
[10:23] Almighty power. While he below, it's
[10:26] good to know he still in the fire.
[10:31] While here below, it's good to know he's
[10:34] still in the fire.
[10:37] While here below, it's good to know he's
[10:42] still in the fire.
[10:46] Amen.
[10:49] Amen. Regardless of what fire it is,
[10:51] regardless of how hot it is, you can
[10:52] take your seats. Um this morning, we've

[33:09] three specials there one after the other
[33:12] were speaking about mountains
[33:16] and
[33:17] it seems to be each camp has a different
[33:20] theme but this one seems to be that the
[33:23] this mountain moving theme
[33:26] running through it.
[33:28] And there's three things that
[33:33] we
[33:35] can understand about a mountain.
[33:38] The first thing about a mountain is that
[33:40] it's been there for a long time.
[33:44] And the second thing is it's very big.
[33:47] And the third thing is it's supposedly
[33:49] unmovable.
[33:53] But not today.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Not this season.
[33:58] This is mountain moving season.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what is in your life.
[34:02] It doesn't matter how big it is.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how long it's been
[34:06] there for.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; If you want it to move, it's going to
[34:10] move.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; It's mountain moving season.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand this morning and just
[34:17] sing some worship songs before we call
[34:18] up brother John.
[34:20] Brother John, we deposited a lot of
[34:22] money in your bank, too. So, you're
[34:24] you're back up to you're in the millions
[34:26] for this morning's service, brother.
[34:30] You got money in the bank.

[34:53] Further stormy
[34:56] sea.
[34:58] The waves are crashing over and the
[35:02] daylight hides its face from me. Fear is
[35:07] true and the storm
[35:11] agrees.
[35:13] But I look and I see who's in the boat
[35:19] with me. Jesus,
[35:24] you're here.
[35:28] There is nothing that I need to fear.
[35:36] You're here.
[35:38] [Music]
[35:40] You're here.
[35:43] There is nothing that I need to fear.
[35:51] Oh, there is nothing that I need to feel
[35:59] because Jesus
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] is here.
[36:08] Waves, you won't break me.
[36:12] Storm, you won't shake me.
[36:16] Jesus
[36:19] is here.
[36:21] [Music]
[36:23] Are ye tempest, you will all be still.
[36:28] [Music]
[36:31] Peace
[36:35] be still.
[36:38] Oh, peace
[36:43] be still. Of
[36:47] times I've sailed through life's stormy
[36:52] gale
[36:54] and the situations
[36:57] are proclaiming you will not prevail.
[37:01] But your word says thou ruest
[37:06] the raging of the sea.
[37:09] When the waves
[37:11] arrive,
[37:13] he is still there.
[37:16] Jesus,
[37:20] you're here.
[37:24] There is nothing that I need to feel.
[37:32] You're here.
[37:35] You're here.
[37:39] There is nothing that I need here.
[37:46] There is nothing that I need to fear
[37:51] because Jesus is here.
[37:55] Jesus
[37:56] [Music]
[37:58] is here.
[38:02] Waves you won't break me.
[38:06] Storm you won't shake me.
[38:10] Jesus
[38:13] is here.
[38:16] Oh ye tempest you will all be still.
[38:25] Peace
[38:27] [Music]
[38:28] be still.
[38:31] Oh, peace.
[38:35] Be still. And in your darkest, in your
[38:40] darkest
[38:42] hour,
[38:43] keep your eyes on Jesus. When there's
[38:47] fear all around you, keep your eyes on
[38:53] Jesus. All the raging and rolling
[38:58] is trying to make you forget who you
[39:04] have with you. In your darkest, in your
[39:10] darkest
[39:11] hour,
[39:13] keep your eyes on Jesus. When there's
[39:17] fear all around you, keep your eyes on
[39:23] Jesus.
[39:24] All the raging and rolling is trying to
[39:30] make you forget who you have with you.
[39:40] Jesus
[39:43] is here.
[39:47] Waves you won't break me.
[39:51] storm. You won't shake me.
[39:55] Jesus
[39:58] is here.
[40:00] [Music]
[40:02] Oh ye tempest, you will all be still.
[40:11] Peace
[40:14] be still.
[40:18] Oh, peace
[40:22] be still. Peace be still.
[40:26] Oh, peace
[40:29] be there. Peace be still. Oh, peace.
[40:40] [Music]
[40:49] Let's just sing the song as um brother
[40:51] John comes this morning.
[40:55] What gift of grace
[40:58] is Jesus my redeemer.
[41:03] There is no more
[41:06] for heaven now to give.
[41:10] [Music]
[41:11] He is my joy,
[41:14] my righteousness and freedom,
[41:19] my steadfast love,
[41:22] my deep and boundless peace.
[41:27] To this I hope my hope is only Jesus.
[41:35] For my life
[41:37] is wholly bound to him. is.
[41:43] Oh, how strange and divine I can sing.
[41:49] All is mine, yet not I, but through
[41:54] Christ in me. The night is dark. The
[41:59] night is dark,
[42:01] but I am not forsaken.
[42:06] Oh, by my side,
[42:09] the Savior, he will stay.
[42:14] I labor on in weakness and rejoicing.
[42:21] [Music]
[42:29] To this I hope my shepherd will defend
[42:35] me.
[42:37] through the deepest
[42:40] valley
[42:41] will be
[42:44] all the night
[42:48] and I shall overcome
[42:52] not I but through Christ
[42:56] in me
[42:59] no dread I dread
[43:02] I know I am let's sing it today It's our
[43:05] last service together.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it like a choir.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Oh
[43:14] Lord,
[43:17] &gt;&gt; and suffered for my pardon.
[43:22] He was raised, hallelujah, to overthrow
[43:27] my grace.

[43:30] [Applause]
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. My sin has been.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:40] [Music]

[44:03] goodness. Lord, we want to praise you.

[44:10] marvelous victory. How the walls have
[44:12] come crashing down.
[44:15] Hallelujah. Lord, we thank you for every
[44:18] healing, for every deliverance, for
[44:20] every person that you FILLED WITH YOUR
[44:23] SPIRIT, for answering our questions,
[44:26] dissolving our doubts, giving us the
[44:28] victory. In Jesus' name, we wave today
[44:31] our flags of victory. Hallelujah. Sons
[44:35] and daughters of God, we are your
[44:38] victory, oh God. Once more today, once
[44:41] more today, visit this auditorium. Once

[44:47] more today, great shepherd of the flock.
[44:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Lord.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Can we all say once more?
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Once more. God bless you. God bless you.
[45:01] Don't you love him today?
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you shake hands for the
[45:06] last time like this as a body of
[45:09] believers? Turn around, shake hands, say
[45:12] goodbye, greet one another. I love you.
[45:15] God bless you.
[45:25] [Music]
[47:17] Praise his name.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; This has just been a little bit of like
[47:21] heaven to us. Amen. There's room up here
[47:23] in the front. If some of you in the back
[47:25] want to move a little closer, I'm being
[47:26] really serious.
[47:28] I'm serious. If there's some in the back
[47:30] that want to move, just grab your Bible.
[47:32] Come up a little closer. Come up a
[47:35] little closer. I mean, David is on the
[47:37] front row all by himself right here.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; He needs company.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. Thank you. Just move
[47:45] on a little closer.
[47:52] Yeah. Just move up a little bit. Grab
[47:54] your Bibles.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; I thought maybe a sister would come up
[48:06] and stand by brother David maybe. Or
[48:09] Hallelujah.
[48:13] You all know what happens after those
[48:15] things happen. Then you just start
[48:17] moving back and back. and your children
[48:19] and then
[48:21] [Music]
[48:23] Amen. God bless you. I'm just going to
[48:25] let you have your seats for a moment and
[48:27] we this is our final words and I'm going
[48:29] to make a deal with you about the length
[48:32] of the service. So,
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just after we have some opening
[48:41] comments and we read our scriptures, I'm
[48:43] going to make a deal with you. Is that
[48:44] okay?
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz some of you all stayed up all night.
[48:47] I heard last night and
[48:50] so you just were must have been fasting
[48:52] and praying and
[48:55] talking about the word and
[48:59] my we thank everyone for all your giving
[49:01] the
[49:03] just every part of it the coffees who
[49:05] appreciated the coffees and Amen
[49:13] you know as a minister pastor you get
[49:15] all kinds of spiritual questions
[49:18] Is there going to be coffee in heaven?
[49:22] Is there going to be chocolate in
[49:24] heaven? You know, this is serious, you
[49:27] know, and well, all that you loved or
[49:28] ever loved you. So, you answer the
[49:31] question. Amen.
[49:34] Amen. Isn't the Lord good? And the the
[49:36] food, the fellowship, the room, the um
[49:40] showers, the the towels, the water.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; The water was hot. Was it hot in your
[49:46] room?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; My That's incredible.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; I've been to camps where it's been cold.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; You take cold. I guess it wakes you up,
[49:54] you know, and cold plunges aren't bad
[49:56] for you.
[49:58] Some of the people left uh last evening
[50:01] and some left this morning for Auckland
[50:04] and other churches and some have to
[50:06] leave immediately after the service. So,
[50:08] we're very mindful of our time and our
[50:11] our time together. And um back at home
[50:15] um our church has already had their
[50:17] morning service and they're about ready
[50:20] to have their Sunday evening service cuz
[50:22] the time change. You know, you all live
[50:24] in the future,
[50:27] &gt;&gt; living in the future. You know that
[50:28] that's New Zealand.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; And so we're really thankful that um
[50:33] God's given you churches and the church
[50:35] bodies and and um well, how's the sheep
[50:39] doing this morning?
[50:43] [Applause]
[50:46] Amen. I had to just remind everybody,
[50:49] you can you can be as spiritual as you
[50:51] want to and
[50:52] &gt;&gt; but when it all comes down to it, we're
[50:55] just sheep. Amen. And
[50:57] &gt;&gt; somebody said, "Dumb sheep." Well, sheep
[50:59] need to be led. And
[51:01] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, "We can't even
[51:03] lead one another."
[51:05] &gt;&gt; So, um, we just are thankful for the
[51:08] Lord. I wanted to make a couple
[51:10] comments. Um, and that is if the Lord
[51:14] has spoken to anyone during these
[51:16] services and meetings and you've never
[51:18] been baptized,
[51:20] I would encourage you. I know that uh
[51:23] brother Jonathan's messages have been so
[51:25] profound and the times in the word, but
[51:29] sometimes we forget that there's hearts
[51:31] that are maybe just young and tender or
[51:34] new ones or children that um just need
[51:38] to take that step. And I want to
[51:41] encourage you, the Bible says to repent
[51:43] and to be baptized, every one of you,
[51:47] and that you would be filled with the
[51:48] Holy Ghost.
[51:50] So, if the Lord has talked to you and
[51:52] you've never been baptized or I would
[51:55] just encourage you to take those steps
[51:57] &gt;&gt; and let the Lord fill you with the Holy
[51:59] Spirit
[52:01] &gt;&gt; and then I feel it's real important to
[52:04] get into a good home church.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Um, support a home church with your
[52:10] presence.
[52:11] You know, my wife and I, we just visited
[52:13] back where I was born and raised in
[52:15] Jeffersonville and the Brandham
[52:17] Tabernacle, and it just sits, it sits
[52:21] empty today.
[52:23] There's no sermons. There's no Sunday
[52:25] school. There's no children. There's no
[52:28] amens.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; They've changed in their thoughts.
[52:31] They're just staying home and press and
[52:33] play.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; I'll be very honest with you. If brother
[52:37] Brandham was alive and back on the
[52:39] scene, he would be ashamed of that.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Going to church is what every Christian
[52:46] should do.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And that's not even staying home and
[52:49] streaming.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; I know through co and things and I still
[52:56] got money in the bank. Amen. So,
[53:00] &gt;&gt; and I'm leaving this afternoon, too.
[53:04] But
[53:05] going to a home church isn't just all
[53:08] about you. It's for others.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; I saw it even last night to some that
[53:12] are in these meetings that don't have a
[53:14] home church and they stream and they
[53:16] whatever. But I saw other people connect
[53:19] with that person. And I just want to
[53:21] remind you as a sister, as a brother
[53:24] that church is not all about you. It's
[53:26] about being part of a body and
[53:29] &gt;&gt; being part of people that can um be
[53:32] together.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Streaming is not the answer.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; And through COVID and things, I know
[53:39] people from New Zealand, you can stream
[53:41] from America or Trinidad or Europe or
[53:44] somewhere around the world, but that's
[53:46] not your pastor.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; You need to get under a pastor,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; a local pastor.
[53:53] It's not good enough on a Sunday to
[53:54] listen stream three or four or five of
[53:58] your favorite ministers from America or
[54:01] Europe or somewhere else. That's not the
[54:05] order of the of the Holy Spirit for your
[54:08] life.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; And I I'm I'm a pastor. You don't need
[54:13] to come to my church. You don't just
[54:15] always need to say, "I like this certain
[54:18] brother, this certain purse, and this
[54:19] certain music program, and then just sit
[54:22] there in your chair with, you know, your
[54:24] little bunny slippers, you know, and
[54:26] your coffee and
[54:29] &gt;&gt; you know, and go to the bathroom and
[54:31] come back and they're still preaching."
[54:33] That's not church.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; You need to go physically
[54:38] &gt;&gt; and support it with your presence and be
[54:40] present in worship.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; So repent. be baptized,
[54:46] receive the word for your day, and then
[54:48] get into a local church
[54:51] &gt;&gt; that you can serve. I understand that
[54:54] there's some here that are are moving to
[54:56] Perth, Australia on Tuesday. Can they
[54:59] stand to their feet? Can they stand to
[55:01] their feet? Some of our the family
[55:03] that's going to Perth, Australia, and
[55:09] God bless you. I think there's a family
[55:11] and children going there. God bless you.
[55:15] Um, thank you. Um, I I was 16 years old
[55:19] when my father moved us to another
[55:22] church and to be part of a ministry and
[55:25] and um it wasn't easy for them. They my
[55:29] father and mother made a decision to
[55:31] move their children to a church and
[55:33] sacrificed for that. And I um I'm
[55:37] thankful for that. Sometimes doing what
[55:40] God asks us to do is not easy.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; And um this is our last service and so
[55:46] the comments that's going to be made
[55:47] today is kind of uh moving beyond the
[55:50] now, looking beyond the now. And it's
[55:53] just looking down the road and after you
[55:55] leave camp, every single person that
[55:58] drove into this camp through that um
[56:01] fence there when I drove across it and
[56:03] the little place that they have so sheep
[56:07] and cattle and and horses can't cross, I
[56:10] just prayed that every single person
[56:13] that came in when they go out that they
[56:16] would have had a um something happen
[56:19] within their hearts.
[56:21] Can the church say amen? That
[56:23] &gt;&gt; we came in and we go out. But I pray for
[56:25] you that as you go out that the Holy
[56:28] Spirit would have lodged something deep
[56:30] within your heart.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Four years ago, we made decisions uh in
[56:35] our local area and we've made decisions.
[56:37] I wrote these notes when brother
[56:39] Jonathan um was um speaking last night
[56:42] because I knew that this was going to be
[56:44] my last Where is Brother Jonathan?
[56:46] There's brother Jonathan who appreciated
[56:48] the words that we have. Amen.
[56:51] Hallelujah. The message.
[56:58] And I'm not going to get into our
[57:00] testimony or my wife's life and what's
[57:03] happened to us in the last four years.
[57:06] Brother um Jonathan mentioned his wife
[57:08] and his family or his personal ministry.
[57:12] I was streaming in January when brother
[57:16] Jonathan made a decision to from being a
[57:19] pastor to join another church and be a
[57:22] part of that group and it's not easy.
[57:25] Every decision that we make is not
[57:27] always easy
[57:29] &gt;&gt; and many times others will
[57:31] misunderstand.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; They might even cancel culture you and
[57:35] cancel you
[57:37] &gt;&gt; out of their lives. But you just need to
[57:39] know that that's what the Lord's called
[57:41] you to do.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; We stand by grace. We live by grace.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; We preach it. We talk about it. But when
[57:48] we walk out of this uh camp and drive
[57:50] out of here, we're going to need grace.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Not just spoken from a preacher, but we
[57:56] need it every single day.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; So today, and if you're writing notes,
[58:03] would like to write down a title, like
[58:04] to know where we're coming from. I would
[58:07] like to speak on 2025,
[58:11] not 1965.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; We're not in 1965.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; That's 60 years ago.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; To the bride of New Zealand, we must
[58:22] turn the corner.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; This is Monday morning, October the
[58:26] 27th.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is that true?
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Did I have the date right?
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And whether we like it or not,
[58:36] &gt;&gt; whether we realize it or not, it's not a
[58:38] surprise that we're living in 2025.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Your cell phones tell you that, your
[58:44] computers tell you that, the calendar
[58:46] just keeps turning. It keeps turning.
[58:48] It's not a surprise to anybody in the
[58:51] natural that we're 2025. But why is it
[58:54] so difficult to see that we're in
[58:57] another season spiritually? We are in
[58:59] another season. And before we stand, I
[59:02] just wanted because I'm going to make
[59:03] you deal in a few minutes.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make you a deal. I'm going
[59:07] to hold to it.
[59:10] And um cuz I'm not going to keep you
[59:13] long.
[59:15] But when brother Brandham was talking in
[59:17] in 1964, this is after the seals, he
[59:20] said each generation,
[59:22] the church usually gets it so mixed up
[59:25] and everything till when the time comes
[59:27] for the word to be fulfilled. They're
[59:29] looking back to some other generation
[59:33] way back what happened way back some
[59:35] other day and they miss seeing what's
[59:38] happened in that day.
[59:40] Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; In another place, he said, "Science
[59:43] don't look back." They say what science
[59:46] says. I read where science proved by
[59:49] rolling a ball over in France about 300
[59:51] years ago, if a man ever went the
[59:53] terrific speed of 35 miles an hour, he'd
[59:56] leave the earth. And I come back down
[59:59] here and he was talking about traveling
[1:00:03] to the meeting at about 60 miles an
[1:00:05] hour. That's 100 kilometers an hour.
[1:00:09] So science don't refer back to that.
[1:00:12] Science doesn't refer back to, well, if
[1:00:14] we go 35, we're going to leave the earth
[1:00:17] because we're already traveling faster
[1:00:18] today.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You say, well, I'm I'm going to whatever
[1:00:21] science says. Whatever science says. No,
[1:00:24] science don't even refer back to that.
[1:00:26] They keep pressing on. They got him now
[1:00:28] looking hundreds of miles an hour. They
[1:00:30] don't stop at that. They just keep on
[1:00:32] pressing. But we we're looking back.
[1:00:35] What did Finny say? What did Sanki say?
[1:00:38] What did Moody say? They were fine men.
[1:00:41] So was Moses. So was Joseph. That was
[1:00:44] another age.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Let's see what the word says today. What
[1:00:48] Jesus Christ is.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Let's all say is.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want to offend anyone right
[1:00:54] away. Finny was a good man. Sanki was a
[1:00:58] fine man. Moody was a fine man. Moses
[1:01:01] was a good person. Joseph was a good
[1:01:03] person. WILLIAM BRHAM WAS A GOOD PERSON.
[1:01:06] YES.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; I want to live back there. No, you're
[1:01:11] 2025.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Wake up today.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; I didn't lose anybody already. Did I say
[1:01:21] your title? You lost me. Well, just get
[1:01:24] just keep looking down the road. Amen.
[1:01:26] Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; So our last quote before we stand these
[1:01:30] little creeds and and greater than
[1:01:32] Solomon, he said if you know our creed
[1:01:35] and he said you're looking back to what
[1:01:38] Luther said, a great man of his day, no
[1:01:41] more than some of these women here 75
[1:01:44] years old trying to be 16. Looking back
[1:01:47] trying to dress like they're 16, cut off
[1:01:50] their hair, wear shorts. He said,
[1:01:52] "Anybody that drives looking through a
[1:01:55] rear view mirror has a wreck."
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And that's what's the matter with the
[1:02:00] church today. It's looking through a
[1:02:02] rear view mirror to what it was.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; No wonder it's wrecked up. Paul said,
[1:02:08] "Pressing to the mark of the high
[1:02:10] calling, I go forth. I go forward."
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; LET THE LORD PUT THAT FAITH IN YOUR
[1:02:16] HEART TODAY. Every single man and woman
[1:02:19] that came to this camp, I go forth.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; I GO FORWARD.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; I know Moo. Mr. Moody was a great man.
[1:02:29] Mr. Wesley was a great man. The
[1:02:31] Pentecostal move. The Baptist move were
[1:02:34] great. But let's press toward the mark
[1:02:37] of the high calling in Christ. Don't
[1:02:39] look through a rear view mirror 40 years
[1:02:42] ago.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Look what is tonight. Can I say this
[1:02:46] morning? Look what the scripture
[1:02:48] promises tonight. He did promise THEM IN
[1:02:51] THAT DAY. BUT WE'RE LIVING ON above
[1:02:53] there. Now we're going on.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; We're not leaving THE MESSAGE, BUT THE
[1:02:58] MESSAGE IS MOVING on in the people.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this again. I hope I'm
[1:03:03] not offending anyone. Mr. Moody was a
[1:03:06] great man. Mr. Wesley was a great man.
[1:03:08] The Pentecostal move was great. Baptist
[1:03:10] move was great. SO WAS WILLIAM BRHAM. A
[1:03:13] GREAT MOVE OF GOD. BUT WE'RE NOT IN
[1:03:15] 1965.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Wake up. Look to YOUR NEIGHBOR AND SAY,
[1:03:20] "THIS IS 2025."
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I'm doing that cuz some of you stayed up
[1:03:30] till 1 and 2 in the morning. And
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; so, let's all make a deal.
[1:03:40] It's 10:55
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; almost 11:00. Well, let's make a deal
[1:03:45] that Brother John will turn the service
[1:03:47] over to brother Brother Isaac or Brother
[1:03:49] Ben before 12:00.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; One hour.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Who thinks we It's the message of the
[1:03:58] hour.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; So, can we make a deal? Yes,
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; brother Jonno will keep my part,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; but you got to keep your part.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; You You I know you're weary, but you
[1:04:13] just got to say, "Lord, help me focus,
[1:04:15] Lord, in your word. It's not by might,
[1:04:17] not by power, but I need what's going to
[1:04:20] be spoken for down the road next week or
[1:04:22] the Can we agree with that?" So, Brother
[1:04:25] John will do my part. I'll watch my time
[1:04:27] and we can stay focused. I could preach
[1:04:29] for three hours,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; but let's just keep it focused. Keep it
[1:04:33] within the hour. We can pray, sing, say
[1:04:36] goodbye, love one another, cry on one
[1:04:39] another's shoulders, take all the photos
[1:04:41] you want.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Do we all agree?
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; So, no dazing off and everybody's
[1:04:47] lumping down and
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's get in the spirit together
[1:04:51] and let's hear what the spirit would say
[1:04:53] to the church. Okay, let's go. Leviticus
[1:04:56] chapter 23. We stand together. Turn to
[1:04:59] the scripture.
[1:05:01] No,
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; it's by the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; So, I had kind of have two parts of the
[1:05:07] the message this morning. I've brought
[1:05:10] this with me today. Does anybody know
[1:05:12] what this is here?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; This is a baton. This is a baton. So,
[1:05:17] about halfway through, we're going to
[1:05:19] kind of make a turn and speak about
[1:05:22] trusting the new generation, passing on
[1:05:24] the new generation, and passing the
[1:05:26] baton
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; to the new generation. So first is
[1:05:30] Leviticus 23:9.
[1:05:34] Lord, just take the word now as we take
[1:05:36] it into our hearts. May our hearts burn
[1:05:39] within us while you talk to us along the
[1:05:41] road. Help us as your children to be
[1:05:44] disciplined. Help us to be focused. May
[1:05:47] it not be word only, intellectual only,
[1:05:50] but let it be the Holy Spirit taking the
[1:05:53] things that we need for tomorrow, for
[1:05:55] Wednesday, for the coming days. If you
[1:05:58] would, Terry, I'm just being reminded
[1:06:00] right now of our believers in Jamaica
[1:06:02] that uh there's a forecasted uh storm
[1:06:06] hurricane coming striking their country
[1:06:09] and there's believers there. Our brother
[1:06:11] Jonathan just came from there. He's
[1:06:13] going to Pakistan in a few days. But
[1:06:15] some of our believers in Jamaica need
[1:06:18] our prayers today from the flooding,
[1:06:21] from all the rain, from all the waves. I
[1:06:23] pray in the name of Jesus that you would
[1:06:26] calm that storm and do a miracle. The
[1:06:28] news is saying how catastrophic it's
[1:06:31] going to be to destroy even most of the
[1:06:33] country. I pray in the name of Jesus
[1:06:36] that the believers would be safe that
[1:06:38] you would keep them. Lord, you did it
[1:06:40] for my wife and I. You turned a category
[1:06:43] 4 hurricane coming straight for us and
[1:06:46] you moved it and went off the path.
[1:06:48] Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus, you
[1:06:50] would be with your saints. Lord, in
[1:06:52] Jamaica and New Zealand and around this
[1:06:55] world, LORD, FILL US WITH THE HOLY
[1:06:57] GHOST. LORD, EVEN WHILE WE HEAR THE
[1:06:59] WORD, SEND US OFF ON OUR ROADS AND THOSE
[1:07:02] THAT ARE ALREADY TRAVELING WITH SAFETY
[1:07:04] AND MERCY. I pray, Lord, we are in 2025.
[1:07:09] Give us the strength we have need of for
[1:07:11] the journey in Jesus' name. And the
[1:07:13] church said,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:07:16] Leviticus 23 and verse 9, we see the
[1:07:21] Lord speaking unto Moses. Verse 10,
[1:07:24] speak unto the children of Israel and
[1:07:25] saying unto them, when you become into
[1:07:28] the land which I give unto you and shall
[1:07:31] reap, do you notice how positive the
[1:07:33] word is.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, we need your strength today.
[1:07:37] When ye become, not if, not maybe,
[1:07:40] you're going to drop off along the road,
[1:07:42] you shall reap the harvest thereof,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; then you shall bring a sheath
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; of the first fruits
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; OF YOUR HARVEST UNTO THE PRIEST,
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; and he shall wave the sheath before the
[1:08:01] Lord
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; to be accepted for you
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; on the Tomorrow after the Sabbath, THE
[1:08:09] PRIEST SHALL WAVE IT.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; The Sabbath IS THE SEVENTH DAY. THE
[1:08:14] TOMORROW IS THE DAY AFTER THE EIGHTH
[1:08:16] DAY.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; You were, IT WAS TO BE WAVED. THE PRIEST
[1:08:20] WAS TO WAVE it over the congregation
[1:08:23] over
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; verse 12. And ye shall offer that day
[1:08:27] which ye wave the sheath and helium
[1:08:30] without blemish of the first year. THIS
[1:08:34] IS A TYPE OF CHRIST, THE TOKEN, THE lamb
[1:08:38] being waved for you and I. Verse 14, the
[1:08:42] last part of this, THE LAST PART OF
[1:08:45] verse 14 says this would be a statute
[1:08:47] forever. Let's all say forever.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Forever
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; throughout your generations in the
[1:08:52] message, in all your dwellings.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 15. And you, and that's 2025.
[1:08:58] AMEN. IN ALL OF YOUR DWELLINGS, IN ALL
[1:09:00] OF YOUR SERVICES, WAVE THE TOKEN over
[1:09:03] the people.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 15, you shall count unto you.
[1:09:08] Here's another revelation. From the
[1:09:10] tomorrow after the Sabbath,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; from the day that ye brought the sheath
[1:09:14] of the wave offering, seven Sabbaths,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; seven * 7 is 49 shall be complete. Verse
[1:09:24] 16, but even unto the tomorrow after the
[1:09:28] seventh Sabbath shall you number 50
[1:09:31] days.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; 7 * 7 is 49 Sabbaths. The next day would
[1:09:37] be 50. 50 is Jubilee.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can have your seats.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; So let's focus. It is the rising of the
[1:09:51] sun.
[1:09:54] It is the rising
[1:09:56] of the sun.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; And it's not just a message.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; BUT I ASK YOU TODAY, WHAT HAS THIS
[1:10:03] RISING
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; PRODUCED
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; IN THE LIVES OF THE BELIEVERS IN NEW
[1:10:08] ZEALAND?
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; What has it produced? I was just a few
[1:10:18] days ago with brother Donnie Reagan here
[1:10:20] in Kentucky. This was the church that
[1:10:23] was being dedicated to the Lord. I
[1:10:25] didn't have internet in my room or I
[1:10:27] would have um show put in my notes
[1:10:30] because I gave my notes last night. So
[1:10:32] everything I say today and things was on
[1:10:35] my heart and what the Lord as far as
[1:10:37] putting on the screen or quotes was
[1:10:39] already by last night before brother
[1:10:40] Jonathan spoke. And a lot of what he
[1:10:43] said I just my my my I was like my I'm
[1:10:45] just going to be repeating but it's good
[1:10:47] for us. I would have put a picture of
[1:10:50] our of the Shakina camp right there to
[1:10:53] show you this is 2025
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; 1965
[1:10:58] our prophet spoke a message it is the
[1:11:01] rising of the sun.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful message.
[1:11:13] It is the rising of the sun. Not just su
[1:11:16] n but the s o n. But it's also the
[1:11:19] setting of the sun. IT SHALL BE LIGHT IN
[1:11:23] the evening time.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; SO IN THE TIME OF THE GOING DOWN OF THE
[1:11:27] SEN, THERE'S A RISING OF THE MOON,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS THE BRIDE.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S A RISING OF THE SUN, THERE'S
[1:11:34] A RISING OF THE BRIDE. THERE'S A GOING
[1:11:36] DOWN OF THE SUN, THERE'S A RISING OF THE
[1:11:39] MOON. AS he rose, she will rise. THE
[1:11:43] SAME SPIRIT THAT ROSE HIM FROM THE DEAD
[1:11:45] IS WHAT ROSE THE BRIDE OUT OF THE EARTH.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; SHE HAS RISEN.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; AND THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED CHRIST
[1:11:54] THROUGH THIS MESSAGE DWELLS IN YOU AND
[1:11:57] I. IT HAS QUICKENED US FROM OUR DEADNESS
[1:12:00] OF THE WORLD AND A AND DENOMINATION. YOU
[1:12:03] SAY THAT TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE
[1:12:05] MESSAGE. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
[1:12:06] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT A
[1:12:08] DENOMINATION. SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, STAY
[1:12:10] WITH THE TAPES. STAY WITH THE TAPES.
[1:12:12] YOUR CHILDREN DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A
[1:12:14] TAPE IS.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A CASSETTE IS.
[1:12:17] IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. IT'S ABOUT STAY
[1:12:20] WITH THE WORD.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; THAT MESSAGE HAS QUICKENED OUR SOULS.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS SPOKEN IN 1965
[1:12:30] and and those that word HAS QUICKENED
[1:12:33] OUR SPIRITS. IT'S QUICKENED OUR BODIES
[1:12:35] BACK TO CHRIST.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:39] But we're not living in 1965.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH JUST FOR US TO BE
[1:12:48] QUOTERS OF THE message
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; spiritually. We must live in a SEASON
[1:12:54] THAT GOD HAS PLANTED US.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I'm being very focused. If I'm looking
[1:12:58] down, that's because I want to BE VERY
[1:13:00] SPECIFIC. WE'RE NOT IN A PAST SEASON.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LIVING IN ANOTHER DAY. WE'RE
[1:13:06] LIVING TODAY. AND WE NEED TO STOP JUST
[1:13:09] ALWAYS LOOKING BACK, LOOKING BACK IN a
[1:13:11] rear view AND WANTING THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE GOOD OLD DAYS
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE,
[1:13:18] FOR THE NEW GENERATION.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; THE GOD OF THE YESTERDAY MUST BE THE GOD
[1:13:24] OF TODAY. NOT A QUOTE, NOT JUST A
[1:13:27] SCRIPTURE, NOT A POWERPOINT, NOT A A
[1:13:30] SONG THAT GETS US WHERE WE'RE JUST YES.
[1:13:32] YES. YES. AND THEN TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
[1:13:34] WE'RE JUST RIGHT DOWN. THE SAME GOD
[1:13:37] THAT'S BEEN AT THIS CAMP IS GOING TO BE
[1:13:39] WITH YOU.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; HE LIVES IN YOU.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; God has called YOU FOR THE NOW.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLED YOU TO LIVE IN A PRESENT
[1:13:49] GENERATION.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; And to live in THE GLARE OF A PAST AGE
[1:13:52] IS NOT FOR THE BRIDE. TO ALWAYS BE
[1:13:56] TALKING ABOUT THE PAST,
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; BUT TO BE ALWAYS LOOKING FORWARD AND
[1:14:01] TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; AND MISSING WHAT GOD IS DOING TODAY IS A
[1:14:07] MAJOR FAILURE
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; OF EVERY AGE. THEY'VE ALWAYS QUOTED AND
[1:14:11] QUOTED JESUS WHEN HE WAS HERE. THEY WERE
[1:14:13] QUOTING MOSES, ABRAHAM, and all that.
[1:14:15] AND AND THEY MISSED THE GOD OF THEM.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And then PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
[1:14:20] HEAVEN AND THE MILLENNIUM AND OUR FUTURE
[1:14:22] HOME. AND WE CAN ALL GET GUILTY OF THIS.
[1:14:25] OH, I WANT TO BE THERE AND OH HEAVEN,
[1:14:26] WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE, YOU KNOW,
[1:14:28] ONE ETERNAL YOUTH CAMP. WE CAN KIND OF
[1:14:30] LIVE LIKE THAT. AND THEN HERE WE GOT TO
[1:14:32] GO BACK TO school and back to
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; So we need to ask the Lord. AND I WAS
[1:14:43] THINKING OF THIS THIS MORNING. WE CAN
[1:14:45] HEAR GREAT MESSAGES. WE CAN BE UNDER
[1:14:47] INSPIRED PREACHERS. WE CAN JUST FEEL
[1:14:50] LIKE THERE THERE'S ANGELS ALL AROUND US
[1:14:52] AND WE GET CAUGHT UP INTO A CERTAIN
[1:14:54] PLACE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO OUR
[1:14:57] SCHOOL AND BACK TO OUR JOBS AND BACK TO
[1:14:59] OUR HOMES. THE THE HOME CHURCH WILL
[1:15:02] PROBABLY HAVE SERVICES WEDNESDAY or
[1:15:04] Thursday or next Sunday.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE LIVING OFF THE
[1:15:10] PAST.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; I WANT A GOD OF TODAY.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE CAN MISS WHAT GOD'S DOING
[1:15:16] TODAY, LOOKING BACK, LOOKING FORWARD.
[1:15:19] WE'VE GOT TO WALK IN THE LIGHT
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; AS IT'S BEING REVEALED TODAY.
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; How many remember the message birth
[1:15:31] pains?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And how many know what year it was
[1:15:35] preached in?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; 1965.
[1:15:40] Brother Brandham was speaking, opening
[1:15:42] up his scripture. His wife had given him
[1:15:45] a Bible. The pages stuck together. He's
[1:15:47] trying to read a scripture he didn't
[1:15:49] know at the time. A CATHOLIC PRIEST that
[1:15:52] was on the the platform passed him his
[1:15:55] Bible AND ACTUALLY PROPHESIED to him.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham called him Brother
[1:16:00] Stanley.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Stanley.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; He he passed him his Bible and brother
[1:16:07] Brandham READ THE SCRIPTURE. BIRTH PAINS
[1:16:09] and then handed it back TO THE PRIEST.
[1:16:13] HE PREACHED A WHOLE MESSAGE OF BIRTH
[1:16:15] PAINANS
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT HE WAS
[1:16:18] ACTUALLY LIVING in a prophecy
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; TILL IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN HIS CHILDREN
[1:16:24] NEEDED A sandwich
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; and him AND HIS WIFE WERE TALKING IN THE
[1:16:29] CAR AND WASN'T YOU SO embarrassed she
[1:16:31] said and he SAID NO NO I JUST IT'S A NEW
[1:16:33] BIBLE AND THE PAGES WERE STUCK TOGETHER
[1:16:36] AND THEY GOT IT AND THEY REALIZED THE
[1:16:38] PAGES WERE JUST STUCK TOGETHER. HE WAS
[1:16:40] READING FROM ANOTHER PLACE.
[1:16:43] YEAH.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY SPIRIT SPOKE TO HIM AND
[1:16:46] SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE SCRIPTURE
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PRIEST HANDED THE BIBLE, HANDED
[1:16:51] THE SCROLL TO JESUS."
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; AND HE FOUND THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS
[1:16:55] WRITTEN IN ISAIAH.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; I've come to heal the brokenhearted.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; SET THE CAPTIVES FREE. LOOSE THOSE THAT
[1:17:05] ARE BOUND. THE EYES COME OPEN.
[1:17:08] HE FOUND HIS PLACE
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; AND HE GAVE IT BACK TO THE PRIEST. IT
[1:17:12] WAS ONLY THEN,
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; SEE, HE WENT BACK TO HIS NORMAL COURSE
[1:17:16] OF LIFE WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME ON AND HE
[1:17:18] REALIZED THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE is
[1:17:22] fulfilled.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; The very next night after birth pains,
[1:17:27] he spoke that to the to the church. I
[1:17:29] think it was 20 or 30 minutes. that when
[1:17:32] he went back to Jeffersonville and speak
[1:17:34] that spoke that weekend, don't don't
[1:17:37] worry about this young man. Don't let
[1:17:38] him be distracted. We we we're under a
[1:17:41] time limit. Amen. He's just being fine.
[1:17:43] Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; God bless the lambs.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; My thought about this is if William
[1:17:52] Brham, OUR PROPHET, COULD PREACH A WHOLE
[1:17:54] MESSAGE AND NOT REALIZE HE'S FULFILLING
[1:17:57] THAT UNTIL LATER, WHAT ABOUT THE BRIDE
[1:18:00] OF CHRIST? IS IT POSSIBLE that you and I
[1:18:03] COULD ACTUALLY BE FULFILLING THE
[1:18:05] SCRIPTURE FOR TODAY, PROPHECY FOR TODAY,
[1:18:07] AND NOT EVEN REALIZE IT TILL THE HOLY
[1:18:10] GHOST OPENS OUR EYES AND WE BEGIN TO SEE
[1:18:13] THIS DAY.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD SPOKE ABOUT IN THE BIBLE IS
[1:18:17] HAPPENING RIGHT IN MY LIFE. AMEN.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; HE WENT BACK TO JEFFERSONVILLE AND SPOKE
[1:18:25] THIS DAY THIS SCRIPTURE is fulfilled and
[1:18:27] laid it all OUT THERE SO THAT we would
[1:18:29] understand. BUT THAT WAS 1965.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; So from 1965 TO 2025 IS 60 YEARS.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I'm asking
[1:18:43] believers here in New Zealand, what did
[1:18:46] that produce in your country?
[1:18:49] What has it birthed?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE WAS TALKING ABOUT BIRTH PAINS.
[1:18:56] AND A WOMAN when is in travail. A woman
[1:18:58] is a type of the church.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; What did she produce?
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; We're 60 YEARS LATER.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT A LITTLE B BRIDE BOUNCING DOWN
[1:19:09] THE aisle like just youth and
[1:19:11] everything's JUST NEW. WE'RE 60 YEARS
[1:19:14] NOW.
[1:19:16] EVEN THE BRIDE IN NEW ZEALAND is older.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Some of you older ONES HAVE HAD A CHANGE
[1:19:22] OF LIFE.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT AS WET AS IT USED TO BE. THE
[1:19:26] SEED DOESN'T COME DOWN THERE. THE FUN
[1:19:29] AND EXCITEMENT OF BEING NEWLY MARRIED
[1:19:31] AND ALL OF THAT. A LOT OF I'VE HEAR A
[1:19:33] LOT ABOUT CHURCH PROBLEMS AND CHURCH
[1:19:35] ISSUES AND THINGS, BUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
[1:19:37] ARE IN THAT FERTILE TIME WHERE THE WORD
[1:19:40] IS STRIKING THEIR HEARTS AND THEY NEED
[1:19:42] TO HAVE IT FRESH.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:44] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; BUT THE CHURCH OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE
[1:19:47] BRIDE IS NOT JUST A YOUNG YOUTHFUL
[1:19:49] HEARING AT IT FOR THIS TIME AND YOU KNOW
[1:19:51] FIVE BAPTISMS EVERY SUNDAY AND WE'VE HAD
[1:19:53] 10 BAPTISMS IN THE LAST MONTH. IT'S NOT
[1:19:56] LIKE THAT ANYMORE. WE ARE IN ANOTHER
[1:19:58] SEASON.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAS THE MESSAGE PRODUCED
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; IN our lives?
[1:20:07] BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN 1965
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; and it's not GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR
[1:20:13] THE NEW GENERATION JUST TO HEAR ABOUT
[1:20:15] THE WAY THAT IT USED TO be
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; because the whole mission of THE MESSAGE
[1:20:24] IS TO PRODUCE CHRIST BACK INTO THE
[1:20:27] PEOPLE.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE MISSION OF THE GOSPEL IS TO
[1:20:31] PRODUCE JESUS CHRIST BACK AGAIN IN THE
[1:20:35] PEOPLE.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH. AMEN.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; THE OLD PEOPLE, THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; AND IN THE CHURCH AGE BOOK WHEN BROTHER
[1:20:41] BRANDON WAS TALKING ABOUT THE AGES AND
[1:20:43] THE TIMES AND AND THE BLACKOUT OF THE
[1:20:45] WORD AND things and how it would come to
[1:20:48] where there would be even coming into A
[1:20:50] GREAT TRIBULATION. BUT IF YOU ARE TRUE
[1:20:53] SEED and are truly baptized WITH THE
[1:20:55] HOLY GHOST, YOU will esteem HIS WORD
[1:20:58] ABOVE YOUR NECESSARY MEAT.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS GROANING, THIS CRY, THIS
[1:21:04] THIRST HAS GOT TO BE MORE THAN OUR
[1:21:06] MORNING COFFEE.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE GREATER THAN WHAT CHURCH
[1:21:10] YOU BELONG TO AND WHO MY FRIEND LIST IS
[1:21:14] AND WHETHER THEY'RE THUMBS UP OR WHETHER
[1:21:16] THEY'RE THUMBS DOWN. I'M SERVING JESUS.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PART OF A CLUB. I I DON'T I'M
[1:21:22] NOT DIRECTED BY A GROUP OF MINISTERS
[1:21:24] CHAT THAT, YOU KNOW, PUTS THUMBS UP AND
[1:21:26] OH YES, BROTHER AND FRIENDS. IF ALL
[1:21:29] HELL, ALL THE WORLD IS AGAINST YOU.
[1:21:32] YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT GOD'S CALLED YOU
[1:21:33] TO DO.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; There's no man, THERE'S NO WOMAN,
[1:21:36] THERE'S NO FRIEND, THERE'S NO ONE THAT
[1:21:39] CAN MOVE YOU OFF TRACK.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; BUT WHY HAVE SO MANY GOT OFF TRACK?
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; WHY HAVE WE MADE CLUBS AROUND THE
[1:21:47] MESSAGE?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, WE ARE LIVING IN 2025, NOT
[1:21:52] 1965.
[1:21:54] Joel chapter 1 and VERSE TWO TALKS ABOUT
[1:21:57] I WILL RESTORE SAYETH THE LORD
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS GOD. I WILL RESTORE.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE IS NOT MAYBE.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE SAYAETH THE LORD MEANS
[1:22:13] I'M GOING TO MAKE AMENDS. I'm going to
[1:22:15] end ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN GOING
[1:22:18] THROUGH AND ALL THE STRUGGLES AND YOU
[1:22:20] SAY WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE
[1:22:21] MILLENNIUM. NO, HE'S TALKING ABOUT
[1:22:23] INTERNALLY. HE'S GOING TO FINISH THE
[1:22:25] WAR. HE'S GOING TO STOP THE FIGHTING.
[1:22:28] HE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU BACK AGAIN ALL
[1:22:31] THE YEARS.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT GOOD. HE'S GOING
[1:22:34] TO PERFECT YOU. HE'S GOING TO PERFORM
[1:22:37] IT.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; AND BRING YOU TO PEACE.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL PROSPER.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; GOD IS GOING TO REWARD YOU FOR GIVING
[1:22:45] YOUR LIFE TO HIM. YOU ARE NOT A BEGGAR.
[1:22:48] YOU ARE NOT A SECOND RATE CITIZEN. YOU
[1:22:51] ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THESE BIBLE DAYS.
[1:22:56] WE'RE LIVING IN 2025.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; BUT THESE ARE BIBLE DAYS AGAIN.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT IN 1965.
[1:23:04] BUT IF BROTHER BRANDHAM STOOD HERE, AS
[1:23:07] BROTHER JONATHAN STOOD HERE, and we
[1:23:08] STOOD HERE, BROTHER BEN STOOD HERE AND
[1:23:10] THESE OTHER PASTORS THAT WERE HERE THIS
[1:23:12] WEEKEND, I BELIEVE THE BRIDE OF NEW
[1:23:14] ZEALAND IS A TROPHY OF GOD'S AMAZING
[1:23:17] GRACE.
[1:23:18] DON'T TALK TO ME ALWAYS JUST ABOUT YOUR
[1:23:20] TROUBLES AND YOUR WARINGS AND YOUR
[1:23:22] FIGHTINGS BECAUSE THE WORD HAS ALREADY
[1:23:24] LIFTED US UP INTO HEAVENLY PLACES.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T SEE YOUR SPOTS. HE DOESN'T
[1:23:28] SEE YOUR WRINKLES. HE FRIENDS, WE NOT
[1:23:31] JUST IN THE FRONT YARD OR THE BACKYARD.
[1:23:34] OUR LIVES IS CHRIST.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, IN THE FRONT YARD WE ALL
[1:23:38] ARE NICE AND GOOD, BUT WE FIGHT IN THE
[1:23:40] BACKYARD." BUT THE BRIDE IS LEARNING we
[1:23:42] cannot FIGHT IN THE BACKYARD.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; STOP YOUR FIGHTING.
[1:23:49] AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I will restore means I'm going to bring
[1:23:53] your mind back to where it ought to be.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to BRING YOUR SPIRIT BACK TO
[1:23:57] where it ought to be.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; YOUR WANDERING SPIRIT, YOUR TROUBLED
[1:24:01] MIND. I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO
[1:24:02] WHERE YOU CAN BE WHOLE
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; AND COMPLETE.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; I SPEAK IT OVER YOU AT OUR LAST SERVICE.
[1:24:08] GOD HAS GIVEN YOU A COVENANT OF PEACE.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; AND AND WE HAVE OUR COMPLETENESS TODAY
[1:24:14] IN JESUS CHRIST. MY SOUND MIND HAS BEEN
[1:24:17] GIVEN ME BY JESUS CHRIST.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; He is your medicine.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; HE IS YOUR GOSPEL.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT AGAINST MEDICATION. I'M NOT
[1:24:31] AGAINST MENTAL ILLNESS uh situations
[1:24:34] where PEOPLE NEED MEDICINE. BUT OUR GOD
[1:24:36] IS THE ONLY HEALER THERE IS.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT AGAINST CRUTCHES OR WHEELCHAIRS
[1:24:41] OR I'M NOT AGAINST THINGS OF THIS LIFE
[1:24:43] THAT WE NEED. AND AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED
[1:24:45] pills or HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR LOW
[1:24:47] PRESSURE, WHATEVER IT IS. I WAS
[1:24:49] LISTENING TO A MESSAGE THE OTHER DAY AND
[1:24:51] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THIS. HE SAID,
[1:24:53] "TAKE THE SUGAR OUT OF THEIR BLOOD."
[1:24:56] TALKING ABOUT DIABETES.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THERE'S POWER IN THE WORD
[1:24:59] TODAY.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; But if YOU HAVE BLOOD SUGAR PROBLEMS AND
[1:25:03] DIABETES AND STRUGGLE WITH THAT TILL YOU
[1:25:05] DIE, GOD'S STILL MY HEALER.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; AND THE MOMENT I PASS FROM THIS LIFE
[1:25:09] INTO ANOTHER, I CHANGED. I KNOW HAVE NO
[1:25:13] DIABETES IN THAT OTHER PLACE.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I MIGHT STRUGGLE HERE, BUT THERE'S NO
[1:25:18] STRUGGLE THERE.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Speaking to some of you privately and
[1:25:27] hearing your testimony. Some of you are
[1:25:29] so vulnerable and honest. Even
[1:25:31] yesterday, some speaking about suicide
[1:25:34] and things that have happened in your
[1:25:36] families, in your homes. Yesterday after
[1:25:40] we closed the service, I was sitting
[1:25:42] over there and I think brother um Isaac
[1:25:46] mentioned something about seeing someone
[1:25:48] committing suicide. I'll never forget
[1:25:50] being born and raised in the tabernacle.
[1:25:52] Can I give something personal real I'm
[1:25:54] going to be quick. I'm speaking quickly.
[1:25:57] My best friend being raised in the
[1:25:58] Brandham Tabernacle was the pastor's
[1:26:00] grandson.
[1:26:02] His father was a deacon. If I would say
[1:26:05] his name, you would know it from the
[1:26:08] messages. And I was raised up. HE WAS MY
[1:26:10] BEST FRIEND IN THE BRANDOM TABERNACLE.
[1:26:12] We grew up together. I was in his home,
[1:26:14] slept in the bed. We were friends. But
[1:26:16] as WE GOT INTO OUR TEENAGE YEARS, HE
[1:26:18] KIND OF WENT ANOTHER WAY AND BECAME PART
[1:26:21] of his student council at at the high
[1:26:24] school, lost his he would COME TO
[1:26:26] CHURCH. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT JUST HE BEGIN
[1:26:28] TO GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. THEY found
[1:26:31] him one day. He had committed suicide
[1:26:33] and taken his own life. I'LL NEVER
[1:26:35] FORGET BEING IN THE GRAVESIDE. IT'S THE
[1:26:37] GRAVE, SAME GRAVESIDE WHERE BROTHER
[1:26:40] WILLIAM BRANDHAM IS BURIED, where
[1:26:41] brother Billy Paul is buried, where my
[1:26:43] grandpa's buried there. Many other
[1:26:45] believers is buried there in
[1:26:46] Jeffersonville. He's buried THERE. I'LL
[1:26:48] NEVER FORGET THE DAY. I MEAN, THEIR
[1:26:50] SCHOOL BUSES ARE PACKED FULL of young
[1:26:53] people from all around and him from his
[1:26:55] school. He was popular and he had
[1:26:57] committed suicide. I'LL NEVER FORGET
[1:26:59] BEING THERE. IT'S IN MY MIND FOREVER
[1:27:02] seeing his mother just throw herself
[1:27:04] OVER HIS CASKET AND SAY, "BUT YOU NEVER
[1:27:07] SAID GOODBYE."
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; A MOTHER JUST WAILING. YOU NEVER SAID
[1:27:15] GOODBYE.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. AND I THOUGHT OF
[1:27:19] SATAN, HOW HE COMES TO BREAK UP HOMES
[1:27:22] AND COME THROUGH A MOTHER, THROUGH A
[1:27:24] FATHER, THROUGH A SITUATION IN AT
[1:27:26] SCHOOL, SOMEBODY BULLYING YOU, ABUSE
[1:27:29] THAT HAPPEN, SEXUAL ABUSE, MENTAL ABUSE,
[1:27:37] and how it wears on us.
[1:27:42] AND OFTEN TIMES WE FEEL BROKEN
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; AND CONTRITE.
[1:27:49] SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE THE LITTLEST
[1:27:51] person in the message.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; WE FEEL LIKE A DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE A
[1:27:56] CHRISTIAN. I I'VE PRAYED WITH MOTHERS
[1:27:58] THAT ARE EVEN WONDERING WHETHER THEY
[1:28:00] HAVE THE HOLY GHOST OR NOT.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S INCREDIBLE. WE WE FACE INCREDIBLE
[1:28:06] MIND BATTLES.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; AND THEN TO HAVE THE WORD COME TO US
[1:28:10] LIKE WE EVEN THIS WEEKEND IS SO POSITIVE
[1:28:12] AND SO GOOD AND WE CAN STAND. WE CAN
[1:28:15] LIFT OUR HANDS. WE CAN WE CAN EVEN
[1:28:17] DANCE.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; BUT THE REALITY OF OUR EXPERIENCE COMES
[1:28:22] RIGHT BACK WHEN THEN WE'RE FACED WITH
[1:28:24] OUR THE THE THE NORMAL COURSE OF LIFE.
[1:28:27] THIS THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING. OFTEN
[1:28:30] TIMES THERE'S A GREAT DISCONNECT between
[1:28:33] the message, the sermons we hear,
[1:28:36] CHARISMATIC PREACHERS THAT ARE ANOINTED,
[1:28:39] AND THEN JUST OUR DAILY LIVES. LET'S BE
[1:28:42] REAL.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT.
[1:28:45] THE MUSIC, the church, Brother Brandham,
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; these ministers, AND AND WE CAN ALMOST
[1:28:52] BECOME WHERE WE MAKE GOOD MINISTERS
[1:28:55] ALLSTAR PREACHERS, AND WE MAKE THEM OUR
[1:28:58] BEST AND ON OUR LIST, AND WE GOT TO JUST
[1:29:00] BE FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN WE'RE IN, OH,
[1:29:02] HEARING THAT SERVICE. IF WE'RE NOT
[1:29:04] CAREFUL, WE'LL RAISE A WHOLE GENERATION
[1:29:07] LIKE THE DRUG ERA THAT JUST LOOK FOR
[1:29:09] FRIDAY NIGHT, THE NEXT PUNT, THE NEXT
[1:29:11] MOVEMENT, THE NEXT PRAYER LINE, THE NEXT
[1:29:13] SPECIAL SERVICE, THE NEXT MEETING. I'VE
[1:29:16] GOT TO HAVE THIS. AND FRIENDS, THAT IS A
[1:29:18] RAZOR'S EDGE FROM REALITY.
[1:29:29] Back in Leviticus 23,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; remember
[1:29:36] when the field was there and crops were
[1:29:38] growing,
[1:29:40] they would go into the first ones that
[1:29:42] came to maturity and cut down a sheath.
[1:29:46] Amen.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; They would bring it to the house of God
[1:29:49] and the priest would wave it over the
[1:29:52] field
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; AS A PROMISE
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; THAT THERE WILL BE OTHERS IN THE FIELD
[1:29:58] THAT WOULD COME TO THE SAME LEVEL OF
[1:29:59] MATURITY.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE WAS WAVED OVER YOU.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; CHRIST WAS WAVED OVER YOU.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; NOT WILLIAM BRHAM, BUT CHRIST WAS WAVED
[1:30:14] OVER YOU. AMEN.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; WITH A PROMISE
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; THAT THERE'S OTHERS OUT IN THE FIELD
[1:30:22] THAT ARE GOING TO COME TO MATURITY
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; OF CHARACTER.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; HAD HE WRIGHT WAS JUST I'VE BEEN TO HER
[1:30:30] LITTLE PLACE, HUMBLE LITTLE PLACE.
[1:30:32] BROTHER BRHAM HAD $20 IN HIS POCKET THAT
[1:30:35] SHE HAD GIVEN AS an offering. He was
[1:30:38] COMING BACK TO HER LITTLE TRAILER TO
[1:30:40] GIVE IT BACK TO HER.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; That's what he was THERE FOR. AND THEY
[1:30:45] WERE TALKING ABOUT TESTIMONIES AND THE
[1:30:47] GOD OF HEALING AND THINGS. SHE'S SITTING
[1:30:49] OVER IN THE CORNER WITH HER TEENAGERS
[1:30:52] THAT WERE JUST LAUGHING AND THEY WERE
[1:30:54] JUST IN ANOTHER SPIRITUAL LEVEL LAUGHING
[1:30:57] AND ALL THIS AND CUTTING UP AND WHEN
[1:30:59] WHEN SHE HEARD THE WORD SHE SAID THAT IS
[1:31:01] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT IN THE 60S AND IN
[1:31:06] THE 50S THE ME BUT WE ARE NOT BACK
[1:31:08] THERE. THERE'S OTHER HADY WRITES THAT
[1:31:11] HAVE YOUNG MEN OR YOUNG LADIES OR HAVE
[1:31:13] NEEDS IN THEIR MARRIAGES OR IN THEIR
[1:31:15] FAMILY LIFE AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT IS
[1:31:17] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, LORD.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; How many know what that sword came down
[1:31:27] and brother Brandham's hand was a
[1:31:28] physical sword? I'D BEEN TO THE VERY
[1:31:31] SPOT IN SABINO CANYON where the light
[1:31:33] came through at I THINK IT WAS 10:10 IN
[1:31:36] THE MORNING and it only comes through
[1:31:37] THAT LITTLE PLACE AT THAT CERTAIN TIME.
[1:31:39] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS IN PRAYER and
[1:31:42] and THEN THE SWORD STRUCK HIS HAND.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; IT WAS A PHYSICAL SWORD.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; HE TURNED it and IT GLISTENED IN THE sun
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; and the word spoke to him and SAID,
[1:31:52] "THIS IS THE KING'S SWORD.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; It's the word."
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; God gave him that experience for his
[1:32:01] third pool.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM WALKED BACK
[1:32:03] OFF THAT MOUNTAIN, HE DIDN'T PICK UP
[1:32:06] CARRY THAT SWORD DOWN THERE AND THEN
[1:32:08] THROW IT INTO THE BACKSEAT OF HIS CAR
[1:32:10] AND THEN TAKE IT TO JEFFERSONVILLE to be
[1:32:12] some monument
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; for us to go to and worship. And that's
[1:32:16] THAT'S THE PHYSICAL SWORD. IT'S A
[1:32:18] SPIRITUAL SWORD.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; WHERE is that sword today?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:27] So I want everyone to just catch this.
[1:32:29] This is a major part of the message. In
[1:32:32] the Old Testament, when they CUT DOWN
[1:32:35] THE MATURE one and waved it over the
[1:32:37] field, it was a promise
[1:32:40] that THERE WOULD BE OTHERS COME TO THE
[1:32:42] SAME LEVEL of of
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, when you cut IT DOWN, THAT
[1:32:50] PART PASSED AWAY. IT WAS DEAD. YEAH,
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; CHRIST WAS CUT DOWN.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; He was waved OVER US, BUT HE ROSE.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; WILLIAM BRHAM AS A MESSENGER CARRIED THE
[1:33:01] WORD AND IT WAS WAVED OVER us
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; throughout the We have messages of
[1:33:06] brother Brandham.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Some might say, "Well, brother, I'm
[1:33:10] listening really close because I think
[1:33:12] that you're wanting us to leave the
[1:33:14] message." We're not leaving the message.
[1:33:17] We are the message. AMEN.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE SPOKE IN 1965
[1:33:22] HAS BECOME FLESH IN ME,
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; in you.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; It's the same seed. It's the same life.
[1:33:35] It's the same fruit.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And that sheath, now I'm quoting that.
[1:33:39] It is the rising of the sun and the
[1:33:41] first of your seed that you plant and
[1:33:43] when it comes up and ripens, you cut
[1:33:45] down this sheath and take it to the
[1:33:47] priest and let him take it and wave it
[1:33:49] before the Lord for your acceptance.
[1:33:57] He said there'll have to BE A SHEATH
[1:33:59] WAVED again in the last days. talking
[1:34:02] about waving of the sheath. The first
[1:34:05] one that come to mature. HE SAID
[1:34:07] MATURITY IS WAVED OVER US. Christ the
[1:34:10] word was WAVED OVER US. THAT IS A
[1:34:12] MESSAGE THAT THERE'S MORE LIKE THIS.
[1:34:15] THERE'S MORE LIKE ME TO COME.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; And here WE ARE IN THE FIELD of
[1:34:20] humanity. AND GOD HAS SAVED YOU. GOD HAS
[1:34:24] FILLED YOU. GOD HAS DELIVERED YOU,
[1:34:27] healed you, recovered you. AND SOME OF
[1:34:29] YOU THAT FEEL BROKEN AND SMASHED UP AND
[1:34:31] BRUISED, LET IT BE A TESTIMONY OUT OF
[1:34:34] YOUR MOUTH. I AM RECOVERING. GOD IS
[1:34:38] RECOVERING ALL IN MY LIFE.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; CAN THE CAMP SAY,
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; "AMEN."
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; IN 1ST SAMUEL 30:8, WHEN DAVID AND AND
[1:34:46] his men left ZIGLAG AND CAME BACK and
[1:34:49] his wives AND CHILDREN, ALL THE YOUNG
[1:34:51] PEOPLE were gone, the church was SMASHED
[1:34:53] UP.
[1:34:55] GOD GAVE HIM A PROMISE AND SAID WITHOUT
[1:34:58] FAIL YOU SHALL RECOVER ALL.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS YOU WILL NOT FAIL.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECOVER. MEANS I'M GOING TO
[1:35:09] DEFEND YOU. I'M GOING TO DELIVER YOU.
[1:35:12] I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE DRIVE OUT OF
[1:35:14] THE CAMP TODAY, THIS AFTERNOON, WE HAVE
[1:35:17] THESE PROMISES IN EARTHN VESSELS.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; MY GOD IS MY DEFENDER. HE'S MY
[1:35:22] PROTECTOR. IF I'M THE ONLY YOUNG PERSON,
[1:35:24] IF THERE'S ONLY THREE IN MY YOUTH GROUP,
[1:35:27] IF I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MY FAMILY, WE ARE
[1:35:30] YOUR FAMILY.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; WE ARE CHRIST TO ONE ANOTHER. WE ARE
[1:35:38] MERCY TO ONE ANOTHER. FRIENDS, YOU CAN
[1:35:40] TAKE ALL SIX SERVICES FROM this weekend.
[1:35:42] IT IS POSITIVE. IT IS POSITIVE. IT IS A
[1:35:45] POSITIVE TOKEN. BROTHER JONATHAN AND
[1:35:48] MYSELF. IT IS POSITIVE TOKEN. POSITIVE
[1:35:51] TOKEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM PREACHED TOKEN
[1:35:53] FOUR TIMES AND OUT OF THREE OUT OF THAT
[1:35:55] FOUR, I'M TALKING FAST, BUT HE SAID IT'S
[1:35:57] A POSITIVE TOKEN.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Stop dangling people over to hell with
[1:36:03] your carnal fleshly nature and your
[1:36:05] negative personality. We are not
[1:36:08] defeated. WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Our young PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THIS. OUR
[1:36:12] SISTERS NEED TO HEAR THIS.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, HONEY. LET'S GO.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You shall recover all means
[1:36:21] you shall escape. I'm going to pluck you
[1:36:23] out of that. I'M GOING TO RESCUE. I am
[1:36:25] here to rescue you. I'M GOING TO STRIP
[1:36:28] SATAN OF ALL HIS POWER.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; God is going to do this
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; through you.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going TO BRING YOU BACK FROM THE
[1:36:38] ENEMY. I'M GOING TO DELIVER YOU FROM
[1:36:40] YOUR SIN AND GUILT.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; You are greater THAN YOUR COMPLEXES. YOU
[1:36:44] ARE GREATER THAN THAT DEATH. YOU ARE
[1:36:46] GREATER THAN THAT SUICIDE. YOU ARE. THAT
[1:36:48] WAS MY BEST FRIEND.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; It was a deacon's wife. It was the
[1:36:56] pastor's grandson
[1:36:59] that found him.
[1:37:03] If we had more services, I could speak
[1:37:05] to you about personal things in our own
[1:37:07] lives or our family, what we've seen in
[1:37:09] the message. IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; No one said it's going to be easy. And
[1:37:17] we AND WE CAN LAUGH AND cheer and say,
[1:37:19] "Well, we got a few more minutes,
[1:37:21] Brother John, and we're going to GET OUT
[1:37:22] OF HERE." BUT WE ALL HAVE LIFE TO GO
[1:37:24] BACK TO. AND IT'S NOT EASY.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD HIS CROSS. THE
[1:37:29] MARTYRS HAD THEIR CROSS. THEY TOOK UP
[1:37:32] THEIR CROSS AND THEY FOLLOWED JESUS.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; YOUNG PEOPLE BACK DURING THAT MARTYR'S
[1:37:37] TIME AND THE UNDER THAT OX ANOINTING,
[1:37:39] THEY CAME TO THE STAKE AND THEY SAID,
[1:37:41] "YOU DON'T HAVE TO TIE ME HERE.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHAIN ME HERE. I'LL
[1:37:45] STAND HERE AND GIVE MY LIFE FOR CHRIST.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; I'M ASKING TODAY, WHERE ARE WE AT IN THE
[1:37:50] MESSAGE?
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; WE OUGHT TO HAVE YOUNG LADIES AND YOUNG
[1:37:53] MEN WILLINGLY SAY, I GIVE MY LIFE.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; NOT A DADDY OR A MOMMY OR SOMEBODY IN
[1:37:58] THE THIRD ROW BACK SAYING, "YOU NEED TO
[1:38:00] GET TO THE ALTAR. YOU NEED PRAYER. YOU
[1:38:02] LET THE HOLY GHOST DO THAT."
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; WE'VE HAD TOO MUCH IMPERSONATION AND AND
[1:38:06] PEOPLE DRAG PEOPLE THIS AND THAT. BE
[1:38:08] QUIET. YOU MAKE SURE IT'S THE HOLY
[1:38:10] SPIRIT.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; I'm using money in the bank. Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; But I'm withdrawing it, too. HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:18] WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECOVER ALL, NOT PART, but
[1:38:22] inclusive
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; yourself, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR LOVED ONES.
[1:38:27] AND THE BIBLE SAYS IN 1ST SAMUEL 30,
[1:38:30] DAVID RECOVERED ALL.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; VERSE 18, VERSE 19, THERE WAS NOTHING
[1:38:35] LACKING.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; You have A LACK THIS THIS MORNING, THIS
[1:38:39] AFTERNOON, JUST COMMIT THAT TO GOD. WHEN
[1:38:42] CHRIST ROSE ON SUNDAY, HE WAVED GOODBYE.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; I'm quoting out of it is the rising of
[1:38:50] the sun, paragraph 36. He rose on Easter
[1:38:54] and he waved goodbye. HE WAS THAT SHE
[1:38:57] WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT CAME TO MATURITY.
[1:39:00] IT WAS WAVED. IT WAS A SIGN. HE WAS
[1:39:04] WAVED OVER US. THE WORD WAVED.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU LISTENING?
[1:39:12] THAT WORD AGAIN IS WAVED OVER THE
[1:39:14] PEOPLE. IT WAS THE FIRST FRUITS OF THOSE
[1:39:18] THAT SLEPT IN THE BRIDE COMING OF
[1:39:21] CHRIST. NOW HE'S TALKING IT IS THE
[1:39:23] RISING OF THE SUN IN THE BRIDE COMING OF
[1:39:27] CHRIST. 1965
[1:39:31] I have it is the rising of the sun right
[1:39:33] here.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; He said I'm concerned.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; HE SAID
[1:39:41] THAT IT'S TOO MUCH OF US ARE NOT GETTING
[1:39:43] people to Christ.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; We're getting them to church.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; We're getting them TO RULES.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; WE FORCE OUR CHILDREN. WE WE WANT TO
[1:39:51] MAKE THEM BELIEVERS SO HARD. WE WANT
[1:39:53] THEM TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. LET ME TELL
[1:39:55] YOU WHAT, FRIENDS. God's works are
[1:39:58] stronger than our works. AND EVEN THE
[1:40:01] WEAKEST OF GOD AND THE FOOLISHNESS OF
[1:40:03] GOD IS GREATER THAN MAN.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; There's no better hands TO COMMIT THEM
[1:40:09] TO. BUT THE LOVELY HANDS OF THE LORD
[1:40:11] JESUS CHRIST THAT SHED HIS BLOOD AND
[1:40:13] GAVE HIS LIFE AND REACHED OUT HIS HANDS.
[1:40:17] HE COULD HAVE CALLED 10 THOU. I'M
[1:40:18] PREACHING UNDER INSPIRATION RIGHT NOW.
[1:40:20] COULD HAVE CALLED 10,000 ANGELS. JUST A
[1:40:23] MOVE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THE ANGELS
[1:40:25] WERE SITTING ON EVERY TREE BRANCH JUST
[1:40:27] LISTENING SAYING, "GET ME DOWN OFF OF
[1:40:29] HERE." AND IT WAS LOVE.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; IT WAS LOVE THAT HELD HIM THERE.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; AND THAT SAME LOVE IS IN YOU
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; ALL THE WAY TO THE END. HE'LL GIVE YOU
[1:40:39] WISDOM. HE'LL GIVE YOU LEADERSHIP. YOU
[1:40:41] ARE NOT ALONE.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; LOOK TO YOUR NEIGHBOR AND SAY, "YOU ARE
[1:40:49] NOT ALONE."
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; You are not alone.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You're not alone.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Stop talking in church. Amen. No.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Just listen to the word now. Listen to
[1:41:06] the word.
[1:41:09] Page 19, Brother Brandham SAID, "IN THE
[1:41:11] BRIDE COMING OF CHRIST, THERE'LL BE A
[1:41:13] SHEATH waved again in the last days."
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; IN THE BRIDE AGE, SPEAKING TO HIS WIFE,
[1:41:18] PARAGRAPH 42, WHAT A RESURRECTION THAT
[1:41:21] THAT WAS. AND WHAT A RESURRECTION THIS
[1:41:23] IS.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; SAY 1965, WHAT A RISING OF THE SUN THAT
[1:41:28] WAS. BUT 2025, WHAT A RESURRECTION THIS
[1:41:31] HAS BEEN.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT A GLORY OF GOD. I SEE ON YOUR
[1:41:34] FACES.
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:40] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Here we are friends
[1:41:45] living in a season, living in a time.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; So here we have in front of us today
[1:42:02] this baton. Brother John brought it all
[1:42:04] the way from America. This is a short
[1:42:07] stick. It's a tube that is passed from
[1:42:10] one runner to another runner in a relay
[1:42:12] race.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; If you notice here, it's very light.
[1:42:15] It's not a Jesus said, "My yoke is easy
[1:42:18] and my burden is light." Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; And when you notice in a relay race, and
[1:42:23] there's different relay races that you
[1:42:26] know from school and things,
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; but I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE OLD
[1:42:32] GENERATION AND THE NEW GENERATION.
[1:42:35] The baton is in your hands.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And if I HAD ANOTHER MESSAGE, I WOULD
[1:42:39] HAVE SPOKE ON trusting the new
[1:42:42] generation.
[1:42:44] Not just encouraging them,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST SUPPORTING THEM,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST LOVING THEM, NOT JUST BEING
[1:42:51] GOOD EXAMPLES or leading or guiding or
[1:42:53] sponsoring them, but trusting them.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; ALLOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT TO LEAD THEM.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE PURPOSE.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; He knows the calling. HE KNOWS the seed.
[1:43:08] Yeah.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Our services
[1:43:11] MUST BE DECLARING OUR CHURCH GATHERINGS
[1:43:14] and meetings MORE THAN JUST CURRENT
[1:43:16] POLITICS, CURRENT EVENTS, WHAT'S
[1:43:19] HAPPENING in Israel or Iran or the Pope
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; and all the debates that go on and all
[1:43:24] the riots and all the looting and all
[1:43:27] the things that COMES IN YOUR ALGORITHMS
[1:43:29] ON YOUR news channels. ALL THE KILLING,
[1:43:31] ALL THE MURDER, ALL THE VIOLENCE HAS
[1:43:33] CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE PREPARING PEOPLE
[1:43:36] FOR A TRIBULATION ON ONE SIDE. ON THE
[1:43:38] OTHER SIDE, WE HAVE THE WORD THAT'S BEEN
[1:43:40] MOLDING AND MINISTERING AND I'LL NEVER
[1:43:43] LEAVE YOU. I'LL NEVER FORSAKE YOU.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; You are not alone. YOU ARE NOT
[1:43:47] FORGOTTEN.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT YOU GO THROUGH, NO MATTER
[1:43:50] HELL HAS BEEN THE THE THE LID HAS BEEN
[1:43:53] TAKEN OFF.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; WE ARE FACING HELL. WE'RE DRIVING OUT OF
[1:43:59] HERE ON THIS MONDAY. HAPPY LABOR DAY,
[1:44:02] NEW ZEALAND. BUT WE'RE FACING HELL OUT
[1:44:04] THERE.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; AGAIN, I remind you, Brother Jonathan
[1:44:10] and our wives and myself, we we'll get
[1:44:13] on airplanes in a few minutes and just
[1:44:15] one of the segments is 13 hours for me.
[1:44:18] 14. One of just one of their segments is
[1:44:20] 14 hours. JUST ONE. THEN THEY GO
[1:44:23] ANOTHER. WE CAN'T. THERE'S HOURS and
[1:44:25] hours, AIRPORTS, MONEY, THOUSANDS OF
[1:44:27] DOLLARS. JUST TO BRING THREE SERVICES
[1:44:29] EACH.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; So this baton,
[1:44:41] there's something that is amazing.
[1:44:44] Brother David, just step up here just
[1:44:45] for a moment. So the old generation has
[1:44:48] ran their course. This is now THEIR THE
[1:44:50] LAST PART OF THE RACE. And there's
[1:44:53] something called an area in the middle
[1:44:55] here. IT'S CALLED THE TIMES OF
[1:44:57] TRANSITION.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; TIMES OF TRANSITION FROM THE OLDER
[1:45:01] GENERATION to the new generation.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; AND SO THE NEW GENERATION, they they
[1:45:05] WAIT IN THIS AREA WITH LIKE THIS WITH
[1:45:08] THEIR HANDS OUT. ARE YOU watching back
[1:45:09] here? Israel or David?
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; David. David. AND YOU'RE READY LIKE
[1:45:15] THIS. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING BACK. YOU'RE
[1:45:17] NOT. BUT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON YOUR PART OF
[1:45:19] THE RACE.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; So can your posture just get in that?
[1:45:22] Just this hand. Yes. That hand back.
[1:45:24] Open. Open up wide. Yep. AND HERE I'VE
[1:45:28] COME. WE'VE HAD A GENERATION THAT'S GONE
[1:45:30] BEFORE US. WILLIAM BRANDHAM. OUR P MANY
[1:45:32] PASTORS AND LEADERS, CHURCHES IN NEW
[1:45:34] ZEALAND HAVE RUN THEIR COURSE.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE COMING AND THEY'RE SWEATY
[1:45:38] AND THEY'RE TIRED AND THEY'RE WEARY AND
[1:45:40] AND OUR DUTY IS TO JUST PASS THIS RIGHT
[1:45:42] INTO THEIR HAND. AND NOW YOU RUN,
[1:45:44] BROTHER DAVID. YOU GO.
[1:45:47] [Applause]
[1:45:53] Is that is that light? It's not a heavy
[1:45:56] load. I didn't give you some big brick
[1:45:58] or log, did I? Let's do it one more time
[1:46:00] quickly.
[1:46:02] So, here I've RAN MY COURSE. I'VE HAD MY
[1:46:04] SONG LEADING. IT'S TIME FOR SOME OF US
[1:46:06] TO HAND OVER THE SONG LEADING, the
[1:46:08] preaching, BEING A DEACON
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; TO THE NEW GENERATION.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; The transition has been a failure in a
[1:46:17] lot of places in the message.
[1:46:21] And they run around and they just want
[1:46:22] to do it better. That can do it better.
[1:46:24] You're I see that you're not ready for
[1:46:26] that. You're this and and that's they
[1:46:27] just want to run. The old generation
[1:46:29] wants to keep running till they die.
[1:46:31] Till they JUST FALL INTO THE I'LL DIE
[1:46:32] WITH MY BOOTS ON. THEY SAY,
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; "OH, come on."
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; They feel like if they'd ever retire,
[1:46:40] that they're letting down on God when
[1:46:42] really it's a failure to have trust
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; that the same God that led me
[1:46:49] And now I'm running. I'm running. And
[1:46:51] brother David and And he just reaches
[1:46:53] behind and he just runs and and the
[1:46:55] baton is passed.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; But one of the worst THINGS THAT CAN
[1:47:04] HAPPEN IS THE DROPPING OF THE BATON.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD BE FASTER.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; You could be better.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; You could be stronger.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; You could have more money. You could
[1:47:16] look better.
[1:47:18] BUT TO DROP THE BATON. AND I WANT TO ASK
[1:47:20] THE QUESTION HERE IN NEW Zealand
[1:47:23] as WE PASS THE BATON TO THE NEW
[1:47:25] GENERATION. HOW are we doing?
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; The last message before we all go home
[1:47:30] from the family camp as individuals, as
[1:47:33] families, as a church within the message
[1:47:35] locally and globally. How are we doing
[1:47:38] in passing that baton? Then h how the
[1:47:41] older generation is passing. How are we
[1:47:44] doing?
[1:47:49] But then the new generation,
[1:47:52] how are you doing in receiving?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; This is one of the biggest complaints
[1:48:00] against the new generation and that is a
[1:48:02] lack of character.
[1:48:05] They feel entitled.
[1:48:07] They just feel like it's going to happen
[1:48:08] overnight. It's going to be easy. And
[1:48:10] the old generation sees that lack of
[1:48:12] fiber and lack of character. So they
[1:48:14] want to keep the baton. But we must
[1:48:16] trust the new generation.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; We must nurture them.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Glory
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; into THEIR SPIRITUAL ADOPTION,
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; ALLOWING THEM TO FLEX THEIR EAGLE WINGS
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE
[1:48:34] OLD GENERATION. NOW, THIS TAKES
[1:48:37] CHARACTER AND MATURITY FROM THE BOTH OF
[1:48:39] THE GENERATIONS. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A
[1:48:42] QUESTION QUICKLY. ARE YOU WILLING TO
[1:48:44] GROW WITH OTHERS
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; INTO THE CAPSTONE?
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE DIFFERENT DIFFERENCES OF
[1:48:51] ADMINISTRATION. PAUL SAID IN 1
[1:48:53] CORINTHIANS 12, there are diversities.
[1:48:56] Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; In Psalm 78:1-4,
[1:49:01] the Bible talks about how that we are to
[1:49:04] show to THE GENERATION TO COME THE
[1:49:07] PRAISES OF THE Lord and his strength and
[1:49:10] his wonderful works that he hath done.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Not the negative,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; NOT CHURCH POLITICS, NOT FAMILY
[1:49:20] FAVORITISM. RIGHT?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; We have family churches in the message
[1:49:25] and they just pass it off to their son
[1:49:26] or their grandson. Sometimes there's
[1:49:28] another brother or another gift in the
[1:49:30] church that's actually a better pastoral
[1:49:33] or way with the people. People because
[1:49:35] they're so tied into money and their
[1:49:37] legacy and their name.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; God help us, Lord.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; And then PEOPLE BEGIN TO GIVE
[1:49:42] UNRIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT AND TAINTED WISDOM
[1:49:45] BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT. IT'S AMAZING
[1:49:48] HOW PEOPLE WILL QUICKLY FORGIVE PEOPLE
[1:49:50] IN THEIR OWN FAMILY. That's my friend.
[1:49:52] But if it's another CHURCH OR ANOTHER
[1:49:54] GROUP, THEY'LL QUICKLY EX them out.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you don't have that in New
[1:49:59] Zealand.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT TO KEEP PUTTING A LACK OF
[1:50:04] UNDERSTANDING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.
[1:50:07] THERE OUGHT TO BE MORE WISDOM,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; NOT SARCASM.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE'S VERY CLEAR IN PSALM 78. SHOW
[1:50:16] THE GENERATION TO COME THE PRAISES OF
[1:50:18] the Lord and his strength and his
[1:50:20] wonderful works.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; We are not TO CREATE A PARTY SPIRIT
[1:50:25] ATMOSPHERE.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; We're passing through Leodysia. WE ARE
[1:50:32] NOT PART OF LEODYSIA. WE'RE NOT TO JUST
[1:50:34] PASS OFF LEGALISM AND UNBALANCED
[1:50:37] TEACHING AND DOMINATING FAMILY STRAINS.
[1:50:40] WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:50:44] that we WOULD GIVE THE NEW generation as
[1:50:46] Psalm 78:5 that WE WOULD MAKE THESE
[1:50:49] THINGS KNOWN TO THEIR CHILDREN THAT
[1:50:51] VERSE 6 THE GENERATION TO COME MIGHT
[1:50:53] KNOW THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR
[1:50:56] CHILDREN THAT'S YOUR GRANDCHILDREN THAT
[1:50:58] THEY MIGHT SET THEIR HOPE IN THE LORD
[1:51:00] ARE YOU AWAKE THIS THIS MORNING
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; SET YOUR HOPE IN THE LORD MY HOPE IS IN
[1:51:06] THE LORD
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; NOT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS NOT HOLLYWOOD
[1:51:10] NOT AI
[1:51:14] AI IS NOT OUR LEADER. THE HOLY GHOST IS
[1:51:16] OUR LEADER.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; NOT THEIR DEGREES OR CERTIFICATES OR
[1:51:20] THEIR NATIONAL SPIRIT OR PRIME MINISTER.
[1:51:22] OUR HOPE IS IN THE LORD. NOT IN
[1:51:24] BUSINESS. NOT IN BUSINESS. NOT IN THE
[1:51:27] ECONOMY. NOT IN THE STOCK MARKET. IT IS
[1:51:29] NOT IN OUR HUMAN FRIENDSHIPS OR OUR
[1:51:31] RELATIONSHIPS. PEOPLE WILL FAIL YOU.
[1:51:34] CHURCHES WILL FAIL YOU. MINISTRY WILL
[1:51:37] FAIL YOU. BUT JESUS NEVER FAILS.
[1:51:42] IN THE NAME OF JESUS, HE HAS NEVER
[1:51:44] FAILED YOU.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; HE HAS NEVER FAILED YOU.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Brother John's 53 years old. My wife's
[1:51:52] birthday is a few days. She'll be 54. I
[1:51:55] married an older lady. Amen. She'll take
[1:51:57] care of you better. BUT WE COULD WE'VE
[1:51:59] SAW SO MUCH IN OUR LIFETIME TRAVELING
[1:52:01] FROM AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND living
[1:52:04] in America, and this church and that
[1:52:05] church and all that WE'VE SEEN IN THE
[1:52:08] MESSAGE. BUT OUR HOPE IS IN THE LORD.
[1:52:13] WHEN YOU'RE AROUND BROTHER JOHN OR
[1:52:15] SISTER SHARON, WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF
[1:52:16] NEGATIVE TALKERS and slanderers.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; I I I JUST CHALLENGE YOU WHEN YOU'VE
[1:52:21] BEEN AROUND BROTHER JONATHAN MARTIN OR
[1:52:23] HIS WIFE. HAS ANY OF YOU HEARD JUST GONE
[1:52:26] ON AND ON AND ON ABOUT THIS CHURCH, that
[1:52:28] church, THIS DOCTRINE, THAT THIS NO,
[1:52:30] IT'S POSITIVE.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; THEN IT'S NOT JUST IN WILLIAM BRHAM.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST IN JESUS WHEN HE WALKED IN
[1:52:40] EARTH. IT'S NOT JUST IN MOODY AND FINNY
[1:52:42] AND ALL THESE GREAT PRE. IT'S NOT. IT'S
[1:52:44] IN THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; WE ARE 2025, MY FRIENDS.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOOKING BACK.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Brother John has sought to allow this
[1:52:56] type of atmosphere to be in the
[1:52:58] meetings.
[1:53:00] Not reaching down, not just always, you
[1:53:04] know, LOOKING DOWN ON PEOPLE. And and
[1:53:06] from the old generation to the new
[1:53:08] generation, there ought to be a respect.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; I ran my course. I I'M DOING WHAT I CAN.
[1:53:14] I I DON'T HAVE IT ALL. I CAN'T MEET ALL
[1:53:16] YOUR NEEDS. AND I'M SORRY FINANCIALLY.
[1:53:23] If you would counsel or want A WORD WITH
[1:53:25] SOMEONE, WE'RE NOT A PROPHET
[1:53:28] OR BROTHER JONATHAN SAID SONS OF A
[1:53:30] PROPHET. BUT IF YOU LOOK IN THE
[1:53:32] SCRIPTURE, A LOT OF PROPHETS FAMILIES
[1:53:35] RAN INTO TROUBLE.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; SO STOP ASPIRING TO BE A SON OF A
[1:53:39] PROPHET, TO PROPHESY, TO HAVE DREAMS.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS ONE MAN THAT WANTED TO HAVE
[1:53:44] DREAM. OH, I WISH I COULD HAVE A VISION.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham reached his hand over
[1:53:50] on his shoulder and say, "Every time you
[1:53:51] open your Bible, you see a vision."
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; What are YOU LOOKING FOR? WHAT DO YOU
[1:53:57] WANT OUT OF CHURCH?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; SAY, "I WANT A CHURCH FULL OF PERFECT
[1:54:00] PEOPLE." WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT.
[1:54:02] THERE'S NO CHURCH PERFECT IN NEW
[1:54:04] ZEALAND.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, SOME OF YOU STREAM FROM OTHER
[1:54:08] COUNTRIES. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING
[1:54:10] ON BEHIND THE SCENES.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT IS OFFENDED WHEN WE MAKE
[1:54:21] MEN OUR SUPERSTARS. HE'S OFFENDED WHEN
[1:54:24] WE PUT THOSE THINGS ABOVE HIM. AND HE
[1:54:26] WILL CRASH DOWN YOUR KINGDOM. HE WILL
[1:54:28] HUMBLE AND BREAK YOU FOR YOU TO LOOK UP
[1:54:31] TO SEEK HIM.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; We need to take care. Our revival IS NOT
[1:54:40] THE CHURCH BARBECUE.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Every generation deserves their chance
[1:54:44] AT THE WORD. OUR REVIVAL IS NOT A CHURCH
[1:54:47] SOFTBALL TEAM. IT'S NOT A POLITICAL
[1:54:49] PARTY THAT we finally GET IN OFFICE
[1:54:51] THAT'S more conservative and we say,
[1:54:52] "HALLELUJAH." NO, IT'S NOT ALL
[1:54:54] HALLELUJAH. EVERY COUNTRY, EVERY NATION
[1:54:57] IS CONTROLLED BY THE DEVIL.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; OUR REVIVAL IS NOT RELIGION. OUR REVIVAL
[1:55:03] IS NOT A SLOGAN OR A CERTAIN CHANT OR
[1:55:05] CERTAIN QUOTES, HIT QUOTES THAT WE JUST
[1:55:08] SAY OUT AND THEN HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:09] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; OUR REVIVAL IS NOT OUR HEALTH.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Some of you are healthy and strong RIGHT
[1:55:21] NOW.
[1:55:23] SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN BEFORE YOU GET
[1:55:24] HOME, BEFORE I GET HOME.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; And in less THAN ONE WEEK,
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD BE PUT DOWN INTO THE GROUND.
[1:55:31] AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE AND YOUR
[1:55:33] BEAUTIFUL BODY AND YOUR STRONG MUSCLES,
[1:55:36] THE SKIN WORMS THAT'S ALREADY IN YOU
[1:55:38] WOULD HAVE ALREADY ATE IT UP IN ONE
[1:55:40] WEEK. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST JUST
[1:55:42] NOTHING BUT ASHES.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE SO GREAT. WE'RE SO BIG. NO,
[1:55:46] YOU'RE NOT.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; God will break you. You start thinking
[1:55:50] like that. Say, "I'LL LIVE LIKE THE
[1:55:53] WORLD. I'LL ACT LIKE THE WORLD. AIN'T my
[1:55:54] earring so beautiful? Ain't this makeup
[1:55:56] MAKE ME? ISN'T THIS TATTOO so nice?"
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE JUST MARKING YOURSELF LIKE
[1:56:02] THE WORLD MARKS THEMSELVES.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; MY HOW THE WORLD WANTED TO MARK US.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; BUT HOW GOD WANTS TO MARK US.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; HOW HE WANTS TO IMPRINT HIS NATURE UPON
[1:56:14] OUR HEART.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; SAY, "I want another book of Acts. I
[1:56:18] want another book of Acts." Well, in the
[1:56:20] book of Acts, there was struggle. THERE
[1:56:21] WERE FIGHTING.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; BROTHERS COULDN'T HARDLY AGREE. There
[1:56:24] were THINGS GOING ON. A REVIVAL IS NOT
[1:56:27] HAVING A BOYFRIEND OR A GIRLFRIEND.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; THE REVIVAL THAT THE BRIDE NEEDS IS NOT
[1:56:32] MUSIC
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; or building a new church.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; THE REVIVAL IN THE NEW ARE WE DOING
[1:56:40] OKAY?
[1:56:42] IN THE NEW GENERATION WILL BE A
[1:56:44] BORNAGAIN EXPERIENCE FILLED WITH THE
[1:56:46] HOLY GHOST, WALKING IN THEIR OWN
[1:56:49] PERSONAL ADOPTION, WHICH IS MATURITY AS
[1:56:52] THEY COME TO THE HEADSTONE AND AS THEY
[1:56:55] NEAR HIM AND HE CUTS OFF ALL THE THINGS
[1:56:58] THAT'S NOT LIKE HIM AND THE STATURE OF A
[1:57:00] PERFECT MAN IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFE.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; NOT MY CHURCH BELIEVES THIS, MY MOMMY
[1:57:07] BELIEVES THIS, MY THAT'S A BUNCH OF
[1:57:08] NONSENSE. Your revelation is being
[1:57:11] reflected in your life. WHAT YOU DO THIS
[1:57:13] NEXT WEEK AND IN THE WEEKS TO FOLLOW
[1:57:16] SHOW WHETHER YOU REALLY CAUGHT THE WORD
[1:57:18] OR NOT.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Are we getting one another's spirit or
[1:57:25] are we getting the Holy Spirit?
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; I have a whole page of quotes on the old
[1:57:31] fighters. Brother Renham said get away
[1:57:34] from the old fighters disposition. All
[1:57:37] the old fighters is gone now. But your
[1:57:39] sword, put your sword back in its
[1:57:41] sheath.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; He's talking about fighting. They
[1:57:44] fought. They fought. THEY FOUGHT. PUT
[1:57:46] YOUR SWORD BACK IN ITS SHEATH.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; He said it would be the sons of the old
[1:57:52] fighters. These fellows are not
[1:57:54] fighters. THE NEW GROUP, YOU can just
[1:57:56] just go look IT UP. THESE FELLAS ARE NOT
[1:57:59] FIGHTERS. THE NEW GROUP WASN'T FIGHTERS.
[1:58:02] HE LET ALL THE OLD FIGHTERS DIE OFF.
[1:58:06] In another PLACE, HE SAID, "WE'RE READY
[1:58:07] TO DO IT WHEN YOU sons of the old
[1:58:09] fighters get together."
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Brother John has sought to
[1:58:18] bring this over the years that we've
[1:58:20] been with you. Here's a good scripture
[1:58:22] for us. Hebrews 4:12. For the word of
[1:58:26] God is quick and powerful, sharper than
[1:58:29] any two-edged sword, piercing even to
[1:58:31] the dividing aunderder of soul and
[1:58:33] spirit and joints in the marrow, and is
[1:58:35] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:58:37] of the heart.
[1:58:39] It's 11:51
[1:58:51] as we go
[1:58:54] to each one of you personally. I just
[1:58:56] want to have you personally in a room.
[1:59:00] He is our daily bread.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; WE SPEAK ABOUT DAILY BREAD. I KNOW SOME
[1:59:06] OF YOU ARE on keto, Tito,
[1:59:10] wheat free,
[1:59:12] dairy free,
[1:59:14] carnivore, hunore,
[1:59:17] whatever diets. I'm not speaking
[1:59:18] negatively about it. I'm just talking
[1:59:21] about he is our daily bread
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit is the shepherd to
[1:59:28] feed you sheep food from this word.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Let's all finish strong today. You can
[1:59:32] say amen as we go. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS
[1:59:36] THE SHEPHERD TO FEED YOU SHEEP FOOD.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; IT ALWAYS COMES BY THE SHEPHERD. He is
[1:59:41] our shepherd.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Listen to him.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE SHEEP OF HIS FOE.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; If you are, you hear HIS VOICE,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; NOT WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE SAYS. YOU HEAR
[1:59:54] WHAT HE SAYS.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; A STRANGE VOICE YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; DO WE HAVE THE HOLY GHOST?
[2:00:03] DO WE HAVE THE HOLY GHOST?
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; THEY THAT ARE THE SONS OF GOD ARE LED BY
[2:00:08] THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; If you're A DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU ARE LED
[2:00:14] BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; A CREED IS ALL RIGHT, BUT IT JUST
[2:00:18] DOESN'T SATISFY TILL YOU GET DOWN TO THE
[2:00:20] WORD. MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE,
[2:00:22] BUT EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDTH OUT OF THE
[2:00:24] MOUTH of God. WE'RE GOING TO EAT LUNCH.
[2:00:26] MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE TO GO BEFORE
[2:00:28] LUNCH. BUT WE LIVE NOT BY JUST THE
[2:00:31] NATURAL FOOD THAT WE EAT OR THE DRINKS
[2:00:34] THAT WE DRINK. WE LIVE BY THE WORD.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; AND LORD, GIVE US REVELATION MORE THAN
[2:00:40] EVER AS WE LEAVE THIS CAMP, LORD, IN OUR
[2:00:42] DEVOTIONS, IN OUR HOMES, IN OUR
[2:00:45] CHURCHES. MAY THERE BE A FRESH BAPTISM.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; I'M ASKING YOU, LORD, BEFORE WE LEAVE
[2:00:50] THIS PLACE, THAT'S WHAT WE LIVE BY. THE
[2:00:53] WORD OF GOD IS A MAN'S SPIRITUAL DAILY
[2:00:55] BREAD.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; If you want to mark down this scripture,
[2:00:58] this is incredible SCRIPTURE. I HAVE
[2:01:00] THIS MESSAGE proving his word right HERE
[2:01:03] IN THESE FEW VERSES. YOU HAVE THE OLD
[2:01:05] GENERATION AND THE NEW GENERATION. YOU
[2:01:08] HAVE A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL, GYRUS'S
[2:01:10] DAUGHTER, THAT PASSES AWAY. YOU HAVE A
[2:01:12] ONE THAT'S SENIOR going through midlife
[2:01:14] and and her cycle is ending. She's going
[2:01:17] through a menopause, AN ISSUE WITH
[2:01:19] BLOOD. AND THE BIBLE SAYS SHE HAD IT FOR
[2:01:22] 12 YEARS.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; SO THE VERY YEAR THAT A YOUNG PERSON WAS
[2:01:26] BORN, A SISTER STARTED TO HAVE TROUBLE.
[2:01:29] And then THE 12YEAR-OLD GIRL, SHE GREW
[2:01:31] AND SHE DIED. You say, "All hope IS
[2:01:33] GONE. THE SITUATION'S DEAD." BROTHER
[2:01:35] JOHN, THERE'S NO LIFE. THERE'S NO LOVE.
[2:01:37] THERE'S NO FEELING. THERE'S NOTHING
[2:01:39] ANYMORE. AND HE'S DEAD IN A TOMB. AND
[2:01:42] THEY ALL BEGIN TO WHAIL AND CRY. JESUS
[2:01:44] PUT THEM ALL OUT. SAID, "I CAN'T HAVE
[2:01:46] UNBELIEF AROUND ME. I JUST WANT
[2:01:48] BELIEVERS THAT'LL TAKE ME OUT BY WORD."
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; YOU ALL KNOW THE STORY. HE RAISED HER
[2:01:53] UP.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; AND THE WOMAN THAT TOUCHED THE BORDER OF
[2:01:56] HIS GARMENT WAS CLEANSED.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; FROM THAT VERY MOMENT.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; No matter what you're going through, the
[2:02:08] promises of the word are true. YAY. AND
[2:02:10] AMEN. I SHALL BE CHANGED
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; IN A MOMENT, IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE.
[2:02:17] COMFORT ONE ANOTHER WITH THESE WORDS.
[2:02:19] IT'S THE COMING OF THE LORD. WE'VE APPE
[2:02:22] WE'VE RECEIVED THE SHOUT. THE SHOUT IS A
[2:02:24] MESSAGE TO GATHER US ALL TOGETHER. THAT
[2:02:27] IS THE BRIDE'S REVIVAL.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; In 1 John 4:4, greater is he that is in
[2:02:35] you THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. AMEN.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; BRIDE OF CHRIST. WHAT COMES INTO YOUR
[2:02:41] MIND WHEN you see THESE PICTURES?
[2:02:43] BROTHER JOHN BROUGHT IT ALL THE WAY TO
[2:02:45] TO JUST LET IT BE AN EXAMPLE IN FRONT OF
[2:02:47] YOU. WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET
[2:02:49] YOUR ATTENTION ON CHRIST.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; WHETHER IT'S BY DEMONSTRATION, WHETHER
[2:02:53] IT'S BY TESTIMONY, WHETHER IT'S BY
[2:02:55] POWERPOINT, WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING
[2:02:56] PHYSICAL, BUT NOW IT'S IN YOUR HANDS.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO GO. MY WIFE'S GOT TO GO.
[2:03:03] BROTHER JONATHAN'S GOING TO GO, SISTER
[2:03:05] LO, BUT YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF NEW
[2:03:07] ZEALAND.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; RECEIVE THE BATON. THE BATON IS IN YOUR
[2:03:13] HAND. THE BIBLE SAYS IN EXODUS 4, THE
[2:03:16] LORD SAID UNTO HIM, "WHAT IS THAT IN THY
[2:03:18] HAND?"
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; AND HERE WE HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD FOR
[2:03:23] OUR DAY. THE OPENING OF THE SEALS IS
[2:03:25] CHRIST.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; THE SEVEN CHURCH AGES WAS THE FEMALE.
[2:03:29] THE SEVEN SEALS IS THE MALE. THERE'S
[2:03:31] BEEN AN INVISIBLE UNION. THERE'S BEEN A
[2:03:34] PASSING OF THE BATON. THERE'S A
[2:03:36] RECEIVING OF THE BATON. I HAVE IT IN MY
[2:03:38] HANDS.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; I thank God for faithful MEN AND WOMEN
[2:03:43] THAT'S GONE BEFORE US, BUT THE BATON IS
[2:03:45] IN MY HANDS.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; And Lord, help us not to DROP IT. HELP
[2:03:49] US, LORD. IN THE NATURAL, IT LOOKS LIKE
[2:03:51] THIS, BUT IN THE SPIRITUAL, WE'VE
[2:03:53] RECEIVED THE GOSPEL MESSAGE. HELP US NOW
[2:03:55] TO CLOSE. IT'S THE WORD FOR OUR AGE.
[2:03:58] IT'S THE MESSENGER THAT'S PASSED IT INTO
[2:04:00] YOUR HANDS.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECEIVED IT AND WE HAVE A
[2:04:06] RESPONSIBILITY TO RUN.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; TO PASS IT IS A RESPONSIBILITY. TO
[2:04:12] RECEIVE IT IS a responsibility.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT IN TIMES OF
[2:04:16] TRANSITION AND AT JUNCTIONS OF TIME ARE
[2:04:19] SO CRUCIAL. IT'S BEEN A PROBLEM OF EVERY
[2:04:21] AGE. LET'S STAND TO OUR FEET. WE HAVE
[2:04:23] COME TO THE END. WE HAVE COME TO THE
[2:04:26] END.
[2:04:31] And 2025
[2:04:34] is not 1965.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; There's been a rising of the sun.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; I'm on my last slide there.
[2:04:46] In the name of Jesus.
[2:04:50] When he said you are his victory, then
[2:04:52] you're not defeated.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; You're not a backslider.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might have went through this
[2:04:58] whole week and not have felt anything.
[2:05:00] You might be going home saying,"Lord,
[2:05:02] I'm nervous. I'm I'm shaking. I don't
[2:05:04] even know what's going to happen when I
[2:05:05] get home. I don't even know what's going
[2:05:07] to happen in my job. What's going to
[2:05:08] happen in my marriage?"
[2:05:12] You might be a miserable failure as a
[2:05:14] spouse. YOU MIGHT BE A YOUNG PERSON THAT
[2:05:16] SAYS, "BROTHER JOHN, I'm hearing all
[2:05:17] you're saying. BROTHER JONATHAN, I LOVE
[2:05:19] YOU,
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; but you don't know me. You don't know
[2:05:22] what we go through here in New Zealand,
[2:05:25] but there's one that knows everything.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; He knows the future as much as he knows
[2:05:29] the past.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; He sends DIVINE GIFTS LIKE YOU'VE HAD
[2:05:33] THIS weekend to show his love for you.

[2:24:49] And on the day of judgment, my thoughts
[2:24:51] will play back and you'll see that's the
[2:24:53] truth because I know that they're called
[2:24:55] of the Lord.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; And and and you know, when you Yeah.
[2:24:59] It's just it's good to value servants.
[2:25:01] You got to value everyone. And then it
[2:25:03] says, "But those that are work for the
[2:25:04] Lord are worthy of double honor." So
[2:25:06] it's Yeah. Good little tip in life. Yes.
[2:25:10] Um say, just one other thing. So there's
[2:25:12] a after this um there's the our there's
[2:25:16] the um get after party at the pizza
[2:25:19] factory. Um we've got like there's like
[2:25:23] all sorts of stuff there. There's like
[2:25:24] pizzas. No, I think I should say there's
[2:25:26] burgers. If I say there's burgers, cuz
[2:25:28] we do pizza, burgers, Mexican and stuff,
[2:25:30] but if I say there's going to be
[2:25:32] something, then everyone's going to
[2:25:34] expect it. So, the people that are
[2:25:35] making it will have to make it cuz they
[2:25:36] don't want to make it. They just want to
[2:25:37] make pizzas
[2:25:40] cuz it's easy. But who wants like Do you
[2:25:43] guys like burgers?
[2:25:46] Wow.
[2:25:48] It's pretty much the majority, I think.
[2:25:50] Was that?
[2:25:53] So, I'm not going to I'm landing people
[2:25:57] in it, but I won't actually be there. I
[2:25:58] have to drive to Oakland Basically after
[2:26:00] this um because I got to be in
[2:26:02] Oakuckland early in the morning. But, um
[2:26:03] Hannah, stand up over there, Hannah. So,
[2:26:09] this is Hannah.
[2:26:11] And also, this is this is Jesse.
[2:26:16] So,
[2:26:18] and there'll be a few other people there
[2:26:21] and different ones are going to be
[2:26:22] helping out and things. So, they will
[2:26:24] Yeah. If you need anything when you're
[2:26:25] there, they will be they will look after
[2:26:27] you and it doesn't cost you anything.
[2:26:29] Okay? So, you don't have to pay for
[2:26:31] anything. Um,
[2:26:34] but I don't I don't just want to say,
[2:26:37] "Oh, yeah. Um, look how good I am."
[2:26:40] Like, I don't mean it like that. the way
[2:26:41] we do it here. But I've also learned in
[2:26:43] my Christian walk that you also it's a
[2:26:45] bit selfish to not give people
[2:26:46] opportunity as well, you know, cuz I
[2:26:49] think oh no, I'll keep you all the
[2:26:50] opportunity for me to you give to me and
[2:26:51] I'm this look how great I am, you know.
[2:26:53] So, so I'm Hannah doesn't know I'm going
[2:26:55] to do this. But like if you do want to
[2:26:57] give anything, you can just go and see
[2:26:58] Hannah. She can swipe it and do do
[2:26:59] whatever. So there's the two-way thing.
[2:27:01] If you want to, you can. If you don't
[2:27:02] want to, you don't have to. Like we
[2:27:04] there's a blessing either way. Don't
[2:27:05] matter which way it falls. There's a
[2:27:06] blessing. It doesn't. Okay? But there's
[2:27:08] no obligation, no nothing. Just turn up.
[2:27:09] It's a great time. We got about 100
[2:27:11] seats orund something. There's room for
[2:27:13] everyone there.
[2:27:16] [Laughter]
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; No, that wasn't a call for money. Okay.
[2:27:23] The Lord. But I just I've learned that
[2:27:26] in life, you know, you just you got just
[2:27:28] when you give it over to the Lord, he
[2:27:29] does what he wants to do.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; So So yeah, I don't I don't want to I
[2:27:32] don't want to rob We don't want to cuz
[2:27:34] brother used to say, "No, no, don't do
[2:27:36] But then he learned I'm robbing people
[2:27:37] of an opportunity that the Lord wanted
[2:27:39] to bless them and he wanted them to do
[2:27:40] it so he could bless them. So yeah, that
[2:27:45] um so there was a song that came on my
[2:27:47] mind. I thought, what's what's a closing
[2:27:49] song we could do to sort of encapsulate
[2:27:52] the the end of the service? And a little
[2:27:55] song came up. You might know this one.
[2:27:56] Can you bring this song up? Who knows
[2:27:58] this song? I thought it was quite
[2:27:59] fitting. I was like, "Oh, that song.
[2:28:01] It's not by might, not by power, by my
[2:28:03] spirit, sayeth the Lord." than the first
[2:28:05] two. This mountain shall be removed.
[2:28:09] So, wow, that fits. So, let's um so
[2:28:12] let's stand up and let's um just sing
[2:28:14] this song here. Who knows the song? A
[2:28:16] few people know it. Yeah. Oh, great.
[2:28:17] Okay, let's let's let's sing this song a
[2:28:19] time or two and then we'll just um
[2:28:20] dismiss in prayer.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; I think it's G. Well, here's a test.
[2:28:26] Young musicians never You didn't even
[2:28:27] know this song, did you? We're going to
[2:28:28] do it in front.
[2:28:35] We'll go a It's not by might, not by
[2:28:40] power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[2:28:45] Not by might, not by power, but by my
[2:28:49] spirit, saith the Lord.
[2:28:52] Oh, this mountain shall be removed.
[2:28:57] This mountain shall be removed.
[2:29:01] This mountain shall be removed
[2:29:05] by my spirit says
[2:29:09] not by might nor by
[2:29:13] my spirit saith the Lord. Not by might,
[2:29:16] not by might, not by how
[2:29:21] my spirit say the Lord. For this
[2:29:25] mountain shall be removed.
[2:29:28] This mountain shall be removed.
[2:29:32] This mountain shall be removed by my
[2:29:37] spirit. Listen one last time. Not by
[2:29:40] might, not by might. Not my power, but
[2:29:44] by my spirit, say the Lord.
[2:29:48] Not by might, not my power, but by my
[2:29:53] spirit, say the Lord. Oh yes. This
[2:29:56] mountain shall be removed.
[2:30:00] This mountain shall be removed.
