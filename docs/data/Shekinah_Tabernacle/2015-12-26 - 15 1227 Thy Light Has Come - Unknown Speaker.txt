um if you'd like to just take your Bibles um just so just one announcement to the wash night Services New Year's Eve so Thursday night I believe that is amen so yes and then also yeah um yeah and then maybe potentially next Sunday we might be having church at the chapel at El Rancho is that if possible we'll see but um okay yes I'll but we'll make sure everyone knows Before Time so that'll be next Sunday hey man let's go to uh Isaiah chapter 60. uh it's good to be home you know we drove home yesterday it's good to be home I mean I trust everyone had a Merry Christmas and um amen so it's wonderful you know I'm so glad he's not a baby in a Manger anymore you know I'm I'm thankful he was but I'm glad he's still you know he's not back there but I'm so glad we can live this side of Calvary you know this side of the atonement that we can rejoice in what he's done and and see it not just talk about it but experience that Saving Grace amen that he is shed abroad in our hearts you know it's so such a wonderful thing so let's go to Isaiah chapter 60 verses one and two and I just we'll just see how the Lord leads today so there's a scripture that that that is speaking of us it says arise and shine for thy lightest come and the glory the Lord has risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people for the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee amen we'll go to John chapter one and we'll just want to read the first first 18 verses here just bear with me but um it's incredible just to just to see how the scripture is not only historical but he is the same yesterday today and forever and you know we can just Rejoice that because we know him in this hour how do you know Jesus is real because he's alive today how do you know he died on Calvary because he's alive today how do you know that he was born in a manger because he's alive today and what he says he does in his word he does it today that's how we know he's alive you know sure there's the tomb sure there's gold things but he said we well they just built those things did they you know but I say just bypass all the evidence that people having to say he's alive today because we've experienced in my life that's how I know that Jesus is the Living God now so first so chapter one and we'll just read from verse one down to verse 18. and the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not uh there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came through a witness to be a witness of the light that all men through whom might believe he was not that light but he was sent to be a witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God thought even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John be a witness of him and cried saying this is he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was made so I thought he was before me and of his fullness have we have all we received and Grace for grace for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may be seated so uh I want to uh I want to speak about eternal life eternal life has come and you know I just want to read I'm going to read a few bits from from the message uh uh Shalom but we just read there in Isaiah chapter 60 is such a great contrast great Darkness covers some people but in the glory the Lord has risen upon some other people so I'd say it's a great contrast but we see that the world is in that condition we see gross Darkness covers this world but then at the same time our light has come the glory of the Lord has risen upon and elect people and so you know we understand that that light you know that is God himself is actually his glory himself his presence has has come upon some people even in this great day of Darkness you know to me we can spend we can spend a lifetime talking about how bad the world is insured is bad but we can we shouldn't look at the negative but we should look at the positive where we say that God has come and his fullness in this hour and he has revealed himself to a people that we don't have to be scared of the darkness but we can say greater that is in us that is in the world Amen then we have Supreme confidence that if our God has called us then he will take us in a Rapture that he will he will by his grace take us into the Eternal Realm and brother Branham sees us and the message Shalom he says the world is in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that it's ever stood in and yet it's standing again the Most Blessed light that is that it ever shine and there is the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and God separated the light from darkness and I believe that we are living in that hour again that when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest and he says and we are the church the reason I say shalom to them is because that it's God's peace that's what I want to bring to you this morning for the new year not looking back but we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there is something great laying ahead of us where the years has been the joy that we've been looking forward to the pressing coming of the great light and now we see it breaking over the horizontal realm but breaking he says but breaking between Mortal and immortality we see it breaking between heavens and earth from a sick Earthbound sickness in a troubled world and to a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal Earth that can never pass away that's why I say it's shalom unto the church peace God's peace be upon you okay he's saying that gross Darkness covers the people but the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee so he's saying because he because you know this was in this was in 64. you know into 64 he preached us the world was in great trouble you know there's a Soviet Union and all the different things going on you know and everyone was trouble what would happen but he's saying Shalom peace God's peace you know be upon you don't be troubled by these things and we can see the world was gearing itself for another War for another great conflict we can see it happening we can see it it's you know it's in the starting blocks and people are perplexed and worried about you know what's happening but to the elect ones I say shalom I say God's peace be upon you amen Don't Fear The Darkness don't fear how bad this world may be getting in the influences out there I say shalom hey man that we have we have God's peace amen we have the presence of God has come upon us not by our choosing but by his choosing I mean not by our own will but his will amen he knew you'd be born he knew you'd be alive in this hour and he wasn't he wasn't worried about how evil the world is he said I'm gonna I'm gonna gather my people and they're going to be my peace is going to be upon them I mean it doesn't matter how they feel or what they think about it they're gonna my peace is gonna come upon them and they're gonna yield to me I put something in them to yield to me yes yes Hallelujah yeah we're gonna just Rejoice we sang that song The Deep calling to the Deep if there's a deep in there you didn't put that there I may probably say this every Sunday but I'll just keep saying it if there's a deep in there you didn't put that in there and people say well I've never had a pull towards God but yet they go into the world and they tried drugs and they try women and they try drink and they try Sport and they try business and they try all these different things they're trying to satisfy that deep all these natural things and they say well God's never called me God is calling but people always go to a natural answer when there's only one answer which is Jesus Christ but remember he put that he put that in you and you can't buy it you can't earn it you can't learn it it's there before you're born it's there Hallelujah so now I just I just skip down I want to read this I was so blessed when I read this quote here this is in God's covenant with Abraham and if I jump around I jump around he says yes sir that's he now he was the one back there in the bosom of the Father the logos that went out of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us and he was with Abraham he was the god of Abraham so remember there's the Sons and Daughters of Abraham are alive upon the Earth by faith amen the faith generation are the are thee they have the same Faith Abraham had so they had the same faith that would take them from where they are born into a new land yes and they would be taken to a place where they where God says this all belongs to you and not only that but Abraham was promised a promised son amen and his own flesh couldn't couldn't bring it forth you know Romans Romans I believe chapter four maybe let's just read a little bit um and then I'll come back to I'll come back to this quote but you know he speaks in this you hear Brother Brown say I met God's requirements I've met God's requirements and if we're not careful we will we will make it make that a hamster wheel and we'll say and we'll try and meet God's requirements what does that mean I've met God's requirements and so he and he answers the question in the Square it's beautiful because he about I just want to read this verse because Abraham we have the faith of Abraham the believer has the faith of Abraham and we read this here we'll go down to uh you know Romans 4. and then we'll go down to let's just read from verse 13 we'll go down we'll just read it but let's just read this for the promise that he should be ear of the world was not to Abraham or a seed but through the law that through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be is Faith is made void and the promise made of no effect because the law worketh wrath for where there are no laws there is no transgression therefore it is of faith and that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed not only sorry not to only which is of the law but to that which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all for it is written I have made thee father of many nations before him whom he believed even God whom quickened the dead and calleth all things which are not as though they were who against hope believed in hope now there's hope in the Bible is not like I hope I win the lotto it's a it's an Earnest expectation that God is going to do it that is Bible hope so it's not a hope so it's actually I'm under expectation to see it fulfilled so who against hope Believers and hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was yet a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong and faith-giving glory to God and being fully persuaded uh that what he had promised he was also able to perform and therefore it was imputed unto him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification so Abraham hey yo it wasn't just Sarah's womb that was dead Abraham's body was dead as well he couldn't bring forth the promise in his own you know it wasn't that he was fertile and she was sterile but they were both in that condition and even when they were nearly 100 years old we understand they went down into Korea that you know they went into Egypt and the kings of those countries because two occasions he does it the kings of those countries wanted to marry Sarah and they were old so they weren't they weren't physically when they went down there they weren't old grandma grandpa because why would the king of a place who could have every woman he wants says I want to marry Grandma she's beautiful she was that age but she had been turned young again and that's why that's why she you know that's why the Kings wanted to marry her but we see we are we are much the same way God God makes us new again but we understand that it is not Abraham and himself could not bring forth the promise of God and he tried one time with with Hagar brought forth an Ishmael brought forth a wild man so even man's good intentions cannot bring forth the promise of God it takes God and his season to bring forth the promise and so now but he was fully persuaded that God was able to perform that which he had promised but we understand that Abraham had his own failures you know he there's one time where where where he actually laughs in the presence of God saying how can this be hex he rolls on the ground when God says I'm going to make you the father of many nations you're going to have the son and he's just rolling in the ground and the prince of God laughing at God how can this be so so you could say well he staggered sometimes he sure did but but he was looking when when Paul was writing the Divine commentary of his life he doesn't see those failings he doesn't see those failings Because deep down in Abraham was God is able to do it I don't know how he's going to do it I don't know when he's going to do it but God is able to do it and that is the same faith that that the Seed of Abraham according to Faith have is they may fail they may stumble and I'm not condoning sin but you know we still live in these bodies amen and we fail every day sure we do but there's something in them saying God's able to change this body God's able to take me into Glory God's able to change these atoms and we're looking for a Rapture in this time are we not so and just like Abraham and Sarah their bodies were changed and they had the promised son Hallelujah that's why we have that's why that's why we are we are the same the same walk Abraham had we have because he was looking for a promised son to come he was looking for a body change and and he received both those things so he was the god of Abraham no he was with Abraham he was the god of Abraham he is with you and he is your god if he goes with Abraham he's sure with you amen he was the one that was in the bush with Moses and so forth now notice when God called Abraham he called for a total separation separate yourself from your Kinsmen separate from your father's house separate from all your Associates and be and completely annihilate yourself from all these things and walk with me what a privilege it is when a man is being called like that how happy a real Christian is to separate himself amen separate yourself he says Abraham besides all this not if you will I am I have already settled it remember the Covenant he made with Abraham was not if you're good enough and if you do this then you have the promise son he says I have made you father of many nations I have already done it and he's a man he physically cannot even have a child but God has said I have made you the father of Nations amen and then God comes Upon Our scene however many thousand years ago you know I mean down the road and he speaks to you and and he begins to draw you the same light you know the light has come apart remember I'm talking about God's eternal life coming yeah you know the glory of the Lord Rising upon you and then he comes to you and he and he begins to draw you to himself and you begin to see the the the inability you have amen and and you begin to recognize I cannot you know because you hear such a high calling the bride of Christ to become one with the very king of glory the greatest one there's ever been and he wants to be United with a people who are born and sinned shaped at iniquity come to the world speaking wise who are failures to begin with were born with a fallen sin nature amen he he doesn't even look at that he doesn't look at your first birth he doesn't look at you know this guy because in in you he's he's placed the one he's looking forward in you the real you and then you and you feel the prince of God and you you just you know and then you feel how could I how could I ever do this amen but yet something in you says he's able to do it how could he save a rich like me but he's able to do it how can he set me free from the bondage of sin and spirits and all these different things but he's able to do it hey man I did so because remember the same one is with him is with us he was called you know Abraham and his family especially his dad they came out of Babel Tara Babble is just leaving God you know of course there are languages to change and then they they came out of great Darkness as well it was a great time of Darkness here with Babel and everything you know Tower of Babel so they were called in a time of great Darkness but yet he was but he was he was willing to respond to the call and then he was with God and God walked with him he says now so so I have already settled it I'm gonna make a covenant with you now Abraham and I'm going to make you an heir to the world and to all the nations you'll be the father of every nation I'm going to make a covenant with you and your seed you're coming to me in an old age no doubt about it and you're going to do a great work for me and besides I'm going to give you a child by Sarah your wife and through him all nations shall be blessed it says oh I just get to talking about that I just feel something moving the holy spirit says I will not if you will but I will then if the Covenant he made with man in the Garden of Eden without any strings attached to it he would send a savior God's obligated to do it and he did it and if that Covenant was perfectly fulfilled so will so will the Covenant God gave Abraham and his seed unconditionally be fulfilled as certain as Jesus came to the Earth to fulfill what God had said do it's got to be so what are we worried about there's no need the Christian people seem to be back in a corner say oh I'm afraid what are you afraid about why you ought to be the most freest people in the world amen well brother Branham when I get in the Millennium I ain't waiting for the Millennium I am right now we are now the Sons and Daughters of God we're sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when right now what you say how how what do you mean that sounds so abstract no the believer you just see how why are we different I'm not talking about just here all around the world why why are real Christians different why do they think differently why do they look at the same world that everyone else looks at it and see it differently it's not because they're programmed and forced through some seven steps to whatever to be different but God has caused him to walk in a different Realm I mean their thinking is different their mind is yeah they're very high desire is different amen you can't help being different you can't you know because you can take your own countrymen someone who's maybe born same day who lived next door to you you know you know went to the same school has the same job you could have someone who's exactly the same like that but yet God has called you and something in you is is different amen why is that because you're sitting in a different place yeah yeah you're actually seated in Heavenly places amen and you can't help Abraham could not help being what he was you know brother bam says there's nothing special about Abraham but God called him and that made the difference there's nothing special about you and I but God called us and that's what makes it we're no better than the person on the street but God called us amen thank you that's why I believe we shouldn't ever look down on anyone because we're just like them but God called us in in reality we should make we should feel lower than them Jesus came not to be ministered to but to minister and the minister is a servant amen he placed the rest of the world above himself now we're seeing together in Heavenly places right now present tense every man or woman or boy or girl that's been born again of God and receive the holy spirit is now sitting in Heavenly places win as many as two or three gathered Christ promise to be in the midst amen now some people goes by feeling I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved the devil can beat you around the stump every day on that but I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved because I met God's requirements now what okay I'm saved because I met God's requirements God called me and I accepted it and by faith I believe it so he's actually saying this is what God's requirements are God called me I accepted him by faith I believe it that's what he's saying God's requirements are amen I'm saved because I meet God's requirements you say that's way too simple no it's not God called me I I accepted him by faith I believe it and therefore I've met God's requirements yes yes amen oh it can't be that simple yeah it is God remember no man can come to the father unless I draw him amen no man can come to me so unless the father draws him first so it's not man making a decision for the Lord but God has to draw God has to draw the people amen and that's how you know you've met God's requirements because he's drawn me amen and I've accepted it and by faith I believe it Hallelujah I was just so happy when I read that because people say yo you gotta you gotta oh bang the full word of God and and I'll come to it because we live in an hour where God is making a difference between the believer in the world he is making a difference and maybe maybe let's just let's just go to that so let's just go to Exodus I want to read this now because this is we're living in an hour if we go to Exodus and then we're in verse 11. Exodus Exodus at chapter 11. and then we'll read verse 7. read verses six and seven because Egypt was in a time of Darkness once we're after the plagues the second the last plague was Darkness Came Upon Egypt gross Darkness covered the people and God was saying in that season he says this year says and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as the as there was none like it nor shall there nor shall it be like it anymore but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how the law doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel and this is just before if you read the whole chapter God is saying he's going to Smite the firstborn and so so God has actually come down and he's saying I'm going to make a difference between the children of between the Egyptians and the children of Israel I'm gonna I'm gonna make a demarcation now Now's the Time where there's going to be a separation and it's not and God is going to put a difference between them and this is just before the death angel comes into the land this is where we are in the plagues and so he's saying that that and darkness had already fallen over over Egypt and so God is saying I'm going to make a difference and that difference you know we won't read it but if you want to read it later you read you know Exodus chapter 12 and that's when that's when the Passover is first is first done and they had to have a lamb and they had to kill a lamb for a house and they had to put the blood of that Lamb on the door and lintel of the house that when the death angel comes through to kill the firstborn when when he sees the blood he'll pass over you so it wasn't because it wasn't because they were Israelites that the blood I mean the death angel would not pass over them they could say look we're circumcised believers but now is the time for the blood to be applied Now's the Time for a life to be given Now's the Time for a life to be given for a life amen just like Jesus came amen he's our Passover Lamb he's our perfect lamb and then said God now he said at this day now there's going to be a difference between you and the Egyptians and honestly this is just me but I feel if the Egyptians kill the lamb and they followed What Moses said the death angel would have passed over their house too because because it doesn't say when he sees you're an Israelite that he'll pass over he says when I see the blood then I'll pass over you and so now 's a great time of darkness and God made a preparation that when the death angel strikes then it won't affect those who are under the blood but we understand that you know our lord Jesus you know he he is our lamb and he shed his blood on Calvary for you you know we didn't provide our own lamb God provided his own lamb God provided a perfect sacrifice God provided what was needed that we could pass from Death unto life God provided a life that that would that that would die in our place because man man cannot try you know man and his good intentions has created religion man you know and and you go from any any part of the globe man there's because there's something in man to worship God there's something in him doesn't matter if you're in Africa or Papua New Guinea or or America or East Asia wherever it may be you know there's always been something in man to say there's more than life there's more to life than this and man tries to reform himself to try and become more holy and more you know more like God whatever God they believe in but we're we're we're born with a fallen nature to begin with and that's why there's war that's why there's greed and bloodshed and all these things upon the Earth and famine and death you know this world this world if man was not greedy this world could there would be no starvation you know if man wasn't greedy and wanted the dollar there'll be no starving you know people wouldn't be dying with AIDS as they do these epidemics because you see the pharmaceutical companies they have the drugs they have the ability to make the drugs but they hold it back for game they sure do they could put their stuff out like no tomorrow and they don't make any money out of that what is agreed why are millions die needlessly greed of man who put that greed in that they were born with that Fallen nature you see and so if they if that greed was taken out of the way there'd be no famine there'd be no people dying needlessly but man has a fallen nature and they try and reform themselves and do a little bit better you know try and be more moral in these things they want to try and evolve themselves into something greater but no man can do that in a lone strength amen and their sincerity in man's deep sincerity man cannot lift themselves up into any greater State than what they're born in that's why God had to come himself amen and he had to place his hand upon us and change our nature from from unbelief to Faith I mean take that sin nature out of us and the only way he could do that was by the power of the blood I'm in that life that was released at down Calvary comes upon you turns your heart to him and then you're different then you're a new creature in Christ amen amen then it's not him are you trying to reform yourself but now his nature comes into you and now he begins to take control of you hallelujah amen and so he had to come Jesus had to come but we understand now the blood was shed in Calvary and we must believe in that blood but it was the life that was released that day when he died his Spirit came out of him the blood cell was broken his life was released because in animal life doesn't have a soul and so in the Old Testament when they gave a lamb or they gave a bullock or whatever it was a life was given but the nature and the lamb could not come back upon the believer and change him no matter how sincere they were when they did it it couldn't change them because animal life is different to human life because they don't have a soul we have a soul and so so but a life was still given but it couldn't change the person that's why you read the Old Testament there's as soon as the law was given on Mount Sinai there was the blood of bulls and goats and sheep were shared by the multitudes you know all the time peace offerings and sin offerings given all the time because in their sincerity you know they could not change themselves you know someone who came you know they sinned the sin that wasn't to death and and they came and gave the lamb they they offered the lamb but then when they left they still had the same desire in them they couldn't actually change what was in them that actually caused them to bring the offering in the first place and then so but then when Jesus came that blood that was shared that day there was a life that was released just like when the lamb or the Bullock died and that same life but that same life was different because it wasn't just a man dying that was God yeah Emmanuel God With Us the word Jesus became flesh and so it was the blood of God that was shared on Calvary and so that blood was hit and a life was released and then now that life came into the apostles in the upper room and what happened was now God was beginning to make a difference I'm going to show because remember when Jesus was born this was eternal life coming back into the human race this wasn't just a baby in a Manger this was eternal life was made flesh the life that was in the bosom of the father was now declared and so God was God was revealing himself in that way because it was eternal life yeah I was thinking about this last I was pondering it was eternal life as a baby here was eternal life as a young boy in the temple talking about himself in the word he was a he was a he was eternal life as a man age 30 coming down to the river Jordan how was eternal life now going into his ministry after being baptized yeah this is this is God and flesh it wasn't just a man this was the god man and he was he was eternal life Healing The Sick here was eternal life raising the dead it was eternal life setting the captives free you know came down to where you know Legion was thousand devils in him you know he lost the captive here was eternal life speaking saying the words I speak to you thou spirit and their life has eternal life speaking his eternal life breaking you're multiplying the bread and the fish's Creed you're creating eternal life was doing these things and here he was he was eternal life the light of men had come and he came out of the very bosom of the father now the bosom you know if you read you know that's where the heart is and and the definition of that word it has it has a few meanings but it's the space between a person's clothing and their chest where that is used to carry things so he carried a letter in his bosom he put it he put it over his heart it is it is also a place a person's loving care and protection and it can also refer to the seat of emotions how someone feels so you know it can refer to you know for example and it's also synonymous with the soul the being the inner being the very core of someone so now God when when Jesus was born here was he came out of the bosom of the father so this was revealing this is who really who I am this is this is the heart of God is expressed in a baby in a Manger so this is this is eternal life being you know it wasn't just you know Jesus you know I was I was very touched by this because this is a very hard this is God you know he couldn't reveal himself like he wanted to on Mount Sinai and then here it comes as a baby this is me this is my very heart yo you know you meet some people and and you keep it very surface level how are you how's work you know and then and then people you know but better you maybe go a bit deeper and then finally people you really know and you speak them well then you begin to share what's on your heart you begin to real really what you're carrying on your bosom amen and so now God God may be in the Old Testament he has more surface level not that you're probably not the best way to put it but God was on Mount Sinai and the people at the bottom and they couldn't come up into the prince of God and all these things and so but then now now he's going to reveal his heart this is this is really who I am this is really this is I'm the fullness of Grace and Truth I've come to redeem those which were lost I've come to find my household my children amen I've come to find my bride hey man you could yeah he's really revealing really yo his core being as a baby in a Manger that's incredible because you know the scribes and Pharisees they wanted a general they wanted some military genius or some politician But Here Come God gives them what they need as a baby in a Manger Hallelujah amensanel but now through this he's saying I'm going to make a difference because he wanted to identify himself with his people and not just to be next to them he wanted to be in them and so he wanted and that's why he he died on Calvary because there had to be blood given that God could dwell in people again and so he gave us life that that very life that was released on Calvary could come into a people and then that life coming on the day of Pentecost unto the people God began to make a difference because now eternal life wasn't just walking in one person eternal life was in 120 people and then it as the word was preached thousands more came in and then eternal life came into them Hallelujah and God was identifying himself with a bunch of houses a bunch of people and say no I'm going to put a mark on these people that when the death angel comes amen I'll pass over them Hallelujah it doesn't matter where they're born or what they're from or what they did amen as long as the life was there amen how do you know Jesus died for you because the life comes in yes amen Hallelujah now yo yo he says in Greater Mighty conqueror he says he says because he was in the beginning the Bible said he was the word he was the logos that went out of God and the logos in the beginning was the word and he and he became the word then when he ascended up on that glorious day of Easter he became not only the word but he became the high priest of his own word oh what a glorious thing brother Neville just think he's not only the word but he's the high priest of his own word what does that mean you confess what he said and then his obligated to perform what he what he said he would do that's what that means how could we doubt it how could we walk to him and not believe that we receive what we asked for for he is the word and the intercessors word the logos became word and the word became flesh in the same flesh that was the word was received up into glory and now the high priest making intercession by himself to his word that's what it takes that's the material that the word has got what a weapon there's never been one like it he was the word and when he come he was born in a manger he come to use the weapon of l-o-v-e love to conquer the world not with army bullets not with machine guns and tanks but he come in a different manner he'd come he come in the form of love he was God's love he said one time as a little boy I used to think that Christ loved me and God hated me because that Christ died for me but God had something against me but I come to find out that Christ is the very heart of God hallelujah God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but would have eternal life Hallelujah now so he said he'd make a difference now I just wanna and that's why God in this Darkness hour he's making a difference because that same life that was given on the day of Pentecost is in The Believer today Amen brother Brown said that that life was once caught in the doors you know stuck at the doors of of denomination of creed and Dogma it was actually held back from the people they said it's been released by this end time message the Holy Ghost is released by this entire message to the people why because the truth of God's word will give you access to the to the Holy Ghost I mean so because if you believe a lie you won't get what you think you should get but if you believe the truth you'll receive the results of the truth Hallelujah that's why you know we find out that this is why God is making a difference between the church the believer in the world amen that even in this dark hour if you have the life of God in you and that's what God requires he requires that token not just it's not blood chemistry anymore because you can't get the blood chemistry back it was on Calvary the rest of life that was in that blood comes into you and that's why I posed the question before how do you know God died for young how do you know Jesus died for you on Calvary because the life that was in him comes into you that's how you how do you know your sins are forgiven because a life that was in him comes into you yes well then how do you and you say well then people were going to go down the road has my experience been big enough no you're gonna you gotta I was talking to a young brother up in you know up in Tauranga brother Bram was speaking to a sister called sister Bruce I'm sure you've read or listened to if you haven't go read it's either called interviewer sister Bruce or private interview and in 1964 and there's a sister who who's a Believer and she has a private interview with the prophet and she's asking when she wants to know that God would show him a vision of when did I receive the Holy Ghost because she feels like she's just a failure and there's no way she could you know she wants to know and then he very much simply says one day your life was going this way but now your heart all your heart is I want to serve the Lord and he asked her what did it and she said Christ you can hear it on the recording and he says there it is amen so you've got to look at you know you've got to look at your life and you have to now remember if you really believe you know if we love him we keep his Commandments because his God his commandment's not Grievous to us but you see you gotta strip down everything in your life and even when you don't feel like serving God and even when you don't feel like coming to church and even being a Believer you're going to come down to the very core of you and think has my heart turned that deep down even if I'm tired and wore out and however the devil's warring against you deep down you want to serve him because you love him above all things I can say according to that that that's Christ that did that amen that's Crossing to that because people can have great even great Supernatural testimonies but yet end up in the world someplace I believe in the Supernatural absolutely but you see so you have to go you haven't got to take those layers away and come down to the very core of it yes yes there's my heart deep down is the real me I want to serve him because I love him in spite of my failures in spite of my weaknesses something is being turned with a life I once lived there's nothing in me that wants it anymore not because I've shared a bunch of rules or this is this is the church manual we don't have a church manual this is the church manual amen that we live this way because we love him there's not a bunch of thou shall thou shall not it's never been that way so you've got to look down the very yo go go read that when you say something is actually turned in your life that you want to serve him in spite of you know whatever goes on deep down it's like Peter Peter saw a great Shining Light in his day Jesus there yes he's but he failed he failed so many times and yet after the resurrection you know yeah you know they're fishing Peter just says basically I'm going to go back to my old life he says I'm just gonna go fishing and they're fishing they didn't catch anything all night Jesus appears on the on the sea Bank children have you caught any meat and he says and then one of them says no you know I haven't caught anything it says put your net on the other side of the boat and probably no doubt they thought well we tried that but they tried it anyway and then it was full of fish and then John that says the apostle that loved the Lord or was loved of him he whispers to Peter that's the Lord and then he throws on his fishing coat and he swims yo yo yo swims to the bank and they're there and they're having a meal and Jesus asked Peter Peter do you love me yes Lord feed my Lambs Peter you love me yes Lord he says feed my sheep Peter do you love me and Peter says Lord you know I love you you see this was the and the Lord knew that Peter loved him and so I could go down to the very core of himself remember he cursed he tried to kill the you know guy in the garden with the sword with no take try and take Jesus away all these different things he did but a boiled down to Peter said Lord you know you love me you know all things he says feed my sheep amen so look at what Jesus was looking at amen you understand yeah amen has your heart have you been turned from unbelief to Faith because if you've done that you have to surrender everything you've got to surrender every part of yourself I mean now you gotta read that he says your life brother man speaking of that well now you have to have the own witness in yourself that you know the Lord amen but sometimes we we we're chasing something that's not even what God is looking for amen yeah yeah no I don't believe in easy believism there'll be a life that's following these signs shall follow a Believer Amen in God's time and God will do those things but people will see a difference in you amen people sure see a difference in you and that's because that life has come in I mean you're a new creature in Christ amen so now so that life we must have that token on display which is the life of God in us now he says in the token of Baker's field and maybe we'll just I'll see how we go he says this is now realizing these things now he's talking about Darkness upon the world as well but just just listen what I'm saying and we realize these things and woman dressing and acting and doing and Men permitting them to do it big bunch of sissies it seems like there's not even men anymore you see men wearing pink shoes and preachers in the Pulpit something like that that's a disgrace I like to see men again that's absolutely men looks like there's a power drives them to do it uh it's the devil and the pressures of this day that's right sometime a man weighing 200 pounds and muscles like that are not an ounce of man in them acts like some big out there let men be men let let women be feminist let them be ladies he says when the tokens applied they turn back to that amen so he says when the life comes in they turn back to what they're meant to be amen that's what I'm saying you can see a difference in someone because when the token when that life comes in it actually makes them what they're you know what they ought to be God made them different and they are different man wants to look like woman and woman wants to look like men goes to show there's a perversion a dark Spirit hanging over gross Darkness over the people it's the hour of the calling out there's a Darkness over Egypt before the call before the calling out when the token was applied it's time for the church to get the token or gross darknesses upon the people he says gross Darkness yes so you say you say that's pretty strong words people you know it's a bunch of perversion but this world has changed it doesn't take you don't have to go back that many years to see the world is rapidly changed to what it once was what's causing that what's influencing the people to do that Darkness has come upon the face of the people but in that hour of Darkness thy light has come the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee and notice it says thy lighters come you know when I when two people make a contract uh especially well this is in the Bible days they would write the contract down and they'd rip the contract in half and then during their signing time they would actually kill an animal and they would say if we break our half of the bargain let us be like this dead animal amen so God was showing that at Calvary because he knew because remember this this this walk this Covenant we have with God is not if thou will it's I already have I already have so he became that slain animal on Calvary because he knew that you couldn't keep up your side of the bargain if it was conditional yes yes amen so he knew that he had to become the offering because he knew that you couldn't keep your side of the bargain and so now when those two people come back together you could say just like if I had it and you had the other piece I'd say you have my part you have your part of my contract I mean it was personal you understand so when thy light has come is because you are part of God's contract you're part of God's covenant are you following me yes I mean that he says when thy light has come the glory of the Lord has come upon you is because that is part because you're part of Adam's Fallen race amen and God made a promise from the Garden of Eden I'm going to undo all this damage that that Satan has done this day and so he's looking for people that are part of that Redemption I mean he's looking for people that are part of that redeeming you see so when the Lord comes upon you when this word becomes real to you and it quickens amen you can say my light has come because you didn't know as I see in the very beginning there's a deep calling to the Deep amen so there's so there's a contract that that you have to become part of and God has one half of it and you were actually the other half and there's a longing because because your life is never satisfied until the two come together amen I trust this this makes sense but you see so when that deep calls to the Deep and the and your light comes when the spirit of God comes upon you that's actually the other half of the contract coming into being I'm in joining you both together yes Hallelujah amen now I just want to go back and read this here this is back in God's covenant with Abraham and forgive me for jumping around but this is where I just feel to go he says now I'm saved because I met God's requirements God called me I accepted it and by faith I believe it whether I feel good whether I feel like it or not I am anyhow because God said so he says accepting your healing lady it ain't how you feel it's what you believe Jesus never did say did you feel it he said Do you believe it amen based solemnly upon the finished works of Christ at Calvary every Redemptive blessing belongs to the believer when you become a Christian God gives you a checkbook in there with Jesus name signed at the bottom of it for anything you've got need of while you're in life's journey are you afraid to cash in amen fill it out send it at the headquarters and see what God will do about it amen well if I'd known there was deposit enough his blood is sufficient for what he was wounded for our transgressions Bruce for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with the stripes we are healed we were healed it's already deposited at Calvary and sickness is an attribute of sin and when you touch sin you get a touch sickness amen the same word saved is translated both ways you get saved from sin you get saved from sickness hey man so now we have met God's requirement that's what you know he says in this Christians are backed into a corner I'm afraid don't be afraid Shalom peace God's peace is upon you amen if you've come under the anointing of this word God's peace is upon you Hallelujah sometimes we take it for granted you're you're the atmosphere we live in and what God does for us we take it for granted yes yes don't take it for granted Amen in those days in Egypt the darkness wasn't in Goshen amen the plagues never struck Goshen amen and so they can actually physically see the light in the Darkness but it's not a literal it's not a literal death that's coming it's a spiritual death amen it's spiritual Darkness that's upon the people you see so we have to look at it through spiritual eyes where something is has happened that this becomes a love letter amen I was so happy just you know you know driving home yesterday just so happy in my you know my salvation I was just crying in my heart just so so rejoicing our light has come I mean we're not looking for a Breaking of the day it is breaking we're not look you know you know even It's always darkest before Dawn amen It's always darkest because the light of the sun is coming over the horizon you're about to break the Horizon and and it actually pushes the darkness you know you've seen it you know if you've ever been up in the dawn you know just before Dawn It's always darkest before Dawn and it is the darkest spiritually this world is the darkest it's ever been yes why because it's a Breaking of a new day where a millennium is coming in to be Hallelujah and we are beneficiaries of that sun rising amen amen where we're not in darkness God has made a difference God has made a difference between the believer and the unbeliever amen and it's not the Believers choosing it's God's choosing because Israel he wanted to protect because he wanted to deliver them from from the Egyptians so what's God's doing all of that it was God's doing so so he gave the blood because he wanted to protect his children you know in one place he speaks of Israel coming out of Egypt he's out of Egypt have I called my son amen so he wanted to protect his children and that's why he gave the blood you know he didn't want them to their firstborn to die like the Egyptians he won he won he wanted to make the difference amen and here we are and we stumble into this world and we think this is where we're from and this is what we're gonna do and then one day God's voice falls into our ears and Faith Rises Hallelujah and our light actually has come amen and God does that because he wants to protect us from the darkness he wants to separate us from the darkness Hallelujah that we can be walking in this world but we can be not of this world Hallelujah Glory amen now maybe if the musician um could come please but you know we're living in a time of great Darkness but don't be afraid the life eternal life that was in the beginning with with with God himself has become manifest unto men amen and we already have that eternal life in us if you really know him you have that eternal life in you amen yes and we don't have to worry about how dark the world is sure we shouldn't be ignorant to the devil's devices but do not be afraid of it do not be afraid of it don't be afraid that your children you know right you know and maybe this will be later on but teach a child raise a child in the way it shall go and when it's old it shall not depart from it so don't just don't just bring them to church on a Sunday or a Thursday or you know Bible story or Wednesday here whatever but raise them in the way that they should go amen that is more than coming to church but it's spending time together praying talking about the Lord just show them how great God loves us you know if they're young like like our daughters they try and instill in them we love the Lord and this is why we live this way because we love him and look at this beautiful day we have God gave us this beautiful day isn't he wonderful to us and God gave us the rain because the earth needs to rain how good he is to how wonderful this food is and how you know because God gave us these things to enjoy and you begin to put in them we love the Lord how wonderful he is to us you know we know the lord it's so wonderful I I fell and hurt myself I'll pray for you you know can I pray for you I'm not feeling well can I pray for you it's all better you make it you know make make Christianity everyday living every day you know it's not yo yo with children it's not about pouring Doctrine into them you just put a great thankfulness this is God's word he has revealed himself in this end time yes amen God has sent us a prophet like unto Moses I mean to that we could really know Jesus in this day amen raise them in that way and when they're old they will not depart from it show the house struggles they'll have all these things remember there was a token applied they are in Egypt there was a blood applied to the house this day it's life there was the token is the life of God himself amen and it's not just in your heart it should be in your home amen that we love the Lord he is so wonderful he died on Calvary for us I mean we were lost now we're found amen he understands us because he lived like we did amen we you know and always always be a buddy to your you know to your children amen that they can come to you because if you can instill that in them they'll always go to God amen raise them in the way they shall go because we have a response we have a promise that will not leave one hoof behind but that promise has to be lived out because Darkness covers the people but our lighters come why aren't we like that Daddy you know they may they just may not know the Lord like we do amen that they're just like us amen Jesus died for everyone amen but we love the Lord this is why we're this way Hallelujah amen praise the Lord hey man let's let's stand shall we I mean our lighters come I mean what are we just saying that Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so you glad this morning don't be afraid of the devil don't be afraid of this world do not become some Monk on a Hilltop don't be afraid you haven't you say I don't feel like he's with me he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake me that's what he said take it up with him amen I will never leave you nor forsake you man have what you need yes I'm not seeing the answer Abraham just rejoiced every year he just rejoiced and then when it when it was God's timing and God's choosing that's when he had the son Hallelujah member have you met yeah you just got to ask yourself have I met God's requirement he didn't say if you have lived a perfect life and you've lived God's requirement he says I make God's requirement because he called me and I accepted it and I believed it that is God's requirement amen so if you've met God's requirement you don't have to fear anything just walk with him whatever comes whatever goes amen let's just sing this shall we I mean
