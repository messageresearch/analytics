amen praise the Lord let's go to Ezekiel chapter 28 I'm going to continue um we're going to continue on from last uh Sunday yes sorry yep so Ezekiel 28 and 12 who's going to read these uh two portions uh here and then in Isaiah then we're going to go to First Peter five we're going to talk about humility today and you know uh our brother bear makes a statement and we'll come to it that a man fully surrendous a God is omnipotent all-powerful amen so there's power and humility amen we're not just about you know humility is not uh wearing uh old clothes driving a old car and living in an old house humility is uh for obeying the word of God yes you're humbling yourself to the word of God that's true humility amen so I believe I'm looking at a bunch of humble people today who love the Lord amen so amen Ezekiel uh 28 and 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus saith the Lord God thou sealeth up the sum full of wisdom and perfect and Beauty thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was like covering the Sardis the topaz and the diamond the barrel the onks The Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship provide tablets and of thy pipes was repaired in the in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that covereth I have set thee so thou thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect and they ways from the days thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence thou has sinned therefore I will cast thee cast thee as a profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy the old covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty that was thou has corrupted thy wisdom because by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee amen that's you and I this morning we behold the devil for who he is amen and then um Isaiah 14 and 12 amen just going to read here how Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how Thou Art cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I'll Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation and the sides of the north I'll Ascend above the heights of the clouds I'll be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms amen let's just bowheads in the word of prayer I mean you'll be remembered and prayed you want to raise a hand to the Lord this morning amen gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful we can truly say Lord your name is power your name is healing and your name is life oh God we're so thankful we can say break every stronghold oh God burn Through the Fire Lord Jesus burn through the darkness oh God we're so glad that we can come before you this morning and lay our lives our hearts all that we are upon your altar oh God and say make us more like you consumer so God father have your way in this service this morning dear God as we have read your word we just Lord we want to invite you the Great Divine author of your word to come and speak to our hearts oh God speak to my heart change my heart too Lord Jesus don't leave me out of the picture oh God may have your way in our lives Lord we especially want to remember Lord sister Maggio God and Hospital father we thank you that she's moved out of ICU but father Lord we just want to pray you touch your body Lord Jesus we're so thankful father that no sickness or disease can hide from your eyes oh God lord you see through everything Lord Jesus Lord we thank you for all the doctors can do but you're the Great position Lord so I pray you would be the doctor by her bedside may you be the nurse Lord Jesus and father may you be the medicine oh God that flows through her veins into her body and may you restore every cell that's gone Lord that's out of order that's in chaos Lord bring full restoration to her health Lord Jesus and we pray father Lord for the baby too Lord Jesus May the baby be growing healthy strong and well father we thank you so much Lord for your healing hand Lord that by your stripes he's healed we're believing for it Lord and father May there be such an atmosphere in that hospital room Lord many other people have come through that room oh God many spirits but Lord now a daughter of yours is in that room father so we're asking that you are a great presence would fill that room Lord may it be a sanctuary for you to dwell Lord grant it father in Jesus Christ name of May touch anyone else Lord whose sick Lord among us know this cold sore we think of Giovanni Lord who's unwell father because of a flu may he touch him and take the life out of that virus as well and restore his health father For Your Glory we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless your friends you may have your seats this morning so as I'm saying I want to talk about humility I think it's very important we um we we remember what the Lord spoke to us uh on Sunday and so Kristen and I went through the transcript to went back and forth to get what was said and the Lord said thus saith the Lords this is last Sunday who was here on Sunday who remembers this right so I think we should revisit this because we don't just want to let it go and say that was amazing and forget about it right so she says thus saith the Lord my word came forth in this place when you began if you keep humble before me my word will continue to come it will find souls and they'll find rest what a commission that we have amen that is why I have called you today uh to Humble thyself again before me there are souls that need my rest they you must be humble you must be humble before me and they shall find their rest I have not left amen so we want to keep this very much I think burned in our hearts they're Souls that need the rest of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and I believe even in this room right now there's Souls here that I'm speaking to that need rest amen but it's not just enough just to come to church be part of a gathering we must know him in the power of his resurrection but you see the devil is the opposite of of humility he is proud he was lifted up we as we read there that is uh thy uh his heart was lifted up because of his Beauty and it's amazing how someone can be lifted up above what God has made them to be but we see that Satan you know he is the anointed cherub that covereth he was the actually controlled access to God to the other angels and you know but he got lifted up above what God made him instead of walking humility saying thank you Lord you've made me thus because really we should be satisfied with whatever part of the body we're of you know it doesn't matter if we're you know if I never preach another sermon in my life I still love the Lord you know I'm not a Christian because I'm a preacher or a pastor that's got nothing to do with it I'm a Christian because he found me redeemy buys blood-saving by his grace amen I just love him all the days of my life because he's been so good to me amen so I bet you see Satan got lifted up you know he was lifted up because of his Beauty and all these things and then his own because of that his own wisdom corrupted him where where he left his first estate he caused all the angels to fall amen and then now we find that this pride is not just stuck in a devil but it comes into human beings and it's the biggest problem upon the Earth is pride amen the reason why America is doing what it's doing is because of Pride I mean the reason China's doing what it's doing is because of Pride it's the reason that you know the whole nations are doing what they're doing fighting scrapping letting Devils control them is because of Pride but if we can humble ourselves before the hand of almighty God Amen we can let the Lord take control of Our Lives see it's amazing when you look at you know it says in First Peter 5 here likewise you're younger submit yourselves into the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility that means that humility should be your garment amen shouldn't be Pride or arrogance your self-sufficiency or you know we're not here to play games right we're not here to play political games with one another manipulate with emotions different things no we're here to serve the Lord amen so we've got to be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble now if you think about your grace we know in the Bible in New Testament language it's a Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection on uh in the life that's what new testament Grace means amen so he gives a Divine influence upon your heart and it's reflected in your life if you're humble amen who wants a Divine influence of the Holy Ghost his word to live in you amen and it's reflected out of your life so it's not just a you know we don't just walk around saying Thank You Lord but there's a power that comes into our lives that he manifests his word through us you know we're not helpless you know you're the most powerful people in existence the Bride of Jesus Christ amen God God can take a person remember that same God that said let there be sun moon and stars and you know and your man's put the James Wood telescope out there and is marveling at creation you know and the universes and everything and you know that same power that said let there be sun moon and stars comes and dwells and redeems Sons and Daughters of God and that creative power is still in existence you know the devil wants to be able to create but he cannot create so all he can do is pervert because he was perverted in his heart in the beginning and that perversions come down upon human beings amen but we're not here to be perverted amen we're here to be Sons and Daughters of God made in the image of God that God can take your vocal cords and speak a word of life to someone and someone who's even dead can come back to life again sickness can be gone amen The Impossible can be manifested amen because God takes over a life oh that's for the preacher no that's for every man woman and child that's fully surrendered to God that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so God gives grace to the humble and this is a day of great grace amen where where Zechariah would see it as a as a vision of the Capstone coming down this shouting's Grace Grace unto it I mean so as Christ comes down unites himself with a body there's a shouting of Grace Grace why this magnified Grace amen this sure there's a lot of evil in the world Hells opens opened itself up upon the Earth but remember God is always greater than what what anything the devil can do so all of the armies of hell it's like it's not just a part of the armies of Hell have come upon the Earth all that he is and his reserves and his militia and his Home Guard every man woman and child well I'm talking Devils now but basically everyone who can bear a gun has come out of hell is upon the battlefield I mean so he's not just sending a little Skirmish and a little scouting party and some special forces all of his artilleries here all of his arm is here all of his weapons are here but remember greater is he that's in you there's he that's in the world Amen Grace he is in you there's that all of hellers Amen you know one man a woman with God is the majority amen we don't need you sure there's power and numbers of Faith being joined together and you know we understand all those things but even if you feel alone you're still the majority with God I mean Moses was one man he went down to the superpower of the age amen took a children of Israel out of Egypt amen one man did it Hallelujah now how about you and I today amen remember he was just under the blood of bulls and goats amen and yet he could create flies and fleas and bring Darkness into all kinds of things because why he was fully surrendered to God he walked in humility he was once The Prince of Egypt walking in Pride and look who I am but God humbled him 40 years in the desert and when he really met guy the burning bush he realized he was nothing but it's about God takes nothing and makes it into something amen so it's very important we reckon ourselves that we are nothing now that's not enough feeling sorry pity party woe is me I'm just never going to amount to a hill of beans that's not what I'm talking about amen but it's recognizing that without him you can do nothing amen as the Lord would even say here he says I am the vine and yeah the branches he that abideth in me and I and him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing I like that kind of scripture because I realize actually the the you know remember God proves his word we don't prove his word god proves his word we don't have to make his word be fulfilled he fulfills his word in our lives but we're going to be surrendered to his word for it to be fulfilled so without him I can do nothing that's fine because that means the life and everything's gonna come from him through me and do what and he'll do what he wants to do so that takes a lot of pressure off because you know man wants to always try and prove himself proof of his ability prove how smart he is prove how clever he is prove how eloquent he is prove how much Charisma he may have or a talent or whatever but that doesn't work with the kingdom of God no God proves his word amen God proves his word in our lives they say Lord prove your word manifest your word Lord I without you I can do nothing remember the life the life comes from the vine into the branches amen and brother Ram said that if the if the vine ever puts forth another Branch it will write another book of Acts amen because every bronzer one ever puts forth amen writes a book of Acts behind in a supernatural testimony of the word of God being manifested Hallelujah amen see says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the Devil is a roaring lion walking walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you I like that amen you're going through an Affliction well the whole purpose after a while you're going to be made perfect you're going to be established you're going to be strengthened you're going to be settled amen so remember before something's ever established it kind of moves around a bit you know tossing turn for a reasoning worry emotion trouble but after a while you just become Rock Solid in the word of God God said it I believe it that settles it praise the Lord hey man you get strengthened I mean because you realize that your human ability cannot give you strength cannot keep you walking this walk but then God pours in his strength why because he gives grace to the humble amen then you're settled why don't you sit alone that the word is true every promise is mine amen God is a god of his word amen Hallelujah Hallelujah you see now we must fight for humility right we must we must fight for humility we're not here to fight for it because remember the whole purpose of us being here is that souls are added to the kingdom remember brother Bram told us that we should be prayerfully seeking the lost that the last one can come in that we can go home that should be our whole life subjective sure we need careers we'll have family we'll do different kind of things but underpinning all of that is Lord bring your sheep here bring your children that they can meet you they can know you they can fall in love with you that we can go home who wants to go home there's no place like home amen so you know and when I'm talking about home as heaven right we should have such a longing Lord I want to see you as you are I want to be caught up in a I want to be translated in a moment of a twinkling of an eye and see you face to face Hallelujah that should be our hearts cry more than anything else you see because there's Jude would Jude would speak about we must con earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints now that's just not the just the right correct Doctrine we know that's part of it right but it's more than that we've got to contend for a walk of humility I mean a walk that we're not selfish it's not us being puffed up or Pride you know we must contend against those things I mean we must contend against any man exalting himself above another man I mean we must contend against manipulation and politics and all this nonsense that goes on we must contend against those things because if we contend for the faith we're contending for God dwelling in a people once again Amen robed in humility walking in meekness I mean amen walking according to his word Hallelujah that's what we should that's what we should be doing this morning I mean because remember a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent right all powerful and we'll get to that but I want to build around that because you're going to realize the power that lays within you but it's not you that operates that power it's God that operates that power amen it's God that anoints his word in our lives amen but we've got to be surrendered to the Lord that whenever he wants to he can amen remember it's humility remember if God resists the prayer but gives grace to the humble right so so if we're humble then we can come boldly before us thrown in time of need right we can come bold but if we're proud thinking we've got it all together you know if someone thinks they epitomize Christianity you know one thing they don't you know it's quite simple if they think man I've made it you know I'm a I'm an adopted son of God and I can do it all myself and I know what I'm doing you know one thing they have no idea they have no idea see the Lord Jesus never exalted himself like that he was surrendered to the father right he was surrendered to the word of God he knew exactly who he was but didn't make him proud he didn't walk around saying look I made this whole thing I'm gonna wipe this off I'm gonna do what I'll do it nice is he only did what the father showed him yeah right and that was to remember we want to be like Jesus today right so that's his attitude so we should have that same attitude amen humility is to have a humble opinion of oneself a deep sense of one's moral in Brackets littleness modesty humility Lawless of lowness of Mind loneliness of mind now as I said before that doesn't mean you walk around saying I'm nothing I'm worthless worthless worse worthless there we go we got there eventually you know I'm glad someone's listening he's not speaking just right you know praise the Lord you know we shouldn't walk around thinking we're useless and we're not important we are very important to God if Jesus died on Calvary for one he would have done it all the same amen if if the Rapture was for one so this message of rapturing Faith was for one he would have had brother Bram go through all of what he went through and brother bran would have went through it gladly that the word would have come open the lamb could take the book give it to an adopted son or Son of God that could be preached to you and then manifested in your life then you go home it was just for one he would have done it all for one amen so you're very important to God I mean you're not just a number you're not just a statistic you're not just a bunch of genes walking you know your jeans as in jeans DNA you know you're not just part of the gene pool right you're thinking clothing just for a second there but let's go beyond that right I'm talking about g-e-n-e Gene right amen we're very special to God you should feel special they feel special hey man you should feel special the Lord the Lord has done all things for you and it was only for you if heaven was literally you and God he would have done it all the same that's how much value he's put upon your soul amen so so when I talk about having a you know loneliness of mind you know I can't even kind of double guessing how I reach stuff now maybe I should go back to school anyway you know don't think you're useless and you're not important but you should say no God's word is more important than me what he says is more important than what I say what he thinks is more important than my opinion how he feels is more important than I feel right that's how we should that should be how our mind should be amen because he the Lord would say uh be not called uh but be not you called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are Brethren hey Brethren how we doing hallelujah amen and call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be called Masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant amen whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a base and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted amen and to me this uh to be exalted uh to me what it means is that you see the word of God living in power in your life you see the character of Christ manifested in your life you see the devil under your feet Amen to me that's being exalted because because remember when Adam and Eve fell then Satan became king of the Earth right and then they became slaves to sin and then sin nature ruled amen but then when but then when someone really humbles themselves as we heard about on Wednesday about really being born again when you're willing to let your Ambitions your habits your pride your ability what you think you are everything burn on the altar when you're willing to lay yourself completely lay down I mean you're willing to surrender everything because that's the thing I think the problem is we no this okay I better be careful how I say this people can be so blessed by the anointing of God and be anointed by God but still they're not born again and they can have great experiences but they're not born again they're just anointed all those things are God that's why I'm looking forward to Camp I'm looking forward to this service I'm looking forward to every service we're going to have a look forward to every time we can pray or you know God can anoint mightily but it takes a real death for the soul to come to life it takes a real death and we and and brother Ram says even Branham Tabernacle was afraid of the new birth how about Chicago Tabernacle are we afraid of the new birth Amen to try and bypass everything but to be born again see because unless you're born again you cannot see or understand the kingdom of God I mean we must be born again it's fundamentally important but until we're willing to lay ourselves upon the Altar and die out to everything we'll get nothing you know so we want to we must be born again it's a it's an absolute must you have an experience where God changes your nature and desires amen that he changed it you see there's a change it's not just I was raising the message that means nothing that's like saying I live in a garage therefore I'm a car no you're not a car because you live in a garage right you got to be made a car to be a car right just like amen you're with me yeah see you so well I was I was raised here I was born in this church you know in a family that's got nothing to do with it you must be born again amen our our children do not become Believers just because they're raised in Christian homes sure that helps them a great big deal when they live in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost but they must surrender themselves to the Lord and even many adults we need to have a new birth experience right it's not just well you become set in your ways that I'm a Christian now this is what I do don't just become sin in your ways let God burn out all sin nature and all those things that when Trouble Comes Grace comes out it's not fighting and fussing and and little schemes and manipulation all those things none of that comes out it's just God comes out things I mean that's what we want we don't want to have it just me and trying to have a lordship over someone control someone a certain way that's got to be gone that's that's Satan's uh what do you call it personality or or attributes and to human beings amen but we're not called to live with those things I remember but the blood of Jesus Christ should exalt us over those things I mean we're placed above sin nature amen that is not just us trying to cope with problems but they're burnt out of our Lives I believe in a cleansing fire of God Amen that really burns out all unbelief all sin nature all of those complexes pains and hurts it really Burns it out halleluia and I believe his Burning Flame is present amen because where he is he is a consuming fire Hallelujah so if you want to be exalted well let God lift you up be humble if you ought to be brought down exalt yourself look at me look who I am I'm the I'm the number one here I'm the Kingpin I'm the I'm the vital ingredient in the mix no the only vital ingredient is the Lord right because whatever man puts together just like you know with I think it was Elijah Elijah or the sons of the prophets from the school the prophets you know were making a pot of food and some got some poison gourds and put it into the pot you know this is man's doing let's mix this all together it just brought forth death I mean but the one thing that cured all of that was the meal offering it was the meal that the prophet put in which is Christ put into the pot and it brought forth life it's sustained so the main part of the mix is him right if man puts any of his own ability in it just causes death that's why Nature's falling God isn't causing nature to fall apart God isn't causing all these wars and troubles and famines and sorrows and pain that's Fallen man under control of a fallen devil yeah amen so it's not you know you say well there's going to be a nuclear war that's not God's fault people you know big disasters come through I remember the Christchurch earthquake you know they call it Christ Church but it's a Godless place just like the rest of this world then the earthquake happens and people like why did God let this happen why are you suddenly blaming God are you walking with them you know what's you know why is he sounding the fault what are you doing you know but that's the only time God ever comes into the public you know conversation has been saying bad happens oh we're going to blame somebody I'm not blaming me it's this guy you know we should never be that way but we should be we should be humble and know that he's in control of all things amen no brother that makes a statement in order to stay with God stay gentle who wants to stay with God today God is gentle in order to stay with God stay with love God is love stay Meek never be self-sufficient so in other words never take a thought that is contrary to the word of God and say I'm going to think this this is the right way to do it always rely upon him never use your own mind take his thoughts we say well how do I find his thoughts you know and I could hold up the message in the same token as well I mean let his thoughts be your thoughts that's a good idea and then take them into your car you just think about okay I'm sorry I'm harping on about the world but you think about what if the U.N took this quote and see this is going to be our Charter this is going to be our Charter for the world we're going to take God's thoughts and let them become our thoughts worldwide poverty is gone war is gone basically it's like a millennium would just come in mental health gone all the trouble in the world would just go if the world just said hey God what's your thoughts I want them to become my thoughts that you would live because remember if you really take honest thoughts you can't be a proud person amen you can't be proud if you've taken on a search you cannot be but humble Hallelujah let his thoughts be your thoughts take them into your car no mind repeat them over and say oh God take all of my doubt away let my thoughts be your thoughts and you sick people I do that as we're speaking just take away Cast Away the thought of sickness take God's healing thoughts let them become your thought think upon these things the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things amen if you have trouble in your mind take his thoughts you'll find that those troubled thoughts are gone you know and then now what thoughts of Peace have come in you feel unloved think on his thoughts you'll feel loved if you don't feel part of a part of a family think on his thoughts you'll feel part of a family if you're feeling worth useless you've got no ability think on his thoughts you'll feel like yes the Lord's given me ability amen hallelujah it's a it's a good prescription I think Hallelujah amen now he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus see you got to let it in God don't God don't mug you take out your thinking put us thinking in and say here you go you know enjoy that no we've got to let him we're going to yield you know and to me it's one of the most powerful things is the ability to yield to the word of God amen you say I don't have a gift well if you've got a gift to be able to yield to the word of God that's the greatest gift because God can do whatever he wants in your life you get surrendered to him in every situation amen let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant it was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name Hallelujah so so this is our example he made himself of no reputation he was the one who made sun moon and stars became flesh he could have he could have spoken a palace into existence and be birthed in the palace you know he could have had the best he could have had the best penthouse suite in in Jerusalem you know far beyond but he said foxes have dens birds have nests but the son of man has no place to lay us here here's a homeless man they're very God who made all things was homeless because he when he robed himself in humility now we don't have to become homeless to be humble but he surrendered himself to the word of God concerning him amen he knew that he had to be mad more than any other man he knew he was the Lamb of God take away the sin of the world he knew he'd be despised and rejected of man and man acquainted with grief and sorrow he knew that was his portion but he humbled himself to it we've never had a day like he did on Calvary we've never had a day like that but he had a day like that and he knew he was going to have that day and he saw it by a vision before he stepped into it he wasn't saying I wonder how this is going to happen or what you know what's going to he knew he had to be crucified but he knew exactly how many times we've beaten all the mockings this rejection the pain the hurt any carried the sin of the world upon his shoulders no one's ever had a day like that but he had a day like that but because he but because he was humble he could submit himself to the word of God the joy that was set before him was you redeemed so he could gladly do it and how about us just be baptized right well I don't know that's not humility just dress in a modest way well I don't know where's the humility to obey the word you know we need the humility of the Lord Jesus Christ to fulfill amen his word just be just Place ourselves on the altar let him take control I don't know where's the humility well I was raising the message that's all very nice but there's no merit badges around here we're not the Boy Scouts Girl Scouts Cubs whatever more sea Scouts whatever Scouts we're not Scouts okay you're in the wrong place if you think this is a scat Hall it's not see it's not about merit badges it's about knowing him now if you look at Shepherds because um you know brother Arman preached on the humble king or the noble King so I was thinking about the shepherd King hallelujah amen that's my king that's my king a Shepherd has a very unglamorous job there's no glamor being a shepherd out early you think about imagine imagine waking up out in the out in the fields or even you know as as the Lord Jesus said here's the door to the Sheepfold and brother bam says that in those days there was one big Corral the Sheep came in at night and the Shepherd lay as the gate to the Sheep so imagine waking up amen and you got frost over your blanket I mean you're cold you've heard the bleeding of the sheep you haven't got much sleep but you know that's where you slept at night you slept on the job you didn't just clock out and say I'm going home you know and then complain about traffic and all these things no you stay on the job right wake up Frost in the morning there's sickness among the flock there's trouble you gotta watch out for you know the Wolves and the Bears and all these things it's not a glamorous job but but our lord Jesus became the lowest of the low he became the humble King amen that he would exalt a people above himself he would take a bride and he would lift her up in the end time that's why I became humble because he wanted to show Satan this is what this is what my blood will achieve this is what my life will do is I'll take a people who are born in sin bought an iniquity born lost with sin nature and I'll give my life amen that in the end time I'll wave them above you Satan and say this is what I've achieved Satan you can't take them they're in the palms of my hands they're part of me and I'll use her to give you your final blow upon the Earth [Music] Hallelujah This Is Our God he's not proud he's not look at me and how awesome I am now he raises the people say look at my finest achievement amen you're his finest achievement this morning amen and Satan's Eden we can live in Satan's eat it and not want a single Speck of it Hallelujah all of the religion New Age nonsense the politics the atheistic ideas the science whatever it is the sport whatever it is there's nothing in it that we want because he's so changed our nature so I'm going to show you the power of my blood I mean you can live in the darkest of Ages but yet Shine Like the Sun Hallelujah that's what God has made us to be this morning amen why because of people fully surrendered to God omnipotent amen thank you God put that spoken word of Creation in the bride of Christ Hallelujah that's our Shepherd that's our Shepherd Hallelujah but you see a shepherd's message because he's the shepherd King that kind of message comes to Shepherds I mean it didn't it didn't cut it doesn't come to the the word comes to the humble I'm not just talking about having a culture of being a Christian because it's our culture now I'm saying the word The Living Word comes to the humble amen if you want the word of God to be made flesh in your life be humble that's why the Lord spoke to us last Sunday be humble thyself their souls that must come in I want to see births I want to see a lambing season Hallelujah I know we all want to see that amen do we not but you see the humble a humble message I remember because remember the greatest message that ever came to the Earth the greatest announcement of the greatest birth that could ever happen upon the Earth was given to Shepherds it wasn't given to the high priest it wasn't announced in Jerusalem and the temple and all the great schools of learning it didn't come to gamalia or whoever the rabbi the rabbis was the Angels never went there amen they went to Shepherds on the field why because it had to come to Humble Shepherds why because a God of all humility amen was born upon the earth and the only ones that could receive that King were made of the same stuff Amen to the angels came down into the promised land they couldn't they couldn't come to the high priest they couldn't come to anyone who thought they were something they came to the outcasts of society you think those Shepherds would be welcome in the temple do I have a bath first buddy you stink like your flock are you just a poor little homeless Shepherd living out on the street Leo but yet it came to Humble Shepherds amen and that and the angel said that Christ the Messiah is born upon the Earth amen and where was he born he was born in a stinking manger over a manure power with a bunch of animals a very Lord Of Glory Emmanuel became flesh and the reason it came to Shepherds is the Shepherds felt home where the Messiah was Hallelujah and it's got to be the same way today amen amen we're gonna have the same heart humility as the word that we'll feel comfortable to go where the Messiah is and the Messiah is his word amen see you'll never be able to go to the word actually to him unless you have the humble heart that he has Hallelujah so he bypassed everybody and came to Humble Shepherds why because it was a message because the god of humility was born upon the Earth amen and you see but the thing is you see what the angel told them they found amen what the angel told them they found amen the seventh angel has announced the message God has used the seventh angel in this end time to announce a message that Messiah is upon the Earth that Christ's word is upon the Earth amen Remember All That Heaven is is upon the Earth right now you may not realize it but you know the only thing that we do not have is the physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ all that he is is upon the Earth all of his power all of his anointing all of his blessings all that he has is upon the Earth but we're going to meet his physical body in the air that's what Believers believe amen Believers Believers no physical Return of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're going to meet him in the air but his holy spirit is upon the Earth remember His holy spirit is no less power or ability just because he is not here remember the Centurion went to Jesus said my servant is sick right Jesus says I'll come into your house and pray for he says I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof just speak the word only and my servant will be well amen that is Gentile Faith because his faith realized that Jesus speaking the word wasn't exactly the same as him physically walking into the house laying his hands upon the servant and pronouncing him him well amen that is Gentile Faith that's why it's so just speak the word amen believe the word and that word will go and produce what it promised it will produce that's why we could have Maggie in the hospital in Wellington but we can speak the word in prayer amen we can speak it here and God will go perform that which he said in his word amen I believe that don't you amen that's that is Gentile faith Hallelujah amen but we're going to realize now see so what they said they'd find they found we what the seventh Angels said would find we're found Christ is alive his word is true he's here to fulfill amen the wrap-up is Plan of Redemption you see in order to be humble we must do the opposite to the devil the devil only thinks about himself he don't care about his other angels that fell with him he doesn't care about anyone he has his own ambition that's it but Jesus will pray sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have I or uh even so have I also sent them into the world for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth so he's saying Lord I sanctify myself for their sakes I put their needs above my need I don't put my needs above their needs see humility to be surrendered the word of God you know it's actually not for you only it's for those around you I mean that's why we should always have the heart of the Lord Jesus saying Lord I sanctify myself I'm willing to give up stuff that robs me of my time I'm willing to give up addictions and things that just rob me of my time amen for their sakes what is for their sake said God you'd come live in my life then an atmosphere of power the Holy Ghost would live around me that they would drop into it and meet the Lord Jesus amen just like brother and Paul said on Wednesday that we should lead our children into the new birth that's a responsibility of a parent to leave it's not just to say don't do this and do this and stop this instead of no we should create an atmosphere around us sure we raise them and train them sure but our whole Hearts desires Lord anoint me that they would be led into a new birth experience not just a bit of a conviction but a full death to self and be born again you don't have to receive you know it's not just receiving holy ghost in a church or at a camp you can receive it at home Hallelujah he's the same God at home he should be amen he's the same God at home because he said I'll never leave you nor forsake thee amen so that should be a harsh desire so we should really say Lord whatever's robbing me of my time get it out of me because I want to see my children know you Lord Evan's a bad attitude fussing against someone whatever it is doesn't matter what's taking up your time lord burn it out of me Lord because I want to be Sanctified for their sake I mean because our children deserve a holy ghost Revival they deserve to see a book of Acts they deserve to see every promise that God manifested in their lives that's what our children deserve amen that's their inheritance amen amen they deserve to see a father and mother that love each other I mean they're not not trying to you know sway the children against the other and all these things they deserve parents that are not selfish hey man amen this is what our children deserve amen amen so we should have this Heart Lord I sanctify for their sakes I sanctify myself yes amen Jesus said the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things over he doeth their uh these all also doeth the sun likewise so he was led he was humble he is surrendered to the word of God I mean now we know that compassion is very a very misunderstood thing compassion really Bible compassion is to follow the will of God not human sympathy but compassion oh it's two different words altogether sympathy and compassion see if it wasn't Jesus sure made a rude mistake when he did that see and he's talking about when he went to the pool of Bethesda you know and there's all those sick ones there but he only went to one and healed one but why he was led by a vision to that one now that doesn't mean we don't have human sympathy we should sympathize we should have beating hearts that feel every kind of emotion right amen amen it's what you do with that emotion we know that I'm just talking about on the positive side but you see we should have human sympathy but don't we but we mustn't be led by human sympathy we must be led by the will of God amen if we uh if we are humble then I believe we will be led by Godly compassion amen but you see the danger is because the devil is no respecter of persons if he can't make you think you are useless and God can't use you he'll make your stuff shirt thinking you are the great Cog in the wheel God is the great Cog of the wheel he's the important one see he said he was talking he turned around he's talking to a brother he's who who said to him I just read a certain brother's book that told us that after we received the Holy Ghost we should seek after gifts for uh for these to use this Holy Ghost I said and become a stuffed shirt see if you notice in the Bible it's always those who are trying to get away from it that God uses as long as a man wants to do something and thinks he's got enough ability he can put the job over God can never use that man so if you never want to be used by God in your life think you can do it that's a real simple rule but if you think you can't do it then God can use you and he'll do it amen look at Moses running look at Paul running and the rest of them trying to get away from it I said don't seek nothing God has got uh God has got anything for you he'll give it to you see and just let him take care of that I said even then you get some of these times like we got have today that everybody's wanting to do this and do that and become some great person look what we got into with it you see instead of trying to be great we ought to try and uh be trying to find out how little we can get see then God can use us that's how we should be amen not trying to be some great big person but let God be the great person because he is the great person let's get everyone let's get everything into perspective he's our father he's our everything he made everything he saved us by his grace and here we are enjoying the benefits of everything he has done Holly just enjoying the goodness of God Amen so he's the great person Hallelujah amen see God wants to take you and use you as an enzyme as a banner that his blood works hey man see let me tell you brother when ye are dead and your life is hidden Christ through God and sealed by the Holy Ghost and God lifts you up in Heavenly places you'll be an enzyme that a work of God has a a work of God has been committed in you Jesus in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe what kind of an enzyme is it some great stuff shirt no humility the fullness of God in Christ Jesus made him walk like a humble peasant made him wash the feet of his disciples had not a place to lay his head some of us calling ourselves Christians we go to a place uh you've got we've got to have the best there is in the country got to be guaranteed so much money we won't go the Evangelist some pastors won't go to a church unless it's high class and a big place oh my we need another experience like Paul saw when he's on the road to Damascus Paul saw that enzyme lifted up he said who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus what we need tonight is another Pillar of Fire hanging over the church again tonight I'll say this morning that people's bloated eyes would be open and could see it amen CeCe God when he does a work in our lives he makes us to walk in humility because he walked in humility amen now if you look at the power of the devil how a man who's filled with the devil can be seven times stronger than a natural man right now if Satan can give that kind of a power to a man fully surrendered to him how much more power can the Holy Spirit put on a man that's fully surrendered to him I mean to make a person in a wheelchair rise and walk to make the shadow of a man dying with cancer on a to jump to his feet screaming under the power of God for how much stronger is God than the devil now we know the devil is defeated at Calvary he's he's conquered he's done amen so so but if the devil has power how much more does God have power are you following me right now I mean we're going to realize that if we're fully surrendered to God God can move in a way we in ways that we can't even really imagine I'm just trying to put a faith in us you know God is all-powerful but he wants to step into our lives and manifest his glory amen but a man fully surrendered to God Amen is omnipotent I'm just going to come to this I was talking about it right see see the see our lord Jesus cut every obstacle from human beings amen that we might be connected like in the Garden of Eden I'm gonna I'm gonna finish soon okay so don't get too you know we're all right right so I see see man in the Garden of Eden had dominion over everything amen and God wants to restore our people back into that same condition that they have dominion over every sickness disease or death fear whatever it may be nature everything right amen BC now he our lord Jesus has already made us thus he doesn't have to come and die again for more no one by one offering for all he has perfected them that are Sanctified right amen so when Jesus died on Calvary that's all he had to do in terms of purchasing our Redemption amen it was fully paid for that day amen so now see he says now man is omnipotent so man is all-powerful that's what omnipotent means you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God as omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you've said what happens when two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together two omnipotents Uh something's got to shake I mean we say well I made them years ago but what about today I mean when we have great needs in our midst today what about when two omnipotents meet today something's got to shake I mean hell's got to move I mean sickness has got to back up amen when two omnipotents meet I mean whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of the omnipotence of God knowing that he promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not and makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful and you can go through the Bible and see when two omnipotents met too omnipotents met in the days of Noah Noah was lifted above the judgment to a new world two omnipotents men the days of Moses Moses took amen Israel out of Egypt right too omnipotents meant with Joshua before they crossed Jordan the wall of Jericho came tumbling down they took the land right Germany poters met when David before David fought Goliath yeah you can take it all the way through the scripture two omnipotent something's got to shake amen and it's not the Kingdom of Heaven that shakes is the kingdom of hell that shakes amen because why because there's power that comes into a human being that fulfills the word of God see we're not living with an argument friends this is not a debate an argument collection of ideas this is reality Hallelujah praise the Lord and and you say well how can we be omnipotent I need Scripture well Jesus said if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth all things are possible not some things all things are possible to them that believe the Bible says if two agree on Earth concerning anything the Lord will do it we need to start agreeing with one another just be in agreement there's a need we agree one for another God's going to fulfill his word amen someone's lost in the world we're going to agree God's gonna bring them home amen because he says concerning anything that's a lot of things now you know if you really agree considering a promise that God is not a selfish thing it's not I need a mansion let's agree I need a new car no nothing like that we're talking about real things they actually matter amen but you see now a character I just gonna drop down with remember characters of Victory and not a gift so humility is not a gift it's a victory right to be humble it's a it's a victory what is it a victory it's a victory over self and what we think we are if you want to be humble you gotta this thing's got to be conquered right the only way to conquer it is place it on God's Altar and let them burn it out amen but not just die but stay dead that's the challenge we're going to stay dead under the hand of God that God can live amen so that's the only way we can really stay be humble and stay humble is that we realize that that character is a victory it's not a God just doesn't hand it out like a lolly right it's a victory there's a thing that we've gotta because a man without character can't Reign because power apart from characters say satanic but Power with character is for to rule amen now I'm just going to come down to this right we're we have afflictions in life right we have afflictions in life some do I'm glad yeah some people are honor some people are just living a if you don't have any Affliction tell me how you live and I wanna because no one no one no one signs up for punishment right anywho but notice the Apostle Paul here but we see that this treasure uh we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed amen so therefore we can have trouble on every side yet we're not distressed it's how I feel a bit distressed but you're actually not distressed I mean because your Help Cometh From The Lord amen that we can look beyond our trouble on every side say no this trouble's not going to destroy me this trouble is not going to take my faith from me amen what the world can't take away the world didn't give right this faith that I have the world didn't give it to me this love that I have the world didn't give it to me this joy that I have the love the world didn't give it to me the and the world didn't give it the world can't take it away amen we can be persecuted but that doesn't mean we're forsaken well I'm really receiving a lot of heat no but that doesn't mean you're forsaken yeah I mean hey man cast down but not destroyed who's felt cast down sometimes that doesn't mean you're destroyed Hallelujah always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith so notice he's talking about these afflictions and troubles but now he comes down with a spoken word comes into manifestation manifestation we having the same Spirit of Faith according it as is written I believed and therefore have I spoken ye we also believe and therefore speak amen so the ability to speak in faith has got nothing to do with the amount of Reflections troubles distress being cast down whatever's going on in your life amen amen you're with me amen so we maybe have trouble on every side that doesn't mean this mouth can't speak the promises of God Amen we be we may be distressed we may have trouble we may have all kinds of things persecution being cast down whatever's going on that doesn't mean we can't take the word and faith and lift it before God Hallelujah amen knowing that he that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise uh up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes at the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of God for this cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is for but a moment worketh for us are more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen this is what we're not looking at we're not looking at symptoms we're not looking at what we see we're not looking at whatever's going on we don't look at those things right amen amen we while we not look at while we look not at things that are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen and if you're walking humbly that means you're not self-sufficient that man is not you trying to do the job that you are not in the equation and the ability for God to make his word come to pass but if you are walking humbly you can look beyond the eye and the me and the how of I and you know and you look at him which is the Unseen to the promises of God you look Beyond like I remember brother Ron Spencer when he was um when he was uh when he was you know three years ago when he was diagnosed diagnosed with stage four cancer and the Lord told him look beyond what you see and think beyond what you think so the Lord's telling him you've got to look Beyond this this cancer in your body and what you think the the natural thoughts about it you're gonna look Beyond those things to the promises of God amen and I believe if we're walking humbly with the Lord we know Lord everything's in your control we're never out of your care you've allowed this for a reason right and we can trust you in the storm amen Hallelujah amen praise the Lord now I'm just going to finish with this quote so I feel like we're having scramble leagues today but enjoy the scrambled eggs it says Church of the Living God here and on tape too do you know where you stand do you know that you're that you were called of God that the Holy Ghost Reigns in your heart and every word of God is real to you do you know that hey man if you walk into humility the word Reigns in your heart what it rains in you amen the Holy Ghost race because it's not you it's not my will but his will be done right oh brother how is Satan gonna stand against that how's he ever going to make that person proud how is it going to make that person arrogant how is he ever going to make that person self-sufficient amen because ultimately that's that's what the devil wants to try and do make us walk in this flesh be carnal think well this is how I think it should be in my opinion this you know this is what Mike you know and going by experience above the word of God we should always go by the word of God more than anything amen hey man see how is it going to stop that from growing how's it going to keep them signs from following it why you could throw them in jail they if if you could I don't care what you do they've done tried it they write it in the jails are fed to Lions they were sword asunder they were jerk to pieces you can't kill it right a church that's predestinated those who he foreknew he did like he did Jesus he was called those who he called he is Justified and those who he has Justified he is also glorified and now in the last days with every seed sowed everything in order the the world is uh in its order but time shaped up the church and its order the sea the evening lights the signs like he said as it was in the days of Sodom an angel of God the Holy Spirit coming down moving performing the signs that he did then Malachi 4 promised that he had sinned in the last days what he promised and we see and we see all of that right here where where amen amen amen amen dear love him amen sure right here in the last days pardon me a previous day of church knowing where they're standing sowed with the seed the Holy Spirit and the church he says Satan be careful hey man we know where children are the most high God we know we've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb we know that we are trophies of his grace and then we know that we've been bought with a price the precious blood of Jesus Christ we know we're not our own I mean we know wherever we go in life you know if we're fully surrendered to God God will lead us through right we know that it's humility that we must be robed by him and we know that we're not just saved in a haphazard way but he saved us to keep us hello so we know where we're standing though we may be in though we may be cast down though we may have great troubles all around amen but see God allows trouble God allows these things to happen to us but we're not forsaken we haven't lost we're not down and out we may be down but we're not down and out Amy we can get back up and say Lord I want to walk with you again I have I want to walk in humility again Lord maybe forgive my pride that's come up and think I can do it but say Lord Purge that of me Lord that I can walk in humility with you Lord forgive me for holding on for holding on to grudges and being offended at people for no real reason even if there is a reason don't hold on to it amen Jesus Jesus died that we'd receive every Redemptive blessing so let's walk in humility and obtain every blessing and his season as he gives it to us right amen I mean let's have the musicians amen please this morning amen our great Shepherd amen Brothers is in one place they don't have it here never let an arrogant Spirit come around you like you know everything always
