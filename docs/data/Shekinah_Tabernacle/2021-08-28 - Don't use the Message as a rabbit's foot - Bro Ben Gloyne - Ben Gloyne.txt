thank you [Music] is [Music] now i am [Music] now i am a reflection of this [Music] [Music] amen praise the lord um so i was going to sort out a technical issue here all right hey man how's everyone today anyone doing well i mean god bless you all uh let's uh so first we actually have a few birthdays so um brother paul happy birthday god bless you thanks for having a real pleasure today eating lots of cake and very spoiled and then god bless you my friend amen and also tomorrow we have naomi friesen's birthday so god bless you amen hope you have a wonderful day and also we have uh tomorrow's thingy's birthday as well god bless you thingy amen praise the lord god bless you amen praise the lord um let's just go to the scripture trust everyone's well um hold on i've got a slide show i want to share so i'm just trying to i mean but yeah praise the lord um the lord's mercies are new every morning and i want to thank the lord we can gather in this way i mean so let's just see if we can now can anyone see that okay yep brilliant so let's go to judges 17. um judges 17 and verse 1 uh so christie and i were talking about this during the week and it's amazing when you look into uh the book of judges or i mean the scripture we know i've got the scripture later but we know all scriptures for doctrine for a proof uh that the you know for correction that the matter of exhortation that the man of god can be fully furnished so um all scriptures are inspired for this so even if we we're gonna go through this chapter here and um it's really every scripture is applicable for us in this end time let's just read here uh if you'd like a title for this this may sound a bit out of left field somewhere but i'd like to call this don't use the message as a like a rabbit's foot so don't use the message like a lucky rabbit's foot so judges 17 and one if i'm there yeah no judges 17 and 1. and there was a man of of mount ephraim whose name was micah and he said to his mother the 1100 shekels of silva that were taken from thee about which thou curseth and spaketh of also in mine is behold the silver is with me i took it and his mother said blessed be thou of the lord my son and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silva to his mother his mother said i am wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will restore it unto thee yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took 200 shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of micah and the man micah had had an house of gods and made an ephod and a terraphin and consecrated one of his sons to become his priest in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes i mean if you want to keep that chapter handy they'll be they'll be real good malicious bowheads in a word of prayer this morning may seem like an unusual reading but i believe the lord has something in here very personal for all of us so this is bow heads in a word of prayer if you want to be remembered and praised want to lift your hand before the lord i mean god bless you the lord sees every raised hand let's pray gracious heavenly father thank you once again that we can gather lord even though we are separated by distance we want to thank you that we could use this technology dear lord that we can gather as a people father we can come under your anointing lord jesus i pray father that you'd be so real in every house lord every location that this service is being streamed lord i pray you'd be very real be very alive lord i pray father you are the great quickening spirit spirits i pray that you will quicken your word to every heart today o god may there be no distractions glory to just want to bind every hindering spirit of the devil in the name of jesus christ lord that you can have free course oh god that you can punctuate lord through every any darkness or anything oh god and just anchor your word into our souls and lord that will bring forth a hundredfold for your glory dear god we thank you for this day let's pray you just bless us lord in your presence we thank you so much lord we can gather in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats uh this morning so the book of judges we know is a is an account of really a a cycle of revival and death where the first generation comes into the land and then they and then they uh you know take take their portion of the land but then the next generation comes in and then what happens is they fall into idolatry you know they begin to backslide then an enemy comes in and oppresses them then then they call out to god and then god seems to deliver it and the deliverer delivers them and now they're living in freedom but it's not very long after that then another enemy comes in because of the people's backsliding and worshiping other gods and you know and then and then the enemy oppresses them then they call out for deliverance again and then god sends another deliverer and then god delivers them then the people walk in liberty again only to fall into idolatry again now we know that we are living in a day where it's the end of these cycles but the thing is just because a dispensation is coming into fulfillment it does mean everyone is walking according to that dispensation now we read here in uh verse six in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes now some people say but we have a king the lord jesus christ we're living in a different era but that may be true to the bride but how about you personally is he your king or are you doing that which is right in your own eyes because we know that everyone believes they are right you know everyone believes they're on the right track they're doing the right thing but it's god really should be our measuring stick or our mirror that we should look into the word of god and we should see is our lives telling up with the scripture now we're not talking about our lives telling up for the scripture i'm not talking about a mental acknowledgement of doctrine i'm not talking about dressing right only or or you know doing those things or i'm talking about a life that's lived is the life of christ manifested in your life because we know that this message has come i mean not just to restore bible truth but that god would live in a people once again brother brahm says that the holy ghost that was bound at the doors of creeds and dogmas has been released in the end time by the message of the hour because of being restored back to a true word of god now to me this is astounding where if you just take this picture here now here's believers they're living in the promised land they they they are living in their inheritance but yet there's a family here and this is really not just this family but you could say this is a condition of the people where where they have gone such to a lukewarm condition that here is a people who think they are doing the lord a service they think they are serving god and god would be pleased with them but yet they have idols in their home they would take something that was cursed and now they make that you know this is read here let's just read verse three i just want you to keep your focus if you could today and when he had restored the 1100 shekels of silver to his mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the ser um the silver unto the lord from the uh from my hand for my um from my hand for my son now if you just take that you think if she is wholly dedicated up she had a clear mind if she really had the mind of christ if i put it that way if she dedicated the syllable to the lord why on earth would she go and make idols out of it you see but because because she was a jew because she considered herself a believer she believed everything she did that has a religious connotation god will bless but that's not how god works god we have to live according to god's program we have to live according to his word we can't just take our own ideas and agree and say well you know it's good enough because i'm doing it you know and god must be pleased because i'm a believer we can't tread on that kind of ground we need to take god at his word i mean because god doesn't change his ways he's not he he he is no respecter of persons even the bible says to have to be irrespective of person is sin i mean so god's not going to be a respecter of person he's not going to exempt us from anything he's going to hold us to account now this may seem a rather heavy kind of message but you know the spirit of god is here for us to invite into our lives i mean that he can fulfill his word through us right so god doesn't put anything upon us that we cannot do because he has enabled us by his holy ghost to fulfill his word as if i'm with me so far so god is the enabler for us to be christians we can't be christians in our own strength we will just have a religious kind of a mess amen but if god comes and lives in our lives amen then he will manifest his word and that's what we amen are here to do praise the lord is everyone following me so far so you see even even this household that this man is in his mother has this warped idea that she can take silver and say i've dedicated to the lord but then make idols out of it so you know and and this may seem a bit kind of abstract but it's going to come right down on home okay so i'm i'm going somewhere just walk with me and um you see this is the thinking now here was this man micah and he had a house of god so he's a believer and he's got a house of gods and he had an ephod a terrific and he consecrated one of his sons who became his priest so in those days the priests were the levites this man wasn't a levite why on earth is he going outside of god's pattern to just make one of his sons a priest in his house you know why would you take the word and why would you walk it in such a way just to fit your own idea and unfortunately this is what many message people do they say well i believe all the mysteries i know the seven mystery mysterious everythings you know i know all the doctrine but if the life of god is not there that's just head knowledge that's an intellectual faith that doesn't do any good this message has come to change our character that will be conformed to his character amen that his life so he was full of mercy and grace sure but he you know you take the lord jesus he does not when god fully comes in all complexes pains and hurts amen demon spirits things are passed down through the family they go you walk a life of victory right you take the land you don't just say i believe the message and sit there and you're still sitting with the same old devil the same old problems i mean and you just remove yourself from them and think well i'll be fine no that's just removing yourself from the problem you know to overcome temptation is not just to remove yourself from it amen that's not actually overcoming because it doesn't change what's in here right to in order to overcome this must be changed and then when the temptation comes along if this has changed there's nothing in here that will want that temptation i mean it's very important amen that we let god cleanse us out i mean i don't want to be a house full of idols right we're a house aren't we i mean so lord take the take i think brother graham says take the bulldozer i mean of your word and go down our tin can alley and just bulldoze it away because remember this thing really this here look i've got this picture on the wall oh christian i'm dressing the part but this this could just be a veneer what about when you go beyond this what's on the inside because it's really what's on the inside matters and what's on the inside will manifest on the outside but many you know i just put it this way you can take a pig and paint up a pig it's still a pig on the inside but if you change the pig nature to a lamb nature that pig won't do what pigs used to do because the nature's changed it's the same thing with you and i we can't be painted like a painted up pig right we want to be lambs hallelujah and i believe by a center predestination we are lambs on the inside hallelujah and god can change us amen that what's really on the inside will come out praise the lord this this man he had a house of gods he consecrated one of his sons to be a priest it says in those days there was no king of the king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes now our king is meant to be the word of god the lord jesus christ not our own religious ideas not our reasoning you know the problem is is if you have so much truth you can reason things away with that truth amen when i came to the lord i was a dirty rotten stinking sinner from the world i had no leg to stand on i had no religious you know this you know shield that i could put up and say well you know i'm this or that no but the problem is if people are just raised up in church they can have a shield and say well i'm a good person i never did what other people did i stayed right here you know the danger of that is people can actually just be raised up in the message without a birth and they can just begin to become just nominal christians just going to church because it becomes a habit we don't want to be that way friends this message didn't come for us just to become nominal christians just go to church and just because this is what we do this is not what we do because what we do this is what we do because we love the lord and he's met us and transformed our lives and made us new creatures amen he's changed he's changed us amen he's really changed us that the old man's dead amen and his deeds are dead and his deeds do not get resurrected they do not come back i mean they have been killed by the blood of jesus christ hallelujah this is how we should be right because this is what this message came to do it didn't come to make us message people i mean there'll be a lot of message people will be stuck here when the rapture happens but this is not why we're here to be message people we are christians amen that believe this message is the lord jesus christ which is to prepare a bride to take us off the earth this is the reason you think about okay i think i'm getting ahead of myself but let's just go down to the next one so all scripture is given by inspiration of god is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works so i'm so some people don't like the old testament being preached from well i just say all scripture is given right it's an unbelieving spirit which will say the old testament doesn't apply today in some form i mean so you can't it's all inspired of god amen and it applies to you right now every man is right in his own eyes but the lord pondereth the hearts that man micah thought he was right amen he was right in his own eyes he was a believer he was a i'm a believer in the promised land amen hallelujah look how even you know look at all this religious stuff i've got i've even got my son's a priest come on you know he's consecrated he's been separated to this job you know he's not just some fly-by-night kind of guy he's a consecrated priest but he wasn't a levite it was just taking religious ideas and applying it to his life but not changing his life to match the word that's what brother ham says that we want our experiment experience to match god's bible right we don't want our experience to match anything but god's bible amen that's what we've got to have amen in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes now brother ramsay is now a man can have an intellectual faith and there is that is where most people get today calling themselves christians the reason you see such carrying on as you do under the name of christianity it's only intellectual faith so it's only up here i mean it can sound good it can sound reasonable it can make sense but if it doesn't come down here and transform the life it's only an intellectual faith friends we're not called to have an intellectual faith amen we're called to go on a sphere above that amen we're all things apostle with a revelation faith amen that doesn't only bring the promises of god to pass it changes our nature to match this character of jesus christ amen notice this and the man micah had a house of gods and made an ephod and tariff him and consecrated one of his sons who became a priest in those days there's no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes now an ephod is a girdle now this is just from the strong's concordance if you're wondering where i got this so it's a girdle especially an e-fighter or a high-priest shoulder piece or also generally an image so an ephod is something a priest would wear so there's nothing wrong with that right but it's also it can be an image amen but then this terrapin i thought was very interesting amen it means a healer it also means a family idol right idolatry immatures a terrorism so now here what this man is doing is he's consecrated one of his sons to minister with a family idol now when i talk about idols i'm going to talk about spirits i'm going to talk about complexes i'm not talking about a something that's been fashioned out of silver gold you know stone wood you know that's on a mental piece somewhere i'm not talking about that i'm talking about spirit so now the most dangerous thing in a family is a family spirit something that's been passed down from generation to generation to generation it becomes part of the family i mean you take a spirit of abuse you take a spirit of drunkenness depression i mean anxiety indifference can't forgive stubbornness those things are family traits they're spirits that are passed down through families so now here he had consecrated his son to minister this family spirit right this is what he's doing in his home amen and you know you've got to think about what you really minister will manifest in your life now i want to talk about man minister is is now i say lord help me because this is very much it always the word is a two-week assault it cuts both ways but you know what we minister we minister it by our words our actions what we talk about we're ministering something i mean so if we're ministering if we have a depressed depressed spirit we'll be ministering poor me and no one cares and look at my situation always inward down you know and that can become a familiar spirit right or you know anxiety or stubbornness unforgiveness what is stubbornness stubbornness is manifested by actions and words but it can become an idol why because people put it give it place in their lives we you know this is not built for the devil that's right we're not built we're not built i mean the human being is built to be a resting place or for almighty god i mean because he because god even said isaiah i made the stars i made the galaxies i made the universes the nebulas asteroids all kind of things i mean i made the solar systems you know i made the earth you know i made these things but where is the place of my rest and we should be able to say here i am lord i am rest amen my soul is the place of your rest amen so this is what we're built for we're not built to be a habitation of devils we're not built to be a habitation of idols and we're built to be the dwelling place of the living god amen so we don't want to so a family idol now brother brahm says this and sir we would see jesus you must never look at the things in the natural look at the spirit of anything you want to look uh you want to look at a city you look at the spirit of it you look at a family look at the spirits in the family i mean look at a man look at the spirit that's in him see anything you're looking at everything's got a motive and objective see he says look in the spirits look at the spirits in the family so they'll be family spirits hello amen they're all here unfortunately but you know the spirit of our family should be by the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen right so the blind family spirit i pray is the lord jesus christ amen not what i was born with not what i inherited you know we can't live in life saying poor me i'm a victim of circumstance we're not a victim of circumstance well actually there's one circumstance we should be a victim of and i'll put it this way which is the blood of jesus christ amen the salvation deliverance for our souls and our bodies we should be the victim of that i mean i've been impacted by an event amen that's changed my life hallelujah and it's not an abuse it's not a bad relationship it's not hurts and pains and resentment and unbelief and you know you know you know unforgiveness and it's not those things the one event i've been impacted by is the is the lord purchasing my salvation that day on calvary i mean and coming in this day to claim me holy to take me away in a rapture that's the that's the event we should be a victim of hey man if i can put it that way amen but the thing is the thing that impacts you most in your life is the thing you'll be manifesting so we want to be manifesting i mean the victory he'd won for us on calvary amen hallelujah now let's keep going on amen so now brother brown here he is speaking of a he so he's talking about an interview he has in the message called paradox i'm just going to read a bit of a lengthy reading here but you know he he's speaking to a father and a mother whose boy um has um he she's having a courtship with this girl and she does something to her and just or does something and and he just won't forgive her and they're all upset because they're shocked by by how he seems like a good christian boy you know but but yet he he responds in this way and and they're just perplexed by it so they go to the prophet and then brother brown begins to speak about their family lines and brings it down i'm just showing how how how family spirits right or a family idol is unfortunately inherited whether we like it or not but by the blood of jesus christ by the true new birth i mean those things are destroyed and kicked out it's good to have a house cleaning now you thinking you have and having it is two different things i mean oh we could just spend the rest of the service on that amen to think you know there's a big difference saying i think i have the holy ghost and really having it there's a big chasm of difference i mean because one is a mental i think i have and then normally there's a list of points well i got baptized i repented i got baptized all those things are good i mean i've received the work that's perfectly fine i believe all the doctrines i'm i go to church those things are all perfectly fine but there must come a place in your life where you meet god i mean with the same pillar of fire that was photographed with the prophet of the same purify that met you i mean because that pillar of fire is the same one that met moses that met paul and it came down in many forms you've got to meet that lord jesus you might be able to try and say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you possess what you're possessing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run sensations speaking in tongues or shouting whatever you make might lay it upon which is all right i believe in all of that and i absolutely do too but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree what it is jesus said by their fruits ye shall know them now this young fellow's parents his mother is german no reflection on the german but there is a strain in that family and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare right you stare you right in the face this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister i have come down the street many morning and this young lady be sitting out in the yard i'd say good morning to you she'd just look at me i'd stop i'd say sure a fine morning she she would just stand look right at you an intelligent woman i'd say come up to see her sometime she just stand and look well her brothers are that way father and mother is that way now the father of the boy is strictly an irishman moody high tempered high strong that's his whole family like that except one other out of the family converted that is this boy this fatherless mother are christians filled with the holy ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the lord now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old some something along there very fine kid and he's been a real model boy at home nice kid and he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls uh the the mother's family lives close to a fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no and they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they just won't do it it's just not in them now the genes and the father and and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted still remains in the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from this mother's family and they are not forgiving and they'll not apologize and that's where that boy stands now i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up i said now look at you out of out of your family all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people they just sit there won't speak very independent so forth irreverent to religion but i said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you are sweet and kind and forgiving what does it and your tree part of the family tree yet you have received the holy ghost that's the thing that makes you tender and sweet that's not your people anymore it's your christ that lives in you i said to the boy look at your family practically all them are drunks and so forth i said and how moody and high tempered and high strung but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the holy spirit you're no more what you are it's christ in you i said now that same thing has to happen to your son and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ and water baptism in the pool said i i know my son has come to christ so he was adamant he's a believer i said that maybe all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but until he's regenerated born again i'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on earth for her unless that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes in then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it christ will have to overcome it when he lets christ and then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit of god so in other words when the holy ghost comes in all those family idols those family idols are demolished in the name of jesus christ and the lord god takes up residence there amen and that's what we need friends that's very essential because even this mad boy outwardly looking i mean he was a good christian so it seems but in him that had to be taken out amen now let's continue on with our story and there was a young man out of bethlehem judah of the family of judah who was a levite and he sojourned there and the man departed out of the city from bethlehem judah to sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount e frame to the house of micah as he journeyed and monika said unto him when's cometh thou and he said unto him i'm a levite of bethlehem judah and i go to sojourn where i may find a place and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and i'll give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and and thy vituls so the levite went in and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was under him as one of his sons and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his priest and in the house and was in the house of micah and then micah said now i now know i that the lord will do me good seeing i have a levite to my priest again to me this is insanity they will take it and adapt it to their own lifestyle i mean a way that's pleasing to them they want jesus as their savior but not their lord their ruler so here he was now micah thought oh good you know i had my son as a priest but you know he's not a levite but the word says we need a levite to be a priest oh and he comes this levite and uh you know so he invites him because he wants to live the word right and so now finally he's got this levite as a priest so now he's thinking the lord's going to do me good seeing i have a levite to to my priest but this levite was now being a priest in a house full of idols this family spirit you know he was he had he had been away where were gone why on earth is this levite being a priest in a house full of idols when he could be ministering the word of god in its power amen because the word that that levite was ordained to minister was the same word that opened the red sea i mean phil fed the israelites in the wilderness amen that they you know their clothes were out their shoes didn't wear out amen fed them amen gave them spiritual revelation amen part of the jordan brought down jericho brought them victory after victory supernaturally that was the word amen that this levite should have been ministering but instead of that he was ministering a family idol he was ministering a bunch of idols in a house amen that were just dead you know complexes are dead i mean family spirits are dead they have no value in them i mean to hold on to a spirit of bitterness it'll just kill you let's be honest i mean it's not going to give you victory it's not going to give you joy in a spirit of depression i've never seen a happy depressed person i mean they've always been depressed and has it helped them not know but it's an evil spirit warding them off from the promises of god i mean when the scripture says whatever things are good and honest and lovely and a good report think on those things but a spirit of your pressure always make it look at the negative and this person did this and brother so-and-so didn't do this and sister so-and-so did this and ignored this and this is what happened here and pour me and look at the state i'm in but this but the word says amen godliness with contentment is great gain amen and whatever state we're currently in the bible says this is the will of god concerning you and i i mean so we should be believing if we're the bride of christ in our footsteps are ordered of the lord that a good day is a good day because it's god's ordained day amen it doesn't matter see we aren't christians because everything goes well we're not message believers because life is a bunch of roses and god you know god never promised us a flowery bed of ease i mean but he promised us a battle he promised us a campaign he promised us a victory i mean he promised us a war that's what he promised us amen we're not here for a sunday school picnic we're here for a battle but many thousands of battles are within right it's not always the external oh the world's doing this and who cares about what the world's doing i mean god has allowed the world to do what it does it says in the book of revelations that he put his god put it in the hearts of people to fulfill his word and these are people who have no idea about him they don't care about him whatsoever they're doing what they think they should be doing but god put it in their hearts to fulfill his will so this whole world you see is actually man fulfilling the will of god whether they're aware of it or not this whole world so don't get stressed about it i mean lift up your head and know your redemption is during night hallelujah there's got to be a pressure you take israel in egypt they were living in the best part of land they're living in goshen well-watered part of the land i mean do you think they would pack up there and go to the promised land that and you know they had to invade and and and cast out the enemies before them and fight a campaign they wouldn't have done that in their own ability i mean i mean they wouldn't have done that in their own desire because they had a nice place to live that's why god had to put a pressure on them where they had to realize hey we can't stay here anymore we cannot stay as slaves anymore we're not ordained to be in this position we must leave then they called upon the name of the lord amen and god heard heard their cry and delivered them and that's to see and that's the same thing with us you know we cannot be content with soft living brother braham says in one place it's a curse soft living is actually a curse right so we we can't just be content because this world wants to dull us to sleep it wants to distract us look at this listen to this this person said this and this politician is doing this and this sportsman did this and this person's doing this and this is the code and this is the blah blah and you know who cares about the blah blah blah it's just blah blah blah it's not going to get us in a rapture you think talking negative doesn't build your faith but what is it you're ministering to an idol you're ministering through an idol oh great spirit of lust or great spirit of depression oh a great spirit of anxiety you call upon it like it's some great big thing and you wonder why we have no victory it's because who are you calling on right have you said lord these not a bunch of filthy nonsense and kick it out my door i want you to be the cameraman amen but you see the problem is now people use the message as a lucky rabbit's foot i have a picture of it somewhere i'll come back to this and we'll come back to that now who can see the rabbit's feet oliver people believed people believed it was lucky to have a rabbit's foot and it's just a tradition from actually pretty much a big big part of the world now in some parts of the world this tradition came from something called the hand of glory and that hand of glory was actually what they'd do as someone who had been hung or executed they would take their left hand they would cut it off they'd preserve it and they would have that now this is you say well that's crazy why would have a dead man's criminal's hand you know as as as some kind of lucky token that's crazy well this is crazy too having rabbit's feet and it's crazy to have the message as a lucky rabbit's foot now what i mean by that it's just something in the background that if you need him you know oh i'll call upon him i'll rub him you know oh lord a great god of power come help me but you know our lives still go on the same way we still do what we want to do and you know we still you know we don't want god to rearrange our hearts and take away things and you know it's just like you know some now listen i believe in listening to the message when i drive to work i have the tapes playing right if i'm at work and i don't need to concentrate too much i'm listening right so i believe it you know i believe we should do that we should listen to the bible we should read the bible we should read the message we should listen to it but we can't let it just become background noise that it doesn't affect our lives now if you want to play it in the background that's perfectly fine praise the lord for that but i trust it's impacting you all right i trust that's changing your trust is anchoring into your spirit right it's not just you know noise that is just in the background at all but i'm playing the message you know i'm i'm pushing play i'm you know no that's just an idol if i can say it that way because it's just a rabbit's foot that's just in the background like some kind of buffer world are the words playing no but what's it doing to you well it's impacting your life is it transforming you i mean because this word has transforming power brother brown preached two services and they basically called the power god's power to transform and you know god's transforming power something like that he says this word has come as brotherhood was said to be transformed back to what we're meant to be in the beginning this is what this message has come it's full of transforming power to take a crippled up bunch of people in darkness and transform them amen that they would become the sons and daughters of god so is everyone following me this message be a lucky rabbit's foot to you don't diminish the word of god to be some crutch no it should be our all in all amen our very life amen it should be the very center of our lives not something on the periphery that like a hobby that you pick up from time to time and all the weather's good so you know i'll go do this you know that don't put it in that bracket it should be the center of your life amen let's go back where are we oh yeah we'll come to there yeah so he's got this priest now now i'm going to show you how idols are spirits and there came a certain of the elders of israel into me and sat before me now to me this is astounding just just what i've gotten yellow but let's read author and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man these men have set up their idols and their heart and put a stumbling block of their iniquity before their face should i be inquired at um of at all by them therefore speak unto them and say to them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through the idols now just just let's just look at that yellow i the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols so what the idol is i'll answer according to that so for example there's an idol where predestination goes to the extreme if you're gonna make it you'll make it if not you're not or if i can put it this way brother brown said everyone who you ever loved or loves you is going to be there come on you know honey just say you love brother brown and you'll be there oh no but my kids love me and i love them so they have to be there hold on that's an idol yeah amen you've got to believe on the lord jesus christ for thy house and they shall be saved that's right amen it's more than just saying well they love me and i love them just some kind of human love that goes back and forth it's more than that amen but it can become an idol where where they're idols in the person's heart and when they listen to the word they're listening through that pile and all they can do is rejoice and praise the lord we're all going to be there and somehow god's going to flip the switch and you know you know my family is going to be saved you know on their death bed or just before the rapture you know brother ram says god doesn't just flick the switch and change the spirit in you just before you die that's right you've got to make a decision and give your life now right that's why we're believing for our families we're actively i trust you're actively believing yes sir hallelujah now you do not look at the things that are seen be looking to the promise of god amen or what's another idol people have well you can just go through the message there's plenty i mean message community if i put it that way return ministry oh hey brother brown's going to come back and preach again you know we're all looking for a big revival when the prophet comes back no that's not going to happen because the lord jesus christ the one he introduced is here i mean the bride's revival is a recognition supernatural revelation that the bridegroom himself his spirit is upon the earth uniting himself with a people hallelujah where we realize who we are in christ we see it in heavenly places right now hallelujah amen having dominion and power over every work of the devil and the devil himself hello when we recognize who we are then the rapture will go amen but it can become an idol or an idol can be you know just push play we we don't need to go to church anymore amen the prophet never threw the five-fold ministry out the five-fold ministry is still here ephesians 4 is still an effect right until the body until the body's changed amen but it can become an idol you know people just ah you know because brother graham said you know the that you know the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost is to receive the word in your day and people say i've received the word but their lives haven't been transformed it's just a myth but but it can become an idol people just hear those things oh i've received the word have you received the word and they say it like a creed yes i've received the word i believe brother brown is a prophet of the age and revelations 10 has been fulfilled and here we are and you know it can just become a saying but we're not here to just live through a bunch of creeds because that's a creed a creed is just a recited list of words basically yeah a profession of faith with no life behind it but it can become an idol but that's what people hear praise the lord you know you know because why because god answers them according to their idol i pray lord jesus may we have no idols that when the word comes forth when you read the scripture when you hear the message when you're in church when you hear preaching that it's not through some kind of filter of an idol but it's the holy ghost it just ministers this whole word i mean whatever he has for me lord i want to i want to take it that way i don't want to have some idol that you answered me through that and there's many more but i just want to use those as some examples everyone following me to answer us according to the multitude of our idols amen we want him to speak to us according to his word what we have need of amen make us balance more make us balanced hallelujah sighing and crying for the abominations done in the city but yet full of joy unspeakable full of glory because we have eternal life and we're going in a rapture amen we should be i mean burden for lost souls but so thankful we're in amen that's how we should i mean believing actively believing i mean that god is gonna save hallelujah living a testimony i mean that people will see that we're salty say lord come live with me lord jesus have your way in my life every day i mean the people will see jesus amen now an idol so so so the bottom line an idol is anything we put before god in our heart it could be a job a person activity an idea a thing or even ourselves that means i found that picture there's a man bowing down those are all the idols in his heart there's many they're going to be many i pray oh lord jesus cleanse it all out lord jesus and just made only be you right you're following me we don't want the lord to answer according to those kind of idols we want him to come and speak now it says now we know this that in the last days perilous times shall come who believes her in the last days hallelujah it's going to be perilous times for men shall be lovers of their own selves so they'll love themselves covetous boasts proud blasphemous disobedient appearance unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despise of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead silly women um and leave sorry lead captive silly woman later with sins led away with diverse lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth what is that that is a whole big list of idols if i can just put it that way real simply to love yourself why your idol is yourself covetous i want this i want that i want that that's now another idol boasters it's pride and blasphemous disobedient to parents all those things is an idol amen that needs to be smashed down because this is the condition of the last days i'll say friends without the holy ghost we'll be caught up in this anointing we don't want to be caught up in this kind of anointing we want to be caught up in the lord jesus christ amen amen amen amen who has delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence and all things he might be number one so we read there and judges says well there's no king in that day well actually there was a king in that day which still was jehovah god he was their king amen but they are looking for a physical natural king but they already had a king remember when they when they wanted saul to be a king or when when they asked samuel rather to have a king samuel was very displeased about it but they said to samuel samuel they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me why because they want an earthly king instead of a spiritual king god is our king right he's not just our savior he's to be our king he wants to have preeminence that he might come live through a people again amen he said it's not for you to know the times or seasons that the uh what the father has put in his own mind but you shall receive power acts one you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power after you be made a bishop after you've been made a preacher after you've been made a pope after you made a priest no you shall receive power after holy ghost has come on you that's the witness that god was looking for a witness after the holy ghost is come not a witness that i'm a bishop i'm a witness that i'm a pastor but a witness of what of the resurrected king that's the true church the living god all right who is the head of the church jesus christ what kingdom is it the messianic kingdom the church not an organization a church a mystic body to which christ is the head and oh oh i love that walking in the spirit obeying the king foolish to the world precious in the sight of god walking in the spirit misunderstood laughter made fun of all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions if they are persecuted they persecuted the prophets which were before you call um called the lord of the building bells above how much more will they call them of his disciples but you're walking in the spirit turning your back to the things of the world not bound by any fetus he who the son has made free is free indeed amen that's the church of the living god thanks who set it up now we see in acts one and eight you shall be he said you shall be my witnesses after the holy ghost has come on you what is the church the mystic body of christ who set it up the lord jesus himself it wasn't set up at rome neither was it set up in england by john wesley neither was set up by calvin or in america the baptist or john smith neither was it set up in california by the pentecostals it was set up by jesus christ the king of the messianic kingdom and who is it set up by he is the king he wants to be king he wants to rule us he wants to be lord don't use them as a lucky rabbit's foot may he be your lord and savior not just your savior that's like a rabbit's foot oh when i need him i'll call upon no he's got to be both amen now i just want to just come here if if the message if if the lord himself has been received by us he gives the power to become the sons of god if it's if he's just a lucky rabbit's foot there's no power in the life there can be a lot more a lot of outward conformity to to the message or you know to i'll put it that way the message kind of you know the your bible way of doing things but what about the transformation of a character a transformation of a soul amen that we're not just religious people but god himself has come in see this is how we actually oh you know this is how we know if you've really received him or not that last verse but as many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name so that's how really that's how you know if you've really received him if you receive them up here there's no power being given to become a son of god so actually to be calm what you're ordained what you should be we just be a religious person everyone following me does that make sense because you should be able to look back in your life and say well i've gone from glory to glory right the things i once battled i don't battle no more because the lord has overcome them in my life his my character is more like his character remember when joshua and the children of israel when they crossed the jordan they didn't sit there they didn't sit at gilgal they went and possessed the land right they possessed so every complex every family spirit every you know everything that's been passed down to you by your family tree by the new birth what happens you conquer those things amen amen amen trauma of your childhood that gets conquered right the spirit that comes in through trauma he maybe had a breakdown maybe there was your unforgiveness maybe something happened in the family maybe you've got that trait that you can't forgive you can't let go you know you're depressed or whatever it is those things in the family gets passed down to you by the new birth those things get broken remember the message did not come to teach us how to live with our devils right it did not come to make us just our flesh conform to a religious idea no when he comes in this becomes subject to the word of god in our lives who's with me amen amen overcomer is actually they actually overcome right they actually wrestle with something and overcome it and then they they walk out packing the victory hallelujah they don't just walk in and live with a stalemate no no we're not called to live and stalemate i mean because he's received him to them gave you power to become the sons of god amen not slaves but sons join ears with christ seated in heavenly places in christ jesus what's that you have dominion over the devil you have dominion over this flesh you have dominion over your past you have dominion even over your present i mean so should never be i'm stuck in this and this is going on and everything's wrong no everything's right hallelujah everything's right amen but it depends if you've got idols in your heart you'll look at everything's wrong and poor me and woe is me no lift up your head your redemption is drawing mine amen hallelujah amen we'll go a bit further now notice they were not just to come together and talk about the message they were to get into it to get under the blood not just come and say you know moses told us the messenger he said he told us what we should that we should have blood what do you think about it boys that wasn't it get the lamb killed and get the blood up there you we can come and sit and agree with the word and everything else but that don't have that token see it's very good you know people get such big complexes that people have to receive all the mysteries of the word and when someone comes in and agrees with them i think praise the lord they've got the holy ghost no they can just be agreeing with the word we can't just get people to mentally acknowledge doctrine are you following me the life of god must come into us i mean to manifest the power in that doctrine amen revelations 10 has been fulfilled when you know the mighty angels come down the prophet received the open word he gave it to us we're eating it lord we're you know you know and we're prophesying again that should actually be living out amen right i mean when the prophet's on sunset mountain the seven angels came to him the sword was placed in his hand he went back to jeffersonville he preached the opening of the seven seals the lamb opened the seals and revealed it to him right it actually happened amen so now if we have become one with that open word where christ and i become one it's not just acknowledging that god sent a prophet or the seven seals are open it's not that it's that same word comes into you and i and manifest itself that's how it's got to be so it's not just to gather around and talk about the message hey it's good to talk about the message i'm not no don't ever get in your head that i'm against fellowshipping and talking about the word no we should talk about him he's lovely isn't he wonderful he saved us from the home name and he saved us from hell hallelujah he's going to take us on a rapture he's coming back for me he's worth a little longer that's the biggest understatement of a lifetime but you know so it's not just to talk sit down and agree with the word and everything else but that don't have that token what good does it do us no good get beneath it so what in other words let him become your lord let him change your life amen he was not responsible for anyone from under that blood and he is not responsible for anybody today out from under the token and the holy ghost is our identification that identifies us as christians not our membership in churches not our understanding of the bible not how much you know about the bible it's how much you know about the authorsy how much the author is living in you it's you're you're on you're no more you reckon yourself dead and the token is what lives in you it's not it's not your life it's him paul said the life that i now live he lived a different life from what he once did it is not me but christ liveth in me there is my token that god required identified with our identification with our sacrifice the life of our savior in us the holy spirit amen that's the way god sees you it ain't what you see your own self it's the way god sees you no man sees himself wrong i mean micro look within the scripture he saw himself right that levite saw himself right but if they looked in god's mirror of his word they would have seen that they were deadly wrong when you look in the mirror of god's word it tells you whether you're wrong or not if david would have done that he would have seen his wrong now this is uh will come into this if ahab had done that or their prophets would have done that they would have seen themselves wrong a vindicated prophet said ahab will die and the dogs will lick his blood and his prophecy was exactly worth it then he knowed he was right even jehoshaphat should have seen that and noted when mikaya saw the vision he he wasn't much with the people in them days but he had thus saith the lord he was right see we have to this is a segway but what you see around you is a fulfillment of what the prophet told us would happen micaiah had a had the word of the lord and he the word of lord hebrew had was from elijah that said that the dogs will look jezebel's blood amen is going to look ahab's blood and all those things are going to happen so he could see that this battle that that the kings have been drawn out to was actually a fulfillment of elijah's prophecy amen and this world we see today of the prophet's prophecy so worried about it amen because he also saw the preview of the bride hallelujah so explore us in preview not just the alpha bride in the beginning amen but the omega bright at the end walking instead amen to the word arrayed in his righteousness amen finally hallelujah so now so what are our lives to be i believe i'm part of that number right you've got to believe right i mean so now if my life if i'm part of that number then my life is going to fulfill that vision while walking in step with the word and go up hallelujah amen so everything's working man here's a picture that's just the pictures this is david now and they're taking the ark back to well he's going to take it back to his city and but he has the arc on a new cart who knows the story and they're done playing music and they're all excited and you know david's very excited because the word of the art is coming to his city and but then there's i think it's uh usa or uriah sorry if i get the name wrong you know the oxen stumble and then he goes to steady the ark and god kills him and this is the man on the ground here maybe david's the one in the red on the other side with his hands right he's saying oh what's going on sorry you know but the thing is see david assumed he was doing the right thing and though even though he is a man after god's own heart and no you know but he wasn't doing it according to god's word and god is not a respecter of persons you know if we go back to the story originally where it says that you know uh micah says to the levite you'll be a father and priest to us so our father basically now he's in charge right his word goes but then it says that micah treated this levite as one of his sons so now there's a human family pressure comes in right to make this levite maybe maybe he was shocked when he saw the house full of idols at first but then he began to reason but you know this guy's good to me he feeds me clothes me he treats me as one of his family so what happens a compromise comes in you know we can't compromise the scripture we can't compromise the message based on any person amen respective persons is sin what their last name is who they are how long they've been in the message for our human pressure to come in to compromise our work amen so we're going to stick you know we're going to stick with the word oh yes amen help us lord jesus amen but this your spirit of truth i mean to stick you know lukewarm if you look at the just webster or you know whatever dictionary part of that definition of being lukewarm is lacking conviction we don't want to lack conviction in this hour this is an hour where we need conviction we need real conviction amen we need to be convinced and then concerned hallelujah that's how we should be amen put our faith into action put our conviction into action amen we've got to stay something so he says hey this is wrong this has got to be stopped yup okay now where are we now my brother he says don't you miss this now when he says that i don't want to miss this and my sisters you who want to be woman preachers and so forth don't you miss this no matter how much your anointing is you've got to get in god's provided position david's anointing was all right but in doing it he got enthused and stepped over the boundary line what did he do he stepped over the boundary line instead of putting the ark in its original position he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the levites it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the levites which is over the heart the word is not defined it's in the heart not on a new cart i mean saying it's not just denominational ideas that are a new cat it can just be if the word's only in your mind a hallelujah that's not how it should be it should be in our hearts see what was it represented something new david did there spoke of every denomination that ever be god's word is not to be carried by state prep uh presbyters or bishops and so forth of denominations it's the baptism of the holy ghost in the heart of man and not in some ecclesiastical move the holy spirit is a treasure of god's love in the heart of man and woman to obey so an order see the word the word is not meant to be carried just on uh phone to push play and think i'm listening to the message therefore i'm okay no that message is to be carried in your heart right this message amen it was ordained to be carried out and you can't of just having it in the background somewhere and not making an effect in your life amen you look you say lord no we have to take inventory sometimes it's good to take stock right and actually be sincere before the lord say lord is the word i'm hearing is it making an effect in my life right right that's how it should be lord is it drawing me closer to you or is it taking me down some other trail where actually i don't love my brother or sister i can't overlook their mistakes i mean it's all about me right it's all about the past hurts and past trouble or you know there's something new fat you know who cares about fads i'll say it like this this vaccine stuff is a fan yeah hallelujah talk about conspiracy no conspiracy don't get caught up on that stuff amen amen amen i'm just gonna leave it like that but people get so caught up in so many different things and the problem is there's so many voices in this day what voice do we live in you know the voice that you're listening to will attract your attention to it if it's church politics you'll be attracted to that amen if it's world politics you're attracted to that and you'll begin to embody what you're attracted to amen if you if you're attracted to the word of god by the voice of god then you'll become the word of god amen and that's what we want to be we want to be bible living christians right we want this message not just to be on phones or mp3 or table whatever whatever format it is i mean it was never intended just to sit there and be talked about it was intended that it would come into the life i mean by the baptism of the holy ghost transform the believer into the image of christ i mean to manifest the bible that's what the message is meant to do now i'm going to finish with this he says let the power of jesus christ break tonight and separate every person in here from from any unbelief and that the presence of jesus christ the word who knows the thoughts of our heart that it take pre-eminence tonight in every heart and i'll say i mean let the power of god break this morning and separate every person here from any unbelief so from any idols i mean from any past hurts or pains or complexes spirits of depression or oppression lust or whatever it may be unforgiven envy strife anything of the world may the power of god break us from those things just come into our lives and just destroy those shells of those idols i mean that those complexes pains and hurts they don't have permanence over us i mean and also may he break our thinking i mean that we don't just cover up things because oh we're doing some part of the words the lord has to bless you amen reasoning is such an enemy to faith it is so much reasoning is such an enemy effect amen because if we read oh but i have the message in the background i have the bible in the background i've got quotes and scriptures on my you know on my wall so therefore you know my lifestyle is fine no that's reasoning right are we living a life that's pleasing to the lord amen and if we're not then we should pray earnestly lord break these spirits out of my life break these titles kill it dead lord that women right we don't have to live with them amen our god is very good in the business of destroying the works of the devil that's why it was manifest it would destroy the works of the devil amen so i pray amen that let the spirit of jesus christ enter into your heart i mean really receive him and separate you amen from any unbelief and let the presence of jesus christ the word who knows the thoughts of our hearts let it have preeminence this morning in every heart amen amen amen so let's just bow here to the word of prayer i just i just want to ask you sincerely are you like that man micah who had a house of house of idols do you hold on to things that you should not be holding on to it really just makes a decision you got to make a clear-cut decision lord i don't want to hold on to those things anymore i want to be free amen i want to be free remember the lord jesus is here to free us from all complexes from all hurts from all pain from all situations i mean we're we're not victims of circumstance hallelujah we are only a victim of the circumstance of the blood of jesus christ amen if you want to be remembered in prayer raise your hands to the lord amen god sees your hands god sees your heart i mean we're going to pray and then i'm going to turn the service back over to brother isaac amen let's pray gracious heavenly father lord we just want to thank you lord that we can come to you lord jesus and we are not here lord to go through a religious motion lord we're not here to add another idol to the shelf lord jesus we're not here to lord to take them from the shelf and dust them and shine them and put them in a higher place of preeminence of maybe or something from our past or lord some herd or complex or depress some spirit of depression or lust or whatever it may be lord jesus we're not here to keep those idols in our lives we are certainly not here oh god to try and cover it up with some quotes and some scriptures to try and justify our current state we're not here to do that my god father see every hand that's raised lord you see every heart lord jesus i pray in the name of jesus christ lord as they raise their hands and their hearts to you lord because they have a sincere desire lord that we would not be full of idols lord jesus we would just be full of the holy ghost oh god that maybe things passed down from our family lines lord jesus we know that lord that we can't change the past but lord we can let you change how to fix our future so my god i pray in the name of jesus christ may you silence that lying spirit that says that we can never be free we can never overcome this we can never break this uncle i pray our god that we curse it in the name of jesus christ because that is the spirit of liberty that's not your holy ghost lord you said whom the son is set free is free indeed so father i believe you're here now lord you're here to set the captives free lord your head is restore sight to the blind o god lord that we can look into the mirror of god's word of your word and say lord how do we tally up oh god lord jesus father we can come to you and say lord break every chain break every theater oh god change our lives lord i pray you'd forgive us of our sins forgive us lord jesus if we have used the message as a lucky rabbit's foot we've just had it as background noise but we haven't allowed it to change our lives lord as we read as many as received you you gave power to become the sons of god to become the sons of god to be transformed oh god lord jesus christ from a sinner to saint lord from lost to found lord from one who's overcome by the world and selves and trouble to overcoming amen god i want to commit everyone into your hands lord i pray take this message lord
