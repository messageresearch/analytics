to have everyone here and it's great to have more than just young people here praise the lord amen shows that you know we love the young people but we're all one body aren't we one family pulling together amen so we're just going to read the scripture we're going to go to micah and we're going to go to uh chapter seven and i'm going to read verse i'm gonna read seven and eight from micah seven bit of a um one of the what we call the minor prophets in uh in the old testament i'm just going to read these two verses then we'll open in prayer says therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me rejoice not against me o my enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be light be a light unto me amen let's bow heads in the word of prayer this afternoon gracious lord jesus we so glad lord your name is above all names lord what a powerful name it is thank you dear god that lord hell's got to get out of that way lord lord out of the way of your name lord everything must give way to the name of jesus christ even our bitterest enemy lord the devil has to give way to that name amen i want to thank you for that dear god sort of pray fathers we have this uh youth services it's called lord i pray you just take over once again may you bless speaker and hear our lord we just want to commit our lives into your hands we thank you for this time in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you may have your seats um i'm really thankful for what the lord is doing in our midst i'm very thankful for what god is doing uh we're we have a multi-generational fellowship praise god praise god it's not just the old people pulling and the it's the everyone's pulling together the young people pulling everyone is together you know everyone's everyone's on the front line they got their weapon in their hand and they're firing with everything within them pushing together as a body and because there has to come a time where it's not just the older or the parents oh yes i don't i don't like to put myself in any kind of bracket i'm a young person um but you know don't put me in a box um but you know there comes a time when where where we read here in micah where it's in a way it's like as if if mike is looking for a future event therefore i'll look upon the lord i'll wait for god for the god of my salvation he will hear me and i could say really we could i don't want to add or take away from the scripture but we can actually look and we can say no he has heard me yeah you know it's not a future event that he'll hear me or i will wait for him he's already come upon the scene we've called jesus on the scene he stepped out of history and he's doing a work and we can we can say you know not that uh i will i shall arise but a people have risen there's a people i'm looking at and it doesn't matter what age you are you've risen the lord is lighted upon you you know we live in a time of great darkness great confusion there's people pulling all different ways many opinions ideas and you know all around but it's all darkness but god has shown a light in this day and if we can if we can tap into that light which is the revealed word of the hour there's it is unlimited what god can do we can look down through history like you can take even you know a lot of the great revivals of the past were actually young people it wasn't the older generations it was the young yeah um you could even take you could even think about when jesus came upon the earth john was 30 and then jesus was 30 when they entered their ministry they would have been counted as young people you know they weren't they weren't in their 50s 60s they were young people the welsh revival that brought under over a hundred thousand souls was young people in wales crying out this is i think 1904 around there there was a great cry a great stir but it was the young people that god allowed to use as a channel i mean to bring that revival and i think god does that because he wants to show the older generations don't get stayed in your ways you know i'm the same yesterday today and forever don't just get set in your ways but let god work and um and and we can we can look even here where god has has has brought us young fellas in praise the lord but it's a tremendous thing because it takes the lord to shine his light upon a soul and it's a supernatural eternal work where we've been ordained for this hour you know we're here for this this is the reason we're here not just i'm not talking about just sitting in church but i'm saying to be a light to this dying world where where um we would read uh maybe we won't read it but to save time because i've kind of set myself 15 minutes but you know in in the book of revelation john saw the lord the resurrected lord jesus with seven stars in his right hand right yeah and and and those stars it says today the angels to the churches an angel means a messenger we know that angel angelic beings do not preach the gospel it's man that preaches the gospel you know like when cornelius was praying in acts chapter 10 and and you're an angel appears to him says you know your arms and your prayers will come before god you know it wasn't now the angel didn't say now i'm going to preach to you you know the gospel he says go get peter he'll preach it to you you know so god always uses man so those stars are ministries or men in the right hand of god predestinated ones and they've been released down through the ages now down everyone who caught the light that was reflected off that star illuminated their age as well it wasn't just a great ministry that that illuminated the age of the gospel with the power of god it was everyone in the church so the apostle paul was the first one you know the light of god shone upon him on the road to damascus he became the start of the age he wasn't his own light he was bringing he said i didn't get this from man it was by revelation of jesus christ and most of the new testament was through him so it wasn't his own ideas it was actually god revealing himself through the apostle paul but then there are other people under him like timothy where timothy was told let no one despise your youth you know we should be able to look beyond age right we should be able to look beyond age and a mount of grey or no grey or here or no here whatever you know actually discern the gift within one another because we're all part of the body now we're all we're all one big family right we're all one part of the body and we all need each other right we're all a vital part of this final move of god among the gentiles we're vital you may think i have no significance you're very significant yes you know it's like a you know you may be work behind the scenes organizing things it's very important you let those people go the place will fall apart you know you need the you need the prayer worries in the back you may be not saying anything they are the most vital force so everyone everyone either up front or in the back or in the in the pew creating an atmosphere for god to come down it's it's vital oh my lord it's very very important so so down through the ages there's been seven stars we know the last star has been brother brown's ministry where it wasn't just you know you know so now christ was revealed through that style now this is we live in a dark age but god used used that ministry to reflect himself to the earth and those who caught who actually tapped into that sunlight that was reflected off him of the gospel they became illuminated and we know in this age as an age of restoration and liberty this is what this age is about this is not an age of going down to dark ages this is a full restoration of truth full restoration of power where what we read who likes to read bible stories he likes your bible stories who likes to see yourself in the bible story amen amen so you can see like you can see peter in the jail and the angel comes down and sets them free or you know david killing goliath or you know hannah going before the tabernacle of the wilderness and praying for a son and god gives her a prophet and revival breaks out in israel or you know like the prayer meeting there and um you know you know there and i think it was rhodes no no it wasn't rhoda's house but she was a servant girl that came to the door when peter got let out of the prison you know like you can see yourself i trust you can see yourself in those stories amen and because the reason god wants you to see yourself in this because that same kind of life will be living through you you may not be killing lions and beers and giants but there's spiritual there's this demon spirits to be to be down you know and and but there's prayer meanings to have for god to live so you know so he reflects himself so god reflects himself down into us and then we illuminate the age by his holy ghost and now that gives us light so when whenever he gives us light like that when the when the word comes open like that to a person then they can say not i shall arise but i have arisen i did sit in darkness the darkness of my own mind just thinking well this is just how it's going to be and when i grow up i want to be this and you know caught up in just stuff but then their eyes come open and you say hey i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god you know i'm living in a time where a rapture is going to happen where a restoration is taking place and you know where where the devil's under my feet i don't have to pander to him but he's here to actually obey my voice amen so to me this is an incredible this is an incredible time here right here we are i think i think we have some of the finest young people in the world this is maybe i'm biased you know parents are biased i guess you know but the thing is the lord has gathered us for a purpose and it thrills my heart i know i've said it before but when you know the you know the older young people are having prayer meetings and god's answering prayer right god's answering prayer in there can we can someone say you know i'm not just making up stuff god's answering prayer and we've gotta just i just encourage you if you fall just get back up remember the devil doesn't want you to stay on the road he doesn't want you to keep serving god he's against you but god's for you right god's for you even if you fall god's for you even if you fail yourself willingly god's still for you you just gotta get up repent put it under the blood and walk on amen amen that's you know and but keep keep fighting the battle keep serving the lord now as i said that those who caught the light for their age illuminated the age but the thing is that word this word and i could hold the messenger to is our source of strength it's vital some people think oh you know all he says to us to do is pray and listen to the message and read the bible there's spiritual strength in that there's spiritual strength we're going to grow up the inner man it'll it'll help you in your walk even as even as young people in school i remember when i started high school i saw the year 13 so they called them now i thought man i'm never gonna get there it's like five years it's like forever away you know and i won't say how many years ago that was but i don't have enough fingers and toes maybe to count that but you know but the thing is don't you know just love the lord with all your heart amen you know love him with thanksgiving praise him even if you don't feel like it give him thanks and remember that we we have a vision we have a vision that vision is is to walk with the lord and take a rapture right that that's god's vision for us you know whatever job we get different things that's all part of it too but the main thing is we just walk with the lord and follow him and love him with all your heart just remember there's so much like we have a thirst in our in our life you could say it's you know you know but and that thirst will go on different things as you walk through life but make sure most of it's on the lord because because it's a natural desire to get married want to have a career different things right so there's a thirst for that but don't let all of your thirst go on those things keep your mind thirst on the lord and he'll guide you with those things right because remember we're not robots we're people and god knows we're people but as we walk with god you know there's going to be more giants that are going to come against us more spirits will come against us and the road isn't easy but the lord makes it possible and he makes it satisfying right hey you can look back on your trophy wall and say lord you won all these victories in my life isn't it satisfying we can look back say lord you stepped upon the scene and i pray that we will get a greater love for truth a greater love for it that you'll love i i trust you all fall in love with this amen amen you'll fall in love with this right the words in here are eternal i because i was thinking what could i say to us all if this was the last the last time i ever stand here i'd say fall in love with him fall in love with him and whatever happens in life if your life is fully surrendered to him it'll all work out for your good the moment may not seem good but it'll work out for your good and live a life that say lord as long as my life is pleasing unto thee then whatever you do with it that's fine you know it's amazing isaiah 53 maybe we'll just go there quickly and then i'll end i've got i've got two minutes isaiah 53 because if our lives are completely surrendered to god we cannot be actually disappointed in his leadership hallelujah you know we might be disappointed in the situation because we thought it would go a different way but praise the lord you know praise the lord that's all now i can i might just need to start reading here he says now this is from this we'll just start from verse one who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he has no form nor coming us that when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire and this is describing the lord jesus he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him up surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken a stricken smitten of god afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed now i trust this whole chapter becomes like daily food because this is god's covenant with you amen we are all like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way the lord has laid on him the the iniquity of us all he was oppressed oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter as the sheep before his shearers is done he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation if he was cut off for the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was he any deceit in his mouth now this is the this is the first one to get to verse 10 he says and i'll and i'll and i'll finish with this and christy and i were talking about this a while ago yet it pleased the lord to bruise him so it actually was pleasing to god to bruise the messiah it pleased him and because the lord was the lamb of god whatever the lord had whatever you say the father had for him he was willing to take not my will but thy will be done amen and so i pray that we're all in our hearts would have a life that would say lord as whatever is pleasing to you may it happen in my life and that doesn't mean all the great stuff that we think is great if it's pr it's pleasing that i'd be bruised for my friends for my family for others amen i trust we'd have that kind of a heart hallelujah lord mate i want to live a life that's pleasing to you because the lord has lighted upon us and we have arisen amen we're not a natural people we're a supernatural people serving a supernatural god who does is doing supernatural things so i'm going to finish there we're going to have david come forward so i promise i'd be short because we're not here to listen to me but i thank god for the young i thank god for all of you i'm gonna say the young people but here you are i thank god for all of you just keep the fire burning and you are all important you're all a vital part of this and you're part of this family of god amen amen so let's just bow our heads and then we'll pray and then and then david you want to you want to come up after that okay let's pray lord jesus just pray to god may we just be fully surrendered into your hands lord just like uh you are the days of your flesh where we just read the prophecy but yet it please the lord to bruise him lord jesus we want to live a life that's pleasing unto you dear god and we know we can't do that in our own strength we can't do it by our own resolve our own humanity or our own determination lord it takes you in us lord to live a life that pleases you so dear god may we be surrendered lord all that we know and have lord we want to surrender surrender into your hands our entire lives father i pray lord that you bless each one here lord thank you for these wonderful young people lord the lord the parents here as well dear god i i i do stand here in marvel and thank you so much for what you're doing lord you're raising up another generation lord that they're not the church of tomorrow they're the church of right now lords i pray you'd bless them and keep them and you strengthen them oh god keep them walking with you please may your grounded father it's only by your grace lord that we can walk with you my lord so i pray bless and touch each touch each one we thank you lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends brother david i'll turn it over to you amen god bless you bro [Applause] god bless everybody um this afternoon um i think we'll just stand this afternoon we'll just read a quick scripture i think we'll turn our bibles to um john john 4 24. i mean it says here god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth i mean you may have your seats i mean so i just want to talk i want to talk i want to talk about the um my sermon title um this afternoon is worship and that word worship means um to show reverence and adoration for a deity i mean so i want to talk about talk about a little bit about the spirit um so it says here and faith is a substance it says and then your inward man is the spirit which has two senses faith and unbelief amen and then i want to um speak here also in why i am a holy roller um but god accepted abel's offering because abel by faith offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain by being just amen amen i found that i found it quite powerful and i also like to go to um the angel of god it says here oh people rise in the name of your lord claim your god-given privilege for the hour is here for you to be healed that's right to glorify god and to receive of his spirit and his blessings amen amen so we're here too so we're here to receive receive of god's spirit amen this this afternoon i mean when we when we're in the spirit we must be in the spirit of christ yes amen oh that's right i mean i just want to turn to um first peter four and six sorry sorry first peter four looks first peter 4 and 6 it says for this cause was the gospel preached also to the embedded dead that they might be judged according to me in the flesh but live according to god and the spirit amen and if we could turn to first john 4 and 1 first one four and one it says behold believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world i mean so john saying that we must try the spirits because there's not you know not not all spirits are of god and if we could go to um galatians 5 and 22 galatians so galatians 5 and this 22 says but the fruit of the spirit is talking about it with the fruit of the spirit of christ the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith and 23. meekness temperance against such there is no law i mean so that those are the attributes of of christ those are those that's that's the fruit so um i want to go to experiences brother brandon talks about experiences it says there's talking about an evil spirit now this is what he's talking and there had been many spirits had went out of the people and got into others this one woman had went insane she was got her mind off the lord on some woman was talking to her sitting there she turned around while i was praying i was was talking to the woman and an insane spirit came upon her i had to leave the pool soul like that she's still insane i mean so it's an evil spirit so we want the the spirit of god this this afternoon amen want to be touched by christ so that's that's what he's when we when we're in his we must when we worship we must worship in god's spirit amen his spirit must flow freely through us and then we can enter into his blessed presence amen i want to turn to um uh john 14 6 john 14 6. amen and it says here i know i just want to talk i want to touch on um touch on truth now it says here jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so jesus is saying that he is he he's clearly states here i am the truth amen do we believe this morning so we say and we want to go to um 217 he he states again even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it saith him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen so jesus is clearly says that he is the truth and then if we go to john 17 17 says here sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth amen so god's word this this bible this is god's truth amen how powerful is that we can have the the the truth of god in our very in our very presence this afternoon amen and if i just want to go to another quote from brother branham uh this is um diseases and afflictions it says here and without faith it's impossible to please god and if you want to please him you must come to him with faith believing his word is truth amen you must believe his word is truth in order to please you almighty maker amen the god that created you amen oh hallelujah we we have the honor to please him amen so he must believe that his this this word is truth amen in order in order to please christ amen amen and us want to amen go to another quote from brother branham this one is in um israel is israel in the church and it says here when i was born in a little kentucky cabin up there the angel of the lord came in the window and stood there there was a pillar of fire and i said god has proved that and if i tell the truth god will vindicate the truth amen so god will have mitigated truth and we all know that um vindicate means to clear someone of blame or suspicion show or prove right reasonable or justified amen so god will will prove right the truth so we don't have to question they mean god god will god will show us that's right amen and i just want to want to start i have another quote here there's also israel in the church it says the lie that came that satan told eve was 90 truth 90 truth and the lie that you can tell how i've heard men bypass pieces in scripture just to keep from it hurts the theology see but if if if this part's right that part's right amen let's put it together and make it fit through the whole bible oh hallelujah when we're talking about truth truth is the fullness of god so in order to worship in spirit and in truth you must you must worship in god's spirit and in truth your whole life must must be be must live according to this word amen to god's truth and then we can worship amen we can enter into god and we can have a blessed time in his presence amen we cannot we cannot live our lives 90 percent if we live at 90 it's a lie amen we must live the full 100 percent in god and then and his full truth amen amen i just like to talk about the raising of hands and worship now that we can all worship amen let's talk about raising our hands in worship all right amen i just want to turn to psalms 134 verse two hey so psalms 134 versus two it says david i think amen who believes that david loved to worship and i believe david loved whispering so his he has a lot of psalms about worshiping god i mean it's quite it's it's a blessing to him he says here lift up your hands on the sanctuary and bless the lord i mean he's stating lift up your hands and then you know bless the lord amen amen and then if we could turn to psalms 28 verses 2 amen john 28 verse 2 it says hear this hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i lift my hands toward thy holy oracle again he's stating amen lifting up lifting up our hands amen and if we go to um nehemiah 8 and 6. nehemiah and 6 says and ezra bless the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshiped the lord with their faces to the ground amen again so we they are lifting up their hands in in worship if we go to um limitations limitations 2 and 19. let's get there 2 and 19 says arise cry out in the night and the beginning of the watchers pour out thine heart like water before the face of the lord said lift up by hands toward him for the life of my young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street i mean again lifting lifting up their hands i think that this was a this was a an absolute place they must have been imagining that presence lifting up your hands in such a a scary scary place and then if we go to go to exodus 17 and we'll read verses 9-11 i really like this one so if we go exodus it's nine and nine to eleven and it says here and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses and moses aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass moses held up his hand and israel prevailed amen so moses started winning when his hands were raised i mean how powerful is that i was searching the scriptures and i and i was thinking you know how am i gonna how am i gonna tell people you know to raise your hands in church but it says here and and um amen says here and when moses held up his hand israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amulek prevailed i mean so when worshipping we're winning when we're raising our hands i mean who believes that i mean that's so it's so that's that's what i was like i was like man what a powerful scripture i mean we we can we can win when we lift up our hands i mean so i just sort of be a good inspiration to people you know you come to church and you know you don't have to be down anymore you can lift up your hands and start winning amen we want to win oh hallelujah amen so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna leave that there but i trust i trust you guys all truly blessed we can win i mean [Applause] amen i like that worship in spirit and in truth raise up your hands and we win glory because we're here for total victory aren't we praise the lord amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen praise the lord hallelujah we're just going to do a quick swap with some microphones we have the musicians for please we're going to maybe um joshua leaders in the chorus thank you sir amen but praise the lord amen hallelujah i like that you know how how how brother david said you know we can't just be a 90 christian gonna be 100 christian the whole truth i mean let's just be all hallelujah amen praise the lord amen [Music] i mean let's stay let's just sing the chorus of what a wonderful name do you know amen praise the lord just as yeah brother ben comes to wrap it up amen what a wonderful name it is what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus christ [Music] what a wonderful day but it is the name of jesus god bless everybody well that was two great little sermons eh so apparently i've got to wrap it up somehow um just pray please heavenly father lord jesus lord i pray just

everyone here to you lord amen you guys made your seats thanks musicians yeah it's great to see the young life coming through isn't it all their own talent um i just titled my sermon having the mind of christ in god's economy it's actually a bit of a bible study too so i'm glad that i wasn't the only one thinking that so we're gonna i'm gonna start off with um acts chapter two one to four and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly came a sound from heaven as a mighty rushing wind that filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were filled with the holy ghost and they again to speak with other tongues as a spirit gave them utterance oh excuse me i just got to get my phone so i would like yeah i'm preaching a lot about the mind i think i'm going to try switch it to god's economy um yeah as a spirit it was the spirit of god in truth it gave the utterance but it was with they when the when the holy ghost fell they were in one mind and i searched up in the greek and that uh with one mind is to be with with one mind one accord with one passion they are all together they're in truth they're in one spirit they're all believing in jesus christ and they waited there for 40 days i think it was 500 invited and there was only 120 they were there they received and they waited until they got in one accord and that's when the holy ghost fell um so with wanaka we all need to be in one accord you know they like we can't have orts against each other like little things no no praise the lord if if someone's carnal we're just gonna we just gotta forgive them and move on in the situation we can't hold resentments in this day and age we're writing a new book of acts we're moving forward and we have to have the mind of christ in us i'd like to go to philippians 2 two to six i think fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain or glory but in loneliness of mine let each esteem other better than themselves let not every man look on on his own things but every man unto the things of others let this mind be in you that was also in jesus christ whom being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god it's a spirit of god that dwells within us when we've made new creations in christ it touched me quite a lot um when you think of the mind of christ in our minds he was so lowly though he came wrapped in maine born in a manger wrapped in spotting cloth like it's not very pleasant it was probably dirty and sweaty from the cows of the octopus shorts one it was but he was so that god that created everything that could have anything he wanted came so lowly to us to give us everything um and that was his mind as i preached about this i want to sort of just point out and through the scriptures how the lord's mind was um i would like to read a quote sorry i don't have any of this up there um from brother branham and disease and affliction is a bit wider when they've got this one um and i just read and it said and the sooner that our audience gets with one mind and one heart if the people if this group of people sitting here probably probably the ones that's to be prayed for tonight to come on the platform if they will be in one heart and one accord just in the next five minutes there won't be one of them in wheelchairs or costs if they'll believe that this is the truth the truth of the lord jesus christ with us dwelling in our souls when we're new creations believing not all maybe no believing and then as they come one by one tonight to the platform if they are each one not taken from those wheelchairs and cots and things and walk off this platform normal then you can say i'm wrong that night they all walked off the platform healed because the lord jesus was there with them that's his word um yeah really when when the scripture came i was like you know when he said be not robbery to be equal with god we're only equal with god through the blood of jesus christ through meekness and loneliness not thinking we you know being something it's it's being so humble to serve the lesser assembling them to be the better because that's what god did for each of us he gave his life he was bruised beaten whipped lived a life full of sorrow that i could have a nice tiny home a nice jug have a washing machine though he would have just washed his clothes real slow like that god did that for us um i'd like to jump across to philippians 4. four eight uh four yeah rejoice the lord always and again i say rejoice rejoice like a worship you're happy happy in the lord let all moderation be known unto all men that the lord is at hand be careful for nothing that in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep you shall keep your hearts and minds through jesus christ so there he's saying that he'll keep us through the minds of jesus christ so as kids as young ones we all have hobbies we all have what we want to do but the lord is clear saying here the lord will keep each one of you but we need to have our minds to jesus christ so we need to be thinking of how christ was and try and surrender and then the lord be like that through us in our lives finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good ah of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things so think positively with our minds we don't want to let negativity or oughts or anything that's ungodly come into our minds if we keep our minds on christ we will be moving forward with christ um i think it's the right time now to say uh all these quotes great arrivals us uh this is from um the children of israel great revivals are sweeping out across the country the people are one heart and one of mine they are just sending one to one another's church let the people go wherever church they wish to go let them have their own preferences and whatever a person believes go ahead and believe that but don't criticize the other man that's it let let's stay together and serve god hallelujah so yeah when i was writing this anytime there was a healing service or revival everybody got in one heart one mind one accord with the spirit of truth that's that's how it happened even in jesus day they they believed in the lord praise the lord i'm just going to move on to colossians now over the page three one to four i think if you then be risen seek those things which are above which christ sitteth with christ is on the right hand of god set your affections on things above not on things of the earth for ye for ye are dead and your life is hit with christ and god when christ who is uh our our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory the reason i'm bringing this forward is oh sorry there's caramel at all um so now i want to go down to nine lie not one to another seeing that you have put off this old man with his deeds 10. and he put on a new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him and we know god created us and why i brought this forward and why i wanted to say this is when we the lord wants our minds to be on him he's saying he'll lie not one to another the old man's been put off don't look back to the old man how the old man was look on what christ wants us to have crisis in the bible christ the whole bible tells us what the mind of christ was like from when jesus was born until when he was crucified he subjected and submitted himself to the will of god no matter how much pain it cost him no matter what where he went like he went to the time of the pharisee and he was humiliated but he in himself he probably would have known that because he would have known the character of simon and where simon come from but he had the mind of christ and he went and that was to us you know that was a role model people are going to make fun of us when we make our stand but that's right have the mind of christ and christ will be with us i want to move on to timothy timothy 1 6 to 7 i believe second timothy sorry i don't know how you go i don't know how you ministers do they say this is real nerve-wracking stuff six to 7 i believe i believe i'm in the right place now wherefore i put thee in remembrance that you steer stir up the gift of god which is in thee by putting on of my hands for god hath not given us a spirit of fear but this but of power and of love and of a sound mind in our minds the majority like god is love so our mind should dwell a lot on love it shouldn't dwell on fear and negativity that we don't want to put our minds onto what the devil has to offer because it's not our portion at all god's going to bring us through great things but if if we dwell on fear or negativity or what the devil will do to us we will never really overcome that because we dwell on the positives of god what has what he said what his promises to us are praise the lord um with the mind of christ i want to keep on moving forward and move to a a compassion part um i want to go to matthew 15 30 32 jesus in his mind here great compassion for people um so oh uh jesus here was um a whole lot of people come away and he was preaching to them and it says here and a great multitude came unto him having with him those that were lame blind dumb man and many others and were cast down at the feet of jesus and he healed them and so much at the multitude wondered where when they saw the dumb to speak the man to be whole and the lame to walk in the blind sea and they glorified the god of israel so that in their minds they knew that this was god those people that were healed they knew it was then jesus came and jesus called his disciples unto him and said i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now for three days and have nothing to eat and i will not send them away fasting at least they faint in the way so here god healed them and then he had compassion because they stayed and didn't want to go away and he wanted to feed them and hit compassion for them he didn't just not care for them he fed his children down here it says you know he has seven loaves and some fishes and he fed the multitude and there was still seven baskets left which is a great thing that he actually kid he cared to feed everybody not just a little bit they had leftovers and it's the same in our day too you know we don't just have a little bit of food brother branham gave us so much food like if you want to overcome and live overcoming life you can everything the prophet said you can walk into by faith and walk into this rapture we all have to get in one mind one accord and worship in the spirit of truth um just a comparison of the scripture mark 6 24. brother ben gave me this one just before mark 6 and 24 i think 34 sorry and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion towards him because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things this compassion i thought about that how he was moved to compassion for us to feed us and i think with our minds taking on the minds of christ being made new means with christ we should have compassion too for people when we see friends that are struggling or in the world you know doing worldly things they're hungry they go home forgive me if this is wrong or they drink and smoke and they're trying to fill a void of god because they're hungry and they don't have any rest and we should have compassion on them we should we should bring them before the lord with prayer and supplication of fasting and ask and try to win them in the spiritual world that god would open their eyes that they would see they would take a word and do season and take on the minor christ too and god would reveal himself to them i want to move forward to romans romans chapter 8 35 chapter romans 8 35 i'm not sure i'm not sure if i supposed to read this one first or ten but we'll do it for who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulations or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or prevail of the sword um and i was going to go to think ten times in with this ten verse one uh i know 10 verse heading for whoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved this is a promise and when it anchors in your mind that whoever calls upon the name of the lord will be saved that's god's promise to us and when i want to go back to x uh nah uh sorry sorry forgive me uh 8 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ like who shall who's going to come against us that's more powerful than god if we have the same mind of christ nothing will stand in front of us before us against us satan won't come into this church and break this church up with some little bickering or some gossip because we're going to be in one mind of one accord and if someone does that we're going to have the same line of christ and forgive them we're not going to wait until they come and go can you forgive us because the the lord's prayer said didn't go forgive them when they asked forgive and said forgive them and you shall be forgiven don't don't wait don't hold it just let it go because if someone does upset you it's only the devil trying to get them amongst us to cause assurance so the spirit of god can't move and that's we don't want it at all we want god to move powerfully in our lives and our families lives and we want to call on the name of the lord for our families for our loved ones for our friends and we can't let unforgiveness hold that and the mind of christ he teaches in this bible that we have to have the same amount of wonderful that he had he didn't like the one when when the people came to get jesus and crucify him one of the pharisees or roman soldiers cut off peter's ear he didn't go that was a very nice you know how do you do that to my disciple he picked up his ncaa peter we don't fight in this world like that we forgive them and we've got to be christ-like to them yeah and that was that was the money you know like if someone cut off my mates he'll be pretty i'll be pretty upset you know i'd struggle to pick it up and say hey don't do that you know remember the word forgive is the ears cut off you'd be pretty taking on the mind of christ it's a it's a life of surrender push forward it is well worth it the lord will bless you and keep you amen amen it's by faith we believe um now he's come i want to tie us into god's economy when we're made new creatures in christ we switch from working in satan's economy and we move into working into god's economy and in god's economy we work by faith we don't we don't it's not by our understanding we do or reasoning it's by the word of god that we do it um i have some scriptures but i just want to talk for a bit um when i came in you know i just came to wellington started working the lord provided i was in god's economy i believed by faith and i prayed i know i know there's a powerful teacher in the church and brothers are struggling they don't in business this is hard because when his home when you can't feed your children or pay your rent things are going downhill you don't stop paying your tithes you pay your tithes the lord will take hold of it satan's economy runs by money god's economy runs by love and we can never try to cross them over because if we try across out god's economy and rely on satan's economy things won't go well for us in our families or in our lives but believe in god and he will he'll he'll be your savior keep you out of trouble amen i want to go to first kings i want to tie us to the scripture so it's not just me speaking it um i was actually in new plymouth yesterday and this dude just came along started talking about this stuff and i was like and was the law would say i want you to switch this and you need a sermon it was very i was real powerful i could feel god there talking to me um so first king 17. i want to sort of type it to jezebel and ahab and elijah yeah first king 171-5 and elijah the tisha by who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as are the children out as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be jew or reign these three years but according to my word and the word of the lord came unto him saying get thee hints he get the hands and turn eastwood and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan and it's and it shall be that they shalt drink from the brooks that i have commanded the ravens to feed thee so he went and did according unto the word of the lord and he went and dwelt by the brook this is when um yeah i'm sure it's a familiar piece of scripture he called for a famine oh for no rain which no food will grow and the lord provided and we can tie it to this day and age you know you want to do something we need the lord to provide we need the lord to feed for us we're not we're not we're not trying to go about and do our own will we want the lord's will in our lives and the lord will feed us a word of due season or feed our families or feed our loved ones we rely on the lord so he called for this there'll be no rain and he went down to he went down to a woman just over the uh the widow woman and she had no oil left she was pretty much in a last feed and he just and the god had told him passive your 9 16. arise and get there too zaripath which belongeth to zidane and dwelleth there behold i've commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he rose and went to zara and when he went and cut to the gate of the city behold the witter woman was there gathering the sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water and a vessel that i might drink and as she was going to fetch it he called unto her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in my hand and he said and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in to go in and dress it for me and my son that we might eat and die and elijah said unto her fear not go and do it as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee my son so in this in this in the spout of no rain no food the lord fed his prophet the lord that prophet was running on his economy but he also sent down his prophet to someone in that time they had no food they weren't running in god's economy because they had no food but he said give me some food and then he said i think you go down these he got um they went and got all their pots and filled up with oil and they were sustained for a time so the prophet's measures came down in the age and gave us a whole lot of oil that we would feed on that would be running on god's economy and we can type that until today we're running on god's economy the brother branham has filled up all all the um tapes and we have a word in due season when we're struggling we're running on god's economy and it's not it's not a great mystery that we are when we pray we believe by faith this is god's economy running and we've got to just keep our minds on god's economy and not try running around doing all these things in the world because god has got each and every one of us young children a job where he wants us what he wants to say to people what he wants us to do so we just need to bear in mind that the lord has given us all the food stay in one mind and want to call with the spirit of god and let him lead you and everything will be good and we're going to rapture soon but there's there is things to do there is lost souls out there we need to be have prayer and supplication this new man has it needs to have the mind of christ and we need to really push forward because the battle is hot the devil's angry he will try to overcome and kill anybody anybody um with this with the um with this mind of god the scripture i had to conclude my sermon dave ready so we're gonna go there anyway the fruit of the spirit galatians 5 22. joshua but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against the sun against such there is no law the mind of christ this is the mind of christ having all these gifts opera in our life not having a hate mail or strife above here the mind of the devil you could say is idolatry witchcraft hatred variancy emulations wrath strife seed editions here see indians murders drunkenness revelings the lord in his bible has showed us how to have the mind of christ and he has firmly pointed out how not to have the mind of christ he's told us to do in the don'ts but there's love and compassion for us we just need to read the word ask the lord to come give us the same mind that he had and understand how he was because that's how he wants us to be and when we are lowly and meek and humble and have the gifts of the spirit operating in our lives people see there's something different about us when you give someone that you give something to somebody you only just have or just brought and they want it or and you bless somebody they see something different in you they see a real christian there's lots of fake christians in this world and people i meet people every day and they they're not real christians and other worldly people look at them and they they hate christianity and hate religions because of fake christians and the devil has tricked this world in such a way that they believe there's nothing to it i mean history points to it but it's because there's a religious spirit going around deceiving everybody in the mind the greatest battle is for in the mind before you ever go to do anything that you're ready the devil's either battled you in the mind and you've redecided what you're going to do so keep your mind on christ keep your affections on christ and the lord will lead you god bless you young children there's a work for you to do god will place you hey um yeah the mission has come [Applause] i would stand and sing a song and then yeah we'll get um brother jonah to come and close him
