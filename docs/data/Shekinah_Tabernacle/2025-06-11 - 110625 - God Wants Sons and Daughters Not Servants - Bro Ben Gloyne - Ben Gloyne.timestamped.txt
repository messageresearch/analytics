[1:02] God bless you, saints.
[1:05] I trust all happy to be in the house of
[1:06] the Lord tonight. I know it's a bit
[1:09] cold. It's winter now. It's raining.
[1:12] We're tired from work or school.
[1:14] I just hope that we came expecting to
[1:16] hear from the Lord tonight
[1:19] and that we'll be blessed and be
[1:20] revived.
[1:25] Let's just open in a word of prayer
[1:26] tonight.
[1:29] Our most gracious and most eternal
[1:31] heavenly father, I just want to come
[1:32] before your presence, oh Lord, today
[1:34] just thanking you for this opportunity
[1:36] that we can gather, that we can praise,
[1:39] Father God, and just worship your name.

[1:58] are not here and who weren't able to
[1:59] make it, they may also be blessed across
[2:02] the stream, oh Lord, that you may heal
[2:04] those who are unwell, oh God, and give
[2:05] them strength. And Father God, I just
[2:08] pray that everything may go according to

[21:09] Good evening, everyone. I'm sorry I'm
[21:12] not Jimmy. Brother Jimmy was meant to be
[21:13] here tonight, but he's working away, so
[21:16] you've got me instead. But we'll we'll
[21:18] roster him in some other time to make up
[21:20] for it. Amen. So, um yeah, God bless
[21:23] you. Um let's go to the scripture. Uh
[21:26] tonight, we're going to go to Galatians
[21:27] chapter 4 and just a couple of verses,
[21:31] verses 6 and 7.
[21:44] Amen. So, everyone's there.
[21:47] Everyone's still Everyone's not an
[21:49] icicle. Everyone's warm enough. Amen.
[21:53] Spiritually and naturally.
[21:58] Amen. So, Galatians 4 and 6 and 7 reads
[22:01] like this. And because we are sons, God
[22:06] hath sent forth the spirit of his son
[22:07] into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father,
[22:10] wherefore thou art no more a servant,
[22:12] but a son, and if a son, than an heir of
[22:15] God through Christ.
[22:17] What a powerful scripture right there.
[22:20] Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of
[22:22] prayer. If you want to be remembered,
[22:23] you slip your hand up. There's quite a
[22:24] few who are not here tonight because of
[22:25] sickness and remember them especially.
[22:28] But let's pray together. Who wants to
[22:29] who wants the Lord to speak to them
[22:30] tonight? Amen. He's a personal God. I'm
[22:33] so thankful he is. Lord Jesus, we are so
[22:35] glad. I'm so thankful, Lord, that you're
[22:37] a personal God. Father, we don't just
[22:39] know about you. We know you personally,
[22:42] Father. We want to thank you for that,
[22:43] Lord, this night. And Lord, as we've
[22:45] gathered this night, and we want to
[22:47] worship and praise you. We thank you for
[22:48] the songs we've sung. We thank you for
[22:50] the atmosphere. We just want to thank
[22:52] you for your presence, Lord. And I just
[22:53] want to ask as we go through your word
[22:56] tonight, may you anoint it to our
[22:57] hearts, Lord. May it live, Lord. I pray
[22:59] it would bring forth a hundfold in
[23:01] everyone's life. Lord, those who are
[23:03] streaming tonight, Lord, because of
[23:04] sickness or working or whatever it may
[23:06] be, Lord, I pray you'd be their abundant
[23:07] portion, Lord. May it be like they're on
[23:09] the front row, dear God. May they feel
[23:11] your presence so real. And Lord, may you
[23:13] take your word, anchor it into our souls
[23:14] for your glory. We love you, Lord. We
[23:16] ask you cover us in your blood, Lord.
[23:17] Those who are sick, may you heal them.
[23:19] Lord, I pray you'd pour your spirit out.
[23:21] Speak to our hearts in a special way
[23:22] tonight. Grant it, Father, in Jesus
[23:24] Christ's name. May you remove every
[23:26] stumbling block of the enemy and you may
[23:27] you have free course for your glory in
[23:29] Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. Amen.
[23:32] God bless you friends. You can have your
[23:33] seats tonight. So I want to speak on a
[23:36] small a small subject here about uh we
[23:40] are no longer servants we are sons. But
[23:44] I want to ask you the question are you a
[23:46] servant or a son? Because we all start
[23:48] off as a servant but we're sons. Okay.
[23:51] Okay. So I'm just going to go through I
[23:52] want to ask this question because both a
[23:55] son starts as a servant but doesn't stay
[23:57] a servant and both act differently. They
[24:00] can be working in the same place in the
[24:02] same church in the same area doing the
[24:05] same job but one will conduct themselves
[24:08] very differently from the other. Okay.
[24:09] So this is where I'm going to go
[24:10] tonight. It's just a question I want to
[24:12] you know I always think though winter
[24:13] nights. Let's pull up by the fire. Let's
[24:14] have a chat. you know, let's just have a
[24:17] close kind of, you know, you know,
[24:19] that's that's how I feel anyway. It's
[24:21] cold out there, but toasty and nice
[24:23] here. So, you know, we live in a we live
[24:25] in a day, you know, as as uh brother
[24:27] Bram speaks about in the Bible declares
[24:29] about how there comes a season of
[24:31] jubilee, right? There's a season of
[24:33] jubilee. And and it says here in
[24:35] Leviticus, is just a bit of a background
[24:36] tonight, but it says, "Thou shalt number
[24:38] seven Sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
[24:40] times seven years. In the space of seven
[24:42] Sabbaths of years shall uh there be unto
[24:45] thee, 409 years. Then shalt thou cause
[24:48] the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound in
[24:50] the 10th day of the seventh month. In
[24:51] the day of atonement shall ye make the
[24:53] trumpet sound throughout all your land.
[24:55] And ye shall hallow hall the 50th year,
[24:57] and proclaim liberty throughout all the
[24:59] land unto all the inhabitants thereof.
[25:01] And it shall be a jubilee unto you, and
[25:03] ye shall return every man unto his
[25:05] possession, and ye shall return every
[25:07] man unto his family. So when the gospel
[25:10] goes forth, when the message of the hour
[25:12] is proclaimed, it's a jubilee trumpet to
[25:15] take us out of servantthood and place us
[25:17] back as sons to replace us back to where
[25:19] we should be, should have been in the
[25:21] beginning. So that's that's what the
[25:22] word does. That's the dynamics of the
[25:24] end time revival is placing a people as
[25:26] sons in Christ. Okay? So now, but we all
[25:30] started off in slavery. Whether we like
[25:32] it or not, we're all servants. We were
[25:34] sons, but we were servants. Then we
[25:36] became sons as a position. Okay. So,
[25:41] let's me just um put this on here.
[25:46] So, I don't want to I just want to make
[25:47] sure I don't miss anything. So, the
[25:50] scripture that we read um there in the
[25:51] opening, we're just going to go a bit
[25:53] slower a bit, okay? But we'll get there,
[25:54] okay? But so, it says here in Galatians
[25:56] 4, this is the whole piece. We we just
[25:58] read the last two verses, but it says,
[26:00] "Now I say that the heir, as long as he
[26:02] is a child, differ from a servant,
[26:04] though he be lord of all." So, so we are
[26:06] all so the child he may be lord of all
[26:08] but but but he's he's the same as a
[26:10] servant, right? But then but then is
[26:12] under tutors and governors until the
[26:14] time appointed of the father. Even so we
[26:16] when we were children were were in
[26:18] bondage under the elements of the world.
[26:20] But when the fullness of time was come,
[26:22] God sent forth a son made of a woman
[26:24] made under the law to redeem them that
[26:26] were under the law that we might receive
[26:28] the adoption of sons. Now that word
[26:29] adoption is the placing of a son or a
[26:32] daughter. It's you being placed in the
[26:33] family that your name on the check is as
[26:36] good as the father's. Right? Your what
[26:37] you say is the same as what the father
[26:39] says. It's exactly the same voice
[26:41] speaking. And so there has to come a
[26:43] time and I believe we're living in that
[26:44] season very much that we have been
[26:46] placed as sons. So we go from servants
[26:48] to being uh sons. Now brother Brandon
[26:52] speaks about this uh in a in a kind of a
[26:55] different way. He he he says in the
[26:58] sermon why are people so tossed about? I
[27:00] think it's a very uh very pertinent uh
[27:02] sermon for for the day and hour which we
[27:04] live. He says there's two he actually
[27:06] says there's two phases of Christianity.
[27:09] There's two phases just like a son going
[27:12] from a servant to a son. There's two
[27:13] phases of life. Okay, you start as a
[27:16] servant but you're a son but then you
[27:17] become a son. You're no longer a
[27:19] servant. Right? And and he says there's
[27:20] two phases of Christianity. He says one
[27:22] of them is intellectual or a mental
[27:24] conception of what God has said in his
[27:26] word and of Jesus Christ by the way of
[27:28] knowledge. So someone can have uh have
[27:31] all the knowledge of the word can be
[27:32] just perfect but it can just be an
[27:34] intellectual conception but then it goes
[27:37] on from that and the other is an
[27:38] experimental experience that God has
[27:40] given the man in his heart. So it goes
[27:42] from you say being just intellectual to
[27:44] a reality and same thing being a a a
[27:47] servant to a son right you're you're a
[27:50] servant you're under tutors you're told
[27:51] what to do and all these things but then
[27:53] you're placed in the family as a son in
[27:55] reality of what you're meant to be and
[27:57] and these two phases of Christianity are
[27:59] within the message right people start
[28:01] off intellectual they start off with a
[28:03] you know a mental understanding and and
[28:05] sometimes people can go through this
[28:07] phase for years but there comes a time
[28:10] when they when they step through the
[28:11] inner veil. They go into the Holy of
[28:13] Holies and it's no longer an
[28:15] intellectual understanding. It's a
[28:16] living reality. Amen. See, one
[28:19] intellectually is hungering. He is
[28:21] feasting on God, but his feast doesn't
[28:23] hold out. The other one seems to have
[28:25] the victory all the time. There's
[28:27] nothing bothers them. They're just as
[28:28] solid and anchored as they can be. No
[28:30] trials, no storms bother them at all.
[28:33] But they seem to have something about
[28:35] them that people who are Christians and
[28:37] trying to live for God admire that type
[28:40] of Christian. So there's there's the two
[28:43] phases right now. The Lord doesn't want
[28:45] us to be servants. He does not want any
[28:48] of us to be servants. He wants us to be
[28:50] sons and daughters of God. And so under
[28:53] the blood of bulls and goats, Israel was
[28:54] just a servant. Okay? But then when the
[28:57] Lord came, he began to speak to his
[28:59] disciples. And he used to speak in
[29:00] different actually the same language we
[29:02] um he gave to Abraham. Abraham was a
[29:04] friend of God, right? Under a grace
[29:06] covenant. And the and the people of God
[29:09] in this day are the friends of God or
[29:11] the bride of Jesus Christ. I'm going to
[29:13] come into that because it's all about
[29:14] relationship, right? And then now he
[29:16] says he says, "You are my friends if you
[29:18] do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth
[29:21] I call you not servants, for the servant
[29:22] knoweth not what his lord doeth, but I
[29:25] have called you friends. For all things
[29:26] that I've heard of my father, I have
[29:28] made known unto you. You have not chosen
[29:30] me, but I have chosen you and ordained
[29:32] you that you should go and bring forth
[29:34] fruit, and that your fruit should
[29:35] remain, that whatsoever you shall ask of
[29:38] the father in my name, I may give it
[29:40] you. These things I command you that you
[29:42] that ye love one another. So the Lord is
[29:45] telling his disciples very plainly, I'm
[29:47] going to lift you higher in relationship
[29:48] than you ever been. You've been
[29:50] servants. You've been to a certain
[29:51] level, but I've never that's that's
[29:53] never where I wanted you to end up. up.
[29:54] I want you to be my friends. Amen.
[29:56] Because a friend and a servant have got
[29:58] totally different relationships to the
[29:59] boss, right? One is purely a work
[30:01] relationship.
[30:03] It's a it's a job description. Do this,
[30:05] do this, don't do this. If you do, if
[30:08] you don't, you get fired, right? But a
[30:10] friend or I say or I say a son can never
[30:13] be fired, right? It's very different.
[30:15] Now, I'm just going to see. So, so we're
[30:18] we are in this day lifted up from
[30:20] servants to sons. Now, both servants and
[30:22] sons serve
[30:24] Right? They both serve. Okay? So, um
[30:27] because in the Bible, we are called
[30:28] servants as well, but that's not our
[30:30] relationship to God. But we both so both
[30:32] sons and servants serve, but that's
[30:34] really where they similar similarity
[30:37] stays because now there's a big
[30:39] differentiation. Son uh servants fear.
[30:43] There's always a fear of a servant can
[30:44] get fired,
[30:46] right? You don't do what you're told,
[30:47] you're fired. Lucifer went beyond his
[30:49] job description, tried to be like God,
[30:52] he got fired. Yes, an angel is a
[30:54] servant. Never part of the royal family.
[30:56] He got fired. Okay, he's still fussing
[30:58] about that firing, but he's going to be
[30:59] burnt up in the lake of fire, right? But
[31:01] but he was a he's now a fired servant.
[31:04] Okay, that's all he is. He's just a tool
[31:07] in God's hand for our good. Okay? So, so
[31:10] a a servant, there is a fear you can get
[31:12] fired, but a son can never be fired. A
[31:15] son can never be fired from being part
[31:17] of the family. It's impossible because
[31:19] the same life of in the in the father is
[31:21] in the son.
[31:23] Amen. Just like by the baptism of the
[31:24] Holy Ghost, the same life in God is in
[31:26] you and I, right? Deity is in flesh once
[31:29] again. Amen. Servants uh their their per
[31:33] you know their work or how how they view
[31:35] they should be rewarded is based on
[31:37] performance. Someone at work, you know,
[31:39] they work harder, they get rewarded.
[31:41] It's all about what they do naturally in
[31:43] order to get somewhere. And it's the
[31:45] same thing with God. People think if I
[31:47] if I pray enough, if I do enough, if I
[31:50] line up to the word enough, then
[31:51] therefore God will re will reward me.
[31:55] But a son doesn't do that. Do they get
[31:57] lax and no because there can be a
[31:59] servant who's very diligent and there's
[32:01] a servant who can be very lazy. So one
[32:03] can be gathering up all the hay and
[32:05] working twice as hard as everyone else
[32:07] in the field and the other servant can
[32:08] be asleep behind the hay stack. They're
[32:10] both servants, right? Right? So a
[32:12] servant can either be very very um
[32:15] dogmatic and strict in what he does
[32:17] serving God or they can be asleep doing
[32:19] nothing thinking who cares right but a
[32:22] son lives the life of the father the
[32:25] life of the word lives out of them very
[32:27] different to laboring in the field right
[32:29] amen so so a servant's all about
[32:32] performance and then because of that
[32:34] servants compare and contrast so where
[32:36] you see servantthood on a person you see
[32:39] jealousy you see strife you see
[32:41] complaint saints because God may
[32:44] supernaturally bless someone else and
[32:46] they'll see that and a son will say,
[32:47] "Praise God. Hallelujah. God, thank you
[32:50] Lord for answering that prayer. Thank
[32:51] you for undertaking for that person." A
[32:53] servant will say, "But what about me?
[32:55] That's not fair." See, that's
[32:57] servantthood mentality. That's not
[32:59] sunship mentality, right? A son is
[33:01] always happy to see God be blessed by
[33:03] the father, right? A servant gets
[33:05] annoyed. They may pretend to say, "I'm
[33:06] so happy for you, but in their heart
[33:08] there, Lord, that's not fair. Look what
[33:10] I did, Lord. I went beyond my job
[33:12] description, Lord. Did you not see what
[33:14] I've been doing? And they, you know,
[33:15] they love to live that kind of life cuz
[33:18] they think they earn their way into
[33:20] something closer with God. We don't earn
[33:22] nothing. We surrender to the word and
[33:25] let him come and live in our lives.
[33:27] Amen. So, a son is never about
[33:28] performance-based, just about letting
[33:30] the Lord live the life out of us. Amen.
[33:32] So, you see, you know, um, servants,
[33:35] there is a gap between a servant and a
[33:37] boss. There's always, you know, there's
[33:39] a always a different relationship. You
[33:42] your it's it's a work relationship. So,
[33:44] so the boss will never share his, well,
[33:47] he shouldn't his innermost heart and
[33:50] desires with a servant because this
[33:53] guy's a servant. Why, you know, why
[33:54] would I share my innermost desires and
[33:56] what I want and things and thoughts with
[33:58] someone I've employed? But if they're
[34:00] part of my family, I want to share my
[34:03] innermost being with them to lift them
[34:05] up to where I am. Right? that and you
[34:07] know that's why the words come open in
[34:09] this day because God shared his most
[34:11] innermost heart desires the back part of
[34:13] God's mind. Brother Bram says when he
[34:15] preaches Christ the mystery God
[34:16] revealed. He says what was hidden in in
[34:18] in the back part of God's mind. I'm
[34:20] going to tell you right now what it is.
[34:22] Right? And what does it do? It lifts us
[34:23] up into a closer walk with God. But a
[34:26] servant you you know you'd never share
[34:28] that with a servant cuz he's a servant.
[34:30] But your son or your daughter, your
[34:31] family, you want to share the innermost
[34:33] part of you because you want them close.
[34:35] You want them to know you far more than
[34:37] anyone anyone else ever could. Why?
[34:39] Because they're part of you.
[34:42] So it's very different. There's a big
[34:43] gap between servants and sons.
[34:47] Amen. Because with a servant, it's just
[34:48] a work relationship. With a son, it's a
[34:51] family relationship.
[34:53] Praise the Lord. Amen. You know, it's
[34:54] like the parable of the talents. The one
[34:56] that was given the one talent because of
[34:59] fear. They buried their talent. They
[35:01] buried their talent because it was a
[35:03] fear relationship. Not f a i r f e a r
[35:08] relationship. He was afraid of when the
[35:10] master comes back. What if he fails?
[35:11] What if he does something wrong? He
[35:13] doesn't realize what he's been given
[35:15] will produce what it's meant to produce.
[35:17] You see? But so, so someone who's got a
[35:19] servantthood mentality can shut down and
[35:22] do nothing because of fear. What if I
[35:24] put a foot wrong? What if I do this?
[35:26] What if I stuff up here? And it's all
[35:28] their whole Christian walk is motivated
[35:30] by fear. And it sounds funny to say walk
[35:33] because really they're just standing
[35:34] still. Their whole Christian stand is
[35:36] based on fear. But a son realizes, well,
[35:38] if I do it wrong, God, he God's going to
[35:40] come and he's going to guide me. He's
[35:42] going to correct me in a way for my best
[35:44] interest in mind because he's going to
[35:46] show me a better way to walk. That's a
[35:48] son. Amen. It's not a fair relationship.
[35:50] It's a love relationship. Right? Because
[35:53] why? You are part of him.
[35:57] Amen. Now
[35:59] a servant
[36:02] sorry here
[36:05] the apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians
[36:07] chapter 2 here he says now but their
[36:09] minds were blinded speaking of Israel
[36:10] until the day this for until this day
[36:12] rema um remainth the same veil untaken
[36:15] away in the reading of the old testament
[36:17] which veil is done away in Christ but
[36:19] even unto this day when Moses is read
[36:22] the veil is taken uh is upon their heart
[36:24] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[36:26] Lord the veil shall be taken away. Now
[36:29] the spirit, now the Lord is that spirit.
[36:31] And where the spirit of the Lord is,
[36:32] there is liberty. Now this word liberty,
[36:35] I know I've I've, you know, shared it
[36:37] before, but this liberty means to be
[36:39] unrestrained. You can go at pleasure. So
[36:42] you're not restricted by servantthood.
[36:43] No, you're a son. You can walk into that
[36:46] position. You can you can manifest that
[36:48] position. You're not restricted by fear
[36:50] or anything that would value from God.
[36:52] You can walk with him. You can go, you
[36:53] know, free completely.
[36:56] So you see a servant can do everything
[36:58] out of the flesh but a son operates by
[37:00] the spirit. Amen. And of course the
[37:03] anointing of God gives them liberty to
[37:05] fulfill the word. Praise the Lord. Now
[37:09] um this is in this is from time test uh
[37:12] tested faith produces goods because I've
[37:14] often wondered you know you know brother
[37:16] makes such a startling statement. He
[37:18] said well I'll just read it here. He
[37:19] says you know he's seen good sainted
[37:21] people cross the platform and not be
[37:24] healed. But then he's seen prostitutes
[37:26] or people off the street come come
[37:28] across the platform, be instantly,
[37:29] miraculously healed, and walk out
[37:31] rejoicing because they got what they
[37:32] needed. And he's asking a question, why?
[37:34] Why does this happen? Because you think
[37:36] it would be the other way around. You
[37:38] think the good sainted person who's been
[37:39] serving God and believing the Lord and
[37:41] loving the Lord all the days of their
[37:43] life pretty much would instantly be
[37:45] touched by God and God would touch them.
[37:47] But the prostitute, not so much, right?
[37:49] But you see what happens is if if a
[37:53] person is still under servantthood, they
[37:54] think God owes them something because
[37:57] they've been working. Look, God, you owe
[37:59] me an answer to prayer. God, you owe me
[38:02] a miracle. Lord, Lord, I have earned
[38:04] this. I have served you. I've gone out
[38:06] of my way above and beyond my job
[38:08] description. Lord, you owe me this, God.
[38:12] That's how people's at. See how I asked
[38:14] on Sunday, how's your heart?
[38:16] You know, this is this is just a part
[38:18] two really. We're just continuing on
[38:19] this vein of thought, you know, are you
[38:20] happy in here? Are you content or more
[38:23] than content that you're a son or
[38:24] daughter of God? Or are you still under
[38:26] this servantthood mentality of trying to
[38:28] earn something and get something? It's
[38:30] like people try and, you know, they'll
[38:32] study the word to to to to gain actually
[38:34] knowledge, not revelation because it's
[38:36] not quickened. And they think, God, I've
[38:37] got this revelation now. You owe me
[38:39] something.
[38:41] That's servantthood. Sons are Lord, I'm
[38:44] walking with you. You called me. Now
[38:45] reveal yourself as we walk, Lord. Amen.
[38:47] God unfolds his word and you just enjoy
[38:50] him. You're not trying to earn anything
[38:52] by the revelation that you have
[38:53] gathered. I trust this comes out all in
[38:56] balance, right? But you know, because we
[38:58] can't say, "Look, Lord, I I know this
[38:59] and I know this and quoting doctrines
[39:01] and it can all be perfectly right and
[39:02] say, Lord, now you owe me a rapture."
[39:05] No, we're going in the rapture cuz we're
[39:07] sons. We're not going cuz we're
[39:09] servants. And God doesn't want servants.
[39:11] He wants sons. He doesn't want people to
[39:13] work for him and not know him
[39:14] intimately. He doesn't want a servant
[39:17] can know about the boss but only he'll
[39:18] only know part of the boss right he'll
[39:21] only know one side of the boss even at a
[39:24] work do he'll only know one side but his
[39:26] the boss's family will know that boss
[39:28] far greater because that they are part
[39:31] of his family than a servant ever will
[39:35] amen so he says because the Christians
[39:37] sometimes think God's owes it to them
[39:39] what that I'm a good person I've done so
[39:41] and so when you get that in your mind
[39:44] you'll never get anything from God till
[39:45] you get that out of your mind. That's
[39:48] such a see that's such a trap of a
[39:50] legalistic idea. God, you owe me
[39:52] something. He doesn't owe anyone
[39:53] anything.
[39:55] Amen. Who called you? Did you? No, he
[39:57] called you. Who saved you? He did. Who
[40:01] sanctified you? He did. Who's revealed
[40:04] his word to you? He did. Who's given you
[40:06] the Holy Ghost? Well, if you're a son,
[40:08] you've got it. He did. Right. It's his
[40:10] grace. What does he owe you?
[40:14] another
[40:16] but so we can't have this in our mind it
[40:18] says and when but you see servants can
[40:20] be very religious they can actually
[40:22] adopt a religious spirit where the life
[40:25] of God will not flow but a religion will
[40:27] and that you know servants who's you
[40:29] ever seen in a workplace I'm sure we all
[40:31] have that you know are at work even at
[40:33] school there's certain members of the
[40:35] class or your colleagues that will try
[40:38] and dominate though they're not in a
[40:40] position of authority they will try and
[40:42] control they'll try and give all the
[40:45] good ideas. They'll try and, you know,
[40:47] they'll try and make others look bad for
[40:49] them to look good.
[40:51] That's servantthood. That's not sunship,
[40:56] right? So, we can't. But you see, a
[40:58] religious spirit will do that. Will try
[40:59] and control, try and keep others down to
[41:01] make themselves look good. But those who
[41:04] have the Holy Ghost want others to look
[41:06] good. They want the Lord to be exalted.
[41:08] Number one, Brother Ram says, "How do
[41:10] you know a great person? Cuz that person
[41:12] makes you feel great. When you leave
[41:14] their presence, it's not all about them
[41:15] and what they do and how great they are.
[41:17] No, the a great person lifts others up
[41:20] and they feel and and the pe, you know,
[41:22] when people leave their presence, they
[41:23] feel refreshed. They feel happy. They
[41:25] feel at peace. Why? Because they've
[41:26] actually been in the presence of a great
[41:28] person. But a great person doesn't one
[41:30] doesn't think they're great and two
[41:31] doesn't project that cuz they think,
[41:33] Lord, I'm just I'm your child. You found
[41:36] me, Lord. I'm just glad to know you,
[41:38] Lord. that you
[41:40] but but people who think they're great
[41:42] often are not great. And people who
[41:44] think they're great are actually
[41:45] servants.
[41:46] Sons don't need to prove anything.
[41:49] Hallelujah. Amen. But you see, that's a
[41:51] religious spirit trying to control,
[41:52] trying to lift themselves up. But but a
[41:54] son just lifts up his father or her
[41:56] father. Amen. And most times when people
[41:58] are religious, they think God owes them
[42:00] something. I just want to repeat this
[42:01] from a different sermon. I've seen
[42:02] people who has lived in a church a
[42:04] straight life come to the platform and
[42:06] fail to be healed when a prostitute off
[42:08] the street would come humbly and bound
[42:09] the prince of God and reckon herself to
[42:11] be a prostitute, ask forgiveness and be
[42:13] healed of um sarcomus cancer where a
[42:16] Christian walked across with merely a
[42:17] little headache and failed to get it.
[42:19] God doesn't judge you or heal you by
[42:21] your church affiliation. It's according
[42:23] to your faith you are healed.
[42:26] Amen.
[42:28] I was trying to catch up here. So we
[42:31] must never see if if if someone's owed
[42:34] something,
[42:36] it's because there's actually a jealousy
[42:39] that's motivating them. And they're only
[42:42] happy when everyone else is down. When
[42:44] everyone's up there, they're down cuz
[42:46] they're jealous. It's not fair, Lord.
[42:48] Why me? You know, why this? God's
[42:51] sovereign. Everything's working for our
[42:52] good. Amen. Right? We don't need to
[42:55] worry about what God is doing. We just
[42:57] have to have confidence. Lord, you are
[42:59] going to use this for my good. Good
[43:01] times, bad times, every time is a good
[43:03] time for you cuz all things work
[43:05] together for your good.
[43:07] Amen. So, it's not about fairness or
[43:09] what happens to others. No, it's not
[43:11] about that at all, Lord. I'm just
[43:12] walking with you.
[43:15] Amen. So now, if we are no longer
[43:18] servants, but we're sons, what do we
[43:21] have to see? A servant is living in
[43:23] fear. Am I going to make it? Am I not?
[43:26] Am I going through the great tribul? Am
[43:27] I going in the rapture? Well, I don't
[43:28] know because it's all about metrics.
[43:31] Who's ever seen like metrics, you know,
[43:32] analytics? How are you tracking and all
[43:34] these things? It's all about performance
[43:36] and yeah, well, I'm definitely 110% up
[43:38] of joy this this week, but months I'm
[43:40] about 200% down, so I'm not doing too
[43:43] good. You all those things, you know,
[43:44] yeah, this is going better. My bank
[43:46] account's more and this is fine. It's
[43:47] all about metrics. But a son is I'm a
[43:50] child of the king. I'm never out of his
[43:52] care. He can't lose me because I'm part
[43:54] of him. Amen. I cannot be lost cuz he
[43:57] cannot lose his own. Right? So it
[43:59] totally changes it. So so a son is not
[44:01] afraid. They're going to miss the
[44:03] rapture. That's what I'm saying. How's
[44:05] your heart? If you're afraid, you don't
[44:06] need to stay afraid. You don't need to
[44:08] live in fear, right? We're not going to,
[44:10] you know, God doesn't want us to be
[44:12] fearful because fear brings separation.
[44:14] Just like in the garden, Adam and Eve
[44:16] fell. The voice of God was walking in
[44:18] the garden. And what was God wanted?
[44:19] Fellowship. Adam and Eve hid because of
[44:22] fear. They were afraid of what God would
[44:24] do to them. What? It was fear that
[44:26] caused separation. God doesn't want us
[44:28] to be afraid. You don't need to be
[44:29] afraid. Amen. So, brother says, "What
[44:33] are you scared about? Are you afraid to
[44:35] take his his word for anything?" Don't
[44:37] be afraid. Call the thing right. I am an
[44:39] heir to this. Oh, I know I don't deserve
[44:42] it, but I'm an ear anyhow. A servant
[44:43] will think I'm not worthy. Therefore,
[44:45] they won't receive it. But a heir or a
[44:47] son just says, "Well, it's not about
[44:49] what I have done. It's what he has
[44:51] promised." Right? So it's not about we
[44:54] are all unworthy by the way but it's not
[44:57] our worthiness that counts. It never
[44:58] has. It never will. It never could
[45:00] amount to nothing. Not even hillbeans.
[45:02] Amen. But it's his worthiness that
[45:04] stands. His worthiness is how I'm going
[45:06] in a rapture. Nothing else. Salvation is
[45:09] of the Lord. It's by grace alone we are
[45:11] saved. It's the blood of Jesus Christ
[45:14] alone, not your good works. So it's not
[45:16] your performance as a servant. It's what
[45:18] God has done. You know, brother Brown
[45:20] makes a statement. He says, "I could go
[45:21] hunting and fishing for the rest of my
[45:23] life every day and it wouldn't touch my
[45:24] salvation."
[45:26] A servant will go all jittery with that
[45:28] kind of statement. Say, "Well, how can
[45:29] you? Cuz you know, you're not doing what
[45:31] you should be doing and you know your
[45:32] calling. Here's your job description.
[45:33] You not fulfilling it. You're going to
[45:35] get fired, man." He No, no, I'm a son of
[45:36] God. But because of love, because of
[45:40] love for the Lord and for his people,
[45:42] what the prophet did what he did, right?
[45:44] He gave his life because of He was
[45:46] motivated by love, not by fear. Amen. I
[45:49] trust tonight we are motivated by the
[45:51] love of God, not by the fear of man.
[45:55] Amen. Servants worry what other people
[45:58] say about them. What will this person
[46:01] think? What will that person think?
[46:02] Well, I better not shout. I better not
[46:03] be too happy. I better not be too lively
[46:06] or I better be lively or I better shout
[46:08] because this person. They're always
[46:10] looking at what other people say about
[46:12] them. But a son only cares what the
[46:14] father wants. They're he they are
[46:16] interested in his word and pleasing him
[46:18] alone. Not to earn anything, but because
[46:20] they love him because he first loved
[46:22] them. Amen. So call the thing right. I'm
[46:25] an heir to this. Oh, I don't deserve it,
[46:27] but I'm an ear anyhow because I'm an
[46:29] air. I receive it. Amen. That's it.
[46:30] There you are. Because I'm an ear.
[46:32] That's it. We are air of salvation. Heir
[46:34] of the Holy Spirit. I'm an air because
[46:36] Jesus paid the price. Nothing I had to
[46:38] do. I just fell air to it. Amen. I'm
[46:40] healed because I'm an ear to it. My
[46:42] diseases are gone. My affliction is
[46:43] gone. Why? Because I'm an heir to it.
[46:46] Oh, perfect assurance, Jesus is mine.
[46:49] Amen. So, every redemptive blessing we
[46:51] fall heir to because of him, not because
[46:54] of us. I like that. That means I can get
[46:57] it. Amen. Why? Cuz he's done it. Amen.
[47:00] He says, now he says, "Oh, what a
[47:03] foretaste of glory, divine heir of
[47:04] salvation, purchase of God, born of his
[47:06] spirit, washed in his blood." That's my
[47:08] that's our story. Oh, then Satan can't
[47:12] stand that. See, because he's a defeated
[47:14] being. He's nothing but a bluff. Jesus
[47:16] paid the price. Called us by his grace.
[47:18] We're here. What a perfect setup that
[47:20] is. It's rigged. Praise God. Amen. See,
[47:22] he's already defeated. I never defeated
[47:24] him. Christ defeated him. I'm just
[47:26] claiming my own god-given privileges.
[47:29] That's all you do. You just tell Satan,
[47:31] "Get away from here. I've got an
[47:32] abstract deed on this building. It's
[47:34] mine. I ed it." I don't even know if
[47:37] that's a word, but I like it. I ed it.
[47:38] Satan, get out in the name of Jesus
[47:40] Christ. Whatever redemptive blessing you
[47:42] place your claim on, you say, "Satan,
[47:44] get away from it." I added it. Amen. I
[47:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I've
[47:48] added healing. I've added peace. I've
[47:50] added prodals coming home. I've had
[47:52] every redemptive blessing. I added it.
[47:54] Satan, get away in the name of Jesus
[47:55] Christ. Hallelujah.
[47:58] Amen. Do you see now, now this may see
[48:01] now this is Ruth gleaning in the field.
[48:04] What if Ruth What if this was the day
[48:06] after their honeymoon and they came back
[48:08] home and Ruth goes back in the field?
[48:11] That won't make sense, eh? You say,
[48:13] "What are you doing, Ruth?" "Oh, I'm
[48:15] just trying to survive and you know, I'm
[48:16] just trying to glean and this is where
[48:18] I've been and but God doesn't want us to
[48:20] stay in servantthood." Boaz could have
[48:22] came and go and say, "Honey, what are
[48:23] you doing? Why Why are you behind the
[48:26] reapers trying to meek out a living?"
[48:28] No, you've aired it, Ruth. You've aired
[48:31] this whole place. Th this whole place,
[48:33] Ruth, is yours. You don't need to try
[48:36] and survive and meek out. Oh, but I'm
[48:38] just being humble and you know, God
[48:39] saved me. You know, Boaz, you saved me
[48:41] by your grace and you called me. No, no,
[48:43] no, no, no. That servantthood mentality,
[48:44] you got to realize, no, I'm married to
[48:47] the king. Amen. I aired it. Amen. He
[48:50] came down and offered, you know, his
[48:52] hand in marriage. Will you marry me? And
[48:54] you say, absolutely. Hallelujah, Lord.
[48:56] So everything he has, you're fallen heir
[48:58] to. So she doesn't need to go back. We
[49:01] don't need to have a servantthood. See,
[49:02] but servants, if you listen to them,
[49:04] will try and make you a servant.
[49:07] But we should not listen to servants to
[49:09] try and put us back into servantthood.
[49:11] We should listen to the word of God that
[49:13] says, "You're a son." Right? So, if she
[49:15] listened to the reapers and they I don't
[49:17] know why they'd do it because they're
[49:18] they're loyal reapers. But what if they
[49:20] say, "Hey, Ruth, you got to come back
[49:21] and glean in the field."
[49:24] But a servant, a real servant say,
[49:26] "Ruth, we are at your command.
[49:28] What do you have need of? Because we
[49:30] work for we're Hey, we can't be married
[49:32] to Boaz. We're servants, but what can we
[49:34] do for you? Amen. So, we never want to
[49:38] we we never want to come back into
[49:40] servantthood again. I trust this is
[49:41] okay. How we doing? We're doing good
[49:43] now. See,
[49:47] see, it's it isn't some law. See,
[49:49] servants live by a law. Thou shalt, thou
[49:52] shalt not. Thou shalt do this. And the
[49:54] word says this, and this is the message.
[49:55] This how it's got to be. You got to keep
[49:56] it like this. No, we don't live it by
[49:59] that way. The word still stands, but we
[50:02] don't live it by that way. Our
[50:03] motivation is not fear of being fired.
[50:06] Right? See, it isn't some law that I
[50:08] have to preach the gospel. It isn't some
[50:09] law that I have to do this. It's because
[50:11] I love him so much. I just love to do
[50:14] it. Praise God. Amen. It's because I And
[50:18] if we you love him like that, as long as
[50:20] I love my wife like that, she don't
[50:23] never have to worry. Okay? So a servant,
[50:25] it's all about terms and conditions. A
[50:28] son's all about relationship.
[50:30] Okay. So as long as Okay. So So as long
[50:34] as my wife, as long as I love my wife
[50:36] like that, she don't need to never
[50:37] worry. As long as she loves me like
[50:39] that, she don't have to worry. We don't
[50:41] go around one to another. Now, if she'll
[50:43] say, "Now you listen here, Mr. Brandham.
[50:46] Tell you something right now. You're
[50:47] going away on this trip. I'm going to
[50:50] lay the law right down to you. Don't you
[50:52] run around on me, young man. Oh no.
[50:54] Don't you do that. Well, after she gets
[50:56] the laying down the law, um laying down
[50:58] the law, then I turn back and I say,
[51:00] "Now, my fair lady, let me tell you
[51:02] something. While I'm gone, don't you
[51:04] have no other husbands? Don't you do
[51:05] this and don't you do that?" Well, we we
[51:08] don't say that. Sure. I just love her so
[51:10] much. My trust is in her and she loves
[51:12] me so much in the same way. Uh so we I
[51:15] say goodbye, sweetheart. Be praying for
[51:17] me all right there. I'll be praying for
[51:18] you all the time. Hurry back. All right.
[51:20] That's all of it.
[51:23] That's all of it. I know it's very
[51:26] simple, but love a relationship
[51:30] takes away all the terms and conditions.
[51:33] Of course, if you, you know, just like
[51:35] husband and wife, if you love your
[51:36] spouse enough, those terms and
[51:39] conditions, of course, they're there,
[51:40] but you're not going to have to worry
[51:41] about
[51:43] women or men and all these things. Why?
[51:44] Because you love them so much. Amen.
[51:47] You're not living in fear. Oh, what if
[51:48] someone comes along? No. You love them
[51:50] so much. That's totally out of the
[51:52] picture. You can stand there as a son
[51:54] and turn down temptation. Just like
[51:56] Joseph, you know, when Piper's wife came
[51:58] in and tried to sleep with him,
[51:59] committed adultery, he says, "No, I'm
[52:01] not going to sin against my God." He ran
[52:02] away cuz he was a son. He wasn't a
[52:05] servant. If he had a servant mentality,
[52:07] he would have fallen to that would have
[52:09] been a terrible thing. But because he
[52:11] was a son and he loved the Lord so much,
[52:13] he wasn't willing for any of those
[52:15] things to even come near his mind.
[52:18] Amen.
[52:19] That's all of it. See, you just love the
[52:21] Lord enough, you don't need to fear
[52:22] nothing. Amen. See, you ain't you ain't
[52:26] got no big well, you have to come and be
[52:28] this way and sprinkled and confirmed and
[52:31] brought to this and that and these and
[52:33] that and all these different orders and
[52:34] things like that. And if you don't dance
[52:35] with your feet crossed this way, it
[52:37] ain't right. And you have to dance with
[52:38] your feet crossed this way. See, he's
[52:40] saying it's not all the all these orders
[52:42] and things you got to do that that's
[52:43] servantthood mentality. Who's with me
[52:45] tonight? And I trust this makes sense.
[52:47] It's not all well my skirt's this long,
[52:49] my uh sleeve is this long. My hair's
[52:51] like this and this and this is this. No,
[52:54] you love him so much. Then the Lord will
[52:56] show you what to do.
[52:58] Amen. And because you love him, you're
[53:00] like, "Yes, Lord. Of course, because
[53:02] why? You have the same heart. You got
[53:03] the same mind." Amen. Because you got
[53:05] the mind of Christ. Praise the Lord.
[53:08] Now, we all know this story very well.
[53:11] Where where's the Oh, well, I'll I'll
[53:13] just put this up here. We all know the
[53:15] story very well of the prodical son. It
[53:17] says that the father had two sons. Now
[53:23] we know the story that the youngest son
[53:25] he said give me all all that's mine ran
[53:29] off spent it you know wasted all of that
[53:32] inheritance and writers living in a far
[53:34] country. Then there's a great um you
[53:36] know a great famine came up in that
[53:37] place and then finally he finds himself
[53:39] and he's feeding pigs you know feeding
[53:42] you know feeding pigs and he's so hungry
[53:44] he you know he's jealous of what the
[53:45] pigs are eating and then and you know
[53:46] they're eating scraps but then he came
[53:48] to himself he thought even my the
[53:51] servants of my father are living in a
[53:54] better state than I am. So he goes back
[53:57] and he decides well but I was going to
[54:02] he says now he says this from verse um I
[54:06] just want to leave that picture up there
[54:07] because God doesn't want many people
[54:09] want to stay like that
[54:12] but God doesn't want us to stay like
[54:13] that because the son says I'm just going
[54:16] to go back and be a servant to my
[54:17] father. I'm not worthy to be called his
[54:20] son anymore. I'm going to be a servant.
[54:22] And many people get this in their mind
[54:24] because they know they're unworthy. They
[54:26] know there's a place at the table and
[54:27] they're genuinely thankful, but they for
[54:29] some reason want to keep themselves as
[54:31] servants.
[54:33] But when when the son came back, the
[54:35] father came running cuz the father was
[54:37] looking for his son to return. And wait,
[54:40] maybe maybe just put it up here so you
[54:41] can read along with me. He says this
[54:44] here. He says, "And when he came to
[54:46] himself," this is a son in the pig pen.
[54:47] He said, "How many hired servants of my
[54:49] father have bread enough to spare and I
[54:51] perish with hunger? I'll arise and go to
[54:53] my father and will say unto him, Father,
[54:55] I have sinned against heaven and before
[54:57] the before thee. I I am no longer worthy
[55:00] to be called thy son. Make me as one of
[55:02] thy hired servants now. And so he arose,
[55:06] came back to his father, and when he was
[55:07] yet a great way off, the father saw him,
[55:09] had compassion, and ran and fell on his
[55:11] neck, and kissed him. And the son said
[55:13] unto him, "Father, I have sinned against
[55:14] heaven in thy sight, and am no more
[55:16] worthy to be called thy son." So the son
[55:18] had already made up his mind. I can
[55:20] never be a son again. I'm not worthy to
[55:21] be a son. I've ruined my life. I've
[55:23] ruined my inheritance. I've gone too far
[55:25] for too long, but I'm going home and I'm
[55:27] not worthy to be called a son. And he
[55:30] even says this to his father. But now
[55:32] notice the father never says to the son,
[55:34] "That's a good idea, son.
[55:37] At least you're home, but go sit in the
[55:39] corner. You're not welcome at the table
[55:41] because you forfeited your right to the
[55:43] table. You forfeited your right to be
[55:45] living in my house. You forfeited the
[55:47] right of being called by my name. Just
[55:49] go back in the corner." That was never
[55:51] the father's heart. He had no desire for
[55:54] another servant. If he wanted another
[55:56] servant, he would have got one. But he
[55:58] could not get another son. He only had
[56:00] two sons. Amen. And he wanted both of
[56:02] them back in his house. He wasn't
[56:04] willing just to get someone else and
[56:06] make them the son. He wanted his own
[56:08] flesh and blood, back in his presence,
[56:10] back living in his kingdom. That's what
[56:13] he wanted. Amen. And that's what God
[56:14] wants. He doesn't want you to come back
[56:16] as a servant. He wants you to come back
[56:18] in your position as a son or daughter of
[56:20] God. So you see here now this is the son
[56:22] is saying look I'm no longer to be
[56:23] called you know I'm you know I'm no more
[56:26] worthy to be called thy son. See that's
[56:27] a servant mentality. I have done wrong.
[56:30] I fulfill any position that I was born
[56:32] by or born to. But the father does not
[56:35] acknowledge what he says. He doesn't
[56:36] even say anything about what he's done.
[56:38] He just says to his servants bring forth
[56:40] the best robe. Put it on him. Put a ring
[56:42] on his hand and the shoes on his feet
[56:44] and bring hither the fatted calf and
[56:46] kill it and let us eat him and be merry.
[56:48] For this my son was dead and is alive
[56:50] again. He was lost and is found and they
[56:52] began to be married. Hallelujah. So
[56:56] don't be staying as a servant. No, God
[56:58] don't want you as a servant. He doesn't
[57:00] want you as just part of his kingdom.
[57:02] No, you're the apple of his eye. Amen.
[57:04] You're the whole purpose of his being is
[57:06] you being redeemed back to what he
[57:08] wanted you to be in the beginning. Amen.
[57:10] Amen. Because remember, redeemed is not
[57:13] being placed back as a servant. We
[57:15] weren't servants in the beginnings.
[57:16] We're sons and daughters of God. I pray
[57:18] this is sinking in quite nicely. Amen.
[57:20] Webster says about redeem. This is the
[57:22] definition. To buy back, to repurchase,
[57:25] to get or win back. The Lord won you
[57:27] back by his love. Amen. To free from
[57:29] what distresses or harms such as free
[57:32] from captivity by payment of ransom.
[57:34] Amen. To extradite from or or help to
[57:37] overcome something detrimental. Amen. He
[57:40] has extradited you from the shackles of
[57:42] sin. He has extradited or helped you to
[57:44] overcome unbelief. Amen. He has freed
[57:46] you. He has paid your debt. He paid your
[57:48] ransom on Calvary in completeness and in
[57:51] fullness. And there's nothing the devil
[57:53] has against you anymore. Why? Because
[57:54] he's redeemed you. He's bought you back
[57:57] as a son or daughter of God. Hallelujah.
[58:00] To release you from blame or debt. Where
[58:03] is thine accusers? This is why he said
[58:05] to the woman who was brought in
[58:06] adultery, he began to write in the sand
[58:08] probably the sins of all the Pharisees
[58:09] around her. And he said, "He that's
[58:11] without sin, let him cast the first
[58:13] stone." And one by one, they're
[58:14] unconscious because they weren't free of
[58:16] their blame or they're dead of their
[58:18] sin. And their conscience came up. They
[58:20] dropped the stones. They walked away.
[58:21] And then it was finally just the Lord
[58:23] and that woman there. And and and the
[58:25] Lord said to her, "Where are thine
[58:26] accusers?" And she says, "I have none."
[58:28] They said, "Neither do I condemn thee."
[58:30] What? She was redeemed from blame or
[58:32] guilt. Hallelujah. She was released from
[58:35] it. And and then the Lord said to her,
[58:37] "Go and sin no more." Amen. Free from
[58:40] the consequences of sin. I'm free from
[58:43] that one. Hallelujah. Amen. There ain't
[58:45] no lake of fire. There's no great white
[58:47] throne judgment for me. No. I've got I
[58:49] got streets of gold to dance on.
[58:52] Hallelujah. Why? Because I have been
[58:54] redeemed. I have been redeemed back to
[58:56] what I should have been in the
[58:57] beginning.
[58:59] Hallelujah. We got to realize our God is
[59:01] not a our God is not a robot. Our God is
[59:05] not indifferent. Amen. You know it says
[59:08] here in Luke, this is just before the
[59:10] prodical son story. It says, "Likewise,
[59:12] I say unto you, there is great joy in
[59:14] the presence of the angels of God over
[59:16] one sinner that repenteth." So what is
[59:18] that joy in the presence of God? That's
[59:20] God's joy. Amen. That's God's joy. Amen.
[59:23] God has feelings. Amen. He's emotional.
[59:25] Many times we think of the angels
[59:26] breaking out in jubilation when one of
[59:28] his children come home. They ain't
[59:30] breaking out in jubilation like God is.
[59:32] Hallelujah. Amen. Because why? He's look
[59:34] he was looking forward to the day when
[59:36] he met you. Amen. If he hasn't done
[59:37] that, I pray it be tonight that he meets
[59:39] you. Amen. And there be a jubilation
[59:41] break out in the throne of God. Why?
[59:43] Because one of my sons, one of my
[59:44] daughters has opened their lives and
[59:46] I've stepped in and changed them
[59:47] forever. I've redeemed them from the
[59:49] shackles of death. Amen. Hallelujah.
[59:51] That's that's who's rejoicing. Amen.
[59:53] Why? Because our God loves. I mean, he's
[59:55] not just a God of anger and wrath and,
[59:57] you know, all those things. He's a God
[59:59] of love and a God of compassion. He's a
[1:00:01] God who cares. He's a jealous. He's a
[1:00:03] zealous God. I mean, he's a God of
[1:00:05] passion, of love for his bride. Amen.
[1:00:07] He's not an indifferent robot that just
[1:00:09] looks at his word and says, "Do they
[1:00:11] line up? Yes, they're coming in." No, he
[1:00:13] goes far beyond that. Amen. Why? He's a
[1:00:15] God of love. Amen. He cares for you. He
[1:00:17] loves you with unfailing love. Amen. He
[1:00:19] doesn't want you to be a servant. He
[1:00:20] wants you to be a son or a daughter of
[1:00:23] God.
[1:00:25] Hallelujah. Amen. It says in Zephaniah
[1:00:27] 3, "Sing, oh daughter of Zion. Shout, O
[1:00:30] Israel, be glad and rejoice with all the
[1:00:32] heart." Amen. Oh daughter of Jerusalem.
[1:00:35] Amen. The Lord hath taken away thy
[1:00:37] judgments. Now, I just got to jump back
[1:00:38] to this quickly. The reason I put that
[1:00:40] picture there is because the prodigal
[1:00:44] son never sat like that after he was
[1:00:46] redeemed.
[1:00:48] I mean, he never sat there with a glum
[1:00:50] look on his face being dunk ass and
[1:00:52] hungry and jealous of the pigs. There
[1:00:53] weren't any pigs in that kingdom, that's
[1:00:55] for sure. But, you know, he wasn't
[1:00:56] jealous of the livestock he was looking
[1:00:58] after. He wasn't in rags. No, cuz he
[1:01:00] came home. He was redeemed. He got on a
[1:01:02] new robe, sandals, ring. I mean, he was
[1:01:04] placed back in the family.
[1:01:07] But servants want to make you like that
[1:01:09] cuz that's more spiritual.
[1:01:12] No, it's not. It's more spiritual to
[1:01:14] confess what God has made you. Amen. To
[1:01:17] actually confess what the blood has
[1:01:18] done. Amen. To rejoice like God
[1:01:20] rejoices. That's more spiritual. It's
[1:01:23] not spiritual to be downcast.
[1:01:26] You sure we have periods of mourning and
[1:01:28] God bears us in our mourning, but our
[1:01:30] mourning must turn to joy. And there's
[1:01:31] going to be a time when our downcast,
[1:01:33] our negative confession becomes
[1:01:35] positive. Amen. We begin to confess what
[1:01:37] God has said about us. I mean, we just
[1:01:40] repeat back what he's already said about
[1:01:41] you. Amen. Hallelujah. This is this is
[1:01:43] why I came to this scripture here in
[1:01:45] Zephania. I'll start it from the
[1:01:46] beginning again cuz I like it. Sing, oh
[1:01:48] daughter of Zion. Shout, O Israel. Be
[1:01:51] glad and rejoice with all the heart, O
[1:01:53] daughters of Jerusalem. The Lord hath
[1:01:55] taken away thy judgments.
[1:01:57] Amen. When did he do that? That day on
[1:01:59] Calvary, the judgment you should have
[1:02:00] received, he took upon himself. Amen. He
[1:02:03] went to hell so you don't have to go to
[1:02:04] hell. Amen. He carried your sins away
[1:02:06] that you don't have to carry none of
[1:02:07] them. Amen. He carried them far away.
[1:02:10] Amen. And the wrath of God that we
[1:02:11] should have received, he gladly took on
[1:02:13] Calvary to fulfill the God the the the
[1:02:16] law of God. Amen. He has cast out thy
[1:02:19] enemy. Hallelujah. And has cast out that
[1:02:22] enemy. You got to realize, no, your
[1:02:24] enemy doesn't belong where you are. He's
[1:02:25] been cast out by almighty God.
[1:02:28] Hallelujah. Amen. The king of Israel,
[1:02:29] even the Lord is in the midst of thee.
[1:02:31] And thou shalt thou shalt not see evil
[1:02:34] anymore.
[1:02:36] Amen. Now, we shall see. No, we're not
[1:02:38] going to see evil. You say, "Well, what
[1:02:39] about this world?" That's not what he's
[1:02:41] talking about to me. Uh to me, that's
[1:02:43] what he's talking about is what is what
[1:02:44] is on the inside of you. I got joy like
[1:02:47] a fountain. I got peace like a river. I
[1:02:49] got the righteousness of God. Amen. I've
[1:02:51] got his robe of righteousness. I've
[1:02:53] Hallelujah. I've got his salvation. I
[1:02:55] mean, I've been anointed with the oil of
[1:02:57] gladness in spite of whatever's going on
[1:02:59] in my life. Amen. God has equipped me
[1:03:01] with joy and peace and everlasting life.
[1:03:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. In that day it
[1:03:08] shall be said to Jerusalem, "Fear thou
[1:03:09] not and to Zion. Let not thy hand be
[1:03:12] slack." Amen. Fear not. Hallelujah. The
[1:03:16] Lord thy God is in the midst of in the
[1:03:17] midst of thee is mighty. He will save.
[1:03:20] He will rejoice over thee with joy. This
[1:03:23] is this is how God feels when he thinks
[1:03:25] of you. You think about a certain person
[1:03:27] and emotion comes up. When you think of
[1:03:29] your family, your spouse should be a
[1:03:30] great well of love gushing forth. Amen.
[1:03:33] Why? And and this is what he feels when
[1:03:35] he thinks about you. I mean, he's not
[1:03:37] he's not uh embarrassed by you. Even on
[1:03:40] our worst day, he ain't embarrassed.
[1:03:43] Amen. We are his workmanship. I just
[1:03:45] want to ask you a question. Does God
[1:03:46] ever do a a a a bad job? Does God ever
[1:03:50] cut any corners? Does God ever do half a
[1:03:53] project and throw up his hands and do
[1:03:55] something else? No. What he starts, he
[1:03:57] completes. And what he does is perfect
[1:04:00] and it stands forever. Amen. It's not a
[1:04:02] patchup job. is not a bit of sticky tape
[1:04:04] around it hoping it will hold together.
[1:04:06] No, he transforms us. He makes us in his
[1:04:08] image. Amen. And what he makes is
[1:04:10] perfect and nothing can stand against it
[1:04:12] that can destroy it. No, it will stand
[1:04:15] for eternity. It will stand. Hallelujah.
[1:04:18] Amen. So he rejoices over you. Amen.
[1:04:20] With joy. Amen. He will rest in his love
[1:04:23] and he will joy over thee with singing.
[1:04:25] Our God likes to sing. And it ain't a
[1:04:28] funeral march. That's for sure. That's
[1:04:31] victory is mine. Amen. She is my
[1:04:33] greatest achievement. Hallelujah. Her he
[1:04:37] will joy over thee. Look at my beloved.
[1:04:40] She's spotless. She's perfect. She's
[1:04:42] immaculate. There's none like her in all
[1:04:44] of creation. You can search from one
[1:04:46] side of the universe to the other. Every
[1:04:48] dimension, there's nothing like the
[1:04:49] redeemed of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:04:53] I'm just telling you what God says about
[1:04:55] you. Amen. If if there's any other voice
[1:04:58] in your mind that says anything less
[1:05:00] than this about you, it's the devil.
[1:05:02] Have nothing to do with that voice. You
[1:05:04] put this on your fridge or put it
[1:05:05] wherever and you say, "Lord, this is
[1:05:06] what you've said about me. I'm going to
[1:05:08] respond in kind." Amen. He's my joy.
[1:05:11] He's my strength. He's my everything.
[1:05:13] And Lord, I'll rejoice in you. Amen. Cuz
[1:05:16] God, you're my God and you love me.
[1:05:18] Hallelujah.
[1:05:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:23] Amen. I got one more. For as a young man
[1:05:26] marrith a virgin, so shall thy sons
[1:05:28] marry thee. And as the bridegroom
[1:05:30] rejoicth over the bride, so shall thy
[1:05:32] God rejoice over thee. I mean, there's
[1:05:34] nothing like a newlywed couple. Amen.
[1:05:37] They're finally they're married. They're
[1:05:38] one. Amen. The expectation we're going
[1:05:40] to create a life together. Create a
[1:05:42] future together. We're going to be one.
[1:05:43] No more separated. Amen. No more twain.
[1:05:45] No more distance between us, but we're
[1:05:47] one. And body, soul, and spirit. We're
[1:05:49] completely one. That's that joy. Amen.
[1:05:52] That's that's how the Lord rejoices over
[1:05:54] thee. Amen. I've been longing for you
[1:05:56] for years. Amen. I've been planning our
[1:05:58] life together and coming together. I've
[1:05:59] wooed you with my word. Amen. Why? It's
[1:06:02] three pulls. You say it's actually three
[1:06:05] woos. He's wooed you to his side. It's
[1:06:08] not woes. Very different. The world is
[1:06:11] up for its third woe. But we are
[1:06:14] experiencing the third pull. He has
[1:06:17] pulled. It's not a push. It's not a
[1:06:19] woman, you better shape up and cook me
[1:06:21] some eggs and if you don't do this,
[1:06:22] you're out. That's nothing like that.
[1:06:25] God, don't talk that kind of a language.
[1:06:27] That's a religious spirit trying to make
[1:06:28] them servants. Amen. But sons are made
[1:06:31] in such a way. Amen. By the love of God
[1:06:33] pulling them. Amen. Stand by my side.
[1:06:36] You belong with me. I belong with you.
[1:06:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's how he
[1:06:40] rejoices.
[1:06:42] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:46] Praise the Lord. Do you believe it?
[1:06:50] So that's why I was h the musicians
[1:06:52] tonight. Please, actually, because I
[1:06:53] just want to leave it there, but I want
[1:06:54] to ask you the question. Is that a real
[1:06:56] to you? I trust it's real to you.
[1:06:59] Everyone here who's watching, I trust
[1:07:02] you don't have a servant mentality of
[1:07:06] have I done enough for God to rejoice
[1:07:08] over me?
[1:07:10] Have I earned that position?
[1:07:13] Have I, you know, have I done enough?
[1:07:16] That's a servant mentality.
[1:07:19] You know, you see God anoint someone and
[1:07:21] and God and you know, they just shout
[1:07:22] and scream and have a Jubilee time and
[1:07:24] you get jealous of that person. That's a
[1:07:26] servantthood.
[1:07:28] Sons are not We start off as servants,
[1:07:31] but we end up as we're sons in servant
[1:07:34] position, then we come into sunship. God
[1:07:38] wants us as sons.
[1:07:40] So, how's your heart today?
[1:07:42] You trying to earn something? Lord, if I
[1:07:45] just do this, then this will happen.
[1:07:46] this or you just surrendered loving him
[1:07:49] that when you're alone by yourself,
[1:07:51] there's a peace like the river, joy like
[1:07:53] a fountain. You're not afraid of missing
[1:07:56] the rapture cuz you're part of him. He's
[1:07:59] told you again and again and again
[1:08:02] through his word, through songs, through
[1:08:03] preaching, through experience. You're
[1:08:06] mine. You're mine, my beloved.
[1:08:09] Hallelujah. And we're going to enjoy a
[1:08:11] thousand-y year honeymoon soon. Amen.
[1:08:13] And then we're going to throw the devil
[1:08:14] into the lake of fire. And then we're
[1:08:16] going to roll on to eternity. I'm going
[1:08:18] to I'm going to I'm going to remodel.
[1:08:19] I'm going to transform the earth that
[1:08:20] it's fit for you and I to dwell in. And
[1:08:23] eternity is going to roll on. And we're
[1:08:25] going to rejoice and we're going to
[1:08:27] dance and we're going to give glory and
[1:08:29] be thankful and just enjoy each other.
[1:08:31] Amen.
[1:08:33] This is the God I know. I pray it's the
[1:08:36] same for everyone
[1:08:38] that we are sons as sons,
[1:08:42] not sons as servants.
[1:08:45] Amen. Let's stand tonight.
[1:08:48] [Applause]
[1:08:52] Amen.
[1:08:54] Amen. I want to sing this song. I'm no
[1:08:56] longer a slave to fear. I'm no longer a
[1:08:59] servant. God's done a work. Glory. I'm a
[1:09:04] son. I'm his child. I'm part of him. His
[1:09:08] life flows through my life. It's no
[1:09:10] longer me. It's no longer I that liveth,
[1:09:12] but Christ that liveth in me. Amen.
[1:09:14] Deities a tabernacled in flesh living
[1:09:17] himself out. We're going to go into that
[1:09:19] on Sunday. Amen. But our God is good.
[1:09:22] Amen. Took us from servantthood. You
[1:09:24] don't need to earn anything. It's not
[1:09:25] about a job description. No, you're part
[1:09:27] of me. You're part of the family.
[1:09:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just worship the
[1:09:32] Lord tonight, shall we? Amen. Let's just
[1:09:34] sing this.

[1:09:50] a song
[1:09:54] of deliverance
[1:09:58] from my enemy. Peace
[1:10:03] till all my fears
[1:10:07] are gone.
[1:10:10] Amen.
[1:10:11] I'm no longer
[1:10:14] a slave
[1:10:16] to fear.
[1:10:20] For I am a child
[1:10:25] of God.

[1:10:34] to fear.

[1:10:42] of God
[1:10:46] from eternity.
