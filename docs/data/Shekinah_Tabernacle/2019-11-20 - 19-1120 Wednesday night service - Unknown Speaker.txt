mister musicians it's wonderful atmosphere that's so good to be in the house of the Lord just got a little thought for tonight and have you could put my slideshow up I didn't I don't really know what to call my message because it changed so much as I was thinking about it so I stuck with my original thought that I don't really kind of follow the theme that phrase got I love it when you go on a journey when you're reading the Bible so you go in your Bibles to first Corinthians 13 verse 8 and this is a scripture that I've taken deep note I've ever since we first become Christians and never really felt that I fully understood the context of the scripture and it's just one of those ones you know you just put on the side and one day the Lord will open it up to me in a slightly different way than maybe I've seen it before and so I was just following as leading so maybe it'll be a bit of a study denied that to see what the Lord's got for us 1st Corinthians 13:8 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away up all stars and the next verse here he's adding a parable to this first so that would catch what he's saying when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall be known also even as also I am known let's just pray dear Heavenly Father lord I just pray father you just take this little little thought that I've put together Lord that you've put together Lord and just how Express it's of the people Lord for the servants just not you that's just not worthy Lord Jesus to bring forth your word Lord but just help us to get out of it out of the way Lord and just channel down Lord Jesus we want to hear from you tonight Lord we don't we're not here to hear from a man Lord Jesus father I just pray you take control of this service and I just say I love you Lord Jesus we thank you in Jesus name Amen can be seated so I just want to go through a few quotes because somebody asked brother Branham about this verse verse team in so I've I've got control and questions and answers please explain first Corinthians 13:8 212 now that the perfect word is restored to the church are these verses fulfilled now I think I just went through that didn't I and when that which is a perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with Paul said though I speak with tongues of men and angels and do all these things here but when that which is perfect is cut now as there anything perfect that God no sir as God the perfect and the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the words still God see all right when that which is perfect as can that which is impart has done away with and one thing that we tend to do and we shouldn't do a separate God in the word because God is his word and the word is God but often through just how we think as human beings it's easy to get next up and separate God in his word so he he was talking about this this verse a bit through this message but he had very broken up and so does a couple other places he talks about it I like how he says it Paul said though I speak with tongues of men and angels though I gave my body to be burned as sacrifice though I understand all the mysteries of the word though I give all my goods to the poor and all these things and have not charity I am still nothing I have faith that I can move mountains and so forth I'm still nothing been he said that which is in part shall be done away with when that which is perfect as come or when that which is perfect as made known now I've got a question on that I hope to get to tonight about what happened when the seals over and I think I'll get to that right here on this question so now he's saying when that which is perfect is made known now has has that which has the perfect Word of God being made known to the church amen that has been pick up one other spot he talks about it in this message first Corinthians 13 says this when there which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a cat trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication then that witches impart has done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became the man I put away childish things Amen I go to preaching and I don't get to these things so that which is perfect is come we've had the divine vindication revealed word come to us and you know people might say oh yes I see this in other people I don't see it I don't see it because this is something that takes place personally with you and if Jesus has come forth with a book and he's calling names and go praise God I heard him call my name someone else is I didn't hear him call your name him call your name what about when he came to Abraham and at this stage he comes and he calls an Abraham that Abraham was Abram he had just had his name changed but God knew his name was Abraham he was calling him by his new identity and so now when you hear the call when you hear God when you hear God calling you he doesn't call come and call you and say Andy cliff had come forth he reveals to you that your name's mrs. Jesus Christ when you hear him call your name this is Jesus Christ you feel him calling is making himself known to you personally because he's come forth to redeem those names that were written in the book and if he's come forth to a Dean ordered us to redeem that means to come and pick up something that was at a place somewhere to begin with and it got lost it somehow got separated from that original place and now he's going to redeem it back and bring it back to that place where it originally was so now he's only come to redeem those people that were originally there amen so he said in verse 9 for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with so that leaves us with a pretty serious question what what part is to be done away with if something's going to be done away with and we know with the opening of the word that we're now transitioning there's something taking place and under people because we have to be prepared for a body change so there's something taking place in this space of time that we're living in right now and I'm not very good at making up charts and I didn't want to plagiarize another minister so I sort of made a rough little chart but we know brother Branham taught that Jesus comes in three different sons names when he come and he was a prophet on earth he come in the name of the son of man he was a son of men he said who do they say I the son and their name and it was a prophetic ministry and then when he comes through the church ages as the Holy Ghost he was known as the son of God but then in the Millennium he comes as a son of David that's why the Jews must and because they were looking for the son of David they were looking for this King that was going to take over the world and role when they missed him because they were looking for son of David but we know revelation 10 7 what's happening as a son of man again was being revealed at the end time so he had to come back again as a son of man and something was happening in this transitioning time because when I can really see that so in 1963 when the word come open now the perfect interpretation of the word was coming made known to the church now you were responsible because when some links made no it's like a child when it when it's done something wrong it comes to a certain age and it knows that it's done something wrong now it becomes accountable and that's what's happening with the word that progressed and progressed through the Pentecostal age but it comes with a point in time where the word was fully made known and now the church has to become responsible for what's been revealed to the church because these are people that have been pulled out of Laodicea Laodicea church is not going in a rapture but he's pulling people out of the Laodicea Church to go into a rapture so now we find ourself in this you know brother Brannon use many tombs to express it but we were in this little breach of time between their church age period which was the church being led by man and the Millennium so brother Brennan said bride age astronaut age word age Eagle age all these different things this little space of time that the bride's getting ready and I find it interesting that brother Brandon when he's preaching the seals he takes the first six seals first six nights one after another the it's right that preaches the sixth seal and then he has a gap before he brings a seventh seal he brings questions and answers he would have thought the seventh seal would come straight on the seal of nine but he brings us get because he's a gap in God's great plan and then he brings a seventh co on the eighth night and you find the same thing in the book of in the book of Revelation through Chapter six first six seals all in a row then something else is taking place and Chapter seven there's a gap and then brings forth the seventh seal again in Chapter 8 we find ourselves in a small space of time where God has redeemed has chosen church out of layer to see it bringing her to a higher calling there's something taking place and if you're not paying attention you're missing what you've got to recognize is that the church has not been led by a man Church has been led by men for a long time thousands of years he's been led by men but we're not in that dispensation now we've been led by the Holy Ghost and that's why brother brother Branham was pointing us to Christ that's why he had to go off the scene just as John the Baptist said he must increase and I must decrease as a brother Brennan continued as ministry on people would have just kept following brother Branham oh you've got to stop looking at a man you're not going to be known by the church who attended when you were on earth you're not going to be known are you you know well if I just go to Shekinah Tabernacle you know I'll be safe so I would definitely make the rapture just won't work like that but we find that we're loving under an anointing bad and win ting that people feel that if they can just follow a certain ministry then they'll be saved you can come and follow brother bin but brother beans pointing you to Jesus Christ and if you only follow him and don't follow the one he's looking to it doesn't make any difference at all it doesn't matter how big the ministers putting on the whole armor of God just like the word in the beginning was spoken to us in the Garden of Eden spoken word and the second time was made flesh and dwelt among us and the third time that become a part of us when the Holy Ghost welling in us God coming into the man first spoke the word Adam the enemy tore it down then the word was made flesh Jesus and he was crucified but now I mean there's a difference in the word the word has become the church and the church as the word to God all that God was he poured into Christ all Christ was he poured into the church the Holy Ghost we've got to become one with this word we've got to become a part of it we've got to look into what we're going to put it on there's something different about this age than any other age we have a privilege that no other age has had you know brother Branham like talking about guns to explain things and so I like I just like this little example and maybe if you don't understand again you might not understand it but the gun has a breech in it so you can be walking around with this gun and it has a magazine and it's got seven bullets and that magazine and the bolts close because for this time of this church age period there's been a lid on on Revelation but it's and because Christ has come back to redeem our people when that bolt comes forward and the gun picks up a bullet that's sitting in that magazine and it pops it that bullet pops out of the magazine and it slides into the breech of the gun and now that gun that bolt goes down that bullet can't come out it's in a safe place and now that guns dangerous because all it would take is the pulling of that trigger and that that bullets going to leave the barrel but at the moment it's in the breech has been pulled up out of the church ages it's sitting there and it's loaded and it's ready to go and the moment and the twinkling of an eye when the master of that gun pulls that trigger gone and no one even knows but it's it's in a different place it's not studying with the other six even bullets here it's being pulled up out of it so now sitting in a higher place so I believe that we've come to this point in time where it's the ending of the church ages and God is pulling the church out sometimes it just feels like we're just everything's coming so much like and the curtain that separates us from this other dimension this this heaven you know it feels like it's just so thin that you could just climb through it and just dance around the throne and it's just so close but something has to be done away with God's not pulling a church pulling a people out there are just walking a partial walk with the Lord so this words been fully opened and it says and it says that Christ is not three different people and then you go oh I jumped just as much as you I shout just as much as you we pray for the second they get healed but you know we we see God's three gods it doesn't matter as partial revelation that's been done away with now in the Pentecostal age that was fine that was Pentecostal revelation God was pulling a church out of people that had a partial understanding of the word but now his word has been known and you're responsible for it you have to walk with God and that's why all these books won't work books are not gonna do it you know Irvine just lived by the co D book will be like this perfect message people and and we'll make it that won't do it you know you see so many books these days seven steps to seven steps to health seven steps of us I'm sure there's bound to be one Road and seven steps to a rapture but I can tell you right now that it's not going to work because this is something that's taking place between you and God personally yes only you know there's one book that you can read outside of the Bible and outside of the message there's one book that you can read will point you towards the rapture and that is it you you you are written epistles and men identification did you ever think he never wrote a book when he was on earth as far as we know he never wrote at one time that was on this sand then erased it out probably afterwards why didn't he write a word because he was the word see he left the word we don't need so many books when you become a written epistle of God see that's what God wants you to be images of him amen now that perfect word has come the only ones that are going to go on a rapture are the ones that become one with that perfect word so I want to read through a story and first kings and I've got it up on the slide so you don't have to turn there this was quite an amazing story when you begin to break it down and look at this I thought I made that bigger anyway then came there to woman that were harlots I considered this I thought you know before we become one with Christ we were acting as harlots - because we were a spouse to Christ but yet we were fornicating with the world but something changed but in this story there came two young woman that were harlots and to the King and stood before him and the one woman said oh my lord iron this woman dwell in one house and I was delivered of child with her in the house and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered that this woman was delivered also then we were together there was no stranger with us in the house say if we - in the house now we find sometimes when this word comes to you well as birthing in you that's like a baby coming forth in you and sometimes it doesn't just come to you you know like when witness would come to me I was sitting in a house drunk stone ecstasy pee everything I was absolutely totally out of my mind at four o'clock in the morning and something played on TV and it showed God's creation at numbers - this wasted person at four o'clock in the morning that was an atheist and hated Christians now I was sitting there with my flatmate and something touched me and tears were streaming down my face and he saw he saw it too he saw it too we talked about it but something happened there was a reason something hated that the word didn't come forth in him he didn't nurse the word when a baby's coming forth it has to be nursed so it says here in verse 19 and this woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it and the most dangerous time in your walk as when this child's being birthed than you now you can be you can be in the message Church for I don't hundred years not that you would have because it hasn't been open for a hundred years this trial when this child comes forth it can happen right now it could be happening tonight and it becomes a very dangerous time in your walk because Satan wants to come in and get that child Wallace young that's why we're doing this University work because that's where the devil wants to come in and gets those children why they're easy to manipulate but as a dangerous time and this woman she didn't care for her baby she didn't she wasn't aware of this child that she had and she just overlaid it and smother she didn't take it seriously and the other woman's are where am i sorry verse 20 and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while they had made sleep and laid it in her bosom and laid the D child in my bosom and when I rose in when I rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead when I had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which I did be so now we see this foolish woman that smothered the life out of her baby and you've seen it in this church where people have smothered the life out of a out of a booth that was coming forth and they ended up with a dead child and now they they found that they weren't satisfied with this dear child so now they come back to you go ahead my dear child honor take your live child so they come back in other semesters as a cult that's fake it's false and they want to give you the deed child and then you you you you pick up this what they're saying oh yeah well okay I consider it and then you've got this ditch hold and you go I consider as this is not my child this is not my child I had a living child take your dead child back I don't want your dead child and the other woman seen a but the living is my son and the deed is thy son and this said no but the deed is thy son and the living is my son thus they spake before the king and the King said the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is dead and the other saith neighbor thy son has did in my son is a living so now this is argument going on between these these two woman you know and we're never gonna win anybody over by arguing and fighting if someone can't accept the word and arguments not going to make them accept the word but there is something that will that will tell what's true I think God this something that will tell what's true and I like this okay that wasn't all supposed to come that bore 24 and the King said bring me a sword and they brought a sword before the King because there's a sword that came down in this age into the hand of a prophet and that sword will now tell which was true the sword hallelujah the Kings sword as quicken it sharp and it will get to the bottom of any problem we have today verse 25 and the King said divide the living child and two and give half to the one and half to the other be inspect the woman who's the living child was unto the king for a bowels ye and upon her son and she said o my lord give her the living child and a know why Slayer but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divided the king answered and said get through the living child and no wife Slayer she's the mother there off this bride's not going to take a half slain job I'm not going to take half a revelation I'm not going to take partial word either give me the full revelation of Jesus Christ or give me nothing but don't slay the word problem is these people that are willing to take a better brother means brother and Brennan's message here but you know I don't like the whole skirts thing you know but but when He healed the sick that was pretty good you're just having a slain child you're willing to have your child cut in half no sir I'm not happy with 1/2 cut up child it's too many people that even now will stand and preach this message but they're too cowardly to preach the truth we've got to stand forth with this message and bring it forth in its purity you can't get by by a passage message and the message that martin luther brought of justification that was a right for Luther's age that's as far as a twin sanctification was flown in Wesley's ages as far as a twin then we come into the Pentecostal age and the restoration of the gifts a very fine thing that was fine in the age but we're going beyond that now we are beyond that just as sure as there as a world we've gotta come beyond this thing because we have done the same thing that they did with it before make an idol out of it I belong to this church I belong to this order of it that order of it God will send somebody that will smash that thing and tear it to pieces and confirm his word the forward praise be to God now we see that that is true God rich in His mercy so God has made away God has made away for you to go in the rapture even though this partial revelations going to be done away with he's made away he never left his people without a way and he's never going to leave you without a way if there's one thing we need to recognize is that the pillar of fire that appeared and the desert the pillar of fire that appeared in brother branham's ministry it appears here in every single service and it's more than able to lead this church it's more than able to lead you you know so often we judge a man by his stature and a preacher you know I find it funny you know we can get so caught up in the way someone preaches you know I hope in your brother nd doesn't learn but you can watch brother end in you then they must have to replace the carpet in that church you know you miss the whole point of what the ministers saying I love the way that brother bang can get every one fired up now I love it too but you at that's all that you take out of the service you miss it you must see because God can speak through on us and tell he can tell anybody you know he does doesn't it God does not favor a man the greatest move of God that comes since Jesus Christ come through a little poor ragged little Kentucky boy biggest move don't look at the vessel its vessel has nothing to do with it but it's an man's nature to want some big respectable giant the guy with the biggest name just go to the biggest church that'll do it's not going to work it's the same thing that Azrael wanted it's what kept them out of the promised land you know Oh Moses you're not the only Holy One in Israel Oh what if we just have a if we just have a law if we just have the you know if we just take the co D book if we just have the law that'll do no I know and we're not happy with that or there'll be another men you know and we'll let search out the best man it doesn't matter look to the pillar of fire be a blessing or else only a couple of days away and then mercy a blessing for all that time forty years I don't want us to join in the desert but you know when someone's been in bondage for so long it's very hard to break free and I often I really like the story that brother Brennan told about the eagle he goes to the zoo and he sees this eagle locked in a cage and it disgusts him because he's a man of the wilderness and he likes to see things free he likes to see nature and its freedom and he goes to the zoo and this Eagles in there and this Eagles a heavenly bird it's not it's not supposed to be locked up and it's beating its head against the cage and us that's probably breaking its beak on there on the wires and scratching its claws up in its unhappy then it's bleeding and he just he can't be the thought of us Eagle in this cage and it's doing something in and he's getting upset he said he said have I had had a had the money I would have just paid the zoo to let me take take that Eagle away and it's so true not just in that we've seen it even we had a dog and then that dog grew up going for long walks I used to bike whether I think a living Ches every morning and then we moved out to the farm and he had the roam of the whole farm and it was just a happy happy dog but then we moved into a little Township and in a rental and he couldn't be inside then he had to be in a cage and through the summer that's all right because you go for lots of walks but then in the winter and it's dark and it's cold and the first winter you know it started to change his character as countenance just started to go a bit down and and that's what happens to a man you know when he's just been in a locked up for a bit long you know he used to be free but it's just a spirit come in or something and it's just started to sort of close them in a little button and it just started a Rob a bit of that joy coming forth and then the next summer year that was all right and we come to that next winter we're coming of a fair way through that winter and he's getting a bit unhappy we know he's unhappy and the next thing we hear this horrible noise that neither of us will either want to hear again and he's something snaps because he's been locked up for too long and he's trying to chew his way out of steel bars all the teeth are gone just just completely lost it because it's just what happens to a man and then you go oh I've just been there's no victory in your life you come to a place where you're so locked up so bound and there's just no joy in your life because you've been so bound up by the enemy and it's sad that's a very very sad space to be in brother branham see there's only one thing I've seen that sadder than that Eagle locked in that cage and it's to see a man locked up and bound up he tells us other story about Johnny crow he said Johnny crow you know he had been tied with a little cord around his leg for a long long time and all the other birds would fly down and that eat some grain with Johnny crow and then and he'd be happy he'd eat grain with him but then that all fly off and he'd go and he he couldn't go because his foot was tied and this went on for quite a long time and then after a while someone come in there and they cut that little clip off his leg they said Johnny the words open the seals have been broken you can go free Johnny well I don't know how and then all those other crows they fly away kin and I don't know how to go free I've been locked up for so long I don't know how to go free but little Johnny or C look he's standing on the edge there all he needs to do is take a ste take a step of faith and sometimes that's what it takes when you know there's something there but it just takes a step of faith you have to and you have to take that step of faith brother Andy's not going to take that step of faith for you he might pray for you but you yourself have to set your wings and fly we have to look forward beyond the Curt and this is where I'm getting to we have to look beyond what these eyes see naturally the pillar of fire is here to leave us the days of church revivals are done these big campaigns are off we just have another healing campaign like brother Brennan we're not going to that those days are over they're done the revival what the Pentecostal revival was over so now we can be guilty of thinking well there's got to be people here to be better still seed in Wellington you believe that I believe they're still sedum that will be sitting in these pews soon that's in Wellington now natural carnal man thinking let's have a big campaign we'll have a big convention right heaps of tracks and we're going to reach like we'll go sit up on the on the right at the waterfront down there in Wellington where the most people come through and we'll reach out to 20,000 people and we'll spread out that's man's thinking what are the chances that person that should be sitting in that seat right now wants to have anything to do with a message right now he probably wouldn't take a tract have you forced it to so that way of thinking is not what's going to bring the seed and then the in days but the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God and he can lead you directly to that person but we just become like a mule you know like Revelation comes to a mule no need to slide mmm yep yep but that mule will go out and or do twice that twice the work of the horse but we can become like a message mule just trying to do works to get people in the kingdom but we know who our Father is and we can say father where's that seed and then he can lead that horse he can lead you straight to where straight to where those seeds are you know you know why this work that's word coming open it brought us into a place to replace a place where we can rejoice it doesn't come to bring us into a place like say the Jehovah's Witness and you've got to go out of witness to so many people and do works that's not what the Holy Ghost came where he came to bring rest and he wants you to rest enter into his rest amen don't lead to that lean to that carnality you just you become like a man beholding his natural face in a glass and a mirror as we could say looking at me no hope brother Isaac trying to say this but he's already mentioned about a movie thing already then when I first heard this I thought no doubt brother and I shared it with me but a long time ago I thought you know that sounds like a lot of money a lot of effort what's the point you know just natural carnal man thinking you know that seems a bit over the top you know but as I begin to actually see the vision that's the problem we judge people before we understand someone we shouldn't do that we should give someone grace and the benefit of the doubt but you know if there are anything we sometimes think the only thing that we've got to do on this earth has find that last seat and we can go but there's something else that's taking place because there's lost souls that have to hear this word and that movie may just be a part of that vision where people were going to hear what the prophet that they're going to hear about a ministry we shouldn't be so quick to judge when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things so Paul's using as a parable the stature of a perfect man and I believe we're living in an age where we come to the full adoption we're coming to the fullness of what God has given to us we're not down somewhere in the feet not down somewhere in the leagues but we've come right to the head to the capstone and Christ is capping the church for now we see through a glass darkly so Paul's talking about his dispensation when I was a child for for now we see through a glass darkly but then when but then when when he becomes men but then we see then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known now that just gets me a little bit excited because I want to come back to know what on how I'm known because there's a picture of me that when I look in a natural mirror and I see that image that's not me that's that's not me my image is beyond that and it's something far more glorious than that and I want to see that I want to see their image because you know when I can see that image then I can truly say I'm a chosen generation called forth the show has excellence all that I require for life God has given me not a Maserati and a super yacht amen not a million dollars and a bunch of Max Factor that's not what I require for life he's given me the Holy Ghost and I know who I am and I know who God says I am and what he says I am amen praise God when you can behold their image when you can see their image of yourself then you will be able to say I can overcome why can I overcome because I see their image there I've already overcome I've already overcome what do you mean oh I'm you're struggling I'm not struggling like this is the image of me I'm not struggling I'm not sick I'm already healed hallelujah that image will change you I like that photo that's not what I was looking for though identification now he was God's Word expressed and he said now if you can believe me see it believe the works that I do search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and that's the very thing that tells Who I am oh I wonder if see that's the one who sees Who I am the Scriptures tell who I am and let me take that a little further will you the Scriptures is what tells what you are that expresses you and me and expresses me the Scriptures tell what we are that's so loud that our voice cannot even be heard our life speaks louder than our voice and it's God's way of letting us see what we are amen we need to behold a different image than the image we see in the mirror you know brother Phil was telling me something last week and I was like praise God if you knew what I was planning on preaching on you you would understand this so he's telling me you know he's been on a CC as it I flavor this foot and he broke his foot a while ago and now the image of his leg is not what it used to be it doesn't look that like it should do so he told me what I do is I take another mirror and I set that mirror there next to my leg and then I look at that mirror and I see the image of my other leg and then I just sit there and I look at that and it's wrecking my brain and to seeing the image of my good league I don't see a bang league when I look at it I see a good league because I'm looking at the image of the sleep if you can do the same thing with the word it will change these atoms amen if you're sick and you can look into this word for so long I don't see the sickness I see what the scripture says about my sickness I will change you it will do something hallelujah I love that song but Andy wrote and sung and Men when you were singing it I'll say he's I said to him I got a quote that you'll like now back in the Philadelphian age the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh what great loved that age manifested for him it reminds me of those beautiful words of first Peter 1:8 whom having not seen you love and whom though now you see him not yet believing he rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory with him we rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt we know him as much as our limiting senses can lead us but one day it will be face to face that is for this age he's coming at the end of this age partial realizations will be made perfect realization complete realization hallelujah we've been looking through a glass darkly but soon that will be face to face we've been going from glory to glory but soon we'll be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him wondrously like him Jesus our Savior divine isn't that wonderful we're completing him that is true he would not lie to us about that you know praise God I believe that's what that's really where we are we have a perfect realization of this word but what I like what he says here but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will be all swallowed up in life then we will realize realization hallelujah no we can sing and shout now like we're dancing around the throne our heavens coming down I feel it and all this but one day we're actually going to realize what we realize now hallelujah amen you know hot I'm gonna realize though I confessed my foot was healed and I confessed are gonna get there and I realized my foots healed though I confessed on earth that my diabetes was gone I'm gonna get there and I realize that was never there to begin with though I confess to Jesus all my sins are gone and I get there I'm gonna realize I never had any sin in the first place hallelujah and then how can anybody sit here and condemn us and tell us to sit down and be quiet condemn you of emotion brother Ben don't let these people stand up and Church try to stop me try stop brother handy amen it's not gonna happen there's something bubbling inside of me that's not me what happened when the spies went into Canaan's Len they came back and they said yep there's a land their land land was promised to us but there's like these giant sea it is you know such and such preacher with such a big name and he said that it's this way and he said that we can't take the land just yet we just have to wait a while and there's such and such a church here and then they do they don't agree with this one but they say that we need to do this or such-and-such I praise God that there were two young men near that said well oh you guys saw were the Giants all I saw was milk all I saw was honey all I saw were grapes like this you try stop me from taking that land hallelujah God's already said I can take the land amen we have witnesses in here today and this church that at the entered that land that have seen beyond that curtain and they've seen all those fruits and they go you know what that lands mine that promises mine that fruit is my and try stop me you try stop me you try telling me to be quiet it's not going to work I'm gonna shout and say hit me in anyway you know I was laughing about it I was thinking about that woman brother Brennan was telling a story and some some young girl that got married and was going to this her husband's Church some maybe Methodist Church and mum had been reading the Bible quite a button she was seeing yourself in those scriptures and the preacher said something well Jesus is God but you guys hallelujah amen you know what happened every Nick in that church went there goes brother Andy again something was taking place because she found herself and this word and when you find yourself in this word there'll be something and you just go I just can't I just can't hold it end is something that's been expressed and I can't stop it it's bubbling hallelujah when I look into that word and I look not at their natural image that I see it in the mirror in the glass and I'm not looking directly but looking face to face I see a glorious church without spot or wrinkle she's dancing she's singing blessing and honor and praise and she's rejoicing around the throne I don't see a trodden down cassock Church their image is not there what do you see you know we've come too far to turn back we've come too far in this journey with God to turn there and you know what happens if you turn back you turn into a pillar of salt right and you know what salt does it draws all the life out of you and I want to dehydrate my fishing bait so it'll it'll preserve it won't change at all anymore I cover it in salt and it sucks all the moisture sucks all the life out of it and then it just stays stagnant that's a bit of Bates finish it's just going to stay there never turn back we've got to keep pressing for there's no where else are you going to go you know like brother Ben was saying to me when when these people come at you and they say the message is false yeah oh yeah so what have you got for me that's better what have you got that's going to lead me any further with Christ because this message regardless I'm following Christ and I want to follow him closer every every day day by day so you bring me something that'll lead me closer to my Savior I'll follow you but until you do that I'm gonna stick with this because this is serving me pretty good at the moment amen that's what happened to people when they leave this message they turn into a pillar of salt they turned back and it just draws all the life out of you I wasn't gonna go to this but I couldn't seem to get it out of my nose for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the good Word of God and the powers of the world to come if they should fall away to renew again unto repentance seeing they crucify themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame if there's one thing that I do not want to be guilty of on this day it is crucifying Jesus Christ for the second time it was not a nice thing when he had to be crucified the first time now he's come forth to redeem of people he's hid his own blood ease and the whole everything coming to an end and his words open and then people were still willing to crucify him they don't feel that they need him I don't want to be guilty of that you know what happens people come into the message and they sweep this house by good works you know they just see the doctrine or you know I've come the pants and Longos here and they just start doing the works that outward works but they don't let Christ come in and be king of your life so what happens that devil that you swept out by works he goes and finds seven friends and he comes back in and because you don't let Jesus become king of your life to rule and lead you then that Devil comes back with more Devils and then it's even harder than it was in the first place we've got to protect this vessel while we're on earth because this part of our journey this this man this this part has not converted you that's still subject to Laodicea though my soul has already taken a rapture and has sitting in heavenly places with Christ this guy this silly silly guy is still subject still subject to Laodicea and we've got to watch it at every point because it will deceive you you know what that is a stagnant water and that's why you know you can become stagnant in your Christian walk even you've seen this words open but you just sort of been cruising for a while you know haven't really made any ground lately haven't claimed anything in and and you're like oh well it's just Church you know it's Sunday again you know I've been Monday tomorrow and you know we'll carry on with life and you just there's no joy he becomes stagnant and you know what happens in stagnant water it becomes a place for like all this pesky life to come you know stuff that stings and bites and stinks have you drink from that water you'll probably die you know it's not a place where you want to come in your question what you got to keep pressing forth higher each day there's a higher calling for you I mean looking to their unseen image of yourself don't become like a man beholding as natural face in the glass and you press them to that real image of the word put on those scriptures I want when people see me I want them to behold Jesus Christ because you're supposed to be a reflection of this word so why don't we start looking and really putting on Jesus Christ amen take back what the enemy's taken from you and declare your token Satan this is my token this is my token this has got the answer for everything that I need in life if you need healing this is your token if you want to be in a rapture this is your token everything that you have need of in life this is your token devil I've got my token back off I'm taking back my land let me just finish with one quote and we'll have the musicians Lord let me let Bible readers here tonight see the truth let them see that malachi for that this anointing is supposed to come and restore back again in the faith that the fathers won't see the revelation of God in Christ now may they see the revelation of God and human beings Christ manifested in the flesh of his church walking among us groans at Lord the promises you made and the promises you will keep and I commit myself with the word and with the church with all to you now in Jesus Christ's name Amen musicians where you come catch that revelation that Christ is walking in his church by you putting on the word you become manifestations of this Bible people won't read this Bible do you know how many people that I have tried to give tracts to that I've tried to give stuff they weren't read it but do you know how many times people have said oh you know there's something different about you a guy come up to me and he said guys you're a Christian aren't you I'd only meet the guy for five minutes I said oh how did you know that he didn't know me long enough to know my life is just something about you and that's how it should be with you it should be that when the world sees you they see something different about you know they might not want to take this off you but life brother Ben was preaching it on Sunday and then that was a good service I just wanted to climb through that computer screen just like I want to climb through this veil and to my theophany oh boy anyway I lost my thought I had a song where I was going to sing to be like Jesus let's stand [Music] to be like Jesus to be light ha-ah [Music] [Music] to to be like gee is to ooh Oh love Oh to

Jesus was anointed to the people father Lord that we can take something out of the Lord has to be more like you father to look beyond our natural flesh Lord Jesus hallelujah Lord let us see the real

of faith this week when we go out I just pray that you'll just take the Lord with you and know that we all have the same enemy and by His grace he is defeated Amen thank you brother James wonderful Maci's god bless you I always keep just doing the work amen thank you so much can we just final song can we sing it's bubbling amen cuz it's bubbling amen d we wanna sing it it's bubbling in my soul

know if I know that well I'll give it a go away I know [Music] [Music] [Applause] chosen generation Oh I know [Music] I don't know [Music] the truth [Music] what he says [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] and you walk in each flight a favor that means you walk where he wants you to be okay I may never do that amen I'll tell you a testimony before we go if you can play it with softly in the background because it's true so when God takes you on a journey sometimes he wants to see how far you can go and how much you trust him okay so if you just trust him because you get something from him that's a wrong relationship that's a child wanting a suite from a dad and if he doesn't get his suite he's upset so God said to us to to keep on just pressing on and he puts us outside of our house and he puts us in a situation where we don't always feel comfortable because you're out of your comfort zone but see your confession the things that you say that comes out of your mouth is what God listens to okay so sometimes it might not go well in here but just speak out here confess that all as well God as house for me I will get my place in his time not in my time days the song and his time is in there do we have that in his time I think we should put that one up because if I was looking at the favor and in all the things that God gave me I would have missed this whole thing and a warrant of her trust and love and patience and meekness and kindness and all those things so remember when God sits a promise before you and it doesn't happen right then we've been out of a house for a month enough now isn't it but a month in the house all our stuff packed in storage and God said he'll give a house for us and you know what he doesn't fail anything okay and even gives us better than we expected okay because all we did is say Lord I don't know how this is going to happen we had five no six knows basically and the more the harder we tried to do applications the more he said no so we didn't know why but you know what God had a house for us so we just keep walking and brother nd God bless you for you guys are just always just think you guys are really well and everyone thank you so much and I run the Christian in the open the house for us everyone here you know that's what we have is real it's not fake this love ye and everything we have is is real okay so if you don't get your your your gift right now or your prayer right now don't worry about the favor just keep walking in his world that is God's favor for you okay so if you sing that song again and you come to the favor part just remember that's God's will not your world okay I mean I think the world betrays that song so really bad how do we start this one brother Isaac [Music] amen [Music] that's it [Music] Hey [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] you say time dancing it again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's keep that one just Thank You Lord Jesus that everything happens in your time lord I pray that the rest of this week will for every one of us be in your time Lord Jesus Lord I pray that every child of yours Lord will come in Lord brother James says you are doing the work father it's
