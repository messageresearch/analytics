TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] h [Music] for [Music] good morning how are you all this morning ready to praise the Lord amen amen the first song that um I am going to do I'm just going to change the order slightly but I'm going to take one out is um a song called my beloved I always used to wonder why Shannon enjoyed this song A few years back every time we do it she would um enjoy it and kind of enter into it and um I I you know I I just didn't think much of it I thought I was just a song it's kind of some songs you like some songs you don't they just it was just one of those ones that didn't really strike me much but it wasn't until years later that she said the reason why she liked it at a certain point in time because the don't embarrass David but David's uh David means my beloved and this is when Dave was going through his thing he was going through and you know Shannon was you know trusting in the Lord and when every time we would sing that song it was my beloved so that was I don't there I don't know why I said that [Music] [Laughter] but yeah but let's stand this morning and um but you know it's so we're not singing about David my beloved we're singing about the Lord so so just we don't worship for men what we do actually just not as a supernatural men a God man and you know that's why that's why that's why people couldn't receive Jesus because he was just a man like oh that's just Jesus From Galilee you know when I was family and you know he he they had to look Beyond the Veil of his flesh and realize that that was almighty God and if I would make it spiritual this morning we have to do the same with each other too and with the with say with the minister this morning we look past the Flesh and we we look and realize that the same God that was in Christ is the same God that's in the minister this morning and is going to speak to us it's a supernatural thing and and and the same with brother Ben and anyone that ministers and and but but also each person you know that's how I deal with each person I I see the Christ in each one of you and I don't care about any of the other stuff you know I don't care about any human stuff it's irrelevant there's a Christ in each one and that's who I always look to in each one you know that and it's the same God that was in Christ it's the same God that's in all of you and that's that's that's who God's people are they are Supernatural people and and that's why we you know we yeah we just deal very carefully with God's people we deal carefully with everybody but God's people we're dealing with God you know and and that's why Jesus when he stopped Paul on the road to aass he said us yeah when he stopped Saul he said Saul Saul why are you persecuting me and we know that it's because it was Christ that was in each one of the people he was persecuting that was what he was doing so I don't want to end up in a predicament where I'm doing harm to the Lord by how I deal with other people with other especially other believers Lord help me let's um pray this morning and just Commit This Time To The Lord I feel a nice atmosphere I think this going to be a powerful service this morning I think the Lord's really going to speak to us we need to put our spiritual thinking caps on and just receive what he has for us this morning Heavenly Father we come with reverence before you Lord knowing that that Lord you paid such a great price to redeem us Lord and and and we just have such a love and respect for you Lord and and and for your people Lord and for the the the ones that you dwell in here this morning we have such a love and respect for each other Lord and may we may we always have that esteem and that respect for each one Lord may may we look past the flesh Lord and and our our human fraes which we all have our human weaknesses our human failings Lord we we as men and women fail on a daily basis Lord we we're frail we we say the wrong things we do the wrong things Lord but we're so grateful that in US is the unfailing god Lord and each one here this morning is the the unfailing but also the perfect Christ dwells in each one Lord and that's what I see in my brethren this morning is perfection Lord because you dwell in them Lord and and we we we lord you blot out all these other things Lord when we put them under the blood all these failings we have Lord and there's just perfection Lord so that's what we look at by faith in each believer this morning Lord I see Perfection Lord because I I see Christ dwelling in us I see a redeemed a forgiven people this morning Lord and may just minister to us this morning bless the word Lord bless the songs and we just invite you here Lord to have have your free will Lord to to just work in our midst may we surrender to your spirit this

need and everything we have a need of he's aware of it this morning and we pray that he will bless us with his presence with his guidance with his love and everything we have a need of uh it's wonderful to be with you again this morning to see all the familiar faces and some new faces and uh if you don't know me my name is brother Hanes I'm a pastor of the country Tabernacle in South Africa and uh like brother Ben said we just came to visit our family in Oakland but it's always wonderful just to come to visit our other family in uh Wellington to come and uh see that all is well by the grace of the Lord so may God bless you as we bring greeting from the Saints and uh to know that the battle is heavy but the Lord is faithful he is true he has never failed us and he can never fail us and we know that by Our Own Strength we can never make it but by his grace All Things become passable we love him we appreciate him and we pray that this morning that he will grant us his grace and favor with his presence that he will take every thought and every idea into his own Mighty hand and that we will be able able to say it was good to be in the house of the Lord appreciate your pastor his family for the invitation for me to come and stand here the confidence and Trust they've put in the ministry so may God help us to uh just add a little bit value to your life not from our own inspiration but from what God has given by gifts he has placed in the church so we want to look up to him to say Lord may you just give us a special visitation may we we know that you are in control that all things are under your mighty name as we appreciate him I'm also happy to be of my precious wife sister elip God bless her you know it's wonderful to travel with your wife companion a friend love of my life so we appreciate her to travel alone is not nice but when my wife is with me I can go anywhere so uh we appreciate her God bless her amen let us turn in our Bibles thanks the musicians God bless you I thank in guanas for the lovely item this morning I had an agreement with them I said either they sing or I sing and if I sing I'm not preaching I can't do two things you know so thankfully they decided to sing but may God bless them dear friends of us um and we appreciate them sincerely this morning job 7:1 17-8 and the title this morning would be God's word giving us purpose you know God's word gives us purpose we have gathered here with the purpose this morning and God's words give us a purpose a purpose in life a purpose where there is no purpose job 7:1 17-18 the word says what is man that thou should us Magnify Him and that thou should us set thine heart upon him that thou should us visit him every morning and try him every moment amen a beautiful question we always like to refer to what is a man that thou should us Magnify Him thou should set thine heart upon him and that thou should visit him every morning and try him every moment let's just bow heads again father as we pray oh Father this morning bowing our hearts and our heads before thy throne of grace Lord we want to commit ourselves into thy hands this morning to say Lord may you take these words and thoughts and just direct It For Your Glory for your kingdom may it help somebody here Lord and may it direct our course in life may thy visitation give us a purpose this morning oh father that when we walk out of this building oh God that we will know Lord that we are happy and that we are thankful to be thy children to be called by thy Grace of Father Lord I commit myself to thee and commit the order AI to thee everyone that is listening oh Father God may your grace be extended oh God and may we say it was good to be in the house of the Lord and our hearts burned within us as he spoke to us along this way we pray oh God thy blessings in Jesus Christ name amen amen you may take your seats this morning Al Matthew 24:28 Matthew 24:28 for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together amen so we understand that when we come together like this this morning there's a purpose and a reason for it we didn't just come to church to see one another we didn't just come to church to talk about other things but our main goal and purpose on a Sunday morning to gather would be to hear from Heaven would be to hear from our Lord Jesus Christ and would be to be directed in life to have our questions answered to have our sick bodies healed to have a visitation from the Lord and that he can direct us and guide us and that we can find inspiration for life because without God's inspiration your life has got no meaning it's got no Direction he got no purpose but God gives us purpose you know when we were lost in the world we lived a certain kind of a life and um God came our way and he gave our life purpose and Direction a meaning a certain attribute that you you walked from there and you knew that you know what I I I know where I'm going I know where I come from I also know where I'm going and God has given us Grace job chap 10:12 job chap 10:12 amen thou has granted me Life in favor amen and thy visitation has preserved my spirit so you know without God's visitation there is no preservation of your spirit because as We Gather here from different walks of life we need a visitation from God to preserve our Spirits because if you just gather and there's no visitation from God there is no preservation of spirit then you become feeble you become nothing you cannot carry on this race because you need Supernatural vitamins to walk in the race of the end time to walk every day of your life and to say Lord God this is a difficult calling this is a deep calling this is a a calling that I don't have the strength for but if your visitation can come regularly I know that you will encourage me and give me the capability to walk this life that you have called me for because I cannot walk this life alone I don't have the power the ability to stand there and to know that I can make it because in your own strength you can never do it never ever I don't care how long you follow the lord I don't care how deep you into Revelation in your own strength you can never never never walk this walk that the Lord has called us to walk so we know that that visitation is there to revive us to Quicken us to give us inspiration and to activate me into my position because you are not just a church member Hallelujah and let me just from the beginning tell you that the church cannot save you amen a building can never save you a pastor can never save you a prophet can never save you there's only one Savior and that's the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ he is the one and the only one without him there's no Saving Grace so we understand that the church plays such an important role in our lives because you are the Church of the Living God not the building but you as you sit here this morning as an individual you are the Church of the Living God and then we start to understand that the building is just the place to keep us out of the rain a place dedicated for worshiping God a place where you bring and you come together and you you you know they create an atmosphere and do certain things so we come to church to be to to understand where we come from and where we going we come here to hear from Heaven that God can anoint a gift and and speak to me words of life and encourage me along this way and that's the reason for us coming together not to be not to be you know broken down but to be buil up in the Statue of a perfect man now the prophet says in the message to unite un Unity of God of one God in one church he says God does not force man to do anything God has never forced any of you to do anything yeah amen God is not in the business of forcing you yeah God calls you and he says follow me and I lead you to the Still Waters follow me I'll lead you to the pastures where you can feed follow me and I'll carry the burden with you but you are the individual that makes the decision God if you say no God will never Force you because God wants you to make up your own decision to say I'm going to accept Jesus Christ as my savior and then things changes so we would call it the power of decision you have power until you make the decision as a young person you've got power until you make the decision remember when the enemy comes and he tempts you to to go down the wrong road and to start to smoke or drink or to do evil things you have the power until you say yes I'm going to do it the moment you say yes an evil spirit takes a hold of you and you lose all power then you become an addicted alcoholic or a smoker or somebody that does things which should never be done because then you want to get delivered and now all of a sudden you realize I've got no more power now I decide I'm going to stop it that's right and the devil says no there's no stopping here that's right I am now in charge yeah that's you had power until you said yes that's right now you've handed power to me and now you said oh you know I I don't want to do this thing anymore and guess what tomorrow you're doing it again and the next day you're doing it again because you have handed power over and it's the same with Jesus Christ when you hand power to him to say Lord I accept you yes he takes all power from you and now you are a prison of love divine and it's no more your choosing and I thank God for that that once he chose me I can never go lost never he's remove power from me I can decide tomorrow you know I'm finished with God God says no it's no more your decision you handed power to me the day you were born again that's why we love God so much so if the enemy has trapped you and you're in the wrong position the wrong way there is only one way out to repent and accept Jesus Christ that he can break the power of the enemy that he can set you free and that you hand power to him to say Lord I'll rather have you as my master than the devil because the devil's purpose is to destroy you God's purpose is to build you up in the Statue of a perfect man so you have to treat that power of decision with with with care yeah with respect don't make a decision Hasty think about it pray about it and say Lord what should I do here how is the situation because Jeremiah said for I know the thoughts that I think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end so God is always in control and God's purpose is always to bring you to an expected end remember nothing is a surprise to God that's right you might go on your road back home and something happens the car can break down or something can happen tomorrow you come to work your boss fires you God's not shocked because he before the foundation of the world you're going to get fired tomorrow or promoted that's right anything is possible so God is never shocked God is in control of your life and because God is in control of your life it should relieve a certain pressure from us to say Lord I trust you explicitly that the footsteps of the righteous are for ordained and therefore Lord I'm not going to worry about tomorrow but I know that you are already in tomorrow amen because remember you have a purpose and the word gives us purpose the word helps us the word gives us Grace thank you my brother God bless you so without purpose there is emotion without motion there is activity without accomplishments so we can come together we can sing songs which is an activity we can do many things and and and preach sermons and do things but without God and the inspiration of God and without God's presence here it's it's worthless we are wasting time we are wasting one another's time but when God is present then there's a purpose there there is a reason there is a direction because he now takes a full control of us and we need to understand that God wants us to be focused amen amen to be focused that we can look at it and say Lord let me look upon you and live because if you're not focused you know what the devil will just pull you everywhere he will do things with your mind as we come to that you don't want to do we need to be one mind and one purpose now the prophet say we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity amen there's a purpose for that as a church we need to be in unity to love one another respect one another pray for one another serve one another in love because each one of us is holding a part of God that's the key amen that's right so when I look at you what do I see some of you are black some of you are white some of you are brown some of you are different colors but what do we see when we look at one another you know we are diverse some are tall some are short some are beautiful some are not so beautiful like me nothing to look at but you look at one another you say my goodness you know what where are we standing so the key and the secret has always been as the prophet teaches us that we should look at one another and look beyond the flesh because the flesh is just the badger skins the Tabernacle with Moses built you know God placed the most beautiful instruments in there behind Badger skins when you look from the outside you will say I wonder what's in this building because the badger skin is nothing to desire why didn't God put it like like curtains of gold because God says no I hide in Badger skins Badger skins you look at you say man there's nothing to that thing it's ugly it's no thing to desire but what's behind the badger skin your flesh is only the badg of skins I have to have the ability to look Beyond you look behind your color look beond your statue and look and say inside there is a flame of God inside there is the germ of God I love what I see so we should look at one another not at the outward but look inside and say my you know what we might disagree about this a little bit here little bit here we might not see everything eye to eye but I look beyond your flesh and I see God and because I see God I love you I appreciate you that's why God put PE different people in One Church yes different people because it brings diversity it it it learns us to appreciate one another Hallelujah you know when we grew up as as where we come from we are very stiff you know you're born stiff if you say Amen you do like this and then you grow up you meet other people which are born loose they've got gifts you know they just just when they come in front there's a swing they start to we'll stand like this and sing you know but they are different and we start to appreciate and adapt and and and say you know what Lord we are so wonderfully made that when I look at that I appreciate Lord Jesus that you place us together to worship you in spirit and in truth and that relieves pressure because we are not we are not in competition with one another amen remember it's not a competition now listen to this we are each holding a part of God and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it yeah so when we as a the church come together you bring a part I bring a part every one of us bring a small part he says then the pillar of fire is present here this morning that's right Hallelujah you coming to church brings the pillar of fire not from another place but from your heart sitting here and combined together in worship we become then again the people that can say you know what we know that the pillar of fire is here not by a picture but by looking at your brother or sister's face next to you you know that God is here because they carry God and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it when the church sits together in Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts spiritual offices coming together brings the pillar of fire back again so the key is every Sunday or every meeting we have the PO ofier is there because you are there yeah that's right you are you are you are actually walking in with it in your heart yes sir and when we come together each one with their part coming together we uniting and that completes that Pillar of Fire again back into the fullness that we want amen so we bring our light together and each one bring it brings a concentration of the presence of the Holy Spirit that's why we are sitting in Heavenly places this morning we have left the New Zealand half an hour ago ready and we in heaven Hallelujah yes some of you are in the mall some of you are somewhere else but most of us are in heaven that's why when the enemy wants to attack you and pull your attention away and and put you into shopping mall and where you know you can be here and shopping that's right that price is $9.99 but that one is $8.99 I'm going to go there and the pastor is preaching and you shopping online shopping maybe on the phone even in church you don't have to use it but you can use it here so that's why you going understand I'm here to worship I'm here to bring a presence of God I'm here to help my brother and sister I'm here to bring the presence of God and that's why I I'm not going to be distracted I need to concentrate ecclesiastics 4: 9-12 I need to concentrate why because without you I'm not complete without you there is no Rapture without you we are Stu here can you imagine I believe I'm part of the bride of Christ so I've got the conviction and Revelation that without me you're going nowhere sir I'm not from New Zealand I'm from Africa but without me you're going nowhere that's right so you should look at my interest that's right if you really want to Rapture to happen start to look at somebody else's interest to say who can I help who can I encourage who can I who can I be of service to but you all look at ourselves say Lord I'm ready let's go when me and sister Ila got saved 32 years back I said Lord I just made it about two weeks the Rapture will be gone because I could read it in the prophet's message I can read it in the Bible every sermon was the Rapture is here and I just we said to one another you know what I God just waited for us can you imagine yeah and we were so happy and thankful to Lord thank you that you didn't do the Rapture and 32 years later we still here and God is still adding so what does it mean it means that we should look at one another and say Lord let me become a servant to know that I without you lord Jes without that person Lord I can go nowhere but I need Lord to become a servant ecclesiastics 4:9 says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor you can never be a church on your own amen that's amen sir you can never be a single bride the bride is not a single member it's a many membered bride Hallelujah many members and we forget that regularly because we look at ourselves you know and and we start to identify ourselves more sometimes Superior sometimes this way or that way but we are a many member verse 10 for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that he's alone when he follow for he have no other one to help him up this race this Walk of Life you will fall you will stumble there is no one of you perfect no one just has not made one mistake this week we all make mistakes daily but when you stumble and when you struggle then there is somebody around you that can help to lift you up and carry with you and say Lord help this my brother help my sister amen huj verse 11 again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone just imagine it was me and brother and Po in the church this morning what a disaster I'll say something he say amen he say something I shout amen but without without that physical body next to you it becomes lonely it's not about numbers you can be five you can be 10 you can be 12 whatever God has allowed but let there be somebody next to you that you can feel the warmth of the spirit and to draw from that spirit because sometime you come in from the weak and you have been frozen up Satan has attempted you has attacked you he has tried you and now you need some warmth you know when I feel sad and lonely and my wife Embraces me I pull from her energy and strength and I feel better already and it's the same as Bel Bel when you come to church you can draw Warth you can draw energy you can get unfrozen and all of a sudden you start to feel my I want to worship God I want to thank him I want to praise him but if you're alone you go in and you go out that's why if you feel cold just move a little closer to the one next to you and pull amen say Lord let the warmth of my brother my sister let it let it engulf me let it let it warm me amen and if one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and the three-fold court is not quickly broken amen so the battle is the enemy that's why when Jesus sent out his disciples why did he send them two by two why do you think because you think Satan left them alone oh imagine the first town they come in and the people says out out your hypocrit you devil worshippers you follow Jes Jesus the chief of B out and how to you know let's say it was your turn to preach and they shout you out of the church man you walk like this say Lord why do they reject me but then your brother is there don't worry brother Peter don't worry John I am with you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you it picks you up to say let's go to the next town and then I'll take the turn you know maybe God can help us and we support one another that's why God knows we need one another to encourage to love to embrace to say Lord I cannot do it on my own I'm not willing it's a lonely walk but with my with my people around me with your people around me Lord it gives me courage to just move a little bit further for where two or three are gathered together in my name there I'm in the midst of them and the psalmist says the Proverbs says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the right rightous run into it and they are safe so there's a principle that we run into the name of the Lord like a tower and it's a hiding place remember God hides you in his word god hides you in front of the enemy that's why David says he will set the table in front of my enemy and I want you to understand one thing this don't think that the devil does not walk through the door this morning he already started with the with the with the equipment yes when I see that I know man God is going to be good today I thank God already for problems in the sound I say Lord we know if he you know if if the devil starts to move around and trying to disrupt there must be something that you're going to do today and he's trying to get our mind off the matter so he comes and he comes in and we understand that the Tower of the Lord the name of the Lord is a tower and he will said I will set your table yeah not in secret yeah but in front of your enemy actually God wants Satan to be present that's right every time he deals with these people that's right he wants him there that's right so sometimes we think you know what we it's a church is a place where Satan is not allowed no he's invited every meeting it's true right invited to come and look to come and try and disrupt to come and try and get you to do something else that's how God conquers him God's not scared of the devil God is not here to say you know what let's keep him away from you God says you will overcome the enemy in Satan's Eden sir so how can God restrict him God doesn't restrict him in that way he said to him have you considered my bride in 2024 she will never leave my word she will never go away from it she will be true so how can God make those statements If he if he hinders him that's why when the sound comes like that you must already get excited and my this morning is going to be good Hallelujah and it happens like that in every Church the sound can be perfect before the service but wait till it starts man oh man then everything fails then you must already get excited start to thank God so we know why do we come to church to prophesy the seat is not air with the Chuck he says may there not be any feeble Among Us after the service tonight and above all things may there not be one unbeliever left may they all believe to eternal life for that's our purpose of gathering here that's may we all believe unto eternal life that's our purpose of gathering to increase Faith to get a better picture of God to get a picture of me and to walk out of here a conqueror like the man that had a sick child that is for many many years at that foreign sickness and after the Mount of transfiguration Jesus come down from the mountain and here he founds the scribes and the people the the the the the disciples this man with his child in a big commotion that's and he comes he says what's the problem the man comes to me he says I've asked your disciples to heal my son but they cannot do it he says oh your faithless generation how long will I suffer you and he talks with them and he ask how long has the child be like that he says from his birth he's like this and he's like that you know and the Lord said to him if you can believe all things are possible and the man immediately caught the Revelation he says Lord I believe but help my unbelief what is that it's it's a paradox that you know what there's a faith but there's also a battle that wants to hinder our faith and that is my prayer every day Lord I'm a Believer but help my unbelief remove it from me oh God which is the flesh amen your flesh can never be a believer you have to understand the concept you can be in the message baptized with the Holy Spirit for 100 years the flesh does not change you cannot make him a Believer you cannot that's why some people say okay I'm going to teach the flesh a lesson I used to work with somebody and this person you know it was just shortly after I got saved and then you start to talk about the Lord and then you start to discover there's other believers around and so on people with different opinions different visions and different things and I could see that my one colleague he was very uncomfortable he walked very strange when he walks and I said what's wrong says no I'm busy putting the Flesh in subjection so wow how do you do that he says no I've got a a band that I put around my waist a rough cloth every time I W I move it P it it it it scratches me and it makes the flesh to pain and that's the way I'm going to teach the flesh to be subject and I thought my how can it be that that that that man will go to such depths to try and place the Flesh in subjection where the word says you can never you can never make him a Believer the only thing that can place the flesh subject is the holy spirit if you get the Holy Spirit then the flesh becomes subject to the Holy Spirit and then you can control it because the flesh is a powerful entity powerful you cannot control it how many New Year's resolutions did you do every year I'm going to stop this I'm going to start doing this and it lasts maybe one two three if you're good four weeks four weeks then then you finish to you know I'm going to lose weight this year flesh is oh that's good to you and every time you walk past the McDonald's you smell those chips and you you know and you're looking for an excuse you know my blood sugar is low I need some something now and before you know it that resolution is out of the window that's how powerful it is you know even with the Holy Ghost and that's why it's so important to understand with spiritual matters you only go to the word and to what has been revealed and what you hear you don't dictate to the flesh because the flesh can never understand God it can never worship God you worship from the inner man then you tell your flesh you're going to raise your hands this morning and you're going to clap it and you tell your voice I'm going to say amen and you take control of the Flesh and then it becomes a vessel worthy to praise God in the way that he wants us to do and God healed that man's sick child but he says Lord I believe but help my unbelief a paradx statement that we can understand Philippians 2:3 the word says do nothing from selfish or empty conceit but with humility being neither arrogant nor self-righteous regarding others as more important than yourself it's a it's it's a key to look at everybody around you and and and and and say to yourself this person is more important than me even the lowest in the church is more important than me that's how he describes how we should look at one another and how we should you know uh interact with one another to know that you know what I I I I am the lowest I'm the servant of all because Paul says don't look out for your own interest but look out for the interest of others as well now the mind of God is different than your mind yeah that's right and that's where most of our troubles come from we examine life from this perspective here not from here you should learn to look from here yeah like I said if you look from here you see flesh if you look from here I see God if I look from here I see different things I see your shortcomings I see your failings but if I look from here I see the grace of God so we must always learn to if if if you look at somebody from here and you you feel you feel antagonistic you feel I can't just change your looking say Lord let me look like you look look through the blood look through the grace look through God's perspective and you will see a different picture you'll see a completely different picture that's the way God wants us to look at this now if you think about it um the Bible in Acts 12 speaks about uh James and Peter is that right the Bible says that Herod came and he killed James with the SW sword all right he killed him with the sword that's how he starts he killed him with the sword like like it's easy Bible says he just started to Vex the church and he called James in and he took the sword and he killed him and the crowd roared they were excited and he says oh this is good they love what I'm doing he says bring Peter lock him up because it's Passover we'll deal with him next week we can't kill a believer in church like many times we rage battles we'll fight until we come to church and church we worship together oh thank you Jesus God bless you brother God bless you Sister Monday the whatsapp's or what is Flowing battle is Raging but we shouldn't do that we should walk from here free at Liberty to say Lord I am free and I'm free indeed so he takes James he kills him he locks up Peter and he says I'll deal with him when Passover is finished and Peter is locked up in prison he's there in the inner prison around 16 gods and you know how it goes and the the Bible says he is sleeping all right he is sleeping acts 12:6 and when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison now notice how how can you sleep when you're locked up like that knowing tomorrow I'm dead but he's sleeping why because there's a church that's praying for him there's a church that's in the gap for him that's how we should our life should be when you're in trouble you should be so at peace because you know the church is praying for me there is people that's lifting up my hands I'm not alone in this battle there is people that really intercedes for me and he's sleeping and in verse 7 and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him the light shined in the prison and he smoked Peter on the side raised him up saying arise up quickly and he CH and the chain fell up from his hands the angel said unto him G thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he said unto him cast thy garments about there and follow me now you can imagine that the angel had to kick Peter in the side such a deep sleep kicking him wake up Peter and when Peter woke up the change W he jumped up and he was ready to run for the door then youel say stop sandals clothes take make it easy Peter you're running and you're getting excited is not going to help anybody when I'm here I'm in control when God is in your life he is in control don't get over excited don't run this way that way say Lord I'm following you carefully every day Lord I'm following in the footsteps of the Lamb amen and Peter was excited and the angel says whoa no no no your sandals put it on how long does it take on to put sandals and clothes and jacket he says you leave nothing behind Hallelujah the angel didn't run out of prison he walked because that's the key when God is in your life he is in control no worry no no no Panic no nothing is going to change the situation trust the Lord to say Lord Jesus I'm not going to panic I'm trusting you and the Bible says as they walked out every door opened and closed behind them as the angel come that that iron door just Swang open and Peter only to follow the angel he had nothing to do but to follow nothing and he followed him and when outside the angel disappeared now the question is always in our minds that when we come up to this point is why did God kill James and save Peter both Apostles both the elite both of the three were always together when there was a resurrection faith hope and love was called in yeah that's right and when we look at these things we start to compare we can ask but Lord why was Peter more special than James but it's not like that God says James I'm going to make you a Marty that's the end of it God allowed for his life to end in that way and God don't write a long story about it God just says Herod took the sword and he killed him because God doesn't think like us but Peter he saves him because he still has got a work for Peter to do yeah nothing can take your life before God is finished with you I don't care what it is God is in control nothing can disrupt God's plan but we human reasoning would ask certain things how do you know God loves you not because you've got a good job not because you were born in New Zealand my thank God I wasn't born in Africa you know we think like that thank the Lord for this and this no you only know God loves you one one way and one way only that's why by election amen he might never give you money that's right he loves me amen am he might never heal your body he still loves me amen that's he might never answer one prayer he still loves me amen because he called me open my eyes I saw my name written in the Lamb's Book of Life and therefore I know he loves me it's not based on what he gives me or what he doesn't give me it's based on elective love that's why a Son of God can pray Lord not my will but let thy will be done because I know father God you've got the best interest for me at heart I don't want anything that you don't want to give me because sometimes God says no amen too many times we hear you know God will give you every no he won't yeah even if it's in his word he won't if it's his will he will he can heal your sick body right now but we need to learn to trust him amen we need to believe like I'm a believer of Divine Healing 100% but sometimes I walk for years with something that I'm battling with the prophet he made a mistake and he suffered for two years in his body you know things happen God allows things there's there's certain things happen we must learn to know that God is in control check your life and make sure all your sin is under the blood and you walk forward every day and say Lord the footsteps of the righteous are for ordained I trust you explicitly that's the thing we need to do because God's love is only proven by election so we as I said in the beginning remember we are not in a spiritual competition amen is that true you are not in a spiritual competition that's right do you see how many who read the most message books this week who fasted who fasted for three days this week nobody two days one day thank you sister one day 1 hour yes you know so what are we doing we're not in a competition you do is God leads you and it's between you and God and we are at Liberty we are free to worship God the the way that he made us to be an expression but we are not interested to see who's the most spiritual who is the most knowledgeable who is the best because we are all saved by grace we are all under the same Grace and that's a very key and important point to understand that by grace and by grace alone so what should we do we should rather support one another support gifts that God placed in the church to be able to get strength from one another if God starts to use somebody in the church rally behind that gift and lift it up don't say Lord it should have been me I think I I deserve no you know God is God he's in control everything is under his mighty name amen Luke chapter 22: 40 Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane now remember the prophet says the victory was not one in Calvary the victory was one in Gethsemane when Jesus Took the decision he's going to die for the church the victory was done from there he is a lamb to the slaughter he never spoke he never just followed them as they led him as they beat him and everything but the decision was done in Gethsemane but listen to this and when he was at that place he said unto them pray that you enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone cast and kneel down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him that's right now the word in flesh that's right needed a visitation to strengthen him at his greatest test greatest trial there comes a point in time where you need a visitation from God that's why when you come to church and you under great test and trials you say Lord today is my visitation speak to me Lord and give me the energy to continue another week like Jesus he was absolutely depleted and an angel was dispatched to strengthen him for the journey ahead like an Elijah who could kill 400 prophets but the next day run and clam under the juniper tree to say Lord let me die let me die Lord how can you move from poar of fire 400 Kil killed Prophet to under a juniper tree in one day you remember your life is ups and it's it's it's the the mountains and The Valleys we are moving it's a journey you're not stagnant you cannot be on the mountain 24 hours a day then you are in trouble but after every Mountain experience you start to go down into the valley and you start to doubt your own testimony because the devil tells you man you have never been saved you are a liar you are a cheat and you go down there and you start to feel the loneliness but guess what very soon as the visitations of God start to come he energizes you again and you come up on the next Mountain you say Lord I am the redeemed I am a son of the Living God and so life Carries On You are never never 100% On Top of the World constantly you need to learn to trust and that's why God allows it he exposes us to many things that we learn that character is formed that we are that we are molded in the stature of a perfect man because the Bible says Jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered how are you going to learn obedience by the things you suffered people will neglect you people will leave you people will talk about you all those things God will allow it but we look at it and we cry Lord nobody loves me when God allows something you should have a different attitude you should say Lord thank you for working on my character thank you that I love that brother or sister so much I love my boss so much who's hating me I love him Lord because he's in your hand he's a tool that works on me you love me so much that you changed the boss that loves me and give me one that hates me that's how much you love me Lord we don't play like that because we don't see it like that we come to church oh pray for my boss he's going to kill me you should say pray that God will bless my boss because he's the right one he's mouring my character he's pulling things out of me which I know that wasn't there all of a sudden I want to strangle him wonder where does that come from oh my I'm a Believer but now I've got thoughts of I take I'll take mat in my own hands that's God's grace to show you that you need to work on that character to say Lord just make me more like you let me die more and that's the way we as Believers that's why God allows it that's why it works in our lives so angels will come Elijah God sends an angel to make him food wake him up eat he sleeps again he wakes him up again he says eat the journey is hot this food is going to sustain you the word so remember Jesus Christ at at appointments he had his whole life from the day he was born till the day he died was filled with appointments at certain times certain dates he meet certain people it was prescheduled no no accidental meetings no accidental appointments it was all pre-planned and prescheduled like the woman at the well he met her he had an appointment with her so that morning he woke up and he knew this is the day for her and all of a sudden he says to the disciples go and buy food like I always say brother PA you will know when I tell the brothers we work at church I say go and buy us food they want to go five or six together cuz they talk a lot and they say stay away for 3 hours so I've learned I said no only one you choose which one but one only because he'll come back quickly but how many brothers do you need to carry food for 12 people not a lot but he sends all of them as you all go buy food and he sits there on the wall he waits for her because this is a private meeting with a woman that is so deep in sin and shame that he knew if the things I'm going to say to her is going to embarrass her and God's not in the business of embarrassing us God's not in the business of exposing your sin to embarrass you God's in the business to convict you of your sin that you can repent but God will always treat you and protect you because he's not there to shame you he's not there to humiliate you he's there to bring you to the Cross to say you are mine and I bought you with the PR that's why since the day I met Jesus Christ I have never been humiliated I have never felt that he hates me I have never felt that he I I serve him because I'm going to go to hell I have never felt that because he called me and he says you follow me I'll bless you I'll help you you'll be and I love to follow him freely you know what I love that that's right nobody forces you nobody puts a guns against your head to say you know I'm going to kill you if you don't follow Jesus you made that decision yourself that's right and you've never went back on that decision because he doesn't force you to do anything he calls you and he says follow me my sheep he my voice stranger they won't follow and so that's why the message is not a lot of rules and regulations dos and don'ts it's about the love of God being exposed to you and once you see the love of God you start to realize the mind of God and you lay down your own ideas and you know this this is how God's mind work and I'll gladly follow him because he is the one it is the way to get into the mind of God is to have a prophet reveal the word to us and it gives us a deeper understanding of what does this God want like an Esther all the king's wife has humiliated him he puts away a feros and he says I need a new wife and they gather all the virgins and as they prepare to meet the king everyone gets rejected one after the other one but Esther she goes to the king's chamber the one who looking after them she knows there's somebody here that knows the king he ask him how is the king how does he look no he's tall he's blunt he's this he's that what does he like what is his food taste you know all that every little detail she could get from him and she start to get the mind of the king through that interpreter and and he tells her all these things and she takes it she takes it she applies it she applies it she applies it and the night when she needs to go when she walks into the king's chamber he looks at her he was shocked to see himself in the famin spot he was absolutely blown away because no man can hate himself and that's how when I stand before Jesus Christ I want to stand that he can see the feminine part of himself in me because he will never reject you if you stand there clothed by the word he can never leave you behind he will take you that's but don't come with your own ideas and your own issues and your eoms and think he's going to accept you he can never that's why God sends us a prophet to reveal the word so that we know the mind of God not that we can worship the prophet but that we can get the mind of God to turn back to God to say Lord this is true amen so the woman comes to the well Jesus looks at her he says say get me some water please now this woman wasn't very quiet type she spoke up very well she was very feisty we would call it when he spoke to her she immediately you're not allowed to speak to me you are a Jew you know and he says if you knew who's speaking to you you'll ask me for water he says why are you how are you going to get what you don't even have a bucket so you can see the conversation was going God wants you to be real don't be something that you're not don't try and be something that you're not don't try and be somebody else be what God made you to be to say Lord this is the way you made me and this is the way I'm going to Worship You Preach the way that God made you serve him that God the way made you bless him the way God Made You Right some of us can shout amen glory the other one can say amen glory it's the same thing to God don't measure to other people you express and you express from your heart and don't compare don't say but she told him you don't even have a bucket why are you going to get me water says go get your husband she says I have no husband and he says to her yes you had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband what does he do she says wow when the Messiah come we know he will do these things that's right says it's me speaking to you and she dropped everything run into a city and converted a whole little town by the testimony by come see who I found and that woman you're going to find in heaven she had a predestinated appointment with the Lord Jesus Christ it was a private meeting there there was no Witnesses but herself and Jesus Christ because the things he's going to tell her would make me make people blush around her but when he tells her she repents that's right she stops living in sin and her whole life is completely turned around that's how God does things that's why when the prophet calls up people in the prayer line he says confess your sin before you come here because God will reveal it why did he warn them because God doesn't want to humiliate them God is there but Satan will humiliate you he will gossip about you have you heard sister so and so wow I never knew that have you heard brothers so and so the devil is the gossiper the devil is the one trying to break the influence the devil is the one who causes the problem God never gossips that's right God never tells stories he's not in that business but the devil is the one who does these things so you must be careful when one starts to ask what's your motive and objective why do I need to tell the story what is the or can I rather go and pray or talk to the person or can I encourage them what can I do differently than to gossip or do things that's not supposed to happen that's Job 1 verse 6 Job chapter 1: 6 now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them so we spoke about it earlier Satan was found among them in verse 7 and the Lord said unto Satan when where comest thou and Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fr the Earth and from walking up and down in it he never said to him what are you doing here Satan out who was presenting themselves The Sons and Daughters of God and Satan among them so when we come to church Satan Among Us I'll read you the quote just now but he comes why does he come he comes you to put you in the mall while you're in church to put you somewhere else because your mind can drift in a second you can fall asleep in two seconds I mean you walk in here you had such a good night's rest you're so fresh when you sit down if you my what happened to me that's Satan's work but we should be vigilant when you know that Satan is also here you look at it differently when your mind start to drift you must know that's the enemy bring it back and say amen glory to God thank you brother for saying that you know be engaged in the meeting when you feel tired engage in the meeting by just saying an amen or raising your hands or clapping or do something but engage because the enemy is here to rob you of a blessing that's right so once you understand that when the sons of God were coming before God Satan was among them and he's just there to accuse he's not there to worship he's not there to do anything but to accuse and who who who engaged him God himself yeah God says well welcome where have you been you know we think God God's not scared of Satan God created him he's got a role to play in your life he's got a role to play he's there to hone you to to rub you he's there he's playing that role and when we come to church he's playing another role so God says Where Have You Been he says up and down the Earth then God says have you seen my little bride there in New Zealand or wherever you are you know and God entices him that's right God pulls him into the conversation God engages him and directs his attention to somebody have you considered my servant job while you were walking up and down the Earth he says yes I've looked at him but you have protected him you have kept a hedge around him a big fence give just open the fence and he'll curse you in your face God says go take him but don't take his life he's in your power remember Satan has got limited power amen the power he has got is what God allows him to have he's not the Creator he cannot create he cannot do anything he is subject to the authority and Rule of the Living God and so it goes on and Satan leaves there and he went from the presence of the Lord and he starts to attack job is that true now in the testimony on the sea the prophet says that's the way it is it's always a mixed crowd believers make Believers and unbelievers always conglomerate together there they are even when the sons of God came up before God in the Book of Job he said Satan was sitting among them so he ties that down what's happening in church he says it's happened in heaven because we are a type so if Satan is there he says presenting him there he also comes here to disrupt to get your mind off the word to to rob you to tell you it's not for you many things he can do and you should realize and you start to discerned to to push him away to say Lord take this fog away from my mind let me focus on you Lord Jesus let me break through and let me understand now remember even in the prophet's message Satan was there yeah the Lord comes to him one day he says there's a trap set for you the Lord doesn't tell him what's the Trap you know if if if if if if the Lord tells me something I want him to tell me the the the the details there's a trap set for you tomorrow when you fly back the plane is going going to fall from the sky and you're going to be dead or something you wanted the specifics but all the Lord says is there's a trap set for you now he's watching doesn't know where doesn't know how he doesn't know when he doesn't know who's going to do it he's got no idea but he's now Vigilant he's now he's now he's now aware that there's a trap and every time you come to church you must know there's a trap set for me somebody's going to sit at my seat man for a Believer that's a big trap cuz I've sat there for 5 Years everybody know it's my seat so traps when you see that you should realize oh devil I've seen you and you bless God bless you brother thank you for keeping my seat warm I'll sit at the back may you have a good time amen you know so we engage but we must be vigilant we must be there we must be we are believers we think it's just just no there is spiritual things happening around us so the prophet comes to the meeting one one day and then uh I think it was 2 or 3 days later he says I'm in the meeting I'm preaching and the next moment a young boy and a young woman in the front start to kiss one another who's that Satan present he doesn't care if the pillar of fire is there or not remember that's that's the key and he he tells them stop and he continue preaching and they don't stop they go on further and as he preached they they he says at some point the young boy almost start to climb on top of the young girl in church in front of Malachi 4 the Vindicated prophet of God Satan doesn't care who you are where you come from it doesn't care if you've got the holy ghost or not he's there to trick you to to to to to to put a trap for you and he says I looked at them and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost comes to me me and says to me they in your hands whatever you do now say it's going to happen now how that's a trap because they've Disturbed the meeting they have done things which should not be happen in church and now in his mind he's got a battle so what should I do next I can kill them because they disregarded God they disrespected me I can do many things he says and then it comes over me and I say to them I forgive you so when I said I forgive you he says the Holy Ghost fell like a blanket on that church and it was just like a haze and people got healed and the the spirit was so pleased with him identifying the Trap and overcoming it that it overruled Satan and that then became nothing am the people then forgot about that they raised up in the presence and they said I am healed and everybody got delived and there was a mighty outpouring and the devil lost face don't give the devil Glory don't give him the point overcome him every time you come and I promise you God will bless you but be vigilant look at the Trap don't let him deceive you but we walk out of your dis you know dishearted I was disappointed today I was this happened or that or that didn't you know many things can happen we must learn to be vigilant to know I am here with the pillar of fire you are here we are bringing the presence of God and anything can happen but we need to overcome that trap because remember there is spirits and they they they come and they do certain things remember when when when aab and uh was it josephat wanted to go for War and the 400 prophets came and they prophesies go you're going to conquer and josephat says isn't there one more they said AB says yes there's one more but he always speaks against me says bring him so when they collect him the collector said to him just Just for information sake 400 prophets already said the battle is going to be won putting him under pressure yeah because if 400 preacher says it this way and you you're going to come and preach something else you're under pressure and he says I can only say what God tells me to say I'm not willing to do anything but what God tells me verse 14 1 Kings chapter 22:14 Micah said as the Lord liveth what the Lord saith unto me that will I speak verse 15 so he came to the king and the King said unto him Micah shall we go against R of Gilead or to battle or shall we forbear it's a question now listen to his answer and he answered to him go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king now was that truth or a lie because we know that was not what God Said and that's where the people that start to examine the message and pull it apart that's where they lose it because sometimes God allows a man to say things to stumble those that need to be stumbled if you believe this message believe it don't look for faults don't look for errors don't go and Google why is the prophet wrong Hallelujah yes sir you will always find the answers there because if you start your search like that you can pack your Bible and go home you are not for the message we want Believers in the church not people who doubt it I want my church full of Believers that come to church regardless of what they read regardless of what anybody they can write a 100 books with facts that's right proving here is a fact that this Prophet lied who's going to argue with me I can point you to the scripture that's why the prophet says never dislocate never misquote never misplace amen because you'll come up the wrong way a type starts somewhere and it stops somewhere that's why our Prophet was such a god-given gift that he would know where to start the type and stop it very few men can do that because if you run the type too long you end up wrong you know that's why you need God's inspiration even as a minister you need God's inspiration to know how to draw from that inspiration from the prophet and bring it forth otherwise you end up wrong but here he tells him go God is going to prosper you you're going to win oh let's give the Lord a hand aab is going to win that's what he said to him yes now listen to his reaction verse 16 and the King said unto him how many times shall I adure Thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord he had enough sense you know if that Prophet doesn't add thus say of the Lord he's playing with me that's why when you have thus say of the Lord you can lay your hand on and say Lord I believe it it is true it is mine it is mine to believe Hallelujah so the king rebuked him he says stop it I caught you out you didn't add th save the Lord then he says I see the counsel of God I see God calling all his men together I see God is asking them how are we going to get Elijah's prophecy fulfilled that aab should die how are we going to do it he says and the Bible says one says this and the other one says this and the other one says this a discussion and a lying Spirit came from Hell presenting him Before the Throne of God they are not scared to present thems there a lying spirit in the throne room that's why a lying Spirit can come behind the poopet and he can lie to you he can excite you if it's not thus sayith the Lord I don't want it it's not for me thank you very much I have thus say of the Lord I happy amen so we can see how dangerous it becomes the Lord doesn't say to the lying Spirit Get Out Satan he comes up and he says I'll go and look at the Lord he ask him how will you go doesn't this say go yeah the Lord is very very specific when he comes to Satan because he knows he's fly he knows he will give him the P this finger and he grabbed the whole hand how will you go he says I will anoint 400 prophets to lie and the Lord says that's a good idea you will be successful go and he comes down he anoints 400 prophets they all tell aab and them go you're going to prosper go you're going to win and here comes Micah the one and when he comes to that point telling them that high priest or the the main Prophet walks up to him hit him in the face where did the spirit of God go and it left me into you and there a big commotion and the King says look up the this man feed him the bread of misery till I come back he says if you come back God never spoke to me I see Israel scattered like sheep without a Shepherd because he knew like a prophet in our day which I met that said if I have this doesn't come to pass put a badge on my back I'm a false prophet and March me through the street that's how certain a prophet of God is because God spoke to him Hallelujah yes sir for a man to make that statement he must have heard Direct directly from God and that's how our Prophet could many times say this is going to happen and it happens exactly that way Hallelujah is that true so it happens they lock him up they go aab is killed and we know the history why he got killed because Elijah made a prophecy but we don't want to go there Zechariah 3 from verse one then the guiding Angel showed me Joshua the high priest in the Amplified I'm going to read from the Amplified as well Zechariah 3:1 then the guiding Angel showed me Joshua the high priest representing disobedient sinful Israel standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at Joshua's right hand to be his adversary and to accuse him so Joshua the high priest standing with his Priestly garments and the devil there to accuse him the Lord said to Satan in verse two the Lord rebuke you Satan even the Lord who now and ever has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you is this not a lock snatch and rescued from the fire now Joshua was clothed with ffy nauseating vile garments and was standing before the angel of the Lord and the Lord spoke to those who stood before him saying remove the filthy garment from him and he said to Joshua see I've caused your wickedness to be taken away from you and I will clothe you and beautify you with Rich Robes of forgiveness so it's a type of Our Lives the visitation of God the word of God is always there to show us the grace of God you are only here by the grace of God you are saved by the grace of God now Joshua stood there with his finest your finest behavior is filthy rags before God that's right your best behavior that's what he's saying here yeah Joshua the high priest standing with his Priestly garments in front of God it looked it stank it was dirty it was ffy that God said to the angel take off the garments now I want you to notice he didn't say to Joshua out of my presence go and fix yourself up and then you come back your your unworthy yeah no he knows when you come to him you need his grace you cannot dress yourself you cannot clean your you cannot save yourself you can do nothing for yourself he said to the angel strip him that's right and dress him with my robes so that's where we are so we compare ourselves with others to make ourselves feel better so that's why we don't compare to one another cuz if if if I can find somebody in church that's a little bit lower than me then I feel more righteous we've got a a man-made righteousness that comes into the message ranks that people look at themselves say I'm not as bad as that one or our church is not as bad as that church you know it's it creeps and easy that's right but you must leave that alone to say Lord God this church is here by God's grace I am here by your grace I have got no righteousness of my own Lord I don't want to hang on to my righteousness Lord leave it oh God I need your grace I'm just thankful to have a church to Fellowship I'm thankful for my brothers and sisters Lord I'm not going to compare to them because if a person that compares he's got problems in his life a secret sinner loves to compare because he looks at it and say Lord at least like a Pharisee I'm not as that one I've got problems Lord but at least that brother you know he steals money and he smokes I only steal money so Lord at least [Laughter] but we compare yeah you know I pray 5 hours he prays one minute we compare to make us feel righteous you must realize this morning that you have got no righteousness of yourself every righteous every righteous fiber you've got comes from God he has made me righteous I have tried many years I've given up and he is doing the work and I thank him for that amen so our most righteous Deeds is still FY rags in his sight because we want to be good enough in God's eyes you know when I come that day in front of God I need to be good enough you will never be good enough for God am if he doesn't see the blood you're in trouble you will never never be good enough for God that's right you must look to what he has done for you to say I'm good enough for God by the grace and the blood that protects me he doesn't even see me he only hears my voice you can never be you know it's like what we do when you make a mistake you want to correct it with something good let's say I stole money this week the till was open I walked into Hallmark there and the till was open I took $1,000 and I walked out and the Holy Ghost convicts me and I said okay I'm going to give 2,000 to the poor so I'm okay that's how we work as humans we try and balance our wrong Deeds with good deeds so if I Wrong somebody I'll be kind to somebody else and I feel okay I've I've balanced the scales I've wronged one person I'll be good to two I've stolen a th000 I give 2,000 back you feel the scales has been balanced I've wronged my wife now I bring a little Bush of flowers you know I slammed the door I went to work I come back tonight I feel sorry I bring flowers I say honey here has flowers for you I love you that doesn't balance the scales only thing that balance the scales is on your knees to say Lord forgive me no money you're going to pay back no nothing is going to balance the scales the only thing that balance the scales is say Lord I Repent wash me with your blood let your righteousness be mind I'm sorry Lord No Good Deed can ever cancel a bad deed so we have to have the right mindset to know that when the Lord visit us with his word he puts us in the right frame of mind for an opportunity to say Lord forgive me I have wronged Lord forgive me Father wash me with your blood because Lord I am dependent upon your grace and dependent on what you do now remember Joshua never argued with the Lord says but Lord I've I've been high preach for for so many years Lord I've tried my best Lord he just kept quiet because in the presence of God you know I'm in trouble I can just stand there and depend upon his grace and his grace was extended to Joshua not by Joshua himself but by an Angel standing there and that's why I thank God for the grace that is extended To Us by an Angel from Revelations 107 and I saw another Mighty Angel clothed with a cloud coming down God coming down and he is dressing us with his word that's right that's the grace of the Lord if it wasn't for that we would be in deep trouble that's right we have to understand that now the prophet says in the Easter seal he says I don't have any righteousness that's right that's your Prophet Malachi 4 that's right spoken word dead back to life all those things he says I don't have any righteousness not in my own I don't have any mine is fthy dirty rags that's right amen I hate to try to go to heaven on my preaching yeah amen you are not going to heaven because you come to church amen I'm not going to heaven because I stand behind the pulpit I'm not going to heaven that's not what he says I'm not going to heaven because I'm preaching he says and I'll hate to try to go to heaven on my preaching that's right because if I said one word wrong it is wrong I'd hate to try to go to heaven to on my Visions I'm going to heaven because I hold to his grace in my heart you only going to heaven because he has given given you grace and grace in abundance his grace that's why I'm going that's how we go by his grace and by his grace alone and that's what we want to believe now let's go back to Joshua the high priest uh Zechariah 3 verse 7 and we close with this Zechariah 3 ver7 now he's dressed Joshua he's taken off the FY garments he's given improper garments he's own right is gone he knows I'm I'm I'm a sinner to begin with and now he comes at the end he says thus sayth the Lord of host if you will walk in my ways that is remain faithful and perform my service then you will also govern my house and have a charge of my court and I will give you free access to my presence among these who are standing here that's the Amplified version which just gives us the context to say if you follow this word I'll give you free access to what to my presence to my throne room just like the devil can walk in any time you can also walk in anytime if he can do it how much more a son and daughter of God representing the blood come you think God is going to refuse you you think God is going to kick you out he can never refuse you when you come like this and he has dressed you in his righteousness when you come there he'll say come my child what can I do for you even the half of my kingdom that's right like an Esther after she became Queen the king is busy he doesn't see a evil man come on the scene he accuses her people of being evil and the decrees made that they must all die on a certain date and the word comes back to her to say you better now intercede for us she says I can't go because if I go unold I'm dead and they say if you don't go you're going to die anyway she says okay 3 days fasting I'm going to go and as she enter that throne room and the the doors open and the King sees her and her name is announced people were frozen because they know there's a law that says if you're not called and you enter that room you are dead but when the king sees her he sees himself no man wants to kill himself he sees the love of his life and he points the gold and he says oh Esther what can I do for you even the half of my kingdom but she was not interested in the half of his kingdom I'm not interested in half of God's kingdom if I've got God if I've got Jesus I've got everything Hallelujah she knew she said no oh great king if it pleases you if I found favor just come and dine with me tonight just come and talk to me she had wisdom a type of the Bride just come Lord I Want To Worship you I want to talk to you and that's how the thing unfolds and it's the same with the bride so you have got an access to God's Throne an access to his table that he has opened up for you by his grace that can never be taken from you now what does the devil do he keeps you hostage with your past as soon as you start to to to feel the freedom and the liberty of worship and want to do something for the Lord he puts a gun against your head and says remember what you've done how do you how do you think you can do now these things who gave you the right you know you cannot do that remember all the evil things you've done when you in the world remember all he he keeps you hostage and he keeps you back he hinders you and he's trying to destroy your your relationship and worship and fellowship with God in such a way that he will do anything to remind you even what you've done this last week anything he will to hinder you he keeps you a hostage but I want to tell you this morning that you are no longer a hostage the devil has got no right to remind you of your past because God says when you repent it is Forgiven it is in the sea of God's forgetfulness and God himself don't remember it that's how I want to look at my life to say Lord I've repented I don't know the Satan can never forget it but I'm not going to let him dictate to me I cannot worship you I cannot do things for you because of my past my past is in the past the past can never help you the past you can never relive that life you can never go back and fix it I mean how many of us would love to go back and change certain things certain decisions you've made certain things you you know man I was so foolish I wish I can reverse time and I'll do it different but there's nothing like that what's done is done but I thank the Lord Jesus Christ I thank the Lord for his capability that when I say Lord I am sorry I have asked forgiveness it is wiped out of the mind of God that even if Satan stands there next to me and accuses me day after day the Lord turned to him that's the first time the Lord turned to him when he accused Joshua the first time the Lord said to Satan I rebuke you that's when Satan accused the bride the Lord says I rebuke you Satan she's virtuous she's sinless she is the white wife my wife she is dressed by the word she has got nothing that hinders her Hallelujah so even God himself now start to speak for the bride Amen to say to say didn't stop it I had enough amen I had enough of your stories I had enough of your lies this woman woman is pure this woman is washed in the blood this woman is dressed by my righteousness she stands in her position she knows where she come from she knows where she's going she's not resting on her own ability you cannot work yourself into heaven Never No Good Deed will put you in heaven no amount of preaching will put you into heaven no amount of coming to church will put you into heaven but accepting Jesus Christ your savior your God your guide the word being manifested and you in tune with that channel to know that I have received and being born again a new creation what You' have done is gone even what your father has done is gone what your grandfather has done is gone it's all cut off by the blood and you stand there virtuous sinless that's why the Lord could tend to Satan say I rebuke you s keep your mouth shut I'm busy dealing with this bride I'm dressing her in my righteousness she has not said once that she's righteous she has not said once she deserve anything she has not claimed anything once she just stood there in absolute silence looking to him for Grace can you imagine just looking me in the eye say Lord I'm here not not even speak speaking and the Lord speaks says Angel messenger take off those filthy garments and then he says put on righteous garments while Satan is he says I rebuke you Satan and Satan kept quiet from there on that's right and the Lord at the end comes and he says now you have an open access to my table Hallelujah whenever you have a need of me just walk in amen when you come Sunday to church just pull into a Heavenly places just reach and Touch the Hem of my garment and I promise you you've got a legal ticket to pull from God anything you need any desire you can present to him to say Lord I need you oh God hallelujah and it's an open ticket that can never never expire that can never never be taken from you not your righteousness you have none not your ability you have none but what he has done for us his grace his love his kindness his goodness his Mercy that we can stand that's why I could never understand how the prophet could say even if he sends me to hell i'll worship Him in hell it's a man that understood that I'm not serving God to go to heaven I'm serving God because I love him I'm not serving him to give me a good job I'm serving him because I love him amen I'm not serving him to to heal my body I know he can do it but I'm serving him because I love him amen that's the first basis and that's always been the basis and it must every believer's basis be I love him and I serve him because I love him and I love him because he first loved me when I was unlovable in the world when I was dirty FY he loved me when nobody saw any good in me he loved me am when there was something you know it's it's so it's so profound that when you come in from the world some of us are born in the message is different you know you grow up in the message and you're born in the message and and and and and God Saves You by grace and you carry on you serve him but if you come from the world it's a different perspective even if you're born in the message you must be born again yes sir that's it's no guarantee that because your father and mother is believer that you will become a Believer it's the grace of God extended to you as an individual amen everyone must have his day at and I remember when me and sister IL got saved the first day we walked into a message church it was profound it was it was so so huge we sat at the back we looked at the people the sisters looked like Angels you thought is it possible we will never fit in here we can never be like this people they they are changed they are different kind of people people you know you come with the marks of the world your your your hair is short you you you you just you come with all those things but guess what a few months later we looked exactly like they look because that same spirit of God started to wash you and clean you and now when you tell somebody where you come from they say are you lying you never that's the power of God that's why when we look at one another all I see is Grace that's why I don't care the color of your skin I don't care where you come from when I see the blood when I see the Holy Ghost I am happy to fellowship with you and to raise my hands with you to say Lord the pillar of fire is here because your people is here and they represent it so it's the grace of God that we can live this life never lift yourself up but become humble never think it's your own ability but trust God because the moment you lift yourself up you're going to fall just trust the Lord be humble be saturated with his love and just look up to him and say Lord let your love be effective in my life I know I've disappointed you so but Lord I found Grace some of us are saved at the young age some of us are older but God's timing is perfect God's timing is absolutely perfect at the right and and for for most of us the timing in our own mind was wrong but God's timing is never wrong when God saved me it was the wrong time for me but the right time for God and I thank him for that trust him believe him and he will be so good to you he will be so so good to you a love relationship not a forceful one not a one that threatens you but a one that pulls you deeper every time he speaks to you he pulls you he he you hear that voice calling your name come up higher come up higher that's what we want that's what we need let's bow our heads if you have a need this morning just to raise your hand to the Lord to say father I raise my hand with a need behind it father you know my desire you know my fear you've spoken to my heart this morning Lord Jesus and I trust that you will help me you have given me answers Lord you've given me direction you have showed me my place in your word and you have clearly identified oh Father God your plans for my life your word and instruction your word of place that can guide me in so wonderful ways that I can look at it Lord and understand it's only by your grace and your grace alone and there's also an opportunity to say Lord my own righteousness I lay down I want your righteousness father your righteousness father mine only is filthy rags like the prophet says I hate to go to heaven on my preaching my Visions I'm only going by the grace of the Lord I'm only going because he has given me Grace and he's instructed me by his beautiful word that's why when the Lord calls your name it's such a marvelous happening it's such a wonderful privilege to be a son and daughter of God to see the fullness of the word and to see how God so masterfully planned our lives that the footsteps of the righteous are for ordained there is no accident no Hazard happening but I believe in God 's predestinated Grace that he predestinated us that he elected us and that he saved us in a wonderful way let's put our needs to the Lord this morning as we bow our heads father as we stand in thy presence this morning Lord we become so small when we see your greatness your absolute love and mercy your beautiful wisdom oh God Lord that we want to say Lord Jesus may you strip us of our own righteousness may you dress us oh god with your own righteousness this morning again and may we know Lord God that it's by grace and by grace alone that we stand before thee as the blood-washed Bride of the Living God lord every hand that's raised before thee every heart that is lifted before thee this morning has got a need Lord I pray that you will be the after speaker that you will be the bomb of Gilead that where Satan has kept your people may be hostage or has lied to somebody oh Father God may you oh God just show us the clarity what you have done for us oh father that your blood is powerful that your mercy is great that your word cannot return unto your Void but will accomplish that what it sent out to do do may you forgive us our wrongs oh father as we fail you oh Father God so many times we pray oh Father God that you will forgive us oh God and keep us under your blood that oh Lord our your mercy will endure forever for us oh Father Lord we love you oh God from the bottom of our hearts oh God we love you that you saved us oh Father we love you that you washed us clean we love you that you give us the Holy Ghost we love you father that you direct our paths we appreciate that you said you will never leave us nor forsake us father we love and appreciate you oh God may you bless us oh Lord may you keep us in this journey and may we be able to discern right from wrong may we not be deceived but may we follow carefully in the bloody Footprints of the Lamb this morning we bless this church oh God as we pray for its Pastor may you continue

love oh God and your grace oh Lord we really appreciate you oh Lord thank you oh God for your kindness oh we serve such a wonderful God Prophet says remember that you don't carry the fullness of God many Believers think they are the complete fullness he says you carry a portion and when we come together it becomes the fullness you yourself are not the only single member of the Bride you need a many membered bride and when every member takes up his position it becomes complete it becomes perfect it becomes efficient it becomes effective it becomes a body that is indestructible ible that's why he said when we go out here we will go out an invincible Army every sickness every disease under your feet as Pastor Ben comes forward please brother you just trust the Lord depend upon Him He
