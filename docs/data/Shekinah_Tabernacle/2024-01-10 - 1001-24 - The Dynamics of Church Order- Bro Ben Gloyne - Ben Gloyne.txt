you amen migrated South praise the Lord great to have you here amen praise the Lord amen let's go to um Genesis we're going to read 2 Corinthians 3 first and then we're going to go to Genesis 1 and one I'm going to read a couple of scriptures here so second Corinthians 3: 5 and 6 it says here not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who Alo who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen amen was going to go read Genesis 1 just read verses 1 to 4 I'm going to read about I'm going to speak about rather the the the Dynamics of church order tonight wow so this is kind of you see while we're going to Genesis well we you'll see amen says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was with was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight gracious father we're so thankful that we can place Our Hope in you Am Lord our expectation oh God we're so thankful we can come before you tonight and say Lord truly our hope is in you Lord You're our hope and our stay you're our everything and we thank you for this opportunity we can gather tonight Lord to to hear from you to worship you to be in your presence so I just want to ask de God as we've read uh some scriptures from your great Eternal Word may you Lord the great author now step in and take over and and and expound upon these for your glory Lord we thank you we just want to ask you cover us in your blood tonight Lord may you have preeminence we just want to think of uh everyone who's not here tonight may be their portion Lord may you be uh with the Piza family dead God as as Ezekiel was born yesterday father May that little treasure just Lord might be such a blessed time father meeting him and just just watching him grow dear God and we commit them into your hands and anyone else who's away we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight so I want to talk about the Dynamics of church order just for a few moments see many people will uh you know I've heard sermons on Church order and why you know uh you know just basically going over what brother Bram said how church service should be and all those things but I was thinking well but but there's a reason behind it you know you know there's a there's a dynamics of the Holy Ghost in church order you know it's more than just laying out things on this is a law this is how things should be but there's but there's a purpose behind it and and now we we know that church is really like uh well the preaching of the Gospel is just like in Genesis 1 where where we were like the Earth before the Lord found us we were in darkness you know we were without form and void and darkness covered the face of our deep and you know but but there was life in there because if you keep reading down I don't have the scripture uh there but you know keep reading down that when God uh brought forth botony life the seeds were already in the Earth it never said he created them they were already there and just like a True Believer has a gene seed of God on the inside of the inside of them but it takes the light of God the manifestation of the spoken word am mean the word of our day to to to shine upon us and and and as soon as God begins to do that he begins to separate light from darkness that the life that's within us comes forth just like the life that was in the earth God kept brooding over it until finally that life came forth and man was here and amen so so this is what really church is to do to bring seeds to life amen to to cast out Darkness off of people's lives that you know the light of God's word would shine and bring forth amen so so this is the P purpose of church this is the the Dynamics of uh Church order now we know that our sufficiency is of God so we're here to to preach by the spirit of God the spirit giveth life it's not the letter it's not the dead letter of the law it's the spirit behind the word that gives life and that's what we want to Major on I think is the spirit of the word amen not just the not just the What's called the dos and don'ts but but what's the purpose what's the Dynamics behind those things you know because if we can really I believe if we can really grasp the Dynamics of church order why brother bandam laid out certain things the way he did I believe we would embrace it like never before and I believe we would see the power of God and a far greater manifestation amen so so I pray that we can just just enter in tonight amen we can see you know sure we say well we're going to church it's a wed day Wednesday or a Sunday but I pray wouldd really enter into church like never before especially this could be the last year we're here so why not in in end on a bang you know end on a high you know so why not so Hallelujah now brother B would say one of the doctors said well I tell you I find this that the greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb but a believer in contact with his maker it changes the whole attitude changes his mental changes his habit changes his body it changes his nature everything am mean so the greatest power on the earth is a believer in contact with his maker I mean so so that's the purpose of church that's why we gather is that we would come in contact with the Living God now we know it's an individual walk with God you can meet God in your car at home you can meet God anywhere but you know there's something very powerful when the body of Christ comes together or the gifts of the body come together you know we come into Harmony One Accord one heart one mind one Accord that God would come down in a far greater way than he could just by ourselves yeah amen that's right I know this is this is probably nothing new to anyone but hey here we are um you know uh so God would tell Moses uh he says and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them see that was the purpose of the law that was the purpose of of of of all the levitical code and everything that God would dwell among his people that was the purpose of it that was the Dynamics of it and you think about it if you're an Israelite back in those days you think you know you think what's the purpose of all this and all the badger skins and the Tabernacle and all these things it'll come down to one thing Jehovah God wants to dwell Among Us he doesn't want to be just above us or somewhere away he wants to walk among his people he wants to be with us and that's what God wants to be not just with us in US amen because the Bible says he's Christ in you the hope of glory so now this all boils down to the heart okay all of this boils down to the heart of the worshipper it's really you know like even even with the you know Moses and the people building The Sanctuary that would have really been the heart of the Builder would have been the most important thing not their skill not how smart they were but but their sincere genuine Hearts I believe would make all the difference it's like Solomon how how you know Solomon was instructed you know Solomon built the Lord a house and we know that God doesn't dwell in temples made with hands you know as say the prophet he says Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me say the Lord or what is the place of my rest now man can't build a t Temple for God yeah right like this church is just a meeting place it's a place dedicated to God God doesn't literally dwell in this building because we've called it a church no God dwells in you and I he we are the living Tabernacle of the Living God Amen we are Lively Stone so when I'm talking about this house of worship or the Dynamics of church order that should be the holy ghost moving in your life that is the Dynamics of church order now you see when Solomon dedicated the temple it would have all been in vain if the Shak kind of Glory didn't come into the hly of holies it would have been all in vain if the presence of God didn't come down and accept their sacrifice it would have meant nothing all of the building all the trumpets all of the you know this is probably not the best but but you see all the playing all the sacrifices Solomon's Prayer everything would have been in vain if God didn't come that's right so could you imagine remember this is never no one had ever built God a temple like this before this was new ground they had the Tabernacle in the wilderness they had all those things but now Solomon was building them in house how sincere do you think that would have been that day of dedication morning I mean when God you know was going to come down it would have been incredible incredibly sincere time and we should never let and I think as time went on From This Moment the temple became common to the people they got used to that's the that's the temple and there are the sacrifices this is the high priest this is they would got they would have got uh it would have become common to them Church order but we should never let it become common to us that we can gather as a people a blood-washed blood bought redeemed filled with the Holy Ghost people that God can come down and operate through everybody not just the musicians not just the preacher not just the tech team but everybody I me because remember we are all part of spiritual worship we're all here to worship God Amen we're all here to be part of the service amen we're all here to to to create an atmosphere by a surrendered life a Heart full of love that God can come and and dwell Among Us amen so so you know David David would would come to a place in his life when he realized that that all of the all of the sacrifices weren't really what God wanted he wanted more than just the form of worship he wanted the heart of the worshipper and he would write in Psalms 51 oh Lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show shall show forth thy praise this is very this is a very common theme in the Book of Psalms praise and thanksgiving and joy I I'm so thankful those so like those are underlying themes of worship Thanksgiving praise and joy amen for thou desirest not sacrifice else would I give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise so if you come to God with a broken Spirit a contrite heart God won't turn you away you say I'm so broken I can't come to the prince of God I can't worship him like I really should no you can if you're in that condition cuz God will not turn away your sacrifice do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion build thou the walls of Jerusalem then thou shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offerings then um shall they offer Bullocks upon thine altar so David said it's not about the Bullocks it's about the heart of the person now the scripture tells us that we're a chosen generation a royal priesthood amen a holy nation A peculiar people that peculiar doesn't mean a funny people it means a particular treasure to God Amen you're very precious in His sight amen that you might show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light Hallelujah am mean so he hasn't called you into just any light it's His Marvelous Light he called you out of darkness and brought you into His Marvelous Light for the reason that we would show forth Praises we would give show forth Praises of him who has done this for us and this is such a I'm probably going to repeat this a lot that phrase but in different words but in terms of it's a condition of us as we come to church really this is what it's all about because people think Church order I've got to line up with this and this and I've got to do all these mechanical things and the Dynamics of it is a surrendered Heart full of love to God and this is why brother baham taught a lot of the way he did with church uh Church order to get us all in condition that we can really worship God not just sing not just hear sermons not just pray and go home but be in a spiritual atmosphere that all of us can enter into spiritual worship because we know what has happened down Through the Ages like Paul saw it coming the Deeds of the nicians and how that spirit is or the doctrine and you know that white horse rider came through and you know separated separated instead of everyone being holy part of a holy spirit Ministry it was now only the priesthood of the ministry was holy and and this is a far cry to what it should be it should be that we're all in Holy Spirit Worship we're all part of the you're all on the ministry team you're a minister I don't know if you realize it or not but we're all a minister amen we're here to minister unto our God give him praise amen he says and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the ly and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it I pray I pray if we're in this condition Lord get us out of this condition and if we're if we're not in this condition may we never get into it amen where where it's not just maybe some inspir preaching here and there we tried to absorb it but it's actually we're all Anointed with the same Spirit we're all filled with the same Holy Ghost amen this is a far cry from Paul who said that when we all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship amen now I'm going to get to church order dynamics of it I'm getting I'm just laying a bit of a foundation but if I run out of time I'll pick it up later now brother Braham says this in the dedication of um um of the building of the Lord he says so you see the dedication of a church doesn't really uh doesn't only mean coming and saying Lord I give you this building but it means Lord we give ourselves to you and sacrifice it isn't an a lily on the altar that God wants every Easter morning it's the cner on the altar it's not the class and the beauty of the building which is fine Solomon's Temple was the same but it's un but it's coming under the Articles of God coming uh coming s self-sacrifice to the service of God and when Israel had finally made one place that they could all dwell in come to a place and meet God Under The Fellowship of the blood then they begin to sing with joy they begin to play the harp they praised God in such one Accord until it sounded like one voice a singing then Solomon stood up to pray to make the dedication to the Lord and when he did that remember the ark had already been brought in under the wings of the cherubim and set back in the Holy place but when the people dedicated not the church not the building but when the people got with one Accord and prayed with one Accord and sang with one Accord and everything was of one Accord then the holy spirit in the form of the pillar of fire moved into the building and settled upon the place it was so much glory in that building until the priests could know could not Minister anymore amen and if I could say it another way I pray it comes into such a place that it's not man ministering it is God ministering it is God worshiping it's God singing It's God praising it's God singing It's God playing it's God preaching it's God saying Amen in the Pew amen that that the glory of the Lord fills these these temples so much that it's not us having church it's God having church cuz God loves to have church amen so I pray that this is this is what we aspire to to see God take control in a greater measure amen well we don't try and hold ourselves together we let God do what he wants to do that's it amen he says now God let it be again let it come again to this little Tabernacle we walk through the blood or under the blood of the Lord Jesus confessing our sins and be filled with the spirit and come here and you people this morning I say this evening should be just as glad and happy of this little Tabernacle as Israel was of theirs come under the same order so they come and happiness will come to your heart bear in your heart that you'll never condemn any man that's born of the spirit that you'll have fellowship with all of his servants with all of his people may this stand as an inter denominational institution amen amen may this stand to a place as a wering may come by may this be a place this house by the side of the road may it be a place where the pilgrim the wayfaring man can find rest as he enters its door amen amen so we know in the book of Acts that it says that when they with one heart one mind one Accord it's it's when they all with one Accord in the day of Pentecost that's when the Holy Ghost came right and that word one Accord means of one mind one passion one Accord amen so they were with one mind what is that one mind Lord I want to see you live amen what was that passion Lord your word is true you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord I want to see you do the miraculous I want to see you do what we think is impossible cuz all things are possible to you Lord I want to see you change lives I want to see you change my life this is this should be the passion of Our Lives Lord change me to match your word amen amen change me amen that when you see me Lord you see you amen this should be the passion of our lives and this was they were all with one Accord then the Holy Ghost came now it can be a thing well how do you get one Accord it's very simple you begin to Center your thoughts right now on the Lord Jesus see this is why brother Bram said that you know people should come early about 30 half an hour before church starts and and and there's an anointed piano player or or or some Godly music playing is that we can get out of the hustle and bustle of the week or day or morning whatever and we can settle our Spirits Down Under the presence of God and we can begin to get into the atmosphere get into the anointing before the song leader steps forth yeah amen if you can't get here on time that's that's fine this is not a law right I'm just talking about the Dynamics behind it you know this is why brother Braham I believe laid these things out is that we could we could come maybe we've had the worst morning of our lives but we can come to church we can begin to think on him we can get one Accord we can think on his goodness think on what he's done for us think on how how powerful he is and how great he is and what he's saved us from and we can have a testimony meeting in our hearts as where before the church ever starts and then you'll find yourself you're troubled and and and things are going on in your mind but by the time you finished you're praising God before there's ever been a hallelujah amen come through the place amen why because now you've got one Accord you've got into the spirit amen you're thinking on the right thing yes that's why there's such a mind battle in this day because if we can just begin to think on the goodness of God who's ever done that you feel troubled then you think on the Lord and what he's done and you go from sad to glad you may go from you know broken and whatever more but then you're happy there's a sweetness in the whole thing you're going through why because you know how good the Lord is amen that's why it's so important that's why it says we should all be with one Accord in one place that's why the Apostle Paul would say be careful for nothing now we know this is all good I mean this applies to any part of the day not just before service right but be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God we should always remember the with Thanksgiving so you pray for something add some Thanksgiving on the end oh yes praise the Lord and not just a little bit a whole bunch cuz we'll have eternity to give him thanks amen amen and the peace of God which pass passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus and finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you praise the Lord so that's a lot of things to think about things that are true honest just pure lovely good report virtue praise that's a lot of things yeah that doesn't give a lot of gray matter for anything else really when you think about it amen that's why brother Bram says we should we should be in the be in the sanctuary early that we can get into a spiritual atmosphere before the first song is ever sung amen that's why it's so important now that our musicians are are we should all be dedicated to the Lord right we should be it doesn't matter if you never stand here never stand here never sing a special anything you should be just as dedicated as anyone else cuz we all part of this together amen amen because we know that there's power in music there's power in anointed Godly music amen because the whole purpose of playing you to think about it musicians when you get up here your mission is to cast out Devils you're going to cast out Devils you're going to disrupt the kingdom of Hell amen maybe the devil's been working on someone for weeks and months and building complexes and strains and pains and hurts but then you begin to play and all of the devil's work just gets busted to pieces I mean because the anointing of God comes down and sets that person free I mean just like David he took up the harp and played with his hand and so Saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him that's how important it is this is this is not just entertainment no this is we have a song service cuz to cast The Devil out of the place amen amen that's why we worship amen this is the Dynamics of why we have a song service we get into the spirit amen the devil gets cast out because we know that the yoke is D shall be destroyed because of the anointing so anything that's oppressing anything that's troubling anything that's going on in our lives that yoke is destroyed because the anointings the anointing of the Holy Ghost breaks the Yoke amen breaks mind battles blak breaks complexes and troubles and everything that's going on in life those are broken because of the anointing you may not have any trouble in the world but you can create an atmosphere out of a heart of love and Thanksgiving that can break every yoke in this place yeah amen that's right amen you can break yolks on the internet amen amen maybe the recording picks up your praise and Hallelujah and shout and then God anoints that and somewhere on the other side of the world and someone set free that's how powerful it is amen so this is why it's so important now and and we also know that the Lord inhabits the Praises of his people we know we are the spiritual Israel so you begin to praise God out of a thankful heart this is why we have trouble getting to church you know there's a lot of can be a lot of disruption in the morning a lot of things going because the devil doesn't want us to get primed and ready for you know to really have church we can sit through church but to have church is a different thing and we want to have church amen where everyone's anointed everyone's praising God where the word has effect in everyone's life and God does what he wants to do amen but you see that God inhabits the pra see the devil does not want God to inhabit your praise but if you really praise him see it's irrespective of what's got you you can to have the biggest battle of your life right now you praise the Lord the Lord will inhabit that praise amen amen so so you so we go to begin to praise God and then God comes down then what does he do he breaks the Yol of the enemy this is why we're all in this together praise the Lord amen I'm glad we're a team this is not a Onan band We're All in This Together doesn't matter how old you are who you are we're all in this together amen amen then brother Bram says this he says do you understand church that in doing this you have the whole church in the spirit of worship before the word comes into to be taught then the Holy Spirit gets in the word and manifests God through the word to be a confirmation of your worship your worship I take that as individual yeah who wants their worship to be confirmed by signs following now I put this in here because I and I begin to think well people are going to start thinking well I it's my ability that's going to cause this to happen no the first thing we must Master is the thought of human ability this is in the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness a very good message he says the important thing one of the most important things that we must Master now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike and I'll say old preachers and who and and anyone there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability amen if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us that's what it means by mastering the thought of human ability we got to get rid of that thing you say I know how to sing I know how to praise God I know how to do this you got to you got to get rid of that amen you say Lord sing through me Lord Praise Through Me Lord have your way through me Lord that it's not me humanly worshiping Lord may I just be watching you worship through me take over my being Lord this is why people actually are afraid I think in the past people have spoken against the gifts of the Spirit and the message is because people are afraid to actually let go and let God we should not be afraid to let God you know we pray Lord take over my life has he really taken over your life completely no now now in church it's one thing in life it's another thing because you should be able to let him take over your life that if you do something wrong you can put it right amen you don't tell lies you don't do Shady deals you don't do anything that's contrary to his word right you can put it right now in church we should be it's now now what am how am I going to sing this no Lord sing through me sure I may have a gift but Lord take the gift and may I not use the gift may you use the gift see balum would use a gift to try and get money out of the king of Moab to to curse Israel he was using the gift himself he was contacting God God was speaking through him the prophecies are still in the scripture but he was using the gift see we don't want to use a gift in our life we want God to use it amen so we've got to master this thought of human ability so when I talk about the Dynamics of church order like I am we got to realize that that this confir that God confirming our worship is not our ability that makes him confirm it's us yielding ourselves see brother Braham says a gift is actually getting yourself out of the way that's what a gift is getting yourself out of the way and the more you get yourself out of the way the more God can use you use the gift in your life and that's not just for ministry that's for everyone amen amen you see so it's so important that we that that we lay aside this thought well then how do we how do we get to a place where we where we don't get so concerned in our ability and we get into his ability well it's the same thing Make a Joyful Noise to the Lord begin to praise Him forget about yourself forget about your problems forget about what you're going through and the struggles and things and focus on the Lord hope this is okay tonight amen but you know God remember we we worship Jesus Christ here we don't worship our problems our complexes whatever no we're here to Worship the Lord am mean so if you want to get yourself out of the way think of the goodness of God think about what he's done for you how great he is what he means to you and you'll find yourself in a way happier space and you may get a little bit drunk that's good get more drunk on the spirit of God and you may have have yourself a real good time amen hallelujah praise the Lord and we may get out of order long enough till someone gets saved brother BR says that may the church get out of order long enough till someone gets saved what does that out of order mean that people aren't so rigidly holding on to themselves but they let God do what he wants to do amen amen let us make oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms I was going to keep highlighting different parts of this Psalm but I was going to make it all yellow so I just stopped right there for the Lord is is a great God and a great king above all gods in his hand are the Deep places of the Earth the strength of the hills is his also the sea is his and he made it and His Hands form the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker amen amen Psalms 34 a Psalm of David when he changed his uh his behavior before abich who drove him away way and he departed I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth now this is David on the run in the Philistine lands and he's writing this okay this is remember he went before the king of the Philistines and acted like a crazy man to save his own skin he just does this now he's inspired to write this Psalm I Will Bless The Lord at all times didn't you feel foolish David by doing those things I'll bless the Lord at all times you know his pray shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the Lord encampeth about I mean round about them that fear Him and think upon those things cuz you got to realize the Lord has has delivered us out of many troubles because remember the angel of the Lord that's God himself an Angelic form not just the angels of God it says the angel of the Lord who is that the pillar of fire that's God himself he encampeth about them that fear Him amen so so he's your security detail every day of every day of the week amen and he deliver and he deliver them amen so to me that's incredibly important now so so that's the that's the before service and the song service now actually in the in the before service you know we should we should we should keep this place very special right because when he talks about respecting the uh Sanctuary to me it's a it's a it's an attitude thing that we should be very thankful now I'm not saying we take this place for granted but I'm just trying to emphasize something here that we should be very thankful that we have this place amen right hey if we had to be in a hall praise God a house praise the Lord but but we have this place that we don't have to pack up set up pack up set all those things we don't have to do those things amen we have a place we' got Sunday school rooms we've got a foer we got all these different things that we can we can leave here and enjoy but you see this is why we should we should never take this place for granted we should respect this place amen and so so brother B says now I would suggest have your organist to get up there at some real nice music if she can't be there put on a tape then play it or something another and have music real sweet Sacred Music going on see wise out so people come in and meditate on the Lord and think upon him and if the people's goes are talking carry on that let one of the deacons get up at the microphone and say shush whatever you know and say at the Tabernacle here we want you to come to worship let's not make noise now listen to the music get your seat sit down be reverent see pray or read the Bible this is the sanctuary here where the Lord dwells and we want everybody to be real reverent and worship not to be running around talking before service congregate yourselves and you come here to talk to the Lord see either be in silent prayer or read your Bible this is here amen and it says in Psalms here I remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works I Muse on the work of thy hands who is the work of his hands we are you are amen I stret stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land sealer so when we come into church we should meditate upon his works I know I may be repeating myself but I think if we could just not wait till to the end of service to be on a spiritual higher let's just start on a spiritual high and go higher amen hey if you can't if you got kids and you can't be in here or you're late whatever more remember this is not a rule but this is this is the Dynamics behind it okay amen just so important and it's the same thing after service we you know we're not here we're not here to meet one another we got places to meet we're at a foer we can go outside we go next door we you we go on the street but this is not a place to meet especially after service we're not here to sit stand around and talk I know I'm guilty of it myself but let's take all the conversations out the door amen I think I think we shouldn't be letting kids running here sit down talk and all those things we got places to do that am me we can go to people's houses whatever more so we shouldn't we we should because the thing is we know especially in New Zealand we take things very casually we can't take God casually amen we can't we can't take him for granted we should respect them more and more especially as the day approaching where he's going to take us home amen because he's God remember Hallelujah this is not just some Idol this is not some of stone or man's hands this is God who made the body you're living in oh boy he holds your life in his hand he can just hold your breath for for a few minutes and you're gone if he wanted to amen but we have life in these bodies to praise Him amen amen to give him thanks now amen praise the Lord how we going for the time okay we're just going to go through so so this is the Dynamics of it now what we want to do is was is is in every service we want to build the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost amen we want to build it to a climax at the end that's what we want to do so that's why if we come in we're we're we're meditating on the goodness of God we're not thinking forget about the week forget about tomorrow it'll be there amen right even if we even if the dead in Christ raised tomorrow will be there right it may be a different kind of tomorrow than what you're planning but it'll be there okay it's going to be awesome but you see tomorrow will take care of itself okay so don't worry about where you come from what's going on in your life life just focus on the Lord and his goodness and that will get you into a spiritual atmosphere amen amen cuz our hearts have got to connect with him and worship right amen amen so then he says and and then so the songs and I appreciate our song letters but you see so so the songs now bring the congregation bring us into a greater spiritual atmosphere than just sitting and meditating see he says let brother Caps or whoever is leading the songs and have a song leader no matter who it is and don't let them stand up and say or carry on like they're a preacher let them just let them stand up there and Lead songs that's their business why because we want to create an atmosphere where the spirit of God comes down in a greater way have you heard brother Braham sa I'm waiting for the spirit to reach its peak and then I'm going to pray for the prayer cloths and so on right this what we want to do we want to want to build the anointing like brother BR says about you know during the end of a service says I see a real Faith Bank over the building he says it looks all milky I've seen that in places where it actually looks all milky over the people why a faith Bank faith is risen and Faith Rises and then when Faith Rises then people can claim what they need from the Lord and that's what we should really aspire to every service that this is not a natural going on this is a supernatural dealing between us and God where where Faith Can rise in our hearts unbelief can be cast out that we can get the promises get the things that we have need of amen and then and then he speaks about the length of preaching now I'm just going to go through this briefly but he says about 45 minutes is good 4 he says and from 8 to4 to 9 so this is this is I think in the morning or evening I'm not sure somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes lay that word in there just as the Holy Ghost gives it to you see just like that just place it in there right the way he says do it see under the anointing and what is that because we don't want to wear people out right you want to you want to preach now I've already said this to the ministers so I'm just going to say to everyone here we're want to preach in such a way to build the service to a peak and then and then we worship why because then because the whole purpose of this is that people get in contact with God right the most powerful thing on the Earth is not the atomic bomb it's not the Hypersonic missile not the hydrogen bomb it's a man in contact or woman in contact with his maker and that's the whole thrust behind why we have church see amen he says and he says here you see you see for the sanctuary for the church see if you're making a tape and you've got a 2hour tape put a two-hour message on it but you see we're not making tapes right we have a message amen but if you're not making a tape for something like that then cut cut our message see cut your message down I'll tell you why there's some some fill up easy some fill up long see like that and we've got to be at a happy medium between that right so some people got a smaller tank just like a any vehicle on the street a a truck's got a big tank a min's got a real small tank they both have gasoline or diesel or whatever fuel that they need right so some fill up easy some fill up long so you got to find a happy medium that everyone can walk out of here full and happy and good cuz that's what we want to do right we want to leave church feeling better than when we came in it may have been a real hard service maybe the words torn the height off your back and torn the height off the preachers back and everything more but you feel good amen so so we want to walk out and and that's why he's talking about these things is because the Dynamics behind it is not to be short or what we would consider short for short sake is that the atmosphere the faith would rise to a point where people can get what they need from God he says because I found this at a service it stands up and the message is given in the power if you go too far you wear the people out and they don't get it I don't want people to walk out and say what did he preach on he I don't know I think that's kind of a that's not a win I want to have a win are you following me amen this is this is what we want to get right but you see now here comes here comes the point where I really want to get to and this is the whole point for all these things that we've just talked about the Dynamics of it right so so we've come into church we've been meditating on the Lord there's been a a holy spirit anointed pianist or musicians playing or music whatever more so so now we're in a spiritual condition now the song leader gets up greets the people begins to lead in worship and and what's been building up as we've been meditating on the Lord and reading and praying now can burst forth in Praise right for the song service then the minister comes along preaches us into Heavenly places amen and then and then now we're in a real atmosphere of worship it says then after the message is over then if the preacher gives a place in there where the people are all rejoicing the spirit amongst the people perhaps he might send another message if he sends a message it'll come to someone then an interpretation it will not just be a quoting of a scripture or doing something God don't use vain repetitions but it'll be a direct message to somebody to do a certain thing or something that will edify the church so he says if the preacher gives place and I think it's very important we give place to God Amen we let him take over amen remember this is not my show this should be the Jesus Christ if I can put it that way right the whole point of worship is God be exalted that we want a mount Transfiguration experience right that we didn't see Elijah or Moses but we heard a voice from Heaven about our lord Jesus this is my beloved Son hear ye him hear his word we see Jesus Christ glorified amen amen that so after the message is over and all the people are rejoicing right then God can come down the preacher what we give Place God do you want to use a gift in the body do you want to speak in tongues do you want to prophesy do you want to give an exort whatever it may be do you want to do those things Lord amen then there's space for that to happen amen because I believe like brother Braham said that all nine spiritual gifts should be in the local body amen right in the end time this is what we should expect to see all the nine spiritual gifts in the you know we should have it in the body and we have them I believe it but I want to see them be used more because I want to see everyone in spiritual worship amen I honestly every gift come to its position amen not just the ministry not just the musicians but every gift in the body I want to come to its full expression because this message remember is an adoption message it places your places the believer in their position in the body whatever they're ordained to be they to be in that position right so if they so if we're going to be placed in our position whatever gift is in our life should be in full manifestation and that's what we want to see amen so this is what we're looking for and I'm going to I'm just going to finish with that okay but this is the Dynamics of Church order I don't know what you're expecting this Wednesday but there it is okay let's come to church with greater expectation see we can have Services where God just takes over like we've had song services and it's like you just see you just feel the presence of God come down and the people aren't singing anymore it's God singing through everyone then the preacher gets up and it's not him it's God speaking and then in the after service people come up they get what they have need of or they get it in their seat or you know gifts start oper ating why cuz God just takes over that's right and that's what we want to have we want to see it don't we want to see more of him less of us amen we want to see God take over cuz why if we're the bride of Christ it's it's it's not our life see the church has always come musicians come up now please the church Through the Ages has always been trying to dominate over the word right this is why in the L here in age Jesus on the outside of the church is because they took the Creed and dogas of dogmas of man above the word of God but if we let the word of God have preeminence then what the word is can take over and live through our lives and he can do what he wants to do like he did in the early church we're in Bible days friends amen amen so let's um let's stand this evening amen and let's sing on one of them I trust you can say I'm one of them amen amen praise the Lord amen already amen they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name they were baptized in the Holy Ghost service came now what he did for them that day he'll do for you the same I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them
