who's happy to be a Christian amen it's all good hallelujah what do you mean are there any bad things now it's all good hallelujah I mean so let's go to Isaiah 55 we're going to read some scripture there we're going to read one verse from my numbers 14 as well but let's go to Isaiah 55 and verse 6 it says here I'll say I mean when Caleb's here yep good idea seek ye the Lord while he may be found we're gonna go down to verse 12 Caleb siki the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon hallelujah for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return either but water at the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud then it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth out a forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands amen let's go to numbers 14 and in verse 20 for just just one verse here numbers 14 and 24 but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and it followed me fully him will I bring into the land where into he went and his seed shall possess it I mean this just now he's a word of Prayer gracious father Lord we just want to come to you this morning Thanksgiving in our hearts Lord for everything you've done for us Lord thank you for keeping us in the way thank you for your mercies upon us Lord and their God was pray father's we'll read your word I just asked Lord anoint it to speaker and hearer Lord may we may we have a closer walk with you because of the service lord I pray change our lives change our hearts Lord fill us with the Holy Ghost Lord refill those already know you Lord those who are law the devil has lord I pray they'd be loosed in the name of Jesus Christ and father made it be just a jubilee among us I pray and gracious father we also want to remember sister Chantal and her family back home lawyers pray your comfort me in my lord father be their portion Lord just father we thank you Lord we say that you are the God of all comfort Lord it's more than nice words it's a reality may manifest that comfort in their hearts my lord mother Lord Jesus may you grant it and we just want to pray for those who are unwell Lord little Dan you know dear lord is unwell as well father pray you touch him Lord even now father go to go to their place Lord may make him well father and Lord I just want to commit the service into your hands and in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning so I wonder I want to speak I want to kind of continue in a way from from last last Sunday about missing the point but I want to go in a kind of a very different way but you know we we read here where where God said his word shall not return to Him void but it will accomplish that which he sent it to do and and now we're looking at this man called Caleb II know I just want to go from the beginning you know Caleb he didn't miss the point of of Moses ministry you know he he was a man where you know I just want you to just think about it just now we're we're imagine imagine being and so I'm just going to get comfortable that's okay maybe I need to lose you but uh I need to do something there we go okay maybe we'll do this as well over here but you know God you know Jesus would say in John chapter six he says the words I speak to you that spirit in their life so we must understand that there's a principle where the words that we speak it may it doesn't matter who's doing the speaking but there's a spirit that travels on those words and that will manifest it will produce whatever that word is you know the emptying of that being spoken it will produce it so for example you take I don't know if anyone's ever watched you know any any World War two footage but you take a Hitler win you know there was an anointing that came upon that man and and he began to speak you know speak some things and he would he would begin to say about how you know they are the master race and they're the master people and all those different kind of things and he released an anointing upon a nation where they were beaten down from World War one they were you know you know you know they were they were downtrodden the whole you know Europe was in turmoil there was a lot of revolutions and things from will one to World War two you know a lot of fighting going on but he came a man and and and the devil anointed this man and if you ever see him when heat so I just got a I'm kicking a folder it's not good now if you ever see if you ever see footage of him at his political rallies he does not stand like we would we would take a a politician and maybe you know you know stand perfectly well and speak slowly and calmly no he you could see he was anointed who's ever seen footage I mean of Hitler and what he would do is when after he would finish and I'll call it preaching he would say I'm in and that was it and we know in the in the in the Reformed Church the Dutch Reformed Church I don't know what to be like in Germany but that's the last word the preacher would say is amen they finished what they had preached and so now here was a man under demon anointing and he was releasing a word upon a people I mean he was a release and anointing a lot of people and the things that they would never consider doing wiping out the Jews hating other races you know those things before he preached they would have never considered those things but then that spirit came upon them they recognized what they thought they were the master people I mean and that anointing came upon the people and instead the whole nation and they led the world into war that did great brutal things I mean they they taught their people that the Russians were not even human and they did great barbaric things when they invaded Russia why because an anointing came upon them through words I mean it's through words you take you take you know Karl Marx who is the founder of what were you know you know you know the communist thought he's actually buried and I'm in England and and if you go read about him though you know his his close followers there some of them were so convinced if they just publish this thing throughout Europe there being a immediate revolution they were so gripped why because an anointing was being released through words a spirit was being released through words amen and it's the same thing today even right now every word you hear there's a spirit behind that and it wants you to do certain things it has agendas the devil has an agenda God has an agenda amen but it's who you open yourself up to as that's what you'll manifest because not everyone in Nazi Germany actually became caught up in it you know there's a photo if you've seen oh I don't have it on me but there's a there's like um there's a whole photo of a crowd they're all giving the Hitler salute but one man he's like this he didn't get caught up he didn't get caught up what was going on he wasn't he didn't open himself up to that spirit I don't know who he is I don't know if they even know here's I say God bless that man least he had a better gumption to not just float with the tide we don't want to just go with the flow everyone else is doing oh it's cool it's trending who cares about trending I mean I want to do what God wants me to do that's trending that's eternal trending holy the hashtag never gets all that ever changes know what God does is the trending thing hallelujah so now we see so sir a word so so words spirits travel onwards hallelujah you know but then you take so for example if you go look at history you go look at the First Crusade how did they form the First Crusade who knows about the Crusades they preached around Europe and England preaching about crusade because that was the that was the most effective way of transmitting an idea was preaching because they don't have the printing press in those days they couldn't quickly you know duplicate things like it could and yolu Thursday so it was preaching was the most effective way they went around Europe preaching we've got to take the Holy Land back what happened they released an anointing why didn't they think about doing it before because a demon got in those people because it's political powers under under the veil of religion and then so they went around preaching we're gonna take the holy land back take it back from the Muslims whatever and then they started the crusade and they did barbaric things they even ate people crazy stuff all under the name of religion brought heaven and anointing was released why do people go you know we just had Isis raise up and it's doing whatever it's done and now it's done people from from from Europe they get suddenly radicalized have no history of Islam and their family they get really radicalized the next thing they know they go disappearing and then they're driving a suicide truck in Syria blowing themselves up why what happen they win on meat now there's nothing wrong with this device just like there's nothing wrong with the printed printed material you know it's not the it's not the medium that's the thing it's the words or the spirit behind what's being transmitted I mean so there's nothing wrong with this it's what's being trimmed transmitted through this is the problem right so now you see people you know everyone knows about it hey people from Europe they disappeared where they go they end up young people not just old young people why what happened somehow they found themselves looking because it because it's evolved from speech to video or tape now it's on the internet and people are watching films of Isis and what the spirit grabs them and it anoints them and something that would never have considered doing now they want to be a suicide bomber in Syria or in Iraq why because there's a spirit traveling on a word I meant this thing is now many people you know they think you know a lot of us can't survive in the bush I'll say I'm included I couldn't survive in this bush I'll die I you know I know how to find maybe the north yo you know North is pointing in well I in here I know you know currently the bark is thicker on one side of the tree and you know in here I've heard about it but I've never tried it you know but I would die cuz I'm not used to the environment I don't know how to survive there but the problem is very few of us know how to survive in this world you know out there sure you know these things that maybe can kill you you know if you go out there in the roar stag would have a go you may be a wild pig whatever you know but there's demon power in this place here you know and we have to know how to survive and overcome in this world amen because if we are not you know if we just walk you're you take some you know you take some animal where is it brother Chris you know who saw that footage there's that piglet and it's got its head and that dirt and he's and he's walking up behind it who saw that you know and this pig is oblivious of what's going on here's a man he doesn't have a gun he's got a Camrys trying to grab this pig this pig had no idea there was someone creeping up on him cuz he was just caught up on what he was doing and if brother Chris had a knife or a gun hey we would have had some we would have had some book you know he would have brought home the bacon but many of us are like that pig the devil put something out eat this oh it's so good because it pandas to the flesh sinners enticing it's engineered to to this thing likes it it's enticing so it's like you know that pig find some grub it's got its heat in the dirt having a wonderful time it thinks it doesn't know it could die he even got it by one of the league's it was it was that close some of us sometimes the devil's got a spy League why cuz he's put something out in front of us and we're all this is wonderful this is what I'm looking for now what's happened we've watched something a spurt yeah because I remember when I was flaring now you know my flatmates were Christians they will caught up and and shows like home-and-away Shortland Street I hope none of you really know what those are but they became so involved in the show they were shocked how could this person cheat on this one and this one did this ELISA and it's fictitious it's it's a drama so it can't just be you know none of those shows would be successful so they go to work how's your day this happened you know then they go home and you do this yo no one would watch that stuff it's a drama but they got so emotionally involved with what they're watching they were shocked ha I have the IQ and they were talked about and they were emotionally involved with the show they say ah but that's the last generation but now we go on YouTube hello youtubers how are you today today I'm going to do this and and people get emotionally involved with what the influences are doing and they think they're having a relationship people think they having relationship with this person on the internet know do they know who you are they don't know who you are they don't really care about you all they wanted to do is make money and become famous because they have they have selfish ambition that's all they want to do they're not interested in you and your welfare ah but we'll respond to your comments you you take some of the most famous youtubers out there do you think they have physically you know it was us you know how YouTube tries to get you to watch yo things that you don't even sit in there's this one one that came up and there was a trick shot with a plane 127 million views 127 million views of the sky throwing this plane going through this loop and hitting this guy in the stomach hundred twenty seven as are men that's cool and they say subscribe to my channel post a comment do you think they have physical time to reply to those comments they have some Leckie writing means it's not the person hello have you thought about this but it's just like my flatmates were the TV show now it's people on YouTube it's just evolved what's happened a spirit and stairs people and they don't want to and now they can't function in in reality you know the World Health Organization I'm just this is this is Here I am the World Health Organization 28th of May this year declared officially recognized a gaming disorder as mental health issue so computer gaming they recognized it as they call it a gaming disorder and it's when it's and it's when people place their need for gaming above other activities so what's that that's the same as gambling same as alcoholism same as taking drugs why do people why do people basically get you know they get hooked on methamphetamine or any other drug they will rob their own mother and if they could sell her they would to get money for that drug why because now that there's a spirits come upon them why did why did people take your ancient religions they took drugs to contact the spirit world I I had to I had to do research I had to sit tests because you know how I do drug testing I had to sit here written tests in order to to to be able to be qualified to release results because I release results that were given and so I had to study at least he and methamphetamine and fit I mean all these different drugs pseudoephedrine you know and a lot of them a lot of them came out of universities they actually tested them within the University and the people that first took the max he had a spiritual experience they said they weren't religious people but they had the spiritual awakening well it happened cause this cuz it cause it opened their spirit round to have a spiritual experience with a demon you take me 10 feet of me and stuff like that do you know where that became big it was given to soldiers in World War because it because it is a stimulant it was actually state-sponsored drug taking and now here's the problem now now it's gone through the world as a moneymaker but what's happened so drag taking stuff it's an addiction but it opens you up to a spirit world that's why shamans and stuff they take marijuana because I want to get in touch with the spirits and they did right and it's the same thing but but that's addiction what's happening a spirit comes into a person and and that spirit has feeding on that thing I mean just like I was an alcoholic there was a there was a desire in me to have it it wasn't like I was totally neutral I y'all have it today not know there was a genuine thirst I got I need a beer where is one I'm gonna have one you have quite jug Monday you start on Wednesday then you here take a break Thursday then you're back on Monday again why cuz there's a hunger and a thirst that's why you know you got to see what's driving you to do the things you do what's true what drove the Nazis to kill the Jews a spirit what motivated them they weren't just it wasn't a stab in the dark thing they used IBM punch hole machines to actually plan the whole thing and it was actually been proven without that technology they couldn't have been so efficient and and and mass murder they planned it they actually did test to see the most effective way to kill people well it's having a spirit god on people with most of our medical researchers come from the Nazi scientists because they didn't value the humans that they're testing it on there were just objects to them why cuz the spirit got on people what what you know because it's not human for people to to one day others a human being next day this is not a human being it's a spirit actually clouds people's judgement so what about you know as I've said before there's this there's I don't know how many tens of thousands of young men and and and Japan they call the hick amore they they withdraw from society they live in it and you know with the appearance in a bedroom and come out they just play video games all day just on the internet all day and there's people there trying to try to get them out of this what's having a spirits come upon them and they see no way out because the devil never gives you a way out he never gives you a way to overcome he always says no this is you or you're stuck this way your mouths are just here you are here's your prison cell enjoy this you know this you say well this isn't a New Zealand that's very much here it's very much here people are so people you know I know people that you know in my day there's a game called World of Warcraft I don't care if it's still there people quit University to play the game that's a gaming disorder they became hooked nothing wrong with the computer nothing wrong with the Internet it's the what's coming through it I mean you say well we can't stop it no you can't stop it but you gotta have discernment what are you looking at that's the biggest thing we need lord teach us between right and wrong you be the inside teacher I mean it shouldn't be our parents telling us what to do what not to do the Holy Ghost should be in our life so strong as soon as you look at it something and you should say that's wrong I don't like that that's disgusting amen the things I once did I can't do no more because he changed my appetite I used to love rock and roll you know me and my friends we prided ourselves and listening to bands before they became big we thought we were cool we weren't cool we were just going with the flow but I can't listen to that stuff no no not because it's all I got a keep away from it no it's not in here I don't like it it's my my desires changed yes a lord changed my desire change my what I like and not like that's it's not us trying to reform ourselves and put some measures in place and you know know God's going to change the desire brother band was us he said what can I do with my young boys you know take them out on the streets all these trip teens and stuff he says I don't know but get them to Christ get the Holy Ghost in their lives and they'll be okay hallelujah amen so you know we got a we're going to look at these things for for what they are you mean well I just need to be entertained that's the problem you know I'm sure my dad will see this they see it stopped being brain dead playing computer guy used to play a lot of computer games watching TV and if I was this generation I would you know I would have been on YouTube bouldering playing whatever it's not being brain did and that's what it is you just passively ooh you know because you don't have to it's just you know and the problem is I remember you know mommy you know - Steve that's all right the problem is with with with films as it's the inspiration that goes upon the director has now forced upon you and you can't unsee it but the thing is with a book now I'm not can you just got to have your own discernment but with the book if you've never seen it before then your own imagination limits really what you see they meant I remember you know but then you got to be careful like I remember being 15 years old reading Harry Potter whooshing man I'd love to go to Hogwarts now honestly I remember I was like men what what happened a spirit got me I spirit got me out of a book I was so a grip does like man I'd love to go I was already at boarding school I thought well I just need one more step you know no but I was not I'm being honest I said man I'd love Lovelace I found a bit of Hogwarts I found a better you know it's not a bunch of demon power magic no the Holy Ghost halia God's power in your life I mean some of you looking at me like what do you where you going with this I mean I found a better world a better life since the thing we're going to continue on the that was once delivered to the Saints it's not nearly this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong no this is glorious this is glorious this is glorious it produces what it sees the producers that changes lives and set you free amen at transform it's worth that it's glorious hallelujah I love being drunk on the spirit I've said it before I've been staying around like I'm drunk I feel drunk Holly but none of the perverseness whatsoever I know aside to be high on the Spirit of God I learned adjoin springle full of glory can't contain it just comes for Hollow hallelujah amen I became addicted to something else hallelujah amen so you know we should continue this is a reality to this I mean it's not just a nice idea it's not just a way to live it is a reality I mean eternal life is real I mean the Holy Ghost is real overcoming powers real the joy of the Lord is real it's our strength to tie everything hallelujah I mean his piece of puzzle understanding how do you feel peaceful at this moment I don't know but it's his peace hollowly I don't understand it that passes my understanding I mean how can you stand I don't know he's making me stand hallelujah why because he released a word amen and then that word came into your soul I mean his spur came anointed that word hallelujah then a different spur is with you now hallelujah Amen you take well just I'll just read this this well like I print stuff out because hey I can jump around now brother Brahim sees this and marriage of the Lamb here's why I know here not long ago minister told me he send out so many cards to get people to sign that pledge to come to Sunday school at least six months out of every year and I've seen a little old girl down below the hill there where I've been working and she come out of there and I was standing at the door knocked at the door she came to the door and she was some of these here world kept players you know like this bunch they had to have a rest that I mean down here in Phoenix last night I believe it was doing this new kind of rock and roll or twisters whatever it was and they had to get the cops to come get them you fix he says young folks don't you understand that that is the spirit of the devil under the influence - they don't know what they was out on the streets carrying on some like some of these comedians or these record players or jockey so forth I mean going to play in a city and the young ladies taking off their underneath clothes throw it on the platform for these boys to autograph don't you realize that's the devil that's the spirit of last days of such a shame there you go gone wild this young woman she came out carrying on she didn't even know forgot me standing at the door and she said oh pardon me I forgot you about you standing there and she throat a kiss to that God in the radio or whatever it was she said I'll meet you out at the Greenbrier patch or whatever it was they was going to have Scylla some kind of a dance that night and I said to dr. Brown which was a friend of mine how is your congregation holding out their belief I said fine I give them pills he said what kind of pills I said Gospels that sure keeps them coming all the time see and he told me about that signing those pledges I said dr. Brown do you think of that wildcat player on that radio would have to make that girl sign a pledge that she'd be ever over there that night not at all she had porn what clothes she had to get there why it's something in her that's connected her a spirit to that worldly amusement and until the Church of the Living God that's called the Bride of Christ gets herself connected with God like that she'll still wallow in the world and the miry clay of sin until she's connected with God in such a way till her heart is so filled with glory and power of God till she can't see nothing else but Christ that's right that's what we have to do that's the only plan that's the only program God has is to do a thing like that you've got not to be artificially took in you've got to be born again not shook in or get a letter to the church to be born in a church the Living God by regeneration by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that makes you a new creature and heard Amen that straightens it up it sure does hallelujah see that girl no one had to come alongside now you've got to listen to this negative that's not the spirit and it was now in her she she was united with it that's why she died she carried on she didn't care because the spirit in her was connected with it amen how much more us friends hallelujah because the thing is we're going to recognize we don't just grow into this I mean we don't just grow into the Holy Ghost no we're going to meet him I mean I believe in a different experience I mean I believe in a different meeting with God I mean Moses didn't imagine he met God he met God I mean Joshua didn't imagine he meant they kept her to the hosts he meant they kept in the house the Apostle Paul didn't imagine he meant the pillar of fire he meant the pillar of fire I he's the same yesterday today and forever amen we have to have a meeting with him hallelujah and that will change our whole lives hallelujah and if you've had that meeting Amen you should be the boldest Amen let nothing stop you let nothing push you to one side I mean you should know who you are hallelujah Amen you see because you know this promise in the and you're in the book of Ephesians where we would say in Ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and loved having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace and Heath made us accepted in the beloved hallelujah said now so so we have blessings all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ now he said that we have been produced I'm just repeating myself now I'm still talking about what I've just spoken about ok but now there's a challenge now where he says if we have predestined to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself now we know that this adoption is a placing of a child and a family right so it's not me going to China getting a Chinese baby writing some letters and say now she's a glowing or he's a glowing no it's a child that's been born into my family but comes to an age where they become placed in the family that what they say as good as what I say I mean because the same mind that's in me is in them that's the same thing with us in the Lord Jesus Christ I mean we're born into the kingdom of God holy but now God places us in the body of Christ I mean that now what we say hallelujah is what he would say and because now we are in our position of authority in Christ maybe but it's his doing I mean Ephesians 1 and 17 that God that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and the revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope and we know hope in the Bible's expectation with pleasure of his calling hallelujah and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us would who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above all principality power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all now we know a living person you can't separate the head from the body otherwise that person becomes dead yeah real real rule you you decapitate 100% of decapitations it up and death amen that's just how it does so so if you take the head from the body it's no longer a living being I mean but we're a living church we're living stones lively stones I mean so that means where the head is the body is also I mean if the head is at the right hand and heavenly places everything's under his feet I mean that means the body must follow the head how this to where the head is that where the body is they meant off he is the head is over all things he has two men you know for all things every work of the devil hallelujah every spirit I mean everything that's that can be named is under his feet I mean that the body of Christ is in the same position hallelujah I'm in it and and this is what he sees in Ephesians two and five I just want you to realize your position hallelujah Caleb had to recognize who he was I mean in the real I and the reason he realized who he was because he recognized I mean that there's a place in the promised land for him Holly that his inheritance was in the land Amen he knew he was the son of God hallelujah even so even so there's Ephesians two and five so when we are did and since it's quickened us together in Christ by grace you're saved and it's raised us up and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus but we have to understand that there's someone else trying to take our take our position I mean as as as the devil would would basically dethrone Adam Eva's being god of the earth hee-hee-hee dethrone them through deception and I just want to say this and and and and brother first said this to me and I thought it was real good the serpent goes to Eve and says if you partake of this fruit we know by your fruits you'll know them as an act you shall know good and evil they knew good then they know good they're in the god man you God why did they need to know evil what was the purpose ah you'll know evil and you know good and evil she should have stopped and thought but I already know good what can evil do to me what can evil do and that's the problem as the devil never revealed to her the consequence of what she was about to do he just paint something oh you'll know this oh you'll see what the world's really all about whoo he never showed her you gonna die there's gonna be every death every every piece of pain everything was was was resulted from that one act that was about to happen and you know things are put out Netflix YouTube Hollywood you know I can't say Hollywood no more because we've moved on right you know if I said Oz you know all these movies many of you think well man this guy's old I don't go to the movies I have it here you know but the thing is they have it people go in these films from relationship root 2 to relationship take one use them throw them out the next day there now there was someone else they never show the emotional damage and scars and pains because of that lifestyle the world will never show you them they will never ever show you that because if it don't show you that then anyone with the right mother say well it's not worth it I mean who wants who wants a whole bunch of pain and regret and scars and complexes and hurts because of things you did under the influence of the yo-yo of the devil know on what's there but Hollywood you know your entertainment doesn't show you those things I mean it it just puts it out this is a successful life and even just goes after all this is wonderful now I am there carrying all this pain and baggage and the world's broken you gotta look at as I see it about Hitler the whole nation was changed because a man Hollywood preachers Netflix preachers YouTube is preaching there's a message behind the message amen it's changing people's perception about things a minister's brother Steve Bruce Aune preached about the evolution of Lucifer or something and he's saying now Hollywood is trending these robots and everything now because the end goal that they wanted was I want to merge man and machine that's what they want to do and they've wanted to do it for decades that's what they wanted because they want eternal life they think they can merge you you know imagine that you get merged with a machine you can't die that's what they think they're trying to basically make a false new birth I mean they're trying to make a false eternity because the devil always tries to pervert what God wants to do I mean so so if so if God says I'm gonna send you a word it's going to give you a body change well what do they do they try and change your body by machine I'm gonna try and give you a glorified body by merging man with machine it's on its way it's on its way things are by design i watch the you know you know the owner of amazon gift bizarre whatever his name is you know he was 10 years old Amazon started off as an online bookstore it was never about selling books it's about harnessing the Internet to make money and he's he created a company about five years ago called Blue Origin do you know what it does do I know space travel space travel they have Rockets they have a lunar lander they're going to the moon they want to go to the moon they're already deploying satellites into space because when he was 10 years old he saw Neil Armstrong stand on the moon he said I'm gonna I want to do that but do you think his in goal is Mars or the moon no they want to create giant space stations and space where people live that's what he wants to altameyer he said his generation won't do up of the next generation will what happened he came under the influence of so he saw an image he saw an image of a man standing on a moon and something gripped him saying I want to be part of this and now of his energies you just take you take you know you take the technology they just have in their distribution centers just to get you your package in five days it's incredible but all that energy is not about selling stuff it's about making money to do other things right but he saw an image and it gripped them and his whole life is built around it I trust you've seen more than an image but a living God and loving God in this day and he's gripped you something and you said yes hallelujah I'm gonna whatever his word says Lord manifested in me Polaris brothers I said they have faith they believe they can do it then they actively work on that faith and created amen and if that is at it you know if that's fallen man your season Genesis 11 about the Tower of Babel God scattered them because least because anything that let's just find it shall we let's go to Genesis 11 I want you to think about this verse 6 of Genesis 11 and the Lord said is everyone there and the Lord said Behold the people is one they all have one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do so nothing would be restrained from them which they have imagined to do what do you your man you know Amanda what does man imagine immortality space travel time travel : izing planets you think about it this is God saying this maybe it wasn't even NIMS you know all they wanna do is build a tower to escape God's judgment but guys actually I didn't find you know this man these men can actually do anything they imagined and what's happening now man has come together our imagination is not limited anymore you think about it I don't know about 500 years ago I don't know if they imagine space travel and building rockets and living you know you know merging themselves with machinery and things I don't know if they mention those things they do now and the thing is you take what is the universal language of science it's English that's English well it's happening languages are coming together for certain purposes they're being used for certain purposes to bring their to bring the world together to do what they want to do what about what God wants to do hallelujah we've come under one language amen the Word of God hallelujah where we have a heavenly language hallelujah amen so now here they are wanting to do why because they're being gripped by something and that now they actively pursue it now as as I said but there is there is others that are possessing your position because heavenly places our position in Christ right so the devil doesn't want you to take your position he wants us he wants us to be like the hick amore you know the meaning and young people in Japan or all sealed away in their room you know just living through a screen that's what he wants us to do that's not us taking our position now it's the world having dominion over people I mean to that so that's what he wants to produce that's not us taking our position that's actually demon power controlling people I mean but we've got to kick them out hallelujah the preaching of the gospel is actually that the Spirit of God comes down the demons come off people they can actually receive Christ I mean that's what preaching does hallelujah it moves the devil away their people then come to their right mind actually receive Christ hallelujah that's the purpose of having church I mean we you know we can't be ignorant to the fact you know you know we think people in straightjackets you know in in padded rooms are demon possessed or demon tormented now they're on the street amen and you can be tormented by the devil doesn't mean you're possessed by it but devil who's been troubled in their mind I mean I could even say who's heard voices and other it's not your voice thinking it's actually other voices men or women's voices saying in your mind speaking to you who said that that's a devil trying to get a hold of you I mean it doesn't mean you're crazy remember this is no man's land this is the battlefield the devil doesn't you know he doesn't just sit back and say okay God you can have it no he's aggressive maybe just like remember when we had our first camp there's that meeting God just came down and the devil told sister Chantal you're not part of this how brazen the devil is God's moving people are rejoicing he just comes down plays on someone's fear says no this is not for you but we know the end result he got kicked out in it's a victory hallelujah but the devil plays on your own fear well it's a doorway oh I'm afraid this might happen all this could happen because of insecurity and fear no that's not what that's not what this is about me I mean why should we worry about insecurity feel this my hip at all I don't really fit it no I fit in if you're believing you for it hallelujah amen hallelujah you know so we shouldn't worry don't leave the devil you got to close that door I mean because remember the devil doesn't just go no he tries to force the door what about this and this may happen and this is see they're doing that and he'll actually point out things people are doing they say look they're doing it see I told you oh yeah place you up you know that's it yeah it's just like Hollywood it done these shows you a screen you go off camera what happens off camera drugs broken lives people have that you know broken people but that's not on camera that's off camera but then we see what's on camera or on YouTube you know is you know these influences they have their this I've got eating disorder people take their lives or horrible things happen because that happens off YouTube when they stop broadcasting that's the real them but when they go you know but then they put on their YouTube face and have the lighting just right and you know then they go hi youtubers you know today we're gonna look at this and you know you know what it's fake its fake Instagram 99% of its fake you know it's been filtered through something you know how long it took them to position that perfect photo to take it and they're trying to just pretend others as me and I just woke up and this is how things up know it's been staged but yet we look at a stage life and we want to go oh I want this life you can't have it because it's not real that's why people become so depressed and broken and down because they cannot obtained a stage life because it's not real life I mean that's why it's a problem of fairness that people want to live in a fantasy world the devil wants you in a fantasy world because you can never be contended happy with what you have amen you take your notes incredible it's incredible where where Israel is journeying through the wilderness and they say if we only had the fish and the garlic and the leeks in Egypt I have to eat this Menna this angel food they were they were off we could only go back and eat the fish from the Nile if we can only season things with garlic and have leaks and oh you remember those mama you remember that wonderful fish used to bacon how good it wasn't on the garlic and you know they forgot that their babies were being fed to crocodiles they forgot that they were slaves they forgot they had no rights I mean they forgot they were just been used and abused I mean by the Egyptians they forgot those things why cuz the devil never tells you what he you are delivered from he always perverts your memory to try and take you back to something I mean that's not even real because do you think that they would go back what if they said all year let's go get some fish let's go get some garlic and leeks they go to you know Border Patrol in Egypt welcome to Egypt you know anything to declare purpose of visit holiday gives them the passport Jewish slaves they would have been thrown into the slavery put whatever but in their mind that all we just going back for a meal you know and people get so caught up don't be don't be drummed dumb dumb driven cattle don't be a target for the devil we're here to torment him not him us I mean he's meant to be under our feet not him under your outsider his feet amen so that people you know the devil never tells you the bad the scars they were carrying the scars of the whips and the beatings and the trauma but then the devil twisted their memory in such a way I want fish again let's go back and get fish friends we shouldn't be that way we should remember where we came from because God set us free from that if it's being a proud proud and religion from the world whatever it is we should always remember what it did because it's not glamorous amen you should always wear there's no glamour in the world if it's so glamorous why do people kill themselves why they on drugs why they take overdoses and all those things you know show me them do those things why why because it's empty it is torment it's broken amen so friends we don't want to have that kind of mindset oh I wish I could get out no Caleb you know you just imagine I just think about it yesterday imagine imagine you know going into the case oh we're in there in the wilderness we go to the murmurous tent the ones who aren't happy they want to go get fish imagine the conversation around the table okay children dinnertime oh I'm sick of this manner you know complaining you know and then any no doubt the dad the mom going yeah I know but we're stuck here and your Moses brought us out here and we what if we try and go back now we'll get killed by those other guys tried to take the land and we just stuck here who I'm sick of this and all the sun's hot and this is a little terrible and do you think would have been like that they weren't happy they weren't going praised in love with me you know yeah yeah when God told them no because the spies you believe the spies report you're gonna be here 40 years and the wilderness told this generation dies that doesn't go hallelujah Whoopie they wouldn't have been happy about it they would have been complaining we're stuck here we can't get out of here I want to get out of here I want fish I want garlic's I want leeks I want to do this but then you go over to Caleb's team hallelujah you think about do you have you thought about it he's living under a promise I'm gonna take my land the place I saw hallelujah hallelujah hey short I want it God I want it give it to me you thinking about it hallelujah they get there on the dinner table Oh hallelujah children hallelujah children how's your day glorious what do you mean it was glorious it was hot it was windy not praise all over on our way I mean we're a day closer hallelujah we're a day closer I mean the promise is becoming more real tell us about the land again dad well I tell you what I was walking around the grass was green Holly are there rivers there fields I mean the old mountains there's hills I mean two of us had to pack out of one one bunch of grapes hell it was so big we had to pack it out two of us I mean the honey was sweet I mean it was glorious and you know the most amazing thing children what's it it's house hallelujah meows yes yes yes children we're going and they would about the hit you know what's so wonderful what's so wonderful God feeds us every day hallelujah God feeds us everyday you know this is angels food yes angels food has us here even eating us before you mean we get the angels food hallelujah holy house those shoes you've been kept walking him for forty years they're still good how's the clothes on your back they're still strong how you feelin feeling real good hallelujah hallelujah what a different atmosphere because he was another spirit was with him hallelujah hallelujah but now I want you to notice now he didn't just settle for any place in the promised land oh and I'm gonna wanna listen he didn't he didn't just sit off or any place he when he was there when he was there at Mount Horeb and Moses would take the word and he would sprinkle the word I'm in the book and the people with the blood of cows and goats and water and Scarlett wood and hyssop they see is this is the blood of the test in which the with yo-yo which God hath enjoined unto you what does God was doing his taking the blood and spring sprinkling the promised Word and connecting it to the people that they would inherit what's in the book hallelujah so here he was you know many of them didn't receive it because it wasn't mixed with faith I mean you got to mix the word you hear with faith you got to believe it say this is for me I don't know how it's gonna happen but I believe it's gonna happen I mean this is my portion that now when he when he was there in the promised land he was not looking just for any place in the land I mean he wasn't he wasn't satisfied he didn't want to be on the wrong side of Jordan with with with monaster and whatever who were there he didn't want to be there he didn't want to be in any certain place he wanted a mountain he wanted a certain mountain I mean that's what he wanted when he saw that mountain you know cuz no doubt you know they would have had history of you know of the late Abraham was there Isaac was there so maybe Caleb and Joshua were spying out the land they see they see this place maybe maybe Caleb would say to Joshua Joshua what's that mountain something enemies moving hallelujah and Caleb would say you know that they that that mountain I hear was the place where where where Abraham would buy a parcel of ground hallelujah and he bought it from the from the people of the land he buried as his bride in that place hallelujah he wasn't they want to give it to him but he said no I'm gonna buy this place I'm gonna buy a better place for my bride hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah something stirred in I'm saying I want to live there I want to live on that place you know that was spiritual people they weren't just looking for anywhere they weren't just looking for a nice family they weren't just looking for a maybe a better way to live or maybe a nice group of people to to to assemble with they're looking for a resurrection I miss the same thing yours the same thing with us you know we don't just we don't we're not just believers because we can or because it sounds cool or it's a bit different no it's not because he knew it was like Joseph when he's about to die see it's don't leave take my bones with me take my bones with you don't bury me here sure I'll be in a casket but when you leave and you will bury me in that place hallelujah I mean and and and Abraham was buried there and Isaac was buried there he still was buried there too but I don't think I don't think it did him any good right but you know there were people living under the promise were buried in that resurrection place because they knew out of the Promised Land Christ was going to come the resurrection was going to come out of that land hallelujah Elysa Caleb said I want that place and when he went in and he said to finally after all of his years of fighting he said to Joshua I'm 84 years old or 85 years old I'm as strong now as I was when I first came out and you know I fully followed yeah I fully served the Lord I've wholly followed the Lord my God give me my Mountain give it to me and Joshua said go take that place take that place and he took it and it became Hebron and Hebron is with a Cave of Machpelah is where where Abraham Isaac Jacob and Sarah are buried I mean so he took his resurrection mountain hallelujah and he was buried in that place as well hallelujah why because he knew out of that land the resurrection wasn't coming out of the world out of Egypt it was coming out of that Promised Land at that mountain hallelujah so he didn't see it all just for anything he took he took what below what he believed was belonging to him and it should be the same thing oh I'll come back to principalities powers and whatever and later another date but he didn't see it all just for second best or third best he settled for the best amen and it should be the same thing with us you know the Welsh revival started with a young girl standing up at a prayer meeting saying be glorified in me or something God came down a young person started a revival God used it the Welsh revival was a young person think about it amen it's not old it's not the mums and dads it's the young people the devil you know I heard a um I think it's I think it was in Taranaki or somewhere but back in the day they had people you know with the department of Converse conservation don't have hunters go hunt pests and they used to tag up wild pigs because the wild pigs would kill the Lambs as soon as they're born they would actually eat them as soon as they were born and when I thought about that I thought you devil you target the young you target the weak you target the ones who don't know you target them I think you you filthy devil how dare you try and kill our young that's the young that have the strength that's the young that have the ability hallelujah that's the young I mean that God wants to take you you take that younger generation that went over Jordan took the promised land mainly young people it wasn't the older was the young people sure they were the old thereof you're like Caleb and Joshua but it was the young Amen but then the problem as the devil comes along with though what you could do in life you could be this you could be this you can be a great person you could be like them you know I was thinking about you take any great big sports team people become under the anointing that's on that team they buy the shirts they you know they become big fan boys do the players care about them they don't care he comes the great big gods out on the soccer field and you know they're screaming their lungs out the players don't care about them do the managers care about them all they care about is getting the money all they care about is what what can I get out of my you know even the people that you know it's like any big business they don't really care about you the worker you you you you either fulfill your role that they want you to fulfill if you are surplus to requirements you're kicked out so if you don't fulfill what you want them to do you're gone that's that simple and you take that in any realm of life sporting business whatever it may be they don't really care about us amen and that's how the devil works he doesn't care about you he just wants to use you and then off you go but how God doesn't like that how God doesn't just use us and then then then throw us in the trash when we no longer we're past our expiry date that's not how it works he cares about us I mean he became one of us hallelujah we're not just there like a bunch of fans sitting in the crowd young yeah you know no no God doesn't use us that way but we have to we have to come to a place and realize you know this world just wants to use us and abuse us whether you like it or not you mean there's so much good in this world there is but you got to be careful don't let it use and abuse you it'll give you all the promises but what's your price what's your price some people sell out for very little very small some sell out for very big but you know I would not I would not be sold but only for one thing the blood of Jesus Christ that was the only thing that I allowed to buy me when I came to my right mind a lot of other things tried to buy me but I came to a point where is only the blood can buy me and the devil can't match that bid hallelujah he can't match that bird I mean but if you put a value upon yourself that's very low he can match anything but it comes to a point who seen an auction great big famous things being sold and he's a bidding war goes on eventually one has to pull out because he can't afford it no more same thing with the devil he came to a point I can't I can't even come near this bird he tried to bluff it no doubt you know some people you know they but just to raise up the price to get the other person to pay more true but you know but the devil had to come to a point say I can't I can't buy this bride hallelujah I can't buy it why because there's nothing that can match the value of the blood of Jesus Christ so let's just let's just finish there we'll come back to another time but friends don't don't don't sell out for something that's really know of no value Amy let's have the musicians please sorry brother Jeremy I got the you come leave the singing because I don't know with my voices I mainly stand shall
