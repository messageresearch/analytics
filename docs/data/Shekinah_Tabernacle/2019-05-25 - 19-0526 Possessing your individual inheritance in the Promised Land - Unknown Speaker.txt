I'm a good lots of quotes so bear with me but these are manner praise the Lord alright so the title of my as a change this morning is possessing your individual inheritance in the promised land possess in your individual inheritance in the promised land where's the Lord so ok let's not keep you trained for too long Josh Atwell 14 from verse 16 verse 6 you chose Joshua the computer if you got to see him and I think problem we say all right so then the tune of Judah came onto Joshua in Galilee and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Canada the Kenna's I said unto him don't know as the theme that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh Barnea ma just like see doubtless what what problems said consonant me in this land in this day hallelujah so forty years old was I when Moses the sound of the Lord sent me from conspirators to spy out the land and I brought him world again as it was in my heart brother it was in his heart were just not making it up amen and Crispin actually means like secret dessert or wondering so we don't want to be in in cadiz been I want to go right into the land nevertheless my brethren they went up with me may the heart of the people melt but I wholly followed the Lord my God and Moses swept on that day saying surely the land whereon that feet have trod him shebeen inheritance and their children's forever because that was holy for the Lord my God and now behold the LORD hath kept me alive as I said this forty and five years he will see the Lord speak this word optimises addition of Israel wanted the wilderness and now lo I am this day for schoo and five years old 85 years old when he was 40 amen so we are just getting started man hallelujah so nice no no place who gets to get you know to get discouraged praise the Lord Amen as yet I am strong as yet I am a strong this day as I was needed a Moses sent me as my strength was this was then even so is my straight now for war I think our brother was praised they were not here to play but if there is not playing and we are not playing hallelujah go help me this morning for war okay but to go out in the coming now Joshua now therefore give me this mountain where are the lost speck in that day for the headers in that they have the anakims were there and this and the end that the cities we are great and fails if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drag them out as the Lord has said no way there was a not discouraged killer from going for his Mountain hallelujah um talked about this day and age that's enough to start to stop any believer from reaching out to what God has promised you well look at Keller prison Lord hallelujah and Joshua my Joseph mine no just a tad the Holy Ghost no this man was blown they couldn't help but open wounds of heaven hallelujah I hate you today can he do today you see the same today they ask what you will hallelujah and Joshua blessed him I gave and gave on to care of the son of death near Hebron for inheritance Hebron we offer became the hedges of caleb it's not Japanese they can genocide on to this day because he wholly followed the Lord but of Israel shall we turn to 2nd Peter the one they don't play chapter 1 verse 3 according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises brother the war hasn't they that's not in what can offer them can we compare with this that by this you've might be partakers of divine nature having escaped the corruption as in the world - lost lost of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life morning we may a man popularity name it and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to know temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and the working kind of charity well if this is being you and abound they make you that ye may neither you shall neither be barren this is very important on fruitful and annoy to follow Jesus Christ for he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and a forgotten that he was purged from his old scene may God bless into this world those Christ's name please be seated he shared the the special number this morning was beautiful sanctum blessing its Lord thank you so once again I bring my greetings to everyone I'm so hungry this morning and welcome to husband the lord I just pray that God will help us this morning forgive my a saint or whatever those focus and here from your feel funny where's the Lord amen so how many appreciate our brother and this message on Sunday [Applause] in fact I am going to come behind in this one by grace of God and because what can we give God tell me will you bid him your house they say what's a cat I will give to me it what telling them you say you know go see those in the old testamental they getting who locks the whatever if I monk now just go and kill her kill whatever and so what what sacrifice what what can we do for the Lord just accountants with tons given with appreciation with worship we just forget about ourselves we lay everything just at the door there when we come in here I'm just getting the spirit and look at the profits or say it said in a in a transmission he said what's going about John see he wasn't the spirit on the last day now remember the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit so that is the battle the devil will no want to do that and remember remind you everything that's going on for the week and try to wear you down and the person is struggling physically suddenly that will be strong to get in the spirit and you manage to come to a level and they so struggling and the puzzle will come but we are not here to be for somebody to check us off we're here to actually pull down the prints of God amen all right so so I said now remind the first the first the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit house this revelation is going to ever come to you get in the spirit how how are you ever going to get the Holy Ghost and I believe and there's no question that the most important thing for everyone here good young and old for young people I want to just like menisci I'm looking for this afternoon I'm sure we don't have a wonderful time it's afternoon but it's a privilege that you have yet you are born you are in this church I don't mean this building I don't mean this physical building you are in under the blood they took the fullness of the word you may not you don't have to understand everything don't don't unless they don't have to answer everything just have to believe now and those those top of maybe your parents and message and have the body message that they're growing up don't just stop at that because God is not a grandparent it's a father okay so so you're not going to go in the ticket of your father amen so you got your own ticket but well don't ever be discouraged don't ever stop to listen to what the devil has to say but I bleep was do it testimony said that when they will open this lie is mouth he does what he lies and how would you deal I if it's not in line with the word simple and short amen so what am I trying to say you don't stop our truth ever stop until you get the Holy Ghost and if you have the Holy Ghost don't stop until I revealed because the dynamics of this church will be the Baptist the Holy Ghost which we are work in a measure so we needed dynamics to keep us going amen all right so so so it's a hard you ever going to get the Holy Ghost get in the spirit get in the spirit when you when you were sinner and you went to dance you got industrial all mine you started clapping them hands I'm patting your feet and she's digging and train your heart of the floor I am doing I run a run acting silly you was in the spirit of it just give us idea you know what it means you know that kind of thing could you imagine a fellow was they dance field going to a dance say well I'm you having her a pretty good time I suppose oh they say you wore flowered out of here go other can you say go at the ballgame somebody in rocking home run and some and something another set and look and somebody set on look and say well that's pretty pretty good yeah he won't be able baseball fan horror fan you know you wouldn't be real you wouldn't be in the spirit of baseball when somebody knocks in homerun you raise up and roll out who my win you knock somebody off this he said and and nobody nobody sees that ain't about about it why did I have a good shot in the spirit of the then you say oh no brother Isis isn't it it's in the field you know football field well Brom said then in the church when you get in the spirit reserve and horror movie hallelujah present Lord Holy Roller was over the wood I'm good as a question if we are holy rollers because we do that their names are on holy rollers out there I rather be a Holy Roller who taught you I'm reading that Anthony at that I'm a holy roller my certainly may be you know was trying to what about John in the other pod partners maybe he was dancing and jumping running around the island was having a good time it wasn't his spirit that may sound since our previous problem said but I don't mean it that way see he could that well he might be doing that I believe he was having a good time in the spirit just praising God because that's exactly what happened when this beautiful only only on them on this first place when the hooligans fell on them they staggered like drunken men and women and other led they were drunk jabbering and Cairo led out to the booze said this will are full of new wine that's the way they acted in the first time so the spirit come again he probably will act the same way see there's nothing new about this hallelujah so it's not a new present Lord hallelujah he said this is the old-time religion give me that old-time religion give me that old-time religion give me that old-time religion is true and now for me that would touch a world but give me Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh man you so well in itself it's it's on this earth what do you know I told you but in heaven guys shouting amen and also he hell there is noise it's not so Christ said there will be there will be weeping and gnashing their teeth not to be hell so so we are where will you choose to be because you just kept the noise right all right praise the Lord so we are in heavenly places amen in heavenly places we're having a good time with the Lord ma when when Andy hits a home run woof you see your victory you cannot see the cannot see get in when seated hallelujah oh my my my my mind and perhaps chances I'm sorry I diluted give him some time to this because I will not get to my message but that is fine if I can read that's fine also so Barbara was saying this it's it's any sooner its own experience it deep cut to the deep I remember on an instant standing there if you pardon me for leave my subject I'm a planning they're watching and seeing the rainbow and I wept you might say I got worked up emotionally maybe I did what I got crying I couldn't help it not because I was sad because I was happy here in the wolf Cola or his central that all led me to this to see the rainbow and I remember in the in the rainbow he gave a promise it was to look upon the Bible as just burn study stone at the end of both rainbows the Alpha and Omega how his promise is true Christ it never fail he had he had anchored me in his kingdom homina uncle today who the law ma not by my own works but by the grace he had called me superb and was going to this and sometimes happening by for knowledge he had elected yeah he brought me in and all that comes to me he will receive raise him up in the last day this promises and I got to weeping so he ran was in the spirit of what the Lord was doing amen and he got to being stimulated you know so I got to shouting don't know whether you believe it or not but I did I begin to run around and I rounded tree just as hard as I could that's a prophet amen my giving vent to my feelings Amen hallelujah now you can call it emotions but to me it was the deep call him buddy I was creamy to the top of my voice honest I believe it they have thought they had submission I mean out there if some of them would have had me but I was noble to hear me but the Lord he was the one I was blessing anyway and around the tree I went around around again and again and I guess if someone would have come they put me in a straitjacket you can't put me straight jacket man I don't know how done for me and they said to show for you as well Satan you cannot put no district decade I was a sinner I was a sinner but God is about me he set me free I will lay him they woke up and say I'm redeemed brother what money war riches what education what possession amen can we compare with that you know that anymore my did not cost you mobile said look we don't have any coastal fear the once said I've death does not change you one bit it only changes your list of our board from one place to the other and brother I want to leave very quickly Amen hallelujah to that land where that's no sorrow that's not going to work just to be a spin as that it made no pressure of finances to meet oh praise the Lord hallelujah that's no working I'm feeling terrible this morning no so nice to feel about Amen right so I guess so occasion I would say though I was what he thought I was crazy so I want to put a straitjacket but I was just screaming to the top of my voice and after a while it look okay so some experient interrupted him and so and so forth now now as we pass through this journey let us remember that our lap down creates we planned the day God knew the day you are conceived in a modest room with a we call you home is already arranged everything amen he will not tell you what's going to happen between them it is the matter doesn't matter up and down no troubles and one it doesn't matter it's only going to work his way to bring it to the end and so what they say what's what I'm saying things are too to be so your breath here was horribly plant creeping pre-planned so what do you worry about what we did was sleep about I guess you believe that every one of you knows that our birth here was pre-planned did you know that your being here never altered or related just as a myth or as a thought everything was all pre planned by God before the first of the world that you will be here so God knows that I am a family the song we call New Zealand about 20-something hours of flight away from home what am I doing here I don't know what I believe I mean the will of God and I'm happy that's one happy Lord let me be in your will my daily prayer Lord if you allow me to leave well maybe one more day may every meet of heat come for Jesus amen hallelujah okay so pre-plan did you know that you will be your being here okay so so going down the evil god node and to be infinite he had to know every flea that ever would be in the earth and how many times to eat to about his eye that's infinite see you our little minds cannot fathom what it means the infinite God he knew all things before there's nothing so therefore that of cater with the Lord and I don't believe that the person just happened to be here by chance I mean we have to get this not just think when you come to the world everything okay when you come to the world everything had for prepared for you prepare rather than for you I don't have to understand that how that we could think that God that a God that could prepare all these things for us would not or we could not put trust in him if he brought us in this chaos and we are in and prepare the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust him to repair the thing that is to come see if the know things now talking about the promised land amen because it tell you this morning my correspondence possessing your image inheritance in the promised land so God has already given you the promise and it's your inheritance what will get you step forward amen and sober brand was saying about about K about about Kanan and said what the natural de lecture the promise to Israel the natural and kena right but ours is spiritual promise amen and he says a Canaan does not present age of millennium it only represents the age of the overcomer amen the edge of hell disposition of overcoming because in Canaan they killed and bone and took cities and there will be no death in Bellino right and another thing it does it brings us justification by faith after they believed in Moses for me and they left Egypt so they believe are justified and they left Egypt and that was sonification to follow order the pillar of fire and I torment of a sacrificial lamb in witness and then enter into the land they have been promised now the camp will twist three stages come to this from its land now watch is family tap in the New Testament there was twisted using the journey and there's three stages in the journey for we are justified by faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ for second the land of Egypt will come out and then our son defied to the orphan of the blood washed from our saints and become pilgrims and surgeons claiming that we are all sick in a land a city that's coming or a promise all right so the Israel and in in wilderness sajin is no place of rest traveling night and day following the pure fire well finally country promised land where they settle down the Ark's where the believer comes he comes first to recognition that he is a sinner and the and then he is separated by the waters the washing of the water by the blood amen by Washington what by the world rather believing on the Lord Jesus Christ then being justified by faith it because petechiae and the peace with God true sirs Christ baptizing in love Jesus Christ - to permit him to enter the journey you get it into the journey then he he becomes a sojourner and a pilgrim he's he is on his journey - what a promise that God made okay so Israel had not yet received the promise birthday we only journey so please understand and he was right the Companions arena premiums and you know how how did they fell but Israel when they when they come to the sport of California when the spies went out and said the land is great but some of them came back and said we can take it because the cities are wardrobe and so forth but Joshua and Caleb stood and said we are more able to take amen so what the Word of God will simply say the promises a male that God given to you the devil is will come to the fractions of the flesh see smell taste feel that here to discourage you it will come true to the fashions of the Spirit conscience memory affection reasoning limit to discourage you but Caleb and usual look beyond amen and saw the promise amen while the others are giants so the open opposition Oprah's on a giant Caleb and Joshua saw them as grasshoppers and say if you love you be with us and have your question this one is a lot yet this morning well you said we're to India and we is something happens so I'd be smaller if you are hungry for the Holy Ghost you cap that we're coming to that you go we'll give it to you and I want to I want to toast many young people you get this when the Holy Ghost well you need it and I tell you why I was listen now listen to what abruptly post testimony I'm saying because he said it so it's in YouTube so is Naboo bomb but the poll was with his father who the campaign's and he gave it testing the we're we're robbing as a mission from from India for to a lab report to see the angel so he saw and he saw healings and no meat but he said that I had no Holy Ghost okay and when the time comes him the wind or try a came and they began to speak to you know you to listen you know you are missing so much out there this in Dhaka Hall name it smoking and and he went yes went drinking smoking and in school into gambling gambling this is so it happened that one place he went he was very well I see did you see the devil knows how to sew so actually progress it's not the evidence of God being with you right so she was it was pleased very well but the point that she I think he went to the next level and when the time came for that nest nest level they he went in went in and the owner of the place said boy this not for knows what place are you you live under that person with my gesture no no he's very good and are you not the son of Abraham he said no why because he couldn't get himself what he's doing the environment he was in to be associated with Barbra and wasn't long he took ill he took ill so bad I was going to die and the doctors said that he the only wood it was so bad I think interesting so the only chance he has is to so was 14 15 or so 16 it was for him to the harvest in test time and then and then put a roast on I didn't hook as I put the power so he be used to from the extreme young boy and before the they could get they were desperate to get the father to sign consent when I was still on the age and they couldn't contact over they called a call so because he left home actually due to ground to the grand mother there was the governor was there and then I think just the morning before the surgeon surgery the grandmother they took the sign and suddenly somebody touched his back elbow behind the belong was in the mountain and I just said who quickly your son needs you so they couldn't contact him inform what window so that's God's Messi who you and I I'm then and then it came he said daddy pray for me that I won't pray for you I know I didn't mean it that way you know so I said that you you you seen you love the angel you pray the Lord anyway it was an end and you know when you you have like a theme you know so the end is what they call the the good end so what happy ending correct yes so God pray for the Sun and it's as the doctor this could be given another test so no no no no in fact he doesn't have too much time to say okay no he said he waited he that he went out he went through from the Lord now has just returned would you please check him over again and they checked over not one single young people I tell you that's not now there so and don't worry don't be discouraged go has a time for you but you got to you got to want it God designed the Holy Ghost it would ask God to help you that's nowhere when we talk about inheritance don't worry about the big why just me you need the Holy Ghost because in the whole puzzle is all we have need of amen I feel I need him today then when I first started almost 40 years ago for the odd odd years ago when you Lord gave me a repeat mrs. to me so I said I need him as much why because when this flesh we have it's a battle daily battle and when they captain you know Joshua so much believed the word he wasn't discouraged cp1 look not at all all the cities and the woman of war on him to the to the point of one day the lost Amy came in present in person and just wasn't afraid withdrew his soul Tommy are you for or against us hallelujah oh my are you for us against on because I know what God said about me and know my side if this time before me Amen God give me the Holy Ghost and sit down you cannot stop me you cannot give him an battle don't take me I'm not qualified who is qualified that doesn't want me you know that Satan doesn't know whom you are you believe that when he made Christ he didn't know who he was he said if thou be so how do you believe him them he doesn't know who you are because you are told you how you have seniority oh but he devil before he was created you when ghost mine Amen that's the secret well that is no love story that God brought us was a male in this life to get us ready to remind us we are aware and so now God gave her the promise because what did what did devil does is the master of the pappases life mouth he lies can see you're not qualified who are you to get the Holy Ghost after you've been asking God listen for this number of years I've been asked for 40 years yet like calleb have you after 150 years yet like Noah praise the Lord so God is watching your heart amen and now if you make a mistake don't stay out a man just run back in why there is nothing out there but death must sorrow hey man and stand behind a word because Ram said that where where Eve made a mistake while she talked to list it if she has said to have thought 24/7 said no devil I don't care how you pin the world you just do not do this pillar don't eat there what would happen is shield the same to you and I there's a Lord okay wow wow I just said all right so we're able to take it are we so but believe us but the believers Caleb and Joshua are feet that was growing up to the promise they moved on over to the land and to the land and settle down the land as a possession and we never look at it and we never stop at justification the certification let us go let us go on - but back to the Holy Ghost let's not stop believing on the largest Christ being baptized of course you have to be baptized but don't stop there let not stopped I'm the message to agree the message was the message with it is God in you the word make made manifest living moving moments of living God a man living cabacas of living God was sent to achieve amen so let's go on says let's go on to the person of the Holy Ghost let's not stop I believe in Allah Jesus Christ he said but now we press on into a position to a promise of button Holy Ghost for Peter said on their Pentacles for the promise on to you and to your children and to them that afar off even as many as the Lord our daughter call Amy or glue it to god yes keep those my I'll happy this morning now okay this release is very important all right so listen so that we come to the house of God 12 for correction I mean so so God is God's love you know to you and I and now after you are in that don't mean that you are free from war right you still have to fight every inch of ground you stand on amen every promise we don't want to take your peace say no you can't take my piece because I have your promise that these are given to you but at the wall give it so the world put everything in the world money whatever however not as the world giveth the war did not give me the peace the work and not take it away amen if that piston from divine hymn in my soul it cannot do what cannot take it away so every promise when the Holy Ghost is your promise you gotta fight for it it's not that you're going to achieve it no it's already given to you but what you need to go take it what a pattern is not a pattern until received and if I promise you a gift I promise you a gift they gave display in there it wouldn't be your son to use the pattern the world take it and what did our daughter know see you have asked for too long for so long you think it's yours get the famine it's my promise and today I'm gonna get it Lord do you feel that way young people amen so why the what is going to be praying your heart they're gonna want it Lord and if you have feel cell I want to be repeat Lord hallelujah so we're gonna fight for every gang will stand on Kennon did not represent the great heaven goes a war and troubles and killings and fight and so forth but what we did to present this with the it must be a perfect work amen that's what the church is feeling today on the work do you know that even your behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed hallelujah so when we come here is your lord lemon ability hindrance remove this morning Lord touch my heart Lord prepare me Oh God hallelujah okay so you behavior to knock somebody else are getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of of you believers then cause it sure to bitterly fail and at that day of judgment you be responsive for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute blah blah well that's true think think of it Joshua after he crossed we went to the land God giving the promise don't think to find an entire campaign without losing a man without even getting his crutch without having to happiness of his aid or a band go see the land is yours go fight pink of fighting a campaign and there's no Red Cross around there's nobody getting hurt and then slid amorite and the hittite but there wasn't no one hurt among them onto the scene came to the camp and what a camp took the baby babbling comment and now gold wedge and he didn't tell his camp then the next day they lost system men as I said stop stop stop this wrong God there was a promise at the six equinox times seek a many cancer will be dissolved hallelujah there'll be a revival hallelujah the Holy Ghost are pouring stop stop what you mean there's something wrong we are going to call seven days of fast God made us a promise that nothing to hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet and as so and there's something wrong something went wrong somewhere consisting dead men lay India there is Allah brother brothers now talking about behavior in the church one was talking about efficient torture she said if you have some that you can't listen if you have something that we can't do in Jesus name let it alone somebody's sick said take it we drink so sure yeah just you can do that in Jesus name so let it alone somebody say play a little card UK you can't do that just name so let it alone he looked at his smokes mati joke at your bridge party you can we can't tell that in Jesus name so let alone you can't we're shots in this name so let alone I could go on you know what I'm talking about alright you can do that what what you can do in his name leave it alone amen because he said whatever you do in word and deed do it in the name of Jesus Christ Oh Ram said we are so shortbread me you love us only guilty who shot of what Christ wants us to be right here in this day it's time to lay aside every sin that that easy beset us and run with patience the rest I said before us preachers that's right Braden and said the only thing that matter get all these little differences away from you the two funny Phil in Samarra around you for bredrin things that - shake it away don't let no root of bitterness ever get to your soul if you do it will conquer you right hip love I don't care how much people I don't care how much we hate you you love them anyhow come on say Amen all mmm is so beat how oh my if you can't do that you ain't sealed you got loose please yet so come on back and get sealed off right good with the blood of just Christ if you cleanse you from all roots of bitterness mmm try to do something dude and just keep being good for no malice no grudges don't let any bitterness no matter how bad the person is and our buddy talked about you don't ever don't never think even in your heart against them what's right there the devil will set right in and woke up something there just keep it all covered with God a love confession I'm making right and do good to those who do evil to you if you only do good to those who do good to you why I just said don't the publicans the same see they seen us anybody can do good to those that do good to them but be be but be good to those who are not good to you do something for those that will not do nothing for you speak a good word but the man that will speak evil against you and that way you keep orbiting us out of your heart and always in love everybody then as long as you stay in love for the Lord why am on court now as heaven is prepared it's a it's a practice for people people God in His infinite mercy has sent the Prophet with a message to prepare us for a second coming I know glad hallelujah and he said somewhere that a prophet is a sign of judgment of the world right so so the same word I would join the words when I put that's listen you Amen in your place in the body so he said yeah so it says it took about here we say it's a profit place it's a private place calling in to perfection and you have to be perfect to get there MA now don't forget about about the warp effort here right okay the Bible said so just said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it is a perfect kingdom so it must be a pre people come because you have to stand and be married to the person of God and you must be a prophet bride so how can you do it to address both the private word amen that was why he had to send the prophet got all losing and fill difference of the word so and he said I've come to introduce reveal what amen and you have been privileged amen to to see it and you receive it and then that is the perfection in you that is why every other thing will fail amen so you can do it true you you can do it to anything else poor dependent world which is the waters of separation that washes us from sin from saying amen that's right think so the blood will just Christ think of it dripping blood the word yeah yeah so she stands perfect virgin on a daughter on audio treated she never seen in the first in first place this is how doth sees you amen so you is like how if you see the way and received word God sees you and spoke it it was the way that Caleb and Joshua saw the promise and spoke it but there was enough to cool him down made him formal and cold and indifferent and religious and church members but you just said no hallelujah go to God so he saw the promise and God as and that's your inheritance it's individual we got to go for it don't look at what is this furniture in maybe it's not yet a week or something so just press on amen those who listen to today's those whom he foreknew he designated those whom it be decided of a new who called those who record he had justified and those are justified and already purified but one said so which means head Amen hallelujah because he's already finish the work Amen this old world can never hold me any moment I will become all I have mine I mean my constant creation and I have my wedding coming on and forms the old orgrim meat from a ministry roll this right are you roped time to go home praise the Lord with the word wedding coming hallelujah oh thank you Jesus hallelujah we are just to stay on says dumb so quit being scared those who wonders driving this ship not you and I we are just to stay on be faithful be true in the old secret chamber where nobody else is you what is your desire Brandy was speaking about what gives you pleasure is that what is your default to do try to escape the edges of life and there was all you go to youtube you see no one from one team to the other to the other and to Instagram and to Facebook you know what anything today you are tired empty but if you if you hook him you find time who came good that's him that's the husband give us great secrets to you amen or wood and slow for you and what and his purpose and plan for you and you are hearing it but had to be passed a revelation for you hallelujah coz if it'll be two you're gonna have the Holy Ghost they don't care what the devil says even what you feel about it just believe oh my okay look what was once what was was God's great secret great mystery in the in his mind is now put in their hearts or the believer that is the body of Christ what was what was God's was great secret in his mind before the function of the world is now made manifest think of it that is a mystery of God revealed and but I said I'm sure you don't you don't don't get it I said well I can't see it the way I ought to say it but I'm sure it didn't but go help out this morning god bless mystery what eternal dot has as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ they're given right down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ right Jesus making love this church is bright whispering secrets to her him and then we start justifying his presence as a drop of ink dropped into a table full of bleach you will never find this thing of the ink no more that was it so what devil can accuse you when you generally confess it Amen is gone you stand profit without perfect and what Amazing Grace if you will never come back again and when the when the man is she redeemed does possess the CC that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished hallelujah has promised world's is gone separated is dropped into the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ it's never to be remembered God forgets it amen hallelujah oh my god forget it and he stands as his son and and he depends individual status on that of God in the face of God we must have amen amen now we now I will sons of God amen so now are we the sons of God wonderful oh my okay so position when he returns in the promised land Paul admonished us in Hebrews 6:1 say therefore leaving the principles of doctrinal of Christ let's go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God according as divine power since Peter chapter 2 had given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness image was toward another of him that have caught us agree on virtue whereby are given yeah we're by giving towards exceeding great and precious promises hallelujah that by these you might be particles of divine nature having escaped the corruption as in the world through lust amen so particular divine nature so what is the battle a man we came to this flesh this plant can never never obey God right okay and we have a human spirit with this first set of senses of spirit you know memory recently remember was my deed for you had it said that and how my garden conscious in all those things back to food okay but God has sent down his is passing the word that a vine nature knows right now so that comes into you as you open up as we receive it and so it will not overcome this and make a subject amen hallelujah so and and and somebody may wonder how do I do this anyway he helped get this bobbum said in deep go to the deep he said now listen close before that can be deep that can be a deep in here calling there had to be a deep here to respond to the call so if I'm a desire for God this morning he is telling you that it does it so to respond amen so you've got to have a desire you wouldn't want to have it want it to receive it amen and if you don't ask her I'd know how so please give me that desire give me give me give me her longing father I'm not happy - well ma'am I am blog absently promised a wanted personal to me hallelujah so say yeah in other words there was in other words before there was a theme on fish back there had to be water for him to swim or it never had seen before there was a tree to grow on earth they had to be the F and F was for the tree to grow in or they will not they have no trees to grow on F so what I mean for example just a show us go will not say tree go and go and bring forth fruit without the earth right in the same way how can the birds fly without wings right and how can the fish swim without Fame how can you be a Christian with their own egos now if God gave the tree the earth to grow and gave the fish the film to swim and get the birds the wing to fly would you give me the Holy Ghost hallelujah he is able abominable car to God so give it the Holy Ghost right now I'm not a believable tomorrow today hallelujah oh god is good hallelujah oh my and it was talking about how God gave instincts to the attitude and to the to the birds and to escape judgment destruction it quick amen and and just read it so quick you put some sweet how long ago and here no no not long ago when billion I entered into India I read a piece in the paper and he says something something happened it was just the day before the earthquake came and and India doesn't have wire fences like we have they have rock fences and before the earthquake came all the birds and all the next that had the nets in those fences and those great big buildings they flee account in the middle of the woods and all the cuts on the ship and stood out out in the Sun around the fences they all went out in the middle of the field is Sun and still still God had give them an instant to let them to let them know beforehand to get away from this was just like he didn't deserve no and if they buy instant who tell destruction was at hand how much more or the church to do with the boxes of Holy Ghost amen how much more and it's again in the guide if God could give a dog in no sense to know how to dirty corners how he to give us to give the church listening if the dog can do that by instinct what about the Holy Ghost in the church it ought to lead us from formalities and tweets and things into the glorious wonderful Babson Holy Ghost it brings virtue knowledge temperance godliness only goes that's what the real guy will do MA so he's telling us here that he's here or it's all he's here amen to give you what will make you to live a victorious Christian to make you make this what the Word of God present tense not historian not history amen we see him manifest interpretation because he's interpretive his word and to interpret means to bring it to pass hallelujah in your life as individual amen so to what is it doing is trying to to bring us that statute man amen and Peter saying here how that how how almost be partakers of divine his divine nature now each one of us are trying to grow to the Statue of God I mean that is that is the dhih dhih dhih dhih once you do you believe the world are just five seven five the Holy Spirit said with the birth comes the faith and then you start to grow a mattress oops oops downs you increase it you you are growing you you are decreasing he's increasing hallelujah okay so and that's what I'm trying here this morning to Bob I'm coachable bahama to teach the little church and myself how we can become the dwelling place of God how many like to be that the dwelling place our living God now here's what we do was the first scene have faith and be born again that's laying foundation and after we laid foundation secondly you got your foundation out of your faith they at your fate then you add virtue to your faith this is the next column best pour pour on your foundation faith they add fate adventure Peter says seven things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience goodness Bala kindness and then love the Holy Ghost rise in the pressing of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true box of the Holy Ghost and you got to the virtues in you then gold lives in a tabernacle or the building delivering chemical living goes to an in place I mean now that's the house that God was in not a building with a big bed on top of it and the highest steeple see but a body has a prepared meaning a boiled egg or can julienne and working go can see in rock and talking talking working amen Brahma said that God has no the eyes but your eyes no other mouth watch your mouth with the lord hallelujah my for for we are written epistles read of all men and if the life that's in Christ being Jew you will be the life that Christ I'm coming too close only now we with now we put I wanted to follow me now now we put the blood of just Christ in see that brings faith of just Christ virtue of just Christ no job just Christ temperance obvious Christ so it's not your knowledge that you're the one citizen will have this measure of virtues but that's not it who exactly him in you and I bringing for this amen so that's where it be very important that the Holy Ghost had especially in your life in my life amen to produce build with us up amen so patience and goodness of just try to polit kindness Christ and the love of God which is just Christ he is the head that controls and your feet is foundation a main control by head there is the Prophet man of God when he possesses these virtues but each each age God has placed these things into this church and patent it by showing that each individual has this possess the qualities Amen now says lots of money lots of big things lots of popularity this is our debt to the
