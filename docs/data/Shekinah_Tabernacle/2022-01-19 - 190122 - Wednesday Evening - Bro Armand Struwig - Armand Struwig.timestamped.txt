[39:37] it's good to tap him and say hey watch
[39:38] out

[39:41] brother comes back to you or the younger
[39:42] one and taps you and say hey watch out
[39:45] so that's what we're here for please
[39:47] don't look at me because you'll miss it
[39:48] all look at him amen i'm sitting right
[39:51] there before sister margie tonight i'm
[39:52] preaching to myself because this was

[40:13] uh just before we really go to thank you
[40:15] musicians you're awesome god bless you
[40:18] thank you musicians
[40:21] i went to fielding and um i want to just
[40:23] give a little bit of testimony with five
[40:24] seconds
[40:26] we got to to fielding and we fellowship
[40:27] with brother alpha and their men and uh
[40:30] sometimes you wonder why am i walking
[40:33] where i'm going why brother ed can you
[40:35] turn this fault back off or just mute
[40:37] the fallbacks please
[40:38] i don't like hearing my own voice
[40:42] i sound so afrikaans
[40:44] [Laughter]
[40:46] so we go to fielding and then you know
[40:48] fielding they just they just love god
[40:50] and they just happy and they're such a
[40:52] it's a close family and we visit with
[40:54] brother alfond we choose some fat with
[40:56] him and all those things that brother
[40:57] moses comes and says hello
[40:59] and um we just we just fellowship around
[41:02] the world and everything that ben
[41:03] preaches
[41:04] came over the pulpit
[41:06] and everything that the pastor's
[41:07] preaching in in taranaki came over the
[41:10] pulpit auckland's preaching
[41:12] you know came over the pulpit
[41:14] we had um brother tezia that came over
[41:17] the pulpit see god is so good so now we
[41:21] go to church
[41:23] and we show up to church and brother
[41:25] canaan is sick he can't go to church so
[41:27] they don't have someone for the sound
[41:29] because brother alpha has to do the song
[41:30] leading
[41:31] so i thought i was going to go there to
[41:33] relax but they put me on the sound
[41:35] so who do i behold coming in the door
[41:38] brother phil
[41:39] and guess what asiv was sick they needed
[41:42] a bass player so brother fall slotted
[41:44] right in and the service continued and
[41:46] the sister pecked out the cheese
[41:48] for people and brother alpha said to i
[41:50] think was brother alfred moses said why
[41:52] do you put so many cheese in she goes oh
[41:53] well this is for the angels of the lord
[41:55] they're going to come and sit here
[41:57] but guess what they're all filled up
[41:59] and people came and and god knew
[42:03] before that day he knew that that was
[42:06] going to happen and he knew canaan was
[42:07] going to be sick brother cain and he
[42:08] knew alpha was going to be sick so he
[42:10] already prepared that not like us
[42:12] knowing but just walking
[42:14] and just following the leading of the
[42:16] lord placed you somewhere to help so
[42:18] that they can further the kingdom of god
[42:21] that's the god we serve
[42:22] and if you really think it's not a
[42:24] miracle if you think logistics and
[42:26] brother cabinets and logistics it
[42:28] doesn't happen that good
[42:32] brother come in there's always scope so
[42:34] so tonight please enter in and and you
[42:37] are predestinated to be here tonight god
[42:39] has a visitation for you tonight and if
[42:42] you can really receive what's coming
[42:43] over this pulpit you will walk out of
[42:45] here victorious amen
[42:49] okay so 120 it says david says here this
[42:52] is a song of degrees that's what it's
[42:54] titled in the bible
[42:56] and when i looked at the word degrees
[42:57] because you know my english is pretty
[42:59] all over the show um that word before i
[43:02] read it it says that it's a amount a
[43:05] level to the extent which something
[43:07] happens or is present
[43:10] so so david's writing this psalm and
[43:12] basically how i understand it is this is
[43:15] a very present situation he's in
[43:18] and so he's declaring to who's ever
[43:20] writing the song while he's saying it
[43:21] that hey i'm currently in this
[43:25] so state
[43:25] want you to note this down
[43:28] and this is what he notes down verse one
[43:29] he says in my distress i cried unto the
[43:32] lord and he heard me
[43:34] and he heard me he delivered my soul oh
[43:37] lord from lying lips and from a
[43:39] deceitful tongue
[43:41] so david had a deliverance he had a
[43:44] problem he was struggling and he says i
[43:46] just want to tell you a prison truth
[43:48] what's happening now god has just
[43:49] delivered me from that
[43:51] okay from lying lips in a deceitful
[43:53] tongue what shall be giving unto thee or
[43:56] what shall be done unto thee thou false
[43:58] tongue
[43:59] so he knows already the biggest fight he
[44:01] has is with
[44:03] there we go amen
[44:06] sharp arrows of might
[44:08] oh it's mighty man and the cause of
[44:10] juniper
[44:12] woe is me for our sojun and misik
[44:15] i think it's how you say it and that i
[44:16] dwell in the teens of gadar my soul have
[44:19] long
[44:20] dwell with him that have peace
[44:23] i am for peace but when i speak
[44:26] they are for war
[44:28] amen um you can have your seed saints
[44:32] may the lord list this word and um i am
[44:35] not it's not a
[44:36] it's not a scolding service
[44:39] it is actually encouragement so so the
[44:42] reason i read the scripture
[44:44] is sometimes our tongue says one thing
[44:46] and our body sees another thing and our
[44:49] brains is another thing but that's not
[44:50] what god's saying
[44:52] so we must be really we must be really
[44:54] in tune with god when we do anything
[44:57] and we must be so sure that when we
[44:59] speak that it's not just us speaking but
[45:03] it is actually god speaking and it's
[45:05] hard because once you speak and i'm not
[45:08] going to get ahead of my but once you
[45:09] speak something and you release that
[45:11] word
[45:12] something's going to happen it will not
[45:14] come to you void
[45:15] something's going to happen because you
[45:17] set something in motion and that's why
[45:19] prophets had to speak the word of god
[45:21] and that's why the bible had to be
[45:23] preached because there was a word that
[45:25] had to go forth
[45:26] so as long as you remember that concept
[45:28] tonight children whatever you do do not
[45:32] get distracted this is for you as well
[45:36] so if you find yourself dozing off i
[45:38] encourage you to come back i will not
[45:40] like brother moses call you out her
[45:42] brother um
[45:44] i call him brother samson i won't let
[45:46] call you out um
[45:48] but i will definitely maybe pause for a
[45:50] sec and get your attention
[45:54] and my mouth is so dry praise the lord
[45:56] okay
[45:57] so my title for tonight if you can put
[45:59] it on
[46:00] and i want you to look at this title it
[46:02] says who
[46:04] am
[46:05] who i am
[46:06] so so who
[46:09] and the i am right
[46:12] so remember god in the book of genesis
[46:14] says i am the i am
[46:16] so who
[46:17] i am
[46:18] because once you understand this you can
[46:20] understand how god works in his people
[46:22] and what god does for us every day
[46:25] so who
[46:27] i am so we're going to go and turn to a
[46:29] little but there's a little bit of story
[46:30] and and i'm just going to paraphrase
[46:32] this and it comes out of the 6301 23 the
[46:35] prophet of god speaks about
[46:37] identification
[46:38] and he's talking about identifying you
[46:40] in the scriptures and he sees this he
[46:43] says it reminds me of a story of a
[46:45] little boy and he was and i'm going to
[46:47] paraphrase and he was brought up just a
[46:49] little boy out in the countryside
[46:51] somewhere pretty much like brother
[46:52] branham you know where they didn't have
[46:54] a mirror and they weren't used to all
[46:56] these fancy stuff
[46:57] he says and one day this little boy went
[47:00] to visit his grandma and he gets to his
[47:03] grandma and he walks into the house and
[47:04] the cupboard door's closed and behind
[47:06] the cupboard door's a mirror and as he
[47:08] walks into the house and he goes on
[47:09] about it and he says the boy looks back
[47:11] in the cupboard mirror is open and he
[47:13] sees another little boy
[47:15] and because he he's not used to a mirror
[47:18] he waves at the boy and the boy waves
[47:20] back and he goes man this is cool and he
[47:22] walks closer to the boy and the boy
[47:24] walks closer to him so then he walks
[47:26] right up to the mirror and he looks at
[47:28] the boy very hard
[47:29] and he goes mama mama it's me
[47:33] so i encourage you he goes on to say
[47:35] this and this is what i want today
[47:37] tonight do not do not shovel anything to
[47:40] no one i want you to go find yourself he
[47:42] says here in in number 39 he says here
[47:45] and that is what we want to look at
[47:47] tonight i want you to look at me and i
[47:50] want to look at me and i want you to
[47:52] look at yourself
[47:54] and as we look into the great mirror of
[47:56] god's word let us be able to identify
[47:58] ourselves
[47:59] with someone
[48:01] that is going to speak about something
[48:04] and something of the characters of the
[48:06] other times
[48:07] and i want to see myself
[48:10] in god's looking glass because
[48:13] if i if anything will show me where i am
[48:16] standing in this book
[48:19] there is no book like this
[48:21] because this is all the truth he says
[48:23] it says and i know this one is true
[48:25] and it's the truth because it's the word
[48:27] of god now jesus gave us the example of
[48:30] what we ought to be looking at
[48:33] and he reflected his life through this
[48:35] word that we should see and we should
[48:38] look into god's mirror we should see
[48:40] ourselves identified with him
[48:43] that is a perfect example
[48:46] so before we go any further with the
[48:48] service
[48:49] i encourage you
[48:51] don't look at anything else
[48:54] but what we're telling you tonight in
[48:56] the word
[48:57] find yourself tonight in this great
[48:59] commission that we're talking about i'm
[49:01] gonna talk about joshua and and i had
[49:03] such a jubilee and we can stay in this
[49:05] book forever seriously it's such a good
[49:07] book because it we under that joshua
[49:10] commission
[49:11] and i'm gonna try my best to follow my
[49:13] notes because if i jump ahead i'm going
[49:15] to maybe forget something so please bear
[49:17] with me if i pause because i want to
[49:18] deliver it as the lord gave it to me
[49:21] and then after that whatever god does
[49:23] that is up to him
[49:27] so if we look at joshua the first
[49:29] chapter
[49:30] and we start there from
[49:32] verse 1 and he says and i'll just read
[49:34] it for you you can follow me along we're
[49:36] going to stay in that book tonight
[49:38] so now after the death of moses the
[49:40] servant of the lord it came to pass that
[49:42] the lord spake unto
[49:44] joshua the son of nun moses minister
[49:46] saying moses my servant is dead now
[49:49] therefore arise and go over the jordan
[49:51] thou and all the people
[49:54] into the land which i do give unto you
[49:56] even to the children of israel every
[49:59] place
[50:00] that the soul of your food shall tread
[50:02] upon i have
[50:05] i have
[50:07] given unto you
[50:09] and i said to moses and
[50:11] i said unto moses
[50:13] for the wilderness
[50:15] and this lebanon even unto the great
[50:17] river the river euphrates all the land
[50:20] of the hittites and unto the great sea
[50:22] toward the going down of the sun
[50:24] shall be your coast
[50:27] there shall not any man be able to stand
[50:29] before thee all the days of thy life
[50:32] as i was with moses so will i be with
[50:35] thee i will not fail thee nor forsake
[50:38] thee
[50:39] amen
[50:42] so now i'm going to just step away from
[50:43] it and say okay believing
[50:46] is for believers
[50:48] god's promises is for believers
[50:51] no one else
[50:52] okay the promises is for everyone but
[50:55] only the ones that grab it is believers
[50:58] so i want to encourage you if god says
[51:00] something you have to take that and
[51:02] believe it because before joshua before
[51:05] god spoke to joshua here
[51:07] moses sent the spies out
[51:10] and they came back with a report of
[51:12] believing they could do it now i don't
[51:14] want to go through the whole book and
[51:16] god saw that and he said i can work with
[51:18] that man
[51:20] because i want my plan of redemption to
[51:22] roll out but i need someone to do it
[51:25] and joshua was the one to say i can do
[51:27] it
[51:28] so he said the words the report he gave
[51:31] back to moses was we are more than able
[51:35] so his words is saying what god's heart
[51:38] is longing
[51:39] hence why our words care are you guys
[51:43] our words
[51:44] is speaking what god is longing
[51:46] so a prayer meeting is not just a prayer
[51:48] meeting it is god's heart expressed
[51:51] through a man put into words so it can
[51:54] go grab a promise and bring it to pass
[51:57] that's the word of god
[52:00] so that's his action plan now see when
[52:02] god spoke to joshua right there
[52:05] they were not in the promised land yet
[52:07] they haven't crossed the river jordan so
[52:09] they haven't gone over yet so joshua has
[52:11] gotten this promise from the lord he
[52:12] grabbed onto the promise and he says to
[52:14] the spies hey
[52:16] i'm going to send two spies go check out
[52:17] the land
[52:19] go make sure when you look at the land
[52:21] you go all the way also to jericho just
[52:23] go cover that and i'm just paraphrasing
[52:25] because i don't want to to read too much
[52:28] he says but i want to say this
[52:30] and this is romans 8 that the
[52:31] righteousness of the law may be
[52:34] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[52:36] flesh but after the spirit for they that
[52:38] walk after the flesh do mind the things
[52:40] of the fleece but they that walk after
[52:42] the spirit the things of the spirit for
[52:44] to be kindly minded as death but to
[52:46] spiritually mind it is life and peace
[52:49] now joshua and caleb didn't have life
[52:52] and peace
[52:54] they are death and war in front of them
[52:56] if you really think about it you say
[52:58] life and peace let's go peace so nothing
[53:00] happens to me
[53:02] nothing's going to happen to me i'm just
[53:03] going to cruise through it all and it's
[53:05] just going to be life and peace wherever
[53:06] i go
[53:08] you have life and peace because you know
[53:10] where you stand but it doesn't mean at
[53:13] that very situation that you're in a
[53:14] loving and a peaceful situation
[53:17] bear that in mind because your enemy he
[53:20] thinks because he gets you to be a bit
[53:22] frustrated he's got one on you you still
[53:24] have peace
[53:26] you still have life for the i am
[53:29] is in you
[53:31] amen
[53:33] so we go on and i'm going to tell the
[53:35] story of of joshua and i'm just going to
[53:37] do it my way so please bear in mind
[53:40] so
[53:41] it ties in the way how how joshua fought
[53:43] his campaign
[53:45] because because he didn't see anything
[53:48] carnally
[53:49] he was just walking on the promises of
[53:51] god
[53:52] it was jay and i mean for him he didn't
[53:54] see the challenges he just saw let's
[53:57] walk on god made a promise god can keep
[53:59] his promise because he knew the i am was
[54:01] with him
[54:02] okay because now remember god made him a
[54:04] promise so god is if god makes a promise
[54:07] he will not break his word he cannot
[54:09] break his word
[54:11] so now the second chapter verse one and
[54:14] joshua the son of nun sent out to shed
[54:16] him two men to spy
[54:19] secretly
[54:21] because or else they're not spies okay
[54:24] you know they don't come into jericho
[54:25] going hey boys
[54:27] god said we're going to take over this
[54:28] place no they sneak in okay
[54:31] but now where do they go where do these
[54:33] guys go
[54:34] they go and they view all the land of
[54:36] jericho and they went and came into a
[54:39] harlot's house
[54:41] a lady that is unclean because the only
[54:44] people that can receive them is a sinner
[54:48] because they came with a
[54:50] message
[54:52] i hope you catch it
[54:54] they are under a prophet ministry but
[54:57] they came with a message
[55:00] and that message was the mercy of god
[55:03] revealed for rahab's time because there
[55:06] was a little harlot
[55:08] called rahab
[55:10] and she lodged there
[55:12] and she saw what was busy happening
[55:15] around her she didn't understand because
[55:18] nobody before that part of the sea and
[55:21] walked through it
[55:22] you know and with the kings of og and
[55:25] all those guys before they were utterly
[55:26] destroyed so she knew
[55:28] something was coming away that's greater
[55:31] that what she had at that moment
[55:34] because she realized something and i
[55:36] don't want to jump ahead
[55:38] and then the king of jericho he goes and
[55:41] he goes and looks for those spies
[55:43] and because she's got a little bit of
[55:44] hope and she's got something she takes
[55:46] that messengers and she hides them
[55:49] because she knows that there is life in
[55:51] this message that just came away she
[55:53] knows that before there was only death
[55:55] because everybody just judged her
[55:57] everybody just saw her as a harlot she
[55:59] had a name she had a pass she had all
[56:01] those things but these messengers didn't
[56:03] care about those things they just come
[56:05] to say hey we're spying out the land
[56:07] there's a great army coming and you
[56:08] either for us or against us
[56:11] so that's the message the same message
[56:14] of the hour now
[56:15] there's a rapture coming you're either
[56:16] going or you're staying
[56:18] it doesn't change
[56:20] if you want it receive it
[56:22] if you want to go into a rapture you
[56:24] receive it because remember the message
[56:26] is still preached by the messengers
[56:28] brother ben he's a messenger
[56:31] okay he gives a message he's still under
[56:33] the pro the prophet okay he's still
[56:35] under the ministry of a prophet which
[56:37] god opened the word but he's just
[56:39] standing here and he's giving you a
[56:40] message and if you can receive that you
[56:42] got life
[56:44] if you can receive that you got life
[56:47] amen
[56:48] don't want to go over it but now
[56:51] realize that these spies
[56:54] now gives ray up that mission okay so
[56:56] and she hides them now she wants
[56:59] something back
[57:01] you know she wants something back
[57:03] because we don't we don't serve god just
[57:05] because
[57:06] we're christians
[57:08] i want something back i want rapture i
[57:10] want i want peace i want love i want
[57:13] patience meekness gentleness kindness
[57:14] long suffering i want overcoming power i
[57:17] want to be the full manifestations of
[57:19] the sons of god on this earth i have a
[57:21] purpose
[57:22] god has given it to me
[57:24] and he says it's yours you just have to
[57:26] show up
[57:28] that's what i want
[57:30] you know i i'm gonna sidetrack you i'll
[57:32] come back to that
[57:34] i might just say it i went for an
[57:35] interview today and i was sitting in the
[57:37] interview and it's and it's in our
[57:39] company
[57:40] and they say what do you want to be
[57:44] it's a loaded question okay
[57:49] [Laughter]
[57:51] i said in what context
[57:54] they go oh no in this company i said ah
[57:56] okay well let's just put a d
[57:58] but when he said it
[58:00] something he said to me is i wanna be
[58:03] he's
[58:04] i wanna be that one that stands in the
[58:07] devil's way every day and go you don't
[58:09] go further i want to be that testifies
[58:11] of god's goodness i want to see miracles
[58:15] i want to see people heal i want to see
[58:17] people raised up from the dead i want to
[58:19] see cancer be defeated i want to be that
[58:22] guy
[58:23] because he made me a believer
[58:26] and i was sitting there and i thought
[58:27] really in the greatest scheme of things
[58:29] what do i want to be
[58:31] i don't want to be here
[58:34] i so don't want to be here you know
[58:36] but we sometimes have to hold back
[58:38] because you must be ready to win the
[58:39] fire or we're not the fire okay
[58:41] but man what a loaded question he almost
[58:44] had me there
[58:45] i was about to close
[58:49] but man what a question
[58:51] that's not my new favorite question
[58:53] what do you want to be
[58:56] so now joshua 2 and we go to verse 12.
[59:00] now she identifies
[59:02] she identifies there's something and she
[59:04] goes and she says now therefore i pray
[59:06] you
[59:07] she's speaking to the spires now
[59:08] remember
[59:09] rahab is not talking to god here
[59:13] okay she's talking to two human beings
[59:17] okay she's talking to people that showed
[59:20] up on a door knocked and said hey please
[59:22] either the king wants to kill us okay
[59:23] she's not talking to god here she's
[59:25] talking to people
[59:27] and i'm telling you again she's talking
[59:30] to people so see the importance of what
[59:33] comes out of our lips
[59:35] it brings death or life i'm not going to
[59:37] jump ahead
[59:39] and she says
[59:41] since i have showed you kindness that
[59:43] you will also show kindness unto my
[59:45] father's house and give me a
[59:48] a true token
[59:50] and that you would save a life my father
[59:52] and my mother and my brethren and my
[59:54] sisters and all
[59:57] that they have
[59:59] and deliver our lives from death
[1:00:02] so she makes this petition
[1:00:05] to a person
[1:00:06] has no power
[1:00:08] no jurisdiction
[1:00:10] he's a human which words fell upon his
[1:00:12] ear
[1:00:13] but see because they she did something
[1:00:16] it was inside of them something said
[1:00:19] [Music]
[1:00:20] i hear that
[1:00:22] i hear that okay
[1:00:24] we go on
[1:00:26] and they the children of gr god and the
[1:00:28] and the bride of christ that's what we
[1:00:30] are now i'm asking you how many times us
[1:00:32] as brothers and sisters
[1:00:35] moms and dads
[1:00:37] asked for something from god
[1:00:41] and think he didn't hear
[1:00:43] or was busy talking to a brother and
[1:00:45] sister and pouring your heart out and
[1:00:46] crying your eyes out
[1:00:48] and think he didn't hear
[1:00:51] who says that
[1:00:53] who told you god didn't listen it's a
[1:00:56] lie
[1:00:58] doesn't mean it happens in another
[1:01:00] season or in another time of your life
[1:01:01] that god ain't listening he's listening
[1:01:04] amen he's mindful
[1:01:06] okay so be careful when you speak
[1:01:09] and then very five minutes after that
[1:01:11] proclaim the opposite of what you just
[1:01:13] asked for
[1:01:16] because what you see is what i asked the
[1:01:18] spies doesn't matter
[1:01:21] rayab didn't go with that attitude she
[1:01:23] was a believer and she knew the only
[1:01:25] thing she could do the only way to reach
[1:01:28] god right now is to speak to these
[1:01:30] people which is in my house talking
[1:01:32] about him
[1:01:34] the only way out
[1:01:36] so don't think you can't speak to a
[1:01:37] brother or sister don't think you can't
[1:01:39] come up here and and talk to the pastor
[1:01:41] and god doesn't hear that you don't need
[1:01:44] a aw moment for god to be on the scene
[1:01:46] you need two
[1:01:48] he says for two or more gathered in my
[1:01:50] name there i am and you don't even need
[1:01:53] to because if you go into your prayer
[1:01:54] closet he is there
[1:01:58] so don't ever doubt that he does not
[1:02:01] hear you
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:05] so remember these spies they were under
[1:02:08] a promise
[1:02:09] okay so god speaks to joshua the prophet
[1:02:13] brother branham brother branham goes to
[1:02:15] the messengers and say hey this is how
[1:02:17] god wants it go seek out the land they
[1:02:19] just show up with that message and they
[1:02:22] just preach that message and she speaks
[1:02:24] to those people which comes back to
[1:02:26] joshua now and they give the account
[1:02:28] back to joshua not god
[1:02:31] to joshua and they say hey while we were
[1:02:33] in the land there was a harlot called
[1:02:35] rahab that hit us but
[1:02:38] she asked something
[1:02:40] she asked for a family
[1:02:43] and they give the account back to him
[1:02:45] now again i'm coming back was this where
[1:02:47] people get brother branham and god mixed
[1:02:50] up
[1:02:50] brother branham was a prophet
[1:02:52] of this hour and he preached a message
[1:02:55] and god used him and whatever brother
[1:02:57] branham did god used him for it don't
[1:03:00] look at the veil because if it stopped
[1:03:02] at joshua
[1:03:04] then raya would have been dead
[1:03:06] it must go to god you must meet god not
[1:03:09] our prophet you must meet god the
[1:03:11] ministry introduces him the minister is
[1:03:14] talking about his peace his promises
[1:03:16] he's telling you how to overcome he
[1:03:17] gives you all the things you need to
[1:03:19] walk in this walk
[1:03:21] but that don't mean he's god that just
[1:03:23] means god used him you need to meet
[1:03:25] jesus christ our savior
[1:03:27] and that's the one that should be
[1:03:29] personal and if you can feed as much as
[1:03:32] you can of the word of god because
[1:03:33] brother branham said this is your
[1:03:35] identity
[1:03:37] and i listen to brother branham and all
[1:03:39] i hear is he's pointing me back to this
[1:03:40] word and said don't worry there's more
[1:03:43] because other preachers when i'm really
[1:03:45] segwaying now other preachers when i was
[1:03:47] out in the world never told me about sin
[1:03:51] they dance around sin you could sin as
[1:03:53] much as you like just go back to god and
[1:03:55] say i'm sorry and you're right it's a
[1:03:56] lie unconfessed sin will take you to
[1:03:59] hell
[1:04:01] because what unconfessed sin does it
[1:04:03] gives you a card and satan says you know
[1:04:05] what there you've done this deed take
[1:04:07] that okay
[1:04:09] thank you
[1:04:10] do you want that so because if he gives
[1:04:12] it to you and you get to the white
[1:04:14] throne judgment he pulls that out of
[1:04:16] your pocket and he goes ah you did this
[1:04:19] because he's got something held against
[1:04:21] you now
[1:04:22] because you didn't bring it to the open
[1:04:24] and it wasn't thrown under the blood he
[1:04:26] can attribute to it to if there's any
[1:04:28] unconfession in your life get rid of it
[1:04:31] it's not worth no matter how he lies to
[1:04:34] you to take that with you because all
[1:04:36] he's going to do is going to take it out
[1:04:38] of your pocket and it's going to give it
[1:04:40] right back at you
[1:04:41] because he's the accuser of the brethren
[1:04:44] and you know what he's really good at it
[1:04:47] because all he has is lies in the seat
[1:04:50] and if you hold on to lies and deceit he
[1:04:53] will use it in your life
[1:04:55] that wasn't part of the service so
[1:04:57] that's for someone
[1:05:03] so under a promise
[1:05:05] was made to joshua now these spies if we
[1:05:08] go there to
[1:05:15] here if we go to verse 18 it says behold
[1:05:18] when you come into the land
[1:05:21] thou shall bind this line of scarlet
[1:05:23] threat onto the window so now these
[1:05:25] these
[1:05:26] these messengers
[1:05:28] and and we're going to read that this
[1:05:30] mission just actually tells back
[1:05:32] while joshua's still on the other side
[1:05:33] of the promised land
[1:05:35] he's not indeed in the other side of
[1:05:36] jordan
[1:05:38] they only in the promised land they busy
[1:05:39] telling ray up hey
[1:05:41] look at this
[1:05:42] when we come and they bind the scarlet
[1:05:44] line the street in the window which thou
[1:05:46] didst
[1:05:47] lead us down by and thou shalt bring thy
[1:05:50] father and thy mother and thy brethren
[1:05:52] all the father's house unto thee he says
[1:05:54] and it shall be
[1:05:56] and it shall be
[1:05:58] what that whosoever shall go out of your
[1:06:01] doors of the of thy house into the
[1:06:03] street his blood shall be upon his head
[1:06:07] and we will be guiltless
[1:06:09] so what this is big words
[1:06:11] you know they don't know how the battle
[1:06:13] is going to go they two people in a
[1:06:15] massive battle they two people
[1:06:18] in the whole army of of joshua
[1:06:21] if you really think about it that's
[1:06:23] coming to a harlot's house and giving
[1:06:26] them a promise
[1:06:27] so who's your preacher standing you're
[1:06:29] telling you about the promise of god if
[1:06:31] there's so many other preachers out
[1:06:32] there what makes him right
[1:06:35] god is busy using him
[1:06:37] god is busy speaking because the reason
[1:06:39] we're all in this church is because god
[1:06:41] uses whoever's in this pulpit speaking
[1:06:44] that message to talk to us
[1:06:46] that's why we're not in all the churches
[1:06:48] we follow a pastor and god bless our
[1:06:50] pastor because sometimes the word comes
[1:06:52] over the pope and it's so
[1:06:54] it hurts so much
[1:06:56] but it heals
[1:06:58] because if you could take that word back
[1:06:59] to god you are under a promise
[1:07:02] because no way do i know that anybody
[1:07:05] would stand here and speak anything
[1:07:07] contrary to what god gives them amen
[1:07:09] because they will be held accountable
[1:07:10] for that
[1:07:12] remember why there is preaching it's for
[1:07:15] our benefit amen
[1:07:17] that's why you tell your kids of the
[1:07:18] whole time i do it a lot sorry reuben
[1:07:22] he says for their house his blood shall
[1:07:25] be upon
[1:07:26] upon his head he says
[1:07:28] and we will be guiltless and whosoever
[1:07:30] shall be with thee
[1:07:32] in thy house his blood shall be on our
[1:07:36] head if any hand be upon him
[1:07:39] now remember again i'm going to say they
[1:07:42] said this when they were still on this
[1:07:44] side of the jordan because what it says
[1:07:46] after that is they went and crossed the
[1:07:48] river jordan again and they went to
[1:07:50] joshua and they spoke to joshua and they
[1:07:52] gave them an account so please
[1:07:54] kids raise your hands all the kids
[1:07:59] all the children raise your hands come
[1:08:01] on malakai i know you can there we go
[1:08:03] okay and put them down
[1:08:05] i'm talking to you it's not something
[1:08:07] that's above you this is a great wall
[1:08:08] man
[1:08:09] this is this is something that that this
[1:08:11] world doesn't understand there was a war
[1:08:13] fought with the spoken word
[1:08:16] yeah oh man i just can't understand it
[1:08:19] sometimes
[1:08:20] okay we'll get there it was a shout by
[1:08:23] the way a great show so joshua chapter 5
[1:08:27] and verse 1.
[1:08:28] so now now the faith is going to be put
[1:08:31] into action because god now said be very
[1:08:34] courageous and let's cross the water um
[1:08:36] and and i'll get to that no i think i
[1:08:37] skipped that note let me just double
[1:08:39] check quickly
[1:08:40] so i don't want to skip that
[1:08:44] man technology the reason i don't like a
[1:08:47] phone
[1:08:51] everybody's still here saying me
[1:08:54] who loves the lord
[1:08:56] amen
[1:08:57] so we've got ray up accepting a promise
[1:09:00] and uh
[1:09:02] here we go okay i'm back on track
[1:09:04] okay we had pastor ben in there as well
[1:09:06] and under prophet's message and the
[1:09:08] messenger's response
[1:09:10] and now
[1:09:12] all things are possible to them that
[1:09:14] believe now here we go
[1:09:16] and now look chap go to that first verse
[1:09:19] now joshua
[1:09:21] goes through the the
[1:09:23] jordan
[1:09:24] now god had to show joshua that he was
[1:09:27] with him as he was with moses because he
[1:09:30] said to him in the first chapter as i
[1:09:32] was with moses so shall i be with
[1:09:34] okay so god had to do something for
[1:09:36] joshua so the people around him could
[1:09:39] see that i was with you
[1:09:41] so now joshua starts walking and he
[1:09:43] commands the priest he says go into the
[1:09:44] river jordan
[1:09:46] and what does he do he parts the waters
[1:09:50] so now all those people look and say wow
[1:09:54] this happened before
[1:09:56] and they walk over on dry land and he
[1:09:58] commands them to take the 12 stones to
[1:10:00] be as a token or a sign that this is
[1:10:03] what's happened because god was with him
[1:10:05] and he got each one of the tribes of of
[1:10:07] israel to go and pick up a stone and put
[1:10:09] it on as a as a as a heritage as a sign
[1:10:12] for the generation forward that it's the
[1:10:14] same message
[1:10:16] i hope you catch this now it's the same
[1:10:18] message that paul preached
[1:10:20] same message
[1:10:23] same thing and then god moves on and
[1:10:25] says now i'm gonna get joshua to put you
[1:10:26] in the land
[1:10:28] same message that came okay that paul
[1:10:31] preached
[1:10:32] brother branham went past the curtain of
[1:10:33] time when he was standing there what did
[1:10:35] he said he said is paul going to be
[1:10:37] judged for everything he preached
[1:10:40] and then the angel of the lord says to
[1:10:42] him yes he says good because i preached
[1:10:44] what paul preached
[1:10:46] and all of us
[1:10:47] yes i'm going to say it again all of us
[1:10:50] said
[1:10:51] we count on that brother branham
[1:10:54] that's what i rest on
[1:10:56] because i'm not following
[1:10:58] evil devised
[1:11:00] little cult thingy wings what people
[1:11:01] make i don't follow lies i follow the
[1:11:03] word of god because everything that was
[1:11:05] preached in that message came back to
[1:11:07] this book
[1:11:08] not outside of the scope it's not
[1:11:10] outside of the book it's all in there
[1:11:12] okay so now let's get serious so now
[1:11:15] and it came to pass when the kings and
[1:11:16] the
[1:11:17] amorites
[1:11:18] on the other side win which were on the
[1:11:20] other side okay it was on the side of
[1:11:22] jordan westward and all the kings of the
[1:11:24] canaanites
[1:11:26] which were by the sea heard that the
[1:11:28] lord had dried up the waters of the
[1:11:30] jordan before the children of israel
[1:11:34] until we were passed over that their
[1:11:37] hearts
[1:11:38] melted and there was
[1:11:41] um and the end
[1:11:44] there was their spirit what neither was
[1:11:47] there a spirit in them anymore because
[1:11:50] of the children of israel
[1:11:52] okay
[1:11:53] now i'm gonna gonna bring to you it just
[1:11:56] like the lord said i hope you receive it
[1:11:57] that way
[1:11:59] so you walk
[1:12:01] in the footsteps where god
[1:12:03] leads you amen
[1:12:05] you got children you're praying for
[1:12:08] you've got love once you're praying for
[1:12:10] moms and dads
[1:12:12] people that look that they're really
[1:12:14] outside of the economy of god
[1:12:17] do you know
[1:12:18] that that demon
[1:12:20] sitting right there deceiving them
[1:12:23] is scared of you
[1:12:27] don't look at the veil
[1:12:29] don't look at the reaction don't look at
[1:12:31] the circumstance don't look at the fight
[1:12:33] back the kick back the arguments don't
[1:12:35] look at that do you know that because if
[1:12:38] you're under the commission of the lord
[1:12:40] and you're walking as the lord is
[1:12:41] guiding you that demon is scared of you
[1:12:43] because these kings as much as they
[1:12:45] rallied if you go to chapter nine they
[1:12:48] all rallied together okay after jericho
[1:12:51] fell they all rallied together against
[1:12:53] israel why
[1:12:55] because they were scared and once you
[1:12:57] walked your way with the lord and you
[1:12:59] chose to walk with the lord it seems
[1:13:02] like all hell breaks loose in your life
[1:13:04] but it's because the enemies are scared
[1:13:06] because they know who is with you
[1:13:09] [Applause]
[1:13:11] they know is with you
[1:13:13] amen
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:17] joshua 5 verse 11
[1:13:20] and they did eat of the old corner of
[1:13:23] the land and of the morrow after the
[1:13:24] past over unleavened cakes and parched
[1:13:27] corn in the south same day okay
[1:13:30] and the men are seized in the morrow
[1:13:35] so now god makes it difficult
[1:13:38] i mean we were fed our shoes were good
[1:13:40] our clothes weren't wore out i get into
[1:13:43] the promised land and you stop my food
[1:13:47] and it's getting hard and all of a
[1:13:50] sudden people don't like me and and
[1:13:52] people that used to be my friends walk
[1:13:54] away from me and loved ones that's close
[1:13:56] to me is kicking against me and all
[1:13:57] these things are happening why
[1:14:00] because god is making you ready for war
[1:14:05] for war
[1:14:06] not your brother and sister not the one
[1:14:09] that's kicking back for that thing that
[1:14:11] is sitting there that's scared of you
[1:14:13] but if you are in baby mode and you're
[1:14:15] just drinking milk in honeymoon mode who
[1:14:17] is ever on a honeymoon
[1:14:19] nobody else matters than your sweetheart
[1:14:22] you're just in love
[1:14:24] so if somebody would have attacked you
[1:14:25] say i want your wallet you want to go
[1:14:27] yeah yeah there you go have that one
[1:14:29] yeah just don't touch my love
[1:14:31] you wouldn't fight someone says i'm
[1:14:33] going to take your life you'll go yeah
[1:14:35] okay we'll get there now can i just
[1:14:36] she's so beautiful
[1:14:39] because you're in love but see god has
[1:14:41] to he has met you you you've chosen the
[1:14:44] way through water baptism which is the
[1:14:45] water okay in the name of jesus christ
[1:14:48] you chose your way you get through that
[1:14:50] water and boom all the hell eats you and
[1:14:52] you're thinking man what's going on
[1:14:54] can i not get a break
[1:14:56] all i come here is for peace love love
[1:14:58] long suffering meekness gentleness
[1:15:00] kindness and all i'm getting is pushback
[1:15:03] you're right where you're supposed to be
[1:15:05] you are right where you're supposed to
[1:15:06] be
[1:15:07] because god is training you for a
[1:15:09] greater battle than to be fought just
[1:15:12] with the sword
[1:15:13] because the sword cuts both ways and it
[1:15:16] can kill and it can heal be careful
[1:15:19] we're not here to fight with the word of
[1:15:20] god we're here to surrender to the word
[1:15:22] of god amen
[1:15:25] i've seen a lot of bible punching in my
[1:15:27] life that just doesn't get you anywhere
[1:15:29] hey brother head
[1:15:32] so
[1:15:33] god took it all away and now they
[1:15:35] started eating of the fruit of the land
[1:15:36] that year
[1:15:38] okay
[1:15:40] which is also nice
[1:15:42] because once you go through a trial
[1:15:44] man does it feel nice to just kick the
[1:15:46] devil in his face say he comes back
[1:15:49] but one time one time god delivered
[1:15:52] someone or one time when it spoke a
[1:15:54] season somebody came back and said man
[1:15:56] god you spoke to me through you thank
[1:15:58] you i've got hope i've got i've got
[1:16:00] something to hold on to we had a lady at
[1:16:02] work and i'm paraphrasing or going off
[1:16:03] it again she said please help me because
[1:16:06] immigration
[1:16:07] doesn't want us to stay here
[1:16:09] and and in december the 12th she should
[1:16:11] have been out of the country what do i
[1:16:13] do
[1:16:14] i said don't listen
[1:16:16] to the obvious
[1:16:17] say to it just like that don't listen
[1:16:19] and believe what this is currently
[1:16:21] stating see i said are you a believer
[1:16:24] she goes yeah i'm a believer
[1:16:26] i said okay so you believe hey yeah so
[1:16:28] you think the almighty god that created
[1:16:30] heaven and earth cannot sign your
[1:16:32] document and give you a residency
[1:16:35] she goes i needed that
[1:16:37] i said well then take it
[1:16:40] don't just sign needed that and don't
[1:16:42] take it
[1:16:43] proclaim it speak it i said because it's
[1:16:45] easy to say the obvious it's hard to see
[1:16:48] the unseen and it's hard to speak the
[1:16:50] unseen when the obvious is right in
[1:16:52] front of your face
[1:16:54] look at the unsee
[1:16:59] and sorry if we're dragging on but we're
[1:17:00] going
[1:17:02] now the rest of the camp of israel god
[1:17:04] stops everything and now they're
[1:17:06] fighting for everything and it came to
[1:17:07] pass verse 13. now here i wanted this is
[1:17:10] this is where it is and we all know this
[1:17:12] piece may god make it so real to you
[1:17:16] right now so joshua walks out
[1:17:19] in the morning in the morrow
[1:17:21] and he's walking and he's looking
[1:17:23] at jericho
[1:17:25] yeah and he thinks battle logistics
[1:17:28] how's this gonna go of course guess what
[1:17:32] the first verse of the next one will go
[1:17:34] there now i said okay wait wait so he
[1:17:35] looks at this okay just remember i'm
[1:17:37] gonna come back to that remind me of
[1:17:39] what
[1:17:40] he saw
[1:17:43] and it came to pass joshua by jericho he
[1:17:45] lifted his eyes and looked up and behold
[1:17:47] he stood a man over him
[1:17:49] against him with his sword drawn in his
[1:17:51] hand and joshua went to him and said i
[1:17:53] thou for us
[1:17:54] or for our adversaries
[1:18:00] now all your moms and dads
[1:18:03] this is for you
[1:18:06] husbands wives this is for you
[1:18:09] and he said nay but as the captain of
[1:18:11] the host of the lord i now come
[1:18:17] and joshua fell on his face onto the
[1:18:19] earth and he did worship and said unto
[1:18:20] him what saith my lord unto thy servant
[1:18:23] and now god look how how perfect god is
[1:18:26] yesterday today and forever the same he
[1:18:28] says to him and the captain of the lord
[1:18:30] of the host said unto joshua lose thy
[1:18:33] shoe from thy foot for the place where
[1:18:35] on our stand is holy amen
[1:18:38] so he's proving to joshua that what i
[1:18:40] said to moses and all the accounts
[1:18:42] before egypt before you even got this
[1:18:45] promised land
[1:18:46] when i met jo um moses i said to him
[1:18:48] loose thy shoes off
[1:18:51] i'm that same one i am the i am
[1:18:54] there is no greater than me
[1:18:56] and if you fall down in humility god can
[1:18:59] act on that though he tells you i'll
[1:19:02] take over though he comes because of
[1:19:04] just a previous verse he says i'm here
[1:19:06] to take over but just before you get all
[1:19:08] arrogant and think hey i've got it
[1:19:11] take your shoes off
[1:19:14] in humility
[1:19:15] because we're not going to fight it your
[1:19:18] way
[1:19:18] we're going to fight this fight my way
[1:19:22] okay
[1:19:23] amen
[1:19:24] so tonight the captain with the sword
[1:19:27] draught comes to each one of us and he's
[1:19:29] telling us if your demon that is against
[1:19:32] you say you cannot get over him i'm
[1:19:35] telling you you're right but i can
[1:19:38] i can get over that thing i can overcome
[1:19:41] i can create i am the i am i will show
[1:19:45] you things that you don't know about
[1:19:47] if you could just let go i can
[1:19:51] don't tell me what i can't do because my
[1:19:53] sword is drawn and my sword brings peace
[1:19:56] life and death to anyone that is against
[1:19:58] the word of god
[1:20:00] but he does the work
[1:20:02] as zealous as we are we cannot do that
[1:20:05] work
[1:20:07] we can just surrender
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:11] now
[1:20:12] joshua chapter 6
[1:20:14] and here it comes
[1:20:16] verse 1.
[1:20:19] now you got that
[1:20:20] teenager
[1:20:22] you got that child that brother that you
[1:20:24] know that is 45 years old and he knows
[1:20:27] everything about everything or that dad
[1:20:29] in my case and dad forgive me because
[1:20:32] i'm just using a testimony
[1:20:34] that just don't want to budge
[1:20:37] no matter how much you throw the word at
[1:20:38] him he does not want to budge
[1:20:41] and it says and jericho was straightly
[1:20:43] shut up because of the children of
[1:20:45] israel because of who
[1:20:47] because of you
[1:20:50] and none went out and none came in
[1:20:54] so your teenager
[1:20:55] is standing there
[1:20:57] and there is a demon sitting right in
[1:20:59] him saying i don't believe the word of
[1:21:01] god
[1:21:03] and you know what i ain't coming out
[1:21:08] hey
[1:21:09] i don't believe what you're telling me
[1:21:12] mom and dad and i'm preaching it to
[1:21:14] myself because i did exactly the same
[1:21:16] when i was there my parents tried to
[1:21:18] convince me and i convinced myself
[1:21:20] otherwise
[1:21:21] because there was something in me that
[1:21:23] was defying that and i said i will not
[1:21:26] be moved
[1:21:30] now if you look at this state
[1:21:33] how's those walls going to come down
[1:21:36] how are you going to reach those peoples
[1:21:38] because remember we when we and we're
[1:21:40] going to get to what what
[1:21:42] what joshua said but remember when they
[1:21:45] now starting to go and putting in an
[1:21:46] action and god says to him through
[1:21:48] joshua and he says and the lord said
[1:21:50] unto joshua i've given you
[1:21:52] i've given it into your hand jericho and
[1:21:55] the king thereof and the mighty men of
[1:21:58] allah so god says i've given you your
[1:22:00] child
[1:22:02] are you listening i gave you your child
[1:22:05] amen
[1:22:07] he might not be budging
[1:22:09] but i gave him to you
[1:22:11] and who's going to fight this battle
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:15] so love them
[1:22:17] love them as much as you can love anyone
[1:22:20] but don't doubt that
[1:22:23] god cannot turn them around
[1:22:25] don't doubt that and it shall
[1:22:28] compass that in the city with all the
[1:22:30] men of war go around the city once thou
[1:22:33] shalt go six days
[1:22:35] and the seven priests shall be before
[1:22:36] thee the ark and we can stay here
[1:22:38] forever so so i'm trying to get through
[1:22:40] it sorry guys
[1:22:42] um and the seven trumpets of the rams
[1:22:44] once in the seventh day you shall
[1:22:45] compass the city seven times
[1:22:48] and the priest shall blow
[1:22:50] with the trumpets and it shall come past
[1:22:52] come to pass that when they make a long
[1:22:54] blast in the rams horn and you they hear
[1:22:56] the sound of the trumpet the people
[1:22:58] shall shout and a great shout and the
[1:23:01] wall of the city shall fell down flat
[1:23:03] now have you noticed god said nothing
[1:23:05] about rayam

[1:23:21] and the people say praise her
[1:23:24] amen because he's here and he's worthy
[1:23:25] of all praise

[1:23:29] plan which he gives to joshua he says
[1:23:32] this you shall do but nowhere in this

[1:24:17] ark of the lord went on continually and
[1:24:20] blew the trumpets and the armed men went
[1:24:23] before them but um but the reward came
[1:24:26] after the ark of the lord and the
[1:24:28] priests going were blowing the trumpets
[1:24:30] and the second day came to pass and the

[1:25:21] so i preached to my children and i
[1:25:22] preached to my children and i preached
[1:25:24] to my children but nothing is happening
[1:25:26] and i'm praying to god and i'm praying
[1:25:27] to god and i'm praying to god and
[1:25:28] nothing's happening but you're only on
[1:25:30] your sixth day

[1:25:51] go off and they're going like seriously
[1:25:53] go on these guys fight
[1:25:54] we got these walls we impenetrable you
[1:25:57] shall not move me
[1:25:59] but god had another vision
[1:26:01] and now here comes the here it is boys
[1:26:03] wake up children
[1:26:05] brother sisters it came to pass on the
[1:26:07] seventh day that they rose up early
[1:26:10] and of the dawning of the day and they
[1:26:12] composed as verse 15 the city after the
[1:26:14] same manner seven times only on that day
[1:26:17] they could pass the city seven times and
[1:26:19] it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:26:24] when the priest blew the trumpets joshua
[1:26:28] joshua
[1:26:29] the prophet
[1:26:30] shouted
[1:26:32] he shouted and listen what he says he
[1:26:34] says for the lord have given you the
[1:26:36] city and the city shall be accursed
[1:26:39] so don't go into the world children it's
[1:26:41] accursed
[1:26:42] prophet said you can't serve god and
[1:26:44] mammon stay with god it's a curse and
[1:26:47] whatever you're going to go find out in
[1:26:48] the city you bring it back home it's
[1:26:50] gonna cost you a whole lot of trouble
[1:26:54] i've been there
[1:26:55] oh yeah
[1:26:57] still some sweeping out some trouble
[1:26:58] sometimes
[1:27:00] he says for therefore he says even it
[1:27:04] and all that are therein
[1:27:06] unto the lord to the lord so he's saying
[1:27:08] everything in that city is a curse to
[1:27:10] the lord he wants nothing to do with
[1:27:12] that
[1:27:13] but
[1:27:15] only rahab and the harlot shall live she
[1:27:18] and all that is with her in the house
[1:27:20] because she hit the messengers
[1:27:22] that were sent
[1:27:24] and ye in any wise keep yourselves from
[1:27:26] the accursed thing there's your warning
[1:27:28] stay out of it you cannot serve two gods
[1:27:30] you can't be you can't you can't say i
[1:27:33] love the message but and i want to do
[1:27:35] everything else
[1:27:36] love god walk with god
[1:27:39] if he corrects you walk with god don't
[1:27:41] go find some other stuff because you'll
[1:27:42] only get into trouble
[1:27:44] ask aiken and his whole family that was
[1:27:46] destroyed don't go there
[1:27:49] he says and make the camp of israel a
[1:27:51] curse or trouble it so he's warning them
[1:27:53] don't go into the world because what you
[1:27:54] get in the world you bring back here and
[1:27:57] if you want to have unity in this camp
[1:28:00] and we don't people want to die don't
[1:28:02] bring worldly manners and worldly
[1:28:04] statements and worldly ways of thinking
[1:28:06] into this church because here we are
[1:28:08] spiritually minded
[1:28:10] we think about god we think about the
[1:28:12] promises of god the prophet of god says
[1:28:15] if thou can believe all things are
[1:28:16] possible what does the world seize days
[1:28:18] and miracles are over you bring that in
[1:28:20] here you will never
[1:28:22] never get healed
[1:28:24] never
[1:28:25] if you follow opinions of a man and you
[1:28:27] come into this church and and something
[1:28:29] that someone did they said i agreed with
[1:28:31] brother ben until he preached that
[1:28:33] well you didn't listen to god because it
[1:28:34] wasn't brother ben preaching
[1:28:37] so when you come here be corrected
[1:28:40] leave all those other things around
[1:28:41] men's opinions and you know there was
[1:28:43] one time i and i'm gonna i'm about to
[1:28:45] close so
[1:28:46] there was one time where um
[1:28:48] someone told me
[1:28:51] that david had two stones in his hand
[1:28:53] before he went to goliath because the
[1:28:55] other four stones represented hope
[1:28:57] so i heard that and i said that's a lie
[1:29:00] i said the bible said he had one stone
[1:29:01] in his end
[1:29:02] i said and before he went to goliath he
[1:29:04] prophesied i'm gonna i'm gonna kill you
[1:29:06] and i'm gonna cut off your head with my
[1:29:07] sword
[1:29:08] he didn't have show he wasn't hoping he
[1:29:10] had faith
[1:29:12] and with faith he knew he can overcome
[1:29:14] that he only needed one because the
[1:29:15] other four was for his brothers so so
[1:29:18] when we hear things like that and we
[1:29:19] start believing those things it's taking
[1:29:21] away from what is really the truth and
[1:29:23] it makes everything a watery washing
[1:29:25] down thing and you can do exactly just
[1:29:27] what you do as long as just before you
[1:29:29] die you run to the altar and say god
[1:29:30] forgive me then everything's fine
[1:29:33] don't work like that
[1:29:34] many men don't get to 96 many a children
[1:29:37] don't even get to the age of seven
[1:29:40] so don't you think children you've got
[1:29:41] another 50 years ahead of you life ain't
[1:29:44] guarantee when god calls you calls you
[1:29:46] be ready
[1:29:48] be ready amen
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:51] now
[1:29:53] out of the same mouth proceed of
[1:29:54] blessing and cursing my brethren these
[1:29:57] things ought not to be so though the
[1:29:59] fountain sent forth the same place sweet
[1:30:03] water and bitter can a fig tree many um
[1:30:06] uh my brethren be olive berries that's
[1:30:09] in james three verse twelve and figs
[1:30:13] so can no fountain both yield salt water
[1:30:16] and fresh
[1:30:18] now i come now come down this is where
[1:30:20] my my sermon
[1:30:22] hopefully the lord will take over now
[1:30:23] and i'll read this lost
[1:30:26] if you
[1:30:27] believe
[1:30:29] you can have it
[1:30:32] okay
[1:30:33] if you are a believer and god said it's
[1:30:36] yours it's yours
[1:30:38] if you want more of god there is more of
[1:30:40] god to get
[1:30:42] please don't let this spin this speak
[1:30:44] contrary to what you believe
[1:30:47] if you claimed your healing
[1:30:49] receive your healing walk in your
[1:30:51] healing it's not mind over matter it's
[1:30:54] spoken word and the very very first
[1:30:57] sermon
[1:30:58] that that touched my heart
[1:31:00] was the spoken word why
[1:31:02] because the prophet of god showed us
[1:31:04] that we have to speak
[1:31:07] and on that god comes down and he and he
[1:31:09] sees our faith and he acts on our faith
[1:31:11] and he goes and gets the promises that
[1:31:13] he makes because this whole war of
[1:31:15] jericho when the wars fell down and
[1:31:18] rahab and everybody was still standing
[1:31:20] that was god doing it but joshua and
[1:31:22] caleb believed and it says as the walls
[1:31:25] will fall down straightway go in
[1:31:28] so the walls didn't fall there and they
[1:31:29] ran there and go in god was so mindful
[1:31:32] that while they were marching the walls
[1:31:33] were falling right in front of them and
[1:31:35] they could straightway go in and go get
[1:31:36] the enemy think about it and let's say
[1:31:38] right around the city and then go in he
[1:31:40] says just go in it's yours so if god
[1:31:42] promised you something don't go around
[1:31:44] about it just go in and claim it it's
[1:31:46] yours the walls will fall no matter how
[1:31:49] much that demon sits there no matter how
[1:31:51] much that thing defies you god said it's
[1:31:53] yours you go claim it
[1:31:55] you go claim it he says but the day has
[1:31:58] come where the gospel light is shining
[1:32:00] theology and christian churches is dying
[1:32:02] it's failed god is talking now and he's
[1:32:06] revealing himself again
[1:32:08] through his church
[1:32:10] the resurrected body of the lord jesus
[1:32:12] christ resurrected out of church empty
[1:32:15] resurrected out of cold formal churches
[1:32:17] resurrected out of fanaticism god is
[1:32:20] bringing forth a bunch of bones that is
[1:32:22] putting on skin and the power of the
[1:32:24] holy ghost that brings the gospel and
[1:32:26] these last days with signs and wonders
[1:32:29] to the end of the world
[1:32:31] they'll teach the bible they'll stand by
[1:32:34] it they will live by it they cannot
[1:32:36] compromise they will not go to the left
[1:32:38] or right they will stand right with the
[1:32:40] word and move on as god was with them
[1:32:44] daily confirming the word with signs and
[1:32:46] wonders following hallelujah
[1:32:49] stay by god stay on the word and go and
[1:32:52] get your land
[1:32:54] it's a supernatural war you cannot look
[1:32:57] with carnality you will fail you have to
[1:33:00] look with god's eyes and if anything
[1:33:03] tells you it cannot it's a lie and you
[1:33:06] just push it down and you walk on
[1:33:08] because guess what the guys that said it
[1:33:11] was a lie where that they end up
[1:33:15] it's it's
[1:33:16] where did the israelites that that said
[1:33:18] they couldn't get that land end up that
[1:33:20] gave the negative report
[1:33:22] back in the desert they died
[1:33:25] we ain't that people brothers sisters we
[1:33:27] ain't that people we are believers
[1:33:30] and if if there is something that's
[1:33:31] telling you tonight you don't need to
[1:33:33] believe it's a lie and you rebuke that
[1:33:36] spirit
[1:33:37] and you move on
[1:33:40] because god honors a man that can stand
[1:33:42] for him
[1:33:43] and a sister
[1:33:44] certificate about the woman so god bless
[1:33:46] you i'm sorry it comes out sometimes a
[1:33:48] bit strong but as the missions come from
[1:33:51] musicians come forward maybe let's just
[1:33:52] sing a song
[1:33:55] let's sing that i went to the enemies
[1:33:57] camp
[1:33:58] because because the thing is when we
[1:33:59] look at the scriptures and we look at
[1:34:02] at the prophets and all those things
[1:34:04] it's hard to believe that it actually
[1:34:05] pertains to our life but it is a type of
[1:34:07] you
[1:34:08] you know and and as much as it's a type
[1:34:10] of you the lord put it there to unlock
[1:34:12] it and soon and see the season in your
[1:34:14] life to get you to a place where god can
[1:34:16] deal with you don't bet these things no
[1:34:18] matter what you do do not bet them
[1:34:21] brothers and sisters i encourage you
[1:34:23] don't bet it it's real
[1:34:25] who wants to see miracles
[1:34:27] who has seen miracles
[1:34:30] so that miracle working god
[1:34:32] he's still here
[1:34:34] look the world's gonna always keep you
[1:34:36] busy
[1:34:38] it's always gonna be contrary to the
[1:34:39] word
[1:34:40] it's if thou canst believe
[1:34:43] amen so let's all stand up and proclaim
[1:34:45] the song
[1:34:47] and we'll just
[1:34:48] the reason i think we went to the
[1:34:49] enemies camp is who's got somebody
[1:34:51] that's in the camp
[1:34:52] who's got somebody that's captured
[1:34:55] who is somebody that's got unconfessed
[1:34:56] sin who is somebody that needs to work
[1:34:59] with the lord
[1:35:00] and say lord help me
[1:35:03] oh that's me
[1:35:04] so go to the enemy's camp get your peace
[1:35:07] get your healing get your brother get
[1:35:09] your sister get someone that wronged you
[1:35:12] get everyone get who you can out of that
[1:35:14] enemy's camp
[1:35:16] because the walls might be shut up but
[1:35:18] who can drop the walls amen let's sing
[1:35:21] that song while i went to the enemy scam
[1:35:24] what did i do and i i took back what he
[1:35:28] stole from me
[1:35:30] i took back what he stole from me
[1:35:34] i took back what he stole from me yes i
[1:35:37] went to the enemy's camp what did i
[1:35:40] do i took back what he stole from me
[1:35:44] cause he's under my feet he's under my
[1:35:47] feet he's under my feet he's under my
[1:35:51] feet satan is under my feet let's sing
[1:35:54] your children i went to the enemy god
[1:35:57] yeah you
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:01] what did you do
[1:36:04] take back that piece
[1:36:06] take back that temper
[1:36:08] hey man oh i went to the enemy's camp
[1:36:13] and i i took back i take my healing
[1:36:17] cause you're under my feet he's under
[1:36:20] your feet he's under your feet he's
[1:36:23] under your feet
[1:36:25] under your feet he's under yours saying
[1:36:27] it again he's under your feet he's under
[1:36:30] your feet where's satan satan is under
[1:36:33] my feet amen hallelujah
[1:36:37] amen
[1:36:38] well let's just close in the word of
[1:36:40] prayer if there's anybody tonight
[1:36:42] that the devil has been lying too much i
[1:36:44] don't think we always have to end at
[1:36:45] this very serious note because you know
[1:36:48] what god knows you
[1:36:50] and no matter how much i try to make an
[1:36:52] atmosphere i pray that god gets so real
[1:36:54] route to you
[1:36:55] i pray that the lord jesus touches you
[1:36:57] right now
[1:36:59] and he reveals to you what are you
[1:37:00] hiding
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:03] because i didn't come and give this
[1:37:04] message this was the lord
[1:37:06] and i believe that the reason this is
[1:37:08] here is because these people that need
[1:37:11] to get those walls dropped down and
[1:37:13] claim their promise
[1:37:15] so let's just pray together if you have
[1:37:17] any promise that has been taken from you
[1:37:19] anything that's lying to you in the name
[1:37:21] of jesus christ i ask you lift your
[1:37:23] hands
[1:37:24] and you proclaim it to the lord and you
[1:37:26] speak to our god and you say lord
[1:37:29] i need it
[1:37:30] i need your help lord i am trapped
[1:37:33] i don't know lord what to do but i know
[1:37:36] i believe
[1:37:37] because i am under the joshua and caleb
[1:37:39] banned and lord i know that what you're
[1:37:42] going to do is fight for me and i know
[1:37:44] you're going to help me to overcome lord
[1:37:45] jesus so tonight let's pray together
[1:37:48] brothers and sisters and say lord please
[1:37:52] please have mercy father
