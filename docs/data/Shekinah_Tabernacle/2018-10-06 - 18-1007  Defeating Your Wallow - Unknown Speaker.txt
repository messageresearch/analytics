numbers the 13th chapter we'll see if this all it's on the can I Drive it I'll go I'm driving there also numbers 13 we're just going to read this portion of Scripture but we're gonna not just stay here but numbers 13 25 we're gonna read down to we're gonna read the just a few verses here down to verse 33 it says here from and we read this on Sunday but it's gonna take it from a different angle so numbers 13 and verse 25 and they returned from searching of the land after forty days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron into all the congregation of the children of Israel and to the wilderness of paran to Kadish and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told and they told them and said we've come into the land whether thou sent us us and surely a flaw earth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there and there the Amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the Hittites and the jebusites and the Amorite Stowell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan and caleb still the people before Moses and said let us go but once and possess it if we were able to overcome it but the people that we're not with them said we are not able to go up against the people for they're stronger than we be and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched under the children of Israel saying the land which we had God to search it at his land that eateth up inhabitants thereof and all the people that saw we saw in it a men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the son of anak which came of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight amen may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats now I want to and we're going to come into it later but I want to talk about standing your ground and defeating your wallow you don't want to you want to get rid of your wallow and so I'm going to go into that today Helu you know it's amazing when you know basically the devil left but he but he left his bags so you know be with me amen delivery can be slow so does Amen but praise the Lord now it's amazing when you look at this report we're so little was put on how great the land was this land was filled with milk and honey they even brought the evidence back but they spent their time looking at the negative I'd like to stand in Caleb's shoes and Joshua's shoes for a moment we they said were able to go up at once and take it and possess it were able to overcome it no doubt they were looking at the promise they were looking at how good the land was and we know that we have entered into a a new age of bride age where brother Brown says in the invisible Union he says the Pilgrim Fathers were very thankful for their newfound way of life this is when they left Europe and went to went to America being separated from the Old English denominations and Creed they could marry to the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word for their age for the day so we can be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world all of our associates Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all the dead religions I'm speaking across the nation now all the dead Creed's and to what separated us and open to us a new land the message for this day so he's opened a new land for us he's opened his word for us I mean a land has come open before us and it's a glorious land there's a resurrection in the land there's healing in the land there's redemption in the land there's peace in the land there's joy in the land amen there's joy and peaceful yo joy unspeakable full of glory I'm in this rest I'm in this overcoming power there's deliverance there's a rapture I mean there's all things I mean Jesus Christ is the land the son of man is the land hallelujah so he's opened up he's opened up a new message a new word for this day I mean which is the word has come open to us the Bible has become open to us as a new book it's not a book of mystery we're not wondering what's in it we're not wondering what belongs to us we know what belongs to us in the land hallelujah we know the land belongs to us we're not worried about what the enemy may try and put there and try and push us back I mean it belongs to you and I so we should press in and take every part of that land hallelujah so we've been I mean so we have we have been separated God has separate us from all dead man's religion I mean that we are united we are married for the anointed word for our age which is Jesus Christ the word hallelujah that's why they were thankful that's why we're thankful amen so now and then the brother Bram also says he sees in the message proving his word he said by God in the midst of all of it he raised up a prophet a son of a priest speaking of John the Baptist here went into the wilderness at nine years old couldn't read his name if it wasn't the leader the size of a boxcar why why did he do it he was a prophet if he had been trained in the education of his father he probably would have been a Pharisee or said you see or one of their groups but he had an important job it was to announce the Messiah because why God kept his word and proved it a voice of one crying from the seminary know behold I've got my doctor's degree that might have been in the old lady birthday Almanac but not in God's Word he said the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way the Lord make his paths straight was he preparing the way of the word then that word can be made manifest hallelujah don't you see in the shadows stop here for a minute in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest and we're now living by the evidence of the new man new land amen the son of man I mean so we're living by the evidence of the new land Jesus Christ himself hallelujah now it's a glorious land hallelujah healing is in the land divine healing is in the land we've seen healing among us as the children's bread it belongs to us I'm in redemptions in the land the body changes in the land joy is in the land but you've got to stand in your land you've got to put you got to possess your land you can't let the enemy come in and come in like a flood and just take over you've got to stand amen in your land and we see we're just going to read this from SiC and Samuel I mean here's here's the I know I've spoken along these lines before but here we have the account of David's mighty men this is these be the names of the mighty men whom David had the attachment night that sent in the seat chief among the captains the same was a do that is night he lifted up a spear against eight hundred whom he slew and after him was le the son of a dodo the o'night one of the mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were gathered to give it to battle and the men of Israel were gone away he arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand claimant of the sword and the Lord brought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil and after him was Shama the son of eggie the Hara right and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop when where was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the Philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines and the Lord wrought a great victory you know I read a thing in the paper about training the SAS and the people that go for selection to the if I knows who the SAS are they're the elite of the army of New Zealand either there are special forces and they train them in such a way that the only way the people can actually get into the SAS is because they have an inner drive they they they take them on training till their physical strength is gone all their reserves are godly mental capacity is God and the only way they can get in is because of an inner drive in them and that's how they get part of that army I mean it's the same thing with the bride I mean there's an inner drive hollow in the believer that when all strength is gone even your understanding is gone you don't know where everything is there's something and you said I'm part of the Lord's army I'm gonna take the Lane I'm going to defeat my enemy hallelujah there's something in you that's greater than your flesh that's greater than the enemy better than your mind I mean it's a seed of God hallelujah have confidence in that seed hallelujah see here they were leave this is not a we did not read a an account of a choreographed battle from Hollywood these are men I mean flesh and blood like you and I but they were anointed they knew their King was empower and was coming into power hallelujah they stood in their land they didn't care what the enemy through them I mean they ain't care if you don't house Lee they stood in their inheritance hallelujah to God and they defeated their enemy now well I just I'll just drop this in before we kind of go another way now it's amazing the word Philistine because I like it when the Bible becomes on our address it's all very well I yes standing your ground part of the root word of Philistine that means to roll in the dust to wallow it's what it's part of the root word of the meaning Philistine it means to to roll in the dust to wallow now a wallow is a place where animals like a pig we see elephants or big big mammals or even you know they gon wallow in in in mud or and water and the purpose of this is it's a place with a lie around roll around in mud or water to keep cool and to avoid biting insects a wallow is a place where an animal visits regularly they have their own wallow they have a place and that wallow as I just said is a place to alleviate to get temporary relief from their current circumstances when the bugs bite too much when the Sun gets too hot they go to their wallow they go to the owal oh remember the Philistines came in the wallow came in the wallow came in right here is this wallowing coming in only if you stood against it others read I can't handle this I can't handle this and they ran there into something else but if you stood and they were stood the wallow I'm not gonna roll in this mud I'm not gonna put up with this I'm not gonna find temporary relief in this mud remember an animal the more that they wallow in a wallow the bit of the Warlow comes because it fits them perfectly it's their size as they shake before the animal rolls in it it's just a bit of water a bit of mud on the ground but then they get in and they roll who's ever seen an animal wallow they they roll they get in there they get in their groove and it just fits them just right and so the wallow is actually made by the animal the wallah doesn't make itself it's the animal rolling there that makes the wallow the more they lie in there and they roll the better and more satisfied they become because it fits them just right right people have many different wallows amen people have many different Wohlers today and they think they're getting temporary relief they have the wallows of movies they have the wallows of music because they're trying to escape people are trying to escape they're you know it's like bugs abiding you I need to escape this situation so I got my Waller and then the bugs don't get me it doesn't take the bugs away doesn't actually change there comes a time rolls on and then the mud gets dried and falls off the bugs come back it doesn't permanently change the situation just gives temporary it's just a temporary escape and people always looking for an escape so movies music the internet is a big wallow you can find anything you want is there a mint often and so this is because they're watering and then people also but the reason people wallow in those things is because they are wallowing in their past or their pain or their pride or their self-pity that's why people wallow amen that's why people work why is people caught up in these things because they're wallowing because something happened to them and so they are wallowing in their part in their past or their pain or their pride or their self pity no one understands me therefore I'll go wallow now I'm not throwing away pain or the past or scars I'm not diminishing those things but what do you do with them do you all owe in them or do you get up or do you just stay in the thing you eat well I'm comfortable this fits me just right they become one with the wall oh the animals do this fits me perfectly I'm used to being here this is the thing we're going to get out to where we we're going to get out from where we used to be our current state of thinking how we think how do people get into a wallows their mind goes a certain way they've trained their thinking it's trained a certain way and you need to say Lord I don't want to be in my Waller how did I end up in this place it's not an accident it's like someone training I know it's very obvious but someone who wins the gold of the Olympics it's not an accident they end up on a podium they train all their whole life is focused to get to that goal and it's the same thing of someone's wallowing in something it's not an accident you're in that place amen I start it's actually there's a motive and a purpose behind it because the devil wants you to wallow he doesn't want you to stand up in your God given inheritance cadiz head off put him on the trophy wall and walk on right he wants you to become his trophy like King Saul became a trophy of the Philistines and their temple because he wallowed in his insufficiency I'm this from the smallest tribe in the country and he had a complex about it and he's so worried about what mental because of that and that's what caused them needed up in that place God doesn't actually set us up to fail right it all depends how you look at the story we know but he was never meant to be King God didn't seal it up seen him up to fail right sorry it's all how you look at the story there's more than one way but you got to look at it God didn't set him up to fail God wanted Israel to succeed and God never sets us up to fail he wants us to succeed he wants us to take a body change he wants the devil to be under your feet he wants him to always be under your feet he wants the devil to be in his place under you that's what God wants for you he wants you to be the manifestation of his word in victory that's what God wants he doesn't send us up to fail but it all depends how we react we are not called to wallow get out of your wall oh don't be comfortable in your wallet amen don't worship your past or your pride or your pain or yourself pity whatever it may be get up what are you doing down there what am i well this happened to me yeah but the Lord is our refuge the Lord is our healer the Lord as our Redeemer the Lord allows things to happen to us write the name of the Lord is a strong tower you know the wallet now I wouldn't call this but you know what our wallah really is I mean the city of refuge Christ Jesus that is the place we should be that is the place we're cool to runnin to hallelujah that is the place that we are can running at us safe amen so running to Jesus Christ the word he is our city of refuge hallelujah we don't need to worry about you and the devil says what does know that that won't work whatever you know worthy it doesn't matter the person was different when they ran to the city they were nasty he worthy to be in this place that you knew is the case against them and they were pointed to that place and they ran and hallelujah it doesn't matter what we think we are there's a city and it's open right into the place you're safe hallelujah that's all you need to do they wouldn't examine what lineage what you passed what's your bank account what's your education well yeah the kids they ran in they were safe hallelujah so now we we have to defeat these things now David was anointed to become king we know that that was not a that was not a mystery when he was anointed by vindicated prophet a ordained prophet Samuel anointed him we know that he was ordained to become king it wasn't a mystery that he was going to become King when he was anointed and if we were there and we really believed samuel was the prophet for the Aged we would have said well it's a foregone conclusion he's going to become king right because we believe that was Samuel doing right but a king is not a king unless he has subjects and a kingdom and last but not least a queen he can't be a king if I put a crown on my head and say I'm the king of New Zealand it said no you made prove it now I'm the king I believe it but I've just got a crown on my head in these I got no jurisdiction I got no I don't have a you know I don't have a kingdom nothing's established under my hand no it's going to be manifested right so so it wasn't but it wasn't a mystery David was going to become king after he is anointed but part of him becoming King was Bathsheba becoming becoming his Queen right his mighty men his subjects rallying under him they weren't there when he was anointed but they were part of the prophecy they were part of that anointing right so now the mystery so so they were part though the mighty mean we read about they were part of him being anointed right Bathsheba was part of him becoming king they weren't included when Samuel said I know you to be king and that and these people will gather too you know but they were part of that anointing right because when David because those are gathered to David and followed him the same anointing that was upon him fell upon them right that's why they did the mighty acts of war fee they did has because the same anointing that caused David to kill Goliath came upon them and they killed their enemies too hallelujah and that was really the proof that they were following that they believed that David was becoming King because the same anointing came upon them hallelujah and it's the same thing with us now the bride of Jesus Christ the anointing that was on the bridegroom is on the bride right they're the same life the same victory comes upon comes upon her as well as if one happy this morning can we just rejoice hallelujah we're gonna win I've read the end we're gonna win hallelujah it's all good amen so now the Messiah the Messiah coming to the earth was prophesied since Eden right God Himself promised the serpent promised you know I'm gonna the seat of the woman's gonna come in and do what you've done hallelujah and also in the scripture was the place place of his birth the type of ministry had the manner of his death his resurrection yeah all those things were included but part of that so it was all sitting in the scripture to be manifested but the mystery of the hidden part was Peter James and John right they were part of his ministry the woman at the well Legion Timothy they were seven Church ages there was a fivefold ministry through the ages he was bride Barrow part of the prophecy right just like Adam was manifested upon the earth there was man and woman in him but the mystery in him was was Eve right so she was headed in him and even and then and then when then she was manifested so the mystery was revealed right she was part of him having dominion over the earth and so now as I said the Lord coming the first time having a gentle you know Peter James and John they were part of his ministry the Apostles are part of his ministry the woman at the well Legion Timothy as I see the seventh church ages the Apostle Paul they were all part of of his ministry but they were the unexpressed hidden part but then when he came she was revealed the bride was big revealed hallelujah no I see if I have this now season Luke 2 31 32 now if you read the whole account of look this is this is Jesus being taken to the temple one of my favorite pieces of scripture as a baby to be circumcised dedicated to the Lord and Simon it says earlier in the in the chapter Simon is an old man he's there in the and the assuming whatever his name is you go read it if pronounce things better than me you know he's there and the Lord has told him that he will not die till he sees the Lord's Christ and the Holy Ghost comes upon him and he's led straight to the baby there straight to the Christ child and so he's speaking it's the Holy Ghost speaking through him saying which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel and he says before this behold lit by servant depart in peace because mine eyes have seen thy salvation so now he is saying that the Lord is speaking through him saying that he is the light to lighten the Gentiles but now but you see but in the book of Acts x13 47 this is Paul and Silas speaking to the Jews it says for as much as the lord commander saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the earth now some people read this they say well Paul you're actually just taking Scripture that's apply Jesus trying to apply it to yourself to make yourself something right right kindly that's what people would say this but that is not what it's saying it's that because the same God I mean Jesus the word was manifested as our Redeemer he continuing his ministry through the seven church ages and their ministry started to the Gentiles with Paul and Silas so they were Jesus in them was the light to the Gentiles so it was a continuation of his ministry but then when when when when Simon held him in the temple is an eight-year-old boy I mean I mean a eighth day a day old boy baby when he said this what wasn't a mystery here's the baby but Paul and Silas were the mystery right they were part of that as a continuation of that lujah right so you follow me on there so now I put this up to show you this the unexpressed part is the hidden part down through the Old Testament there's a mystery of a Gentile bride pointing to you Allu you so now as I said Peter James and John the woman at the well Legion Timothy all the believers Lydia the seller of purple Dorcas all the ones in the scripture priscilla and aquila they were the N Express prior but they were part of the prophecy right that part of the word that had to be manifested in the day hallelujah and I'm so glad now when the anointing falls it just shows what's in the person I mean many times people will read Hebrews 6:4 2:9 and they will see it as a negative thing because it says for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away - and you again themselves unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth with drinketh in the rain that come off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by Hermits dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which bear of thorns and briers is rejected as Niantic whose end is to be burned but beloved we are frustrated bitter things of you the things that accompany salvation though we thus speak see saying that the rain falls speaking of the spirit it falls on the ground and it brings forth the life of the seed in the ground hallelujah so it just brings out what's really in someone hallelujah and we should look at this as a negative thing I mean what did it bring out of you the rain of the Spirit when the word fell on you what did it produce hallelujah and either produced a a a Brier with thorns or herbs meat for the improvement stretched hallelujah and produced a life hallelujah so at rest you can rejoice o Lord your spreads fallen your words came upon me and it's brought up your life it's brought out the wheat it's brought out not a tear or a thistle let's brought out your life and me hallelujah and that's why you've got to be born again I mean it's not about making noise in the flesh but God is equipping your soul I mean you gotta come alive get out of your wallow but I like the swallow stand up you know me to be wallowing get up the devil comes and tries to make you wallow you've got to defeat you're wallowing but I'm used to the swallow stop being a creature of habit God doesn't want us to be a creature of bad habits he wants me a creature of his word hallelujah amen you know there will come a time when the Internet is no more Facebook is no more youtubers no more the music industry is no more sport is no more right there come a time Entertainment is no more gossips no more than users no more economics is no more businesses no more right hobbies are no more DIY is no more hallelujah you know their day where are you putting your heart with your harness that's what your treasures are oh but I want to do this and I've seen this and I've seen this it'll be no more it'll be no more sick he first the kingdom of God and His righteousness seek his kingdom and his righteousness I mean his righteousness is God dwelling in you the new birth Jesus Christ in you the word of God in you that is his righteous and these things will be added many times we try and get the added things which we think we need and the devil puts us on a treadmill you know the treadmills will be no more no people you know talking it working these people that well they don't work there but other people are a boss of a so one of my work colleagues her son works up in Auckland and her boss she lives here and her husband lives in Hong Kong they have big careers they only see each other once a year but they've given themselves to their careers what kind of what kind of life is that it'll be but people give themselves give themselves to things that really don't matter get off the wheel you can't you can't finish the wheel it keeps turning and you'll find people run on a wheel and they say this time will be better and it's the same rung that they put their foot on before and they keep disappointed now we're running a bit more and it's the same run the same disappointment when I give this I'll be happy and you're not happy when I give this I'll be happy I'm not happy I'm just trying to find my way let him find your way let him drink your paw I mean he gives us peace and rest that we are actually content in our state that we find ourselves to be hallelujah why are you so relaxed well I meet him why are you not worried he just nonchalant no I'm relaxed I'm a rest because he found me and if he found me he's not going to leave me here he doesn't just meet you just to tickle your religious etch a little but but he finds you a mean to take you into a rapture hallelujah so now it the paint's now so Hebrew going back to Hebrews six it depends what you identify yourself to be are you wheat or you tears right I heard a testimony of two people after they heard brother Branham preach one of them was offended the other one wasn't he said it was wonderful the one who was offended said no he called me a buzzard and the one who thought it was wonderful said well that's funny because he called me an eagle so it depends what you hear it depends what identifies in you right hallelujah and it's not just you and yours it's not just the power of positive thinking it's God coming and identifying what you are a man he says we so where we're right at the end time we're sitting here at the door now waiting for him to come notice God promised in his word he would choose his bride by his original way but there is a way he chose the bridegroom he foretold it by the Prophet sent a prophet to identify the Prophet said sitting on the banks of Jordan behold your they sent you're the Messiah Roger he said no I'm not the Messiah you must be the Messiah but I'm not him but he's standing among you and his shoes I'm not worthy to loosen when he comes he'll make himself known and today he's standing among us now just think about this and today he's standing among us and the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself known because he and the bride and the groom will be the same making himself known and one day you'll see that the one that your field in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and hear one you're united by the word and the word was in the beginning we'll go back to the beginning which is God and in that day you'll know I'm in the father the father and me I in you and you and me hallelujah we're here Holly aces I mean that you would know I mean the very one that you feel and then will become personalized in front of you and you and him become one Hollies and that day this is the day when you know that I'm in the father the father may on you and you and me hallelujah am identifying himself to you now God is building a masterpiece those those mighty men were a masterpiece hallelujah you read when they first gather today but it says everyone who was in debt and discontented and you know that kind of way doesn't say if I knew all together those who have been fighting for years those who had the great strengths those who already mighty men give themselves to David those this let's just read that let's just read that in 1st Samuel I'm so gay I'm so glad God does not know I'm gonna get in trouble I'm in seeking Sam you okay let's go to 1st Samuel it's not on my notes I just okay we're in we're in 1st Samuel 22 first one David therefore departed thence and escaped I will veer to the cave Abdullah and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down headed to him and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves under him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men so look at the state of that I know I've said there's more got to keep these things in front of us sometimes look at the state and the people that gather to him they're there in debt he he paid a debt we could not pay right we needed someone to take our sins away hallelujah we were distressed what's happening to us in this world this world is falling apart what's going to happen we're at the end time who's gonna help me whose goodness hallelujah then we gather ourselves to our David the Lord Jesus right even there was distressed discontented I'm sick of this world there's got to be more to this world than the 9 to 5 and the I remember being a university study I know there's got to be more to life than this it's got to be I'm you know there's got to be more than just this and partying and friends and whatever and you know then he came never ever quench that thirst never ever never ever substitute it with something else because it will never satisfy and the devil tries to hush that holy thirst that God put on here anyways puts fear you don't want to be like those people I would say you want to be like these people Holly all of us in heaven - I'd rather be like this you see people in the world I feel sorry for people in the world they're broken I mean we were we were going we were on the train you know the little train in her was it a Avalon Park yesterday and we're going past the but and there's you know the but with is the little road and there's kids on bikes and stuff on there you know we're just going past and these kids they're at the intersections we've got right away cuz we're bigger than them we're going to Train it's they have to stop for us and you see the things they matter the looks on their faces you know it's a beautiful day you know but people are all wound up and stressed they don't know where they belong they don't know who they are and you know and it's just if one and then they go from that and they become an adult it just becomes worse you know and people think they're havin a big old time in there but on the down on the inside what are they and they're trying to tell you that there's no value don't be oh why would you follow that kind of thing if you only came and tasted the lamb taste in the fruit of the land not just in the will dismiss it grow out hallelujah become one with the land you'll find it's worth it I mean they have a peace that passes all understanding is a glorious thing even in the storm even in the battle even in the trial I mean we have a perfect peace my God will give me the victory we will be victorious in this battle hallelujah we're gonna win this battle I've written the end of the book and I won hallelujah he made us with this way he gives us peace Lord you are the answer I may not know the answer I may not know what to do but you're in control you're the one who ordained these things you're allowed it to happen hallelujah we have to have perfect confidence in our God amen Allu yeah so they became they became a masterpiece I'm sure you can agree those men were the best of the best hallelujah amen they became a masterpiece because they came under the same anointing that David was under because they were part of his kingship right and brother Brown says in the masterpiece message he says now for nearly two thousand years God has been again making himself a masterpiece because he strike atoms to get a piece of him a rub to make a wife room now that perfect masterpiece he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all okay it's just the New Testament when Jesus is holding the communion he says this is the New Testament in my blood so in that Cup was the epistles and that cup was the book of Revelation right and their cup was all the prophecies we read right you're in that cup you're part of them you're part of the word you got a I pray God gives us a revelation we're not here we're not just bystanders we're not just being associated with we are part of the world we are in the Bible you know my girls are ask me last time the dinner table you know about our names being in the Bible I said we are in the Bible you want me to read you some prophecies we're in the Bible and we got a Malachi for behold I send you Elijah the Prophet who's that you who's the euro that's me I'm in the Bible hallelujah yeah let us be glad and rejoice the marriage of the lamb has come who's the lamb or Jesus where is he marrying someone is like him and it was granted to her she'd be arrayed in fine linen clean and why the Rice's of saints who's that that's us hallelujah he was wounded for our transgressions who's to you that's me he was bruised for your iniquities who's that you that's me by His stripes were healed who's that that's me we're in the scripture that's just three examples hallelujah you got to see yourself a new in the Word of God hallelujah no amen glory another peace fulfilled see the new and Old Testaments husband or wife see it's taken than you and taking the alter foreshadow than you Christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another masterpiece in the making as it's taken him four thousand years to make this masterpiece now he's been nearly two thousand years making another masterpiece of Bride for Christ another masterpiece and doings and so doing it he does it by his never-changing method the same way he made the masterpieces word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be a perfect masterpiece when it's the perfect word hallelujah you take the masterpiece of the Old Testament you take those prophets not one of them had it all together right not one of them had it all together you take the Gentile bride's they took they didn't have it all together hallelujah look what God takes to build a masterpiece and we can say oh I'm glad I'm and that can't agree a people amen we are part of us coming the broadest part of the coming seeking coming of Jesus Christ and everything in the scripture God has been revealed being revealing his hidden mystery of the coming of the Lord now God had a purpose in a hidden mystery I'm just gonna I'm just throwing these things out here this is from Christ a mystery God revealed I trust it's very familiar now God had a purpose in a hidden mystery that's what I want to speak to the church this morning the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world even began and how its unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you'll understand clearly then you will you see this on I believe what is being done God's great mystery of hearts a secret he's kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the Angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason I'll thank you hallelujah it's always you get a bit desperate when the water runs dry it you never miss the water till the well runs dry the UM have you heard that have you heard that analogy that's true you know we get so used to things and you miss it when it's gone hallelujah now even the Angels didn't understand us he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open they were silenced Jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come said not even the son of man don't know when it's going to happen see God has it all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space a half hour and the seven thunders uttered their voices and John was even forbidden to write at sea the coming of the Lord that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't know he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in type expressing what God's great dollars and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and God's help will see right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it that's why he'd go back and you see God's the coming of Lord was shown and David becoming King Solomon building the house right with Moses all the way down through all the prophets down through God was expressing his coming and expressing what he would do and a lot of the parts he takes a Gentile bride hallelujah as a shadow pointing to what he'll do and it's coming now I mean pointing to you and I Oh hallelujah amen no way more they say well when will we get victory we're here in 2nd Samuel 5:22 as against the Philistines again against the Wallow the greatest enemy you have is you do you know that we meet what about Satan all the hordes of hell they defeated they got defang they got the armed whatever you want to call it I mean they're they're a big shadow Satan's a bluff you got to call his bluff call his hand you know someone who's bluffing they can pretend real good right if you've ever I trust if you've never done it don't watch it but you see it's like poker they call it a poker face and these people can be they're out but they Bluff all or nothing and now and I'll put on a real good Act and they'll try and someone who's got everything can be intimidated by their bluff and they end up losing further foes all exposed that actually said no you've got nothing I've got at all I'm gonna win and the devil is a good bluff cuz he's cuz right now in this age it's all or nothing he can't hates so whatever you want to call it I don't know I'm not interested but you know it's all or nothing for him and say Bluff you real good you gotta cool this Bluff what's in your hand Satan nothing prophet told me you've been stripped hallelujah and that and their victor is manifested service after service front of thousands of people Satan you're nothing but a bluff take your hands off God's property alright journey by the name of the Living God take your hands off God's property he had to let go hallelujah and he's the same God today I mean enforcing the rights of the bride there were free people now and the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of lithium and when David and quiet of the Lord he said shall he said says the Lord spring thou shall not go up but feature compass around her behind them and come up upon them over against the mulberry trees and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going and the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shall disturb thy self and then shall the Lord go out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines and David did so as the Lord had commanded him and smote the Philistines from giba even until they'll come to to Gaza gazer now notice this he's saying that when you hear the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees this is when you go this is when you get up and fight right so when you hear the South doesn't say the sound of a coming but when you hear the sound of a going right now we are living in a day the rapture is a secret going it's actually it going do you know that the the rapture finishes with a secret going of a bride I mean we're living in the rapture cycle now you understand the lord has descended with a shout right this message is the shout a vindicated ordained prophet told us message is the shop he's early started his coming right he's hearing word form right so now is the sound of a going right there is actually a sound of a going now there's a bride lining herself up with him the word hallelujah we're getting ready to leave I mean we're not ready we're not getting ready that he would come we are not standing there before 63 in the mighty angel descends and the prophet introduces the Lamb of God to the people right it's like John the Baptist we're not standing with John before he points out Jesus Christ we're not there he's we're not living before that time right we are living he's already pointed out the Lamb of God thanks with us in the world and now he's come and now he's preparing his bride to leave you're following what I'm saying right it's the same thing we don't live in the time when it's just the first pull you know taking people by the hand or the discernment the second pull now we're living under the third pole Christ revealed the word revealed God uniting himself with a bride right for a going right so we are living at the time when you hear us the sound of a going and that sound is you the word of God manifested in you are you all following our trust us make seats right at the sound of a gong cuz he's asked when are we going to smart our enemies when you hear the sound of a going hallelujah brother MC is invisible Union and 1965 but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival when she begins to come back and light herself up with the Word of God what's then again you see how that scripture that time there will be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman elect and that message is already swept out this word is going to swept out to catch you away hallelujah that's exactly what's happened we have lifted up above this world we've already started to leaf hallelujah we are astonished as a leaf I'm sorry I like to travel don't you it's exciting you know your passport in your hand on the visa whatever you packed your bags now you waiting for the sound of the going boarding call I've heard my name and if you and if you're a bit like your plane you get cold I can passenger dinner please come to gate dinner your plane is about to leave and that's where we are your name I pray God calls your name the planes about to fly hallelujah you gonna get on board amen don't just sit back and say well I'm enjoying the duty-free the kids about duty-free forget about it get on the plane right hallelujah why would you even miss the book get on the plane the plane is Jesus Christ now he says when you hear the sound of a gang of the tops of the mulberry trees so not at the base of the tree not in the middle of the tree but at the top of the tree now romance brings about the restoration of the bride tree right as we see the fruit at the top of the tree right he says this now he's speaking about the restoration it starts and Luther says of Luther could have gone on it would have been here if weasely would have got on if pentecost would have gone on what on what would they have done now the only one thing can happen there has to be a message of the end time when there is nothing else can follow it and now the key miracle world has set up such a regime that there can be no denomination or nothing to follow else follow it you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is on the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she's ripening into christ-like fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him is his hope you see it I tried to put too much in one day are we you out so look they sold out - reasoning sold out the reasonings of denomination if I can just belong to this my mayor goes to this church if I can be a Methodist or a Presbyterian I say people sell out the reasonings even here well my parents go here I just say I believe it I go along that's just that's not it you got to meet him you're gonna meet the master you gotta meet the Lord Jesus Christ right I just explained them limbs of pruned off they did they're not connecting with Christ any more they'd be bringing forth the same life and I'll connect them whether they act like citrus fruit any fruit can live in a citrus tree but it'll bring its own fruit you put a grapefruit an orange tree to live by orange tree it'll bring full of grapefruit although he sees that the northern ones the in time and all the father has given me in the roots will come to me see you get it oh how we should love him adore him praise him to see the fruit of the Spirit in the last days and a bride tree ripening in the top of the time the true vine and the false vine both have the same anointing the water fell on them both and he sees in the visible union he says get ready the fires gonna fall one of these days God's going to let him come and aside to behold would you be ready when he comes would you really go up with him when he comes the secret rapture of the supernatural bride she'll be made from more mortal to immortality be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye she's saying we're at the top right we're at the top it's like when Paul sees who have come to Mount Zion we know that the base what Matt sign represents the Bride of Christ the base was where the first church age came right and God's been building building building we're not at the bottom or at the top of Mount Zion we're at the peak right the climax with the time where the bride has changed raptured right went over did in Christ rise when she comes to her position that's why we're going to come to our position I mean they're waiting on us they without us cannot be made perfect or complete I mean that's why the life of God manifested and you bring them out of the grave hallelujah so he says now when you hear the sound of a going we still have it there and the tops of the mulberry trees so at the top of the tree where the fruit is being grown again when you hear the sound of it going hallelujah we're living in that time I mean we're living in that time and we are living in the time now where it's going to be a secret it is a secret growing of the church hallelujah so now here we are this is when we've got to rise up and and and defeat our enemy I mean because we hear the sound of it going we see the fruit on the top of the tree we are their fruit right rise up now that's the time now many people get concerned maybe you don't but some people get concerned while the devil's going to close up churches and any church that's not a denomination is going to be closed up and you know because you can't by yourself now to me that's that's after the brides gone because the Lord is here and he is stopping the devil have full control right but when the bride leaves the Holy Ghost leaves the Gentile world I mean that's when the devil s full control in the Gentile world right so now we brother Graham says this in Christ the mystery God revealed is his but he was identified by God so I was saying it he stood alone speaking of Christ his church stands alone she's not hooked up with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelled in in the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil's howling these great organizations set up something to close her up they'll never do it I mean she'll be taken up not closed up she has now risen by the power of the vindicated would promise to her amen how the bride holds that promise he told me he'd return after me and I believe it yes sir you see to meet her headship her redeemer her husband her king her Lord her lover her Savior in the provided meeting place hallelujah he's got a place to meet them you know the bridegroom don't leave out nothing he's got the ring the identification who's got the ring hallelujah he's got the robe that she wears her clothing his righteousness hallelujah who's who's wearing the red wedding garment of his righteousness amen he's got the provided place to meet of us in the year everything's being provided he's got the wedding supper already sick guests already invited already chosen all the angels are standing around his servants and attention he says oh so she won't be closed up she'll be taken up hallelujah that's why we don't need to worry about it now we'll just skip through this last bit quick Sam's hundred forty nine one two three Oh we'll go he's praising the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and praise and his praise in the congregation of Saints letters are rejoice that made him there the children of Israel be joyful in their king let them praise His name in the dance let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp hallelujah for the Lord has taken pleasure and his people he will beautify the meek with salvation they've the Saints be joyful and glory let them sing a ladder upon their beds that the high praise of God be in their mouth and the two-edged sword in their hand Alleluia this is how we should be now the Word of God is powerful show as quick and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder soul and spirit joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and deeds of the heart so we have a two-inch instilled in our hand write the Word of God this is this is this is what this is what we fight with right the Word of God amen and that word is nigh us faces we have that weapon right it's nice even in my even in our mouth and in our heart so I'm just carrying it physically around here but the word is in here write the words and here will come forth here right and that's how you use this weapon as you've got to speak it you've got to speak to your enemy you take the promise of God amen and speak it forth and faith hallelujah that's why this is a time of no more silence I guess my time when the bride is speaking hallelujah now the people and and I'll just finish with this there's a veil you got to see the effect of carrying the word right the Levites the Levites were instructed to carry the word when Israel went into the Promised Land and they carried the ark into the Jordan and it opened the Jordan that the people could cross her into their inheritance right so it actually cradled away where people could cross her death because Jordan represents death people died themselves they crossed Jordan there's actually it's by the Word of God in Christ an entrance where people can go to the new land become one with Christ Jesus right so this is the word you carry this is your weapon this is what it does it's not just the ministry we are not a Catholic group where it's all the priests and it's not the people that's what is in all of us why we're called to use our weapon right not just a few of us that use it all of us are called to use it wholly all of us II I called to hold the word then death then awaking come open an atmosphere can be created God can come down and meet people hallelujah so the priests they took that Ark and they crossed Jordan and he says if you put brother Graham says if you put God first the AH Queen first if you put the word first amen you're bound to come out right hallelujah you're bound to come out right now they also so this isn't trying to guide a service without a being as will he says watch the Ark and the Bible always is the type of the word to us because it was the Word of God in the Ark now notice the Ark what they brought up look how they did it it was not put in its original god-ordained position this is David taking it on account right now God see it back there in the law how it must be done but this Ark must be how it must be moved and who it must be moved by but David under his anointing my brother don't you miss this my sister's you who want to be woman preachers so forth don't miss this no matter how much your anointing is you've got to put you've got to get in God's provided position David's anointing was alright but I'm doing it he got enthused and stepped over the boundary line what did he do he stepped over the boundary line and said of putting the ark in its original position he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the Levites it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the Levites which is over the heart the word is not in the mind it's in the heart not on a new cat what was it represented something new David did there spoke of every denomination therefore be God's Word is not to be carried by state prep precipitous or bishops and so forth or denomination it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the heart of man and not in some ecclesiastical move the Holy Spirit is a treasure of God's love and the heart of men and woman to obey see was on the show his ministers his ministers was the levites put it over the left shoulder and they picked the act like that because it was over their heart they had the burden of the word on their heart he says amen he said well I'm not a minister but we're called to carry the word right a mother is a minister to her children you are the fifth gospel right so you're a minister a husband as the priest of the home right and so now if the word is carried right it will produce life so he's finished with these two points so you read what the acted and the Old Testament is carried by the Levites when they cross it opened away and I mean whether there's just a shadow the reality is far greater it opened a way for the people of Israel to cross the Red Sea and they came in during the harvest season season Joshua so it opened a way that the people could go in and possess their inheritance rights in the wood carried today opens a way for all those who are willing to die to themselves to cross through and it also was carried around Jericho and it was carried around Jericho and that caused the wolves to fall down flat that Rahab could be freed hallelujah so now we carry a word right oh this thing will be better we carry a word they carried the word around Jericho and by them carrying the word Rahab his old life was destroyed right she was no longer a prisoner in that city of a world that was going to fall apart she was free she was free now to become one with Salman to become part of the promise
