[27:37] amen
[27:39] I see brother my name is back
[27:42] God bless you
[27:47] I think my dad will know that if there's
[27:49] anybody that can fall asleep in the
[27:50] service tonight his brother born there
[27:54] you're gonna have to fight you're gonna
[27:56] have to fight all the way eh
[27:58] amen God bless you Saints
[28:02] we have my sermon title for tonight and
[28:05] I'm just going to say it out from the
[28:06] beginning is life of a Believer a true
[28:08] Witness
[28:09] so I believe with all my heart that each
[28:12] one of you there's no mistakes with God
[28:15] amen each one of you has been placed
[28:17] here and you've been placed here for a
[28:19] reason and hopefully as we go through
[28:21] the Book of Daniel tonight we can show
[28:22] you that that there comes a time where
[28:25] you're going to have to stand for what
[28:27] you believe in
[28:28] the pressure will come on and you're
[28:31] going to have to stand and if there's
[28:33] anything to stand for in this day and
[28:35] age in this church age is this message
[28:38] of the hour
[28:40] because nowhere has there been a time
[28:42] like this
[28:44] the fire is hot
[28:46] oh man the the the the the the arguments
[28:49] is all over the show the voices are
[28:51] everywhere no time like now to stand
[28:56] and with all you can stand
[28:59] amen so let us go to our opening
[29:01] scripture
[29:02] and we're going to go there to the Book
[29:04] of Matthew and we go to Matthew 10.
[29:08] and I've got it up there
[29:11] Matthew 10.
[29:13] amen you pray for me this is the nearest
[29:16] I've ever been in my life
[29:19] standing here in the front but it's a
[29:20] good place to be because that means the
[29:21] Lord can do the work and I can relax
[29:24] amen
[29:26] so when we go to Matthew 10 I want you
[29:28] to think about this is if you're a
[29:30] witness there's going to always be a
[29:33] taste
[29:34] are you going to taste what you believe
[29:35] in amen
[29:38] and with that test
[29:40] is going to come a testimony
[29:42] so as long as we can stay with those
[29:44] lines tonight we will all arrive at the
[29:46] end I pray in the name of our Lord Jesus
[29:49] Christ so
[29:50] he says and ye shall be bought before
[29:52] Governors and Kings for my sake for a
[29:55] testimony against them and the Gentiles
[29:58] but when they deliver you up take no
[30:01] thought how or what ye shall speak
[30:04] for it shall be given unto thee or unto
[30:07] you in the same hour
[30:09] what ye shall speak
[30:12] for it is not ye that speak
[30:15] but the spirit of your father which
[30:17] speaketh in you
[30:20] may the Lord bless the reading of the
[30:22] word you may have your seats
[30:24] amen
[30:28] let's turn our Bibles to Malachi 4.
[30:35] so there comes a time where a prophet
[30:38] comes on the scene and God sends a word
[30:41] now before judgment God always has sent
[30:44] a prophet always he will not change his
[30:47] word it will be no other way that is how
[30:49] God does it that's how God runs his
[30:50] business we all believe it amen but see
[30:53] this Prophet was sent for you
[30:56] this message was sent for a reason
[30:58] because when we look at at the when the
[31:01] prophet came on the scene there was a
[31:03] lot of things that was going on a lot of
[31:05] confusion a lot of trains that came in a
[31:08] rock and roll music came in a lot of
[31:10] things hit the world very quickly and
[31:13] God said hold on
[31:15] hold on this is not what I built this is
[31:17] not what I want
[31:19] so then he'll give man a choice to
[31:21] follow what he wants or to follow the
[31:23] full word of God the restored word of
[31:26] God Amen and no I didn't come to have
[31:29] any arguments or fights so just just sit
[31:32] and relax because God will interpret his
[31:35] own word amen
[31:38] so he comes in he says we started verse
[31:40] 2 and he says but unto you that fear my
[31:43] name shall the son of righteousness
[31:45] arise with healing in his wings and he
[31:48] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[31:50] the stall and ye shall treat down the
[31:53] wicked and shall be ashes under the
[31:55] soles of your feet in the day that I
[31:57] shall do this saith the Lord of hosts
[31:59] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[32:01] which I commanded unto him and Horeb
[32:04] and for all Israel with my statutes and
[32:07] judgments behold I will send you Elijah
[32:10] the prophet before the coming of the
[32:12] great and grateful day of the Lord now
[32:14] we know that that day hasn't happened
[32:16] yet because we're all still here amen so
[32:20] there is a scripture there is a and
[32:22] we'll finish verse 6 now but there's a
[32:24] scripture that was written under
[32:26] inspiration from a prophet and that's
[32:29] now locked into the Bible it's sitting
[32:31] right there
[32:32] but somebody has to fulfill that
[32:35] scripture because God cannot say
[32:37] something and it returns to him void he
[32:41] cannot he cannot say by my stripes
[32:43] you're healed and there's nobody that
[32:45] receives healing he can't say I didn't
[32:47] for I finished it all I died for all sin
[32:50] and nobody can accept the blood and all
[32:52] sin is strict enough he he won't say
[32:55] that and not keep it when he said let
[32:57] there be light what happened there was
[33:00] light when he formed man and he said it
[33:03] was good it was good okay so what God
[33:06] says will come back so God cannot go
[33:09] into the word and put a scripture there
[33:11] for a people and there's no people to
[33:14] fulfill that scripture so on that basis
[33:17] we're going to dive in the Book of
[33:19] Daniel and prove how they were
[33:20] scriptures in the book of Elijah already
[33:22] that was proving that Daniel and his
[33:25] friends was going to stand upon this
[33:27] Earth
[33:28] okay and I'll show you hopefully the
[33:30] Lord will just show it to you tonight
[33:31] but you will always reap what you sow
[33:34] and God's word will always return to him
[33:37] but not void
[33:39] amen so God Don't Make Mistakes you're
[33:42] not a mistake you were here for a reason
[33:43] and God already saw you here because why
[33:46] he placed you here is he needed lures he
[33:49] needed if he is a great fisherman which
[33:51] I know he is because he can catch all of
[33:53] us he caught me okay as much as I was
[33:56] swimming around he knew what lure to use
[33:59] brother Andy's food was one of them but
[34:01] he knew what lure to use or put on my
[34:04] way so that he could catch me so
[34:06] regardless and what I believed and how I
[34:09] was running there was a Brother Andy and
[34:11] his sister Bronwyn upon this Earth okay
[34:13] that he had to use to get my attention
[34:16] Okay so as much as they don't maybe want
[34:19] it to be in the seventh church and I
[34:20] know brother Andy wants to be here
[34:22] because the most exciting time and maybe
[34:23] he wanted to be back in the book of Acts
[34:25] which we are still in by the way he
[34:27] wanted to be in that age or maybe still
[34:28] fought with a sword and do all those
[34:30] things God said I want Andy Clifford in
[34:33] this church for our monster
[34:36] praise the Lord that that's what you
[34:39] were so just accept it you're here for a
[34:41] reason God didn't make a mistake so
[34:43] young kids if you feel like you don't
[34:45] belong here I've got news for you it is
[34:48] scripted the whole thing is rigged
[34:50] you're here for a reason amen so as much
[34:53] as you might think it's not that it is
[34:56] that because God Don't Make Mistakes
[34:58] amen and guess what you are going to
[35:02] stand for a testimony for this word
[35:05] I know I didn't say you may be stand for
[35:08] it I want you to listen what I said you
[35:10] will stand because if God placed you
[35:13] yeah he said whatever happens to you I
[35:16] will make sure your words won't fall to
[35:18] the ground but just stand on my word
[35:20] I'll take care of the rest now young
[35:23] Sunday school of last Sunday can I
[35:25] please stand up my class stand up
[35:29] what did we preach in the Sunday School
[35:32] Joshua
[35:33] in the morning can you remember
[35:35] what did we talk about I know you take
[35:37] notes very clearly
[35:41] come on Rebecca what did we say
[35:48] who remember that sword
[35:50] amen
[35:52] okay and what did Brother Ben coven do
[35:54] when he came up to the pulpit he stole
[35:56] us on Sunday school lesson amen okay he
[35:59] took our Sunday school lesson and he
[36:01] opened it up now brother Ben have I
[36:03] spoken to you before the service you can
[36:06] never see children
[36:08] so you can never see Davey or do you
[36:10] wanna do you how long could you hold the
[36:11] sword up
[36:14] 20 seconds this man was shaking man Josh
[36:16] was he was going for it as I was reading
[36:18] the old scripture he was just holding on
[36:20] because I said in your strength you
[36:22] can't do it and Brother Andy was
[36:24] preaching the anointing of God and
[36:26] already at my Sunday school lesson so it
[36:28] just dovetailed that when the anointing
[36:30] of God comes that's where miracles
[36:32] happen that's where one guy can turn
[36:34] around and go fight the Philistine Army
[36:36] and everybody walks away and go oh he's
[36:37] still fighting okay let's go back let's
[36:39] go fight again because he could stand
[36:41] because the anointing of God took over
[36:43] and he was fighting the enemy or getting
[36:45] off my notes but so God got your
[36:47] attention
[36:48] because there was something that was in
[36:51] the Sunday school and it happens time
[36:52] and again and you walk into the church
[36:54] and God says but we're not finished yet
[36:56] I'm going to open it up more but that's
[36:58] God
[36:59] that's not an accident it's not planned
[37:02] we don't plan our song Services we don't
[37:04] plan our our service for the week and
[37:06] our Bible studies for the week we let
[37:08] God do the work because God is more than
[37:11] able to do the work amen
[37:14] so let's go to the book of Isaiah 43 and
[37:17] we're going to go to verse 1.
[37:19] so another scripture that I thought I
[37:21] would just share while we go there you
[37:22] you go back there
[37:24] is first Thessalonians 4 who knows the
[37:27] scripture
[37:28] this is your promise this is this is the
[37:31] other part that's written about you
[37:32] because you still see it you know I will
[37:34] send you Elijah the message and you'll
[37:36] hear the voice of the seventh angel okay
[37:38] when his voice starts sound you know the
[37:40] time is at end but this one is for we
[37:42] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[37:44] okay even them that which are asleep
[37:47] Jesus will Jesus will God or sleep in
[37:51] Jesus will God bring with him for we say
[37:54] unto you that by the word of the Lord
[37:56] they that which are alive and remain
[37:59] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[38:02] prevent them which are asleep for the
[38:04] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[38:06] with a shout and with a voice and with
[38:08] the Archangel and with the trumpet of
[38:11] God and the date in Christ shall rise
[38:13] first and they and we which are alive
[38:17] and remain shall be caught up together
[38:18] with him in the clouds to meet the Lord
[38:21] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[38:25] the Lord
[38:27] amen so somebody has fulfilled the
[38:30] scripture this this cannot be written
[38:32] and no manifestation of the word of God
[38:35] is taking place it cannot lie there and
[38:38] nothing happens with this God can't come
[38:40] back and take no one up with him because
[38:41] God said it
[38:43] it is done it is said
[38:46] so there is a people upon this Earth
[38:47] that's going to take a Rapture and I
[38:50] believe I'm looking at them because why
[38:52] are we here
[38:53] to fulfill the word amen predestination
[38:57] is a beautiful thing it means it's all
[38:59] rigged
[39:01] it means that God said it's going to be
[39:03] so and we live out God's plan
[39:06] okay we don't I don't want to go into
[39:08] premises permissive wool and the perfect
[39:10] world and those I don't want to go
[39:12] doctrines or anything deep I just want
[39:14] to say if God said you're going to make
[39:16] it you're going to make it
[39:18] amen that's final okay if he says you're
[39:21] bride you're bright just believe it
[39:24] don't fight it
[39:26] amen
[39:27] so get back on subject
[39:30] if we look here at the book of Isaiah
[39:34] um yeah as I I just want to go there
[39:37] I just lost my plate
[39:39] here we go 43 and we go to verse one
[39:42] okay now look here look at what it says
[39:44] here he says but now thus save the Lord
[39:47] that created the O Jacob and it formed
[39:49] the O Israel fear not for I have
[39:51] redeemed thee who is redeemed
[39:54] amen so your spiritual Israel just
[39:56] remember that okay God didn't stop with
[39:59] the Jews he blinded them came back to
[40:01] you gave you salvation he's going to go
[40:03] back to the Jews he doesn't do anything
[40:04] half he finishes his work he says I have
[40:07] called thee by name have you been called
[40:10] by name
[40:12] then he's talking to you he's trying to
[40:13] get your attention here okay he says
[40:16] Thou Art
[40:18] mine amen done finished he said it it's
[40:22] complete
[40:23] when thou pass through the waters I will
[40:26] be with thee
[40:27] and and through the rivers and they
[40:31] shall not overflow thee when they'll
[40:33] walk us through the fire thou shall not
[40:35] be burned neither shall the fame Kindle
[40:38] upon thee
[40:39] now we're going to go to the Book of
[40:41] Daniel Amen
[40:43] and this is where I think
[40:45] I think see now God has has placed this
[40:49] and and we know that the book of Isaiah
[40:51] is pretty much the Bible
[40:52] and it's all just summed up but this was
[40:54] now a prophecy that gone forth you know
[40:56] this was written out of the heart of God
[40:58] and the prophet penciled it down and he
[41:01] says that I called thee by name and thou
[41:03] art mine so he's got now a expected end
[41:06] for these sentences and these sentences
[41:09] says that nothing nothing that will come
[41:12] to you will hurt you I will be there for
[41:15] you and he says further in verse 3 says
[41:17] for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One
[41:19] of Israel thy savior I am I gave Egypt
[41:23] for thy Ransom Ethiopia and seba for
[41:25] thee so I am the Lord thy God I'm gonna
[41:28] make it this is my work this is not your
[41:30] work this is my work hands off okay
[41:33] don't even try so I want to ask two
[41:35] questions
[41:36] who made the promise
[41:39] and what was the promise
[41:42] so we have to realize When God Says by
[41:45] my stripes you are healed who made the
[41:47] god the promise
[41:49] and whose Stripes were in
[41:52] so all I'm asking
[41:54] if he says that I've died for your sin
[41:56] the iniquity was all on me I took it I
[42:00] went for the cross I took your sins it
[42:03] is Forgiven you've never done it in the
[42:04] first place who made the promise who
[42:07] kept the promise
[42:08] so when we look at the promises of God
[42:10] we shouldn't look at us as we have to
[42:13] obtain to it it's there you just have to
[42:16] believe it and accept it that's faith
[42:18] faith don't need to work it out Faith
[42:21] accepts it believes it confesses it and
[42:24] receives it that's how it works
[42:26] amen so they was Believers Moses I
[42:30] wonder if the young children before they
[42:31] try to fall asleep tonight give me some
[42:33] Believers that had a testimony
[42:36] Joseph another one
[42:38] Daniel
[42:41] to kill one
[42:43] is Jonah
[42:45] Elijah
[42:49] Noah Reuben
[42:51] Paul
[42:53] Joshua
[42:54] Joshua amen
[42:58] yes Debbie
[42:59] David another one
[43:02] Enoch okay amen and Esther and Rahab and
[43:07] all those those preachers and Daniel who
[43:09] who's yours Daniel
[43:11] Daniel
[43:14] that's Daniel Amen yes
[43:18] and what's your name Jonah
[43:20] yeah amen okay so I just want to say I
[43:23] want to keep it like don't get too
[43:25] too tired on me relax okay
[43:30] so here's the Believers
[43:32] and these Believers all of them
[43:35] came to a point where God had to come on
[43:37] the scene and God had to reveal his word
[43:39] through them they did not know they were
[43:41] living out the part of the scripture
[43:43] they were Everyday People Like Us
[43:45] and the prophecies was written and and
[43:48] the scriptures was they Mary knew she
[43:50] was the Virgin that she when she was
[43:52] born did she know she was going to have
[43:54] Jesus
[43:55] no
[43:57] but when it came to us she accepted it
[43:59] she accepted that report it's not hard
[44:02] you don't need to have seven steps to be
[44:04] in heaven you don't need to be you don't
[44:06] need to work it up in here you just have
[44:09] to have it in here if it says it's for
[44:11] you it's you amen he said amen take it
[44:14] okay every believer
[44:16] so here we go to Daniel 1 and let's open
[44:19] our Bible say at Daniel 1 because we're
[44:21] going to go through Daniel 1 2 and 3
[44:22] quickly and I just want to explain to
[44:24] you that this is you
[44:27] this is you and we're going to go there
[44:29] and so we know that now it's Babylon and
[44:32] we've got and I'm going to paraphrase a
[44:33] little bit and then I'm going to go into
[44:34] the scripture and then I'm going to tell
[44:36] you the story I also will be here all
[44:37] night and I don't think you want to be
[44:39] here all night amen so we know
[44:41] Nebuchadnezzar is now the king
[44:43] and and he is now um
[44:46] he is now busy there and and
[44:49] um he's got he's got a plan he says okay
[44:51] I want all the young men in the kingdom
[44:54] and he says there in verse 4 he says the
[44:56] children and who was no blemish well
[44:58] favored and skillful and wisdom cunning
[45:01] and knowledge and understanding and
[45:03] Science and such had ability to them
[45:04] that would stand in the king's Palace
[45:06] okay and to whom them that might teach
[45:09] the learning of the tongue of the
[45:11] Chaldeans so he's got a plan that he's
[45:14] going to get some cool princess that's
[45:15] got some real smarts they're gonna
[45:17] that's gonna further his kingdom because
[45:19] remember he was already he was the king
[45:21] of Babylon he had a lot okay but so he
[45:24] knew he had to get wise men to help him
[45:26] run the kingdom
[45:27] so now here comes here comes a pinch
[45:30] Point here comes a a a a challenge he
[45:33] says and the King appointed him a daily
[45:35] provision of the king's meat and of the
[45:38] wine which they drank so nourishing
[45:41] um them for three years that at the end
[45:44] of they might stand before the king
[45:46] so the King's Way of preparing these
[45:48] young men is feed them give them wine
[45:51] teach them everything and they'll be
[45:53] wise
[45:55] but it didn't sit much right with Daniel
[45:58] go see Daniel knew that this is not for
[46:01] him in his heart God started working
[46:03] within him and if we read on it says now
[46:05] among these were the children was
[46:07] um was the children of Judah Daniel
[46:10] hananiah Michelle and Azariah
[46:14] okay and in it says in verse 8 but
[46:16] Daniel
[46:17] purposed in his heart that he will not
[46:20] defile himself with the portion of the
[46:22] king's meat
[46:25] so he just said whoa something is not
[46:27] right here I I I'm different
[46:30] but see there was nothing written that
[46:33] made him different he just said I don't
[46:35] wonder I don't want to be fed like those
[46:36] people something inside here is busy
[46:39] talking to me saying Daniel this is not
[46:40] your portion I don't want this for you
[46:43] he had to listen to that voice he had to
[46:45] he had to trust what was being revealed
[46:48] he had to know when he looked at it and
[46:50] he saw what all the other kings were and
[46:52] and the princes were and they were
[46:54] drinking wine and they were having an
[46:55] awesome time and and they were watching
[46:57] these Sports and they were doing their
[46:59] worldly things and they wore whatever
[47:01] they could war and say whatever they
[47:04] could say and and then it's blogging
[47:06] this and vlogging that and they can do
[47:07] all those things
[47:08] but he looked at them and he goes I'm
[47:11] different
[47:12] something inside this I'm different this
[47:14] is not for me
[47:16] and that's the still Small Voice that
[47:18] God has for every believer to say you
[47:19] don't belong here this is not for you
[47:22] and as much as you like to drown at that
[47:24] voice I'm telling you now God will come
[47:26] back and say this is not for you
[47:30] and you can fight that voice but it just
[47:33] doesn't sit right in here and it's
[47:35] rubbing and it's rubbing and you're like
[47:37] Lord you you're dealing but see
[47:40] somewhere you're gonna get tested
[47:43] the challenge is going to come and here
[47:46] it comes and it says this is a portion
[47:48] of the meat and then um in verse 8 it
[47:51] says not the wine which he drank and
[47:54] therefore he requested of the prince of
[47:56] the eunuchs that he might not defile
[47:59] himself
[48:00] now this is a big thing
[48:02] because the eunuch has been placed over
[48:04] them
[48:05] and the eunuch's job is
[48:07] thus Save the King
[48:09] the king says do it you do it so his
[48:12] head is on the table if he gets it wrong
[48:16] and Daniel Dean goes to him and he says
[48:18] now God had brought Daniel into favor
[48:21] and tender love with the prince of the
[48:24] eunuchs see God works on both ways
[48:27] Daniel had the feeling and he knew
[48:29] something was was not right and he had
[48:32] the confidence to go to the eunuch okay
[48:34] but God was already dealing with the
[48:37] eunuch to know that man this guy is
[48:38] different I like him okay and he's going
[48:41] to come with some weird request okay
[48:44] seriously pulse men okay he's gonna ask
[48:49] me something weird he doesn't want to
[48:50] eat meat he doesn't want to drink the
[48:52] finest wine he doesn't want to eat like
[48:54] the rest of them he wants pulse
[48:57] and then it's going to look better and
[49:00] fatter and healthier than the rest of
[49:02] these guys
[49:06] because remember logic defines us that
[49:08] once he goes on that diet it there's no
[49:11] sustenance that's going to keep him
[49:12] there but see Daniel said that's what I
[49:15] want and I'm now going on with the story
[49:16] because I don't want to spend time on
[49:18] this too much but it says
[49:20] that now the test in verse 12 come and
[49:23] he says prove thy servant I beseech thee
[49:25] 10 days and let them give us posts to
[49:29] eat and to drink water
[49:32] now I like no I don't like water
[49:34] [Laughter]
[49:36] okay
[49:37] but if you think the diet that they went
[49:39] on this is lean
[49:41] and then he says then let our
[49:44] countenance be looked upon before thee
[49:46] and thy countenance of the children that
[49:48] eat of the portion of the king's meat
[49:50] and as thou seeest deal with our
[49:53] servants now that's a bold statement but
[49:56] see Daniel now made a stand for what he
[49:58] believed in he made a stand for what God
[50:01] was doing in his life
[50:03] okay so the taste came and the eunuch
[50:05] says to him he says hey bro if you get
[50:08] this wrong my head is off
[50:11] but you know what
[50:13] go for it I'll taste you 10 days
[50:15] remember 10 days it's coming back
[50:18] and then here in verse 18 to 20. now at
[50:22] the end oh 17 he said and and for these
[50:26] four children God gave them knowledge
[50:28] and skill and learning and wisdom God
[50:30] Daniel that understanding in all visions
[50:33] and dreams so that was the gifts that
[50:34] that God gave Daniel and and the other
[50:37] three of them
[50:38] he says in verse now at the end Verse 18
[50:41] now at the end of the days and the King
[50:43] said to bring them in and to the prince
[50:46] of the eunuchs brought them in before
[50:48] Nebuchadnezzar and the and the king
[50:50] communed with him so commune means he
[50:52] had a he had to and fro with him you
[50:54] know he had a bit of a chat with him hey
[50:55] guys how's it going you know how was the
[50:57] how was your training how was everything
[50:59] awesome a couple of tough questions you
[51:01] know because he wanted to see what was
[51:03] now in them
[51:04] okay and this is his report
[51:07] and among all of all was found none like
[51:09] Daniel hananiah Michelle and Azariah so
[51:13] Cedar of music
[51:15] and therefore they stood before the king
[51:17] and in all matters of wisdom and
[51:20] understanding that the king inquired of
[51:22] them they found them ten times
[51:27] ten times better than them okay then all
[51:31] The Magicians astrologers and and um and
[51:35] um all these in all his realm and Daniel
[51:37] and Daniels continued even into the
[51:40] first year of Iran he continued in the
[51:43] first year of the king Osiris so what
[51:45] happened now is they believed something
[51:48] the test came and because they believed
[51:51] it and they stood for what they believe
[51:52] in God came and he fulfilled that but
[51:55] but what they don't see is this was not
[51:57] and we're going on with with Daniel too
[51:59] this was all God's plan because God
[52:02] wanted to get Nebuchadnezzar's attention
[52:04] Okay but he wanted to put the right
[52:06] people in the right places first so so
[52:08] King Nebuchadnezzar knows nothing was
[52:10] coming up next now the same for you you
[52:13] sit in your work you sit at your school
[52:15] you're surrounded by people you touch
[52:18] people's lives everywhere but God's
[52:20] blessing you in different places
[52:23] and he's saying I just want you to to
[52:25] stand for a testimony I just want you to
[52:28] stand for a witness I you don't need to
[52:30] say much but when the question comes to
[52:32] you stand on the word of God
[52:35] because if you stand on it it will stand
[52:37] for you they might not understand what
[52:39] you say
[52:40] you say Hey you know I believe there's a
[52:43] prophet that see on Earth and he
[52:45] preached and he's opened the seals they
[52:47] might think you're whack it's fine you
[52:49] stay with what you believe
[52:51] because God has to come and confirm it
[52:53] to those people okay so they'll either
[52:55] go for the word or reject the word that
[52:57] is God's will God's get it right this is
[52:59] all God's work just stand for what you
[53:01] believe in
[53:02] don't hide it if you hide it God cannot
[53:06] back you up you're a false witness
[53:09] if you believe it stand for it that is
[53:11] what God gave you he put you here for a
[53:13] reason
[53:15] so then
[53:16] we go to the next one and we go to
[53:18] Daniel 2. now of course
[53:21] Nebuchadnezzar gets this dream now I'm
[53:23] going back in the story now he gets a
[53:25] dream
[53:26] and he goes back to the sorcerers and
[53:28] The Magicians and all those guys and he
[53:29] says I want you to tell me my dream
[53:33] so he doesn't tell them the dream and
[53:35] say interpret it for me he tells them I
[53:37] want you to tell me what I dreamed and I
[53:40] want you to interpret it
[53:42] and and the Chaldean say to him and all
[53:45] the magicians and astrologers they say
[53:47] to him King you're asking a hard thing
[53:50] how could we see what goes on in your
[53:53] heart how can I read the intent and the
[53:56] thought of the heart I don't have that
[53:58] gift Satan cannot do that Satan cannot
[54:02] see what's in your heart he cannot read
[54:05] your thoughts he can give you them he
[54:07] can give you them all day long but he
[54:09] cannot read the intent of your heart
[54:11] only God sees that
[54:13] okay so don't get it wrong so if God
[54:16] comes your way and he starts working
[54:17] with you and it's working within here
[54:19] you know God's getting your attention
[54:22] amen okay so I just wanted to lift that
[54:24] up as well so here Nebuchadnezzar since
[54:27] sees this dream and it troubles him very
[54:29] much but he can't really remember what
[54:31] he dreamed but he knows it impacted him
[54:34] really much
[54:35] so he goes and he puts forth a degree
[54:37] and he says well you you clever man
[54:39] you're musicians your astrologers and
[54:41] Chaldeans are all those guys you can't
[54:43] tell me because you're trying to buy
[54:44] time I'm gonna make a decree
[54:46] I'm going to off with all of your heads
[54:48] because you're a bunch of fakes
[54:52] because they were
[54:54] they had gifts but they were fakes okay
[54:57] so they could say only what the king
[55:00] said and they can turn the word as much
[55:01] as they like and they can go from
[55:03] Revelation and Genesis and tell you all
[55:05] the nice things but they could not put
[55:06] the word together
[55:08] they could not put it together
[55:10] okay I hope you're reading between the
[55:13] lines here
[55:14] okay they had a epiphany of this and a
[55:17] little bit of scripture on this and
[55:18] David had four stones and that one had
[55:20] that and this one and they're all these
[55:21] little things but they don't want to
[55:23] take all of it
[55:25] so when the king says give me all of it
[55:27] I want to know what's in here give me
[55:29] all of it discern my heart deal with me
[55:32] inside where nobody else knows they
[55:35] couldn't do it
[55:37] it's only one that can do it and it's
[55:38] the loving God
[55:39] amen so in in verse 9 he says so I will
[55:43] make known unto me the dream and but
[55:46] therefore as one decree for you and you
[55:48] will be prepared what you have prepared
[55:51] lying and corrupt words to speak before
[55:53] me
[55:54] so he figured them out
[55:56] it's not a dumb King they say
[55:58] he says till the time that I'll be
[56:01] changed thereof and tell me the dream I
[56:03] shall know that ye can show me the
[56:06] interpretation thereof so he's now
[56:08] putting the challenge forth and say show
[56:09] me my dream then give me the
[56:11] interpretation then verse 4 now verse 4
[56:14] is where the challenge comes Daniel he's
[56:17] there they they're having a bit of a
[56:19] evening drinking a coffee and just you
[56:23] know just having a little thought and
[56:25] just being in a nice diamond
[56:27] on his door
[56:29] and they open up and he is this guy and
[56:31] he says sorry we're gonna have to cut
[56:33] off your head
[56:35] King said
[56:36] kids I want you to understand King said
[56:40] I'll come and kill you you wise man
[56:41] because you're a fight
[56:43] okay now I'm paraphrasing a bit but you
[56:44] can go read it read the chapter two okay
[56:46] it's in verse 12 that's what I'm talking
[56:48] about and Daniel goes oh stop you Lori
[56:51] whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on all
[56:53] of a sudden I want to get killed just
[56:55] the other day you know when when we were
[56:58] there by the king and we were so wise
[57:00] and everything he said you guys are the
[57:02] fairest and the wisest and everything I
[57:04] want you to rule my kingdom now I'm
[57:05] going to get killed why and he says and
[57:07] he gets here and he speaks to um ariak I
[57:11] hope that's his name or else man of poor
[57:14] fella Eric tells him about the degrees
[57:15] but what's the degree about he says Nah
[57:18] The King had a dream
[57:19] he had a dream nobody could tell him to
[57:22] dream
[57:23] he goes okay
[57:25] so don't kill anyone now just give me
[57:26] just give me give me a couple of moments
[57:28] I want to go speak to the king
[57:30] now here comes a believer
[57:32] I want you to see this
[57:34] 17 and Daniel went to his oh no sorry
[57:38] I'm 16. he says and Daniel went and he
[57:41] desired of the king that he would give
[57:43] him time and that he would show the king
[57:46] the interpretation
[57:49] now this is bold challenge games fourth
[57:52] believer goes and speaks to the king and
[57:54] says
[57:55] I will show you the interpretation now I
[57:57] want to ask you that Daniel have thus
[58:00] saved the Lord From The Lord no he
[58:02] didn't have it yet
[58:04] he didn't know if God will show him the
[58:06] dream though it was his gifting he had
[58:08] no confirmation that that was going to
[58:10] happen
[58:11] so he stood for what he believed
[58:14] because he knew that the almighty God
[58:16] can answer him and he can show him the
[58:18] dream because he knew in whom he
[58:20] believed so now he goes back to the king
[58:23] and he says to him give me some time I
[58:25] will come back with the interpretation
[58:28] think about it
[58:31] have you spiritual hats on
[58:34] give me time let me go pray
[58:36] I come and sit here Lord show me the
[58:39] interpretation
[58:40] I don't understand the scripture I want
[58:43] to know more about the Revelation I want
[58:46] to know more about why the voice why the
[58:48] shout what's the trumpets about what's
[58:51] the vials about show me more of the
[58:53] Revelation because I know God you can
[58:56] give it to me
[58:57] and if somebody tastes me on it and I
[59:00] have been in my own testimony where
[59:01] people has tested and asked me heavy
[59:03] questions very very cutting questions
[59:06] not just about the prophet and this
[59:08] message but even in my life and I didn't
[59:10] have the answer and I said Lord show me
[59:13] the interpretation but help me stand for
[59:16] me and the very next day coming into
[59:18] church or coming into fellowship and the
[59:20] word comes right over that and those
[59:23] people testify and say didn't we just
[59:25] speak about this yesterday and I said
[59:27] but that's God it's not me he's getting
[59:29] your attention the same year he's going
[59:32] back to the king and he believes and he
[59:34] says I will come and bring the
[59:35] interpretation now he's standing for the
[59:38] word now let the word come and stand for
[59:41] him because remember he's a Believer and
[59:43] he's a witness
[59:45] so he didn't know he was going to get it
[59:47] but he's a Believer and he's a witness
[59:49] amen
[59:51] amen so here we go and we go into
[59:53] verse 17. so what every good Christian
[59:57] does
[59:58] we we organize a prayer meeting
[1:00:01] because this is serious you know because
[1:00:03] my head is is going to be gone so Daniel
[1:00:07] goes back and he goes hey you know
[1:00:09] Bendigo and that time they their names
[1:00:12] was different they said uh Daniel went
[1:00:13] to his house and hananiah Michelle and
[1:00:16] Azariah he said boys we need to pray but
[1:00:20] he says these words he says that they
[1:00:23] would desire mercies of the god of
[1:00:26] Heaven concerning this secret that
[1:00:28] Daniel and his fellows should not perish
[1:00:33] so he didn't say boys you need to pray
[1:00:35] for me I'm going to go before the king
[1:00:36] and I'm going to teach him a lesson and
[1:00:38] I'm going to show him how it's done and
[1:00:39] I'm going to say thus say of the Lord
[1:00:41] and God's just going to reveal it and
[1:00:42] we'll be here either this is his voice
[1:00:44] we're going to die if we don't pray
[1:00:47] I hope you get it you're gonna die if
[1:00:50] you don't pray you will spiritually die
[1:00:52] if you do not talk to God if you do not
[1:00:55] talk to him and you don't ask him to
[1:00:57] help you and you're not there communing
[1:00:59] with the Lord in your secret place you
[1:01:02] will die it's always a case of life and
[1:01:05] death children if you're not praying you
[1:01:08] will die and I'm not saying a physical
[1:01:10] death but inside if you have no
[1:01:12] relationship with God how can God reveal
[1:01:15] to you his word
[1:01:18] same for all of us remember what you
[1:01:21] cast upon the Water
[1:01:23] will return to you
[1:01:26] so if you're not talking to God and you
[1:01:28] don't have you don't have places where
[1:01:30] God needs to deal in your life and you
[1:01:31] say Lord take this take this from me I'm
[1:01:34] tired of this and we don't have a
[1:01:36] communion with God how can God show you
[1:01:38] in his word how can God come up the
[1:01:40] scene how would you even know it's God
[1:01:42] telling you what's going on if you're
[1:01:44] not talking to him
[1:01:45] prayer is the number one weapon you have
[1:01:49] it is uh it is understated I'm telling
[1:01:53] you prayer is where it begins
[1:01:56] if you pray I prayed for my wife when I
[1:01:58] was still in the world when I wasn't
[1:01:59] even a believer
[1:02:02] and God heard my voice
[1:02:05] and it's a testimony and it's part of my
[1:02:07] testimony even being unbeliever not
[1:02:10] really believing in God I came to a time
[1:02:12] where I was desperate and I got on my
[1:02:14] knees and I said Lord I need your help
[1:02:16] here I'm tired and you heard me even
[1:02:19] when I was an unbeliever
[1:02:22] how much not more Believers that
[1:02:25] standing on his word saying God please
[1:02:26] just come behind this word and confirm
[1:02:28] it because I'm out of my depth
[1:02:31] I cannot interpret this dream this is
[1:02:33] only from you I'm going to go to the
[1:02:35] king and if I get it wrong my head is
[1:02:38] gone
[1:02:39] so I think it's time you step in Lord
[1:02:41] please have a conference with him
[1:02:44] amen if I don't understand this I'm not
[1:02:47] just going to self it I'm going to get
[1:02:48] on my knees and I'm going to pray and
[1:02:50] I'm going to pray and I'm going to pray
[1:02:51] until God gives me answer and I will not
[1:02:54] stop praying until I get the answer
[1:02:56] that's a believer
[1:02:58] and that's why Daniel went back to his
[1:03:00] friends to say but I need you to pray
[1:03:02] with me because this is a real matter
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] so year 19 the great secret wasn't
[1:03:09] revealed unto Daniel in a night vision
[1:03:11] then Daniel blessed God Of Heaven
[1:03:15] so God came down gave him the vision and
[1:03:18] now he goes into worship because he
[1:03:20] knows this is God that's speaking he saw
[1:03:22] the vision now he worships God and he's
[1:03:25] praising God and he says here and Daniel
[1:03:27] answered and said blessed be the name of
[1:03:29] the Lord forever for wisdom and might is
[1:03:32] he and he that that changes the times
[1:03:35] and the seasons and removes Kings and
[1:03:37] set them them up he knew what God was
[1:03:40] doing
[1:03:41] he knew what was God able to do and he
[1:03:44] says always he says he giveth wisdom to
[1:03:46] the wise and knowledge to them that have
[1:03:49] understanding
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:53] and he really went into deep worship and
[1:03:56] he thanked God
[1:03:57] and then
[1:03:58] he went back
[1:04:00] so now we went back with thus say of the
[1:04:02] Lord
[1:04:03] but now it needs to be now he's got the
[1:04:06] vision from God but now he is a Believer
[1:04:08] he's now boldly going to speak before a
[1:04:10] king
[1:04:12] and he he knows that that's God and he
[1:04:15] knows that's the dream so the confidence
[1:04:17] when he goes back is not him being
[1:04:19] lifted up but he knows now God is going
[1:04:21] to step on the scene and he's going to
[1:04:23] tell
[1:04:24] um I said brother he's going to tell
[1:04:26] King David neither his dream okay yeah I
[1:04:30] said why too okay so then he goes in 29
[1:04:34] and says in Daniel answered in the
[1:04:37] presence of the king and said
[1:04:39] the secret which the king have the man
[1:04:42] that can cannot the wise man the
[1:04:44] astrologists the musicians the sufsayers
[1:04:47] show unto the king
[1:04:49] but there is a God
[1:04:51] in heaven that reveal of Secrets and
[1:04:54] make it known to King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:04:57] what shall be in the latter days thy
[1:05:00] dream and the visions of thy Head Upon
[1:05:03] thy bed are these
[1:05:05] so now he's saying my God knows what
[1:05:08] goes on in your head
[1:05:12] so so just let's let's get it straight
[1:05:14] my God is so great that whatever you
[1:05:17] think of I know
[1:05:19] children who knows another story in the
[1:05:21] Bible okay there was a prophet and then
[1:05:24] the the Philistines will keep attacking
[1:05:27] attacking and every time they attack
[1:05:28] boom they just run into a wall who is
[1:05:30] that Jonah
[1:05:33] nope
[1:05:34] cowboy
[1:05:37] no Reuben
[1:05:39] nope who knows come on Brothers anyone
[1:05:43] there
[1:05:44] yes
[1:05:46] yes and that King was so troubled of
[1:05:49] course it goes man every time we attack
[1:05:51] boom we just hit it was it the Assyrians
[1:05:53] or was it the Philistines brother be the
[1:05:55] syrians hey okay sorry got the got the
[1:05:57] the oldest enemies so they'll just cut
[1:05:59] them down okay if it's a cancer demon or
[1:06:02] if it's a or if it's a last demon it's
[1:06:04] all just demons as long as you just know
[1:06:06] which one you're fighting cut his head
[1:06:07] off don't don't let him don't don't let
[1:06:09] him stand he's got his hero so and then
[1:06:12] what happens is Elijah leads them back
[1:06:14] into the camp he's blinded leads them
[1:06:16] all into the camp and actually Israel
[1:06:18] could have just stopped it right there
[1:06:21] but they feed them and let them go
[1:06:23] so that's the god that we serve that
[1:06:26] even if your enemies comes to Seek and
[1:06:29] Destroy you he just turns them around
[1:06:30] feeds them well and sends them on their
[1:06:32] way because we don't fight the fight
[1:06:35] I want you to realize we don't fight
[1:06:37] flesh and Bone
[1:06:38] we fight the spirits and we cannot
[1:06:41] defeat them only God can as long as you
[1:06:43] can submit yourself he didn't say are
[1:06:45] you able he says are you available I
[1:06:47] want to use you will you be willing to
[1:06:49] stand for my witness I'm coming on the
[1:06:52] scene amen
[1:06:54] he says um
[1:06:56] and then he says that and then we forgot
[1:06:58] to verse 46 pretty much now the
[1:07:01] revelation of this taste comes because
[1:07:03] God knows the thoughts and intent of the
[1:07:05] heart and he proved it and he said to
[1:07:07] him his dream and bro and and and King
[1:07:09] Nebuchadnezzar he goes and says then the
[1:07:12] king nebuchadne is a fell upon his face
[1:07:14] and worship Daniel
[1:07:17] okay
[1:07:18] and a commander that they should they
[1:07:21] should offer and uh what offer ablation
[1:07:26] and sweet odors unto him
[1:07:29] then King answered unto Daniel and said
[1:07:31] of Truth it is that your God is a god of
[1:07:35] gods and the Lord of kings and a
[1:07:38] revealer of the secrets seeing thou
[1:07:40] couldn't couldn't reveal this secret
[1:07:43] amen so an unbeliever
[1:07:46] sees this something more
[1:07:48] going on in the background
[1:07:51] So Daniel 3 let's go I'm about to close
[1:07:54] don't don't fall asleep now it gets
[1:07:56] better
[1:07:57] so now King Nebuchadnezzar is so in in
[1:08:00] enthused with this awesome dream he
[1:08:03] builds a statue
[1:08:04] man this King can get it wrong he knows
[1:08:07] God is God okay how about just think
[1:08:09] about it he knows God is God he sees God
[1:08:11] proves him from from where he chose the
[1:08:14] Daniel and his friends to where he shows
[1:08:16] him the dream he knows that there is
[1:08:18] more Daniel's God is God and he builds a
[1:08:22] statue
[1:08:24] how many of us know that this God that
[1:08:27] we serve is God and then we run after
[1:08:29] other statues
[1:08:34] um look God is Sovereign almighty God
[1:08:38] and we choose to waste our time on other
[1:08:40] statues
[1:08:42] and we look at King Nebuchadnezzar we
[1:08:44] think man this guy must be nuts man
[1:08:47] number serious because look at him he he
[1:08:50] no he sees God interpret his dream he
[1:08:52] knows there's a God that can tell these
[1:08:54] thought and intense of heart he listens
[1:08:55] to every brother Branham service and
[1:08:57] when it comes to the prayer line he says
[1:08:59] sister you have this brother you have
[1:09:01] this he discerns the thought in their
[1:09:03] hearts not brother Branham God coming
[1:09:05] down
[1:09:06] and then they still say days of Miracles
[1:09:08] are over
[1:09:11] that that's a bit fanatical
[1:09:13] I'm telling you if somebody can tell me
[1:09:15] what I'm thinking of
[1:09:17] and he can tell me what's wrong with me
[1:09:18] and then he says you can accept your
[1:09:20] healing and walk off I think it's worth
[1:09:23] listening to him
[1:09:25] because it's not the man it's the God
[1:09:28] because it stands at the
[1:09:30] theater at that I'm waiting for him to
[1:09:32] come not one sermon I ever listened to
[1:09:34] we brought them brother said I will heal
[1:09:37] you
[1:09:38] not one
[1:09:41] so I stand for this message because you
[1:09:43] know what this message opened my eyes to
[1:09:46] what God can do and will do and is doing
[1:09:50] it made him a present God it didn't make
[1:09:52] him a fluffy Duffy God that is that is
[1:09:55] oh he forgives all sin and when I come
[1:09:57] and really have something I need to ask
[1:09:58] him I have to beg and beg and beg I just
[1:10:02] stand in front of him and say Lord your
[1:10:03] word says
[1:10:05] I don't know how you're gonna do it Lord
[1:10:07] but I know you're going to do it amen
[1:10:09] and then when I listen to the prayer
[1:10:11] line something in me says this is deity
[1:10:14] stepping forth every prayer line he
[1:10:17] stops people the ladies walking at us
[1:10:19] his lady stop stop this you turn around
[1:10:22] raise your hand you've got a Gorder
[1:10:23] you've got a Gorder and it is it has
[1:10:26] been bothering you for four years I'll
[1:10:27] get your name okay Lord and He Speaks
[1:10:30] their name
[1:10:31] what is that man
[1:10:34] in all the hundreds and hundreds of
[1:10:36] people that's standing before him he
[1:10:38] speaks their name so God calls you by
[1:10:41] name
[1:10:42] and you are his
[1:10:45] so when he gets you attention don't look
[1:10:47] at all the other things just see what's
[1:10:49] going on stop don't overthink it say are
[1:10:53] you calling me is this for me Lord
[1:10:57] amen
[1:10:59] So Daniel 3 statue is both
[1:11:02] here comes another decree man this King
[1:11:04] loved making the trees hey
[1:11:07] he did he says in verse 4 he says then a
[1:11:12] Herald Cried Out Loud okay so we bought
[1:11:14] the statue and he says this
[1:11:16] um
[1:11:17] uh to you that is commanded o people
[1:11:19] Nations and languages that that at what
[1:11:23] time you would hear the sound of the
[1:11:25] coronate flute harp sekmath sultry um
[1:11:28] delsymon all kinds of music you shall
[1:11:31] fall down and worship the golden image
[1:11:33] that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up
[1:11:36] and who faileth not fall if not down and
[1:11:39] worship it shall in the same hour be
[1:11:42] cast into the midst of the burning fiery
[1:11:44] furnace
[1:11:46] so the challenge is set again
[1:11:48] okay
[1:11:50] days of Miracles are passed he can't
[1:11:52] heal me
[1:11:54] couldn't do it for you and he couldn't
[1:11:55] do it for you and you and you and what's
[1:11:57] the hold on
[1:12:00] God then say I'll heal everyone
[1:12:02] you said I'm your healer
[1:12:05] okay just remember God is Sovereign he
[1:12:07] chooses to do what he chooses to do you
[1:12:10] just remember you can claim it and you
[1:12:13] can believe it and you can speak it and
[1:12:15] you can receive it but God is still
[1:12:17] Sovereign and he still does what God
[1:12:19] does
[1:12:20] they must be a witness upon this Earth
[1:12:22] they must be a witness they cannot not
[1:12:25] be a witness upon this Earth that stands
[1:12:27] for God in the good times and in the bad
[1:12:30] times and if we say what is the good
[1:12:32] times what is your good times and if I
[1:12:35] ask you what is your bad times what is
[1:12:38] your bedtime
[1:12:41] how bad can you go
[1:12:44] because you say you love him
[1:12:47] but now you're in the valley
[1:12:49] and it's deep in there and it's dark in
[1:12:51] there but you know what that's where the
[1:12:54] fruit all ground is
[1:12:55] so as long as you get on your knees you
[1:12:57] start praying that's where the trees are
[1:13:00] planted by the rivers of life because
[1:13:02] when I look in a very Valley I see
[1:13:04] Rivers when I see a river I see life
[1:13:07] where I see life I know I want to be by
[1:13:09] that River because I know even if it's
[1:13:12] dark and even if it's cold and even if
[1:13:14] it's muggy and even if it's painful I am
[1:13:16] planted By the Waters and they will feed
[1:13:18] me and my leaves shall grow and I will
[1:13:20] go green and I will bear fruit and those
[1:13:23] fruit will be my fruit that will honor
[1:13:25] my living God I'll stay in the valley if
[1:13:27] I need to As Long As I grow
[1:13:30] no point being on a Hilltop and you just
[1:13:33] get blown away with the asses
[1:13:35] don't be there rather be in the valley
[1:13:38] you're closer to your God when you're in
[1:13:40] the valley
[1:13:42] he says now of course
[1:13:45] you get those backbiting unbelieving
[1:13:47] people
[1:13:49] that throws blame in verse 9. and they
[1:13:51] speak to the king and they said
[1:13:53] Nebuchadnezzar O King live forever they
[1:13:55] always come with this nice language you
[1:13:56] know oh you great king
[1:13:58] you know
[1:14:00] you made this beautiful degree
[1:14:02] by these Jews
[1:14:05] I didn't see them bow
[1:14:09] they don't dress like us they don't look
[1:14:10] like us they don't believe what we
[1:14:12] believe they they say funny things you
[1:14:16] know they're just different they're
[1:14:17] weird people and if you tell them hey do
[1:14:19] you want to be here they go no
[1:14:22] so oh do you want to go into this
[1:14:23] Nightclub not for me
[1:14:26] brother
[1:14:27] um said it's so beautiful my feet will
[1:14:30] not let me go there
[1:14:32] do you want to go to nightclubs my feet
[1:14:35] don't go there I'm different
[1:14:37] yeah but everybody else
[1:14:40] does so you're just a
[1:14:42] stop cast who wants you
[1:14:43] because you don't want to do what we
[1:14:45] want to do you know I don't want to be
[1:14:46] afraid
[1:14:48] you know and then they go to the coolest
[1:14:49] kids in the school and they go oh you
[1:14:50] see that Reuben yeah every time we say
[1:14:52] yes to do this oh he goes the other way
[1:14:55] but he's living a life he's living a
[1:14:57] witness he's he's doing something that
[1:15:00] not being done on this church age he's
[1:15:03] standing where people are falling
[1:15:06] I would say this far he's overcoming
[1:15:09] where others can't overcome
[1:15:11] because there's a God within him that's
[1:15:13] going to show that he is predestinated
[1:15:15] all of them that belief will overcome
[1:15:20] you have to overcome God said you're
[1:15:23] going to overcome but you see we we
[1:15:25] think of all the the ways not to
[1:15:28] overcome we think of all the things and
[1:15:29] keeps us off the promises we don't think
[1:15:31] on the Promises Satan will never bring
[1:15:33] you back to a promise of God
[1:15:36] he will never bring you back to a
[1:15:38] promise of God you and your house shall
[1:15:39] be saved he will not bring you back
[1:15:41] there he'll take you everywhere else
[1:15:43] he'll show you how filthy your kids is
[1:15:46] he'll show you how wrong your husband is
[1:15:47] he'll show you how bad you are at work
[1:15:50] he'll show you that this one's not for
[1:15:51] you and that one is not for you but when
[1:15:53] it comes to the promises of God he goes
[1:15:58] that's how he deals these guys
[1:16:01] they went to the king and they showed
[1:16:03] all the obvious
[1:16:07] great king Off With Their Heads throwing
[1:16:10] them on the fire they're not bowing to
[1:16:11] your prison
[1:16:12] we're not here to Bow under the pressure
[1:16:15] of this age
[1:16:18] we are not leducian we are not increased
[1:16:21] with Goods we are not blind we are not
[1:16:23] miserable we are not
[1:16:26] naked
[1:16:29] we are different
[1:16:31] and that is my witness and that is my
[1:16:33] testimony and re you know what I don't
[1:16:35] care if I'm Different I like myself this
[1:16:38] way I love what God is doing in my life
[1:16:40] I can see him everywhere I walk I can
[1:16:43] drive down the road I can see him I can
[1:16:45] walk into a in a library where it's so
[1:16:48] boring and I can find God there
[1:16:51] I can sit under a tree and a leaf can
[1:16:54] fall and I can see job's story
[1:16:56] hey
[1:16:58] my phone man he was looking at the trees
[1:17:00] and he saw but that tree dies
[1:17:02] in its back where am I going
[1:17:06] see you can see him everywhere but what
[1:17:08] we choose to do is we keep our Focus off
[1:17:10] him
[1:17:11] and then we forget what we are
[1:17:14] and I'm saying again we forget what we
[1:17:16] are
[1:17:17] we are the true witness to a dying age
[1:17:21] that is under judgment
[1:17:23] and if you watch the news she's under
[1:17:26] judgment
[1:17:28] not coming back
[1:17:30] and I'm not staying here
[1:17:33] he says then he calls them forward to
[1:17:35] make example of them and now the king
[1:17:37] great King Nebuchadnezzar say come here
[1:17:40] come here boys
[1:17:42] very wise very nice got a problem
[1:17:45] why didn't you bow
[1:17:49] you know that you didn't bow I'm
[1:17:51] actually going to have to throw you in
[1:17:52] the fire now but this is one thing he
[1:17:54] did wrong and I want to go into that
[1:17:57] verse verse 14 to 15.
[1:18:04] and I'm going to read verse 14.
[1:18:06] Nebuchadnezzar speak to them and said
[1:18:07] unto them it is true o Cedric misak now
[1:18:10] he calls them by the Babylonian names
[1:18:12] and Bendigo
[1:18:15] do ye serve my God nor worship the
[1:18:18] golden image where I have set up
[1:18:21] now I've already that now you know yeah
[1:18:23] you be ready so now he instructs him
[1:18:25] that when you hear the sound of the
[1:18:27] cornered fluid hopsack but Salisbury and
[1:18:29] dulcimer that all Kings and all kinds of
[1:18:32] music that you will you will ye shall
[1:18:34] fall down and worship this image which I
[1:18:37] have made
[1:18:38] but if you worship not ye shall be cast
[1:18:41] the same hour into the midst of the
[1:18:43] burning fire furnace now we heard this
[1:18:45] before but look at the mistake that
[1:18:47] Nebuchadnezzar makes
[1:18:49] look at this mistake he sees and who is
[1:18:52] that God that shall deliver you out of
[1:18:55] my hands
[1:18:57] big mistake
[1:18:58] because now God goes sorry
[1:19:04] because now it's not more my children
[1:19:06] now it's me
[1:19:08] but now it's personal because now you
[1:19:10] say I can't heal
[1:19:12] you say I can't save
[1:19:14] Redemption doesn't come from me I died
[1:19:17] on the cross for nothing
[1:19:19] so you take on what I say the prophet
[1:19:22] isn't for us it's not for this age
[1:19:25] The Voice doesn't matter
[1:19:27] hold on
[1:19:28] God will stand for his word
[1:19:31] he has to
[1:19:33] he has to and he and he will stand for
[1:19:35] it just stand for what you believe in he
[1:19:38] will stand because they don't challenge
[1:19:40] you they challenge the very Living God
[1:19:43] that dwells within you this is not a
[1:19:46] flesh and Bone Affair and Flesh and
[1:19:49] Blood this is a spiritual and once they
[1:19:51] challenge what you believe in and this
[1:19:54] word that is true God will come and you
[1:19:56] will confirm it and your words will not
[1:19:58] fall to the ground
[1:19:59] your words will not fall to the ground
[1:20:03] oh we don't serve that God that makes
[1:20:06] that happen
[1:20:07] so now big mistake King nebuchadnez The
[1:20:11] Challenge as a god and Cedric music and
[1:20:13] ubendigo answers the king because guess
[1:20:16] what they believe us so it doesn't
[1:20:18] matter if they die
[1:20:20] great king we are rid of you but our God
[1:20:23] is more than able to Deliver Us from you
[1:20:26] but if he doesn't if he doesn't
[1:20:30] matter I will not bow now I'm
[1:20:33] paraphrasing but we can read in the
[1:20:35] scripture because the Revelation that
[1:20:37] they had is I have no other words who
[1:20:40] has the words of eternal life no man
[1:20:42] spoke like this
[1:20:43] no man spoke like this
[1:20:45] and when I ask him something and he
[1:20:47] confirms it to me I got that Revelation
[1:20:49] the word is to be revealed so once it's
[1:20:52] been revealed in my heart how can you
[1:20:53] move me from it
[1:20:55] how can you move me from it it's been
[1:20:58] revealed I've been standing in front of
[1:21:01] the fire it's hot everybody is cranked
[1:21:04] at seven times harder it's hot
[1:21:07] but is revealed to me nothing will
[1:21:09] happen
[1:21:10] and even if I die I'm just teleported to
[1:21:13] the next round I'm just there I'm
[1:21:15] worshiping already so whoever stays
[1:21:17] behind they lose because I'm already
[1:21:20] worshiping the King of Kings I'm already
[1:21:22] there I've nothing to lose
[1:21:25] amen
[1:21:29] so they get thrown in the fire face down
[1:21:33] good place to be
[1:21:35] and the two gods that throws them in
[1:21:37] parishes at the fire but the Believers
[1:21:39] and verse 21 gets thrown in and they
[1:21:41] fall face down because remember they
[1:21:43] were bound hand and feet
[1:21:44] they were bound
[1:21:46] they fall face down
[1:21:49] now the Way Up Is Down
[1:21:51] and sometimes God has to throw your face
[1:21:54] down on the ground to get your attention
[1:21:56] sometimes God has to to get your
[1:21:58] attention in such a way it makes you run
[1:22:00] into a brick wall and it hurts and the
[1:22:03] trial is fiery and it and and you don't
[1:22:05] understand what God is trying to do but
[1:22:07] hold still
[1:22:09] because all he wants to do is loosen
[1:22:11] your bands
[1:22:12] that's holding you back
[1:22:15] because you're a witness
[1:22:17] I want you to realize you are precious
[1:22:20] in the sight of God you are a witness to
[1:22:22] a Dying World I cannot stretch it enough
[1:22:24] there is not enough of us out there that
[1:22:27] goes to the people that is dying to
[1:22:30] witness this gospel
[1:22:32] there's not enough
[1:22:34] there's not enough people that can get
[1:22:36] attention of someone to say God can heal
[1:22:38] you
[1:22:40] God can save you
[1:22:42] I've just heard a report where where
[1:22:45] um
[1:22:46] and and then we we uh brother-in-law of
[1:22:50] mine is going through a hard time
[1:22:53] not going to accept that
[1:22:55] this is me and my house and all that I
[1:22:58] live will be there and you know what
[1:23:00] that devil has got a party on his hands
[1:23:02] now because his thinking he's having a
[1:23:04] party with my brother-in-law but let me
[1:23:07] tell you one thing I'm going to pray for
[1:23:09] him
[1:23:10] I'm gonna get him back I don't care what
[1:23:12] I need to do but I'm going to raise the
[1:23:14] fight and I said Lord you need to
[1:23:16] intercede here Lord it is my promise
[1:23:18] that you've given me it's my family it's
[1:23:20] my loved ones why shall I let them go to
[1:23:23] that cosine why should the enemy have
[1:23:25] that
[1:23:26] see now you've got a burden now you get
[1:23:28] on your knees now you start praying now
[1:23:30] God will go on the scene he's the Living
[1:23:33] God he's just waiting for you to start
[1:23:35] praying he's waiting for you to start
[1:23:37] interceding he's waiting for you to
[1:23:39] speak to the brother and sister that
[1:23:40] needs that word he's waiting for you
[1:23:43] you're the witness you are so important
[1:23:46] I cannot stretch it more Daniel and
[1:23:51] Bendigo was the most crucial part in
[1:23:54] that book of Daniel
[1:23:56] and the whole book is written around
[1:23:58] them
[1:23:59] because God wants to show you that they
[1:24:02] must be a life that the book of Isaiah
[1:24:04] said even if they throw them in the fire
[1:24:06] I bring that back to your memory it will
[1:24:08] not burn them but someone has to live
[1:24:11] that scripture and they standing there
[1:24:13] and they say Okay throw us in the fire
[1:24:16] because I remember the book of Isaiah in
[1:24:18] verse 43 said even if they throw me in
[1:24:21] that fire I will not die it won't even
[1:24:24] touch me
[1:24:26] so they throw them in the fire
[1:24:30] stands up
[1:24:33] and he sees in verse 24 put that up
[1:24:37] Dalia police here this is a
[1:24:39] Nebuchadnezzar King was astonished and
[1:24:41] Rose up with haste and he spake and he
[1:24:43] said to his counselors that may not cast
[1:24:45] three bound men
[1:24:47] three bound men into the midst of the
[1:24:49] fire they answered to him and said to
[1:24:52] him true O King
[1:24:54] and the next verse
[1:24:56] he says he's answered and said low
[1:24:59] I see four men loose
[1:25:05] so your family won't come I see four men
[1:25:08] loose
[1:25:09] okay you won't make it I see four men
[1:25:13] loose
[1:25:14] no matter how hot the pressure no matter
[1:25:16] how dense it is in your house you can't
[1:25:19] even speak about God before they want to
[1:25:21] throw you with an apple or something
[1:25:22] doesn't matter what is going on around
[1:25:25] you I see four men loose
[1:25:29] that's the testimony
[1:25:31] and King Nebuchadnezzar Cesar
[1:25:35] he says
[1:25:36] walking in the midst of the fire in this
[1:25:39] trial and no hurt and have no hurt and
[1:25:43] the fourth form of the fourth is like
[1:25:46] the Son of God and we had a jubilee in
[1:25:49] our house about that
[1:25:50] how did Nebuchadnezzar know who's the
[1:25:52] son of God
[1:25:56] who's testifying you
[1:25:59] because they are the only one God that
[1:26:02] could interpret his dream and all of a
[1:26:04] sudden he looks in the fire and he sees
[1:26:06] this one standing and he looked forth
[1:26:08] like the Son of God how did he know he's
[1:26:10] the son of God
[1:26:12] how powerful that an unbeliever Pagan
[1:26:16] worship God that raise up a statue can
[1:26:18] see the Son of God how much not more a
[1:26:20] Believer filled with the Holy Ghost can
[1:26:22] see him come on the scene every time
[1:26:24] he's praying
[1:26:25] when he steps into a conversation he
[1:26:27] knows the Son of God is with him when he
[1:26:29] gets challenged he knows God stands
[1:26:31] right with him
[1:26:32] when the doctor says you've got that he
[1:26:34] goes ah Son of God is with him
[1:26:38] see they just walk different
[1:26:41] they just believe different we just look
[1:26:43] different
[1:26:45] so then we finish with this one and then
[1:26:48] I'll read my last quote and I'll be done
[1:26:50] I'm about to close
[1:26:51] then Nebuchadnezzar speak and said
[1:26:53] blessed be the god of sadrach music and
[1:26:56] Abednego who have sent this Angel and
[1:26:58] delivered his servant and trusted in him
[1:27:01] and have changed and have changed the
[1:27:03] king's words and yielded their bodies
[1:27:07] that they might not serve or worship any
[1:27:11] God
[1:27:12] but but see what he says Dee he says who
[1:27:15] have sent the angel and delivered these
[1:27:17] servants that trusted in him
[1:27:20] so that they wouldn't worship my God
[1:27:23] because he he got it wrong
[1:27:26] and he says accept their own God so he
[1:27:29] knows who they're going to stand for
[1:27:32] and I'm going to close with this as the
[1:27:33] musicians come forward
[1:27:36] if you can put up that brother that
[1:27:37] quote dear brother Ben
[1:27:40] sorry he says all right
[1:27:44] here was voices Oh how we need how we
[1:27:48] need in Jeffersonville I say in Stokes
[1:27:50] Valley I say in Wellington I say
[1:27:52] wherever you go thousands of lived
[1:27:54] voices
[1:27:56] don't Don't Preach to me
[1:28:00] live
[1:28:01] show me the life
[1:28:03] he says here the Thunder of God of
[1:28:06] thundering out of the the sweetness and
[1:28:10] Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking
[1:28:13] around on the Earth today or in the
[1:28:15] Earth today without a blemish yes sir a
[1:28:17] real Christian that Thunders against the
[1:28:21] enemy so the witness of God living in
[1:28:24] this world right now walking upon the
[1:28:26] streets you
[1:28:27] you are the Thunder against the enemy
[1:28:31] you are God's answer to this Dying World
[1:28:35] you are the weapon that God can God can
[1:28:37] use to shake a nation
[1:28:41] how powerful
[1:28:44] you are the weapon that God used to
[1:28:46] shake someone out of certain death
[1:28:49] he says the devil don't care how loud
[1:28:51] you holler the devil don't care how much
[1:28:54] you jump or how much you do this or
[1:28:56] shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see
[1:28:59] a a Sanctified holy consecrated to God
[1:29:04] saying say anything to him call him
[1:29:07] anything just sweet as he can be move
[1:29:10] right on
[1:29:11] oh my that throws him and that's the
[1:29:14] Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:29:17] amen I want to play the evidence again
[1:29:20] of your goodness if you may
[1:29:23] I want to say I want to encourage you
[1:29:25] that you are that testimony your life
[1:29:29] speaks louder than any word that you can
[1:29:31] say but I want to say if you do say the
[1:29:34] word it will come back to you because
[1:29:36] what you confess and what you stand for
[1:29:39] needs to be tested to make sure that
[1:29:42] that is what you believe
[1:29:45] foreign
[1:29:51] your life must reflect the word
[1:29:56] because how can you be a witness if you
[1:29:59] say one thing and you do another thing
[1:30:00] if you fall this way and you lean that
[1:30:03] way
[1:30:04] how
[1:30:06] if they don't like you it doesn't matter
[1:30:08] you're still shaking the kingdom of
[1:30:10] heaven and you're shaking the kingdom of
[1:30:13] hell
[1:30:14] because if you shake heaven God will
[1:30:16] come down and I don't mean to push
[1:30:17] against the thunderings that comes down
[1:30:19] and it strikes that demon that's sinning
[1:30:22] within another person that's got him so
[1:30:24] captured that he can't see the Gospel
[1:30:26] Light Shine or glow
[1:30:29] but you're that life when he looked at
[1:30:31] you and go what does he have that I
[1:30:33] don't how can he just believe the word
[1:30:36] and walk on
[1:30:38] it it it you are the conundrum this
[1:30:42] world cannot figure out
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:46] but God wants to use you
[1:30:49] but our focus is everywhere else
[1:30:52] our focus goes to places where we
[1:30:54] shouldn't be
[1:30:56] our time spent is not on our knees
[1:31:00] we're not busy witnessing
[1:31:02] we live
[1:31:04] but we not live such a life that it gets

[1:34:25] know that the battle is great the enemy
[1:34:27] is everywhere father but greater is he
[1:34:29] that lives within us and if we come
[1:34:31] before that enemy Lord that we don't
[1:34:34] need to worry about what we say but the
[1:34:37] Living God that is within us will speak
[1:34:39] that word and Lord that will bring

[1:34:58] gave us a warning you gave us the best
[1:35:01] warning to say there is fire going to
[1:35:03] fall

[1:35:11] they will tell you things that that hurt

[1:35:28] thing if God is living within me and
