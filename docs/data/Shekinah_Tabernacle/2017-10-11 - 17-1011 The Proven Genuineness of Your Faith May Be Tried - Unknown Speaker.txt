thank you musicians good evening everyone so glad you could all come out on this typical spring evening god bless you appreciate it amen well if you got your Bibles handy let's go to 1st Peter 1 & 6 just you've had a good start to the week and we know that everything we face in life God has has a plan and God has got it through so first Peter 1 and 6 sees here wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be yea and heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love and whom though you now see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory I trust you can say that's me receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls Amen may Lord blesses word you may have your seats tonight I want to read that verse first Peter white and 7 from this is from the NIV normally I don't read other other versions but this is this is what it says it says these have come so that so the manifold temptations these have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith of Greater worth than gold which perishes even though refined by fire may result and praise glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed so it's the it's it's so that the genuineness of your faith is showing that's why a that's why the trial of your faith it's to prove if your faith is genuine or not you know we are living in an hour where God is separating from from the believers not people from people but he's taking our human part and our human reasoning a human ideas and separating it from us to really bring forth what's in us you know this message identifies two seeds it identifies God's children and identify God's children and it feels that I believe by grace where all the children of God I trust I trust you can say yes I'm one of him and so now so this message is calling the bride to her bridegroom and so now it is this message reveals really what is in us even though we are not aware of it when we were born but the Prophet tells us that we had a gene seed within our soul that was placed in there before the foundation of the world and that may have laid dormant for maybe many years maybe not many years but in your season in your time God God brought that seed to life and God quickened you and God spoke to you and God's drawn you and the reason he's done that is because there's a seat there but their seed has to come to life and he wants to now prove what is placed now Abraham so this word trial it means a testing there's in the Greek this word trial it means testing about implication or trustworthiness a trial or a trying now Abraham we are the children of Abraham by faith Amen we are the children of Abraham and so Abraham it says in Hebrews 11 and 17 it says by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac that he that he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son now this would try it means to scrutinize it means to si to examine and this word si here yo there's something called an essay or an asset test where we're a geologist we'll take a column of rock take take big columns of rock and they will take that and they'll take sections of it and they'll pull put it in a thing called a ball mill they'll crash it to powder then they'll examine what's in the rock and so this is what Abraham he went through this essay test this great test where he was reduced to powder because God was going to examine down to the detail what sinew Abraham what sin you what's been placed in you Abraham because you know many times it's not us or not rather God wants to show what's in you I mean when we can look back and say I overcame God help me over come this test and God and I was going through a trial and I didn't know that where I was going but my sheep hear my voice is stranger and I'll follow and I followed his voice and and it says in the scripture though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou rod my staff they comfort me I mean so many times he lead us because he leads us every day of our lives really cautious of it or not and so he wants us to look back at our life and say God helped me caused me to overcome in that trial and even if I fail that's not him that falls at him that gets back up and says Lord try me one more time I'm sure we've all been there a few times you find yourself face down on the on the mat and the boxing ring and you're saying you your opponent Satan and many times actually yourself you find yourself you know you've been you've been knocked out and then you come to yourself and say how did it come to this but then you say Lord try me again I want to go another round hallelujah I'm not satisfied with being defeated by this thing whether it's the enemy or yourself you know that you're the Prophet tells us Satan was defeated at Calvary so our greatest enemy you have is you brother BAM says the grace enemy I have is William Branham if I can get him out of the way I think God can do things I know nothing about I mean so now abraham was essayed he was s8 he was tried hallelujah and he came forth as gold because he is willing the blessing that he received he is willing to give it back now the root word of this word tried actually comes from a word through the idea of piercing amen so so so when your tribe is actually a piercing goes on I mean when your hardship or God Himself he Pierce's you I mean through the trial remember trials aren't yo it says count it all joy how can I count this joy and being pierced I'm being s8 I'm being I'm being crushed to powder I'm being examined hallelujah it's not an easy thing amen yeah you may look I might be going through a trial and you may look at it say that's nothing but it could be it could be big to me and of it and and and vice versa because godly ages children in a specific way because he wants to bring us forth as gold I'm so glad that's the case so it comes through the idea of piercing this test Amen to to essay us because he wants to prove the genuine of our faith let's go to John chapter 6 because I want to I want to ask the question tonight I think I think I asked many questions but I want to ask you this question how genuine is your faith why why have you become a believer why are you here I'm not talking about these four walls I'm talking about walking with the revealed word of the hour why have you come to him why have you gathered why have you gathered to him many gathered to the son of man in his first coming they gathered to him but their motives weren't pure all of them some of them had pure motives many didn't have pure motives and Jesus said some things and did some things because he wanted to prove the genius of their faith and it goes all the way from the multitude to the seventeenth to the twelve and they came a test don't don't misunderstand me - no please because even Peter Peter got assayed Peter got tested because there's a part of him that he was still very much alive but there's a part of him where God revealed that crisis only living God but the human but had to go away because when you si for gold when you're looking for golf you know when you when you get a whole bunch you are out of the ground that not all that is gold not all yo it could be a big massive boulders just a little bit of gold I mean but but the miners they know that God's there and they'll do anything they know it's worth it to get the gold out it's the same thing with God he looks over the earth maybe you're a part of earth you're a part of the earth and he found you it begins the SAU because there's some gold in there that he wants he doesn't want the human but he wants the good he wants himself in you wit come forth as gold hallelujah so you know when we're when were battling through something it seems like we just kind of almost just in the gravel on the side of the highway and well you know I mean there's a ravine and you're just kind of holding on while he's driving anyway but you should just be happy Lord you're dealing with me thank you I'm glad you're dealing with me amen because it's good if he's dealing with you because he has a purpose in doing it now John 6 and where are we we're in verse 22 it says here the day following when the people were on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save one where and to his disciples were entered and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where he did eat bread after the Lord had given for thanks when the people wherefore saw that Jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took ships they also took shipping and came to Capernaum seeking for Jesus and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou jesus answered them and said fairly Vili I said to you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man hath given unto you for he hath God for he hath God the Father sealed shall and then then they then said and him what shall we do that we might work the works of God many people ask the same question today jesus answered and said this is the work of God that ye believe on whom he hath sent so here was a bunch of people here was the Messiah they came for food this is why they gathered to him they're the reason they gathered to him it wasn't out of because here's the lamb here's ridhima he's the one who's going to purchase my salvation on Calvary's tree he's the one who can set me free from darkness now I just want food so there so their motive of coming it wasn't a genuine but now God's know Jesus is going to prove the generous of their faith because they believe he could do it again they had some kind of faith in him but it's just a human faith and so and then and then we can continue reading down but we won't read the whole chapter but then then Jesus begins to speak about eating in flesh and drinking his blood and he started with about 5,000 people there and they're there at the side of John chapter 6 he ends up with 12 after after one service because he's asking the question now why have you come you've just come four loaves and fishes and then he says yeah and then even the seventy that he that he ordained to do supernatural miracles they left him and it says in the scriptures that many of his disciples walked with him no more so now they're going through an essay why what why why have you gathered to the Son of Man in this hour Jesus Christ who is the message of the hour why have you come I just I really want to want you to think about this what is my mode of an objective people have a lot of motives people gathered to Jesus you take Judas he was a thief he had the money bag he wanted to get rich this was his before coming he had a motive some people want to come because they want to have a great name or they want some kind of name and that's why they come some people want popularity some people want money what's your motive for coming have you ever thought about it what is your motive some people just want to influence on some people they want to do another thing but what's your motive only John only only the Gospel of John says that Judas was a thief and because of the prophetic anointing on that gospel had actually showed what was in the man it's got a Deuteronomy chapter 8 and 2 there's a reason why we go through things in life there's the reason why Trials come deuteronomy Adin Adin 1 we'll go down to verse 3 to fix that this is Moses speaking now they've been journeying 40 years this is his last address to the people of Israel and he's going to show them why they went through everything I went through God needs to show us sometimes why did I go through this why did I suffer this Y is actually life seem to be harder since I being a believer since when I was in the world why is it more challenges why is there more struggles why is there it's because you're going through an essay because the genuineness of your faith is being tried it's being proven and because God is not a saying or testing you to show that you're a that that your wasn't fool's gold you know you know these rock that looks like gold that's called fool's gold God doesn't put you through a trial to say hey you're actually fool's gold he puts you through a trial to show you you're a real gold and you're the highest grade of gold there is hallelujah this that's why he allows you to go through things he wants to show you I trust that the genuineness of your faith is a hundred percent genuine you're here with a pure motive pure objective I've heard his voice in this our baby I'm jumping ahead of myself too far but I don't want you to feel like oh bit of a slump why am I here I don't really like this kind of thing but I want you to see when you see when you see your life and where you've been and where you're going God wants to prove what's in you Satan I told you they were gold and look at them they're shining like the Sun hallelujah they're shining like me they look like me Alleluia hey it makes makes parents real proud when they see their children they look just like me and they act just like me now they can be good or bad but hey Alleluia with God there's no bad characteristic so you know Deuteronomy 18 1 all the commandments which I commanded thee this day shall ye observe to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord we're unto your father's and thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what is in thine heart oh this is why Trials come whether thou could escape his Commandments or not and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord Duffman live by raiment wax not old upon me neither did thy foot swell these forty years thou shalt also consider a 9 heart that as man chest either says son so the LORD thy God chastises thee hallelujah therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him Alleluia then no that's not a terror but a reverential fear and Trust that's what the word fear means amen so now he's so saying now this is why you went through the wilderness this is why you're in slavery this is why you went through the Red Sea this is why after the rich City you came to the waters of Marah which were bitter that's why he had no food in the wilderness and I sent manner and all the different things that happened that's why when the enemy came against you you know I fought your battles for you I proved myself and I proved what was in you because when the pressure came on now what were the people going to do there are a couple there that are Joshua and Caleb said we're more than able to take the land only because here was the trial the trial of their faith now the genuineness many people that said a mixed multitude left Egypt a mixed multitude win with Moses and so there would have been people there they went for whatever reason they went but there are a few that sit remember what our grandfather Abraham or great-great-great whatever grandfather Abraham said we're going to a promised land and God will send a deliverer and he's here and that's that man there Moses that's the fulfillment of the scripture and he's taking and God will take us into the Promised Land let's go hallelujah and they went and it was and then he came the pressure now can they take the land can or not take the land and ten spies said no to said yes and God was with the - hallelujah one was called Caleb and Caleb I think his name it means a dog Amen he was he wasn't didn't have some great princely name but he comes he says Here I am I want this mountain the genuine of genuineness of his faith was tried and proven he genuinely believed the promise he generated believed he was called he generally believed that there was a possession the land for him each any we believe God will give it to him and he genuinely believed that wherever he would walk Amen God would give him the victory and and it happened how lujah and was under the blood of bulls and goats not even under the blood of Jesus Christ amen and they conquered you know he took his position and there he was his faith was proven to be genuine hallelujah so now God God gathers God gathers his children he proves what's in them so there's a reason why we go through hardship and trial because he God really wants to prove what is it 9 heart and is not in the good times where we can really prove if we're believers or not the good times really we can be on the mountaintop shouting and rejoicing having a glorious time but it's really we're in the valleys ever in the battles ever in the hardship that's really where God can show you this is what's in you you know the believer you know if you're a believer tonight everything you have need of us in you by the new birth everything you have need of your fully equipped you just don't know what's in you you don't know what the power you know I know when God God really got a hold of me I didn't fully know what was going on I knew he called me I knew I knew he was leading me to fully surrender to him and you he transformed me but that's all I didn't really know too much apart from apathy begins to open his word and take you through experiences like David David's faith was proven to be genuine he was a man now this is genuine faith God will take care of my enemies God will take care of everything soul soul was still kindly minded the Spirit of God was with Saul and with David but he still calmly minded he was scared he used fear to try and keep his kingdom together he used fear to bring the men of Israel together to fight you know and he was worried because he believed you know Samuel said that the kingdoms taken from you and now he's living in fear and now he's trying to kill his opposition all these things David wasn't like that he was angry at the man who claimed that he killed Saul on the battlefield how deed had killed the Lord's anointed you'll lose your life you know he was he was angry he was angry at these ones he could have killed him a few times you know the story but he was a man with genuine faith I'll take care of my enemy God will take care of them there's a reason why I'm on the run from them God's wanting to prove and gods won't approve what sin you amen sometimes sometimes we defeat our enemy sometimes we have to run from our enemy Paul went into a city smote a man blind and then and then a couple of cities later there's a coppersmith he says beware this coppersmith he's talking to one of the disciples he did be much how he drove now the city sometimes it happens that way do you know your New Testament so different things happen but God really wants to prove now do you know what's in you do you understand it's not a like David he used the sling against Goliath you never use the sling again he had a sword or he had a different kind of weapon and sometimes God said go attack them here at the time he said no do something else and God was showing him he was leading him in different ways because we because he wants to prove himself in different ways you know God doesn't just control alt delete' he leads us in a different ways you understand he's not just one hit wonder this is one-trick pony kind of thing but he leads us in different ways because he wants to show you that mean but we are his disciple are we no and a disciple is made by doing not by theory it's by practical experience you become a disciple I Luis that's why he takes you through trials and hardship because he's making your disciple he wants to prove himself in this situation and in this situation in this situation and he's also willing to prove now now how are you going to treat the other person how you gonna treat the other person because the enemy oh you know David said you know David said Oh God will take care of them and many times our enemies carnally they're our enemies but in reality they're our friends and the devil's got us shooting each other instead of shooting the devil amen and brother Brown speaks about zeals now we need wisdom and the seller problem says he says about zeal he says he says people get too zealous actually they actually cause denominational splits they fight for their denomination so much because they're so zealous that they actually hurt other brethren we say we're not a denomination we can still be too zealous in the wrong way zeal without wisdom is not as it's just like a rapid fire and I'll hit something as long as I hit something but it's not ways because there's too much blue on blue you know shooting the same side but my my course is just that God won't say hold on hold on you got a I want to teach you some wisdom don't fly off the trigger too quickly yeah he needs David was showing David was spirit lead he didn't just kill Saul he didn't just come against his enemy no he didn't know God will take care of that amen you follow I think I'm and they were men that gathered to David and their faith they believed he was coming to power and you know there is a story there but now our faith has to be proven genuine the Apostle Peter let's go to let's go to John 6 if you're still there let's go back there John sixin and 66 so Jesus is already spoken about at least you drink my flesh eat my blood you have no life in you you know he says these things basically if I left them and then from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with them then said Jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away now listen to this great eloquence of declaration of faith the in Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and assure that thou art that Christ the Son of the Living God that sounds like a good confession of faith but then Jesus just looked at them and jesus answered them said have not I chosen you twelve and one of you is the devil so he was is Jesus basically said no no no no the disciples are basically saying we will not how can we leave you you have the words of eternal life we can't where else can we go we'll never leave you Jesus and you think that Jesus say good on your boys I'm proud of you I knew you had it in you I knew you were you know when I called you I knew that you had come all the way he didn't say anything like that he said have I not chosen you who want of you as a devil and he just left it like that because he wanted to prove the genuineness of their faith now we understand the next verse he says he spoke Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for he for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve now here's Peter thou art the Christ of so loving God when he's asked ya when Jesus asked his disciples and Matthew 16 who demean say that I am he says who do you say that I am he was the only one that said at that at the crisis a Living God and probably would have felt maybe proud himself all good hallelujah I gave the right because it's his blessed art thou simon barjona ho the Messiah said I'm blessed got what over you John something you know he would have felt proud in himself that part had to go because this human face and his revealed faith and the revealed faith because we mean to live by the faith of Jesus Christ by the faith his faith in us it's how we live it's not here it's not faith this is not a play on words it's not our faith is not meant to be now I got to get this right because I get things mixed up all the time we mean to live by the faith of the Son of God Paul says by his faith we mean to live the just shall live by faith which is the faith of God himself and youth it's not meant to be human faith in Him it's meant to be revealed faith in him right faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God every person in the world has human faith even the Atheist beliefs well 10 billion whatever a million years ago you know in a deep sea hydrothermal vent there was there was active there was a porous column made by the volcanic activity which came out and it made iron sulfur sites and then organic compounds came and they bonded these iron sulfur sites and then eventually amino acids came it's actually what they believed I studied at uni I know I'm talking about they actually believe that's true that's what they believe but they can't prove it in the lab so what happens there's an element of faith and they and they won't they're not willing to go down to that part of the beginning because their own science disproves it so I'll go to a basic single-cell organism they're multiplying whatever evolution but they won't go to the beginning because they can't prove it will say well that requires faith because they have to because they can't prove it they have to believe it's happened so every human being has a faith but it is human faith it is not revealed faith well what does reveal faith when God speaks to your heart and it becomes more than just something in here do you understand what that is when God speaks to you when God speaks units more than just in here but it's in here something happens to you that is now God revealing himself to you that is revealed faith hallelujah so now but Peter he had he had human faith and then he had revealed faith but then now when the pressure came on him God was going to si him to bring forth that a revealed faith and get rid of the human faith because Peter went through a great trial are you following me so far because remember Peter said we'll die with you I'll die with you Lord you know took the sword Jesus saw the vision of a man here getting cut off do we ever sword we've got to or wine or whatever Jesus is it's enough Peter give me that sword I'm just dramatizing John Andrew I'll take the sword big fisherman big rugged fisherman he's going to pack this thing to this fight that may happen and here he is maybe no doubt with the flourish draws it I'll protect you Jesus he can't use a sword so he cuts the man's ear off and said of the head because it just swings it wildly Peter Jesus stop and maybe Peters in the heat of the moment what do you mean I'm defending the faith that's how some people are I'm going to defend the faith against these heathens this message is true this is how it should be this is the doctrine I'll defend the faith they just cut off someone's here so they can't hear it anymore God these Jesus needs to heal that wound I trust I'm not looking at any Peters tonight it's true isn't it cuz of zeal with no wisdom so now and then Jesus put the sword away heals a man's ear and then and then all the disciples fled and I may be wrong but from reading the from being the Gospels maybe this is a test was Peter the only one that went to where the trial was this is now was Peter the only one that went to outside where the trial of Jesus was was he the only one was he more than one other disciples well here's the only one question that I know of but here he was he's here he's one is they where where Jesus is and then a woman comes along aren't you one of those disciples of Jesus no I don't know him he comes a trial of his faith he was struggling with a sword thing he's doing the right thing but now he's on he doesn't know what's going on this pride this human pride that he has religion message pride must die and now he's gonna be s8 and he buckles under the questioning he doesn't stand for the faith anymore and he any denies of Jesus tells him you'll deny me thrice and P doesn't Peter basically without saying it he says I don't believe you cuz he didn't he didn't say no lord please I don't have to do that you know he basically said no I'll never do that in his heart this is me this is the Gospel according to Ben coloring in the picture I hope it's still part of the picture in the lines but he said within himself basically I won't deny you and now here comes the pressure on he denies him three times sui's doing it because he's a human pride a human faith that must go hallelujah but then now but they no but there's a good place to be because what if what if Jesus just let Peter go on like this he couldn't be the spokesman for in the book of Acts he couldn't be used by the Lord that's why trials and you know that's why the Lord looks down into you you know you open the word and he puts his finger on your life there's this pride there's this arrogancy this is this and this and this and this and you say oh god take it from me well you can only do that we ask him and you can only do it when he shows you because we have we're we're you know horses got blinders on you see if I see a horse like this their vision is like this now horses are prey animal with their eyes are on the side the hits that they can see quite a lot then the blinkers just they can only see this much this is like us walking along in life how lujah I'm a believer but then sometimes God and then there's all the stuff here you don't see it they can be pride jealousy small man syndrome small woman syndrome and comforta land your own skin whatever you want to put there can be right here and can be affecting your whole life then one day he goes like this and you see this big horror story I have I really been like this for so long oh god take it from me but before but before he takes the blinker off you're just walking along Alleluia isn't he good he's so gracious because he shows member he he doesn't show us things in our lives to basically give us a death sentence by that thing he shows us to take it from us Alleluia so now here he is and then and then the you know then Jesus crucified he bodies put in the tomb the woman go to the tomb and they come back saying he's risen and his people but then Jesus says go tell my disciples and Peter he must have been pretty happy when he heard those words and Peter huh I'm so thank you Lord because you'd think cuz cuz he went and worked when and wept bitterly when he heard the crow and I think he saw Jesus when Jesus walked out and his mind went back where Jesus said you'll deny me three times and his heart would have God like a lead balloon I've failed them I've really failed them the oh I've gone too far there's a man there was a man Judas he went too far but he hung himself he didn't you know he should have gone to Pentecost he really should have gone to Peter cost but Jesus I mean Peter somehow somehow he knew there's more somehow I can still be maybe forgiven if I see him again and then they're fishing in Galilee there's a man on the on the seashore have you caught any fish children and in John looks over at Peter or not maybe one of them says no we haven't caught anything and then he says put your net on the other side of the boat maybe I thought we've done there for office okay we'll do it say yo so they throw they know on the other side hundred I think the Bible says like a hundred and fifty three fish God is in detail hallelujah and then John looks at sister Peter it's the Lord and then Peter puts up the member he's bowed down by this his own condemnation I've denied him I've done wrong and it's great I'll win it when he needed me I failed I failed bitterly unjust fell a little bit I do I just failed miserably I buckled under questioning of woman and in those days woman were second-class citizens in Israel he buckled under questioning a woman he couldn't even stand there saying yes I wasn't your I am his disciple but then he sees him on the on the seashore he puts on his Fisher's coat and he begins swimming hallelujah he's a man God knows how to humiliate us sometimes we have to be humiliated in order of him to separate to 2si us hallelujah because we are we would Naaman the powers resurrection but the likeness of his sufferings hey Jesus was hanging on a cross and he was naked before the people he was humiliated that day and there's a part of that suffering and humiliation for us but there's a reason for it and see here comes Peter with his weight of condemnation he comes he just comes to him hallelujah he just comes to him and then Jesus begins to speak to him to one side Peter do you love me now here's the genuineness of faith here's the genuine you say well how do i how do you know because i've throw it out a lot of questions well how do you know your faith is genuine well Peters being asked a question and Peter's being asked this question by Jesus himself do you love me and to me if you have genuine love and whom you have genuine faith if you genuinely love him then your faith will be genuine amen your faith will be genuine if you love him he says Lord I love you he says feed my sheep and then feed my lambs and then the third question Peter just says Lord you know I love you you know my heart hallelujah so Peter went through an essay he went through a great essay and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and his disciples don't change either so he allows these to happen because he's really look at you and he's asking you the question do you love me as your faith genuine that the genuineness of your faith will be tried or be proven that's the great question in this day because if you have genuine for him then you'll have genuine faith because if you genuinely love him not humanly but divine love comes in because here's that the whole the holy God the love of God is she'd abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us and that love is not human love that varies worth worth with condition and and how people treat you first divine love which is a constant love that doesn't change if things are good of things are bad things are up things are down is it love hallelujah and and that's a genuine love it will produce a genuine faith I trust you have that now hallelujah it doesn't matter what happens in life Paul said I'm going to be offered up you know I don't think he may be you know humanly when he was in the prison near the the mammoth time prison whatever it's called there you know he was he was in this place and he was beating a near shipwrecked and all different kinds of things happened but God allowed that to happen to him because God was proving to him your faith is genuine amen he didn't have an easy road he had enemies without em with us when he said he fought the beast in Ephesus it wasn't it wasn't Lions in an arena it was people it was religious spirits on people and I believe just like brother bear Amir brother bear has I think Billy Paul said about his father he spoke of his enemies and his friends to say she couldn't tell who was what and that was now that was the son of man revealing an a son of men a mature believer this is how he this is how he spoke of others now what about us what about us because here was a mature son here was gold that was refined in the fire and he was in a real fire Alleluia to show us remember we're norm in the pelvis resurrection and we love that part of the verse don't we see God come down transformed people turn us from death to life hallelujah God move it open his word and all these things but in likeness of the sufferings we would know him in the likeness of his sufferings Alleluia we have some musicians to come find us in the sufferings praise God for suffering I know that sound you say brother Ben that's crazy praise God for suffering because if he is if he is our Shepherd and he he's not a New Zealand Shepherd that gets a whole bunch of dogs and chases some some sheep but he calls him by name and he speaks to them and they know his voice and they come to Hermes he's gonna lead you hallelujah but the Sheep loved the shepherd the sheep loved the ship and I trust you love him so if he's leading you now if he's leading you through something you would have confidence he won't leave me here because he won't lose one of hers amen and then he said to Joe I'm John's disciples John is now in prison and brother Graham says his Eagle eyes have have clouded over and he sends disciples to Jesus asking are you him or should we look for another and then Jesus tells the disciples of John sit down we could have a meeting and I'll show you what happens there you're the lame walk and the blind see in the sick of heal that all different things happen then they take the report back to John and Jesus says blessed is he there's not offender than me so he's saying to John blessed are you if you're not offended that you're now in prison at the end of your ministry amen so the question is now do we get offended when God leads us through dark places do we get offended by oh I shouldn't have done this shouldn't have happened to me and this is wrong and what's going on God and you know but in an angry way because we know I think we can't ask him what's happening that's your approach but I'm the Bride of Christ and this shouldn't happen to me and this should all be fine and everything should just work out fine well is that what was that God stepped for you or do you get offended at it I trust Lisa to see that's not offended in him I mean you know do we get offended if we lose our jobs or if we or if we don't have enough money in the bank or if we can't buy that new car or if our family maybe begins to fall apart or someone goes sideways or do we get offender than that I trust we don't but we had this ideal picture of how things should be but is it God's plan for your life God you know God you know sometimes God will take someone like and the majority really experience can be four years but God is revealing himself in that life so so some people seem to have a great overcoming life they just crest every wave other people are submarines and they're dragging on the bottom but they're moving but God it doesn't mean God's pleased with one and displeased with the other one God has ordained the steps of you know the steps is a good manner ordered of the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall lower for how he shall not be cast down so that's why we should never doesn't matter what other people are doing you know to be honor okay so it's been my family because we're one but everyone now well it's it's God at us and God and your family and God in your family you have to walk sovereignly it's it's not my hand your hand in his hand in a way at the end of the day I'm not going to be standing next to you you know what I mean it's you and God individual affair between you and God and he will lead you the way he's going to lead you and he's not going to lead you in a way that is just gonna send you to ruin he's gonna let you walk down a path for a reason because he wants to express part of himself in your life and that part will be different for all of us hallelujah because he wants to sa you you see you see David's essay was different to Abraham's essay which is different to Moses essay which is different to Isaiah as I say at Jeremiah Elijah they're all tested just like Peter James and John their testing was different John the Baptist was different it's all different si but God is proving their gold their gold they go their gold their gold Alleluia and God doesn't change amen let's um I want to sing I believe the true report I believe the true report hallelujah to the lamb amen I trust your faith the trust the genuineness of your faith has been tried that's why we go through things God wants to see how you're going to react how are you going to react to the situation it's like Joe let's see how he's going to react God knew how I'd react but Jobe actually he wanted to prove to Joe hey this is how you reacted in this situation and with his mouth he didn't curse God didn't actually speak against them at all so God God actually allows it see how you gonna react how you gonna wreck that the ones you love the most turn against you I make gaku cause the whole church to turn against you how you gonna react oh they hate God would never have caused that to happen how do you know God could cause the goodness of things to happen misunderstandings then he asked the question have you looked What's in you how you gonna react you get around to going to the sky or the faith that's in you is the challenge I believe the true report
