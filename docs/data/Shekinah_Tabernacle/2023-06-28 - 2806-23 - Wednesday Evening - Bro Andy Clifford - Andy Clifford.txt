we're thirsting for you Lord we've heard the the specials Lord and father bless the the special singers Lord and we've been blessed by these things father and just thank you Lord that Lord truly Lord it is our desire to be Lord walking in the fullness of our privilege that you have ordained for us to walk in and so Lord I pray that your blood would speak to us tonight Lord that the New Testament would speak to us that the heart of God would speak to us whether we're here in this room or where many of us are streaming tonight Lord I ask that you would gather your Eagles to the word we've come to Feast Lord on you on your word Lord just have your way now we yield we just say Lord speak to our hearts now and take control of every Spirit Lord for the glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ we love you Jesus amen hallelujah isn't he wonderful isn't God good Hallelujah we haven't sung that song for a while ever isn't God good we won't sing it now but I like I like that thought you know and I think we should always just we should refresh ourselves on how good God is amen and just think on him hallelujah amen thank you musicians um hallelujah praise the Lord and just so grateful to be having this opportunity again and and just want to um while you're standing can I have you turn in your scriptures to um um sorry uh Ephesians 1. and we're going to read from verse 3 through to 12. amen I've done the mistake I said I would not do I can't even see that can you see it no one can see that okay you definitely have to turn in your scriptures then amen Hallelujah I'll go to that thing again so I want to speak tonight on um the subject uh hold on oh there we go I resonate with that this has been an exciting subject for me for a long time and I'm telling you in a long time years yes but you know things just Brew for years and years and years um these thoughts and I got this thought about five years ago but then I about about six seven weeks ago that came on my heart to share it with the church so I've been now really refining it down to what I feel is the Lord's intention tonight hey man who believes that a service doesn't have to be just sit here and listen and learn something but a a an event yes sir hey man so let's make this not just another Wednesday service but by faith this can be an event for you and God Hallelujah sorry I'm keeping you standing um blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ before I read any further I just want to tell you that this is the symphony okay this is God's Symphony this is and and we're being called to resonate with the symphony okay so I just want to read this with youth thinking in your mind this is God's Symphony and a symphony is a artwork it is an expression of a composer and God is a great composer and he's expressed a symphony of redeeming love expressed and the attributes of his nature expressed to the Earth and to his people so that everything that's in him could be expressed and so as I read this I just want you to have that angle in your heart and mind amen so this is God's Symphony and we'll elaborate on that a bit later so I didn't want to just throw that at you but I just thought it's better to have that Angle now according as he has chosen us and him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us I'm so glad about that unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will oh my what a will what a will amen he's left us a good one amen and to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption I just want you to say that we have Redemption I say I have Redemption Glory it makes me feel real happy through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will and should I say having made known unto us his Symphony his composition his great amazing artwork but he has it's expressed from him amen and so the Forgiveness of sins oh sorry I'm going backwards now having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times here we are hello we're in the fullness of times right now it's the fullness we're at the end of it all he might gather together all and won all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on the earth even in him Amen in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will that we should be that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ amen you may be seated God bless his word amen if you can turn that back to these um to the PowerPoint that'll be lovely thank you man did I really do that oh my Allah I want to speak tonight on I resonate with that amen and I believe that tonight the Lord can really speak to us so let me just lay a little Foundation but I just want you to invite the Lord to where you're at I want I I just encourage you now don't let this service pass you by without you coming into a Revival amen amen amen I believe that's the Law's intention tonight and so if you're all stressed or if you're all anxious or you're just busy and you're wound up and there's all this tension in your life Let It Go that's not going to help you you know you might be enjoying all the things that you're doing and everything that's going on and you're busy and all those things but all that's going to do is it's going to rob you of being able to resonate with the word of God being able to resonate with the Symphony of God because you see you're being called to come into resonating a resonant frequency I'm going to I'm going to do some Physics tonight okay so I might just go through that first otherwise I'll start saying things and you'll be like oh my Andy's sang it all again those big long words where did you get those from I don't know they just kind of came Microsoft Word and thesauruses and synonyms okay that's where it all came from what's another word for this it needs to Rhyme or it needs to do this and I kind of found a way to and it just stuck so anyway now I want to before I go any further outmaster copy right do you believe that you have a Master Copy you know and if there's a master copy of you and it's in glory Hallelujah there is a body that is waiting and it says here Paul says in second Corinthians 5 verse 1 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle we're dissolve this is this body if it died or if it was dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens amen that means that there's a master copy of you that has never began it will never end and it's in glory today when I was still in prison the first thing that God revealed to me was that if I was ever going to be there I'm Already There amen so you can rest in that fact that all the stuff that you go through it doesn't matter you're already there amen so you've got a master copy that Master Copy is in Revival oh my that Master Copy it doesn't know no Darkness it doesn't know no fear it doesn't know no sickness it doesn't know anything and that's Master Copy if you could just dip into that sound wave tonight Omar you would start singing out the Symphony of your own life the one that never began and will never end would you like to resonate with that tonight who would like to resonate with their true frequency who would like to vibrate at the vibration of God's love and God's faith and God's joy it's a vibration it's a place and you're there you're there oh my this body oh my goodness it's not there all the time help me Lord you know one of my biggest prayers I say Lord let the Revival that's in my soul come into my body too let the Revival that's in my soul come into my spirit as well and right through me you know sometimes it's just hiding so deep and you know it's there because it's just you know you're so stabilized and God is so real to you and yet you can be struggling and you can be having fights within and you can be having mind battles and you can go through trials and oh my goodness your body and your emotional realm is just so far away from where your soul is because your soul is sealed until the day of your Redemption and it's in your soul has received that portion of the Holy Spirit but just because this world that we live in the sticky nature that we're born with and all the things that we're surrounded by and the things that we feed on the things that we watch and our responsibilities and children and all the pressures and everything that we go through it all just starts to distort in different Realms of our lives and this is why we need to come in and have a refreshing that is why when we come to church make it worthwhile don't just sit there children don't you know if I look at you and I say children doesn't mean that you're a child I just you know sometimes you just look around and you just lock an eye but it doesn't mean I'm Ben knows exactly what I'm talking about sometimes you just happen to lock in and you're saying that very thing and normally you think they think they're saying that to you and all oh lord well you can take it anyway amen we should just take it hallelujah amen so physics now we'll just do a little run of physics and I'm going to show you something so a piano string right um well he's not a real piano in here but the hammer hits the string when you push down this thing right now that's not working now but if you push that down it will in a real piano there's a little hammer and it hits the string and this the string goes like this right it bounces that's called vibration so there you go that's A1 physics that's vibration everything vibrates right and I'm telling you everything that you see in this physical Dimension is vibrating in some way shape or form your your thoughts have frequency but God's love is frequency your heartbeat is vibrating it's vibrating at about 60 hertz or whatever you know it's going to do like 60 beats per minute 80 beats per minute is about average between those two um it's vibrating it's got a frequency it's just going up and down it's and so this strength is vibrating and that's its frequency right so here we have another gun remember I'm talking about I resonate with that so I'm going to get into a little bit of resonance because has anyone ever said I resonate with that before it resonates with me feels good I feel like I'm harmonizing with this thing you know sometimes it doesn't resonate and you're like man this vibration is not very good this is a bad Vibe you know I never heard that now we can't trust Vibe either vibrations and emotions and all that room you can't trust it but it can guide you but you can't let it be your ultimate the word of God is your ultimate the Holy Spirit confirming you leading your life is the ultimate but we're in a world of vibration and so there's a lot of these things that we need to see but you see the holy spirit is also vibrating there's resonance see the Lord has got a symphony in its go and there's a lot of people in that Symphony have you noticed in the Bible the Bible is a book of stories of people it's not just this you know we look at this thing and we think oh it's just this big book right before you get saved and you get the Holy Ghost you're like oh my this big book this big book but then when you start to get personal with God he begins to reveal to you that this is a book of people's lives and those people were inspired by God and God used those people they resonated with God's mind and their Master Copy in heaven they begin to play out the music they beat it out the vibration of their own life they became resonant they resonated with who they were they resonated with God's plan for their life and God wrote the Bible with them so if God can write the Bible with them we may resonate how much can God write a Bible with you that people if there was another thousand years it would be the continuation of the book of Acts and they would read your life and get saved by it you know that you can read the life of Ruth and get saved you know that yeah yeah you can read the life of Esther and get say because something in that life has got faith and it was God inspired it resonated sorry I'm getting ahead of myself but let's go back to physics uh who wants to go back to school anyone want to go back to school this is we're just doing real Applied Physics here okay this is really Applied Physics okay we're really going to apply this spiritually that thing there is one sound wave right and that might be uh uh now that has a lot of variance in it but that's okay this sound wave will be [Music] there you go so those four things I'm not going to do the whole octave okay I'm only doing the the fifths no way but I'm gonna get the guitar out soon because there's lots of cool things but um so this thing here is this one is exactly double that one right if that that means that this one and that one will work together that means that they're tuned together and I'm going to talk to you about being tuned soon because it's one of the most important things of your life if you want to resonate with something you need to be tuned to the same key the same frequency it might not necessarily be the same note but it got to be in the same frequency the same key concert C is what they tune Orchestra to unless someone makes a a bold thing to change something that's always going to be where it's at right constant C and that's where they tune in so they're all vibrating in a frequency that all works together right so all of their different instruments are either going to be sound waves that are either this you know and or they're going to be like this or like this or like this right and if it doesn't do that if the patterns don't match up like that and vibrate at proper multiples of of one three sevens and all the numbers of God by the way then it won't work properly it won't sound very nice it'll sound like it's been detuned has anyone ever picked up a detuned instrument it just doesn't sound very good that's how we were born by the way we were born like that so here's a sound wave right and the sound wave like this is very quiet but the light bigger the wave the louder it is the longer the wave the lower it is the higher the wave that was as high as I can go I think would have to get into the nasal cavity probably to go a bit higher than that oh my but I'll definitely be kicked out of the South African men's club if I did that oh my that's a that's a very hard Club to stay in me and Isaac we're just like life unmembered you know oh man I was accepted to me yesterday's like I said Isaac you clean your car he goes man I'm trying to get back into the South African men's club oh my a churning Fork right a tuning fork is actually so the way a tuning fork works is they make it so that when you bang it it's going to bang at a certain pitch and they use these to tune instrumentally in the old days when they didn't have digital they that's what they tuned to and it was a which was 440 Hertz which is the based off the main tuning of all instruments and all guitars violins everything and wind instruments all of that stuff is made to be uh tuned to concert C right everyone does anyone know what I'm talking about is anyone here not know what I'm talking about c c is like the like foundational vibration of music for all composite music unless somebody wants to get a bit funny on it and do other things then they that's what they're going to be playing but what I want to talk about here is when you bang this tuning fork this one here which is not even connected begins to sympathetically resonate sympathetic resonance and I want you to realize that you are to your call to sympathetically resonate to now I'm not talking about just sympathizing with the word no but you need to sympathize with the word in another way but not just sympathize because this sympathy that I'm talking about is not that sympathy that sympathy is a different meaning let's just rule that out now okay so if I say sympathize I'm not talking about just kind of sitting on the fence I'm talking about resonating I'm talking about you being interested in such a way that when God speaks you resonate when God speaks your tuning forth starts vibrating too and something happens in your life but for that to happen you need to be at rest I'll just Chuck that and now I'll come back to that a bit later but tuning fork base starts to sympathize so you remember how brother Branham at the end of his ministry he would talk about the symphony and then all of a sudden he starts using the word sympathy and you think oh brother Branham you know I thought at first oh you know he's not really educated so he's thinking sympathy meaning Symphony but actually when you look at it he's actually talking about a proper musical term which is actually the recipient of the symphony which is you you are the sympathy of God's Symphony so that you and you know I was thinking about that one day and I thought thought about my eardrums and I was like my eardrums are sympathy they're sympathizing with sound so when sound comes they start to vibrate to to to to give me the information of what I'm hearing they're sympathetic to the vibration now for that tuning fork this is the point here I'm trying to make now before I get too excited this tuning fork will not resonate unless it's the same tuning as that so that tuning fork had to come off a Master Copy and even though that tuning fork might have been down in the dumps and in a basement for many years and in darkness and maybe never used and all of a sudden it got found and it got brought into the presence of its other tuning fork and then it got vibrating and because it's tuned to it it and it was of the same material it began to harmonize without contact I was thinking today you know I was like what you know and I'm sure the children and we all have the sort Lord why do you not you know I was driving home and I thought why do you not reveal yourself and talk to me like I talk to my friends all the time and I was like Lord and I'm like in a nice way right I'm not being uh I wasn't upset or anything I'm just like Lord having a conversation because I'm like Lord I wanna come and sit with me just come and sit in my car I want to see you I want to talk to you I want to ask you questions let's have a conversation like uh you know like he's sitting there Lord what and he said I'm I'm moving in a crescendo I want the meeting to be glorious I want the marriage suffer to be amazing amen and so if we just knew him all the time in which he sat in the servant he gave hey is Jesus here and you can see him physically right and he talks you can ask him everything you want and he knows everything so he can tell you and you all the Miracles just happen easily what appreciation would you have in the crescendo of his Symphony so he spoke that to me in my heart I'm forming I'm building a crescendo here just hang tight you know don't just get ahead of yourself you will see me at the marriage supper children and my children I'm sure every child and everyone in the world thinks why is it if God is real that he doesn't show himself like that and that was what he came and I was just thinking that it's because he's actually building something here he's holding back do you think he doesn't want to see you he doesn't want to just sit with you you know what he does he sits in you but you see he's just there's just the point portion of him that he holds back until the marriage supper of the Lamb that when you're in your glorified condition you'll see him but right now right now you've got to have something to look forward to right so let's go back now I was praying a lot about what to put here because I'm about to do something that um and I thought Lord how am I going to just bring this into the right atmosphere and then this can't this scripture came in the next one now as I think brother Ben preached on it I don't know if it was Sunday or a couple of weeks ago when he talked about being in laodicea which is the seventh Church age which is the church age that we own physically the we're not exempt from the troubles we're not exempt from The Temptations we're not exempt from the spirit if you have blinkers on you will come under these Spirits because you're not being ready to fight them or to discern them when they come into your home and come into your life and come into your schedule you see your schedule is something that can be used against you as a weapon and if you don't watch your schedule I'm talking to myself now by the way if we don't watch our schedule it will grip our lives and it's like an abyss and it just takes us and it consumes us until we don't even spend time with God anymore we don't even have and when we do we're just so tense that we can't even sympathize with his Symphony that he's speaking to us who wants God to speak to them who wants to be in Revival you see your Master Copy is in Revival there's no clouds and Glory do you know that there's no clouds in heaven there's no rain Hallelujah the only rain is the reign of the Holy Ghost and it's constant and it's glorious that's where you are now if you could just come into rest and you could just really watch and discern you won't leave your first love the Lord was speaking over this church age Ephesians I think and he had nothing bad to say all the way up until here just all the good things I'm commending you for this I'm convenient they were hard workers and all of that but you see now he comes down to this but I have someone against you because you have left your first love and I just want to leave that there for now Matthew 25 5 while the bridegroom tarried now this is the foolish and wise virgins right they all so if that's his day or and that was Jesus speaking a parable then we're involved we're involved slumbered and slipped so just keep that in mind because yes we have the fullness of truth yes God has expressed the mystery of his will and he's done great things in our generation to put the bridegroom call is coming down through this message to call a bride to a Rapture right to call people from an organizational mindset and Unholy living in the church by the way and out of it to a life of Holiness a life of of life change and and a real marriage Union through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm not talking about a Pentecostal denominational baptism of the Holy Ghost that's just gifts restored and anointings but I'm talking about a personal revelation of Jesus Christ and the full measure of his loving person in you to change you to give you victory over the elements of your flesh so that you can live above sin so that when you come against any enemy you'll conquer them Glory amen no matter what comes away with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you have prevailed providing you can stay at rest and you can discern your schedule discern what you've got to do to sit in your workload because the devil will keep you busy doing good things good things even the Lord's work but are you working for God or Walking with God that stands quoting are you working for God that really like that was really striking to me are you working for him or or walking with him it's a big difference because you see all these things in these pressures and everything like that can just it starts to take us so that our I'm going to bring and introduce a new word and you're going to see what it is soon stylus right now a stylist is a little thing that goes on the record that picks up the sound wave all right and then it takes that sound wave on the record and it amplifies it you can hear the music but if that Stylus is broken or if it's gone old and it's stiff and it's not truly being able to to sympathize with the sound wave it will not be able to play this music very well will it and it might just give you a crackly representation how many of you are sitting here with a crackly representation of your sound waves of your true self of your Master Copy by the way the master copies of all LPS when they made them with a Master Copy was set in in gold gold-plated and they gold plated these things and they they did so much to them to make them last forever so this Master Copy I'll get there but first of all I want to do something I want to give you a little demo the guitarists are going to be a bit worried right now ah I don't use this one I'll use this one can I unplug this is that all right is it elf okay so oh man I'm feeling like I'm just gonna take too much time here but look now we are called see this [Music] that's actually Out Of Tune by the way [Music] it's a bit better anyway we won't worry about that but what we'll do is you see God wants to take you as an instrument in his Symphony in his orchestra right and he wants you to be in Harmony and see these strings when you pull these strings see that actually vibrates that's vibrating it's going up and down it's like a sound wave and then that one that's also a sound wave but if you go like this [Music] see it sounds beautiful see there's someone that knows how to bring out in this what's inside it the potential that's within it and it's tuned and so it's it's in harmony with the very desire of the of the musician and you could say that what's been expressed in the mind of the musician and the instrument is tuned right the instrument is in tune it's not it's not um giving a a false representation of its true self so this guitar is in its Master Copy State it's in its state where it's designed to be right and we are meant to we're designed to be tuned we're designed to be in harmony all of our strings and I did this in Sunday school so both Sunday schools know exactly what this is so I actually did this as an example and I said look when you're there's six strings of your life it's who it's you it's it's who you are and I the first one was home that's what you that's who you are at home is what you're meant to be at home school Church Church lunch which can be very different sometimes hey children they can be very Pious in church singing and then at church lunch oh my what's going on now fighting and oh man but you know this is out right and I went through these things with the children but I said and then there was um skull and sports or whatever else Hobbies by yourself that's right alone time I did alone time and that's your time where who you really are right and anyway I said now that's meant to be sounding like this tune right the purpose of you is meant to be all turned and sounding nice everything's in harmony all these sound waves are all vibrating right and watch this watch this if I had this Amplified you'd hear all these other strings now are actually starting to vibrate what they're doing is they're resonating it's called resonance because they are tuned to the same notes as these strings they will start to sympathize they will start to energize when there is an expression of the symphony [Music] the symphony if it's true if the rest of the strings are tuned they will harmonize and everything will become a beautiful sound right but what happens is life and all of it starts to I'm getting myself in trouble don't do this at home children especially mine now this is kind of how we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies right and then our lives start to go like this and so you see now people are trying to play you right [Music] God's trying to use you but this is you this is a lot of us is like this it doesn't sound very good does it [Music] doesn't sound very good so I'm going to I'm this is representing what us right so this is what sometimes this is like us really I'm going to put that there because that's where I sit so and then I'm not framing anybody I'm not saying I'm like that right now but I'm we've got the Lord's working on us but sometimes we can be in that condition where there's all the strings are out and who we are at church is not who we are at home and who we are at home is not who we are at work and we've got all these personalities I tell you what that's a very stressful thing and and we're born like that but then what God does is he says I'm going to take you and when you're born that way and I'm going to bring you back to what you're meant to be I'm going to but what you've got to do is you've got to let me do it you've got to rest in me he says come unto me all you that labor and I will give you rest stop resisting stop being stiff-necked and stop resisting the Holy Ghost and God will use you mightily and he will bring you so that you're perfectly tuned he will take that from a detuned state that's how we exist without God right and then and then what happens sometimes though is God does that for us and we get tuned to add up and we go to camp and we have an awesome time and we get a fresh filling of the Holy Ghost and you come into a Revival and then you get back out and within about six months you've just met the the world's creeping or Something's Happened in your life and you've just gotten too busy and your prayer Life Starts to wane and you or maybe you're praying and you might be praying an hour a day but it's not really quality prayer it's just dutiful prayer you're just working in prayer you're laboring you're slaving and prayer to uh fear that you're not praying enough this can happen and then you miss the essence of prayer where and then there's somebody else that prays for one minute but God comes down and it changes everything and they get calibrated every day I tell you what it's not about the the quantity it's the quality and the quality is what will tune you back because this flesh will as I'll tell you what this flesh teams up with the devil a lot the Devil comes in with a coalition government trying to to overthrow the government inside you that's a war expect it if you're baptized with the Holy Ghost expect War expect the devil's going to try everything he can to detune you and every now and again he succeeds in making us a bit detuned right and so there we are and if you want to you can put yourself there if you like we know where we're at I just want to tell you though don't leave the service like that don't leave that way you don't have to leave that way and you don't have to stay that way and you don't have to come back like that you don't have to right because I've got a name that's written up in glory and he's waiting in the heavens right your your real self your Master Copy is there then there's no clouds Hallelujah let me move on man we will never get anywhere teach my now Psalm 86 11 teach me thy way O Lord I will walk in my truth unite my heart pray it Lord unite my heart what does it bring my heart into harmony you know your heart can be desperately wicked the Bible says in Jeremiah but what if God comes in and says I'm going to take that heart out I'm going to give you a heart of Flesh you know he says I will five times and some sorry in Ezekiel 36 amen and Ezekiel serious I'm going to read that later and remember God's intention for you tonight is to unite your heart to bring your heart back into calibration he says it five times and I believe God's intention is he doesn't want us to be like that who doesn't want us to be detuned see he made you for a purpose so that you would sound beautiful he made you for a purpose that your life would represent your origin which is true sincerity by the way true sincerity is representing your origin but you see this world is just so engineered to take us away the scripture is God's Symphony yes Hallelujah only the composer knows what it really means and he now here this is one of the biggest key points of the sermon and he reveals it to those who are listening who are interested in knowing who's interested are you interested in God Symphony are you interested in the word of God we can have our own powerful intelligence and we can know everything go and do a doctorate of theology how many ministers out there in denominational world who knows everything about all the stories of the Bible but they don't even know the god of the Bible because they've got their own ideas but see and they're not even interested in the in God's composition you have to get in the spirit of the composer interested in knowing what the drama is you don't need any drama soap operas no drama TV shows you don't need that I'll tell you what storytelling we just get suckered into a story human beings but what about God's story yeah God's story is his story which is history right it's his story Symphony means an elaborate musical composition for full Orchestra typically in four movements at least one of which is traditionally in Sonata form which has three movements within a movement to develop the first thought okay and that's just beside the point but four movements and I was like wow this is interesting you see there's two symphonies in this world that's it really yeah yeah it comes from two sources there's the Symphony of God and there's the Symphony of Satan that's it and everything that you hear see feel experience is rooted in one of the two until what person are you going to yield to get your life entertainment two stylist that pinwave pick up what are you going to rest in because you can rest in entertainment and get your comfort from entertainment get your comfort from YouTube get your comfort from games get your comfort from Sports get your comfort from all these things but what move what are you going to yield yourself to because there's only two and there's four movements in each Symphony the four movements of God's Symphony Hallelujah there's the lion the ox the man and the eagle expressing God's anointing to his people to combat the devil and the the four movements and Satan is the the white horse rider the red horse rider the black horse rider and the pale horse rider deceit war and persecution economic pressure and darkness and then all three mixed together which is also seen in the Kanga worm the Locust the Palm room and the caterpillar so you see the devil's got his Symphony with his movements to destroy but God's got his Symphony with his four movements to destroy the Devil and what anointing are you going to yield to yeah what will you yield to what are you going to yield to I think that's the next scripture he said is unto what origin will you the instrument [Music] hopefully it doesn't sound like that oh we'll see we'll just see what happens know you not that to to whom I like I I highlighted whom because it's not just something it's someone yeah to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness Prophet says let's get back and get the symphony playing right let's get our instruments turned don't leave the service if there's one string of your life Unturned let God tune you he's here to heal he's intentionally here do you think that I just come up with this to speak no I believe the Lord inspired us because there's somebody in this room that needs to be tuned it doesn't matter if it's just for one person yeah and maybe it's just for me but I'm saying Lord tune me I want to be right in Juno you know you can get micro tuning too oh man and sometimes it attempts the trained here to hear that that string is just off a little bit and then you get your tree of knowledge out there and you took it on there and it's like oh yes it's a little talk off and you just and it go and you hit it it goes bing bing bing whatever to tell you it's right on hey Josh I'm like tuna right on Jesus said if I be lifted up from this Earth I'll draw all man unto me and he's the same yesterday today and forever let the directors get in the right spirit with the musicians and with the composer that's the key and this is that you could call this the expression of how God's done it for us as a people and as individuals the the whole world was groping in darkness and and the Dark Ages the church was fine and then all of a sudden the the bugs you know the devil started creeping in with the white horse rider which posed as Christ but he was deceiving and then under the red horse rider began to kill and destroy and then under the black horse rider you know NASA's over hundreds of years now under the black horse rider put a Dark Age over the church and over the True Believer and over the society as a whole and and put economic pressure through taking the money of the whole world by causing people to pray for prayers and all those things and coming under a great tyranny and the Pope the Catholic church had full control superstitiously over all the Earth the known Earth and then all of a sudden the world of the church is in is under such pressure they're hidden down in the ground completely hidden down in the Dark Ages but then God began to restore and He restored through looser many restored through Wesley just a little bit by little bit and and and and as these things restored a denominational tree grew because at every Point instead of moving on with God they they camped around their theology they took a photo of what their founder believed and that was it they never moved on and they died that's why every denomination is dead dead dead that's why they need all this the powerful music and all of the entertainment and to take away Holiness so that the people will stay can you imagine if these denominations said you guys have got to live holy and don't do any sinful things no drinking no smoking and and make them live as if they are delivered make them live as if the Holy Ghost is there they will not even stay the only way to get those churches full is by entertaining the people and giving them preaching what they want to hear so anyway this has all happened right but you see now God is expressing a symphony but you see now he has to now fully reveal everything that's in his Symphony so that the people can get in the fullness of God's spirit in the composer but the church was out of whack and I'm telling you even in all the revivals that she had she was still not quite there because God wasn't finished yeah so what does he do he now says you know what in the end time I'm going to now send a director down I'm the composer and I'm going to send a director down I'm going to send a major profit like Moses who believes Moses was a director in the time of The Exodus God used to me he even said I will you will be God and Aaron will be your Prophet I mean far out I mean how much can you elevate a man right God elevated Moses to God oh my goodness anyway I'm not doing that to our Prophet but I'm just saying that God did that right because he was a director but God sent a major prophet in the end of the seventh Church age which was William Branham a major word Prophet to what to reveal the spirit of the composer to reveal the symphony in its in its pure form so that the people and what I want to call in our Symphonies because we might as well use the Symphonies that we go there is a conductor which is what he's calling the director right a conductor is that person who's been to a symphony before you know I've been to a symphony orchestra Jonah have you been there yes I thought you had and then who who seen the conductor does the conductor just sit there like this oh it's time to go no does that conduct again in the spirit of the composer that conductor is an extension of the composer he's right into it and sing hard he's preaching the music and he's going like this and he knows he could be just as friend with Beethoven as if Beethoven's standing there and he's gunning it and he's extracted out of Beethoven's mind heart his every intention for that expression of symphony and that's just for a man what about God sending a prophet in the end time who would bring a prophet into the spirit of the composer who would preach Hallelujah the the fullness of God to the people what is that the the very conductor being sent to the seventh Church age to take a people back into the spirit of the composer and then what does he do he sets up a concert Master does anyone know what a concert Master is so a concert master in Orchestra is like the next one down from the um from the conductor and there now boss of the instruments you could say and they now is like the pastors you see a pasta has been given a jurisdiction over a local body but you see their anointing is to connect them to the um I mean these terminologies conductor oh mate my brain the conductor is connected to the concert Master the pastors are connected to the conductors so that they can see and they're Anointed with the same anointing to get the people in the spirit of the composer to keep the people moving in the symphony Hallelujah and there's obviously other Ministries as well but we're not going to go down that route so we have these times of the Symphony of God's word that the whole drama changes you who are interested listen for that chain you see there's someone that's in the orchestra if you know right now now it's we're not now it's not pastas it's not conductors it's not directors it's composer and you what are you doing you're now sitting in the orchestra now and you should know right because you're connected to that conductor you're seeing them you're you're connected to the the spirit of the composers by what God has done for you by what God has done is provided for us a whole setup here so that we can be in the spirit of his great Symphony right and now those who are interested are listening for the change are you listening for the change Malachi are you listening for the change Debbie oh yeah please don't talk to me please don't look at me Andy are you listening for that change right there's this desire to know and to know that it's coming does everyone know there's a change coming is everyone excited by the change that's coming has everyone stirred up in faith because there is a change coming and lives are going to change and we're going to receive new body Hallelujah those that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with those that are dead in Christ and we shall be going to be with the Lord forever right so there's a change coming and we know then the sheet music is beating out are you in the Rhythm how you are you eyeballing that that conductor amen I'll tell you what I was at the Wellington Symphony Orchestra and me and Becca got to sit behind the orchestra and you really get a whole new perspective all I've ever seen is this you know you're behind the conductor and he's doing this and this and he goes like listen does these things but when you're on this side which is where you're meant to be now he's looking he's eyeballing and he's connected and they can see his facial expressions and he's going come on and he's doing all these things and there's a lot of micro Expressions going on God wants you to see them yeah he wants you to see his micro Expressions he wants you to get in the spirit he wants you to be interested in a symphony Hallelujah I tell you what you can make yourself interested in the symphony but that can be alongside all these other things that you're doing all these other interests that you have all these other hobbies that you perform all these other sports that you play all these other things that you have busied your schedule with and God's just part of it he wants to be all of it that doesn't mean you have to give up everything I'm just saying he wants to be the very essence of your being he wants you to be in such a place that you're listening for you know it's getting close you hear the way the drums are beating amen you want something to happen who wants something to happen right now who wants Revival in their lives who wants a life change who wants their children saved who wants Revival in their home who wants Revival in this church why don't you just go and give God praise and ask for that Revival and call on his name and listen for that change because the beat music is about to change soon and things are happening and it's an exciting time let me say who knows what a crescendo is quiet and there's not much seemingly going on in the symphony then all of a sudden you hear these the drums [Music] and then and the triangle man gets his place Hallelujah The Triangle Man goes Ding and all of a sudden there's a people that are excited because you knew it was coming yeah that's why God begins to reveal things to you before it happens so that you can get excited Hallelujah unfortunately there's still people that are sitting there and they'll go I what's going on here what's happening you know and they're not really interested and I've been at orchestras and you know a lot a lot of the people are just there because their children are playing in the orchestra so they don't even but then there's people that have paid for those tickets hey man and God wants you to give your life and if you give your life I'm telling you if you give your life you will receive the excitement of the symphony and you will want something to and it will be a good thing Hallelujah you know this is a change see it's going to break out oh my who's watching I just talked about Wellington's Orchestra for we which have believed do enter into rest as he has said as I have sworn in my wrath that they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world skip down to verse 7 Hebrews 4 7 it gives again he limited a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it has said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart you know the word Harden means to become obstinate and to become hard to become immovable to not anything you might be hardened towards the devil but you also can be hardened towards God too you've got to be Discerning on what you're hard towards yes we should be hard towards the devil of course we should resist the devil and he will flee but don't keep everything hard don't Harden all your heart and elements of your receptacle the way that God can speak to you don't run don't have a stubborn frame standing there you're hearing preaching day of week after week and when it comes down to your house when it starts to come down into your thought processes and you think oh that brother's just preaching at me and you Pitchfork it over to the next guy or the next gal but actually it's for you and what God is wanting you to do is to take your stylist and dip it into the sound wave take your stylist and begin to read not read up here I'll tell you what I'm going to do something sooner you're going to be like that's interesting it's right now man the Lord is leading see this here I'm not going to tell you what it is because Isaac will never let me hear the end of it but he says I'm a man that likes comfort well I better tell you because you might start thinking it's crazy something but it's actually a massage gun and it does this right and we're talking about pulsation right we're talking about vibration so I'm just going to put it on medium so this thing here right now this is an expression this thing is expressing a vibration now I'm going to say that this this is expressing now I mean it's very rudimentary and God forgive me for comparing his Symphony to this but for the purpose of our little physics lesson here and spiritual physics lesson should I say we're going to say that this is God's Symphony right now lit I was playing around with this for a long time I was like oh I put my finger on I was like oh wow my finger is totally resonant with the vibration of this massage gun and I started you know I mean I I got a sermon from there I started like you know because I was like oh well anyway so this is how God wants us to be right this is his Symphony this is you he wants you to be upright and totally resonant totally sympathetic totally harmonizing totally in the same vibration as your theophany totally is your master copy dipped in resting in him so that you can vibrate the moment you try you'll be a Sarah and your producer what and Ishmael you don't want to produce an Ishmael by you trying your hardest and working for God all the time and not walking with God he wants you to be like this if you're like this you're going to vibrate at the same frequency as him your instrument's going to begin in tune right so you're not going to sit in the church and you're D tune like that and that's why you don't say too much or do too much because if you do you're scared that people are going to hear how bad you are and all this and condemnation that and falling away this and everything all that's going on inside of mind but why not just rest tonight why not let God do this but you see the problem is some of us are like this and I thought you know when you're like this see that I'm actually causing this is like semi now this is many of us many of us sit in church and we're like this we're kind of halfway there see that I'm actually it's fine I am vibrating but I'm not fully sympathetic that's fully sympathetic there's no resistance a lot of us are like this and it's because we just can't get in the spirit sometimes by the end of the service we can finally just get freed but we've had a week of all these trials and things and we've turned up and we're and we're at -5 and we get by the end of the service we might be minus one or zero but what about turning up to service at zero and coming up to plus ten in your walk with God and actually growing in the grace of God but you see now there's people that are sitting in the service like this and you're sitting there trying your hardest to resist the Holy Ghost and you see your obstinate you've hardened your heart you're not sympathizing with the word or you're sitting in church and it's all intellectual there's no it's full resistance see that but in your heart I'm fully resonating actually feels quite good does everyone get that now if it's the devil Symphony see the problem is if we're like this with the devil Symphony we probably won't be in church or we're sitting here because our parents have made us sit here and we're resonating with the devil notice it's gone red interesting [Laughter] and this is some people sitting in the church forced to be here and then if you were like that to the Lord this is you of the devil too because you've got a bit of devil stuff going on in your life and you've taken his Hollywood shows and YouTube and you've just let things slip into your life but tonight and that's detuned you so you're sitting in the Pew and you like that guitar but let me just tell you God's intention for tonight is that you don't stay that way God's intention tonight I have to look at the time I don't even know what the time is okay we're stopping God's intention tonight bigger Miri is that you're not like this because if you're like this you're sitting in two camps and you could be filled with the Holy Ghost and still you're entertaining the wrong things or you're not letting God take you on the next part of your journey that next Deliverance that next healing that next thing in your life that next hittite or high bite or jebusite that's in your land that needs to go and you're just sitting there and you're too scared to face that devil but why don't you just stand and face that devil tonight why don't you just let that let God come and bring you so you can do this to the devil see that now the devil might come into your mind but remember you can't stop the thoughts from coming over but you can stop them from Landing we've talked about our Master Copy and Glory you see this analog recording here this is the first way they recorded so here's a big trumpet thing this is actually the they've remade it obviously but this is how they recorded for the first proper recording that could actually have intelligible sound so this was a big cone and it goes all the way down to a little tiny stylus diaphragm that perfectly picks up well not perfectly not as good as today's recording but it wasn't that day good enough for them to take it right and when the sound wave is singing into that he's not being sick it looks like a sick Bowl it's like sorry I've had a lot of those experiences in my car anyway so he's singing into it and playing his guitar I think there's the speakers behind him so that's going into that trumpet all the way down to a little diaphragm there that's vibrating the all the sound waves that's going in there is going onto that little thing and it's vibrating and it's actually etching into this wax cylinder which is spinning around and creating all these micro sound waves all the way around this thing and that thing moves to the right and Spins at the same time and it writes the real true sound wave into the wax isn't that interesting yeah yeah I'd put that up there because I you need to be soft yeah that's right maybe you're a little bit hard or maybe you've just gone through so much in your life and and God wants to just stop you you know that song soft in my heart to receive oh man it's been a year since we've sung it and I don't even know how to sing it but it's a song it softened my heart to receive let me be filled with oil you know sometimes we just get so busy and we get so calloused and we get so our heart is just apprehensive all the time and we're always looking forward to the next thing and we're not enjoying the moment that we're in and right now there's a moment for you to actually have God soften your heart so that you can be a recorder and then the master copy library this hair was a library where they had all the master copies of all the records of all these artists when they first started it and these were all sitting in gold and silver and in bronze and all these different um medals so that they could be reserved and that was the master copy library let me tell you God has got a master copy library and that's what I read before isn't it who remembers that see the stylus here that's sympathetic and that Stylus is meant to be you see this is an electron microscope of a stylus of a LP player and that Stylus is reading inside that sound wave those are real sound waves inside a vinyl disc but that disc to get etched had to be soft wax at first and it got it got itched and soft wax and the sound wave came and then that stylus came so that you could be like that stylus I want you to say Lord soften my heart let me we all want Revival right we all want to be in tune so if you want to be in tune you need to just get resting just get resting and and and let your prayer life become quality it doesn't don't get stressed and pressured by making it some big long thing and you've got to do this make it quality because that quality is going to tune you up and I'm not going to read that scripture again but I ask you that question how's your stylus how are you picking up the sound waves of your theophany of your true life of the Holy Ghost of the Symphony of God are you sincerely amplifying because I tell you what you know job he went through all his trials and maybe you're going through trials and maybe you're going through a whole lot of hardships but you see job went for a whole lot of hardships to find out a revelation of his origin so God says Where Were You job and I'm just going to speak on your Eternal condition again where were you when the sons of God shouted together and the morning Stars sang together before the world began before the world foundation of the world in God's mind up there in the Eternal Realm where you are if you're ever going to be there in eternity that you're already there right how's your amplification right if you get dipped into that sound wave it's going to restore your dance it's going to restore your shout let's go when was the last time you shouted in church or if you're just sat there and said well what's stopping you from shouting yeah yeah I know probably you'll probably say our camp probably say Camp I shouted right is that right can I be honest I haven't heard much shouting going on in here for a while you know where's your Shout you shouted before the world began yeah yeah I've heard you shut I have amen it just comes out eh you can't help it you don't it comes out by the time it's out you're like oh I shouted but what is that that's an amplification right so that stylist gets dipped into the sound wave why to amplify and if your stylus is resting and you're in a good place with God and you're not this you're going to want to shout because you know that you're happy to shout and your shout ain't gonna sound like that it's going to sound good because it's from the Lord it doesn't have to physically sound good right but spiritually you know someone could just go Hallelujah and then the Revival break out right the whole Welsh Revival started from one girl getting up praise God right be glorified of me what was that a shout she heard from her theophany she heard from her origin where was she before the world began the sons of God shouted together so if you shouted then why not now amen so I'll just say how is your stylist how's your stylist God says this sorry I I mean you know we've already gone a bit long but I just have to finish this two more scriptures a new heart also will I give you remember your heart is also vibrating right it's resonant it's a frequency so a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will I like this amen take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will God see loved his rone he loves you because see what he's giving to them he give to you first this is for you now so don't just make it Israel make it yours because it's a spiritual Israel inside you it's the Holy Ghost the land is in you you are the land and the land and the god of the Holy Ghost is a new right and so now he's this is his intention so if this is not you and I was praying with myself I'm like Lord I feel like I've got stones in my heart you know I feel Stoney sometimes I feel like there's just things going on in my life and I'm struggling here and and I just know that the Lord is dealing in my life right and he's working in my life but you see God says I will put a a new spirit within you and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you amen four five I Wills so if God says I will five times it's the number of Grace right don't you think God wants to do this to you yeah don't you think God wants to give you a new heart don't you think God wants to take out the Stony heart and give you a real heart of Flesh that can vibrate in the frequency of who his Symphony right remember this if he gives you that heart when he begins to sound you will begin to resonate amen because you see that as we went to those tuning Forks before that tuning fork and that one was the same tone it began to resonate but if that Journey fault was not a 440 it would have not resonated even without touching so God yes we don't physically see his his copper body but yet even though we can be apart like that physically speaking we can still resonate with him if we're tuned to him and I ask God I said Lord what does it mean to be tuned and he said you've got to be interested interested you've got to be interested that's why the prophet says for those that are interested in the change they begin to resonate and what does that do that's their stylist they begin to get in the spirit they begin to pray in the spirit they begin to sing in the spirit they begin to church in the spirit who's ever churched in the spirit before Oh my God oh my you sit there and you get in the spirit because you're churching in the spirit Hallelujah that's what makes the change you can church out of the spirit and you're like that you know remember it's kind of half there you're kind of agreeing or you're here and it's just right and because you're so tied up in your heart there's so much stuff going on your affections are spread thin and what's happening oh Lord help me Lord we want Revival I wanted in my life but Lord what you know you you pray these things Jenny sung that as well and I thought wow praise the lord we want that well the Lord is giving us away Hallelujah oh my I want to just remember this testimony back in the prayer meeting years ago a couple of years ago a few years ago now and I just felt share of this is because this God's intention is that we are not held bondage by any complex or any fear or any um issue in our relationships right he wants us to be able to be a good friend he wants us to be able to be a good husband a good wife a good brother a good sister son and daughter right he wants us to be to function so we were in remember who remembers this prayer meeting we had out in Pokemon and um Ben was preaching it was only like a five minute he used to do like a five minute sermonic type of thing before prayer meeting and then and this one was incredibly anointed and fiery and I was sitting in the um because Malachi was only like a baby then and he was hard to get to sleep and I'm trying to get him to sleep I thought man I'm going to be stuck in here for at least 20 30 minutes but he went straight to sleep and this burden came on my heart about this that just to sit Go and sing the song in the in the um in the prayer meeting well no I don't even know to sing it but to pray it but anyway it turned into a singing but um so I I was like wow he's gone to sleep and something was like there's a reason he's gone to sleep so I went back into the prayer meeting sat down Ben stopped he prayed and then I started praying and then I sung the song and then all of a sudden the Holy Ghost just came down and it was his blood still cries freedom you say Abel's blood cried Revenge but Jesus blood Christ Freedom at Christ's deliverance and healing and so I was I've had inspired to sing that and I sung and all of a sudden they're screaming and the Holy Ghost came down Romans seen visions of this whole thing unfold and um the strubix got had amazing Divine Healing in their whole home and everything and God just rearranged things and I wanted to share that to tell you that God wants to do that to you amen it doesn't have to be a big Fantastical thing but God wants you to be tuned Hallelujah and so what it takes I'm just going to tune this guitar up I don't know if you can read that but you see this guitar need to get to its potential it needs the Ma I'm not saying I'm a master guitarist by any stretch of the imagination but I'm going to pretend to be one right now so it you see um then this guitarist potential in this person is potential but what they need is they need somebody that will care enough to bring them back [Music] you see it takes time it doesn't [Music] I'm not going to get this right but I can but I might get it to constancy see how there's someone working on this guitar to bring it that's a [Music] and then after after the Lord has worked on it you see it takes the master guitarist to or the master violinist you see in that violin you know the story how there was a violin the prophet speaks of this guy that had an auction and no one wanted it it just was this Dusty old thing in a box but then after they tried to auction it no one wanted to buy it and then an old man stepped out of the out of the audience and he picked it up and I I believe that you know violence don't stay in tune for five minutes so he would have tuned that thing and he would have tuned it and then he would have begun to play it and then people couldn't see it says here and when they did the auctioneer picked it up again and said who will make one said a thousand dollars two thousand five thousand what was the difference the master the one who knew it the one who built it he knowed how to get out of it what was in it [Music] and it's back in June so that then that you your life doesn't have to remain Out Of Tune can we have the musicians please I want to sing that song um Blessed assurance I will not be able to sing it how we sang it on Sunday that was a very different Rhythm so we'll just sing at the normal three four whatever six eight tuning or timing I'm happy with that it's been predictable but I tell you what if that was you I'm just encouraging you now don't leave this service like that let the master guitarist let the master violinist how did I go Josh did I get it back into sea [Music] you see after a while the one that can tune can hear constant C they can hear the pitch because they just know the vibration's right you know that let's just sing the song as we prepare to dismiss but let's not let this opportunity pass Us by because I believe the Lord has inspired this particular subject so that you can have a key in your life to rest and let God let go let go of those things that's pulling you down let go of those weights that are holding you and weighing you down making it hard for you to pray hard for you to walk and I'll tell you one little testimony of well it's not really a testimony it's an experienced thing that it will happen to all of us is my iPad has my Bible on it it has my notes that I write sermons on and everything so when I pick up my iPad to notes let's say previously I had YouTube open and it's got a screen of all these different videos of Science and things that I watch right and I'm now really feeling like I want to get into a study or the Lord's In Spite and I open my iPad and all I see is the YouTube app with all these interesting videos and just in the split second I see all those videos it takes the it breaks that um atmosphere because my mind now starts thinking about those and that's how quick we can be pulled away from just that quality time and even though I might just go no I'm not watching the YouTube my mind has already been tainted it I don't know if anyone's experienced that in there but that this is the thing that we are trying to be diligent right and if you want quality and you're going to go pray let me encourage you you turn your machine on or whatever you do to go read your Bible or you want to re do something on your spiritual or you want to read the Bible on your iPad or whatever and you see YouTube don't watch it don't go on that Facebook you see that little icon or it's up and you see something interesting count it off spend that time with God it will pay off it might take a while for you to wean yourself off that hamster wheel of passive entertainment I'll call it a handsome because all you do is go round and round and round and round and it's dopamine into your mind and yes it's nice oh yeah yeah yeah yeah but where did it get you just to go round and round and round and round but if anyone in here wants deliverance from that if anyone here wants to be changed from that when we pray I want you to just enter that into the Lord and place that at the foot of the cross if anyone in here has got a hard heart or they feel like they're just not on that's part of the spectrum at the moment but they're kind of there or maybe you're there and you need to stop resisting and it's time for you to become to be truly sympathetic and empathetic and to resonate with the word maybe it's time then you lay there lay your life down amen hallelujah let's just sing the song but before we sing just play it nice and soft um Blessed Assurance let's just pray on just close your eyes and um we're just going to pray and commit these things to the Lord Lord Jesus father is so grateful to you Lord lord it's been a long time coming Lord this thought and this sermon that you've given us Lord but father I believe that you inspired this tonight to reveal that your heart is towards us and that you're for us and that you don't want us to be detuned you don't want us to be stubborn you don't want us to be distracted Lord you want us to be interested you want us to have a desire for your Lord that's pure and and and full and Rich not just waning or hanging on for dear life Lord and maybe someone in his hanging on for dear life there's one little thread left that's holding them in church but tonight Lord Jesus I pray that you would reach down your hand and that you would grab that son but you'd grab that daughter and the strong hand that just like when Billy Paul was falling and the strong hand came down lord and grabbed him and and rescued him and arrested a fool maybe a fool needs to be arrested tonight Lord I pray that you would arrest the fall of our prodigals of our children that are out there Lord but don't know what they're doing and they're stuck May their life Lord not work at all but may Lord you turn them towards you and may they come to themselves in the pig pen of the world but Lord Jesus even in here tonight Lord father heal hearts Lord Jesus [Music] heal us father soften our hearts to receive may we be like that stylist Lord that heard the music and begin to write and begin to express what it was hearing it was a clear representation Lord there was no resistance Lord and father there may be resistance in our life while resisting the word or resisting Lord Jesus father the the the the word that's come to us or maybe it's conviction Lord but I pray Lord for a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost conviction in our lives Lord that you would bring us to a point where we're so interested in your word father just bring Revival Lord bring restoration Lord let your word go forth now I commit it to you I commit the people to you Lord I believe there's people in here Lord Jesus that are going to walk out changed I'm going to go to have Revival in their life that are going to tap into their lord the their true Master Copy Lord I pray that you would express your great Symphony tonight Lord and Lord reveal Lord father the keys that we need personally to come into that Revival in Jesus Christ's Name Lord I just lay these things at your feet I commit my life to you Lord I need you we all need you in Jesus Christ's name amen Hallelujah let's think of these words here Blessed assurance Jesus is my [Music] of Glory divine [Music] salvation purchase of God born of his spirit [Music] washed in his blood oh this is my story this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is my

the hands of God yielded still resting let God let God get a hold of you just tonight see what he can do see what God can do I believe he's saying just test me just see what I can do for you just let go and let me have my way in your life Hallelujah perfect submission perfect at Delight visions of rapture now burst on my sight now why because of perfect submission [Music] life only begins when you truly surrender to God [Music] happiness and joy only really starts when you truly surrender to God [Music] real Joy real peace real salvation only comes when you truly surrender to him and then you

vibration your frequencies are wrong something's going on your heart is not right not beating right and we're just going to sing that chorus one more time then we'll dismiss but as we sing it I just pray that you would mean those words with all your heart and would go beyond singing it would become a confession and you would speak it sing it by faith now let it be a rededication [Music] Lord I give you my heart I gave you my soul I live for you [Music] every breath that I take every moment I'm away Lord have your way give me Lord have your way in me God bless your Saints you're dismissed in
