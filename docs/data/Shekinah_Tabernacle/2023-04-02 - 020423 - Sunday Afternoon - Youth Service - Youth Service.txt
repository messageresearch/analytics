it's a privilege to be here this afternoon I just want to say hello and God bless you and we're in for a treat uh this afternoon so I turn the service back over to brother Kiera but yeah God bless you

um amen amen so today I wanted to talk about their reward for overcoming so let's first read a scripture in um Book of Revelations revelation 22 14 and verse 15. said um and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blizzard are they that do these Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter into the gates into the city amen and let's read another description in Revelation chapter 3 verse 21 and 22. the Bible says to him that overcometh will I grant to see it with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let them hear what the spirit says unto the churches amen let's pray almighty God we want to give you thanks for this day we want to ask you to be in this meeting Lauren please talk to me use me Lord be with us we ask you this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so um first you can you may have it now sorry I'm not I'm not gonna do a David so I want to say it's sorry to brother a man because that was a dog when I said that he he but I forgot to laugh because he told me you need a miracle to sing good and that was a joke I laughed with him but I didn't laugh when I was here because I was nervous but mama's sorry brother but I love you brother I am so um you know me a little bit so you know that I'm a happy person and I don't get this courage um easily but not everyone is like me we have people that they can get discouraged very easily so I want to talk about these rewards that we're gonna get and that we are getting too um so now um we know that we go through deep valleys and high mountains so for me I didn't enjoy the lockdown at all because uh that kept working through because I I was working at dairy farm so we didn't stop now like some of you they just stopped like two months or something it didn't stop at all I just keep working but like um one month ago I almost cut my finger I didn't cut them but I didn't chopped them off so I stayed at home for like three weeks and we spent just such a nice time with my wife and you know when the people were in the lockdown the rates of the voters went up to the roof but for us was such a good time to be together so I praise the Lord for that and also it helped me to understand why sometimes when I arrived home she was a little bit like stressed because of bad life because man she looked can look cute but she can fast [Music] but we love it so um I went to Google and I searched the definition of reward so the word we word means um a thing given in recognition of service effort or achievement so we know as Christians as we receive the Holy Ghost we're not doing anything at all it's just the Holy Ghost doing all the work yeah so for us it's it's easy when we receive the Holy Ghost so we we just need to give up the world and the pleasures of the world and embrace the cross and it came to my mind Hebrews 12. because when you know when you read Hebrew Hebrews 12 you can see all the fathers of the faith yeah and they are mentioned they're like perfect they had Faith by faith Noah his faith condemned the entire will but in the Bible also said that Noah got drunk but when it's there that sin is not there anymore he's just man no that's not there anymore amen amen so I want to give you that trophy for you because if you are here this afternoon or you are watching this online that means that you are submitting your flesh unto the Lord's will it's good we need to be honest and no who normal person would like to be here like on a Sunday you can go to fish fishing or do whatever but there is something inside of you that wants more from the Lord it actually wrote something here about um we are making a statement to the world saying that we are the Bride of God and that we cannot get enough of him we want more of him and actually remember one of the lines that brother bran preached in Chile and he mentioned the same thing here today he said we are fulfillment of a prophecy because once was said that there will be a bride and surprise here we are so if you are here you are awesome so you can take that one home today so I have a some scriptures so I'm gonna ask more is it on well if you cannot see it you can get closer if I um scripture in Matthew 20 can you read more please for the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is an household which went out early in the morning to hear sorry I can't do that to end when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day he sent them out into his Vineyard and and he labeled and and the laborers into the vineyard into his Vineyard went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whosoever is right I will give I will give you and they went their way again he went out in about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise and about the 11th hour he went out and found other standing Idol and saved unto them why Stanley here all day Idol they say unto him because no man hath hired us he say offense them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall you receive so when even was come the Lord of The Vineyard saith unto his Steward call the laborers and give them their higher begin from the last and to the first and when they came that were hired about the 11th Hour they received Every Man a penny but when the first come they suppose they suppose that they should receive more they should have received more and they likewise received Every Man a penny and when they had received it they murmured against the good man of his house saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou has made them equal unto us which have been born and burdened the Heat of the day but his but he answered unto them and said friend I do not I I do see no wrong this thou agree for me agree me for a penny but uh or is it um take that thine is and go away I will give unto the lost even unto thee it is it is not lawful for me to do what I will not with my own this thine evil eye because I am good so the last shall be first and the first shall be and the first last for many cold but few chosen thank you Mom you're gonna be a reward on Wednesday for reading that I'm gonna buy you something brother so we can see here that we are all gonna receive pretty much the same reward so if because I I know someone he was very old when he gives his life to the law and like within like one month he died and he's gonna receive the reward same as us and probably you we can feel that at all man they're reward they're just so big that we cannot be like angry because of that amen so I went to Mr Google again and I found this guy he's Randy Hagen he's a retired colonel from the USA army and I was trying to find which ones are like the medals more difficult or hard to get so he said that the the Bronze Star metal is very hard to get and is is an awarded for heroism in combat zone zone or meritorial service in a war zone it's very hard to get you need to be really Brave Also let's talk about the Silver Star metal so it's awarded for gallantry in action very hard to get and the most the middle that more hard to get is a medal of honor and it's awarded for gallantry and in trip intrepidated that's how you say that at risk of Life above and beyond the Call of Duty in the end saying so metals are not prices to be competed for and and instead a recognition for actions taken in time of work last note they are countless individual in the history of military who did as much or more than those who receive recognition but because they were too few who witnessed those actions those Heroes never receive official recognition and that's quite sad but we know that we have a God that he sees everything and everything is there it's written there so everything what you do for the law there is a record there and you are gonna receive your reward amen I found that that image that says what success looks to me yeah and that's pretty much what success looked to me so in the Bible speaks about Five Crowns that we can get and I was talking to brother Ben last night and it's not that we are gonna have five hits we're gonna receive Five Crowns that pretty much is the same one but this hits so much meaning that have different names so it's a Crown of Life The Incorruptible Crown the crown of righteousness the Crown of Glory the crown of rejoicing so you are going to have a crown because you're gonna be a king and a priest what we're gonna get there soon also in the in the seven eight churches in Revelation 2 and 3 start to speak and also give um a couple of rewards too the first one is that the right to eat from the Tree of Life second one the Crown of Life a white stone and a new name third one the hidden Mana authority over the Nations and the morning star fifth the dreaded in white never blow out his name from The Book of Life sixth a pillar in the temple and seventh sit with me on my Throne so brother we are going to receive a really big reward my brother so there is some reward that we can get here in on Earth and I like that that image that picture I can feel it like Bella when I hold her because she doesn't have to worry about anything I we have to provide for him we we just take care of her and I think that's the way that the Lord look at unto us so here there's some attribute of God Jehovah Jireh means the Lord will provide a sacrifice he's our provider and I have a it's not like a big one but I I love this example because when I start to work for Isaac in Andy I went there to the factory and I went to Market and get it quite close and I saw this earmuffs that it had Bluetooth too so you can use the Air Max and listen music or a sermon or whatever I didn't talk to Isaac but I saw them and I was like man I really want to give them but I didn't have the money because they were like 150 bucks I didn't say anything I just keep working and then Isaac he went to miter 10 and came back with the box and said look what I bought you and I was like man so shocked that the Lord just revealed to him whatever I wanted this something so small but to me meant it means hips you know also I remember also yeah like one year ago I said I prayed to the Lord in my car because that way I have my own revivals when I'm driving to work and come back so I said to the lord I can't provide for my family I'm not doing it so I want you to provide for my family and from then on pay rise and everything and I were like so happy I never talked to Isaac about pay rights or anything it's just the Lord talking um talking to him amen the another attribute of God is Jehovah Rapha it means the Lord that healeth thee and we know that he's our healer another one is Jehovah it means the Lord is present and that's where I have my my own Revival driving the driving the car in the morning listening the song in this this sometimes I am just driving the internet just start to cry don't know why it's just the Lord is here with me amen the Lord is our peace Jehovah Nissi the Lord Jehovah the lover is my shepherd is that how you say that Raw Raw Jehovah the Lord without righteousness so the law is everything to us so in according to receive all these um rewards we need to go to the basic so we need to go to the beginning of everything so to receive other words we really need the Holy Ghost so that's the first one and we know how to receive the Holy Ghost because it's like quite like instruction repent be baptized and you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so once we have the Holy Ghost is that everything is on track we are on Wheels it's nothing can stop us just pretty much we made it yeah amen so we can read here can you can where's the mic can you give the mic to Ruben please and I have another scripture here in John 14 verse 25. can you read it please these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the Comfort which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to you remember um to your remembrance who who's over I will send unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid amen so once we receive the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost start to work in our life and start to change everything from the inside out amen so that's very important to receive the hood that's very important in terms of the Holy Ghost another of the rewards that we can get that we are gonna get is a body change and I have they're quite cool dude there the one over there it's Brother Andy when he was young were you like 20 something second one is brother Isaac and there's been a Christian I'm assuming that you were like early 20s right yeah so our bodies needs to be transformed it's quite funny because sometimes I I put myself like in the in the young group but I'm not young anymore the other day there was a little girl that said to me and I was like [Laughter] can you give the microphone to Jonah please to read this scripture it's in First Corinthians 15. is it as is the Earthly Searcher they also there are Earth earthy and as is the Heavenly such are the are they also there are Heavenly and as we born the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this I say prison that that fresh and blood cannot enter inherit the kingdom of God Amen neither does corruption and and hear it in corruption behold I assure you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed Amen in a moment in the thinking of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed for this for this corruptable must be must put on in corruption that and this Mortal must put on immortality so when we win this corruptable shall have put on in corruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to us that's the saying that is written death death is swallowed up in Victory the way as they sting oh grave where's thy Victory The Sting of death or sin and the strength and of sin is the law but thanks to be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast and movable always about abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in a in vain in the Lord amen it's not in vain we're going to be rewarded amen so I had a quick chat with Andy and brother um been well they were having lunch and I asked them about the body change because from now on it's going to sound like I'm trying to sell you something like a Salesman because it's just so many awards and they are just so good but they are in the Bible so I'm not trying to sell you something it's just there okay so that when when we get the body change it's a Immortal body right cannot diet we're gonna be young again we're also going to have the spoken word right to call things into existence so we can create planets so if if you have seen any um comic or something about a hero that can be here because you're gonna have power you're gonna have power you it's gonna be awesome amen also I have a quote here it's brother Branham saying well the church has come through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost give manifested to it and now what the spirit of God moving in the church doing the same works that Jesus did before he lived as a promise and what's the next thing the change the next thing happened to Abraham was a body change he had to change it and he never got the Sun they were written right and the next thing happens to the church is a rapture will have to be changed and caught up in the air to meet him we can't meet him on Earth with God to go in the air to meet him it's a it's a coming it's the coming Sun the promised son amen we've looked for him now for a hundred of years we will he will come someday but the next thing for the church it's to be changed we had every sign justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit placing of Islam manifestation of the spirit now what the changing of the Body for the Rapture that was on the 61. so how much clothes we are now to receive the the body change so once our bodies change we are gonna proceed with the rapture amen so if we read here in first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 says for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of Archangel and with the Trump of God and the death in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the law in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with this word amen man what a statement so we're gonna receive our Lord I have another um word for um for the Rapture that I talk in Tauranga once um if I can find it no I don't have it but the way was extraction and in the military um like thing extraction it happened when everything is just so bad that there needs to go there to rescue the people and take them to a friendly uh environment and that's what we are waiting for we we really need an extraction because this is just getting so bad my brother so once we received the Holy Ghost um our bodies is gonna get change we can be we can became Kings and priest amen so if we read um Revelation 1 says um verse five and from Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and watched us from our sins in his own blood and hath made as Kings and Priests and Queens I'm going to head there unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen so yes you're gonna be a king all of you you're gonna be Kings and I listen once in the same like when you are a king in when you're like in a royal family there is so many things that they are waiting for you to to achieve you know back in the days you had to be good with the soul and you have to be smart and do heaps of things and remember everything that you do you are a king and there is some things that they are not good for a king to do you are a king so you have to live with the thing in your mind okay the next thing if we are Kings and Priests we're gonna need a city so here we have the Golden City the New Jerusalem I didn't put a scripture with um how glorious is this it is going to be about the stretch of gold and this is the Sea of Crystal the crystal sea and the Gate of pair so it's going to be awesome so can you can you pass a mic to someone with some man they're helping me so much thank you guys can you read this in Revelation to the first Out of Heaven prepared prepaid as a bride adorned for her husband he that overcometh shout and hear all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the album abominable and murderers and one more humongous and sauce saucers and I don't I'd adulterers and all liars shall shall have their part in the lake which burned with fire and brimstone which is the second death hey man so we are gonna have the good side of that thing we are not gonna be cast turned amen I'm asking the kids to read because I can't read all English that's the truth to be honest I can't so we go we're gonna be king priest we're gonna have we're gonna live in the holy city so we need a kingdom and that kingdom is going to be the millennial Kingdom where everything is going to be restored to the first state so this Earth is going to be burned and everything is going to be back to the to the original and there is a scripture here in Isaiah 65 saying the wolf and the lamb shall fit together and the lion shall eat straw like the Bullock and that shall be the syrup and meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountains saith the Lord amen that's waiting for us when I'm about to finish now and the last one that I wrote here there is many many other ones but I just put the ones that that I like the most so here's the eternity with our creator so here in Revelation 21st we can read and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow no crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he hath you know he can someone read that thing please guys and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me I done it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is artist and of the Fountain of water of Life freely he that Overcomers shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son amen what a beautiful thing is that one yeah gonna be forever with our Lord so just here almost to finishing Matthew 6 said um late not up for yourself Treasures upon Earth this is our Lord Jesus Christ we're moth and rust does corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven where neither moth not rust death corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor still for where your treasure is they will your heart be also amen so for the last one I just change the title for their rewards for overcoming because it's not only one there is many many rewards that we can get and I wanted to speak to you about this just to encourage you that man it's we just don't come to churches to be good we are going to be reward my brother and sisters so God Bless you that's all what I have for you today so Amen brother you can come back raise the law God bless you brother Jimmy thanks for the word as with the Dave's gonna come up we're just going to sing above all powers [Music] [Music] above [Music] all those [Music] foreign [Music] part of me [Music] the man foreign [Music] but there's no way please [Music] thank you because [Music] crucified lay behind the storms [Music] and put on the ground we took before and he thought of me [Music] about his and close your eyes the only father I was thinking come here deal Jesus and Lord I pray that um the Lord this will just be a blessing to Heavenly Father and that people will just be blessing you dear Lord may we just leave rejoicing and comforting Your Love losing Grace pray just be our portions to be with each and every one of us Mary leave here overcoming is the Jimmy says Jesus Christ in our prayer amen amen God bless everyone just into the word we'll go to the second chapter of Joel and go to chapter 32. and it says here and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in the Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord hath said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call amen so anyway have your seats amen my title of the sum anism deliverance and it's just so this is just sort of tied in with my testimony but I'm going to move through it quite quick so just pay attention so I've been brought up in the message of my whole life I was also homeschooled we lived on a massive block with that backed onto dockland so the Lord has blessed me an ability to do heaps of pig hunting and brother matu actually got me into that thank goodness so that was the definitely the highlight of my teenage years I was and I was a young man at the age of 13 I was a young boy serving the lord so now I was really going strong and then yeah head catching his pigs um and I like to go to Genesis 37 verse three I'd like to just type my life to the life of Joseph then it's not exactly the same obviously but you're right you can get certain um similarities and and if you know every type of life with the peoples in the Bibles um now it says here now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of a sold age and he made him a coat of many colors so you know if things were going well for Joseph he was obviously the favorite Child you know and I was definitely you know I was definitely the the proud son of my dad and my dogs and stuff so you know we're quite some of it we're doing doing quite good um and brother Branham says here I've got a quote when he tried Bailon when he tried to kiss Israel he blessed Israel and black asked them why he said How can any Prophet say anything less God put it in his mouth see you can't say it there's no need amen so even the Devil Couldn't get to me at your nose and I was doing good but he did um at 14 I started going into the world I managed to get the access of the internet password without my parents from motion I started watching evil movies listening to ungodly songs begin watching pornography I started complaining about being homeschooled saying that I had no friends that I wasn't cool I started to despise my family as I didn't you know want to be around them in public because they had long hair and long dresses and stuff you know that grants us grants us the reward you know of it he didn't want one um and I became very embarrassed and no longer wanted to go to church pray or read my Bible and in Genesis 37 23 it says and it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his Brethren that they stripped Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and cast them into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it so if I could type Joseph's to mine it was like Joseph that has Brothers was carnal nature you know same with me my Cardinal nature sort of got a hold of me and I started you know doing all these things of the flesh that the flesh wants to like you know watch all these movies and all this stuff and these even movies and these ungodly songs I know the flesh desires it and you know so I got thrown into this pit um and then brother Brown says here there's been two dogs uh this was a the chief brother man speaking to achievement Chief says there's been two dogs and me and one of them is a black dog and one of them a white dog and said they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad said well Chief which one of them wins the fight said that depends on which one she feeds the most and men's I was definitely not feeding the white dog and at 15 I started working full time in a flooring company that dad and brother Andy started I started smoking was some help of the dodgy workers that was there and then started to you know just roll my lungs so I was making piganding harder for me to do and and it started to enter my money so I was kind of running out of money um and then Genesis 37 28 then there passed by midianites merchantment and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt so Joseph was really you know starting to run out of Hope you know and same with me you know I you know I was now addicted to something like completely adducted into this evil thing of smoking and this evilness and you know um and yeah at that point if I died I probably I would have been going directly to hell um but I like that thing you know um a pardon is only um a pardon if you're accepted as a part and say no church was all still here and everything but I didn't want to accept it I mean um the other man says and every man is deserving of how you're born and Sun shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies there's nothing good about us to begin with and then at 16 I got addicted to drugs I started hanging out with the wrong crowd I stopped going to church and I completely forgot about God um Genesis 37 36 and the midianites sold him unto Egypt under potiphar and officer of pharaohs and captain of the Guard so now as the same with me Nino has Joseph's his family was gone he was an evil place with unbelievers and you know I was likewise you know I was all my family was gone wasn't hanging out with him anymore and I was surrounded by these unbelieving people who were the wrong crowd um and then at 17 all I wanted to do was join a gang I then met an Iraqi man who was getting patched up for the black power in three years when a patched up member got out of Princess like someone who's like in it for life and he's got his his pieces of Pride on that's really going to get him nowhere but anyways that's that's all that's all is that's you know that now what he lives for um I of course I could no longer stay at home I was forced to move out before I left dead told me as long as I didn't serve God nothing would go well for me and I would never fit inside you know nothing well for me I think I told about the story when I crashed the van that was no good and then but anyways I didn't feel that I was hanging out with like um these I reckons who were like you know the different culture so there was always the yeah but um different um and then um and then anyways I am I moved I then moved into a flat where there were more ungodly people so I became surrounded by all these ungodly people and then also I um there was one time that I was in full driving we went across the river and anyways our truck ended up getting washed out it was midnight and I was all on drugs and stuff and I ate all my you know big puffer jacket uncle's real cold shoes lace-up shoes and and then the truck sanked I quickly got out of the um the window of the truck before completely submerged and almost drowned because I couldn't get my puffer jacket off and I couldn't unlace my shoes so yeah and then but you know in my you know I was trying to call out for help at first you know asking everyone to come help me but no one came and then at the very end of it I started calling out to the Lord and the Lord answered no I lived so yeah but you know it's always in the yeah we want to praise the Lord and the good times and the bad times not just on the bad times um and Genesis 39 20 and Joseph's Master took him and put him in prison a place where the Kings prisoners were bound and he was there in prison but the law was with Joseph and showed him mercy and favor and the sight of The Keeper of the prison so it was like me you know even though you know I I was literally like imprisoned with you know the scan I couldn't relieve and stuff and then but still with all their Mercy you know I didn't die and stuff like that um and then brother Branham said here and yet he loved me so that he came down and saved me by his grace nothing I deserved or could do but he saved me because before the foundation of the world was he predestinated me to be saved amen so the Lord the Lord you know after that the Lord sort of almost started to work and I I got kicked out of my place in Gelson and then I got put into this motel and um had an awful awful time in the eye actually got a little green card and that's you can only buy food with that it was very very limited and anyways before the lockdown hit I I could buy food and a little bit of drugs for that and for that I lost the green card and then lockdown had all the food prices went real high so I I was like I won't give eye drugs or give up the food so I basically stopped eating so I got real hungry and it was awful and all I could watch was shortland Street worst TV show ever ever um I mean that might be in hell now it probably won't but hey it's gonna be something like that um and then anyway so I I think I'm dead I was like hey dude can I please move back home you know I can't I'm not really doing too good here can't eat anything um and then I um yeah I moved back moved back and with dad started working for him again and and my 18th birthday I know my worldly friends I have all these big people that beat up each other they must have thought I was a bit weak so none of them like me and then at my 18th birthday none of them were there so I spend a year with these guys and they're all gone and all that was there was um my family you know Ben Bailey um but you know I was still you know still um and then yeah I really wanted wanted uh to you know wanted us to seek the Lord and obviously go to heaven and stuff and then that down mom painted the painting ages ago and it had like a headwind dead and we were looking which was showing the back of us and we're looking across an ocean toward the sunrise and we're staying on a beach and um anyways I could I've never seen it for my life but when at this moment I seen it there was like a breach between me and my dad I was like well you know Dad's going heaven and I'm going hell and that really scared me um and then we went to the I'll uh we had to go to the otaki camp the Family Camp and um [Music] they were going to kick me out of the house for four days and lock me outside so I thought oh I'll come um and I I got really blessed there just there was an absolutely awesome awesome time I mean make sure your kids go to those camps yeah um Genesis 43 29 and he lifted up his eyes and saws by the Benjamin his mother's son and said is this your younger brother of whom you spake unto them and he said God be gracious to thee and Joseph made haste and his bowels the Dune upon his brother amen so I was the same with me you know Joseph you know I came back and something was different about my family truly truly different um and same with Joseph you know there was obviously a new person they'd never met before in his family when he saw he saw them again so you know and he was quite sad and I was also quite sad you know because I didn't want to yeah I wanted to you know go go see the Lord and Glory not burning hell um I mean um brother Branson is here he loves us before we loved him he loves us as I've said no man seeks after God God seeks after man so then the Lord started to seek after me after that camp and after I was really blessed and then I was I think I told you guys before but I was in the van and I got I got filled with the Holy Ghost while I was listening to Amazing Grace I mean and then after that the Lord helped me quit all the evil addictions or all the evilness that I was doing and then not long ago I was actually in at brother Andy's place in the in his little room downstairs and I had a vision and the Lord told me to go to Indonesia so I believe that's my calling I
