[31:11] amen
[31:14] amen um God bless you all good evening
[31:18] it's a Wednesday night and always
[31:20] excited um hopefully I'm the only one
[31:23] here nervous thank you musicians thank
[31:26] you so much for
[31:28] playing really nice songs um with my
[31:32] thought that I have the the songs really
[31:34] I think fit you you you might wonder how
[31:38] and I will now deliver that message of
[31:41] how
[31:43] um let's turn to our
[31:46] Bibles um ecclesiastics
[31:49] 4 from verse
[31:53] n a little bit small there on the
[31:56] projector forgive
[32:01] me Ecclesiastes uh 4 vers
[32:09] 9-2 two are better than one because they
[32:13] have a good reward for their labor for
[32:15] if they fall uh the one will lift up his
[32:19] fellow but woe to him that is alone when
[32:22] he falleth for he had not another to
[32:25] help him up again if two lie together
[32:29] then they have heat but how can one be
[32:32] warm alone and if one Prevail against
[32:35] him two shall withstand him and a
[32:37] three-fold cord is not quickly broken
[32:41] amen and quickly just turn to Genesis
[32:44] 2:18 if you don't want to turn there it
[32:46] is there on the slide and the Lord God
[32:49] said it is not good that the man should
[32:51] be alone I will make him an help meat
[32:54] for him you may have your seat seats God
[32:57] bless the reading of his word and um I
[33:01] just speak through me so my my thought
[33:04] tonight um I thought tonight is
[33:08] basically
[33:10] lonely or
[33:13] alone
[33:14] so they they uh the world out there us
[33:18] as Believers we use this um
[33:22] uh let's break it down let's go into the
[33:24] definition of of of lonely right lonely
[33:28] being without company cut off from
[33:31] others or
[33:32] solitary not frequent frequented by
[33:35] human beings so desolate right so it's
[33:39] now starting to paint a grim picture or
[33:41] an it's got a little bit of a negative
[33:44] connotation to him to itself sad from
[33:47] being alone or
[33:49] Lonesome and the example right at the
[33:51] bottom is he was feeling uh lonely
[33:54] without his wife and children I'm
[33:55] feeling very lonely without my my wife
[33:57] tonight please keep her in prayer she's
[34:00] not feeling well and um as she
[34:03] strengthen
[34:04] on alone is not that bad separated from
[34:09] others or isolated so we had desolate in
[34:11] the first one here we have isolated
[34:13] exclusive from anyone and anything else
[34:16] or only she alone knows what happened
[34:19] you know when you get come come to the
[34:22] kids you know you he it's very quiet
[34:25] very silent we have three Rowdy boys and
[34:27] it's all of a go all of a sudden silent
[34:29] you go something's up and you come
[34:33] around the corner and they pointing
[34:35] fingers who did what he only knows what
[34:39] happens it was not me was it we we don't
[34:41] know
[34:43] right considered without reference to
[34:45] any other the children alone would eat
[34:48] that much we know a few people that can
[34:51] eat
[34:53] much right so so looking at lonely it it
[34:58] paints a bit of a grim picture and a bit
[35:00] of a a negative connotation to it alone
[35:03] alone is I won to say positive but it
[35:07] paints a more positive picture and a
[35:09] more neutral picture
[35:13] where where we can where we can
[35:17] enjoy ourselves alone if I can put it
[35:21] that way I don't want to skip too much
[35:25] so um alone I'll I'll dive into alone
[35:28] very quickly now maybe I'll start this
[35:31] way in my life
[35:34] um I I think as a as an individual as
[35:39] Edan I've never ever felt lonely so I
[35:43] can put it out there on record um I've
[35:47] never been
[35:49] depressed um I've never had a Time lot
[35:54] of times where I was misunderstood still
[35:56] today that that's fine it's how I speak
[35:58] you know um what I think and and and how
[36:01] I do um act on and react but I was never
[36:05] lonely so I was never desolate I was
[36:09] never feeling no one can get to me I'm
[36:12] I'm I'm absolutely out and and there's
[36:16] no hope for me I can't get there so I'll
[36:18] put that now on record that it is hard
[36:22] for me um my personality and character
[36:26] to enter into someone's burden that I
[36:29] would say is lonely right but I was the
[36:34] only child for about almost 8 years and
[36:38] I grew up alone so alone don't have a
[36:42] problem with being alone um ask my
[36:46] wife I could be in my nothing box all
[36:48] alone within a big crowd and and I'm
[36:51] just I'm I'm content I'm happy so alone
[36:54] you know you you you start imagining
[36:56] things you can you I had a big
[36:58] imagination maybe I'm I'm I'm saying too
[37:01] much now I had imaginary friend right
[37:03] and he was my Opa he was my granddad
[37:06] right Opa Yanik okay and um because of
[37:12] my imagination I had to share that with
[37:14] someone don't know why am I saying this
[37:16] now so I'll pick up the phone and I'll
[37:18] phone someone in Cape Town random people
[37:21] and I will tell them all about aiki and
[37:24] our hunting days when we hun lions and
[37:28] and I'm so convinced and
[37:31] convincing they they are flabbergasted
[37:33] who's this 5-year-old talking to them on
[37:36] the phone convincing them of op Yanik a
[37:40] and that we went hunting and you know we
[37:43] killed lion so sometimes mom would come
[37:47] no that other story I just said where
[37:49] you know when it's very silent um you
[37:51] know there's something up so Mom would
[37:53] be in the house and you
[37:54] go anyone's talking but I don't know to
[37:57] whom because it's just me and him in the
[37:58] house she comes around the corner we had
[38:00] a little study and there was that old
[38:02] phones that you know you ring with the
[38:06] yeah and she would run there and just
[38:08] pick up and hello hello and it's someone
[38:10] else on the other side of the country
[38:12] and on the line
[38:14] so I never was um concerned that I am
[38:18] alone or you know that I would be alone
[38:20] I I I don't really struggle uh these
[38:24] days they would probably call it fomo I
[38:25] guess he fear of missing out I I I can
[38:28] be alone I I'm happy and what I actually
[38:32] wanted to share here back in
[38:34] 1999 um we we did service years this
[38:38] this is that that uh counseling here
[38:41] that me and Lundy um ly and I met on on
[38:44] on this um time of our life and back in
[38:48] 99 so and one of the things that they
[38:52] Lov to do and I was so excited about was
[38:55] they called it
[38:57] Solitude now solitary confinement is
[39:00] probably a very negative connotation you
[39:02] know from a prison point of view but
[39:04] this Solitude was it's you you can have
[39:07] a little Journal you can have your
[39:09] Bible and just you all alone and that
[39:14] would that would be 2 hours so they will
[39:16] you know they will test the waters and
[39:17] see how people do two hours and then go
[39:20] to 4 hours 6 hours and at one stage it
[39:22] was eight hours so basically almost a
[39:25] whole day and and that was in clor
[39:28] somewhere in Cape Town all
[39:30] alone I thrived I loved it so I was you
[39:35] know writing in my journal and I wrote
[39:37] some poems and and you know you would
[39:40] read your Bible so I adored that time
[39:42] alone but it's not alone if you see what
[39:45] I'm going here I'm with someone I'm with
[39:48] a being I'm never alone right so this is
[39:51] the picture I want to uh paint to you
[39:54] you are never ever when you are a Born
[39:57] Again child of God you will never be
[39:59] lonely and you will never ever be alone
[40:02] am please there the this is the message
[40:05] I want to get over this ppit tonight do
[40:08] not wherever you are do not if you go
[40:11] back home and you're the only believer
[40:13] if you are on the other side of the
[40:15] world and all your family that's
[40:17] Believers whatever the situation please
[40:21] go out here tonight knowing not thinking
[40:24] not having faith kn knowing you are
[40:27] never lonely and you are never ever
[40:30] alone in this journey yes you have
[40:33] fellow Believers around you here
[40:36] but there's one Hallelujah there's one
[40:39] right so with our with our
[40:43] Prophet early on in his life young age
[40:47] and me and brother Isaac we we quickly
[40:49] spoke about that he was never alone and
[40:52] he couldn't figure out why is he not
[40:54] alone so there was this wind or he would
[40:57] do something and there was this twirl
[40:59] and this you know he would he would
[41:01] acknowledge there was something out
[41:03] there close by that would never leave
[41:05] him alone so when he when he got a bit
[41:08] naughty and when he you know he wanted
[41:09] to um shoot some of his friends or some
[41:11] of the uh the school kids um he you know
[41:15] he wanted to drink um and smoke there
[41:18] was always this thing that got his
[41:21] attention this being there's something
[41:23] out there that makes me I have to accept
[41:26] I'm not alone anymore so lay down in his
[41:28] journey he accepted it and what a
[41:31] wonderful uh uh moment that would have
[41:35] been to acknowledge I'm not alone but
[41:38] know what is that know what is that
[41:41] that's causing it me to not be alone
[41:45] right and he had it before he was he was
[41:47] baptized right so from a young
[41:50] age and what I want to bring in here is
[41:54] that in his ministry
[41:57] I believe he he would have felt lonely
[42:00] so bring a little context we had a youth
[42:02] camp and brother Michael opened up a
[42:04] little bit of um personalities you know
[42:06] certain personalities and and how
[42:09] brother Brandon um had the um oh no
[42:13] melancholic
[42:14] melancholic yeah and um how how they
[42:20] that that type of um personality would
[42:23] would easily be um I guess misunderstood
[42:27] right and early in his or in his
[42:30] ministry he would feel lonely even
[42:32] amongst the crowds and congregation so
[42:35] he would flee to get away and be alone
[42:38] so while he's feeling lonely the
[42:40] negative he's fleeing away from the
[42:42] crowds to be alone alone with who alone
[42:44] with God so so he cannot feel lonely
[42:47] anymore and then he will fellowship with
[42:49] the Lord somewhere alone alone on a
[42:52] Mountaintop and he will get his
[42:55] refilling so when we talk about alone
[42:57] here in this
[42:59] context he's running away to his
[43:03] bridegroom he's running away to get
[43:05] refilled but he wants to be alone so our
[43:08] vessel needs to be alone and shut in
[43:10] with God and I'll get there and it's not
[43:14] that far-fetched to say that our lord
[43:16] Jesus felt lonely so I'm talking about
[43:19] the negative
[43:21] connotation so here brother brandom is
[43:24] referring to and now to him
[43:26] that's able to keep you uh keep you from
[43:30] falling and to do ex exceedingly
[43:32] abundantly more than we could think may
[43:35] his grace and being anoint our meeting
[43:39] and may our faith settle down and
[43:41] imagine seeing seeing a lonely Pilgrim
[43:45] rejected of men Man of Sorrows
[43:47] acquainted with grief accused of being a
[43:50] devil a mind reader spiritualist coming
[43:53] walking along misunderstood but he was
[43:56] God's own son so Jesus felt lonely right
[44:00] he came to save he came to do a good
[44:03] deed and he was so misunderstood he
[44:06] always walked among all these people so
[44:09] many people so many different walks of
[44:11] life but within all that he would be
[44:13] able to feel lonely and alone he had to
[44:18] get he had to go and have fellowship
[44:20] with God talk to him alone talk to him
[44:24] where that Veil that drops behind him
[44:26] the prophet once told about the story uh
[44:29] I think when he went on honeymoon with
[44:31] brother uh brother with sister MAA and
[44:34] they had a little baby and uh it was a
[44:37] honeymoon so he I think he sneakily
[44:39] arranged a little hunting trip and
[44:43] um he went into the woods he left the uh
[44:47] left sister maida and the baby at the
[44:49] little um lean on I think they called it
[44:52] and and he's away and storm sets in and
[44:56] quite a devastating storm quite a
[44:57] destructive storm where they say it sort
[45:00] of you can't see almost your hand in
[45:02] front of your face you know you can't
[45:04] see what's happening in in you know two
[45:06] steps in front of
[45:08] you and as as he's explaining the story
[45:12] The Lord's also dealing with him and
[45:13] working with him and how he's walking
[45:15] now this walk and he's trying to go
[45:18] there and he gets lost and he he gets
[45:19] back to where the he shot a deer and he
[45:21] gets back to the deer and then he walks
[45:23] this way and he get he's all he's all
[45:26] clueless right but in that he's still
[45:29] talking to himself he's saying oh I
[45:31] should go there I should know I should
[45:32] know I'm a huntsman I'm a Woodsman I
[45:35] know I should know I should go this way
[45:37] so just keep the the the wind to my back
[45:40] or into my face and I'll walk this way I
[45:43] I I know and at one point where he
[45:46] confessed and he said I'm lost yeah now
[45:50] while that was happening the Lord's just
[45:52] saying I'm your strength and I'm your
[45:54] Refuge I'm your strength and I'm your
[45:56] refuge and I'm he's hearing that but he
[45:58] thinks he's he's he's becoming mad this
[46:01] coldness and you know it's freezing
[46:03] temperature Subzero it's sitting in
[46:05] maybe on him you know so he's starting
[46:07] to uh hallucinate he's starting to think
[46:11] weird things but the Lord's just saying
[46:13] I'm your strength and I'm your Refuge so
[46:16] during all that I believe he did not
[46:18] feel once lonely or alone so he knew
[46:22] that the Lord with W was with him the
[46:25] the Lord was just patient to sit there
[46:27] and say when can I have a turn I'm your
[46:31] strength and I'm your Refuge have a lord
[46:34] do you want to be alone with me you know
[46:36] he was just so patient so mindful the
[46:39] Lord and then how how he went to the
[46:43] Lord and said Not For my sake so
[46:45] selfless but for MAA for the little one
[46:49] can I get to them can I get to them in
[46:50] time because they knew sister MAA was
[46:53] probably not the a huntsman and a
[46:55] Woodsman like he was so she would have
[46:57] stressed out a little bit especially
[46:59] with a
[47:00] baby now that story I just want to bring
[47:02] into context here and and
[47:07] uh and that's the next slide
[47:12] yes yes that's the way you go to Calvary
[47:17] so he's talking about um he's walking
[47:19] now and he said if you can just get to
[47:21] that telephone wire that wire that runs
[47:23] from the um from the the Reserve um what
[47:27] do you call them uh guide a house or
[47:30] something Hut down six or seven miles to
[47:33] where this leaning his or lean over us
[47:35] and um said if you can just get to that
[47:37] wire so now he's walking he's walking
[47:40] with his hands up just imagine it's all
[47:42] foggy it you cannot see your hand in
[47:45] front of you is walking up it's getting
[47:47] freezing he's putting his gun down and
[47:49] then the other hand okay get up then
[47:52] start walking just feeling his way
[47:53] feeling his way Lord just help me if I
[47:56] get to that wire and know I can make it
[47:58] no I can make it now he's all of a
[48:01] sudden feeling that wire it bumps into
[48:04] that wire so here's now the story now
[48:07] I'm picking up that's the way you go to
[48:09] Calvary with both hands up hollering for
[48:12] mercy God directs you you don't know how
[48:15] I felt when my hand hit something I
[48:18] pulled on it and it was the wire I knew
[48:22] I could hold to that wire it would lead
[48:24] me to my loved ones What a Feeling
[48:27] to it was to know that God had helped me
[48:31] it was a relief I knew I would save them
[48:34] but it was nothing like the thrill it
[48:37] was one night when I held up my hands in
[48:39] the air until something else touched me
[48:42] my hand and my heart it was a wire of
[48:45] the holy spirit that tells me that the
[48:48] end of this road my loved ones and
[48:51] savior is
[48:53] awaiting as I thought on my ways
[48:56] I wasn't a hunter I wasn't a Woodsman
[48:59] God was my refuge and my strength and
[49:03] that is what he is he is our refuge when
[49:06] that Veil drops behind you and you are
[49:08] shut in with God you can never be alone
[49:11] but you are alone you are alone with
[49:13] this this being that's just living and
[49:17] we were just praying in the in um at
[49:19] home and I said that keep the atmosphere
[49:23] Lord because if if if you are welcome
[49:26] here death sickness the world out there
[49:31] everything has to flee he's light he's
[49:33] life and when that's there healing can
[49:38] come restoration can
[49:40] come
[49:42] um next one here and as I've been
[49:46] referring to the um the veil that drops
[49:50] be behind you this was so impactful for
[49:53] me and this is the um sermon we we

[50:02] have this
[50:04] abundance of Rich word that can just
[50:09] rush over us like like fresh water and
[50:11] mana and a man that once walks into God
[50:16] so he's walking into that holy of holies
[50:19] long gone are we now in the outer Court
[50:22] we are now walking into and not where
[50:24] that Mana can get stale in that inner
[50:26] Veil but we in that inner court but we
[50:28] walking into the holy of holies that's
[50:31] why that Veil drops behind him shutting
[50:35] off the things of the world he's in the

[55:13] on the on the um Youth Camp said he
[55:17] there's this phases in your life when
[55:19] when we become renewed vessels um and
[55:24] first we have a Stony heart I had a
[55:26] Stony heart the Lord had to replace that
[55:28] with a new heart so I had to do that
[55:31] first before he sends the Holy Ghost and
[55:34] that's why the order is there repent be
[55:37] baptized and then you will receive the
[55:39] promise of the Holy Ghost so we had to
[55:42] have this and everything is in place
[55:44] everything is in order everything is
[55:45] perfect take that Stony heart put
[55:47] something that's living and breathing
[55:49] and can have space and room for the for
[55:52] the for the Lord to live in yeah and
[55:55] when that's ready when that new heart is
[55:57] there he will come in so then he gives
[56:00] his his spirit so I wanted to that's a
[56:04] little plug that there it's a beautiful
[56:06] message please go and look at it it is
[56:08] online a Stony heart then a new heart
[56:11] but only after that the Lord will bring
[56:14] his spirit and and come living
[56:18] here and I think there was a old
[56:22] commercial back in the day I think it
[56:25] was KitKat that all resistance crumble
[56:28] or was it
[56:31] flake was it flake was it ero okay one
[56:33] of the chocolates you know you look at
[56:35] it then it crumbles you know one of
[56:36] those I think it's a
[56:38] flake and this is where I want to sort
[56:42] of give you hope when you
[56:45] surrender Taz was talking about this as
[56:47] well when you surrender all loneliness
[56:52] crumble right you cannot be alone
[56:54] anymore More You are not alone you
[56:57] cannot be lonely anymore you cannot go
[56:59] into that state where oh everything uh
[57:02] uh you know no one's understanding me or
[57:05] how do I I'm alone in this I don't think
[57:08] everyone is going anyone is going
[57:10] through what I'm going through inside of
[57:11] me it's not true because you are not
[57:15] lonely you are not alone anymore I want
[57:18] to read you this and I don't have
[57:21] it on the on the slides and that's when

[57:30] surrender I was talking about the heart
[57:32] there so let's put up the heart
[57:35] again the
[57:38] heart the heart is the Abode of God and
[57:42] in the Old Testament God dwell in his
[57:45] glory over the ark and the heart is the
[57:48] ark God dwells not in the head he in the
[57:51] heart God is not known by theology God
[57:54] is is not known by mental conception God
[57:56] is known by an oldfashioned Sanctified
[57:59] Born Again experience that's in the
[58:02] human heart yet men and women live a
[58:06] good life and love love God by mental
[58:09] conception we do see it around us but
[58:12] the real hiding place is in the heart
[58:15] hid with Christ see now I'm hid alone
[58:18] with Christ and when Christ the Holy
[58:21] Spirit comes into your heart he is in
[58:25] you with your temper temperament he is
[58:29] uh he is living his own life to his own

[59:09] Hallelujah then the things of the world
[59:11] has passed
[59:12] away how can it be anything but sweet

[1:00:04] Sinner in the voice that he would speak
[1:00:06] to him in he speaks to the prostitute in
[1:00:11] the voice that he would speak to them in
[1:00:13] he thinks through your mind the very
[1:00:16] thoughts that he speaks through your
[1:00:18] heart the very way that he would uh he
[1:00:22] would if he was here on Earth
[1:00:25] and you are no more your own but you
