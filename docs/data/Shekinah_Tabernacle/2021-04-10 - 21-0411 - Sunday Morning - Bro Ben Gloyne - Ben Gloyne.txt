have you down for about six months or so welcome i hope you feel at home so god bless you amen let's just turn to the scripture um actually before we go to we're going to go to acts 26 but before we go let's go to prayer now i was thinking well thought came on my on my heart on i think wednesday or something you know why do we wait to the end of the service to dedicate our lives to lord and you know draw closer to him you know because you know god doesn't move you know he doesn't leave us we leave him you know and he is he has completed his power absolute in his power he's all powerful all you know but it's us to get away from god so why don't we just dedicate our lives to lord and start this meeting the right way it means this bowel heads in our hearts together gracious lord jesus lord it's it's not you that gets away from us lord it's us it gets away from you lord we wander off in our own plans our minds we get led about by spirits and our sins and different things dear god i just want to pray lord may you forgive us of our sins forgive us of our wrongs lord our iniquities cleanse us of our secret faults lord we want to be real close to you today lord jesus we want to be under under the lord under thy great wings oh god lord may we be so close to you on your left hand side maybe feel your heartbeat of your word lord the pulsation of your holy spirit today lord may you grant it lord i pray you cover us in your blood forgive us lord and dear lord just want to commit our lives into your hands lord and just take the service under your control lord i believe there's a new

welcome sister kay here as well god bless you amen trust you feel welcome god bless you one of the old school wellingtonians amen amen uh acts 26 we just go there um and we also have a birthday today you know sometimes people think well we've escaped that but happy birthday sister shannon god bless you 18. amen praise the lord so hang around afterwards we have cake praise the lord amen acts 26 verse 12. this is this is uh this is paul speaking to king agrippa whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecuted thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom that persecuteth but arise and stand upon my feet for i have appeared unto thee by me pardon me for this purpose to make them minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which i will appear unto thee deliver delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision and we're going to go to ecclesiastes as well this may seem like a bit of a shotgun kind of service but we'll get somewhere and we'll start summer end up in another place but i just pray the lord will tie this all together so very familiar piece of scripture if we go to ecclesiastes three and one says here to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill in a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace in a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to reindeer time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war in a time of peace amen we'll just leave it there may the lord bless the reading of his word this morning you may have your seats this morning um i just want to speak about i have a few things in my mind brother he'd ask me what my title is that i got like four rattling around but i want to speak about having an absolute you know the apostle paul could stand there after it was about 30 odd years after that road to damascus experience and and and he was relating that experience to to king agrippa and everyone that was surrounding um you know him and you know to paul that was a that was a defining moment of his life it was more defining than all the all the learning that he received under gamalia all of the bible school that he said and all the all the teaching that no doubt he preached it was it was more defining than that because he met the god that gave the scripture you know it was more than just another it's more than just changing your thinking to another thinking you know brother brown would stand in india and he was challenged by all the major religions of india there was the hindus there was the buddhists there was there was the muslims the jains the sikhs all the different ones there and they they all stood up and they began to tell brother branham how little and weak and useless basically christianity was and and and so he said to them after they did this and i think at jane temple or one of their temples he said well well gentlemen tomorrow we're having a church service and i want to invite you there so they all came now brother brown would preach how jesus christ is the god of gods there's no other god beside him and then and then and then a prayer line would come and the prophet had seen a vision of a son worshiper a blind man that would receive his sight now he'd already seen it in vision now when when the word goes from just ink on paper to to a revelation to you i mean that becomes an absolute it goes from beyond a well i think it's a good idea it's not a good idea this person says this this person thinks this what do i think no it becomes an absolute so in that very moment he knew that jesus christ was alive he knew jesus christ was the very creator of heavens and earth he knew that jesus christ was the only god but in that moment that version brother brahm says he would never have made the challenge he was about to make unless god had already given the vision that that man was going to receive his sight now a man came before him a sun worshiper his eyes were basically white because he stared at the sun thinking that basically if he's looked at the sun long enough he'd receive some kind of blessing or something and he was he was blind and then so he began to challenge all the religions of india and say now we all know this man is blind but let your god if you serve the true and living god let him come now and give him back his sight you know and you know he said but what you would do is you just change the man's thinking from maybe from from from being a buddhist to being a being a muslim from a muslim to be a hindu you know that's all your religions do and and and he said we have the same thing in america all the pentecostals want to make all the baptists pentecostal and all the baptists want to make all the methodist baptists and it's just a changing of thinking but real christianity's not a changing of thinking it's a resurrected power it's the lord jesus christ the word coming into you and him living his life out of you so he made the challenge if you really serve if your god is really god come and give this man his sight back the place was quiet and then he began to pray for the man and begin to thank god he said i felt like elijah on mount carmel but elijah knew where he was standing on mount carmel because he had an absolute come into his life he wasn't just hoping that god would send fire he knew god was gonna send the fire hallelujah so there he was and he prayed for the blind man his eyes were fully restored he could see perfectly well and basically just the whole place just erupted why because there was an absolute that the prophet had it wasn't just a hope so that's why we can actually stand here and say this way is the right way and it is the only way it's not a mixture of ways this is the way jesus says i'm the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father but by me there's only one way hallelujah and it's not just and it's not based on a polished up argument but it's based on a reality where god becomes alive his word becomes living so the apostle paul had it he they came into his life in absolute now we have to have the same kind of an absolute we must have it we if we don't have the absolute of who god is to you the word becoming personal to you alive to you you'll be like sifting sands but if you really know him then upon this rock i'll build my church the lord said and the gates of hell will not prevail i mean today rock there's the revelation of who he is it goes beyond an argument an idea oh well everyone's nice so i'll just join up no it's not about that it's about the lord is alive his word is true he's become real to me it becomes an absolute now the definitive uh definition of absolute it means as webster would say brother brahman preaches this a few places he says it's perfect in itself unlimited in its power primarily an ultimate and an ultimate is the amen that's all it's an absolute it's unlimited in power it's perfect in itself that's all of it it settles it and absolute has the final word you know there's a lot of armchair sports fans and there's replays of referee calls and things and they complain and they say this and this and doesn't matter what sporting arena there's a whole bunch of armchair umpires that think that they have the final say and they think they're right but the man who's dressed or the woman who's the umpire on the field they have the final say they make the call if it was you know lbw or not a nick or not a catch or not whatever kind of sporting thing the ball's in or it's out it's not the people in the stands that make that call there's an absolute on the field that actually says in or out hallelujah and that person no matter the criticism they receive or their all the or their character tries to be shot down you know there's been you know there are there are moments in sport that are talked about more than the actual game this went wrong you know this happened this should happen this way and but at the end of the day who's holding the trophy because an absolute said a certain thing they made a certain ruling they are the amen of the game hallelujah they have the final say now our god when he revealed himself to this ladies in age he said that i am the amen the faithful and true witness hallelujah so what he's declaring to this agent says i am the amen i'm the finality i have the last say in this age there's a lot of people that say a lot of things in this age but i have the final say i am the amen and i've come down in this age to declare that i am the amen and i want you to know i have the final say and i want you to know that i should be your absolute hallelujah amen so a real absolute is unlimited in its power a false absolute is limited in its power a real absolute is perfect in itself i'm just i'm just kind of rephrasing the definitions but a a a false absolute is imperfect in itself so now for an in order to something to be an absolute it must be proved it's an absolute hallelujah just like brother abraham standing in india he proved that his god was the absolute because none of the others stood up the buddhist priest didn't stand up the you know you know the imam from the muslims or the or the priests from the sikhs or whatever they didn't get up and heal the man hallelujah because the absolute stood up and said no no this is and it wasn't the prophet that it was god proving himself he said i want you religious people to know i'm actually the true living god and and brother brown challenged him if god of jesus christ gives this man his sight back you better fall on your face and give your life to him hallelujah if god is god let's serve him if he's not let's find something else to do that's how i feel about it i mean let's be honest if this wasn't real i wouldn't be here i wouldn't be standing here if this wasn't real i mean if this was just a man-made idea i'd be gone but if it is a true and living god if this message is as god revealed today if this bible is our absolute we should give our whole lives to it although we are all of our strength all our ambitions hopes and plans should be actually lord i want your ambitions hopes and plans and because it's when the absolute comes into a person's life then they overcome because they realize that the thing that's fighting for them is greater than the thing fighting against them because the word says greater is he that's in you the he that's in the world that means we've got to come to a conclusion our god is greater our god is stronger our god is able our god is already finished hallelujah amen we don't have something that makes a start and we quit in the middle no someone who has an absolute goes all the way hey amen caleb and joshua they weren't just going with the crowd when they said we're going to take the mountain they received an absolute a lot of other people heard the same preaching but something anchored in their souls it became an absolute to them that it wasn't moses giving a promise it wasn't because everyone else was doing it but it was because god promised them hallelujah so they received an absolute and their absolute was greater than what they saw what they felt you know many people's feelings are they're absolute i don't feel like getting up today they stay in bed i don't feel like going to work today they call the boss i'm not feeling well but it's really just how they feel as opposed to a real sickness yo and their emotions lead them about and they're absolute as their emotions that's not an absolute hallelujah but we have something where we can look to the unseen amen let's go to that scripture i have it in my notes this is one of my favorite favorite scriptures hallelujah the lord is great you think about what we have hallelujah well he's literally going to carry us away amen yeah brother braham says that the holy ghost in you is going to change these atoms that the rapture has already taken place in a people hardly this quickening power you know we've just been through easter hallelujah the quickening power that was released that day hasn't gone away i love that song that we just sung because i believe it he'll pour his spirit out more and more i mean that rapturing faith is being poured out more and more upon the church hallelujah hallelujah i happen to believe it if you don't believe me go back walk camps and conventions used to be like and then go to the most recent ones and go look what's going on it's getting greater it's not getting more diminished god's getting greater because i really think our eyes are coming open that he's here right because god hasn't changed it's just our eyes need to come open when we realize he's unlimited in his power he's more than able to do it i mean his promise is a yay man he's a true and living god and when you realize that he loves you he's not mad at you he loves you that's why he poured his life out on calvary for you he wants to see you around the streets that you're on the streets of gold dancing hallelujah he wants to join that dance hallelujah you know he's not an angry god had you and i because his wrath was poured out that day on calvary the wrath we should have received was poured out hallelujah on the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah now 2nd corinthians 4. we are troubled on every side yet not distressed if you find yourself living this out it's okay we're allowed to be troubled but we have a place of safety in a time of trouble hallelujah we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken my god doesn't leave me alone hallelujah some people like some children i wish you just leave me alone my god doesn't leave me alone i'm happy about that i don't want him to leave me alone because i'm not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life force of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same spirit of faith as according it is written i believed therefore have i spoken ye also believe and therefore speak amen we've got to confess some things you can't just keep it bottled up they're going to be a pressure burst somewhere hallelujah knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not that though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment every trial is in this category because if you have an absolute remember that absolute isn't just for our earthly journey the absolute our lord jesus christ our absolutist to take us into glory so i really are because i think some people think we're very narrow-minded you need to be more open-minded you know the world's moved on think a bit more progressively well actually we are we are the most open-minded people in the world because our mind goes beyond the five senses and goes from eternity to eternity we actually see the big picture that's open-minded if you see a small part that's actually closed-minded if you only see what people's opinions and and your feelings and fire you know the five senses that's very narrow-minded thinking but open-minded thinking is actually lord you've called me for a purpose you put me upon the earth for a reason i'm not here just taking up space holy but i'm here to to to manifest your glory that you'll come live in me and hallelujah manifest your glory out of me i'm here to be a living witness doesn't matter what part of the body i'm part of i'm part of the body i may be a toe hallelujah i'm a toe i may be a rib praise the lord i may be the little bone in the inside of the air i have a function we're all important amen for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal now you take the apostle paul's life he went through some things he didn't just have some bad days he had some real bad days most of the most of the uh new testament that he wrote he did not sit in a nice place in the country with his feet up and a lazy boy riding letters he was chained to a guard he was in prison he was hungry he was cold he had trouble he had pressure but yet in all of that the lord inspired him to write such things hallelujah hallelujah he knew what it was like to be persecuted his kind of itinerary of preaching was based i'm gonna go preach in this city peop unbelievers gonna rise up they're gonna persecute me they're gonna go to another city they're gonna follow me to this next city i'm gonna have a service there we're gonna have a wonderful time then the people from that previous city gonna come and you know beat me and you there's gonna be trouble i'm gonna raise up that was and i'd end up in jail that was how that's how his itinerary went we're gonna sleep tomorrow paul uh in jail what about a hotel motel now i don't need that i got free accommodation i got a free chauffeur to get me there hallelujah but you know but he wasn't looking he had a heart he had a hard road hallelujah shipwrecked persecuted false brethren coming unawares antichrist spirits he fought against you know sickness beatings peril all kind of trouble but because he had an absolute he didn't quit hallelujah he didn't quit when he stood there before king agrippa that we read and you take that 30 odd years of of of time from acts 9 to was it acts 26 a lot of things happen in that span of time there's a lot of peril there's a lot of hardship there's a lot of trouble there's a lot of glorious times too but you know we should never let the bad outweigh the good hallelujah we should never draw back just because of bad we should put push forward because he had an absolute those things didn't move him he said none of these things moved me hallelujah he had a lot come against him he had opposition we've got to realize we have opposition it's good we have opposition because we have opposition that means there's an opposing force against us who is that that's the devil he said the devil's on my case that's not a bad thing that means that you're fighting him hallelujah hallelujah you know we all have mind battles we're not a men from mind battles we're not immune from trouble but we have an overcoming power hallelujah amen why because we receive an absolute now brother braham says this here he says he says in the message absolute he says but the word absolute is an ultimate and therefore i think that everybody should have an ultimate and every great achievement that's ever been achieved there has been an absolute behind it no matter what it was it had an absolute behind it and every person in order to achieve something has first to have the absolute and that's the final win back through this that back through the other till you come to that absolute all the amen or the ultimate and what you've got something you have to tie to in other words it's the final tying post to every achievement it's somewhere it might wind through many difficult things till you get to that thai post but there is an amen to all of it there must be such a thing you cannot go through life without having one so he says it winds through a lot of difficult places the apostle paul i'm sure we would agree that he had to wind through being a pharisee of the pharisees that was a massive one he had to go past who he thought he was to what who god made him to be the rich and ruler couldn't wind past that but paul could and because he wound past those things he got an absolute thai post in his life where it went more from the high priest backing and a and a letter in his hand from the high priest to the living god coming and living in his life hallelujah there was a living a living word amen amen this is what we must have if we ever want to achieve anything we must have an absolute now we must be very careful what our absolute is if our abs if you're absolute as me you have the wrong absolute there should have been a universal amen right there if you're absolute as this church you have the wrong absolute but if your absolute is the word then you have the right absolute right because this church can change we're human i pray we we just keep we just become more like the lord i pray we change in that way i pray we never just sit down and fall asleep i pray we press the battle that's what i pray become more like the lord more like his word i mean so you cannot make a church you're absolute you cannot make me your absolute brother brahms absolute was the bible right that should be our absolute what about the message well well it reveals christ in the scripture amen but we shouldn't you know don't make me your absolute we're not here to mimic one another we're here to become like the lord like his word amen amen jesus is coming for people who reflect him who manifest that's what he's looking for the female part of himself he's not looking for me and you and that'll be the worst thing to ever happen amen right i don't know why everyone don't be like me don't have my mannerisms please don't have my temperament you know don't talk like me don't act don't don't try and mimic me whatever you do be like the lord brother braham said that there'd be plenty of mimics in this day let's not be mimics let's be the genuine amen so paul had an absolute but the thing is now your absolute as i said must be the right thing now if i have this here someone who leads us in a different direction can other than to christ becomes our absolute brotherhood says this in an absolute and and i heard this a few years ago but but it really struck me if you can read that scripture something that christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because of some twisting around if someone would tell you that that was for the disciples or for something else and then you don't hold on and and then you don't hold on to that which is the word then christ is not your absolute that person who led you out of the way is your absolute we don't want someone else to become our absolute because the person because that person you know what do you call it uh influences your life in such a way you begin to go another way go with the scripture though christian but he becomes your or she becomes your absolute i just want you to think about these things a little bit you know but our absolute should be the word of god hallelujah amen now moses got an absolute in his life he was told that he'd be the deliverer now i now i just want to i just want to contrast now the difference between uh you being your own absolute and god becoming your absolute and it's all based on revelation because if it's if it's man doing it if it's you trying to do it it it's different to god revealing it there's there's actually a big difference between knowing something in your mind and it being in your heart because if it's in your heart you know god will do it and you're rejoicing because you know he'll do it it doesn't mean you quit and say you know because some people say well god will just have to do it they just forget about it no if you know god will do it then you'll praise him for it hallelujah with thanksgiving that it's there it's yours but if it's in your mind then you'll try and manufacture it now moses was the promised son he was a serpent bruiser in his day he was a prophesied one who will deliver the children of israel out of egypt that was that was his piece of scripture that he was um ordained to manifest that was that was him in prophecy right but now there had had to come a time where where that child would be born now when you realize it's god and only god that can do it that's when we really go to prayer right that's when people really go to prayer because there's a big difference between oh yes i know god will do it but you're trying to do it and actually you're realizing only god can do it because it actually manifests in two different ways because if it's you trying to do it then you humanly try and control the situation make it happen right but if you know only god can do it that should push us into prayer hallelujah so so moses's father and the message um lifting him up out of history amran was a slave and slave in in egypt as but as an israelite just like all the others and he was beaten like everyone else he was he was fed probably the bad food or mistreated like everyone else but he had something burning in his heart that now was the season remember there's a season for all things that's why i read there in ecclesiastes there's a season for all things we happen to be living in a resurrection season we have to be living in a real good season but if there's a season for it then there must be a people on the earth that manifest that season amen just like brother brown would preach about your ducks would swarm at a certain season you know we have little birds i think they're called godwits that that actually travel from new zealand up to alaska and back but as the season changes then they migrate and then they come back who knows about them one of the most furthest migrating birds in the world apparently and so but it's when the season changes something stirs up within them they have to fly they can't stay here in the beautiful new zealand they've got to go up to alaska or wherever they go they go a real long way but it's because there's a change of season now when the season changes it's because the atmosphere begins to change right when spring spring happens because the atmosphere changes the earth goes out by the earth goes a little bit closer to the sun and the soil temperature rises you know there's more sunlight it becomes warmer hardly there's your spring rain different things and life begins to come forth why because the season is changing now we're living in a season of resurrection hallelujah we're living in a season of all things amen not just not just a partial you know not just a partial word but a full word so we're living in the time of the manifestation of the sons of god now i might be throwing out a lot of terms but i want you to think about it where god ordained his church to be joining us with christ right but it's now it's not just talking about it and actually becomes a living reality because it's the season for it and there's a season for satan to be under the feet of the bride of christ because it's a season for it it's the season for all devils to be cast out as the season that now it's not the devil fighting us anymore but we're fighting him it's the season that we are not on the retreat but we're on the attack it is a season for god to pour out his spirit more and more it's a season for the revelation of the open book to become living i mean when john saw the lamb take the book and all of heaven and earth and under heard him cry out blessings and honor and glory to the lamb why because it became a reality to him even just in that prophetic way but it was the season for the bride to respond you know it's you know there should be such a worship in our hearts jesus paid it all and all to him io what is the you know to me what does this seals opening really do it magnifies what god has done brother brown says in one place that john's lifted up there in revelations 4 and 5 because god wants to show what you know yo to the redeemed what he has done amen amen hallelujah so it should it should produce such a thanksgiving because it's a season for it it's a season four revival it's a season for an awakening what it's the season for it now amram was stepping into a season that season was the deliverer had to be born to take israel out of egypt and and take them into the promised land and because there was now an atmosphere changing if i can put it that way because there is a hunger rising up in the people lord you promised you'd take us out of this place and you know why the world gets uncomfortable because god wants to make it that we want to leave hallelujah that's why this world gets uncomfortable for a believer it's not be you know we have the most you know if you think about naturally we're the most comfortable houses beds cars how hot do you want it how how how much you want to blow do you want this room to be this temperature do you want your seat warmer on your car hot medium you know how about your electric blanket you know do you want how thick do you want your puffer jacket to be yeah you can i mean there's you could man you could be comfortable eh but naturally that is the way you know we complain if our coffee's been you know roasted too long you know there's all this trouble it's been extracted about five seconds too long yeah this is you know because we get comfortable a certain way so naturally this world is very comfortable but spiritually to the believer it's very uncomfortable because the devil's released on the earth you know all those demons been released out of hell all those different things but it's meant to be that way because god doesn't want us to stay here he wants us to leave but there's got to be a cry in us lord the word has come open it's been for 50 60 years since the prophet was here we know you're still upon the earth lord your spirit's still here you're gathering your people but lord when will the last one come in that we can go home lord when will it be that we see the dead in christ rise and you change our bodies lord there's got to be a time lord might be now may not be later i don't want it to be ten years five years two years away but lord might be now i want to leave i want to be with you that should be the cry of our hearts hallelujah ultimately is lord i want to be where you are i don't just want to feel your presence so that is the greatest thing in all the world hallelujah i want to see you face to face i want to see the one who died for me redeem me hallelujah rose again justified me freely forever amen so so now there's a season changing hallelujah when the world is looking at a lot of other things the bride's looking at something else which is his promised word hallelujah so now amram began to pray because there's a season change and he prayed and he prayed and he was the kind of man that didn't take no for an answer although if god was silent he kept seeking him hallelujah he'd be beaten in the fields tired he went up and prayed he sought god because he knew the absolute of the word was a deliverer is going to be born and he's got to be born hallelujah well what if someone else let someone else pray for it but you know you know jehovah bed would say to him which was his wife can you let the boys you work with can you let them go pray he said but what if they don't do it because down in his jewish heart they bur burn to faith that no winds of doubt could ever blow out why because he had an absolute hallelujah he says so this isn't lifting him up out of history but today the people if they don't get everything they ask for the first time they pray they seem to think that he's dead what we need is men and women today of gallant spirit men and women who are determined to hold on till they see a god that really lives come into action they will not take no for an answer they're determined to stay with it if they are sick and the doctor says they can't get well yet something within them tells them they're going to get well hold on no matter what takes place have you joined the churches of the denominational world after you have swapped sapped all your strength from walking from place to place and you still can't find relief there is still a god that answers prayer and saves from sin and as we can see amram on those weary nights back bleeding climbing up the steps again until two and three o'clock in the morning praying and seemed like he was just talking to the wind down in his heart they're burned of faith that no winds of doubt could ever blow out there's a kind of men and women we need to rise on the scene today if he doesn't answer tonight he will answer tomorrow night if he doesn't answer this year he'll he will next year for he's a god not a god but the god and we see him night after night as amram climbed the steps and johaka bed would come up to him and say amram dear you've been up here all night praying why don't why don't you just tell some of the boys where you're working and let them pray a while he says well honey what if they don't do it somebody has got to do it somebody's has got to pray through and that's the way every christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else but take the front ourselves and go through if we believe the bible to be a history it's also a prophetic book that tells that the same god shall raise in the last days and it's time for him to come on the scene so amram had a absolute that god had to do it and that's why it drove him to prayer it wasn't him trying to manufacture this deliverer coming so it wasn't in here it wasn't his human ability how can i make the promise come to pass he knew it was god because he knew the promise this deliverer is going to come it was revealed to him so he's he's praying lord when is he going to come then you're following me and so what he did is he prayed because he knew it was it could only be god that could bring him forth but then moses is born and moses has been told by his mum that he is that promised child so he knows that he is this promised child but the problem is he doesn't have an absolute yet his absolute is just what his mom told them which was fair and true but it hadn't become a reality so what he begins to do is he says now how can i humanly deliver these people i have all this military training i'm a great leader i was a prince in the house you know pharaoh's house so how can i humanly do it because it was in here he knew he was he could do the job he was born to do the job it hadn't come down into here so now he's like now how physically can i make this happen and he sees his opportunity he kills an egyptian think this is going to spark a revolution but all it did was actually make him become a runaway prophet because his human ability was not what god wanted to use it was god's ability in his life he wanted the absolute of himself to come into moses and then show it happen amen see we have to come to our end when we come to our end of our own ability that's when god steps in that's what we have to come to amen we must realize that we our own ability is not what god wants to use you know in our own human ability to do it it's god's ability that he wants and so if we come to a spot where people just think well if god's going to do it he's going to do it and we quit then that's not the right kind of epi um attitude now i'm trying to read my notes here and and probably at the time i wrote them they made sense but my english is not really i wish it was my second language because that means i could defend myself somehow i got through school anyway but see it's like when we raise children okay now it makes sense to me you should see my handwriting oh boy sometimes i've got to turn it like this and make out what it says anyway you know it's like when we raise our children we realize god has to save them i'm glad i got some amens you know we realize they has to meet god like we've met god but if it becomes our own human ability trying to trying to control them in a certain way for them to become christians that's only in here right but when it anchors down into here lord your blood was for them just like for me repent be baptized everyone in the name of jesus christ for a mission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost promises to you and to your children right when that anchors down into here then what should that really do throw us into prayer and also a total surrender hallelujah that's what it really should do amen should throw us into a total surrender because we know a partially surrendered christian god can't use that may be a strong statement but you know brother brahm says in the message of total deliverance i like these kind of little i just like it he says now he says if you're a christian god don't make any halfway christians god makes complete christians god doesn't make halfway preachers but a preacher can be halfway and god makes his children christians but sometimes they're halfway christians now our god is not a halfway god what do you mean by halfway well he's about to explain it but if it's but it's not god's intentions for them to be that way it's their own ways got mixed up with the plans of god for their life and that what that's what makes them the way they are which is halfway so it's when we get our own plans mixed up with the plan of god that's how someone becomes a halfway christian but we're not made to be halfway right how's everyone right now everybody okay we're not called to be halfway christians but it's when we put our idea into it then that's how when we mix our own ways with the plan of god then that's what makes them them the way they are god doesn't want them to be halfway christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side he wants them to completely stand in the breach he says now moses god had made him a complete prophet for a complete deliverance and moses was completely surrendered to the hands of god that's the reason it made him what he was he was so complete and god till god could trust him so that's how so we know the plan of god is for our for our family to be saved right but it's when we mix our own ability and with it that's why i say it's so important if it anchors into our heart that the lord's salvation is for them then it should drive us to a total surrender and and it should drive us to prayer because if we're totally surrendered then god can totally use us amen and that's what we want amen amen and it should drive us to prayer just like amram said lord when is it going to happen lord you promise your promises deliver when is he going to come and he kept praying until he got an answer because he was revealed to him he was going to come hallelujah amen but we are here for a total deliverance amen this is the season for it this is not a season for a partial deliverance this is a season for a total deliverance amen where moses be when when he was totally in the hands of god that same man that just killed one egyptian became a runaway amen he became he became a mighty tool in god's hand hallelujah when he met god in the burning bush he received an absolute that absolute went from here i know i'm the deliverer to i'm sending you moses i'm sending you moses i've heard the cry of my people and i've come down and i'm sending you to do the job and then moses i can't speak i can't do this i can't do that and all the excuses is you he could throw in front of god and god just batted them all and said who made the mouth to speak amen god wasn't god wasn't feeling sorry for moses of all of his excuses god got angry at moses hallelujah that's why we could never yo the devil tries to give us all these excuses why we can't serve god but god just says no hold on amen hold on i'm here to make you a christian i'm here to be the christian in your life it's not you being the christian it's him as the christian in you that's the only way we can be christians hallelujah and that's why we need a total deliverance i mean because we're totally delivered from our thinking we really got to sometimes look like hit the rewind button on your on your thought process and press play and and listen to it you need to think about how you think because if you will walk along like a defeated always thinking defeated and always looking at the past and what went wrong and this happened here and i stuffed up here and i'll never achieve nothing here and this went wrong here and you know you you're gonna bring your past with you into the present and you become what you think right right so if you think defeated well you'll be defeated amen but if you think no i'm more than able because i'm more than a conqueror through him that loved me hallelujah i am his workmanship it's not me working on myself the scaffolding that's been put up is not my i'm not my own building project i'm god's building project i'm more than able to do it hallelujah because god is going to cause me to do it if we if we think defeated like if we if we're living in fear all the time that fear will come upon us sometimes people are scared to be about being scared we should not we shouldn't be scared about nothing because our god is able he totally delivered moses moses totally delivered the people hallelujah they left egypt they really did when when when moses received that absolute hallelujah he he went down into pharaoh's uh throne room he said let my people go and that absolute said you're gonna let he's gonna eventually let them go hallelujah because he had an absolute his absolute didn't change hallelujah because absolute couldn't change if you're absolute as someone else then they can change right if your absolute is the opinion of the world or even the church that absolutely will change but if you're absolute is the word of god then it won't change and you'll keep pushing on amen amen now moses took the people out because of an absolute our absolute must be i'm just gonna i'm just gonna wind this up but our absolute must be the lord jesus christ his word it must be it cannot be opinion it cannot be our own idea or our own thought it must be what god has declared paul was only as strong before he met the lord on the road to damascus as his organization he says here brother brahm says now since meeting him face to face i'll say this he says in any christ-centered life that's your absolute now since meeting him face to face on the road to damascus that meant so much to paul now remember he was a scholar beforehand he was a mighty man in the scriptures but he didn't have any thai post but the sanhedrin that that would back him up and a diploma and a great teacher he was a great man in his field but he was waiting only thing he had his absolute would only be as strong as his organization was that's all the stronger he could be but then he met the lord on the road to damascus and his absolute actually became an absolute unlimited in its power hallelujah so here we are and and i'm actually i just feel to close what is your absolute jesus christ if it's your opinion i would i would get rid of it if it's the word of god i would hold on to it remember this message is not a bunch of doctrine only it's not to form a different move it's jesus christ revealed hallelujah and when he becomes real to you it goes beyond tapes it goes beyond even a church or even even even income paper when he steps out and meets you that's what he wants to do then he becomes your absolute and that absolute will give you a stabilization in your life doesn't matter all storms may come and go but the peace of god you will know hallelujah even your own thinking may war against you hallelujah but if there's that absolute that absolute always come and fight for you when you need him amen so what's your absolute my absolute the love of god filled my heart by by a kitchen sink and i realized how much i love him because of how much he loved me and died for me on the cross and the bible became a new book and the message became alive it this became a personal letter to me and the word is unfolders i've walked with the lord but he's still the same absolute amen amen that's why we're going to take everything we do and what we believe take it back into the word from genesis to revelation from 47 to 65 you know take the whole thing in continuity right but so so my absolute is not an argument my absolute is the lord jesus christ who stepped out of history to me so i leave you with that who's your absolute or what's if you're your own absolute you get a better one if i'm your absolute get a better one if the word is your absolute that's the only one he's unlimited in his power amen so let's tell the musicians please this morning amen hallelujah let's stand shall we you know if you know the lord if he is your absolute you know that the blood absolutely cleanses you from wilson you know that his sacrifice is an absolute it's the amen it's the final say when the devil says no but they did this and this and this no you just point to your absolute because his he has the final say i mean so let's um let's sing um a wash in the blood of the lamb hallelujah amen have you been to jesus for the cleansing power have you been have you met this absolute i really pray you have amen isn't g
