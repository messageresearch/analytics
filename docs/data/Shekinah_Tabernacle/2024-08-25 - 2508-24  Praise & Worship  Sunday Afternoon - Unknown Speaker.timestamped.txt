[5:14] to the um praise and
[5:18] worship 2024
[5:21] session um I think in our fellowship we
[5:25] have we are probably skewed more in
[5:30] in favor of musicians they non-m
[5:33] musicians that would almost be correct
[5:34] wouldn't
[5:35] it put your hands up if you if you are a
[5:38] musician or if
[5:40] you can kind of sing okay like you think
[5:42] you know I'm a bit of a put your hands
[5:44] up now come on be honest and you do
[5:46] items if you do a special ever then you
[5:47] got to put your hand up tth you're doing
[5:49] specials come on
[5:53] see yeah plus us yeah we're yeah we're
[5:57] 51% but um
[6:00] you realize that growing up in a church
[6:02] actually you become a lot more musical
[6:04] than if you don't um grow up in a church
[6:06] because you each each week sometimes
[6:09] twice a week you are singing and being
[6:11] involved in music so as a general rule
[6:13] Christians are actually more musically
[6:16] minded than
[6:17] non-christians um so I think it's a um
[6:21] it's an enjoyable thing to um be able to
[6:25] sing together and worship God and to
[6:28] yeah music is quite powerful in a sense
[6:30] that everyone can enter into the same
[6:33] atmosphere of a song you know we can all
[6:34] do it together and enter in and sing so
[6:37] thanks um brother Jimmy for arranging
[6:39] this session um we've got a a a bunch of

[17:33] because we don't see it immediately but
[17:35] the song is saying um just look at the
[17:38] details and that's where you'll see God
[17:40] and sometimes those details at the
[17:42] moment you don't see those details cuz
[17:44] all the details you see you don't but

[22:13] desert me just
[22:16] [Music]
[22:18] now God bless
[22:20] you and the song the song that I'm going
[22:24] to
[22:25] sing talks about the city of
[22:29] the home that we are going to and it's
[22:32] actually in the suet by and
[22:34] by there's a there's a land that is
[22:37] fairer you know that song but it's in
[22:40] suot to so it's not a direct translation
[22:44] word for word but it's the same context
[22:47] or same meaning if you know the song it
[22:50] blesses me so much because it doesn't
[22:53] talk about the past doesn't talk about
[22:56] the current challenges it talks about
[22:59] the our future and that's that's why we
[23:01] are all looking forward or
[23:04] ahead to experience
[23:07] amen is that the
[23:11] one which one I'm

[1:34:14] instruments but you know one brother
[1:34:16] said he said the best instrument of all
[1:34:17] as a human voice and how we can uh uh
[1:34:20] you know it's it's more than just like
[1:34:22] this is a piece of wood with some
[1:34:23] strings and that it's made in a certain
[1:34:25] way and when you when you pluck it it
[1:34:26] makes a sound but you know that that
[1:34:28] guitar say we take a guitar for instance
[1:34:30] that guitar in itself it it it's only
[1:34:33] expressing what something else is
[1:34:34] playing through it you know it's it's
[1:34:37] although it's making a beautiful sound
[1:34:38] it doesn't it can't do that in and of
[1:34:40] itself but you know we have this voice
[1:34:43] here that we can feel something in our
[1:34:45] heart and then we can sing it out
[1:34:46] through here and it it it comes out but
[1:34:48] it's from somewhere in our heart like we
[1:34:51] can do our voices can do what none of
[1:34:52] these instruments can do they can
[1:34:54] express and we can we can praise the
[1:34:56] Lord so let's just sing Hallelujah which
