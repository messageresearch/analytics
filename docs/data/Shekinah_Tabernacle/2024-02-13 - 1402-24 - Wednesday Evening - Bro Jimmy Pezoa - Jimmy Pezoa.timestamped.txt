[22:33] [Music]
[22:41] good
[22:42] blent welcome to the house of the
[22:45] Lord man every time that I'm standing
[22:47] here I'm just so nervous
[22:51] okay yeah that's
[22:54] okay let's um open our Bibles in the the
[22:58] book of Hebrews chapter
[23:01] 11 the Hall of Fame of the
[23:06] faith can read on verse
[23:11] 8 and the Bible says oh thank you
[23:17] guys by faith Abraham when he was called
[23:21] to go out into a place which he should
[23:24] after receive for inheritance obeyed and
[23:27] he went out not knowing whether he went
[23:31] by faith he soj joed in the land of
[23:34] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[23:36] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the
[23:40] is with him of the same promise for he
[23:43] looked for a city which had foundations
[23:46] who Builder and maker is
[23:49] God Amen what a faith let's pray thank
[23:53] you Lord God Almighty I want to ask you
[23:56] to please talk through me
[23:58] to bless your bride Lord please use me
[24:03] Lord if we want to ask you this in Jesus
[24:04] Christ's name amen am you can have your
[24:09] SE
[24:10] so I don't know why I don't know how but
[24:13] I got this thought about to
[24:15] talk the New
[24:17] Jerusalem because we know that we
[24:20] are looking for a city that's right but
[24:23] I wanted to talk today about this city
[24:25] yeah and there's some things that
[24:27] brother brand talks about this city that
[24:30] is going to be have like a pyramid shape
[24:34] and it's going to be huge it's going to
[24:36] be awesome so we can keep reading here
[24:39] in the Hallelujah book of uh Hebrews and
[24:43] says for they that say such things de
[24:46] clear plainly that they seek a country
[24:49] yeah not truly if they have been mindful
[24:51] of that country from whence they came
[24:53] out they might have had opportunity to
[24:56] have returned but but now they desire a
[24:59] bitter country that is and Heavenly
[25:01] wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[25:03] called their God for he had prepared for
[25:06] them a city amen Lord thank you Jesus I
[25:10] wanted to talk a little bit about
[25:12] Abraham and how he truly trust in the
[25:16] Lord to just take his family and just
[25:20] move to a random place that he didn't
[25:23] even know anything about it Cu uh
[25:28] how many of you guys are kiwis like
[25:31] fully kiwis can you
[25:35] LIF
[25:40] okay most of us I would say we came from
[25:44] another land but we heard about New
[25:47] Zealand we saw pictures probably we saw
[25:51] videos we knew that a country called New
[25:53] Zealand exist but Abraham he didn't know
[25:57] anything he just went for it for it
[25:59] because the Lord said to him now you go
[26:03] and find the
[26:04] city but Abraham also had his body
[26:08] changed and he got this the promised son
[26:12] so he knew that the one that gave him
[26:14] the promise was truly Unfaithful so
[26:17] that's why he was he just took that
[26:20] promise and yes he just went for
[26:23] it amen and we know that we are pilgrims
[26:27] and we have that song that we sing this
[26:30] world is not my home I'm just passing
[26:32] through my treasures are laid up
[26:34] somewhere beyond the blue the Angels
[26:37] Beck on me from Heaven's open door and I
[26:39] can't feel at home in this world anymore
[26:42] that's right that's how um how do you
[26:45] say the
[26:47] thing that's how
[26:50] amen
[26:54] um also um wanted to say something about
[26:57] human migration and here's where
[27:00] um most of us we take some part in this
[27:04] and it says since earliest time humanity
[27:07] has been on the move some people move in
[27:10] search of work or Economic Opportunity
[27:13] to join family or to study all the move
[27:15] to escape conflict persecution or large
[27:18] scale human rights
[27:20] violations we move here to New Zealand
[27:23] because we saw like a better opportunity
[27:25] here that's why we just left our country
[27:29] talking my personal
[27:30] case but you know like that's why we are
[27:35] waiting for that City because we know
[27:37] there is a better place to go Hallelujah
[27:39] there's nothing like
[27:41] that we fully trust in the Lord that he
[27:44] is going
[27:45] to that he's preparing for us that City
[27:48] that's going to be so much better than
[27:50] this world
[27:54] Hallelujah but if we talk about
[27:56] migration we can find this a kind of
[28:01] fantastic and weird kind of
[28:06] migration what we what you looking there
[28:08] is a init people that they move from
[28:12] that where the theory said that um there
[28:14] was a bridge from Siberia to Alaska and
[28:17] they cross over the Arctic but they just
[28:20] stopped there some people say that they
[28:23] sto because there were some tribes that
[28:25] they were like Warriors they you know
[28:27] they were fighting so they didn't let
[28:29] them keep coming through so they just
[28:33] stopped there can you even imagine to
[28:37] live there you can go to the snow for a
[28:39] couple of hours for one day or two and
[28:42] then you go back home but they live
[28:44] there probably that Uncle Bob catching
[28:48] some something for
[28:50] breakfast that's tough condition yeah
[28:53] really tough condition and like in a a
[28:56] spiritual journey
[28:58] like sometimes we can be in a place like
[29:01] that can you imagine we're just so hard
[29:04] and some people they can just stop in a
[29:08] very desertic
[29:10] place don't stop there just keep
[29:13] migrating to a better
[29:16] place also wanted to put a picture of
[29:18] some people that they're living in
[29:20] desert man I can't imagine how it can be
[29:23] that they heat no water what kind of
[29:27] vges can you grow there probably nothing
[29:30] what a tough condition of Life to
[29:33] Live very
[29:35] hard and out of all those places like
[29:38] very desertic places we can also find
[29:42] something different that's does anyone
[29:44] know the name of that
[29:47] River the Snake River Snake River no
[29:51] it's the Amazon you right the Amazon
[29:54] River you can see all the vegetation
[29:57] so green but there's a saying and it's
[30:02] like every creature in the Amazon evolve
[30:05] to kill
[30:06] humans you can find spiders very long
[30:10] anacondas you can find a very kind of
[30:13] weird alligator there even like
[30:15] microscopic fish that they can really
[30:19] give you really bad
[30:21] pain B
[30:26] J
[30:27] and I think you know like in the Amazon
[30:31] river that everything evolve to destroy
[30:34] kind of kill humans that's how the world
[30:36] is now yeah everything it was just so
[30:40] corrupted yeah and like doesn't matter
[30:43] where you go even if you're in your
[30:46] house you have a phone and that's just
[30:49] rubish rubbish everywhere you can't stop
[30:52] it you go out to a shop the music that
[30:55] they're playing the clothes that they're
[30:57] wearing it's like everything was just
[31:00] corrupted to kind of send humans to
[31:06] hell
[31:10] but here do you know what's that pictor
[31:12] Shannon you you
[31:18] American well that's the fall of Saigon
[31:21] in Vietnam that's when the when the
[31:23] Gringos they had to run away cuz the
[31:25] Viet Kong was going to to hit them and
[31:28] hit them really hard so they just had to
[31:31] evacuate but they call it
[31:35] extraction so what's an extraction this
[31:37] extraction says in military tactics says
[31:40] um is a process of removing Personnel
[31:43] when it considered imperative that they
[31:46] be immediately immediately relocated of
[31:49] a hostile environment and taken to an
[31:51] area either occupied or controlled by
[31:54] friendly personal we are waiting for our
[31:56] extraction
[31:58] we are waiting for that Raptor that's
[31:59] going to take us out of here of this
[32:02] corrupted
[32:03] world
[32:05] Amen but let's talk a little bit more of
[32:08] the city that was the initial thought oh
[32:10] man you're not going to read that can
[32:11] you read
[32:13] that and here is John this is John
[32:16] talking Revelation 21 and I saw no
[32:19] Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty
[32:22] and the lamb are the Temple of it and
[32:25] the city had no need of of the sun
[32:27] neither of the moon to shine in for the
[32:30] glory of the Lord that lighted it and
[32:32] the lamb is a light thereof and the
[32:35] nations of them which are saved shall
[32:38] walk in the light of it you Lord and the
[32:40] king of the earth to bring their Glory
[32:43] and Honor into it and the gates of it
[32:46] shall be no shot at all by day for there
[32:50] shall be no night there amen and they
[32:53] shall bring the glory and honor of the
[32:56] nation in into it and there shall be and
[32:59] there shall in no wise enter into any
[33:03] that defileth neither whatsoever work
[33:06] Abominations or
[33:08] Marth a lie but they which are written
[33:13] in the Lamb's Book of Life thank you
[33:16] Lord we I sometimes I I use it word
[33:20] lucky but there's no luck we're just so
[33:23] blessed that our names are written there
[33:26] in the book of life that we have
[33:28] something so much better waiting for
[33:31] us only if we truly trust in the promise
[33:35] of the
[33:36] Lord and um we can read here in First
[33:42] Corinthian chapter six who are the kind
[33:45] of person that they are not going to
[33:47] enter and he is know you know that the
[33:51] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[33:53] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[33:56] fornicated
[33:57] nor idolators nor adulterers nor
[34:00] effeminate nor abusers of thems with
[34:04] mankind no thieves no kishes no drunkers
[34:08] no revilers is that how you say that way
[34:11] nor extortionist shall inherit the
[34:13] kingdom of God and such were some of
[34:17] you

[39:20] couldn't speak any English if you think
[39:22] my English is bad now imagine there when
[39:24] I just
[39:25] came and I saw the customers I start
[39:28] checking my backpack my
[39:31] suitcase and they just
[39:33] left and then at the distance I saw this
[39:36] um kind of place or something with a
[39:42] dog I was man I'm done cuz I I took here
[39:46] to New Zealand a backpack that I used to
[39:48] put some weed in it so the dog came
[39:50] smell
[39:52] everything so this dog came was like a
[39:55] little bigle or something
[39:57] and he made my backpack and he sat down
[39:59] I said man I'm
[40:02] done I'm done customers I took the
[40:04] backpack they start cheing everything
[40:06] and I I accept the
[40:09] Lord while I was on the plane and I
[40:13] received the Holy Ghost there too CU my
[40:15] life changed yes so I couldn't lie man
[40:20] it was so hard oh my but when the C when
[40:24] the police said to me do you have any
[40:26] drugs in the backpack I have no idea how
[40:28] I say it but I said to them I used to
[40:32] have drugs in the backpack but there's
[40:33] no drugs
[40:35] now and they walk into the
[40:37] office they came out they walk into they
[40:40] make me wait like two hours they was
[40:44] deciding what they were going to do with
[40:46] me cuz I didn't have any drugs but I was
[40:48] like a dodgy Latino
[40:52] guy so after all that talking they said
[40:54] to me cuz Chile had like an agreement
[40:57] with the New Zealand that we were going
[40:59] to we were we were able to come here for
[41:02] 3 month for holidays and then go back
[41:06] they said to me we are only going to
[41:07] give you seven days and then you have to
[41:10] leave the country you take it otherwise
[41:13] we we put you in the next plane and you
[41:15] go back to
[41:17] Chile man I was sad I really wanted to
[41:21] come
[41:23] here
[41:24] but I went to cry Church where Pedro
[41:28] used um where Pedro
[41:30] lives and we do all the papers and
[41:34] applications and I got three month to
[41:37] receive a Visa tourist
[41:39] visa and then we extended to six months
[41:42] and then I got a work visa and then
[41:45] another work
[41:46] visa and then they said to me I I
[41:49] receive an email
[41:51] saying okay now you have been here for a
[41:54] while now you have to leave the country
[41:55] for one
[41:57] year and then you can come back and I
[42:00] was already talking to Stephanie we were

[42:05] were going to send me
[42:06] back but I did a promise with the Lord I
[42:09] said to him Lord just send me back to
[42:12] Chile when I'm ready to go back cuz it's
[42:15] very hard when you have all your
[42:17] friends in the same place that you used
[42:19] to live with when you were not a
