[22:55] kumin I don't know what's happening to
[22:57] me
[23:00] I'm being serious I don't know what's
[23:02] happening but the Lord's doing something
[23:04] and and
[23:08] and
[23:12] he he's either going to let this thing
[23:14] that's been this enemy that's been at me
[23:16] for about 15 years totally defeat me or
[23:18] he's going to totally defeat it because
[23:21] there's something going on man it's
[23:24] unreal but you know yeah and sometimes
[23:28] overwhelming you know Shannon was just I
[23:31] didn't get a chance to listen to the
[23:32] message that brother Ben put on this
[23:34] week yet but Shannon listened to it and
[23:35] she said oh this is you should listen to
[23:36] this this is exactly for you and she was
[23:39] just as I was getting this ready this
[23:40] afternoon she was she just kind of
[23:43] preached to
[23:46] me recap the sermon and I I don't know
[23:48] man there was something about it just
[23:49] tears were streaming down my face as she
[23:50] was just saying these things and you
[23:53] know God's God's always doing something
[23:55] in your life even if it seems like he's
[23:57] it's quiet he's always doing something
[23:58] he's always planning something he's
[24:00] never just he never just forgets about
[24:01] you and thinks oh whoops that's right
[24:03] brother imp's there oh I forgot about
[24:05] him and he was going through that and oh
[24:06] man and I should have started this
[24:08] process years earlier because now I'm
[24:10] behind in it and I I was supposed to
[24:11] have something in place there by the
[24:13] time you met that person and here and
[24:15] there he's never like that he's always
[24:16] perfectly on time he's always got it all
[24:17] together amen that's the god that we
[24:19] serve um and I appreciated the songs
[24:21] this evening they were the opening one
[24:23] was um come now is the time to worship
[24:25] come now is the time to give your heart
[24:27] and the other one was um Lord I give you
[24:29] my heart and so my the the the word that
[24:32] I want to speak on tonight is heart last
[24:35] time I checked we've all got a heart do
[24:37] you have a
[24:39] heart it's good because you wouldn't be
[24:41] here if you're
[24:43] not the heart and and you know as
[24:46] Christians we're not going to talk about
[24:48] our natural heart although it's vitally
[24:49] important for us to sort of connect to
[24:51] this earth here but I want to talk about
[24:53] our spiritual heart and uh the Greek
[24:57] word apparently is cardus is that
[24:59] similar to like cardiac arist or
[25:00] something is it you know we think we're
[25:03] so smart us humans and US English people
[25:05] use all these Greek words to name our
[25:07] things you know and we call all the
[25:10] parts in our body a different or Latin
[25:11] or something you know it's like come on
[25:13] man say English if you're English say
[25:15] English but we like to show we're
[25:17] intelligent um but it's um it's the
[25:21] thoughts or the feelings and it's also
[25:23] the middle it's like your thoughts your
[25:25] feelings and everything kind of all put
[25:28] together is what we're going to call
[25:29] your heart
[25:31] so you've got this thing somewhere in
[25:34] you that's called your heart and it's
[25:37] it's the center of you it's it's
[25:38] everything that you are and it's it's
[25:40] it's all your thoughts it's all your
[25:41] feelings it's your emotions it's your
[25:43] it's it's it's basically everything
[25:44] that's you housed in this little place
[25:46] called your heart and I want to just
[25:48] take you through a few things about the
[25:50] heart and the first thing is is that the
[25:52] heart is actually a big big big place
[25:56] it's not a small place the heart's a
[25:58] very big place your heart's a very big
[26:00] place maybe there are places in your
[26:02] heart that You' never been to before
[26:04] your own heart brother Colin maybe
[26:06] places in his heart he's never been
[26:08] that's how big his heart is you could
[26:10] probably search your heart your whole
[26:11] life and never never quite find
[26:13] everywhere that's in it so the heart is
[26:15] a very very big place and as the Bible
[26:18] says here they search out iniquities
[26:20] they accomplish a diligent search both
[26:22] the inward thought of every one of them
[26:24] and the heart is deep or here's another
[26:26] scripture to make it a little bit um
[26:29] different more understandable they devis
[26:32] acts of Justice saying we are ready with
[26:34] the well-conceived plan for the inward
[26:35] thought and the heart of man are deep
[26:38] mysterious and
[26:40] unsearchable that's what lies in your
[26:42] heart an unsearchable
[26:44] place okay
[26:46] now but
[26:48] unfortunately as would be the fact that
[26:50] we are born in
[26:52] sin the unfortunate thing about this
[26:55] place is that it says the heart is
[26:56] deceitful above of all things and
[26:59] desperately wicked who can know
[27:03] it it's a because we're born in sin
[27:06] we're shapen in iniquity and we we came
[27:09] this way then this this heart that we've
[27:11] got has the ability to be such an evil
[27:13] place and and it by default is an evil
[27:16] place when we're born a heart is just
[27:19] evil and maybe when we're small only
[27:21] small evil things come out like we steal
[27:22] a cookie you know about some of those
[27:25] people that stole a cookie end up
[27:26] killing Millions cuz the heart can be in
[27:28] such an evil place and and and that the
[27:33] the heart is the reason why it's so evil
[27:36] is because it's it's just born evil but
[27:38] it's also got the ability for spirits to
[27:39] come and manifest themselves inside this
[27:41] place we call the
[27:43] heart but it's not all evil but I'm
[27:45] saying that the evil these evil things
[27:48] can't really go into this water here and
[27:50] make and express itself but it's got the
[27:53] ability to come into us and express
[27:56] itself it's the heart can be deceived it
[27:59] can be manipulated all these things can
[28:00] happen in the human heart to make the
[28:03] human heart can start to think good is
[28:04] evil and evil is good it can be
[28:06] manipulated the human heart it's a very
[28:09] interesting place the things that go on
[28:11] in the human heart a and and and this
[28:15] scripture here is about when Jesus was
[28:18] going to be um sold to the Pharisees and
[28:23] Judas was going to betray him it says
[28:26] that he said Jesus said whoever takes a
[28:28] so and eats it he'll be the one and and
[28:30] Judas did it and then it said as soon as
[28:32] he'd finished that then it said Satan
[28:34] entered into him went into his heart and
[28:38] Jesus said unto him that thou do us do
[28:39] quickly so this heart's got the ability
[28:41] that can it can be so evil if if we so
[28:45] let it and yet there's another scripture
[28:47] here that
[28:48] says the opposite that says that Christ
[28:51] May dwell in your hearts by faith that
[28:54] ye being rooted and grounded in love so
[28:56] the heart has also got the ility to
[28:58] invite the spirit of God in and God
[29:00] could come down into our heart into this
[29:02] place we call the heart and begin to do
[29:04] a fantastic work in our
[29:06] hearts and on that note we understand
[29:10] then that God has this great being that
[29:12] fills all time and space that actually
[29:13] has an interest in the human heart it's
[29:16] one of his most interesting places to go
[29:18] is down into the human heart it's
[29:19] actually his most interesting place of
[29:22] all the places on the whole the Earth he
[29:24] doesn't go up in the hills somewhere he
[29:25] doesn't go there he goes into the human
[29:27] heart and he loves to search out the the
[29:30] human heart to go he's got a torch and
[29:32] he he walks down in there and he
[29:33] searches around in the human heart to
[29:35] see what's in there it says I the Lord
[29:37] search the heart I try the Reigns even
[29:39] to give every man according to his ways
[29:41] and according to the fruit of his doings
[29:44] 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a
[29:47] year God is searching every single heart
[29:50] daily searching the heart can you
[29:53] imagine how wonderful he feels when he
[29:55] sees a good
[29:56] heart he feels so happy
[29:58] wow look what's
[30:01] here I believe I'll
[30:05] stay that's why David said search me oh
[30:08] God and know my heart try me and know my
[30:11] thoughts Lord come and search me imagine
[30:13] God's even invited Lord then search me
[30:16] if you're the great Searcher search me
[30:17] bring your big Spotlight of the word of
[30:19] God and search my heart search my spirit
[30:21] search my motive search my intention
[30:23] search everything that I Am Lord search
[30:24] me it's such a wonderful thing the Lord
[30:28] and you know life's
[30:30] experiences and all your assessments of
[30:33] them and everything that they are all
[30:34] get housed down inside your heart every
[30:37] single thing every thought everything
[30:40] that came to you everything that went
[30:41] from you everything every place you
[30:43] existed in every emotion you felt
[30:45] everything you heard that's right
[30:48] everything you thought everything you
[30:50] remembered everything you said
[30:51] everything it's all just housed in this
[30:53] place called the human heart it's this
[30:55] fantastic place but everything that you
[30:57] are how's
[30:59] there and I want to say this the heart
[31:02] is actually a it's a dynamic place that
[31:05] actually gives and receives it doesn't
[31:07] just sit stagnant and not do anything
[31:10] it things come in and things go out it
[31:13] it it moves it's alive this hard things
[31:15] happen in it that's cuz the if the Lord
[31:18] said Thou shalt love the Lord God with
[31:19] all your heart if something can come out
[31:22] of your heart then something can come
[31:23] back into it if love can go out then
[31:25] love can come back in if Joy can can go
[31:28] out joy can come back in if hope can go
[31:30] out then hope can come back in it's a
[31:31] dynamic place it doesn't just sit there
[31:33] stagnant like a stagnant pool that just
[31:35] sits there to rot it's
[31:37] Dynamic and unfortunately at the same
[31:39] time that that if if someone lets it
[31:42] there can be Evil coming out but we can
[31:43] praise God we're right into that and
[31:45] another fantastic thing on this Bas is
[31:47] that it's so Dynamic that it can be
[31:48] renewed the human heart can be renewed
[31:51] if it's if it's old and run down it can
[31:53] be
[31:55] renewed it can be changed God's Got
[31:58] ability to come in hearts and change
[31:59] them to to come into this place with
[32:01] this torch and figure out what needs to
[32:02] be done and change it for the better
[32:04] that's what God can do in the human
[32:05] heart he's such a wonderful God and he
[32:07] says a new heart also will I give you
[32:09] and a new spirit I will put within you
[32:11] and I'll take you out the Stony heart of
[32:13] your flesh and I'll give uh Stone your
[32:15] heart out of your flesh and I'll give
[32:16] you a heart of Flesh I'll change your
[32:19] heart you realize we can't even change
[32:21] our own Hearts we don't have the ability
[32:23] to come in and change it we didn't even
[32:24] know where it is we can't even find our
[32:27] heart where is where's my heart where
[32:29] does it
[32:30] lay can I go
[32:32] there but you can't God go there search
[32:36] me find me Lord sa if there be some
[32:39] Wicked way of me Lord and he can change
[32:41] it all for the better if we don't let
[32:43] him he says to give to appoint unto them
[32:46] in Zion to give unto them Beauty for
[32:48] Ashes if he's these ashes there he can
[32:50] make Beauty there if he sees mourning if
[32:53] he sees a heart to in mourning he's got
[32:55] the ability to make it joyful to give it
[32:57] the Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[33:00] heaviness if someone's heavy he can
[33:02] change it to
[33:03] praise that spirit that can weigh down
[33:06] our heart to make your heart so heavy to
[33:08] to almost pull down your whole being
[33:10] that to just drag you down he can put
[33:12] that off you he can strive that thing
[33:14] away and give you the the Garment of
[33:15] Praise that's the god that we serve this
[33:18] morning and that's uh this evening
[33:19] that's why David said Lord create in me
[33:21] a Clean Heart Lord do this to me give me
[33:23] give me the oil of Joy oh God for the
[33:26] spirit of heaviness Lord God
[33:28] that's the god that we serve this
[33:30] evening the god that can change our
[33:31] hearts that can renew us that can make
[33:33] us a new
[33:34] hallelujah praise the Lord and then and
[33:37] then we have this fantastic ability
[33:40] we're in possession of this heart we've
[33:41] got this fantastic ability that we can
[33:43] take all of that heart that we know cuz
[33:46] we don't know how big it is we can take
[33:47] whatever it is and say Lord here can you
[33:49] have this Lord here's my heart isn't
[33:52] there a song Here's My Heart Lord we can
[33:54] say Lord take my heart Lord put it in
[33:57] your hands God take my heart and then
[34:00] what does God say he says cast all your
[34:01] cares upon me for I care for you give me
[34:04] your heart and I'll care for you I'll
[34:06] make sure it doesn't get run down and
[34:08] ruined I'll care for you give me that
[34:10] heart I'll care for it I'll love it I'll
[34:13] look after it Hallelujah that's the god
[34:15] that we serve he doesn't he doesn't just
[34:17] get it and throw it aside somewhere who
[34:18] cherishes it cares for it that's the god
[34:21] that we
[34:22] serve and when we get into places like
[34:25] like what David said he said from the
[34:26] end of the Earth will I Cry when my
[34:28] heart is
[34:29] overwhelmed lead me to the Rock that's
[34:31] higher than I oh God when I'm
[34:33] overwhelmed when I just feel like I
[34:35] can't go on Lord care for me Lord lead
[34:37] me to the Rock that's higher than
[34:39] I what a God that we serve and yet and
[34:43] yet through all that we actually realize
[34:45] that you know see it seems like well
[34:47] it's this bit complicated thing you know
[34:50] it sounds quite complicated you know but
[34:52] really that the way that life is though
[34:54] it's actually quite simple you know we
[34:57] God's made it that things can be so
[34:59] complex but so simple at the same
[35:01] time it's the heart's actually very
[35:03] simple you just are your heart that's
[35:07] where he says as water reflects as water
[35:09] as in water face reflects face so a
[35:12] man's heart reveals a man saying he's
[35:15] basically saying if you look at a guy
[35:16] you look at his
[35:17] heart that's how simple it is you want
[35:19] to see his heart that's in there if he's
[35:21] happy his heart's happy if he's down his
[35:23] heart's down if he's angry his heart's
[35:25] angry that's simple
[35:28] you just look at it and that's it it's
[35:30] not it's nothing mysterious at oh he was
[35:32] like that but then his heart's really
[35:34] over there somewhere no it's what it is
[35:35] what it is that's him does that make
[35:38] sense now now as a result of that that
[35:42] that every day then we deal directly
[35:44] with human hearts that's actually what
[35:46] we deal with and and and whether you're
[35:49] rich poor whatever you are it doesn't
[35:52] matter you got the heart the same as
[35:54] everyone else and people deal with your
[35:55] heart the same as everyone else it's you
[35:57] understand what I'm trying to say is
[35:59] it and and the thing about this human
[36:02] heart is that they they respond
[36:05] best to to to love to care to to
[36:12] compassion understanding
[36:14] encouragement this heart will respond if
[36:16] you if you deal with a human heart like
[36:18] that it'll respond it'll give you you'll
[36:20] get a favorable response there'll be
[36:21] something in their heart that goes wow
[36:22] what's this I like this and you deal
[36:26] directly with human hearts every single
[36:28] day when you shake someone's head when
[36:29] you talk to them you're dealing directly
[36:31] with this thing that's called their
[36:32] heart and you're part of that Dynamic of
[36:34] their heart of this going in and coming
[36:36] out you're part of the sewing into their
[36:38] heart for that day when you see them
[36:39] when brother Aman say someone's awesome
[36:42] that goes into their heart and they
[36:44] think I'm
[36:45] awesome and you do a good
[36:48] thing and it's good to if you know
[36:51] Hearts it's good to encourage people I'm
[36:52] saying that because you we should
[36:53] encourage Hearts like there was a
[36:56] forgive me H but there was a guy that
[36:57] was going to be shf uh he wanted to cook
[36:59] pizzas at the at the
[37:00] cafe and um I met him once and I really
[37:04] liked this guy I thought man this is a
[37:05] neat guy he's just a really he's got
[37:07] something in him he's real I liked him
[37:09] he's I I I saw his heart he's a neat guy
[37:10] this guy and and he really wanted to
[37:12] work there but he was a bit despondent
[37:15] cuz he hadn't had a job for so long he
[37:17] was a bit down on himself but I kind of
[37:19] realized he wants to give it his best
[37:21] shot and he wants to make it work and he
[37:23] and he wants to achieve this thing but I
[37:26] didn't really get a chance to have much
[37:27] to do with as he was being trained in
[37:28] the first few weeks so I kind of uh
[37:31] wasn't really a part of his uh
[37:35] Early Times there and I was there for
[37:39] maybe one or two times but he he started
[37:42] to go uh the people started going a bit
[37:46] negative on him started say man this
[37:47] guy's actually no good he ain't going to
[37:49] make it you know you started to have to
[37:51] talk more more and more this guy ah he's
[37:52] going all he was bit funny tonight
[37:53] getting a bit angry and he was just
[37:55] going downhill this
[37:59] and sort of when people start talking
[38:01] like that that means they want to get
[38:02] rid of this guy like you know he's and
[38:04] the the chatter gets louder and louder
[38:05] and louder till you kind of have to go
[38:07] oh well
[38:09] goodbye but I thought no no no I know
[38:12] that guy I only met him twice but I know
[38:15] that guy I know his heart I thought to
[38:17] myself you the problem here is you're
[38:19] not you're not dealing with this man's
[38:20] heart in his heart he wants to you got
[38:23] to get to his heart and he'll be fine
[38:25] he'll be fine so I said leave him with
[38:28] me for a couple of nights man I've got
[38:29] this guy I got
[38:33] him and I dealt with his
[38:36] heart you're awesome bro you got it man
[38:38] look at that cool good you made a
[38:40] mistake don't worry about it don't worry
[38:42] ah we all do man I make mistakes all the
[38:44] time you should have seen me when I
[38:45] started who I'm burning everything don't
[38:47] worry about it and over Day Day and day
[38:50] after this day after that day after the
[38:52] day of doing this this man started to
[38:55] feel good again he just started to get
[38:56] better and better and better until now
[38:59] he's he's he's topnotch why because you
[39:02] got to deal with somebody's heart deal
[39:05] with their heart don't just not realize
[39:07] their heart is there deal with their
[39:09] heart and wonders in your life if you
[39:11] got children friends anyone deal with
[39:13] their heart and love them like give them
[39:16] a genuine love and it will change them
[39:18] and will change how they view you
[39:20] they'll love you even someone that hates
[39:23] you will love
[39:25] you when a man's ways please the Lord
[39:27] even his enemies will be at peace with
[39:31] him I want to say
[39:34] this you can you can also if you don't
[39:37] watch it we like to encourage other
[39:39] people you can also discourage your own
[39:40] heart anyone ever done that I'm no
[39:44] good you're discouraging your own
[39:47] heart because the Bible says as a man
[39:49] thinks in his heart so is
[39:51] he so if you think you're no good then
[39:54] it technically you are no good
[39:57] because whatever you think is what you
[39:59] are and and and it's such a
[40:01] disappointing place to get to where you
[40:03] just speak down to your heart you just
[40:06] discourage your own heart I don't think
[40:08] Jesus would come along and tell you
[40:09] you're no
[40:11] good so why do you tell yourself you're
[40:13] no good who's telling that who's saying
[40:15] that like if you wanted to play an
[40:17] instrument but someone always told you
[40:18] I'm no good I'll never do it chances are
[40:20] you'll never do it because you are what
[40:22] you
[40:23] think I'm telling you that because it's
[40:25] you you cannot discourage your own heart
[40:27] I know sometimes it's hard when you get
[40:28] down about something you think man I'm
[40:30] such an idiot I'm just no good I'm never
[40:31] going to amount to nothing but don't
[40:33] listen to that please man don't
[40:35] discourage your own
[40:38] heart David showed an example when when
[40:40] he left Zig and and he went off and
[40:43] fought and then zigg got burnt and
[40:44] everything was taken and the men were
[40:46] going to Stone him that's right yeah
[40:49] amen instead of getting down about it
[40:50] what did David
[40:51] do he encouraged himself in the Lord he
[40:54] said in his heart it's going to be all
[40:56] right in his heart no wor don't worry
[40:58] about this David God's got you you're
[41:02] all right David come on man keep going
[41:05] go David you can do this just Rejoice
[41:07] move forward God will overcome he
[41:10] encouraged his
[41:12] heart he encouraged his heart and he
[41:15] overcame it would have been the opposite
[41:17] if he discouraged his heart there's a
[41:19] scripture that says two are better than
[41:20] one because they have a good reward for
[41:22] their labor but if for if they fall the
[41:25] one will lift up his fellow husband and
[41:26] wife you know have you noticed that most
[41:28] of the time only one's down at the same
[41:30] time such a good scheme you know very
[41:33] rarely are two down at the same time cuz
[41:35] then it's like man I'm on the dumps and
[41:36] then the other person's like I am too
[41:37] down you go usually one person's doing
[41:39] all right you know you're like man I've
[41:41] had a bad day you've had a what I've had
[41:42] a wonderful day really and you encourage
[41:44] each other but the Bible says here but
[41:47] woe to him that is alone when he falleth
[41:49] for he ha not another to help him up and
[41:52] if you fall and you're alone and then
[41:53] you're down and then and you and you
[41:54] can't even lift up your own heart What a
[41:57] Sad hard place to be that you you can't
[42:00] even lift up your own heart and you're
[42:02] just down and and you just can't get
[42:03] yourself out of
[42:05] that oh Lord lead me to the Rock that's
[42:08] higher than I sometimes only it can it's
[42:10] only God that can go there and lift you
[42:11] up say it's all right and I've had that
[42:14] before many
[42:16] times I want to go through this keep
[42:19] this concept of the heart it says keep
[42:22] thy heart with all diligence for out of
[42:23] it are the issues of life or in other
[42:25] words Above All Else guard your heart
[42:27] for everything you do flows from it or
[42:30] guard your heart above all else for it
[42:32] determines the course of your
[42:34] life look after your heart look after it
[42:38] don't let it be a negative evil place
[42:39] don't let it be a down place let it be a
[42:41] happy place say God fill my heart with
[42:44] joy make make me happy Lord Make Me
[42:45] positive don't let it be a negative
[42:47] Place guard it remember you are what you
[42:50] think guard your heart I can sure as
[42:52] anything guarantee you God does not want
[42:54] your heart to be
[42:55] negative he doesn't want it to be down
[42:57] and negative he wants it to be positive
[42:59] he he wants to love you he wants you to
[43:01] know in your heart I'm
[43:03] awesome oh brother you sure I'm positive
[43:06] cuz if I was if he was standing right
[43:08] here he would tell me I'm
[43:11] awesome so why can't I tell
[43:14] myself is that
[43:16] right a merry heart does good like a
[43:19] medicine but a broken Spirit dries the
[43:21] bones you think God wants you to have
[43:23] dry bones you R Dry Bones back to life H
[43:27] in the valley of dry
[43:28] bones he's in the business of raising
[43:31] Dry Bones back up so why would he why
[43:33] would he want to have you down and be be
[43:36] dry
[43:37] bones he wants you have a Mery heart so
[43:39] it's you're you're just refreshing
[43:41] itself cuz because this this whole can I
[43:44] just talk a little bit about this little
[43:45] heart thing right here's a funny concept
[43:48] for you even in laughter the heart is
[43:52] sorrowful quite a powerful concept right
[43:55] have you thought about this before
[43:57] you can be very depressed about
[43:59] something very depressed and and it's
[44:00] heavy on you but go to a even go to
[44:02] church or go to a a group social
[44:04] Gathering where it's happy
[44:06] or watch a play that's happy or do
[44:08] something that's happy and you can laugh
[44:10] and genuinely laugh at that occasion or
[44:13] what what you're watching or what you're
[44:14] a part of you can laugh and genuinely
[44:17] laugh but in your heart you're still
[44:21] sad so that's why Solomon
[44:24] says even in in
[44:27] laughter the heart can be sorrowful but
[44:30] you know what but you know you know want
[44:31] to know something about it if it's the
[44:33] other way around you can't be sad if
[44:36] you're
[44:38] happy when you're happy you know when
[44:41] someone's trying to be serious and
[44:42] you're just so happy they're like they
[44:43] have to tell you hey bro can you just
[44:44] calm down we're supposed to be a bit
[44:46] serious here like what happens to admand
[44:48] all the time you know we're trying to be
[44:50] serious and he's and he's all just
[44:52] joking because he's so happy but he'll
[44:55] have to pretend now that he's
[44:58] that he's that right he can't genuinely
[45:01] be down when he's happy but you can
[45:04] genuinely be happy when you're down you
[45:07] ever thought about that
[45:09] that's a merry heart maketh a cheerful
[45:12] countenance but by sorrow of the heart
[45:13] the spirit is broken or in other words a
[45:15] happy heart makes the face cheerful but
[45:18] heartache crushes the spirit I don't
[45:20] believe God wants us to have
[45:22] heartache so if you see someone with
[45:23] heartache just encourage them help them
[45:25] it's all right bro it's all right we're
[45:28] good you're good man it's all right we
[45:31] don't want heartache in our and and
[45:33] amongst us we don't want sorrow we want
[45:37] joy I'm just going to read you
[45:39] this heart disease and depression often
[45:42] carry overlapping symptoms such as
[45:44] fatigue low energy and difficulty in
[45:46] sleeping and Carry On The Daily rhythms
[45:48] of Life basically what they're saying is
[45:51] if you've got depression you've
[45:52] generally get heart disease or it drags
[45:54] you down it they all go
[45:57] this natural thing that could weight us
[45:59] down and our spirit then affects our
[46:01] body which is what we read
[46:03] before here's one maintaining a positive
[46:05] attitude about treatment and holding the
[46:07] belief that our actions can have a
[46:08] beneficial effect on our own health are
[46:10] very important in other words they're
[46:12] saying uh a Mery heart does good like a
[46:15] medicine that's what they that's what
[46:17] they're saying without admitting that
[46:18] they want to say it a Mary heart does
[46:20] good like a medicine but a broken Spirit
[46:22] dth the
[46:24] bones I just want to move on now one
[46:27] thing that you have to always check are
[46:28] your intentions and the motives of your
[46:30] heart because they just come out and do
[46:32] what they do or actually sometimes they
[46:34] don't quite come out but that's there I
[46:36] really want to do this but I
[46:40] shouldn't I never do that but you guys
[46:44] do now when I do do that I say well
[46:47] what's that why is that there and what
[46:50] if I let that come out what would it
[46:51] achieve and it if achieved bringing
[46:53] someone down or making them worse off I
[46:55] think then what sort of spirit am off
[46:58] where that where does that thing come
[47:00] from and I can I give you a powerful
[47:03] very powerful analogy of that is that
[47:05] all
[47:06] right if I feel any sort of animosity to
[47:10] anybody here in my heart but I don't
[47:12] admit it but it's a little bit of
[47:13] animosity or something meaning that I
[47:15] want to bring them down just
[47:17] slightly like I want Josh to only play
[47:19] the
[47:20] guitar uh instead of eight times a month
[47:23] seven times a month cuz I'm getting a
[47:25] bit M he's getting he's he's a he's
[47:28] getting near my skill level we can't
[47:30] have
[47:33] this sounds trival but yeah and I want
[47:35] to I'm going to take one away from him
[47:37] just so we can just hold this back for a
[47:39] bit longer cuz I
[47:41] just and then I do the schedule and okay
[47:44] we just cross Josh out from the
[47:47] Wednesday now I have to be honest with
[47:49] myself and say where did that come from
[47:51] that's right cuz I've got some sort of
[47:53] desire in me to want to bring him down
[47:55] slightly
[47:57] let me tell you something that will
[47:58] shock you that spirit that does that is
[48:01] the tip of the iceberg that Spirit wants
[48:03] to absolutely kill him ma him slash him
[48:05] to death rip him apart and Chuck him
[48:06] down in the gutter and that he and gone
[48:09] forever that's what it wants to do it's
[48:12] just manifesting itself in a tiny little
[48:14] way the
[48:15] guitar that's what that spirit is that's
[48:18] the end of it if it had its way and some
[48:20] people it takes them over so much that
[48:22] they do that these killers they do that
[48:24] because the spirit can just it does that
[48:26] but I got the same one if I don't want
[48:28] them
[48:28] to seven instead of eight guitar plays
[48:31] it's exactly the same thing it's no
[48:33] different because it's anything that
[48:35] anything that comes in you that desires
[48:37] to pull someone else down just a little
[48:38] bit is from the pit of Hell and it's
[48:41] that spirit that wants to absolutely
[48:42] destroy you and everything you love
[48:45] hands down no question about it so if
[48:48] there's any sort of intention in your
[48:49] heart that ever does that I'll be real
[48:51] quick and say Lord search me where's
[48:53] that thing hiding where's it hiding I
[48:56] saw it you just saw it in the corner of
[48:59] your eye Lord I saw that where is it
[49:00] hiding Lord bring your search light and
[49:02] find that thing and God will search it
[49:05] he'll on the Sunday someone will preach
[49:06] the word of God and it'll go right down
[49:08] there it'll catch it out where it is
[49:09] you'll say there it is I want that
[49:11] gone that's the god that we serve he
[49:13] searches the
[49:14] hearts
[49:17] amen amen is that all
[49:21] right the Lord knows in my heart I don't
[49:24] have any ill intention for anybody ever
[49:27] never I I can't let it get past my
[49:30] thinking process to think do I want Josh
[49:33] absolutely Torn to Pieces and cast aside
[49:36] no then why would I ever think any sort
[49:38] of thing that would bring him down just
[49:39] a tiny tiny bit why would I ever let
[49:42] that come into my heart what spirit is
[49:43] that of certainly not the spirit of God
[49:46] I can assure you of that we want the
[49:48] spirit of God that loves that encourages
[49:50] that's compassionate that wants to build
[49:52] up that edifies that that is happy when
[49:54] someone else does better than us happy
[49:57] my children tell me all the time I'll be
[49:59] better than you soon I'm like that's so
[50:00] good man can you put it in
[50:03] writing or people at work you know that
[50:05] like my my mate William Will I Am you

[50:43] proud he's like wo here they
[50:47] go that's what he thinks I'm not making
[50:49] this up because what does love do it
[50:51] wants to build up and if he's the
[50:54] Fountain of all love the source of all
[50:56] love that comes for forth then what are
[50:57] his thoughts going to be towards you

[51:02] today oh but they failed in that St
[51:05] thing for years I don't
[51:07] care
[51:09] and here we go at the end of the day if
[51:12] it's a big failure he's so
[51:15] proud another day

[51:19] actually no I to destroy them his own
[51:23] yeah never he'll never think that of you
[51:26] never will that thing that tells you
[51:28] that is a liar in your heart it's a
[51:30] total liar it's just Satan wants to
[51:32] bring you down CU this whole he's in the
[51:33] game the business of bringing people
[51:35] down that's all he knows how to do to
[51:37] destroy to pull down but God's in the
[51:38] business of creating and renewing and
[51:40] making us amen just don't get a big kid
[51:42] though you think you're all good
[51:45] okay that was a joke is that right you
[51:48] know when you go on in the Lord you
[51:50] realize Lord if it wasn't for you I'd be
[51:51] nothing but then I don't
[51:53] let but then when the devil says I so
[51:55] you're nothing then I'm like no I'm not
[51:57] nothing no no no no no no I'm not
[52:00] talking to you I'm talking to the Lord
[52:03] when I talk to you I'm a mighty
[52:05] conqueror I'm a
[52:07] lion I'm an overcomer no weapon formed
[52:10] against me will prosper that's what I
[52:11] talk to how I talk when I talk to you
[52:14] I'm Victorious
[52:16] undefeatable oh God I'm a sinner Lord
[52:19] help me Lord Lord I'm unworthy Lord uh I
[52:23] fail every day Lord forgive me help me
[52:25] Lord that's how I am before the Lord but
[52:27] not before my
[52:29] enemy before my enemy I'm a mighty
[52:31] warrior Fearless in
[52:34] battle is that all you got is that all
[52:37] you got beat me down on the carpet is
[52:39] that all you
[52:42] got Bring It
[52:44] On can I just talk about this for a
[52:46] minute the heart of a
[52:48] man
[52:49] the seems to be that a man's heart is
[52:52] slightly different than a woman's heart
[52:53] Naturally
[52:54] Speaking because in a heart housed all
[52:57] of your
[52:58] emotions and your being you know and and
[53:02] a man has this ability now the woman's
[53:04] heart is
[53:06] fantastic but I need to talk about this
[53:08] because it's
[53:10] types the man's heart does have the
[53:13] ability a bit more to be a bit more
[53:14] stable a bit more steadfast would you
[53:17] agree like it can sort of hold the for
[53:19] slightly better like a man could be the
[53:22] same if you choose to you could be
[53:24] exactly the same sort of guy for the
[53:26] next 365 days exactly the same all day
[53:28] every day and you know you could the
[53:31] only thing that would affect you is if
[53:33] if you let outside circumstances affect
[53:35] your being but if you didn't let them
[53:38] you you've got the ability to just be
[53:40] the same all the time CU you're you're
[53:43] you don't you're not plagued plagued
[53:46] you're not run so much by your emotions
[53:49] you rule over them slightly more that
[53:51] makes sense so so the man's heart can
[53:53] actually is slightly stronger but that
[53:55] but we know that anyway because God's
[53:57] heart is slightly stronger than our
[53:59] heart very much very strong you know and
[54:01] it's us that go to God and say Lord I'm
[54:03] just I was so happy this morning now
[54:06] Lord Look at me now you know but the
[54:08] Lord's always the same he's got a strong
[54:10] heart and he cares but but the heart of
[54:13] a man though should should actually
[54:16] reflect and the Heart of a woman but I
[54:18] just want to do this to type because I'm
[54:19] going somewhere with this okay you
[54:21] understand it it it should actually
[54:23] reflect God and and be this be a sound
[54:25] heart like it it should be humble be uh
[54:29] these are just a few examples be kind it
[54:31] should be caring uh fear shouldn't be
[54:34] unfear it should be fear it should be um
[54:37] Dependable should be able to it should
[54:39] be strong and dependable like you can
[54:41] rely that it's going to be the same the
[54:42] next day when you talk to it it's going
[54:43] to be this heart's going to be strong it
[54:45] should be loyal uh it should be
[54:48] courageous man it should be all these
[54:50] God makes a man's heart like this and
[54:53] it's for a purpose because we get put on
[54:55] this Earth we have to then deal with
[54:57] human hearts and and this to me is one
[55:00] of the it's one of the most amazing it's
[55:04] an amazing journey in life and yet it's
[55:06] one of the most could I say I think I
[55:09] could say absurd that we can have
[55:11] children and have to be a
[55:12] father because I think Lord do you
[55:14] realize who I am I'm just
[55:18] honestly me and I'm supposed to be this
[55:21] figure this person to and and and be a
[55:25] father like you are to me I'm supposed
[55:26] to be that to these children you're
[55:27] talking about me I can't even sort
[55:30] myself out and yet before I not I've got
[55:32] me personally I've got five that are
[55:33] supposed to be like this you know some
[55:36] days I've sat back and thought this is a
[55:38] cruel Joke
[55:39] Man and it actually is because it wasn't
[55:42] designed that way I wasn't actually
[55:44] designed to really be a father but yet
[55:46] God in his great wisdom allows me to
[55:48] live through it so I can understand him
[55:50] as a father and I I can I can start to
[55:52] see types of things that so so I know I
[55:55] understand there reasons why we go
[55:56] through it but but still then I I end up
[55:59] dealing with the heart of a child now
[56:01] the heart of a child is a very very
[56:02] precious thing because you understand
[56:05] with the heart of a child it's for for
[56:07] the first portion of their life it's
[56:09] generally just one way and that's
[56:11] straight into
[56:12] them when you get older you can decide
[56:14] what comes and what comes out and change
[56:16] your circumstances change your
[56:17] environment change this change that to
[56:18] protect your heart when you're young
[56:20] it's one way and that's into you you
[56:22] don't have a choice you just get
[56:24] whatever wherever you born and whatever
[56:27] situation you're born in it just gets
[56:28] fed into you and you have no control
[56:30] over really what comes into your heart
[56:33] so if you have children my best advice I
[56:36] could give to you is just love them and
[56:37] care for their heart and I loved what
[56:40] brother impo said I wish I had an this
[56:42] earli but he said he said his mother
[56:44] told him this he said look at that
[56:45] little baby that little child is exactly
[56:47] the same as you all it lacks is
[56:51] experience that little thing that big
[56:53] it's exactly like you it's fully grown
[56:55] it just lacks experience I thought man I
[56:58] find you that when they were
[57:00] younger I was very nice of it you
[57:03] know but remember you these these just
[57:06] love them like just just feed love unto
[57:09] them cuz we always mess up you know and
[57:12] we think we parent this way and that way
[57:13] and this other way and read all the
[57:14] books and everything ah just be yourself
[57:16] but love them CU that's really what is
[57:19] going to affect their heart that person
[57:20] loved me he loved me or she my mother
[57:23] loved me see I love my dad and you know
[57:26] one thing I love about my dad I knew my
[57:28] Dad loved me there was there's never a
[57:30] thought in my mind your dad didn't love
[57:32] you my dad didn't talk much or anything
[57:34] hardly at all and he but I knew my Dad
[57:36] loved me that's never been a question
[57:38] I've wor SP like a million bucks my dad
[57:40] loves me you don't have to succeed in
[57:42] nothing else my dad loves me and don't
[57:44] forget the power you've got on your
[57:45] children you know because especially
[57:47] when they're up to about seven or eight
[57:48] or nine or 10 dads and Ms especially
[57:51] dads though Sorry Ms but dads are like
[57:53] the cool guy and dads are the hero

[58:09] goodness they tell their friends they

[1:01:13] going to be loyal to
[1:01:15] that I Ain just going to hand it over to
[1:01:17] you I want to check what's in your heart
[1:01:19] what sort of heart have you
[1:01:21] got so that heart ain't going nowhere
[1:01:24] until I know it's going to a safe place
[1:01:28] and that's the way it should be this is
[1:01:29] the heart I'm talking about you tell me
[1:01:31] what what more valuable thing I could
[1:01:33] hold in my
[1:01:34] hand you tell me what's more valuable
[1:01:36] that I can hold in my hand but one of
[1:01:37] those hearts
[1:01:40] nothing that that's why when you get a
[1:01:43] heart of a wife it's such a I don't know
[1:01:45] I hope we Brothers realize what we get
[1:01:48] given when we get given a heart I hope
[1:01:50] we
[1:01:52] realize there is nothing greater in the
[1:01:55] whole wide world world than a human
[1:01:57] heart there's nothing there's nothing
[1:01:59] greater than it you tell me what there
[1:02:01] could be greater than it you do the math
[1:02:04] you work it
[1:02:05] out and to think that that Brothers we
[1:02:09] get this heart placed into our
[1:02:12] hand you're holding the most valuable
[1:02:14] thing that you're ever going to hold in
[1:02:16] your entire life right there in the palm
[1:02:18] of your
[1:02:19] hand that's the most valuable thing
[1:02:22] you're ever ever ever going to hold sir
[1:02:29] what do you think you're going to do
[1:02:30] with that no man you've been given a
[1:02:34] heart to look
[1:02:35] after care for it love it look after it
[1:02:40] be loyal to
[1:02:41] it don't mistreat it it's it's the it's
[1:02:44] honestly that you cannot put value on
[1:02:46] what you hold in your hand and the fact
[1:02:48] that someone else is willing to put
[1:02:49] theirs in your hand is
[1:02:50] outstanding when you think about
[1:02:53] it you you you'll never hold anything as
[1:02:56] valuable as that and I pray God that we
[1:02:57] understand that and we each day we
[1:02:59] realize that Lord what do I hold in my
[1:03:01] hand
[1:03:03] wow because that it goes on to a bigger
[1:03:07] picture here that God showing
[1:03:10] look I'm holding your heart in my
[1:03:13] hand and and when you think about it
[1:03:17] what's the most valuable thing that God
[1:03:20] has in his possession then on that
[1:03:24] basis what the most valuable thing God
[1:03:27] has in the whole of the
[1:03:30] universe it's exactly right it's you and
[1:03:32] I that's actually the most valuable
[1:03:34] thing that he holds in his hand is you
[1:03:35] and I because he we've given him our
[1:03:37] heart Lord I give you my
[1:03:39] heart we've given him our heart and he
[1:03:42] holds that heart in the palm of his hand
[1:03:45] and to him that's the most valuable
[1:03:47] thing in his whole world is that heart
[1:03:50] that's been placed in his
[1:03:52] hand that's why when
[1:03:57] what happens to us when we mistreat one
[1:03:59] of those hearts there you think about
[1:04:04] it that heart that God values above
[1:04:07] anything else and someone comes along
[1:04:08] and mistreats
[1:04:09] it
[1:04:11] the even speaks the wrong word until it
[1:04:13] tries to mess around with it it's such a
[1:04:17] a dangerous place to go when
[1:04:19] you begin to Tamper to harm This Heart
[1:04:25] that God has in the palm of his hand
[1:04:27] that he loves his bride something that
[1:04:29] he
[1:04:31] loves and if you look L to you and you
[1:04:34] look right to you or if you're no one's
[1:04:35] sitting next to you look up in front of
[1:04:37] you cuz that's me what you're looking at
[1:04:40] is the most valuable thing that God has
[1:04:43] in his possession is sitting right next
[1:04:45] to you that's it the most valuable thing
[1:04:48] that he has in his
[1:04:50] possession look after that thing if you
[1:04:53] want to please God look after that
[1:04:54] person sitting next to to
[1:04:56] you if you want to make God happy with
[1:04:58] you look after that heart be merciful to
[1:05:01] it if it's wrong say it's all right bro
[1:05:02] keep going encourage it love it because
