[0:00] I got a slow start to this day what is
[0:02] good and there must be something wrong
[0:04] with the agenda when they got me singing
[0:06] in front so good luck for all of us yeah
[0:11] it's just good i would just like to
[0:13] share what a testimony today every day
[0:17] is a hard day and we all battle the big
[0:20] fight in the long fight and things get
[0:23] busy but the u.s. today is the scripture

[0:27] there was a high of 40
[0:29] and all recently for me
[0:31] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[0:33] renew their strength and they shall
[0:36] mount up with wings
[0:38] they shall run and they shall not be
[0:41] weary and they shall walk and not faint
[0:44] so usually when we think everything is
[0:48] lost in our backs against the wall
[0:50] the Lord will just pick us up you know
[0:52] as long as we wait on him pick us up and
[0:54] give us three in each any said there is

[24:28] to turn with being your Bibles to
[24:29] Genesis chapter 25 I just want to
[24:34] take two scriptures here that we've read
[24:36] that we can never really
[24:38] I've gone into any great detail when I
[24:42] continued my thought about where we are
[24:43] on the end time and that's good to have
[24:46] you Lana down town oh god bless you it's
[24:48] good to have you here they wonderful
[24:50] these past few days having you here
[24:51] thank you for being here pray you'll be
[24:54] blessed tonight and we'll just go to
[24:57] justice chapter so Jeff here's the
[25:00] chapter 24 I'm worried vs 64 and 65
[25:09] and it's easier maybe we could read
[25:13] verse 63 as well and Isaac went out to
[25:15] meditate in the field of the Eventide
[25:17] and he lifted up his eyes and saw and
[25:19] behold the camels will come in and
[25:21] Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she
[25:24] saw Isaac she left she lighted off the
[25:27] camel for she had said unto the servant
[25:29] what manners us that walketh in the
[25:31] field to meet us and the servant had
[25:33] said it is my master therefore she took
[25:35] a veil and covered herself and I saw an
[25:38] will just read the last of us and the
[25:40] server told Isaac all the things that he
[25:41] had done and Isaac brought her into his
[25:44] mother series 10 and took Rebecca and
[25:46] she became his wife and he loved her and
[25:49] Isaac was comforted after his mother's
[25:51] dear I'm in may the lord blesses would
[25:53] you may have your seat
[25:58] now I'd like to take a portion of that
[26:00] just that verse there verse 65 where she
[26:05] says who is this he says she says what
[26:08] manners us that walketh in the field to
[26:10] meet us because you know as we were
[26:11] talking about on Sunday we see how the
[26:14] man of sin has been revealed in the stay
[26:16] but he is not really the main main one
[26:18] we're looking for because we have seen
[26:20] in this time that yo we we're in a
[26:23] season where where we are going to be
[26:25] with the Lord during the season of the
[26:26] catching away the bride Ernie and we see
[26:28] that you know owl because we understand
[26:31] this book of Genesis here this chapter
[26:33] of Genesis is a shadow of what we're
[26:35] living out and we understand that Isaac
[26:37] as a as a type of Christ he was he was
[26:40] the lamb that that Abraham was going to
[26:42] offer on on the altar he gave himself
[26:44] willingly and he was the promised son as
[26:47] Jesus is the promised son and we see
[26:49] Rebecca she she represents us in the US
[26:52] in the scripture where there's a there's
[26:54] a there's a called out people that
[26:56] become one with Jesus Christ and so
[26:58] there comes a time now where Rebecca
[27:01] finally laser eyes upon Isaac and she
[27:03] begins to ask who is this man that comes
[27:06] out to meet us and we see that as the
[27:08] church has walked two thousand years
[27:10] that finally Christ has become more of a
[27:12] living reality today and and it says in
[27:15] the scripture if we can go to 2nd
[27:17] Timothy we're young we begin to read
[27:20] we're sorry buddies find them my notes
[27:22] we begin to read where Paul speaks about
[27:25] a crown of life is laid up for him and
[27:28] if we go to second Timothy chapter 4 we
[27:31] go we reach this where you know second
[27:36] Timothy chapter 4 and verse a seven and
[27:40] eight and paula's Paula speaking Paul is
[27:43] speaking to Timothy because he
[27:45] understands that his thursday's upon the
[27:47] earth are numbered and he's his finishes
[27:50] course he says I fought a good fight I
[27:52] finished my course I have kept the faith
[27:54] therefore there is a crown laid up at
[27:58] can you turn this down please a
[28:00] henceforth there is a crown laid up for
[28:02] me there is laid up for me a crown of
[28:04] righteousness which the Lord the
[28:06] righteous judge shall give me at that
[28:08] day and not to me only but unto all of
[28:12] them also that love his appearing and we
[28:15] can see that as God has become what he
[28:17] has done in this end time as he has made
[28:20] here's he has begun to appear among us
[28:22] you know you see in the Ministry of the
[28:24] prophet of the Lord where God would come
[28:26] down and the services and people would
[28:27] say Bible days are here again and the
[28:29] sucker healed enough and in the very
[28:31] hearts of the people's lives were
[28:33] revealed in front of him and and the
[28:35] pillar of fire God Himself was was
[28:37] photographed there in the services of
[28:39] even as biggest critics there about the
[28:41] presence of that of that great God
[28:43] Himself Jesus Christ and they knew that
[28:45] he was there and that was God now was
[28:48] beginning to appear about his people and
[28:49] we see that even down 50-yard years down
[28:52] the road we should really ask the
[28:54] question who is this man amen who is
[28:57] this who is this unseen one that we feel
[29:00] among us not just every service but but
[29:03] in our homes who's this one who walks
[29:05] with us who is this great one I mean who
[29:09] is this unseen oneness this very king of
[29:11] glory that is that makes himself known
[29:14] among us a man that is that your comes
[29:17] our way Eddie Eddie and he heals the
[29:19] sick a many others the eyes of the blind
[29:21] and many quickens is worth to us amen he
[29:24] annoys us to to to live the scripture I
[29:28] mean who is this who is this man I'm
[29:30] sure you can see that as as time has
[29:32] gone on I trusted your Christian walk
[29:34] and Jesus Christ has become more real to
[29:37] you
[29:38] becoming brighter living reality as he
[29:41] has begin to appear among us and it's
[29:43] more than just now way just an
[29:45] introduction or maybe just hearing of
[29:46] him but now your eyes have actually
[29:48] fallen upon them because we understand
[29:51] that when the word is it becomes a
[29:52] living reality that is Jesus Christ
[29:54] benefiting himself and is when we see
[29:57] his would become manifest we can
[29:59] actually say we have seen Jesus project
[30:01] they met an end you know we we can say
[30:04] by the authority of God's what we have
[30:06] seen him amen we jaw is a time a week
[30:09] for physically meet him in the air and
[30:12] we know now was not yet that time but
[30:14] his spirit is working among us I'm in
[30:17] that very unseen one that was walking on
[30:19] the shores of Galilee in a body of flesh
[30:21] this is a little while and the World's
[30:23] End we know more but you shall see me he
[30:26] says I personal pronoun will be with you
[30:29] even in you to the end of the world this
[30:31] is all nothing if you come from list but
[30:33] I'll be with you guys pc and he's not
[30:36] saying a separate personal being one of
[30:37] you I myself a mental be worth
[30:40] you will be walking with you and we
[30:43] understand that this very God is you
[30:45] know this unseen one I trust you really
[30:49] think about it as you are every day that
[30:51] cause this one this is one that is that
[30:53] has turned my heart to serve Him who is
[30:56] this one that has changed me I mean who
[30:59] is this
[31:01] the book of Genesis that you know in the
[31:05] paul writing the book of Hebrews he says
[31:08] that Jesus Christ is him as the image of
[31:10] the invisible God and everything that
[31:13] you're the fool disregarded widely dwelt
[31:15] in Jesus Christ and we can see from the
[31:17] scripture that that God was reflecting
[31:20] himself through the prophets in part but
[31:23] then finally all that god was he caught
[31:25] himself into Jesus Christ and brother
[31:27] branham he would he would speak of a
[31:30] speak of a great sculpture and thus
[31:32] great sculpture was this sculpture of
[31:34] Moses and Michelangelo who was a great
[31:37] great artist in his day he he spent many
[31:39] years stop thickness first sculpture of
[31:42] Moses out of one piece of marble and and
[31:44] and a replica of this was was was made
[31:48] because the real ones in the Vatican but
[31:50] a replica was made and it was put in the
[31:52] forest lawn cemetery in the United
[31:54] States a lot of famous people are ya you
[31:57] know be readin and at brother bran would
[31:59] tell the story when he went to that
[32:00] cemetery and he saw the grave of aimee
[32:04] semple mcpherson the start of the 4th
[32:06] quit denomination and he went there and
[32:10] just gave thanks you know for her life
[32:11] and he on the work she did and then they
[32:14] said do you want to have a tour around
[32:16] around the cemetery and and and and that
[32:19] was showing of different grades of
[32:21] different famous people and then finally
[32:23] he saw this he saw this yo sculpture of
[32:26] Moses and and he would begin to look at
[32:28] that sculpture and you know that
[32:30] sculpture is very interesting to cause
[32:32] on on one of his thing
[32:34] Levinson's right knee there's a there's
[32:37] a chip out of its right knee and what
[32:38] and and the story goes that Michael
[32:41] enter he had was buying he had in his
[32:43] mind what what Moses should look like
[32:45] you know every artist has inspiration
[32:48] and and finally you know after many
[32:50] years of toiling and and here and and
[32:54] sculpting and shaping that piece of
[32:56] marble finally finally after many years
[32:59] in prison go he would look at look at
[33:03] his sports and what he mentioned his
[33:05] mind and become material and go go in
[33:07] front of it and he was so inspired so
[33:09] caught up with what his very thoughts
[33:12] had become material that he took the
[33:14] hammer he cried out speak because he
[33:15] thought life was in it and he struck the
[33:17] thing on the knee and and and there's a
[33:20] chip out of the need to the state
[33:21] because of that and brother branham said
[33:24] that the masterpiece because this was
[33:26] called Michelangelo's masterpieces
[33:27] brother branham would look at that
[33:29] sculptured he'd say a floor and the need
[33:32] is what made of the master
[33:34] it wasn't it wasn't how big Moses was
[33:37] how muscly was and you know order you
[33:39] know it's quite an incredible piece of
[33:41] work if you go away and Google effect by
[33:43] the Prophet didn't look at look at how
[33:45] great the sculpture was Greece hit the
[33:47] floor you know that marking the knee is
[33:50] what made it a masterpiece to her and
[33:52] because Michelangelo he was he was so
[33:55] inspired he believed life was in that
[33:57] thing he believed all he had to do was
[33:59] strike hit it who come to life and it
[34:01] would speak to him and that's why he
[34:02] struck it and and we see that a god
[34:05] through the Old Testament he was he was
[34:07] molding he was reflecting himself with
[34:10] Moses the lawgiver which was Christ
[34:12] revealing a part of himself you know he
[34:14] was in Joshua placing the people in the
[34:16] land and and and we see Jesus Christ and
[34:19] Joseph is a perfect type where you know
[34:21] he was he was spiritual and he was hated
[34:23] by his brethren and you know he'll solve
[34:25] for 30 pieces of silver and you know he
[34:27] was he was put in prison and you know yo
[34:30] the you know the butler died and then
[34:32] the outside you know the Baker died the
[34:34] butler was given us life just like Jesus
[34:36] Christ was on the cross and one thing
[34:38] was part into one thing with the hell
[34:40] and you know all these things and kind
[34:42] in finding he was exalted to the right
[34:44] hand of fear that at every need and then
[34:46] we Joseph can't down the street every
[34:48] knee had to battle Joseph it that's the
[34:50] same thing with our Lord that one day
[34:51] every knee must bow to the name of Jesus
[34:54] Christ and so we can see Jesus Christ
[34:57] and Joseph we can see him and David is
[34:59] who you are as a rejected King we can
[35:01] see him in Moses but you see him in
[35:02] Jeremiah all the prophets down all the
[35:04] way
[35:05] we can see him and then finally all of
[35:07] those reflections were gathered together
[35:09] then finally better the man Jesus Christ
[35:11] and so God was sculpting and shaping and
[35:15] then finally his very idea of the ideal
[35:17] man I mean you know more than just a
[35:20] prophet or more than just a king but
[35:22] here was the man thank God was going to
[35:25] come in flesh and he was going to
[35:26] represent to us at what a Christian
[35:28] should be and how Christian should
[35:30] should conduct themselves and and God
[35:33] was so just like Michelangelo he was so
[35:36] he was so inspired and so happy with
[35:39] body his thoughts had become flesh you
[35:41] know we understand that the Bible tells
[35:44] us the work from finish from the
[35:45] foundation of the world and God has seen
[35:47] even even Snoddy seen it played out in
[35:49] his mind and he knows the end from the
[35:51] beginning but it's one thing but yo yes
[35:54] just like us we think about something
[35:56] you know like we want to go do something
[35:58] and we planted in our mind and maybe we
[35:59] make reservations and we bought plane
[36:01] tickets and we do all these things but
[36:03] then finally win what you imagined has
[36:05] looked out in u.s. experiences or the
[36:07] wonderful thing and then finally God now
[36:10] he can see you know he can see what he
[36:12] had in his mind had become flesh amen
[36:15] and then finally he saw this one this
[36:17] goes this great masterpiece that he made
[36:19] and he was so inspired by what he saw
[36:21] thee that he hug him up on Calgary amen
[36:24] any causes a bit bruised and cause them
[36:26] to be wounded amen and just like the
[36:28] Prophet said now the floor and the knee
[36:30] is what made in the masterpiece now
[36:34] Jesus Jesus looked like any man he
[36:38] looked like a common man near the Bible
[36:39] cows and Isaiah chapter 53 that there
[36:43] was nothing over there when we
[36:45] we should desire me or some big handsome
[36:47] guy he wasn't some big blind six foot
[36:49] tall short yo a broad shoulder kind of
[36:51] guy here's a small little fella I mean
[36:54] he doesn't have any you know any
[36:56] physical formula think this is the king
[36:58] of Israel but there was a life of them
[37:01] that was different to every other member
[37:02] yo get it even walk upon the air we
[37:05] everyman thing that can't you see every
[37:07] other man and they felt Moses fell he he
[37:10] had his temporary structure requires
[37:11] your David felt you know even your even
[37:15] and her sincerity he said I'll never
[37:16] seen yo I keep the wood hand and my
[37:19] heart but I said not against go aboard
[37:20] and you know he had this great desire
[37:22] that he wanted yo I keep the law ever
[37:24] before my face and all these things he
[37:26] wrote those things down he was genuine
[37:28] and us and his belief but the thing is
[37:30] if a man is not you know if a person is
[37:33] not truly converted not you're truly not
[37:35] born again when sin comes their way
[37:37] temptation comes their way all that will
[37:39] be laid aside and their and their human
[37:41] natural try and grab try and grab that
[37:44] thing and we can see that in the life of
[37:46] Bathsheba now i mean- achiever here the
[37:49] sincere desire to serve god but then as
[37:51] soon as she he saw Bathsheba that all
[37:53] went to one side and he took what he
[37:55] wanted for that so every man fell and
[37:58] now here was a man who is a very
[38:00] different kind of man he had a hit an
[38:02] unusual
[38:03] we're you know we're we're a little
[38:05] virgin you know ladyhood could Isaiah go
[38:09] the prophecy big red maybe one day on yo
[38:12] baby one day the synagogue and a spoke
[38:15] to her heart of the kid a visitation of
[38:16] an angel and in the woods that prophet
[38:18] anchored into a room and then life came
[38:20] forth and get a very different kind of
[38:23] life and and the devil came against him
[38:25] in the deal had to retreat he could make
[38:28] us 14 and it's because there was a life
[38:31] in him there's a life of him that was
[38:33] being expressed at never a man speak
[38:35] like this man I mean ever a man took a
[38:38] took a kid's lunch yeah i took some
[38:40] loaves and fishes and we get to multiply
[38:43] the bread or multiply the fishes in it
[38:45] and it wasn't just fish was cooked fish
[38:47] mother's friends cook friend and he any
[38:50] fit fit thousands of people at a time
[38:52] every man had done these things every
[38:55] man and Pat had looked upon water like
[38:57] he did or curse the victorious to
[39:00] the store more yeah I never a man had
[39:02] done these kind of things and then
[39:03] finally finally now here was God's
[39:06] masterpiece and sleep now
[39:10] brother branham he says member the floor
[39:13] and what made the masterpiece
[39:16] it was you know I mean I mean you know
[39:19] is the mark underneath the floor that's
[39:21] what made the masterpiece now
[39:27] masterpiece I hope I can convey dusty
[39:29] it's not but wonder stand that God has
[39:32] interviewed antenna mr. being Gila as to
[39:35] being King and mr. be a savior a judge a
[39:38] priest a lamb all these things are in
[39:41] him but they can only be fully
[39:43] manifested when they put on flesh we see
[39:46] that young and the old testament there
[39:48] was the brass super because you are
[39:49] raised up and they look at that thinking
[39:52] that be healed without offer a lamb and
[39:54] this has been covered but and to all
[39:56] those who attributes of God being looked
[39:58] out in those things but only when thou
[40:00] fully put on flesh dad people could
[40:02] truly be heal the people would truly be
[40:04] safe from their sermon your people could
[40:06] truly be delivered when those attributes
[40:08] put on flesh and but those attributes
[40:11] were were were sealed up in a body amen
[40:16] all those things were sealed up in him
[40:19] and so there had to be something had to
[40:21] be done to release those things that the
[40:23] people could truly access in the way God
[40:27] and so down Jesus now he had to because
[40:30] he was our lamb he was he was our lamb
[40:32] he had to be offered you know here to be
[40:35] examined and he was found perfect party
[40:37] don't know yeah I can find no fault in
[40:39] thee and then finally he was you know by
[40:42] His stripes you know to the wounding of
[40:44] him by the word against him it was that
[40:51] was now that was now the chips off his
[40:53] back was now the floors now amen that
[40:56] now made him a real real masterpiece you
[40:59] understand because now there was a way
[41:01] that because he was emptying himself out
[41:03] I mean that without money or price
[41:05] people could receive eternal life people
[41:08] could receive healing I mean people
[41:10] could receive deliverance so now it was
[41:13] it was the floor and then his work that
[41:17] made of the masterpiece hey you're
[41:20] following me this all right I mean you
[41:22] understand what I'm saying it's just
[41:24] words but now the question is so now the
[41:28] question is what caused the wound what
[41:31] caused the words you say well as the
[41:34] Romans and their work
[41:35] all these things that that didn't cause
[41:38] the words amen that doesn't pause the
[41:41] world they cause the ones in a sense
[41:44] that they were used to cause the ones
[41:46] but they weren't the ultimate cause of
[41:47] the world you see what caused the world
[41:51] sit across the world amen then I can say
[41:55] what else cause the word you cause the
[41:57] word Amen when you look at him hanging
[42:00] on Calvary have you imagined it in your
[42:02] mind and in you cause those words you're
[42:05] the reason he went to Calvary you're the
[42:08] reason the wounds will cause not because
[42:11] of anyone asks you're the reason I mean
[42:13] you're the reason aside was river you're
[42:15] the reason that he did that he was mad
[42:17] beyond any other man cuz her life in
[42:20] there that had to be released and it was
[42:22] released for you I mean you lost the
[42:24] woods hallelujah you're the reason the
[42:27] higher on Calvary and his words made of
[42:29] the masterpiece they meant without you
[42:33] he couldn't be the true masterpiece why
[42:35] cuz there's a people you say why did he
[42:36] have to go there because there are some
[42:38] people that were born and son I mean the
[42:40] whole human race was in jail and they
[42:42] had to be set free and I think God could
[42:45] come down and pay the price and then not
[42:47] a prophet or not Moses or not enlarge or
[42:49] whoever it was but God had to become man
[42:52] he had to become our land amen that he
[42:55] could play the price that a life could
[42:57] be released out of him but the only way
[42:59] his life could be released out as that
[43:01] there was a wounding a min because blood
[43:04] had to be shared without the shedding of
[43:06] blood is no remission of sin amen see
[43:09] all the ones who called you're the
[43:11] reason he was wounded hallelujah I'm so
[43:14] glad he was wounded for me amen he was
[43:18] the he was the reason I mean you
[43:21] reason many high on Calvary because
[43:24] there was a life in him it had to be
[43:25] released and life had to be released
[43:28] they're coming to you and when it came
[43:31] into you God was saying i see no fault
[43:33] in these people i mean there are sinless
[43:35] people a man there they're covered by
[43:38] the blood hallelujah because he says a
[43:42] citizen hebrews chapter 24 as much then
[43:45] as the children are partakers of flesh
[43:47] and blood he also himself likewise took
[43:50] part of the same that through death he
[43:52] might destroy him that had the power of
[43:55] death that is the devil and deliver them
[43:57] who through fear of death were all their
[43:59] lifetime subject to bondage hallelujah
[44:03] so he took object I mean he took the
[44:06] form of man and he used it to yo that he
[44:10] would destroy the diplom self hallelujah
[44:13] Sinell now he is the master piece
[44:14] hanging on Calvary and his life was
[44:17] released and then 222 coming to a people
[44:21] and to transform those people Amen
[44:24] because now when we you know when when
[44:28] Rebecca now saw so Isaac come out out to
[44:32] out to meet her now you know gee that's
[44:36] was you know she didn't know Isaac it is
[44:39] a lamp no Isaac was the land that that
[44:41] that Abraham would have offered now and
[44:43] then now I just want to jump however
[44:46] many thousand years from that meeting go
[44:48] down to this day I mean where we see
[44:51] that yo we have advised two thousand
[44:53] years of Neil's of time now where we
[44:56] have we read in Revelations four and
[44:58] five we're now there's a call went for
[45:00] who is worthy to take the book who's
[45:03] worthy to make redemptions place who is
[45:05] worthy to buy back this this this this
[45:08] lost creation and john looked he said no
[45:11] man was found worthy here's up in heaven
[45:13] and he couldn't see any man worthy angel
[45:16] who were these sure they were but
[45:17] there's no man he could see and he begin
[45:19] to week because he realized that no one
[45:22] was was found worthy to take that book
[45:24] and to loose the seals and then and to
[45:27] you know to give what the contents of
[45:29] the book was and though almost found
[45:31] worthy and all oppression was in
[45:33] jeopardy he saw Jesus died on the cross
[45:36] I mean he saw the wooden of the Lamb he
[45:39] received that same life that was in him
[45:41] came into her so he experienced your
[45:44] salvation how's your health to be
[45:46] experienced but then when he couldn't
[45:48] see anyone worthy now to take you know
[45:51] to take the book and then finally if
[45:53] you're one of the elders said we've not
[45:56] job for the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[45:59] has prevailed he's been found worthy and
[46:01] then when he turned he saw Lamech
[46:04] stepped forth out of the eternities he
[46:06] could have said who is this laughs I
[46:08] mean who is this land that comes to meet
[46:10] me and here comes the land and we
[46:12] understand that lamb is Jesus Christ
[46:15] the only worthy one that had the right
[46:17] through her intentions plain bored I
[46:19] mean so then he then he took that book
[46:22] hallelujah he made in his own position
[46:24] he made it he made a part of his
[46:27] belongings I Louie he paid the price on
[46:29] Calvary when I she is now going to
[46:31] redeem everything now i'm going to lay
[46:33] claim a buffalo new to me maybe so now
[46:36] John begin to see a lamb advance from
[46:38] eternity because out you know program
[46:40] tells us he was in de seating in the
[46:42] eternity but now he advances falls into
[46:45] the vision amen to take the book and
[46:48] then we see now that he has done those
[46:50] sexy advance here's advice now from the
[46:53] eternities into the vision and job can
[46:55] see him now take that book hallelujah
[46:58] and then so finally you know we must
[47:01] understand that John is a symbol in the
[47:03] book as well I mean Giada's assemble in
[47:06] the book when here the you know the
[47:08] church ages has lifted up into heaven
[47:09] that is the bride brother brad says one
[47:12] man and a vision represents a whole
[47:13] group of people so John has taken up
[47:16] into heaven and that speaks of the
[47:17] rapture of the bride at the end of the
[47:19] ages of it I'm it's a job now as a
[47:21] symbol there in that scene Alleluia so
[47:25] then finally he sees the land step 4 I
[47:27] need to make redemptions place and then
[47:30] we can see now that that same that same
[47:33] scene of the land stepping forth to make
[47:36] claims now remember it's all symbolic
[47:38] but it has to be looked out as well I
[47:40] mean we've seen I trust you can say I've
[47:42] seen the lamb step forth and then I've
[47:45] seen the lab step forth and lay claim to
[47:47] me hallelujah because when when Jesus
[47:50] comes in and he speaks to your heart and
[47:54] Eddie and he tries to get up i wants to
[47:57] get ahold of you and you maybe feel
[47:59] conviction come upon you and you give
[48:02] yourself to him you want a seven with
[48:04] all of your life that is a land coming
[48:06] to make claim to you I mean saying you
[48:09] belong to me once you belong to the
[48:11] devil but you would never mean to belong
[48:13] to the new and in once you belong to
[48:15] this world but you don't belong to this
[48:16] world you belong to the last room and
[48:19] then we need to recognize who we belong
[48:21] to doesn't matter what happens in life
[48:23] and where we go and walk on bars us and
[48:26] all these things if we know where we're
[48:27] from and if we know who we belong to and
[48:30] if there's something in us is I want to
[48:32] serve God you belong to the lab
[48:35] hallelujah amen so now we can say who is
[48:38] this great land because you know we
[48:41] don't know who Jesus was amen every
[48:45] church has its idea of who Jesus you can
[48:48] go no you go to every Church in your
[48:51] different organization in Wellington
[48:53] they have all different i did some say
[48:56] he's to some say he's three some say
[48:58] he's one son says he's a God of history
[49:01] some says he doesn't heal some says you
[49:03] know there's no millennium or rapture
[49:05] some say that you know run the
[49:07] millennium now some you're basically all
[49:09] kinds of thing something doesn't matter
[49:11] how you baptize some say you're going to
[49:13] be baptized by sprinkling Thomas is
[49:15] going to be baptized as a baby something
[49:17] at baptized amber Lord Jesus Christ
[49:18] which is true but they all have
[49:21] different ideas ever Jesus is the work
[49:24] in the beginning was the word the Word
[49:26] was with God and the Word was God the
[49:28] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[49:29] so Jesus is his words we had no
[49:32] here we had no idea who is this laughs I
[49:35] heard a story of him he died on on
[49:38] across two thousand years ago but who is
[49:40] he I mean it one has her own idea but we
[49:44] don't worship God on our ideas we
[49:47] worship focus he's revealed himself away
[49:49] that's how we worship God and then so
[49:52] finally find Lisa got sit in the same
[49:54] time I'm going to declare myself I'm
[49:56] going to make myself known the lamb is
[49:58] going to step 4 amen and this is what
[50:02] happened in the same time where programs
[50:03] here now if I be assumed of God and if I
[50:06] told the truth let him come forth now
[50:08] prove that it's true and I've never
[50:10] heard anyone else say those things I
[50:12] mean but you said now by said if I be a
[50:15] servant of God you can switch you to the
[50:17] message of OBS it in front of thousands
[50:19] of people it just lays the challenge now
[50:21] I've said the truth and I be a servant
[50:23] of God let him come let the lamb come
[50:26] and self and prove that is true and God
[50:29] comes down have been the Cates it over
[50:31] and over again is the lamb saying this
[50:34] is me speaking this is not this man
[50:36] speaking this is me speak to you I trust
[50:38] this is not too strong but this out
[50:40] as a lamb declaring himself and then we
[50:43] and then we hear those pillows tape and
[50:45] for me Jesus came out of history by
[50:47] hearing those tapes that's why please
[50:49] listen to the tape and it listen to us
[50:52] messages so don't get all my job but
[50:54] just listen to it amen listen hey if you
[50:57] that's just like if you don't eat you'll
[50:59] starve and die you will
[51:03] if you donít eight you're going to stop
[51:05] and daughter hundred percent of the time
[51:08] I mean as a clayey church virtually it's
[51:12] true
[51:14] if I go try need out of a garbage can
[51:18] pretty much hundred percent of the time
[51:20] I'm going to get soup
[51:23] physically it's true spiritually it's
[51:26] church I meant you are what you eat amen
[51:32] so now he hates declared himself in this
[51:36] this man who is the smarty Landon's
[51:39] before
[51:41] amen it is our husband I mean if the
[51:44] bride groom himself amen that a step
[51:48] forth now so was the masterpiece member
[51:52] it was our the reason he was bad and
[51:56] wounded on Calvary's because of us and
[51:59] it because we he had to be wounded for
[52:01] us otherwise we could not receive a life
[52:04] that was in him because the blood
[52:05] without the shedding of blood is no
[52:07] remission Ursa so now because we had a
[52:11] neat because we had a knee he said that
[52:15] Elijah the Prophet because we had a knee
[52:17] I mean he revealed himself in the same
[52:19] time because we had a knee he walks
[52:22] among us I mean every day because we
[52:25] have a neat he walks so it's because of
[52:27] our floors now amen our failings amen
[52:32] helps them that cause them to be the
[52:34] masterpiece down and cause them to be
[52:36] the masterpiece today amen
[52:42] you know you understand what I'm saying
[52:43] he's the master piece of God and in our
[52:47] brother bear I'm just going to read the
[52:48] CCS now this is the see if I can read it
[52:58] see now after men had fallen and
[53:01] deliberately opened the door to the
[53:03] enemy and coming and might him and sit
[53:05] death in him still God was not willing
[53:07] this be defeated he came down and
[53:10] started all over again he was going to
[53:12] make that man again he began to rebuild
[53:15] now he began to rebuild the man through
[53:18] the Old Testament but then that was
[53:21] because the original masterpiece a
[53:22] needed now was Anna money and the woman
[53:25] and it's oh god now when he rebuilt when
[53:29] he revealed the man through the Old
[53:30] Testament hit the refillable woman and
[53:33] inside through the church ages now God
[53:35] has been rebuilding the woman has been
[53:38] rebuilding eat he has been finishing out
[53:41] the second part of the masterpiece amen
[53:45] and then now you see he was wounded
[53:50] the wounds made him the masterpiece I've
[53:53] been thinking about this this wounds
[53:56] made in the masterpiece and his words
[53:58] forced us to receive eternal life cause
[54:01] us to receive healing cause us to
[54:04] receive delivery has worked and then now
[54:08] if the master at that part of the
[54:11] masterpiece was mired in order that life
[54:14] could come forth now that's the same
[54:17] thing happens to us but not that we
[54:20] would give we don't have to die for
[54:22] salvation now I'm not saying that at all
[54:24] but you understand we receive wounding
[54:27] and marek that people can receive what's
[54:32] in us
[54:33] yeah now how does that work i'll give
[54:37] you the example she had me done and when
[54:39] brother branham he turned down the call
[54:42] to God the evangelistic field because he
[54:44] doesn't do his mother-in-law and then it
[54:46] ends up now that is and his wife is
[54:49] dying in the dying in the hospital or
[54:52] dead and then their little Sharon Rosie
[54:54] little girl as in you're dying of
[54:57] meningitis and you know you know he said
[55:01] when we know he's he'd go and pray for
[55:03] them and says like a black sheet would
[55:05] come down gold with his wooden are
[55:06] through the Press says little share rose
[55:08] her eyes would would cost because the
[55:11] pain she isn't before she was dying now
[55:14] that was a wounding that was a Maori
[55:21] and God used that because Brandon allows
[55:24] up to get better he said the law jumpa
[55:26] the Lord taketh away blessed be the name
[55:28] of the Lord and then now when when when
[55:31] people would come in the prayer line
[55:32] before when God was present and he would
[55:35] pray the little kids and egg cross eyes
[55:37] not one of them left the platform with
[55:39] crossed eyes they all hundred these here
[55:42] came across and and eyes across and they
[55:44] came straight hundreds now and none of
[55:47] them knew what he had to endure for that
[55:50] to happen so now he was you understand
[55:55] one's own as my he was wounded he was
[55:58] mahi was scarred by these things and
[56:00] that was now used now that he could in
[56:03] turn to the person's burden he could
[56:05] enter into the person's name because you
[56:08] know when he you know it's just like
[56:10] when he was you know you're here when he
[56:12] know retails testimonies like the boy in
[56:15] Finland you know you know the two boys
[56:18] that got hurt in the car accident he is
[56:20] before he you know he had the vision of
[56:23] it happening and he told people
[56:24] throughout Canada United States write
[56:25] this on the Flyleaf for your Bible and
[56:27] and he relays the scene and then finally
[56:30] he's in Finland and the scenes being
[56:32] looked at in front of him and before he
[56:34] recognizes this is the boy this is the
[56:36] scene he says
[56:38] he says what if that was my little bully
[56:40] pool you know whenever whenever someone
[56:44] would come from your prayer your great
[56:46] need he wished think of his children or
[56:48] think of his family because he was
[56:50] entering into that person's need yeah
[56:55] and then we understand that the Lord
[56:56] said look again if you furthermore look
[57:00] at the particular model or the proxy is
[57:02] this not it and the crepe of the
[57:03] pointing came back to life amen but then
[57:06] all those things that happened to him
[57:08] it's because he is being wounded Jesus
[57:13] member the wounds made of the master be
[57:14] that the life of comfortable and it's
[57:18] now the same thing you say why do I have
[57:20] to go through why do I have to go
[57:22] through a certain thing and our great
[57:24] wounding and great scarring in great
[57:27] pain amen here brother Brennan when he
[57:31] tells the story of his wife first wife
[57:32] died and all these sick forgive me but
[57:36] maybe just telling in a different way
[57:37] but you know you hear him crying and
[57:39] he's getting deeply upset and hurt when
[57:41] he just recounts what happened to his
[57:43] wife and maybe because it was a wounding
[57:46] it was still a real real pain to him but
[57:50] God allowed those things to happen that
[57:51] now the life that was in him and it
[57:54] could be released to others because it'd
[57:57] be kind in terms of someone's need you
[57:59] can't really press them what they should
[58:00] be proud for a menu if you can't put
[58:04] yourself in their shoes and really look
[58:06] them up before God then you can't press
[58:08] them what they need to be grateful amen
[58:11] so now that's why you can go to your
[58:13] life so why did why did this happen to
[58:15] me and if God you because if you love to
[58:17] come along saying if God is really God
[58:20] why did he allow me to do this to you
[58:21] winds at asia's why did he allow this to
[58:24] happen you know and the whole reason
[58:27] these
[58:30] become a life into you amen God you that
[58:34] now his life you are going to be part of
[58:36] the identified masterpiece of God and
[58:39] God would use that user when you're
[58:41] struck when the great sculpture struck
[58:44] you allows you to be struck I should say
[58:46] I mean he allowed that to happen that
[58:48] when things come your way and people say
[58:52] / need praise me go over so you hear
[58:54] about this and you can really injure
[58:56] into their me and they may even know
[58:59] that you'll pray for them but you God
[59:00] lives that prayer and God will help that
[59:03] person
[59:07] what allowed you to be wounded that life
[59:13] because we are now that second we are
[59:15] the prime number all over the world down
[59:18] the true believers in God prior Jesus
[59:20] Christ as that as the restore t amen is
[59:25] the restored woman they make you go

[59:32] party with the cross mr. God reveal the
[59:34] physical union all these things whereas
[59:36] bixolon did they meant with a with a
[59:38] bride now coming for this a second part
[59:40] of their masterpiece Evan and brother
[59:43] Graham says now that Eve he says even
[59:45] was actually ordained to fall God you
[59:48] that it would happen it had caused it to
[59:50] happen but then but he allowed it to
[59:51] happen because he had to express is
[59:54] great redemption plan in that haven't
[59:56] looked out to heal out away that enemy
[59:59] could come and buy the whole thing so
[1:00:01] she was actually all danger for but then
[1:00:04] but then the Prophet tells us that this
[1:00:06] second if there's a day not to fall and
[1:00:09] then the sec the second Divas of things
[1:00:11] are standard test and then the second
[1:00:13] Divas of danger stand whatever the enemy
[1:00:15] can shoot at her Amen she'll stand the
[1:00:18] test hallelujah we're all day not to
[1:00:20] fall holy we're all dating to take a
[1:00:23] rapture friend he say will I fail every
[1:00:25] day that's why we have a lamb that's why
[1:00:27] we have luck I mean that's why we have
[1:00:29] an intercessor that's why we have a high
[1:00:31] priest then whatever the devil for us
[1:00:34] even if we do fall we say Lord forgive
[1:00:36] me and try me one more time Holloway
[1:00:38] that's why he stands it with his blood
[1:00:41] Alleluia we still have a lamb frequency
[1:00:43] level high priest they're still mercy
[1:00:45] amen well because where the blood is
[1:00:47] this mercy and is the blood hallelujah I
[1:00:51] mean that's why we have
[1:00:52] so you say I you know you can work is
[1:00:55] yourself and you can hate yourself
[1:00:58] remember you have a lamp and then you
[1:01:02] have a high priest that if you fall you
[1:01:03] can get back up again hallelujah so now
[1:01:09] that's why he is sure that's what he
[1:01:11] revealed himself with Hawaii has the
[1:01:13] same time he wants you to
[1:01:15] I am that man who is closest bandit that
[1:01:18] walks the waters of the field amen and
[1:01:21] now it's more than just now because the
[1:01:24] once upon a time it was now Eleazar I
[1:01:26] mean the server goober was a minister or
[1:01:29] the prophet or whoever was now
[1:01:30] introducing you Jesus Christ but then it
[1:01:33] goes now from from him introducing now
[1:01:36] in Isaak himself sets forth a me and he
[1:01:39] begins to show himself he because to
[1:01:41] declare himself our Lord Jesus and yet
[1:01:43] which is a secret had you know you've
[1:01:46] seen Rebecca's life once it was a
[1:01:48] secondhand story because our liaison was
[1:01:50] telling her about Isaac and then now
[1:01:52] finally she came amid Isaac and away
[1:01:55] from a second hey experience to a real
[1:01:57] experience a mint and that's why you
[1:02:00] just said you'd go just just listen to

[1:02:05] message and just enjoy it because
[1:02:08] remember we you know sometimes we forget

[1:02:20] we remember the shepherd is present in
[1:02:23] an hour Isaac is always you know our
[1:02:25] Lord Jesus is always present and then
[1:02:28] you know whatever path we need to go
[1:02:30] through he's present and he allows all
[1:02:33] those things happened does because he
[1:02:35] wants to express himself and then in all
[1:02:38] different ways as a comforter who's had
[1:02:41] to be comforted
[1:02:42] and he had to show you first he had to
[1:02:45] show you that you needed company and
[1:02:46] then he came and comforted you who's
[1:02:48] been sick he's a healer who's been lost
