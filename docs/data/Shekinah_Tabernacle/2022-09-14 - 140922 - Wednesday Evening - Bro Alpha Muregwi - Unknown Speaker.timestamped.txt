[1:11:00] hallelujah amen there's a quote that I
[1:11:03] wanted to read I don't know if I can
[1:11:04] read it
[1:11:07] hey it's from the Christ is the mystery
[1:11:09] of God the secret uh uh uh now God's
[1:11:13] secret secret mystery he had before the
[1:11:15] world began now back in the back of both
[1:11:17] mind there was something he was trying
[1:11:20] and he was going to achieve
[1:11:22] and he had a motive in doing it in order
[1:11:25] to let himself be expressed
[1:11:28] because first there wasn't even Moon
[1:11:32] Star atom molecule or anything he was
[1:11:35] God yeah but he exactly wasn't God at
[1:11:39] that time
[1:11:40] because God is an object of worship
[1:11:45] there wasn't nothing to worship Him amen
[1:11:48] hallelujah so
[1:11:50] uh
[1:11:52] sorry I think I cut I did cut this this
[1:11:55] this this this quote praise the Lord
[1:11:58] let's see if I picked it up well
[1:11:59] uh praise the Lord okay fine I wanted to
[1:12:02] go down with it you see it in the
[1:12:04] beginning God if you go into Christ The
[1:12:06] Mystery of God God had the attributes of
[1:12:09] being a father
[1:12:11] God wanted here the abuse of being a
[1:12:14] Healer but there was no one to show
[1:12:17] healing too yeah that's why he created
[1:12:20] you then you put you in that position
[1:12:22] for you to be sick so that you can show
[1:12:25] you that he is a Healer so when you are
[1:12:28] sick tonight say Lord hear my yeah you
[1:12:32] created me so that you can express your
[1:12:35] God so that you can express your
[1:12:37] attributes now here am I God wanted to
[1:12:41] show to you that he is a savior that's
[1:12:44] why he had to let you go into the world
[1:12:46] yeah then when you went into the world
[1:12:48] that's when he came to you to save you
[1:12:51] and so the same God you still got the
[1:12:54] same attributes
[1:12:58] oh beautiful
[1:13:00] I'll read my last question
[1:13:02] the rest we'll see later praise the Lord
