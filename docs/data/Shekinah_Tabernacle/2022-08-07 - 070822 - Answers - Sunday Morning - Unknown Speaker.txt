[Music] in jesus name [Applause] oh good morning everybody um just a quick background on on the reason that they're singing the song today um we've done a few um sunday school lessons on david and goliath and today i was going in a certain direction and so um over the past few weeks i've given them a memory verse and i i spot called on av for his memory verse and it was supposed to have been one samuel 1745 is actually the memory verse but he started reciting a verse that i was gonna actually the lesson was actually based on and so i asked him why and he said jonah gave him that verse which was the incorrect memory verse anyway but it was actually spot on on where i was going because i my verse today was on samuel 1 17 1 samuel 17 47 which says and all this assembly shall know that the lords save it not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands okay so i was um the lesson today was the battle is the lord's and also i wanted to show them where the testimony of where that song actually came from and why brother ryan hayes actually how the lord gave him that song um so this is this is the reason why they're singing the song today [Music] is [Music] we desire [Music] is [Music] he calls my [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] all your strength is gone and your heart feels [Music] is [Music] [Music] all your strength is gone

so we commit each one here to you we commit this um continue to commit the service to you and we just pray you bless us this morning as we continue to just worship and praise you lord in jesus name amen praise the lord um just while you're standing um and thank you musicians let's go to john 8 32. john 8 32 says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen amen you can take your seats this morning praise the lord how all feeling you're feeling good yeah yeah that's good you you um you all look very happy christians always look happy i think brother impo is one of the most happiest human beings that i've met as well i haven't seen him with i haven't seen him not with a smile and i think because his face is a bit darker his teeth just beam out [Laughter] you're cheating bro the rest of us got to work harder to make it look like we're smiling you know especially if we don't brush our teeth and they become yellow the same as our face praise the lord so um i was looking through brother ben asked me last night to bring a word and i was just thinking about different things that i could potentially speak about and there wasn't a lot a lot coming um look to even even look at some old material maybe thought i'd pull some of that out but um then then i thought uh maybe i'll you know you get these thoughts i thought maybe i'll read hebrews and i thought i'd redone hebrews let's go i was quite tired i said let's go hebrews 15. so and i think i see oh man there is no hebrews 15. so cool man i'm i'm in an awful place here [Laughter] and i thought to myself this is interesting i'm trying to find an answer what i was looking for was an answer and i thought that's an interesting thing to talk about trying to find an answer you know i needed an answer from the lord lord what shall i speak about and i needed an answer and my answer was i'll speak about needing an answer because who we as human beings we always need answers right yes that's that's that's how we we operate because we because we travel through time and we're always forced to make decisions we always need answers we're always we need answers each day don't we really about things that that's that's the way that we are spiritually speaking the bride we actually live in a time of answers that's right more answers than i think anyone has ever come across we have more answers than anybody else on this earth has ever had that's right we have now this is now by faith we have it we don't have it unless we claim it but by faith we have more answers because the opportunity to get more answers is laying before us and by the same token the world is in a a state of confusion confusion generally means either no answers or the wrong answers that's right that's confusion um and spiritually speaking we we know why that is this is the this is the age of the pale horse which is all three mixed together it's just confusion and and the time of babylon this is the tower of babel which was in babylon and this was where the confusion started because they were all in one accord they could speak the same language they were building this great tower and it was going to reach up to heaven i believe they called this area the gates of heaven brother brennan was saying but he god didn't like what they were doing so he he changed all the languages and then it became a place of confusion and this is this is i guess you call this the epicenter of confusion right there people were so confused what's going on and they couldn't now talk to each other it was just one big melting pot of confusion and that's what babylon is today it's confusion so so what the seed was here in genesis is what we're finding out now is in this place where babylon once again is has taken control through the catholic church and just through through the work of satan we've just got this place of confusion that's the just want to lay these few these few um foundations here but this doesn't surprise you you you watch some news you look around you and you can sense there's confusion going on there's there's people confused yeah there's a lot of confusion people not understanding much about the the true essence of life yes i want to read a quote from brother brandon he said this is brother branham and third person referring to himself that people were saying to him when he's in a prayer line he said brother branham i truly i truly realize that we're living in the last days i see the people in the spirit in the last days i see where they're having a form of godliness and ungodly people think they're right giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils i want to receive the holy ghost brother branham i've never been born again though i belong to a fundamental church or so forth but as far as being born again i haven't received it but now i want to accept christ right now and be filled with the holy ghost would you raise your hand god bless you right in the midst of all this devil's confusion and everything else hundreds of hands are going up to receive the baptism of the holy ghost right in the midst of confusion young men young women some of them sitting wiping their eyes with tears right in the midst of confusion yet there's nothing confused there's nothing confused about the presence of god amen and when god's power is moving into the hearts of the people so that's the place where we find no confusion as in the spirit of god and in his word there's no confusion and we i i want to speak a message to the lord from to you all this morning saying that the lord jesus wants to give you all the answers that you need that's my message to you this morning and i feel that's from the lord to each one of you it's a time where the lord jesus wants to give you the answers if you're confused about something the lord wants to give you the answers he wants to give you the answer and he knows the exact right answer he is going to give you the answers that's what his desire is for all of you that's his true heart towards every one of you so if you get nothing else out of the service remember i believe that's from the lord he wants you to have all the answers that you need sometimes we don't get all the we don't get the full answer but he gives us the answers that we need yes that's right when he was here on earth he would speak and he would explain scriptures like the parable of the sower and then people not a lot of people understood why he would say that why are you just talking about gardening you know i thought you're supposed to be preaching the gospel when we you know i'm a fisherman i don't really need to know about gardening because that's essentially what he talks about how to grow seeds and what happens when you grow seeds but then when he was with his disciples afterwards it says he expounded unto them what he was talking about here is actually the answer to what i was talking about here's a you're a bit confused i'll give you these this word and you won't be confused anymore and you are all disciples of the lord you're all walking with him you're in union with him so he wants to give you the answers to anything you're confused about he can pull you aside and he'll say here's the answers all of you i don't want to dwell on this too long this sort of stuff because i don't need to point out that we live in a confused world but just to confirm that we do i could have got a i could have got 10 sermons on the confusion that's out there but we don't want to look on the negative fake we want to look on the real thing and then we can just easily identify the fake you know that's how they teach people to identify fake things as they teach them what the real thing looks like and then they spot a fake you don't tell them all about the fake stuff this is the fact that this is the fact that this is the fact that because i don't really know what the real thing looks like you know some ministries like that they're pointing at everything else everyone's doing wrong they but they don't have the real thing to actually give a lot of the a lot of the people that are anti this message that's all they've got and they do it with us with everyone they just point out all the wrongs but they have nothing to they have no right to bring people to okay you say so what what is right then where do i go uh we're not sure about that we just want to tell you where not to go yes well that's what i thought you just want to try and tell us what all the fakes are but you're not sure it's a fake because you haven't seen the real thing you know so we want to look upon the real word of god and then identify what what doesn't make sense does this make sense to you there are no wrong right or wrong answers there is only intuition now this is very confusing because this is now non-christian you know just ideas that just sort of float in and someone grabs hold of it and oh yes i think i think that but this is i would call this a silly thought oh my goodness only intuition so what if i say to tom you know now we can say this because he's public he's a public figure and he's spoken it so it's it's it's when something's in the public arena they expect you can talk about them but if it wasn't i wouldn't say okay tom let's try this little experiment let's maybe put you in a little room and let's put a let's put some bombs in there right in this room and let's run a wire back to another room and let's put a bunch of three or four year olds in there and and there's a button there saying blow up tomorrow don't blow up tom and now you sit in there let's get these little children use your intuition how do you feel about those children maybe girls might go oh no don't block tom and there'd be a smelly guy you blow up tom you know because his intuition told him but you see so tom there's more than intuition there's right or wrong we shouldn't blow you up so we got to teach people don't blow up tom you know there has to be right or wrong otherwise we can't function i i laugh at this but this is very demonic this is this the stuff that's happening is you know sometimes with the stuff you either laugh or cry you think man i i'm going to get very angry i just can laugh it off but i'm not laughing like i'm not making life of it like i think it's not important this was a hearing about the new i guess in the states that the they sort of changed how abortion was done and they said that each state can now decide it not not it just went from a national level to a state level there's a lot of uproar about it because people in certain states if they didn't want it then they would decide what they wanted to do in their state but if you wanted it you could just go to another state so um but this this one here was this this lady is a professor at berkeley and the other guys as a senator and she started referring to people with the capacity for pregnancy and he said to her um excuse me do you mean woman and she said i i find your comments very transphobic yes i just want to say that right and he said and she said um she said do you believe men can have babies and he said uh no and he she said that shows you're transphobic now how do you get to that position is you think okay a person that's a woman if they say they're a man they're now a man but then they have the capacity to have a baby so so a man can have a baby so so that's her that's her logic behind this argument right so now he's transphobic because he's saying you're not accepting that comment is not accepting trans people so you're you're doing violence towards them he's like so we can't even have this conversation without you you accuse me of all these things and saying woman can't have babies but you see why engage in this nonsense because it's confusion it's just now but it's demonic the the the answers that she came to were not answers from the lord that the lord gave her they were answers from a demon yes from the pit of hell is where the answer came from that she grabbed onto and agreed to yes that's right see now when we talk about answers we want godly answers we want god's answers lord what's your answer because i don't want these i don't want to listen to these demonic answers and these answers are all around us these demonic answers some of them we pick easily some of them are a bit more subtle but that's why the lord says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now you all know my uh concept on freedom is you can't just say i'm free because freedom has to be related to something it has to be free from something it's got to be relative i can't say i'm free because people like to say well i'm free in christ that means i can do anything i want it's not it's not the correct concept of freedom free when the lord says you'll know the truth and the truth shall make you free it's essentially you'll be free from the wrong answers from the wrong stuff and the consequences of the wrong answers that's what you'll be free from if i don't set you free and tell you the right way you'll be you'll go down the way of sin you won't accept salvation then you'll pay the price for that and that will be the road so that's the that's where i'm going to set you free from that road it doesn't mean when you come to christ you do whatever you want because paul said paul a prisoner of jesus christ see he was because he decided that paul decided i want your answers not those answers so if your answers say this then i'm constrained i'm bound by your answer so so it's it's when we say freedom it means more i'm free in christ it means i'm free from all that stuff like i'm free from the trickery i'm free from the devils and all these demons the ideas and their ways to try and drag me that way because we must understand on this basis that every that the lord's answers for us only have our intention i only have our good intention in mind all of his answers are only good for us none of his answers there's no trickery in it that that the end result of one of his answers is negative for us it's all good even if we don't understand it it's always good but behind every every answer of satan is trickery that's right like a salesperson that's trying to sell you rubbish and he knows it's rubbish but he's trying to trick you to buy it but he knows it's rubbish satan knows overall his product he's trying to sell you it's rubbish he knows it he he knows he's giving you a real deal he just tries to trick you and all his demons are there to try and trick us so the lord says i want to make you free from that and be and be alive to christ okay and now this this is very simple but there's actually two types of answers because there's a lot of answers given you google something you get a lot of answers but there are two types of answers what are they right answering the wrong answer like if i tell if i ask you can a man have a baby what do you say that's the right answer see you're you're a lot smarter bro than a berkeley professor a very intelligent boy this whoa no we did it by the word of god because the word of god is correct his answer is right we don't need to worry about it it's just right okay there are right answers there are wrong answers and i briefly touched on this at the beginning but we need answers because we're moving like we need answers every day what we should do yeah like i want to boil it right now make it real simple we could wake up in the morning i have to decide whether we want to live or not i have to make a decision do i really want to live this day you know and some people the devil says no you don't want to live this day that's demonic i believe there's a spirit inside of us even the spirit of life that's in us that our human spirit wants to live our natural human spirit like a plant a plant when it grows it naturally wants to live let me live man you put an environment where it can't strive it will start to die but it's not because the plant says i give up it's just because it's in an environment where the life can't become all that it could be it maybe you put it don't give it water or you don't treat that life right but the life as soon as you change the environment on that plant if you put in a different environment where where the life can now live the life will just live and i believe like like paul said in the bible and it almost doesn't stand true today though it is true he said no man hated his own flesh and yet people cut their own flesh and they do things to it they hate it but i believe he's talking about no man like no he's not demons hate our flesh these people get demons on them and it's a demon that hates their flesh that's right but that man or that woman doesn't hate their flesh it's not them it's just these demons they you know so we we have to every day we need answers do i live and if i'm going to live what am i going to do now where do i go because we're traveling through time we can't just sit we're answering questions all the time you know every day you're you're making decisions all day every day some are small some are big like i always say there are small days there are big days some days it just sort of hat the day just happens with relative normality other days a big thing happens wow i lost my job or this happens and it's a big day or there's a big opportunity came or something happens okay and also on top of that there are a lot of answers that are given to us in this generation all the time you feed answers this is the answer this is the answer this is the answer and it actually if you don't watch it it can actually affect psychologically affect your mind if you listen to the wrong answer too much that's why it affects you the the things you watch even news that if you watch a certain slide of news there are always opinions that are put out that can affect psychologically your your take on what would be a godly answer like if you watch too much of these debates about that stuff i was talking about the trans stuff you would you would start to reason with some of the not not the radical parts of it but some of the less radical stuff you're like oh they do have a bit of a point there this maybe maybe people are yeah people are maybe more feminine does that sort of you know if you if if you let that influence you too much this is why the lord said that we should spend time with believers because believers that are filled with the holy ghost that tell you god's answers all the time they're speaking to you and they're saying to you the truth and that's that's fellowship if that's why the bible says what fellowship has light with darkness how can they fellowship together brother brown said if you get a bad woman and a good man or a good man and a bad woman they will eventually go either this way or that way together yes that there will be a tussle and whichever whichever one has the most force that could make it happen they will influence one that's why it affects what friends you have we should have godly friends that will always give us godly answers that's why there's a that's the reason why there's a unity in our fellowship is because we all follow the same answer therefore when we fellowship is there's a there's a kindred spirit and there's a kindred answer there's kindred fellowship there's not confusion because we're listening to the same answer so we can fellowship yes how can two walk together unless they'll be agreed well we can we can sit and agree amen this is sometimes what our what we get to in life we get to these junctions in life no doubt you have been you have come up against a lot of these junctions in your life and you say which way do i go this could be in the natural path you're going to take it could be as simple as you could be driving on a road naturally which way do i go which way is is um whanganui is it left straight ahead or right or which way is their house you know or it could come down into a natural sense do i take this job do i take that job do i take that job or do i in this situation do i steal it do i not steal it do i tell someone about it you know you've got these options you all come up to this point and but this is now just a normal piece of robe where you're traveling along this is actually where satan tries to get all his mess with us is when we're just traveling along here as well because he wants to throw on the wrong answer so that when we get to this point we go the wrong way so as we're traveling along he's he's always i'm going to get to you personally soon but i just want to lay these things out about let me explain it in this term as you're traveling along the road you don't have to make a decision this now this is this is just an example i've used to just cement this fact that i'm trying to talk about if you're traveling along the road and you want an answer about what you should do with your like whether you should in today's terms sleep around or not you look in the word of god and the answer says no so you're traveling along this road and you you should be studious like like david said thy word have a hidden mind heart that i might not sin against you you should be studious before you have to make a choice you should know what choice you need to make there are a lot of things you could actually learn now so when you come to the crossroad you know okay this is the way very simple i've learned this i'll go that way that's what david meant by that he said if i if i read your word if i know what it says i fellowship with brethren i get the right answer when i come up to that point when i come up to the option of doing this i know how to not sin against you this is easy it's that way your word says do this the opportunity may come up and you say no i will go this way okay and then and then you decide then then then when then you may the lord may you may be married and then on that same path you think well now the answer is when it comes up to committing adultery you know the answer no i don't do that i don't go down that road i go this way that's very simple but i want to point to you as a because people get this answer wrong and the reason why we've got so much confusion is so much mess and families in this life is because simple answers like this are not followed so different roads are taken and we've got a mess we've got families we've got there there is mess amongst the world because there's a simple answer that wasn't followed the lord gave an answer this is the answer amen okay hallelujah so when you're married you do not you do not be unfaithful you you this is what you do that's the answer now i want to point out the real answer no the real answer is actually receiving the lord and receiving salvation is realised are these here you could do all this and not receive the lord and you still won't win the game of life so these are this is just an example as you travel along the road and then but then picking someone that you want to marry the lord says be careful when you do get married don't marry someone that doesn't believe like you because you'll have this sort of trouble will they go your way they might but they may not now we don't know what that may be we may try and think well maybe they will but we don't know that for a fact so the lord says just be careful go with someone that believes the same as you see be not unequally yoked with an unbeliever it because you may come up to a to a position in the road where you've got the option oh do i go this way where i just carry on with nobody or do i go that way where i go with an unbeliever that may be you you're you're you're a point in the road that you you need to take or you need to make a choice i'm just i'm not saying this about anything i just this is just an example that we can now when you are with them it says don't leave them the lord says when you so when you come up to the opportunity where you think i may leave this person you think no i'm not going to leave this person so it's the answer the answer no i'm not going to leave i'm going to stick this one out for better for worse that's what i said i'll do and that's the answer so if we follow the answers i can assure you when you if you follow the answers every time you come up to this crossroad if you follow the answer the lord said you won't run into trouble amen okay that you you got to that that's that's the way but now let let's say let's say this one let's say the theory here is another answer just try before you buy you just sleep around that's that's that's an answer that's given and that answer is is accepted by i would say 95 percent of population just accept it or more just accept that answer yeah it's all right if it doesn't work just get someone else there's another answer if you get to the crossroad you get to a crossroads just try before you buy you get to the crossroad where you want to leave it's not working out over you i'll go to someone else that's the answer and that's the road you'll go down uh even abortion if you don't want the baby just abort it that's an answer you see that that becomes an answer to a road to follow and or maybe they don't abort them but they have this children and then after a while they get to the crossroad where i'm sick of this i want someone else and they and that family gets split up broken up and then they go with someone else it's very common today but the result is following the wrong answers see that that's what that's what it all comes down to and the this is real simple stuff if you look at these answers look at the results they've gotten but people won't accept the right answer because why it's demonic because there are demons that are pushing these there's a force of demons that are always saying this to people that's right and no doubt you if you've got non-christian friends this is what they are going to think this is natural this is the way that the natural world thinks they they think they think just like this but we don't think like this okay that was just an example to to show you answers matter answers matter a lot there was a there was a gathering about like this and they were talking about it was a non-christian event and they were talking about um uh how to like stds and sexually transmitted diseases and how you can avoid some of that and this and that just but a very carnal a non-christian way that says it's okay just all the stuff to avoid it and and halfway through they said oh we're going to break now for a a cup of um a cup of coffee and biscuits and stuff before that this lady had said to the crowd she said what about abstination what about just not doing it they said oh no that's not it's not an option that wasn't an answer oh no we can't have that answer we've got to have these other answers we only want we only want these answers but we want to figure out how to make these answers work they don't work right but she said what about just not doing it no no no that's not an answer and this gathering so then they had a break and they all had coffee and mingled mixed and mingled together and and she she just felt like i don't want to go and have a coffee and a biscuit i just want to go over here and i'll just stay over here and i won't have a have a coffee she didn't know why that she was a christian she just felt like i'll just go and do that and the lady that was running the show kept on saying come and have some come and have some um coffee and biscuits she said no no it's fine i'm i don't feel like eating and i'm no i'm good thanks i'll just i'll wait till the session starts again then we'll come in again now this lady in all her wisdom she thought that the the lady that running the show she got everyone together she said right now i'll show you how this works you see now we all stopped for a coffee now who talks with who you see where i'm going oh you talked with him oh then you talk with them you talk with them they show that everyone makes a mingle so that these sexy transmitted diseases can all go through everyone and all see this this is if there was no protection it's all just going to spread through you and then this lady put her head up and said hang on i abstained from mixing and mingling so i've got nothing [Laughter] see it's like christian god's answers always work it always makes sense it's like this is simple stuff yes the liam understands this alien easy yeah see the lord's people are intelligent amen amen now i want to i want to just quickly i want to bring this to like a sort of a global more of an overview but i really want to talk about us personally here is a question that somebody asked in in the jerusalem just after their pentecost now when they had heard this they were pricked to their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do there's a question because peter has said to them you're lost you've done this you've crucified the messiah you're in an awful place so they had a problem and they said what's the answer tell us the answer and peter gave them an answer that still stands today he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he gave an answer they said we've got a big problem what's the solution what's the answer here's the solution now anyone that will follow that solution will come out all right you'll get the answer you'll get what peter said because he said now the for the promise or the answer is to you to your children then if as many as the lord our god shall call meaning this answer is going to stand forever this is the answer if you want salvation this is it amen okay so that's the answer real simple you want you want the answer what shall we do here it is here there's the answer what we had over time was the answer changed what must we do men and brethren what shall we do be baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost then put your name on the church registration book and join the programs then you'll be all right everything will be okay just just come along and that doesn't matter this doesn't matter that other thing doesn't matter just put your name in the book and yep come along at least you know in the catholic church it's come along at least easter and christmas then then you'll be all right you know just if you miss christmas oh man your soul's hanging in the balance because you miss the christmas you know poor catholic these poor guys i think man that would be awful i don't really like going to church on christmas day if it falls on a sunday i'm like man come on it's like it's like my holiday man it's like the poor the family's here and like just like becca but i don't feel bad i'm like hey man i'm at church every other day sunday of the year there wednesdays you know it's like a different everyone's on holiday it's just different now i can almost justify that right people were like whoa but i feel sorry for these catholics they never go to church all year then the one time and all the family visits they've got to go to church it's like you poor guy man just goes throughout the year make it easy on yourself i shouldn't laugh about it but this is this is the answer that was given over time this answer was given and it didn't produce any results because the other answer produces the holy ghost which changes lives and it puts us into fellowship with the lord and then he the holy ghost begins to teach us all things we we we hear his word for our day that we grow and cry somewhere it's like we're a tree planted outside the sun's hitting us everything's going well we're thriving these are the trees that accept that answer the reason why we have to get is this plastic they have to get plastic in here because they can't live you know they're not designed to survive under this environment this answer the answer is outside under the sun of god with the light of god's word shining upon them and then they live the answer's not in here this this environment here is not where where these plants are supposed to be but the lord saw that the reason why we got sent to profit was because this was the main answer being given and there was confusion and it wasn't producing any results that's right you see like like the worst result you can have the the number one answer that we need is is the first thing we need to answer is is there a god the first thing we have to say is yes he that comes to god must believe that he is so that's the first answer we must say uh yes there is a god because when you acknowledge that it opens the channels up to start to have a conversation okay if there's a god who are you if i've got a creator who are you because that puts me in a in a position where i'm sort of below something what am i below who are you and is there anything that i have to do which is essentially what those men ask men in brisbane what must we do now they were i think some of them may have believed there was a god some of them maybe didn't because there was a multitude of men around even though they were jerusalem they were from different parts of the world but i think the ones that asset had this they sort of knew there's something more than just us that's where you've got to start that's why sometimes other cultures outside of the west have more of a chance for the gospel to reach them because they already have an understanding there is more to life than this stuff here they're natural things so when you when the gospel is preached they can they can see well yes i know there's something else what's your version of what it is and if there's power within that they're like well this version of what they say is who this god is because they may have had other gods the sun god this god the tree god this idol of stone but when they hear about this god and then the presence of god comes and maybe healings happen they say okay the god that you're talking about there's something real to this uh my friend couldn't walk now he can walk yeah that's right who is this god you know that and that's the and when we when we receive that answer then we say well what must we do and we receive this answer that's the way we go but the lord god looked down and saw that the world was full of confusion because of this sort of answer was given now this is all from satan yeah man didn't conjure the sun these these the people that came up with these answers they didn't think of them of themselves we actually don't come up with answers believe it or not we are like sheep sheep don't know what they're doing they just get led we get lead every thought that we have was given to us by somebody somebody now eventu now if i follow this idea then i i got an answer from satan say well no satan didn't talk to me yeah well he somewhere along the line he talked to somebody they talked to somebody they talk to somebody they talk to somebody and then they talk to you where is the origin of that answer it's in hell that's where it comes from or paul's answer where was the origin of that answer it was from so the son of god okay this is why jesus said elias shall truly come first and restore all things now we live and that's why i say globally generally we live in a time if we receive this message of this hour we live in live in a time of answers we can have answers to all of this so we don't need to walk around confused that's why we live in an eagle age the anointing is eagle so which could fly up look around and not be confused eagles can see a long way and they can they can perceive that's why i say on a spiritual level as a global body of christ we live in a time of great answers hallelujah amen that's the age that we live in and the lord jesus wants to give you all the answers that you want he wants to answer all your questions that's what he does how does this affect you how does this affect you the first way that it affects you is as a general bride of christ we know how to live our general life with the general answers meaning there are answers that brother andy is going to get that i'm going to get it's just like we're going to get the same answer on general things like like um this this up here this is a general answer relative to andy relative to me relative to megan relative to everyone the this is you know the the word of god has general answers that if we in general have to we all just accept if we come into the light of god's word and you understand that's there's general answers and that that actually is what gives us unity amongst the believers is that we are following the same general answer so we can have unity the problem we've got in these countries and in western countries now as you can see there's disunity when a country serves god and there's a general idea that we are going to serve this power and we are going to do these certain things then even in a country there's unity that's why the bible says it's a precious thing it's actually a blessing of god when there's unity yes because when there's unity things can work together what you're seeing now is disunity in countries because there are people that now learn no longer want that answer i refuse that answer and this it's growing so there's a growing division because there are more and more people that want a different answer than what the country was established on we want a different answer that's why you're in this country let's take away the national anthem we don't want that answer let's take away the the prayer at the in parliament we don't want that answer see there's a and it creates it's all right it's all right be happy about it i often say i read the news just to make sure everything's going down like it should be you know it's all falling apart like it should be have a quick read yep she's all falling apart it's right on track don't try and fight against it you're going to lose that's true there's no point fighting against this because this is the curse of of of shutting out light you get darkness that's right we always say that darkness is just the abscess of light if you don't want light you get darkness welcome to a world of darkness folks and it's only going to get darker and more confused so don't try and christians now trying to fight against that they're wasting their time exactly they're not going to win i believe it's going to be twisted around so that it's going to come from the pressure will come from christians not non-christians and you'll see you'll see what i mean like people think the mark of the beast is going to be this evil thing christians won't accept that that's what they're fighting as for you watch if they win this realm which i think they currently will win this big movement that's happening globally there's a massive movement they will probably win and they will probably implement it themselves to keep that away yeah and it will be from them but they will accept it because it's from us that's how cunning just watch it just watch it i think it's going to work that way so that's general right we have unity amongst us when people follow the same thing there's unity that's why if you if you go with a marry a believer you're going to generally your conversations within this x amount of space are going to be in unity because you you you may differ very on these things those things just as people are but you're going to be gen and so you can walk together but if you go with people that don't believe like you then you're going to have more disunity okay and even in churches man there's i mean i used to be involved in a lot of them and it's it's very confusing because one person comes up one week and speaks one thing and then the next one comes and speaks another thing and then the next one gives a message about this and a prophecy about this and it's all just confusing because no one's they're all given different answers so they're all just trying to push their own answer yeah brother branham said even he said in the bigger cities he said there's more confusion when i go around to the bigger cities there's a lot more confusion they said like miami and california when i go there the people are more confused he said because people there's a lot of people coming and going from those cities someone comes in with the wrong answer and he said because it's such a big place on the balance of probabilities there are some people that agree with that answer so they gather together and they start causing trouble to think we don't want to be a part of you anymore we've got this answer and the ability for it all to get confusing and and fractured is greater in bigger cities you see that's why when i go there there's just there's confusion he said i go to miami it's confusion when i turn up there right because they're not getting they're actually not getting the same general answer okay so if you want to know why we've got unity here like i believe each one and here you all appreciate brother ben is your pastor amen right now because of that you can you can sense the unity because of that the blessing of god in the presence of god is upon that to bless it but if i said oh who likes brother ben is that pastor this guy said yes and said no no someone else they wrote this one and that one and get this one no no pastor we should have this that then it wouldn't have the same atmosphere that we've got right but because because we follow the word of god and we see it and we feel the pull of the lord and then we see okay we can identify how we should treat men of god and we've identified this then we've come in to and we're reading from the same answer we have unity okay but now we come to this interesting part is that some answers are not as easy to come by as others like if you ask me a question should i maybe be with someone before i got married i'd be like no that's an easy that's an easy question no it's not it's straightforward right yes and you could say the same answer to everyone else and it would stand true liam could say the same answer to his friends it would always stand true because it's a general answer but but we have we we have our personal questions in our own life that are only relevant to us the answer to me may not be the same as you right and the issue with this is we have got invested interest in the answer like it matters if i don't get the answer man it may not matter to you because you're not the one that has to decide whether you take this job or not but it matters to me you say i'll just pray about it i've always thought what's easy if you say that man you i've got to make a decision in the morning i came to you for some advice man i just don't pray you're like what do you think like because your day will go on and you don't have to you don't worry you're just like come on man enter into my burden man what do i do man just pray now i know that's the answer but sometimes we you know yeah i'd say look if it was me you know but there are decisions we have to make we'll touch on some of those number i've got about three different types of questions that we are going to be asking some questions we ask that the answer doesn't really matter and it's it's got no invested interest we just we just wonder about something right like you know there are questions like that we can sort of put these questions in different categories so you would have these questions that if you asked brother andy for the answer he couldn't tell you it wouldn't really bother you and then you don't have to act on the answer anyway so it's like oh well just to stay not knowing maybe one day i'll find out i'll give you some examples in a little bit or then there are other questions of why something is like it is in your life well why is this like this i know you've all got those questions why is something like this in my life what is it these are the sort of answers that the lord wants to tell you he wants the lord knows the answers to all these questions and these are the answers we're in a time where even those questions well why is something like it is in my life why is it he actually wants us to know the answers um hey there were a lot more just let me oh here sorry oh yeah okay i'll just go through i just want to go through this now there are different ways you can get answers and then i want to make it personal and bring some uh questions that you might have and i think some of them will be relative to you but the first answer is actually to pray about something right we say but that's sometimes just an easy yeah just pray about it but that actually means it doesn't mean okay if i i'm not praying now then when i go kneel down on that chair and i i say start my watch i'm praying then and then when i get up i'm not praying anymore you know like a certain time pray actually is more than that it's like get in a place where you can commune with the lord yes so you can hear an answer and get in a place where it doesn't matter which way the answer goes genuinely get in that place like whether you lord because if if we have a force of our human spirit to want to go a certain way that will override the spirit of god because the spirit of god doesn't push in so if our spirit really wants something all the praying in the world aren't going to help us because we're going to probably go that way anyway you see but we should still praying about it means we have the ability to get into a relationship with the lord the lord paid the price of our sin took it away so that we could enter into the holiest of holies and be in a place where there are all the answers that's what this is about you can enter in a place that has all the answers all the answers right uh you say then the next question you you the way you can actually look at if you should do something or not is does it all line up is it as is what i'm doing actually and then there's let's say if you want to do some physical some particular thing first you can line it up like um you know when you go on boats and i don't know if you've been on a boat and if you have to go through a channel and get back to the shore when you're out you don't know where the channel is because it's underwater but they put markers on the land and one down on the beach and that so as you drive your boat you can you line up these three markers and then you know if i go straight that direction i'll be in the channel they all line up like that and this was brother perry green's one that he always used he said he wants these three things to line up but is what i'm doing scriptural is it a scriptural thing yeah is it okay by the word of god the word of god condones it yes okay now secondly does my spirit have a witness do i feel in my spirit because that's an answer how do i feel about this or we don't go on feelings we actually do we do because we can sense the spirit of god you know when you're doing wrong someone said last week how do you know when you're doing wrong and the answer was because your conscience tells you what about when your conscience doesn't tell you and you feel like no this is okay you should be able to rely on how you you feel about something you should have a confidence towards the lord that if the same if you're spirits to me and i'm in harmony with your spirit then i can feel whether it's the right thing because you don't know why but you just feel like i just don't want to do it i don't know why other times you may think well i just want to do it i don't know why like i think i can share a little testimony maybe sister genie won't mind like this was one of those situations where we were sort of looking at a admin person and jenny's doing the church accounts and i thought she might maybe get her to do admin for other businesses but we don't really know what we're doing yet it's there's not really a job there as such it's just like there isn't there isn't it's kind of like we weren't looking for someone but but something about the situation where i i i kind of thought there was something this is just my answer i thought it just felt like i just think that i should for some reason i don't know why it just it it was a step of faith but it wasn't it was kind of like well but it but the answer wasn't oh should we work it out and see if we've got enough this and that and do it all naturally it was more the answer was more like well i just feel something about this i just feel to do it i don't know why i just do let's just let's just do it and i don't know but i didn't know her situation i've kind of found it i just found this interesting where she i think you must have been praying about it maybe because i think tamar um sister jenny has to work at nights in the hospital and tamar her daughter was the babysitter when she would go to work but now tamar left for when did she go to greece friday friday right but and i think we spoke to jenny on wednesday or something tuesday they said you know we just feel yeah you've got a job start monday and it's a work from home job because she didn't want to work at the hospital anymore but then tamar is going anyway so she can't go to from monday she couldn't go to work at the hospital anyway because she doesn't have a babysitter but i didn't know that stuff we just said yep no you can have a job and for some weird reason start monday just do it you know but it was i look at that that makes me feel good because you know when you do things when you follow the lord the lord always has a stamp on a situation like if you looked at someone that made something fantastic you'd think wow that's very well made there's a it's going to have an impact on you if something's not made very good you'll just brush it off it but when the lord does things he does it very good and you can see the hand like in that situation you can see i can see the hand of god here and then it gives you a confidence like brother i think jimmy i was sitting in my in my lounge this guy's not going to like me after this i was sitting in my lounge and there were a lot of things that i had to be doing but i was i was at the at one of our businesses too much and i was like i just can't be there anymore i need to do these other things that the time is ticking and i can't i need to allocate time to these other things so i sat in the lounge and i thought lord i need somebody to work in the factory just speak it out that's what you don't it's not demanding to the lord it's there's something in your spirit that feels like i feel like i should say this it's not like i'm just going to say this and demand it we shouldn't just say things like that without feeling like it's what we should we shouldn't do that's what i'm saying about you know the answer be confident you know the answer you can like i wouldn't just say something like that without feeling like no this is what i'm supposed to be doing because our words are powerful they speak and then it happens so be careful what we speak because i but something in me said okay i'm going to speak that because it's what has to happen because the lord has given me answers about the direction i'm supposed to go on and this is not it fully so i need to go this way so we need that answer i think it was and then someone maybe a few two weeks later or something someone randomly said oh they after the camp they were thinking of moving here it's like oh really it's interesting i'll just text him which i don't usually brother andy texts while you're still talking about or something he'll be texting the person two in the morning me i'm like i take it a bit slower you know just let's have think about this i i unusually just text them i thought i'm going to text them hey why don't you come here for a job boom just not thinking anything of it just fired it away i actually told you okay there andy told me he said i got a feeling in me two weeks earlier oh yeah so he was listening to the right station i was maybe not i wasn't tuned in as much he did it actually you're right right um but the uh the at the same time jimmy said lord if you want me to go there give me a house and give me a job so when we text you you've got a job here oh there's that was an answer there's one of them answers and i think you got a house like but that's what i mean about when something is of the lord you can see his hand upon it it's got nice handiwork it doesn't just it's not all hard and man there was such a lot of trouble to do that you know to get him down here and we had to negotiate and then we had to offer him way more than what we were going to and then he had all these terms and then we couldn't find him a house he had to stay at the back of the factory and they're just all you know the lord i mean sometimes you've got to push through things but the lord actually his answers always have a nice stamp on it that brings me to this other one if you want an answer you can put what they call put a fleece out now this this this comes from what gideon did the lord told gideon i'm going to deliver through you and he broke down his father's idols and that and then but he was a little bit unsure he said lord are you going to deliver by my hand or not he was still a bit unsure fleeces generally only work when you already have a feeling to do something like jimmy had a feeling already to move down to wellington so he says i just failed to go there but lord what he did was and we would call him in scriptural terms he put a fleece out lord if you want me to go make this happen now i suggest with your fleeces you don't speak it out you put it in here because satan will he if he's trying to trick you he'll hear what you say oh he wants that's his police all right make it happen if he knows you shouldn't do it or whatever you know like you keep those in your mind don't go and tell the church i'll put this fleece out you know even things that you're thinking of doing for the lord like brother brown said i wouldn't speak it out because satan will know my plans and then try and get ahead of me and mess them up you know but there is this term so gideon said i'll put this fleece out and if it's in the morning if the if the ground outside is dry and the fleece is wet then i know it's from you it may have been neither around but then the next night it happened the ground was dry the fleece was wet and he said oh lord forgive me but i just want one more confirmation tonight i'll put it out and then make the fleece be dry and the ground be wet and it was like how he said it so he got the two opposites he took that as confirmation where what you said to me is correct and i should go with it so that's another way we can find out if you know what an answer we can put a fleece out we can still do that that's why we call that's what jimmy did to put a fleece out if i get a job and then then the lord moves on my heart and we go hey here's the job and he create not only that he creates a situation so there is a job needed and that just all works yes right amen another one you can do if you're you can actually ask advice now you can go if you're younger even older you can go to your parents you go to your past you can go to your friends you do have to be careful who you go to and what because like if your parents are not believers and and you say oh look there's a job that in this particular town that's paying me twice as much as what i'm being paid now they'll stop you right there take it take it son good because they're only concerned about your financial well-being take it but if you came to me and said there's a job there i'll say what area oh is it is there a church around there no no not really a church are you planning on doing anything there not really i wouldn't take it if it was me i wouldn't take it no way that so that would be my advice so you've got to be careful what advice you get like friends if you've got friends that are believers they will no doubt probably give you friendly godly advice if they're believers they will tell you but if they're non-believers you go to them for advice they will probably not tell you the right advice so you must be a pastor a godly pastor always will give you good advice i believe you know they will because even godly parents parents kind of do just look at their their natural well-being and maybe a little they try and balance it all up you know but sometimes you just have to look at someone's spiritual well-being over their natural well-being and say this is maybe you want you to do here yeah but you see so different people will give you and then your friends will give you like an emotional well-being are you are you happy doing that you're not happy you know it's all about how you feel because they came for me more for you and that so whenever i ask advice i always take into account who am i asking and what answer are they likely going to give me that's right because you can just want to go and do something and ask advice from all the people that you know are going to tell you to do it then you're like they asked about five different people they all said yes but you knew and yourself that they were just going to give you this advice a certain way okay right but those are just i just gave you ways that you can get answers but i believe that the greatest way is having a where we can have a relationship now with the lord where through these different means we can know the answers we don't have to walk around confused like i said to shannon spen the other day just driving i said it's been such an enjoyable time here for the last 10 years because i haven't been confused i've known everything that's going to happen i said 10 years ago this is the way that it's all going to pan out this is what's going to happen and it's all panned out that way there hasn't been any oh wow i didn't think this was going to happen this way it's just happened because the lord said you're going to go there and this is going to happen that way even when we moved here we felt to move here and then we went around to a believer's house for like a bit of a dinner and this and we just told them oh we we're gonna move to wellington and that that one of the sisters there said well that's that's incredible i had a dream and i woke up in the morning i told my husband the least are going to move to wellington that's what she got told and was that correct yeah in her dream delays are going to move to wellington you get that you think okay well we're on the right track here she didn't we didn't mention anything about moving or nothing she just had this dream and then she told us us and then we were going to move so you think well i must be i'm on the right track then the lord sort of gives you little bits of confirmation then actually when we when we moved up to where we were i could suppose like i said i had to fight a pretty hard fight to get there none of my family wanted to go home and they're like no way they fought me i was i was the last man standing i just felt in my heart that was supposed to do this usually when shannon disagrees with me i kind of go oh there's a bit of a red flag okay um i won't do this i i i'm wiser now i know i've learned if she doesn't want to go along with it i generally question it i'm like why is she not wanting this you know and that's the way we should because it all gives us even close friends that will question the lord gives us those people we should sort of think hold back well why are you why is something in your spirit against us but that's the first time in a long time where here i think they've couldn't i don't think they've kiddie the way with all the children they all voted no man no stupid place not going and that was bad man and they were i'm gonna stay here like people were gonna i'm staying in this area you guys moved here i'm staying here by myself and like the whole family was going to break up it was serious man i'm like i was like oh man and shannon was all upset look now it's breaking up the whole family we're all going to be fractured now like no man i just said i just i feel that's where we should go we're just going to move there that's it and i said yes to the place yes yes yes look here yes we're going now not i was texting i'm not was it being harsh it was just like can't you see the hand of god in this whole thing i can just see the hand of god this is the direction we just need to go on it but it was difficult to push through the resistance and sometimes you have to but i wouldn't recommend you you should know when you should shouldn't you got to be but once again this is more of a it's like plastering as an actual skill you can't just say to someone go and plaster that wall you could say to someone bang a piece of board on that wall and most people could get it and bang a nail in and it could come out okay but you tell them to plaster it's a skill that you acquire over time so some of this stuff you just have to know but i believe the lord's work on each one of us we just you just know the answers you just feel it you kind of you shouldn't get wrong too many times the more you walk with the lord you should know and this is the time we're in as we're in the time of answers so so we we we moved there and we told our other neighbor down the bottom another christian family they came up to visit us and we said oh we're actually moving up to shannon and the lady that came up said that's amazing i had a dream and then i said in my dream i said isn't it funny shannon's moving to shannon she said i dreamt that shannon's moving to china are you moving to shannon here we are wow you see the cc [Laughter] no no no i often no i'm not going to confess that these days i believe the lord can give me the right answers i was going to say but i want to be wrong if i said i often get it wrong but we don't want to confess that because the lord can give us the answers that's the season we're in we're not in a season of confusion where we don't know the answers to our own lives now i'm talking about our own lives i'm talking about the answer that only you can get not me i can't get it for you like uh what should i be doing for the kingdom of god you might have that question god's got an answer for you yes amen now you must find the answer you have to but find the answer and if you believe you'll get the answer you'll get the answer this is actually a something we can lay hold of by faith you if you don't if you don't want to claim it then you will never have it but if you want to claim lord i can get the answer because we're in a time of answers that's something we can claim just like like i was going to speak that i don't really often get the answers that would be speaking unbelief that on something i'm trying to claim that's why i didn't say it and when i said it i said i don't i don't mean that you see because satan will try and twist around but it's legal stuff you know sometimes when i'm doing something and i might say something wrong out of my mouth i'll i will correct it in a legal way i'll never be able to do this you know say um but what i said wasn't true because i'm going to be able to do this you know so then if it legally comes up my word was void for what i said i said no i didn't that wasn't it matters what we say matters okay it matters so so when you want i want to confess to you the lord wants to give you the answers to this don't don't disbelieve it don't say well i'll never know you notice maybe no you will know you do have a purpose in the kingdom of god and you will get the answer amen i'm looking over at sister vanessa shannon was wondering about david and all that stuff dave was going through and she went i think to sister vanessa and sister vanessa told her i think this is true she said when i was praying about it i found that david wants to join a gang is that what she said david wants to join a gang she didn't know that david what did you want to do when you left and went out want to join a gang that like she said this is the problem he wants to join a gang and that was david's whole thing i want to join a gang and that was his motivating answer and that's what drove him i want to join a gang like we're talking like big time gangs but vanessa got the answer he wants to join a gang we had this different things he wants to do but that was a definite something in his life a demon had said join a gang and she picked that answer up the answer is he wants to join a gang prayer against that thing see we don't live in a time of confusion we live in the time of answers and if we believe it and we just receive it we can have answers we don't we're not confused amen well no i know this may not apply but who should i marry it's a big question should i marry the lord can give you the answer the lord does give you the answer he's not going to give you the wrong answer the lord's going to give you the answer yes he might say wait it's not going to be stab in the dark he might say just wait we might say this but i'm saying it's not don't think it's like there's these things out there that i just don't know no give it to the lord he'll give you an answer and i can't tell you who you're going to marry like see that's what i'm saying this is not a general answer who should i marry oh this person it doesn't bother to me who you marry so i could say anybody oh you'll make a good husband she'll make a good wife don't listen to me because because the consequences are on you you know the wrong person it's on you not me you know if you came to me i'll tell you these things okay this is that this this is what this is what i'd work within this parameter but aside from that you're on your own man sorry but the lord can give you an answer uh this is another one where should i live why are you all living here what you all live in wellington why are you here do you feel like you're here because you're supposed to be here did you get dragged here and the laws maybe then just twisted and made it work what's the like i could tell you i'm here because the lord said move here move here i didn't have any job when you turned up nothing was working and i said to like i said it doesn't matter we're going to stay here even if i have to shovel bricks rubble down at a construction site for a job i'll do it we're going to stay here and it's going to work in the story the lord put us here you should know that about where you live like it should be i'm out what piece of dirt you stay on matters it matters i don't know something something in me feels like where we live is a godly place i don't know it feels like there's a lot of churches it feels like there's a there's a spiritual atmosphere on it that's that's blessed for some you won't like it when i say this but it feels like here it's not feels like this in the heart it feels like yeah i've always felt like there's something on it i don't know what it is the same i felt and um now don't take that now that's just my thought don't take that as an answer that's my opinion the same in hawke's bay i thought around napier hastings i thought i never liked this area there's something eerie about it you come to find out there's just there's a bad spirit on there like there's something on that place and there's a lot of evil stuff happens there domestic violence and things and but up where we are it feels like this like this that's open something and it's not just naturally but it feels like there's a blessing on it some somewhere down somewhere at some point someone's done something and there's something on it just that's what it feels like to me i'm like i'm happy to be here it feels like i feel my spirit connects somehow with with this hair there's something on it because there are places brother adam said leave that place he told brothers leave that little town there's judgement on it i'd leave it if i was you don't live there where we live matters lord where do you want me to live and if you said to me oh like we said i don't mean shall i go and live here well what is there a fellowship there for one what's there you know but true but where you are matters and the lord can tell you exactly where you should be and you are supposed to be in a certain place like naomi friesen what's she doing here [Laughter] are you supposed to be here that's good see she's got a confidence towards the lord i'm supposed to be here she was born around the other side of the world why is she here because the lord brought her here for a specific purpose it's not just oh i just happened to find a ticket my parents said i'd go here and i just went you know when we're sometimes when we're non-believers that happens when we're believers we should know no i'm here because the lord led me here this is where i should be if you don't have that i suggest you ask the lord and he can tell you lord i'm actually supposed to be here we just came here when i was not a believer for a job but am i supposed to be here hope brother being one alive because maybe harder people will leave don't let i believe the lord wants you all here for good till the rapture i have been nudging the believers wouldn't it be nice to have a church more up the coasts [Laughter] you know the funny thing is in my spirit it feels like oh i wouldn't there was a time where i thought no it's not the right thing but it's like ah there's not put it this way there's not resistance to that idea it's like ah and at the moment there's actually a rent review happening here and things [Laughter] but there's but we will know that's why i often say to brother ben the lord will give you the answer i believe it you i'm not going to come here and tell you any answers bro the lord will give you the answer because you are the pastor he's going to show you and i've got confidence in that you will get shown because that's the god that we serve he wants to give us answers if we're as disciples he takes us away here's the answer we don't need to walk and not know walk in confusion unless he says just walk on you'll find out later on sometimes that's the answer but that's only but don't just sometimes we may just say oh i just don't know and i'll just walk on well no maybe prod a bit first make sure make sure that's the answer you know don't just accept that because sometimes that can be oh i'll just accept that i'm sick and i will you know just make sure that the okay i don't need to know this right now is the answer uh what church should i go to that's a genuine you need to find the answer to that because you you need to know where you are you're supposed to be there you can't just go oh just try here try the air try there when you serve the lord the lord has got a specific fellowship that you're supposed to be a part of to labor in that is the best for your your person for what is you because all churches are different they're all different flavors they're different types of different things that's just the way it is and the lord has people in different places for different reasons you have to find out where am i supposed to be you know or this one what should i do in my financial life meaning because we all have to do something to get money and otherwise we should have to death but what should i be doing what what what should i be dealing in it you and i look around you all are having to do this but but where you are currently is it what you're supposed to be doing are you confident this is exactly what the lord wants to be doing exactly you have to be confident see we live in a time of confidence towards the lord lord i know you put me in this job and i'm supposed to be here for the season then you can go there happy and go look i'm here to serve the lord i'm here in the name of the lord and i'm never going to complain about my boss or this or that because i'm here in the name of the lord i'm supposed to be here i'm not just this is not a filling this is where i'm supposed to be we can have a confidence toward god jenny's supposed to work with us for a while so jimmy said he's going to work for us forever as he said oh no no sorry i take that back he said he's going to live in wellington forever because i said oh you know you might be here and then after a while you might move on somewhere else just you know that's the lord i said i'm happy when you come but we're happy when you go you just be led by the lord you know it's not like oh when you come we're happy when you go oh we're all upset no no we need to know that people are led by the lord like brother james when you go praise the lord brother move you this is something in me felt good about it like yeah you're doing the right thing even though we lose you can't that can't be your judgment i don't want you to go because i'm going to lose right it's got to be bigger than that the lord he's got to be the lord's answer no i really fell in my spirit you're doing the right thing praise the lord so i said that to jimmy he said no no i'm going to be in wellington forever yeah he said you say that to me hey well hold him to it uh should i take that job you ever had a situation where should i take the job or not because you've got to leave one job start another one the lord can give you an answer hey your sister priscilla that was that was another one too we just said i don't know how this is going to work we'll just take her on and it's worked out really well just we don't always do decisions like that but i'm doing it more and more lately i must admit because i'm realizing that you know god knows better than any of our financial analyzing and planning of a situation can amen now people may call me stupid but it's like well this works a lot better because i serve a god that knows what the future holds knows what's going to pan out that's the god i serve and i'm actually these days more confident finding his answer even if it doesn't make sense with my numbers and everything i'm confident doing that answer because then i know it's going to be all right if i get his answer then we just go with it and that's it doesn't have to actually it doesn't have to all make sense even financially if it's his answer just just take his answer that's because we often think well it's got to make sense and i have to be able to plan it all out well we can get to a place where we can the lord's answer makes great financial sense because he's the he owns the cattle on a thousand hills he's always gonna look after us so we can just go on his answer uh yes sir what about this one should i do the certain thing as a hobby who's got hobbies you know what are they and why do you do them and should you be doing it see these things they they actually matter what do you do when you have your you don't have any free time spare time but you allocate time and you kind of should do something that that you know is a bit of a natural human thing that you have fun doing and it just you know but what i what are you doing and is it that do you feel it's the right thing for you to do like my hobbies i think yeah my hobbies i feel good about them i feel before the lord yes i'm happy doing this but we may be doing hobbies that the lord says that you're wasting your time you shouldn't be doing that nonsense but because we want to do it we don't ask the question you know because we want to do it so we don't ask but these things matter this might be funny but should i drink coffee all right you shouldn't drink v no no no no is this the v that's a good question it is actually because you know everything kind of ruins you to a small degree but some things ruin you a lot and so therefore we say we won't take that like certain uh things we can put in our body affect us really bad and then other things not as much and coffee is like yeah kind of you do the research oh it's just sort of flavor in moderation it doesn't really do too much damage to me it's sort of like you know about the same as a lollywood but you shouldn't have lost sweet too much sugar either um well i was going to say something there that was about um i've lost my maybe when i said it was i think it was about coffee but i'm not saying to not drink coffee don't get me wrong what i'm saying there are answers but but i could drink it there's there are some things that like i think coffee could be a relative one like because there are general things that we shouldn't do but there are other things that maybe it's all right for me like maybe my hobby is it shouldn't be your hobby or maybe if i drink coffee shouldn't be yours you can't come to me should i drink coffee i'm like yeah brother i drink it all the time it's the most wonderful drink in the world well i'm not the right guy to ask because i like it you see so be careful who you ask what you get advice from but you should know these things you should know am i doing this too much because the lord's got an answer for this he won't say no you're actually doing six cups of days too much and it's affecting your nervous system it's affecting how you think you're not sleeping as well as a result you're waking up a bit strong you know one of the things we need to get answers from the law is to be relaxed and the way to be relaxed is put the right food in your body get your body relaxed make it don't make it all tense have it relaxed so if you're plugging stuff in your body like v-drinks that are working up your mind too much and just making you making your edgy it's going to affect your mental capacity it's going to and then it's going to affect your connection with your spirit you're going to be a bit nervous and if you get like that you think you should think okay i need to maybe maybe if you ask the lord he might say stop doing that and you'll find that we'll have a result and make you more relaxed just i'm just saying i'm just i've almost i'm wrapping this up now these are just this you have these other questions that don't really matter like these other ones you're actually you know you're sipping on your coffee thinking should i do it should i not the answer matters you know because when you make the next one your conscience may kick in i shouldn't do it i'm just saying they matter but these there are questions that don't really matter and these we just you know like why did paul shave his head it's a new there are unusual things in the bible that we why you think no that's an unusual thing i know brother brown said to him another man thought that it was strange or something that he did and he almost thought it was a wrong thing to do or something and brother branham said to me and by the way before there was a good reason why paul shaved his head i'd like to know why he shaved his head what was the reason for that some things i just think like this i often it intrigues me about the stuff like systems they've put up i think what was the intent behind this like the federal reserve these financial systems was it evil intent all these guys just trying to make a quick buck or what was the little you know it could go either way or 9 11 stuff it's like your research you're like what's going on here last thing i don't really care but i think on the dad judgment i'd like to know these answers what happened there show me show me people's thoughts what did he think what did they think what did they do because all the answers are going to be laid out so some things i just think the answer doesn't matter so we don't need to get too worked up over it now the last one i'm going to cover is why something like it is in your life some things are just a certain way and i think you need to know why like you you need to know you should know where you're at in your life and what what is going on in your life for the direction the season you may not work in seasons but there are seasons you can't don't watch this and think oh look i better pick my season it may be relative to you it may not but but life does go in seasons things go and the lord told me this is going to be your season and it's going to come like this now because the world works in seasons oftentimes the lord does have a certain season but we can't always think like that too much because then you could say oh well a church will be okay for a while then it will go into a winter season and be no good no no it can be in a permanent uh we live in the uh on the equator you know we're just always sun shining you know so don't don't apply this to everything but you could be going through something you think why is nothing working why is it all this is just everything i work try doesn't work it's just everything's hard it could just be a winter ask the lord about it maybe it's just a season he's bringing you through maybe you don't need to do anything maybe you've done nothing wrong it's just a season just but you should know that you should know if you're in that this is what i'm in or like and brother branham said day and night he said sometimes in a family you know they might have just go through a hard time he said they're just going through a night time and as a family then they come out the dawn breaks they come out to a day time it may but then it may be something and that that there's a problem that's something you've done something something's happened to make the family like that like my the lord's often spoken to me through kings and said that the different kings in the bible and said this is you're going to be like this king for a while and you're going to have this that your life will be like his one and it was like one of them they've been quite a few one of them was david and solomon he said you'll have a time of david where you'll have to fight fight fight all the time then you'll have a time where where a sun came on it's a time of peace and when that comes you won't have to spend your time fighting you'll be able to spend the energy doing what you've been called to do like in the solomon's case it was build the temple but david spent so much time fighting he didn't have the time for it but then the lord also said don't do it but all his resources were going to fight battles but solomon had no battles so then the resources he would have spent fighting enemies he could then build up and build the temple but the lord says this is what your life's going to be it's going to be like this for a season then it will change and when the season of solomon comes it will be like this so it's not confusing and you think okay this is where it's going to be now it's just going to unfold like this and it's happening that same way i want to read you this last quote this is now more in a negative way but you need to apply this to your life as well to to to sometimes when you're wondering you can't leave any stone unturned you've got to look you've got to dig deep in the lord can give you an answer many times dealing with spiritual things you see them when they move out someone was just asking me here not long ago i was at calgary canada and the boy came in they had him in a straight jacket and they come in the back of the room and he was cursing and carrying on and i never heard such a thing in my life and the father was trying to hold him and when he got on the inside he looked over to me and said william branham you ain't got nothing to do with me this was the boy that was possessed by this spirit i believe this was it sounds like it was actually in in a church setting like this and this guy was swearing and cursing and carrying on a real commotion and then the father looked up and said he didn't even know his own name how did he know your name because it's a spirit i was standing off a great distance from him oh how he was cursing me and carrying on and he said you ain't got nothing to do with me and i asked the audience if there'd just be reverend so i was in front of an audience and this this guy was swearing in church and all that sort of stuff if there'd just be reverent the ushers came out to take him away just then i seen the holy spirit move out the angel of the lord the answer started to come i said now bring him here just a minute when they went to bring him he started kicking and frothing and biting he was a he was in a straitjacket and they brought him up close to where i was and then when the vision came and told just what it was a sin that had been committed by his father that caused the child to be in that condition and the father fell down and repented so that was probably not the answer the father was looking for no because he was saying just cast this devil out but that was the answer now i don't think he knew that was the answer otherwise he probably would have done it already yeah but the lord can give us even these answers lord what's that answer and we've got to be reverent enough before the lord and this it says here the father fell down and repented he said was it me if that's the answer i accept it forgive me see the intention of the answer was that everyone will be made free don't forget that the intention of the answer from the lord is always it's not to expose the father haha because you did this it was to make the situation to get rid of that devil that was the answer in the situation amen but this was the answer and then that spirit then and when and then when that evil stroke went from the boy thousands and thousands of people in the stampede grounds there that night looked he said it looked like a great big spider and a black shadow floating around on why it was really quite and it went around out of the place like the spirit that was on the boy just went out and it went out out of the place out through the building it went many times you see them in different forms here recently i seen one coming from a woman and it looked like a bat with great big hairs hanging under its legs and so forth its swings come right out right straight up these are wrong answers that's why i say at the start i said this is demonic these things wrong answers have demons writing on them and they're just nothing but demons like that that woman we had in the picture she's got demons on her that look like this this is how serious this stuff is we need the right answer we if we entertain these wrong answers and take them on board there's spirits on those things because we it opens up something in our mind and we let it in we don't want any of this nonsense man out of it the evil spirit so many times it's someone looking ever so beautiful on the outside if you could only look on the inside and see what it is we're dominated by a spirit i don't believe we have that here and i believe that that when we really accept christ the spirit of god does deal with a lot of spirits in us unbeknownst to us it just comes in and it just cleans it out you know when we receive the holy ghost just because i we we don't need to i think if the lord can show us we don't need to be scared but then i think we should be reverent enough to say lord search me and i i want i want if there's anything like that lord if if my life is a certain way because of something could you show me yeah and he's got the ability to show us what if if it is something like that that man there got he got his answer i reckon he was happy even though it showed he was doing something wrong he was happy praise the lord he'd even testify president i'd done this this happened that's happened then the lord revealed it now i'm free because at the end of the day we're free who cares amen i'd rather i'd rather be a bit embarrassed for a short time but be free then then take something to the grave we don't want to take these things to the grave and and live now this man could probably these both these people could have been saved on their way to heaven but it can affect their natural life yeah because that can happen we these things can just affect the capacity that we can operate here these things they they they we can have something honest that just affects how we operate like complex we're still saved it just affects how we operate matthews says ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open to you that was all i had this morning but my message from the lord for you is the lord jesus is going to give you all the answers that you need that's the time that we live in we live in a time of answers don't ever say you don't know you can say the lord hasn't shown me yet but don't ever confess that you don't know you do know the lord can the lord works and deals with each one of you and he he's going to give you all the answers that you need any questions you've got bring them before the lord you watch harry lancer he'll answer each one amen let's um let's stand this morning with a singer just sing a worship song and then we'll close thank you for your time i think i i was i wasn't intending to go that long i'm still on time but i wasn't intending to go that long and i thought i'd only be i when i saw there were items i thought good let's have heaps of
