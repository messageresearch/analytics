bring your needs bring your burdens let the Lord hear it we go through life enough we've had a really good conversation in the car as always on the way to church it's it's time to switch on you know hear you I try to tell Jonathan usually with the rugby he's playing the rock beat Jonathan Joshua's playing basketball I said get that switch get that switch on you know after the game before the game whenever it's if we can relax all right but switch on when the game is on Amazon and I don't want to say we only need to switch on for church but it's when I get into the car and I start driving there's a busy switch there's a that clicks there's a okay today is gone it's fast I can forget about the meetings I had by the way I had the whole day meetings it sucks and I could I could just leave that all behind because I know I'm on my way now my house here my my my time of fellowship my my my my my fellow brothers and sisters coming here for the same reason the same purpose not because it's

will be here because you guys are here because you invite them because you make him feel welcome and you pull on that and you get that into the atmosphere and and with his next song when that turns when that switch are made Lord prepare me what is to come tonight what's the message I need to receive what is the Destiny I need to be tomorrow prepare me prepare me lo be [Music] to be a sanctuary

are the holders I play me and make me this is what I pray eight change my heart O God make it ever true change my heart day I feel I was brother James come up on well singing I'm amazed I am I'm truly truly amazed that he loves me not that he loved me not that he's going through love me that he actually loves me in my position why am now sometimes through the day you just go Lord how can you how can you love this vessel and that makes me amazed that's a true definition of amazed I think it's it's so too much used that word that definition or struck awesome fail of words that I am amazed [Music] amazed that you love me [Music] how to your precious blood I can pardon and my scene Oh washed away all my sins are washed away I'm amazed thank you love me how you I am pardon my sin my sin away [Music] I'm amazed ah [Music] crashes flood I found and Massey [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelu aren't you amazed that he loves you that's the most amazing thing because I was not lovable and he loved I think if God so loved us he so loved you that much that we ought to love him back the way that he loved us I mean and I just believe that the Lord's going to move tonight I just feel it in my heart and I want to preach a message that's called divine love produces divine faith which will produce divine healing because it all has to be rooted somewhere and it all starts with his love and these two see what the Lord does let's be Reverend - Herrmann just lit a spirit move what really spawned my thought on this message was I've often heard brother Branham say at least you have love you can't even have faith and I really started to say what's so strong between this connection between love and faith so that's what I want to find out so let's go and turn to mark I'll leave them the verse 23 musicians thank you maybe I don't have them I I do my brother Isaac preach the other week he took the scripture and I thought man is he can I preach what I'm preparing for but I know look at just a little bit different for verily I say unto you that if James O'Day shall say unto this mountain Amen let's read that again and you put your name there because I want you to believe it but verily I say unto you that James shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea now here's the punch line to this and shall not doubt in his heart because there's a connection between your faith in your heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith do you believe that a mountain could be moved but this is a this is not a small thing this is you know something that weighs millions of tons just moved just for your faith I would call that something that would have to be a miracle yeah but I believe that it's possible so we need to turn to acts 1 verse 8 our heart has to be in a condition where it can operate that sort of faith x1a but you shall receive power you shall receive power and this power is the word is Dunamis it means virtue and strength but there's another thing under there and it says miracle-working power you'll receive you shall receive this power between after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth there's a purpose for this power it's not just I'll give you power there's a purpose a motive and an objective let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord with just open the service this evening Lord with some mighty statements that you have made Lord and maybe to the world Lord these things would just seem impossible Lord Jesus but yet to your bride Lord we just reach out and we grab these things Lord Jesus and we say that promise is mine and I'm going to take it and father I pray you'd raise the faith in this building tonight Lord that we could lay hold of any promise that we have Lord any healing we need for this body in this building Lord and anybody that would be listening Lord Jesus father may you grant it Lord and may your spirit be with us and bless our services evening I pray and ask for your strength Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen you may be seated I think the last time I stood up Piero's a little bit nervous and I got home and I received this text message from him good friend of mine and I said bro you were more you were more nervous than a Salesman selling meat spices to a bunch of cannibals so I'd just pray that the Lord yeah just let the Lord work I want this power to come into my life that power is of the Holy Ghost and it has to have a resting place it has to rest in your heart and you cannot do anything in the power of God until you have the Holy Spirit I just want to read you a couple of quotes I'm going to read you know just lay a foundation for this God perfecting his church all Christianity has wrapped up and one big love affair don't you believe that see love is the most perfect thing in the Bible God is love and they that love are of God said johnsy luck most perfect thing in the Bible so if you're going to have anything that's perfect perfect faith perfect killing anything has got to start with perfect love it's the most perfect thing there is when you think of all that God's done and the most perfect thing in the word is love and perfect faith you see and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a God that was the very essence of love faith and love works together if we're going to do anything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if we're going to achieve anything for his kingdom we have to have love it has to be rooted in your heart you can have love on a superficial level right figlio love love because someone did something good for you but that's not the kind of love we're talking about I'm talking about the love of God when someone stabs you in the back and you say Lord forgive them save them Lord speak to on but figlio love just has a different emotion that's attached with it what I really want to get to you is the difference between hope and faith because you can have hope but hope doesn't have a resting place when you hope for something you just well I really want this to happen but it doesn't have a foundation it's not grounded in anything you have to have faith as soon as we let fear come into your heart rather Isaac talked about this fear if we do you think fear wrists fear wrists in your heart fears not on the outside fears and the heart because you believe it you now put your faith you now believe in this thing that's coming up scared you're scared to do it it's that race here I was thinking about Peter walking on the water and the Lord just started speaking about this and I want to read through the story we're going to have a bit of a Bible study so if you go to Matthew 14 I just started reading this and I really started enjoying it so if you can all read it if not I'll read it out anyway so blessed by the hearing of the word anyway Matthew 14 23 and Jesus has just been talking to the people and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone now when I read the scripture and I read about a mountain and I read about their evening time something just begins to crack little ears up and I say Lord this maybe there's just something here that's a a little bit more walking what are you trying to show me but the ship now was in the midst of the sea tossed with waves but the wind was contrary and I began to think you know there was a bride in this ship yeah it was a bride in this ship and it was in the middle of the sea you know the world as a sea the sea is of people and there's a bride and a ship in the middle of the sea and she's been tossed cos at Satan's Eden and there's a battle raging and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea right at the last moment not the first box on the second wash and the third watch at the fourth watch and I believe that we are now in the fourth watch we right at the end time very few things have to happen we're right in the fourth watch right at the end and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled this is amazing they were troubled saying it's a spirit and they cried out the fear fear and what's happened today there's been all these things happened that we've seen since 63 a cloud appeared we've seen the word coming open and all these sounds and what it people saw something coming upon the sea they saw Jesus coming down but they didn't know what it was so they cried out with fear oh is this how it says who is this and they cried out for fear because they didn't understand well they didn't have faith to believe that's why there's been so much fighting in the message you know that's why there's been so much division even right now I'm not talking about 30 years ago because it still happens it's a spirit and an innocent of the church and that can still happen today and it's because of fear because somebody sees something and I don't agree with what they say and now fear what are they wrong what if we're wrong if he comes in but straightaway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord now What did he say if Lord if ever it be there but me to come to the on the water so there was a question and as hard it was a question it's a little doubt effort be there and Jesus and he said come and when Peter came down out of the ship he walked on water to go on Jesus if Peter actually walked on the water when he heard Jesus say come there's so many people today hear Jesus say come come come this requires an action if he saying come then you need to step out of the boat like all this boats a safe place you know nobody looks at me funny and it's just comfy in this little spot but you've got to get out off the boat because you're about to operate your faith and walk on the water but it requires your action to the Lord speaking to you no shame don't turn him down yeah but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and began to sink he cried out saying lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto Him o thou of little faith where did us doubt doubt he doubted in here if if thou be the Son of God you need to know that this message is the truth that thus message as Jesus Christ and then when he took his eyes off Jesus Amen he stepped out of the boat if it's been our Lord yet kiss me come come oh but look at these wife and David coming out fishing with me the other day and we were bouncing through those waves are big waves and the next thing was big wave straight over the boats slap me in the face another one went down my back but I had to keep looking to where we were going because if I started to look around the next one you know knocked me out of the boat you have to keep your eyes on Jesus or you'll begin to sing when fear comes and replaces the love that should be in your heart yeah he had walked on water you know the same thing can happen to us in a trial and we pray for you know and you walk out you're stronger I'm claiming this as mine it's my victory I've got this and then things get a little bit worse and you know another pain comes up and you know all I remember that that pain is in this part of the body and now something starts turning in the mind and then you go well if I just google it you know like there might be an herbal remedy for it that replaces faith in the heart and we trade our faith for understanding brother Branham here in fellowship now we have great things that we can do in the realm of faith faith works great things for us and you can't have faith till you have love that's just all there is to it perfect love casts out all fear as long as you've got fear you you can't have faith so you've got to have love first it drives all fear out and then faith comes in takes the place of fear so when you have that you're coming right along amen I bet there's somebody in here that's walked on water who's walked on water amen amen who's been to ice skating ring who's been ice-skating that's water what let you skate on that water your your intellectual believing understood that if that water was hard that you would be able to skate on it so now through your five senses you've walked on water because you had faith and what you know that that water's hard now what have you apply that same faith to that raging sea what stops you I will it's a raging sea and as water and so now reasoning this the stupid nanus this carnal flesh that stops us but when the five senses fail us is another sense that God has given us and that sense of you operator will let you walk on the water because all of this is what you believe in your heart will I believe that water will not support my way but when you know when you have faith when you believe and it's rooted and grounded you can walk on that water nothing is going to stop you like brother Isaac was saying the human has a creative power but without God that power is limited you know this wisdom has started right back in the Garden of Eden why did why did Eve need anything more than what God had given her they already had what they need they could speak something into existence but Satan used reasoning and the mind to overcome what God had already told her in her heart I'll just read this in proverbs 23 verse 7 it says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he well I think I've in my mind no you think in your heart that's why when you talk to somebody what's coming out of their mouth is actually a reflection of what's in their heart so if you're talking to a pastor and all he talks about us of word cuz he's feeding and there's a love in his heart and that's what comes forth but then you might meet somebody else and all they want to talk about is what what they did in the garden on on you know built a fence and and did this and did this and because something's producing from the heart and it's coming out yeah so what you've what's in your heart will reflect in your life and you know it makes people uncomfortable it makes people insecure when they don't have they know it cuz you know when you're not right with God and I can say I'm not right with God I want to be so much closer to God I believe there's still space that I can cram a bit more regard into this heart and when you come and you meet somebody that's just got a bit more than what you've got a good man man do I know God you know I want to have what they have there's a place and a human heart that is designed for God to dwell and if you resist that something else will take that place in your heart what it takes to overcome all bill all unbelief now many times I know all Christians know this that people will think well it just can't happen but yet in my heart there's something that tells me it's going to happen that you ever have that experience you Christians sure you have that's the inside man thinking it cast downs reasons it doesn't have anything to do with reasoning because with God God's Word should not be reason we can not reason out God God has never known by science never is God known by mental powers God is only known by faith knowledge we'll never get a man to God knowledge takes them away from God you cannot come into this rapture through understanding what the scriptures say about the rapture whenever we reason over a situation this situations come up what you floods have been going through I'm gonna say what it is but been going through a situation now what's in the heart will produce an outcome you're going to say I have faith for this and this is what's going to happen and then what's and the heart will produce the outcome and not not reasoning not well you know this is this and this is this that's not what I'm holding on to I'm holding on to a promise that God has given me I mean if their hearts so full with the divine love of God your faith will be unstoppable there'd be no power in hell that can stop it that will push itself out onto the battle front and stand and fight we've just got to make sure we keep in their atmosphere and keep that divine love there because when something else comes in and takes that place you'll be defeated I was thinking about it like Sampson what a sorry sight this mighty warrior you know he had it in his heart that he was going to fight for the Lord yeah he was going to defeat the Philistines it was the will of God it was their land and he was going to defeat them and he picked up that jawbone you know I would have rather packed up a stick than a jawbone but he picks up a jawbone and just starts smacking these Philistines with beer you know and just like brass helmets and smashing them and you would have thought man this guy has got to be the most powerful man in Israel but then something happened in his heart because he gave his heart to a girl that he was not supposed to be with and when he gave his heart away he still had the faith he tried to break the courts he tried to use his power but something had changed in the place of his heart and when he went to call upon that power the Holy Ghost was not there and he had no power to draw he had given place to something else desperations we must have loved before we can have faith and faith when we have genuine love what does it what does it do it pushes our faith out onto the battlefront for God's see genuine godly love for God and His Word and for his people will push faith out there love just takes hold of faith and justice come on let's go let's go and out it goes because that's what loved us what was it in the young King David that could fight that giant all the rest of Israel was running scared they were scared fear fear in their hearts I was thinking you know David wasn't looking at that giant going he's pretty big a and he's thinking well I wonder if I should weigh these stones you know cuz that heads pretty big and you know I wonder if the slings just getting a little bit worn out maybe I'll just go down to the armory and buy the latest pipe out night-vision heat-seeking sling you know he had faith and what he had he couldn't put his faith in some fancy long-range sling I've seen this in the nature I've seen guys hunt and they go out and spend $20,000 on gear and they look ridiculous and they go out there of a painted face all this gear and they come back with nothing and they're sad wouldn't get anything and I've seen it and you see this guy walk into the bush he's got a ripped up old spawn dry he's got a rusty old 303 on his back with no sights on it and he walks out there and you go who you think man that guy's not gonna do very good and he comes out with a deer on us back and let's go see now you apply this and the spiritual you've got to have your faith tested you've got to know that what you're using is going to work you have got to know when you apply the Word of God that it is going to work David's weapon wasn't the slingshot they were could have slung a tea bag of that valour and he what it wasn't the stone that killed Goliath our weapons are not carnal but they're mighty we fight not against flesh and blood he was fighting demons he was finding wicked powers and it was his faith that killed Goliath your faith needs to have a strong hold in your heart sinking why could David defeat that giant why am it was so many men in that land that were more able than he was to fight that giant but David was a man after God's own heart that's why he could defeat that giant because he had the love of God and as high and if he was going to do something for God he was going to stand up and have faith in it I bet he thought if he kills me I die what's the words what's the worst that can happen you know but he knew that he could fight that giant he knew he could take him down he had a revelation and faith is a revelation David wanted to be the dwelling place of God he wanted to be the dwelling place of God I read this to second Corinthians 6:16 and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols the ye are the Temple of the Living God ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people if we aren't getting the victories that we should be getting in our life we need to say where is the Lord in my life Lord this is your dwelling place come and and take control David knew it wasn't his own strength that would defeat Goliath but it was God walking her and him and that revelation was in his heart no power of Hell could take it from Ephesians 3 verse 16 I want you to read this I like the scripture or if you could bring it up maybe that would be easier visions 3:16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory I like that the riches of his glory the Lord has a treasure treasure chest the riches of his glory so many things come out of this treasure chest but this promise to be strengthened with his might with it with might by his spirit and the inner man so your strength comes from the inner man not this man not the mind not your thinking that's not strength that's false it's fake that will deceive you strength comes from the inner man all humans are led by their heart unbelievers are led by their heart if they have a sexual spirit they lead into that type of thing of you doesn't matter what you are if you have Christ in your heart now he leads you and guides you as you walk by the inner man amen you know your church affiliation will not save you you say well I got a kind of tabernacle one thorn pretty good doesn't mean nothing doesn't mean nothing well I go to such and such big names which in America doesn't mean nothing you belong to Jesus Christ when you you know how are you saved when Christ comes to you and says Nadine come you're my child and you go a man that's nothing but the truth I believe it and you'd line up with Christ because now you enter into a relationship and when he has come see it's not just when he's come but when he comes to you when he comes to you it says a spirit of truth will lead you and guide you into all truth I don't want to trust in my flesh this flesh is so deceiving you have to let him come into this soul room and you have to let them come into every little door on every little room you are a three-room house your brother branham's is at your a three-room house body soul and spirit three rooms and he says it's the kitchen the living room and the bedroom but some people who only want to let Christ come into the kitchen yeah and and what are they give mechanics okay in the kitchen you you know cooking you learn to prepare Nadine we got married she learns how to cook for me and it's a mechanic's now operating but Christ wants more than that he just doesn't want to provide for your needs Oh Lord I need this oh here you go Charlie here you go my wife is that there's more to your Christian walk than there then you have to let them come in a little bit deeper and you and you invite them into the living room because now you're married and you want to get to know each other better so you start having fellowship in the living room and you get to know one another but still there's something that just you need to come a bit more because there's a little spot that's reserved in the heart and then you let them come right into the bedroom and that's now where the you the two come together and they unite because it has to be a uniting between you and you and your bridegroom and when that takes place in the dynamics come so when you've got the mechanics and you've got all these things lined up together and then you meet Christ personally he's come to you now he comes right in and he rests and here in this little place in your heart the divine love of God and now that just comes through and it produces and a faith but until that takes place you can't have genuine faith for genuine divine healing there is every one of you can reach out and take any promise of God and operate it and I hope we can get there your heart is the soul room and you know that's surrounded by the twenty-four elders your ropes 24 reps this is the sole room and the resting place of God makes me think of Revelation chapter five you know is there something taking place in here inside of you is a mighty warrior and when I read Revelation chapter flight I are I place that as myself now I think that's me that's what I'm doing right now and I love it because it's the third pole coming up right now and that's what all this is about is what about all this message is about it's about you coming into that place where you line up with your theophany you line up with what's taking place from before the foundation of the world you recognize you know what I've already won I've already won this fight I've already been healed I already have a healed body that I'm going back to a men you've let him come right into the holiest place of your heart and he's leading you so I you know it just makes me think of when the Lord said to job when job is said where where you joke where we when all the sons of God shouted for joy not when some of the good sons you know not when they're really on fire sons of God shouted for joy when all the sons of God shouted for joy well you know I'm just just not that kind of believe you know like I'm just the quiet father you know I just it's not me but all the sons of God shouted for joy that's your theophany you know brother Branham said these three kinds of believers in the church every Church start hiding but the believer that I see here in this job is shouting for joy that's the real believer you know so if you're not that kind of believer there's only two other believers it's the Nate believer and unbeliever right but I'd want to say brother Branham said these three types of believer in every person because you might have a seed of God that's lying there yeah and there's something pulling pulling it out of you and you're resisting it Lord but he's pulling it out of you and you have that experience oh man you know that unbelievers the guy that won't get out of bed in time on a Sunday morning he said he's in you you know that that's real man that's so tired this morning then you fight the blankets and this is bad all the white dog and then black dog was fight going on but the one you feed the most will win that's the unbeliever and the make believer he's the guy that comes to comes to church you know he's dress real smart new suit looks pretty good dress for the occasion but for some reason he can't seem to connect with that guy there that's shouting for joy you can't connect with us the often it is just a tear maybe that sprung up there's a something that's greater for the love of God and his heart than the word but yet the seeds in there it's predestinated what's stopping you you know all that you're missing out on is victory yeah well you know you have it it's there but through fear well if I stand up and shout and clap they're gonna think I'm nuts the world may think you're nuts I won't think you're nuts all go praise God hallelujah and shout with you amen that's right hallelujah you cannot come into this message through into intellectual understanding of the foundation of the church our fathers tried ER and they fought tooth and nail and it didn't produce a rapture in faith bride there still it just didn't because only love will produce this you come in by faith and faith as a revelation of God's Word and then and it's quickened to you when you hear it and that's seed and it just says Amen I want it and it burst forth and it comes out and this is what I believe is the new birth you know as so it tomb so mostly used and within Christianity a new birth what sort of question here well I'm a born-again Christian well what were you born again for him because to me your new birth as when you say that person and Joe that shouted for joy that that was your theophany and you go that's me that's me and Christ is yes you're mine and you say hallelujah I see it I've got it then you've new birth and it's a mess brother branham see what cuz you cry and you shout and you sing hallelujah because if now something has been birthed in you and that's why people fear because a booth is always messy and I don't want the mess I don't want to miss this ashamed well that's just a shameful thing I don't want to look like that and you hold back and the only thing you really hold back is the victory you have to receive the promise of God faith has to have an action when the word has revealed to you ministers will know this when the virtus revealed to you you were responsible to give an action to what is revealed to you so if something is revealed to you and then you do nothing with it why would God God why would he give you more or you didn't do anything with what I gave you you're responsible to do something whether it's the same thing for you for any of you if God reveals something to you he reveals you know what I want you to go and I want you to go and bless this brother and do such and such a thing and then you don't do it well what if he can't trust you to do something with what he's given you he's not going to give you more I was thinking of that you remember the story and brother Brandon was preaching at a minister's church and his daughter was grieved at what he was preaching he was talking about their clothes and hair and makeup and this woman was grieved in her heart as he was preaching and she come up to brother Brennan after the service and she said how dare you preach that and my father's Church and she was grieved but God was calling upon her heart yeah he was trying to work he was trying to she was saying this is right this is truth I know that this is the truth but I hate it and I'm resisting it and he said she grieved the Holy Spirit for the last time because there comes a time when you can turn the Holy Spirit down for the last time that's a powerful thing and I remember he said he met that girl later on down maybe a few years later and he wanted to cross the road cuz he's seen her coming and she was a mess and he stopped then he talked to her and she had become so hardened in her heart that she said I don't have anything to do with it I could watch my parents soul burn and Helen it wouldn't touch me yeah what is what a condition the devil was so so evil yeah he promises you everything and robs you of you he has got nothing he can give to you nothing at all she turned down the Spirit of God for the last time if God is moving you I just pray that you would give an appropriate reaction to what God is calling in your heart don't turn them down I'll skip a little bit because I don't want to keep you here all night how I love this word so much I love this study the rapture but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation - it is revealed to her that the revelation the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture I'm not waiting for a revelation you might be waiting for the revelation but I'm not waiting for the revelation of the rapture because it's taking place in me right now where I am being called up and I hear God I feel and pulling me up and it's changing me it's changing the way I act it's changing the way I think as changing the decisions that I make every day in my life because I have a revelation of this rapture now as a revelation for the revelation as faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith as a revelation because it's something that's been revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to them as though it wasn't so so if God says to you that you're healed and then the devil comes in incisional not healed you say devil I don't believe you flee from me God said I'm here that's faith that's a revelation of his word that can call anything else country nothing false wrong don't believe you see them go home I've got no time for you and then the whole church is built upon revelation the whole entire body amen when God gives you a promise it's a revelation you just need to reach out and claim it that's yours you know if you don't you're holding on to the promise the promise has been made you're holding on to it but you're not claiming it you're not acting on it I don't believe what happened to that promise I had you done act on it and it left you a requires action yeah it requires a resting place in your heart that will hold that promise there Ephesians 3:17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded and love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth all knowledge and be filled with the fullness of God we should be able to come to with you together and agree because of something that is rooted and grounded in our heart you know when the Holy Ghost fell the disciples were in one Accord they were they were they were together believing that the promise was coming they went and they're going well such and such the derson that one's going will such and such with us and I'll take my show off and hurt that one you know like they were in one Accord and the power of God shook that building the Holy Ghost filled it we say well Lord where are you I said well I'm trying to come in I'm knocking at your heart what are you doing about it you want to see me you want to be healed but you won't even let me come into your heart oh lord have mercy your faith must be rooted deeper than your heart so it cannot come out because you can have faith in the wrong things I've had faith in the wrong things and I've seen power work when I was young before I was a Christian I had dabbled in spiritualism things and I had seen miraculous things before I even believed in a god I had seen spirits do supernatural things what through my faith and then but that faith was limited was limited because the devil has no power he only perverts what God has but he doesn't have any of his own power Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worker than us amen according to the power that worketh and us even the fact that it says above all that we ask or think because we can't even think with this you cannot use this it comes from the heart God can produce what you can not even imagine when it seems impossible I can't buy a house I don't have the money God can he can provide hell I don't know I can't this thing here cannot produce the thought to do it but God can through my faith that worketh than me even more than what I think the Satan does not have that kind of power that's a limited and without without the love of God anything that you have any power that you have will be just won't operate because you're asking this well Lord I want this you ask him as he says well I don't want you to have that so you're not going to have it because you're asking this because power without character satanic how then God likes to mold character because he's trying to you know you cannot get to heaven on a flowery bitties well if I just be a Christian this will all just be easy that's not going to happen that's going to be hard it's a hard road but he's calling you closer to him you know they came to a point in Billy Paul's life where he'd come at a crossroads and brother branham said look Billy Paul right now you're standing at a crossroads and there's two paths that you can take you can take the path that's right and what we have will not much just joy and salvation and what you'll follow me around and you'll watch the power of God heal people and the Holy Ghost fall or or you can take this other road and what will you see a failed marriage drunk diseases right to the point where God brought him to his deathbed yeah and he was dying and the doctor said I cannot save him I can't he's gone I can't do anything and he said dad saved me and brother Brennan said until you make things right with God there's no use of me even praying because God's not going to hear you need to get yourself right with God and I will pray he chose the wrong road but every road there was available to take that Satan just likes to pull you away it's just he's good at it he's practiced he's been doing it for a while perfect faith and when you've got pure unadulterated faith like your lovers to get your companion then you prove it by the way you act you aren't complaining no more you know it's done just walk along no matter what the thing looked like what anybody else say is you know what's happened you know that it's finished just as well as you know that you love your husband as well as you know you love see love and faith goes together that can folks love produces faith when Satan tempts us we are too resistant and a perfect faith and a perfect word like Jesus did the Word of God is perfect we're to have a perfect faith and this perfect word and resist Satan I mean what is what could be more perfect have you been going through your fair share of trials and hard times don't complain just think of the power that God is wanting to manifest through your life through the character he's developing and someone is going to have to do the greater works you know when Jesus walked upon this earth and his flesh what did he do talk of fish and he created more fish he took the bread and he break more bread but we've seen something greater in this day because we've had a prophet come upon the land and he's created and spoken squirrel's into existence where there was no squirrels and he brother branham turns around near the end of his ministry and says we're going to do the greater works because where there was nothing we Skinner speak it into existence somebody is going to speak something into existence when those squeeze come on and we can't buy anything we have no petrol we have no food we're going to have a little prayer meeting in here I don't think it'll be a lot it was gonna be is these will be that believers shouting for joy and somebody is going to speak something into existence just going to appear hallelujah we have to stop thinking human thoughts and start letting God think through our heart and produce perfect faith and now we become anointed with that same spirit anointed messiahs messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a lover fear to hear pouring out unto her himself they are becoming one hallelujah they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God and the same word as making the same manifestations Amen the same things he did I'm doing you want to see what God did just follow me for a little bit because what he did I'm gonna do sooner or later that's just going to happen it's just going to operate it's just the way it is it's going to be somebody that needs a new leak and they're going to come through this prayer line and they're going to come down here on one leg and they're going to walk out with two legs it's just going to happen I believe it amen that's gonna skip some more things don't keep you too hard now this thought came for me last night and I just really wanted to go through brought what brother branham said about it when you can apply this when you can really dig down and find the divine love in your heart and let it produce faith when you can have this all lined up that's going to produce something amazing and so brother Brennan here he's now been telling the story about when he spoke these squirrels into existence sitting in a little farm cottage out in the middle of nowhere and group of people around him listening to him and something's gonna take place a story of sister Hattie my new ministry and why we were talking I said I want to ask you something what put those squirrels there I believe those squirrels with you I don't believe this as a story something put those squirrels there it was a condition that the Prophet had that curry could create these squirrels because I've been hunting before and my faith was in an amazing place but there was something missing and I got to that clearing and I said Lord there's going to be a 12 points tag on that clearing and I so believed it and I got there and there was no development statement something was not quite ready for that to produce but it has been done because there's already been a first fruits of this resurrection and it will be done again there is no squirrels in the woods I had hunted and hunted and I'm not the best hunter yeah but I've hunted since I was a little boy and I had hunted close and they were in and they were in the most ridiculous place and in the most ridiculous way I could call them I see what put them there so now the Lord has told him say we do you want to scroll he said well and that's silly place over there where you'd never see a scroll this is supernatural I said that same God hallelujah that Jehovah Jireh he's just as much Jehovah Jireh as he was on the Mount with Abraham he can still produce an animal to his glory these squirrels was not a vision I shot them blood came out of them I dress them and eat them they wasn't visions they were squirrels I said that same Jehovah Jireh trying to get his promise over to me and my thickness and dullness of mind oh boy how many times has it happened to us he's trying to get something to you when you're so clouded because of the things that enter this mind he could speak my need into existence the same as he could speak Abraham's need into existence I know Moore said there until sister had he's sitting there crying now hadn't said a word and she said that's nothing but the truth she had the appropriate reaction to what was being spoken and she said Amen I believe that nobody's done that but I believe it I believe it she said the right thing and that's super anointing swept over me I said tell Hattie that she's found grace in the sight of God who would have thought said tell her to ask whatever she will then you speak it by this gift you speak it by this gift you speak why this gift into existence whatsoever she asked it speak it into existence I look to sister Hattie the first time that was ever performed on a human being and see it's just a heady ask what you well God is going to give it to you God is going to give it said ask what you will heady said to me brother Brennan what do you mean asked for you will anything ask what you will I said anything your heart desires the Lord show when you think your heart desires it shall be produced right here that you'll know that the Lord God of heaven answers and our scriptures are true anything your heart desires not what your flesh desires asked what your heart desires God knew what this woman was going to ask for she had a pure heart this was a Christian woman this was not a make believer was not an unbeliever God knew that she had a pure heart you know why do you need to move this mountain what's your motive and objective to make that mountain move if you have the wrong way to go I just want to move the mountain over there well doesn't matter to thousand people on the other side of the mountain die what's your motive for moving the mountain if your motive is not pure God will not move my first time with the new gift my first anointing I could hardly hear her and she looked around we had been talking about her little crippled sister I said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little Edith will be jumping for the glory of God little crippled girl sitting there you know that would be a good cause for the power of God right yeah amen but that wasn't what was in her heart she had something far greater had he looked around all around she said brother bill my greatest desire is for the salvation of my two boys what why they couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for $10,000 she would have got it what I've had it have been some millionaire he would have asked for another million she had a pure heart he says God knowed what she was gonna ask for I said ask anything you want because God has give it to me to give to you whatever you want she said her boys was beginning to go off on the teenage tantrum and she said the salvation of my two boys another place I remember brother Brennan said those boys were sitting in the corner laughing and mocking what was brother Brennan was talking about disrespectful to God's prophet yeah and I said by the will of God by the power of God I give you in the name of Jesus Christ your desire and no two boys shook under the power of and that whole building trembled banks fell into his plate shall be grabbed and had he screamed till you could hear from two blocks and them two boys with tears running down their cheeks received exactly what they asked for right then oh the first time it was ever used on a human being ask what you will and it shall be given unto you who boys sitting a beer in the service that morning amen a pure heart a pure desire a pure love a pure faith producing the uttermost result and that's what we have you know I see divine love for divine faith for divine healing but I want to say for divine rapture as well because for you to have a rapture for you to have a body change you're not just going to walk into this you have to have something that's taken place in your heart because when you get on that other side you're still going to be the same person when I get there I'm still going to be James O'Day and if I don't love my brother or sister right now I won't love them over there it has to be something that's taken place in you now before you get there because death does not change you it only changes your dwelling place Lord created me a clean heart give me a pure heart give me the love of God I want to see that I want to see this take place in our church I want to see the sick healed I want to see faith operated in simplicity because it's not something that you can't obtain God does not give you a promise that you cannot obtain he's faithful to meet everything that he has promised you and you just claim it and say Lord it's mine devil back off devil you flee you have nothing you cannot hold us there's people that will claim this and we'll take this victory and run with it amen if you can come to crisis evening with a pure love in your heart for this word and believe casting down all imagination all reasoning and have faith to believe for the things that are impossible to man if you have a pure mode of an objection if your request matches the will of God ask what you will and it will be given to you anything Matthew 7:7 he said ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened I mean maybe the musicians could come maybe we could just play only believe softly please I just want to say what do you have need of tonight because we are a needy people and if you have need for this love that we've been talking about why don't you why don't you claim that tonight maybe you don't need to find healing but you need the love that will operate that power when you have need of it because what people do is they wait until they have a need and they say Lord I have a need but they're not ready to operate the gift I want to be ready now so when the need arises I can say Lord I need I need this and I believe my heart's in a place that it can operate and then I just need to speak it so simple faith so simple just speak it ask what you will it shall be given unto you if you ask from a pure heart if it's the will of God ask and it shall be given unto you Amen you know I'm not where I want to be right now right in my spirit I want to be higher I want to be yeah I want to start seeing this hand just becoming translucent and sort of us one with doesn't look so worn and calloused just appearing you know I want to be that high oh I want to see the image of my real self Amen I want to come that close to God and he will come to you if you ask him right now he will come to you if you haven't come to that place he will come to you but he will not force himself upon you he will not come upon your heart with a hammer and start hitting it I want to come in I want he will not force himself on you he's a genuine man he will come and he'll speak I love you you're my bride I love you I love you I'm amazed that he loves me but he's not forcing himself upon me he wants me to come out of my own well to him Amen hallelujah you must open that door to your heart don't miss us faith and simplicity you do not need a grief or a degree for us not science it's just a love affair between you and Christ amen maybe we could just stand I just want to close in prayer and I just want to read just want to read one more quote maybe if we just bow our heads and if you have a need you can raise your hand to the Lord and and we'll just pray this is coming into that third Paul I'm believing it now I want to ask you us and see a question you that pass through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel now that there's something happened in you since you've had lit hands laid on you raise your hand there it is this is what we've waited for this is just starting to bloom see I did this for a purpose I'm working something out that's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in to kind of raise faith in a bracket we have never noticed it this way before not just a faith but a perfect faith build it up in here and watch a perfect God with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by His perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now as waiting for the church to come into that perfect rapture faith looking for it and means a lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God amen hallelujah Lord Jesus I know father it means a lot of shaving down for me Lord Jesus hallelujah Lord this thing's Lord that take residence in our heart Lord Lord that at times they raise up and they just they take our love away from You Lord Jesus hallelujah lord I just pray you'd shave them down Lord just shave off Lord till this nothing but your pure love in my heart Lord Jesus father I pray for your people Lord for these brothers and sisters Lord Jesus Lord shave them down Lord Jesus Lord create a clean heart father fill it with faith Lord Jesus rooted and grounded in love Lord Jesus Lord may we be able to speak Lord and claim what we ask for Lord Jesus father we know that anything that you will grant at Lord Jesus and there's so many things we ask for here Lord and I believe Lord that you will provide at Lord Jesus father may you help us to operate a sixth sense Lord Jesus that same sex sense Lord that stopped the mouths of lions Lord Jesus the same sixth sense Lord that couldn't drown Paul in the sea hallelujah Lord the same sixth sense Lord that brought down the walls of Jericho hallelujah the same sixth sense Lord Jesus that broke down the walls of the prison that held Peter father Lord there's been wolves that have held back your bride Lord Jesus and I pray through that sixth sense Lord those wolves will be broken tonight Lord Jesus hallelujah Satan you have no power over this congregation we rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ take your hand off these people devils of sickness flee in the name of Jesus Christ take your hand off the children take your hand off the youth of this place take your hand off the adults Lord Jesus we just thank you lord we believe your word we believe that you've moved in a way tonight Lord that's raised our faith in a bracket we can grow closer to you Lord Jesus we believe that Lord and we thank you Lord Jesus we just pray now Lord the words being spoken there's been a reaction Lord there's been an action to what's being quickened on the heart father now we just ask that you will come down Lord and there you'll move an hour Matt's laws Lord as we sing to you just what we believe in our heart Lord hallelujah we thank you Amy [Music] all things Oh [Music] Oh oh lord I believe [Music] [Music] oh jesus is here he's here tonight yes Lord [Music] Jesus [Music] all

say to us tonight get out of the boat yes don't just stay there and say yes but get out of the boat and when he was talking about sister Hetty right I put myself in the story we were I've been listening to brother ed bicycles testimony and he was up northern British Columbia and and brother Brown was there with them with Budd Southwick and his family and God just came down and they were so gripped by the atmosphere and he said brother Brahim said that the pillar of fire is not a few feet from any one of us and the reason he said that is that the people would reach out in faith because God was in the room hallelujah and I believe that our Lord Jesus the same God that visited them there is present now hallelujah so don't just don't just say yes but say yes Lord you're here for me are you here to meet my need a menace as brother brother was saying about how Hetty writes it there's nothing but the truth and that super anointing came down hallelujah I believe that he is here to meet a need we're not here just to go through a church service we're here that God would come and do the impossible and because we need him to do the impossible and because there's many things that we are facing we cannot change we cannot do anything we need him to come and him to come and meet the need and I believe that he is present to meet your need so if you would like to say if you want to step out of the boat irrespective of what the storm is doing and so I'm walking I'm walking to you my lord you want to step forward it for pray you're more than welcome to come because I believe Jesus is
