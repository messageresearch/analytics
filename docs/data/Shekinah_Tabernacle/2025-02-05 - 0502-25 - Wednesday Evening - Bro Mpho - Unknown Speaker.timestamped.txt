[29:08] wonderful sacrifice Lord we would have
[29:10] been
[29:12] lost but father because you knew us
[29:14] before the foundation of the world Lord
[29:16] you knew us before you formed even this
[29:20] the universe you knew us father and you
[29:23] knew us by name and you predestinated us
[29:26] father that the fact that you knew us
[29:29] Lord just give us courage
[29:32] tonight to know you as well and I pray
[29:35] my heavenly father tonight that you'll
[29:37] bless us as a collective that you'll
[29:40] bless us as
[29:41] individuals that you can speak to us as
[29:43] a church that you can speak to us as
[29:46] individuals you are a personal god
[29:48] father and Lord I believe that tonight
[29:51] as you speak your children will benefit
[29:54] something and they'll take something
[29:56] home Lord bless bless every ear and
[29:59] every heart and bless the speaker as
[30:02] well father forgive us our wrongs and
[30:03] our mistakes because we are born in sin
[30:08] shaped in iniquity without you lord
[30:10] there's nothing good in us and I pray
[30:13] therefore my father my God that we
[30:15] confess our sins we confess our our
[30:18] secret faults Lord even those that are
[30:21] hidden from us I pray that you wipe them
[30:23] up with your blood settle your children
[30:26] father and I pray as we invite you and
[30:29] welcome you in our midst in the name of
[30:31] our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God
[30:34] bless you please enjoy the comfort of
[30:36] your
[30:38] seeds so um tonight I would like to
[30:42] speak about the
[30:45] subject called to know him is life
[30:49] eternal to know him is
[30:54] life I I didn't hear this side to know
[30:56] him is life ET Eternal so forgive me
[31:01] once more once again I like to interact
[31:05] and talk to people you know as we as we
[31:08] speak but um I so much wish brother Ben
[31:13] that the friend SE were filled you know
[31:15] that's my my my prayer my desire but I
[31:19] understand you sit where you are
[31:21] comfortable you
[31:23] see to know
[31:26] Jesus I I'm taking it along the side
[31:29] that says you know in the Bible the
[31:32] Bible will say that and so and so knew
[31:35] his wife and he bore him a
[31:38] son and then he knew him he knew her and
[31:41] he bore him a
[31:43] daughter that's the kind of knowing that
[31:46] I'm talking about in the spiritual realm
[31:50] I'm talking about knowing Jesus
[31:55] intimately knowing him not not not
[31:59] feeling him not feeling like you have
[32:02] him you know knowing him because to know
[32:06] him is life the Bible says are we
[32:09] together so in the spiritual realm
[32:12] things do
[32:14] happen you know the scripture that says
[32:16] if you look to a woman and you last
[32:18] after her you have already committed
[32:21] adultery with that D if you last after
[32:23] him so there has been a connection but
[32:27] physically you were just walking or
[32:29] sitting or whatever you were doing you
[32:32] haven't done anything physically but the
[32:34] Lord says you have already committed sin
[32:37] how in the spiritual realm are we
[32:41] together and that's what I'm talking
[32:42] about that we need to know Jesus Christ
[32:45] that
[32:46] intimate until you and him me and him
[32:50] are one because that's what he said I
[32:53] will be in you you in me and we will be
[32:56] one
[32:58] you agree with me amen I I want us to
[33:02] walk together so because you see to know
[33:06] your
[33:07] church or to know your pastor to know
[33:11] your Deacon to know your friends to
[33:15] know even I like what other friend I
[33:19] listen to a seron this afternoon he just
[33:21] said what I wanted to say if I'll even
[33:24] tell you that to know the Bible
[33:29] that cannot give you eternal life just
[33:30] to know the Bible many people know the
[33:32] Bible the theologians they know it
[33:35] better than me and you even the
[33:37] devil he knows the Bible so even to know
[33:41] the Bible and the spoken words Cote from
[33:43] cover to cover to know it in that
[33:46] knowledge mental
[33:47] knowledge won't give you eternal
[33:50] life but I'm talking about the
[33:53] knowing of knowing him that will bear
[33:56] him a son the knowing that will bear
[34:00] fruits we
[34:02] together let's just move on a little bit
[34:07] now I like what Philippians Paul says in
[34:10] the Philippians in the book of
[34:11] Philippians he
[34:14] says
[34:17] sorry what we read he said that I may
[34:20] know him and the power of his
[34:22] resurrection because you see no man ever
[34:26] prophesied his own death and then he die
[34:30] he told us first that I'm going to rise
[34:32] and then he rise for real no one only
[34:36] Jesus could do that so there's power in
[34:38] there the power of his resurrection so
[34:42] let's just look at this little subject
[34:43] because tonight is prayer meeting as
[34:45] brother Aran said I won't take long and
[34:48] hopefully we'll be we'll be done H in
[34:52] time I want to read for to bring you to
[34:54] your attention to what I call the middle
[34:57] cycle the middle you know a cycle the
[35:00] middle cycle
[35:01] anointing brother teaches us in the book
[35:04] of The Thinking men's filter that you
[35:08] know we know the three circles the soul
[35:12] the spirit and the the brother was
[35:15] preaching about it the other day and the
[35:17] outer body the body
[35:20] now he says in that book you know the
[35:24] devil or the Holy Ghost not the devil
[35:26] the Holy Ghost is is able to anoint you
[35:29] and you even on your your your spirit
[35:33] and you do things and you are you are a
[35:35] son of God I like brother Greg Greg
[35:37] preached here some time ago the old old
[35:40] church he said you know the sin question
[35:42] is settled there's no debate about who
[35:45] you are and who I am there's no debate
[35:48] about that you are a born son and
[35:50] daughter of God that is no question that
[35:52] is not a debate the issue is to know
[35:55] him the issue is to to know him in the
[35:58] power and the power of his resurrection
[36:01] that's the issue I'll show you so let's
[36:04] just take step by step he says you know
[36:06] the the the how that the spirit on the
[36:09] outside between the soul and the body
[36:12] can be absolutely Anointed with the Holy
[36:16] Ghost did you all understand that he he
[36:20] asked the congregation now to follow
[36:23] that to follow it up with the continuity
[36:25] of the message he was talking about the
[36:26] message that he preached a few days ago
[36:28] or a day before the god the God of this
[36:32] world and the anointed ones in this last
[36:33] day he says that outside that outside
[36:37] that middle circle first circle is the
[36:40] the human senses feel touch smell right
[36:44] the second circle is the spirit senses
[36:46] willpower you know we know those senses
[36:48] right he says there you can be anointed
[36:53] there and then you you think that you
[36:55] you are anointed in the inner Circle the
[36:58] very Inner Circle and you do things and
[37:00] you are a son of God when you are not
[37:03] yet there you know that I'm not here to
[37:06] judge you right I'm just here to
[37:09] encourage you to remind you that it
[37:12] doesn't stop at
[37:15] sanctification it does it doesn't stop
[37:17] at
[37:18] justification no it goes to the Inner
[37:21] Circle to the inside and that's what me
[37:24] and you has to Avail ourselves and until
[37:28] God absorbs Us in the Inner Circle and
[37:31] he he he adopts us we will see let me
[37:33] not go ahead of myself you understand so
[37:36] so so so so it's very dangerous that's
[37:38] not what we want in the the end results
[37:40] brother Ben what we want is that the
[37:42] Holy Ghost can go deeper to the
[37:46] heart of your of your being in the
[37:50] soul then then you you you know him
[37:54] because you and him are one you think
[37:56] the same thoughts you act the same way
[37:59] so wonderful I look at you and we are we
[38:02] live life outside here I see people
[38:04] brothers and sisters are acting the same
[38:07] I say ah Lord thank you for confirming
[38:09] because people who are the same you see
[38:12] them that they think the same if you've
[38:16] got spiritual eyes you see that they act
[38:18] the same they behave the same you can
[38:21] see that this one ah this is my brother
[38:24] or my sister because you don't you don't
[38:28] search them and investigate them amen
[38:32] amen so let's just go to the next
[38:36] quotation I I put my own title subtitles
[38:40] I say here adoption fulfills knowing him
[38:45] your adoption it fulfills is the
[38:48] manifestation of actually knowing him
[38:50] what do I mean by that what I mean is
[38:53] that H I'll read for
[38:56] you uh brother Brenham says in this
[38:58] spoken word called
[39:01] um everlasting life and how to receive
[39:04] it he
[39:07] says h and a man in the Old Testament
[39:11] when he had a son born into his house
[39:13] you know the story he you know the
[39:15] process of adoption right he do you know
[39:19] it yes I can tell you now the process of
[39:23] adoption listen to the to the man of God
[39:24] here he says he was he was a he says um
[39:28] let me start again sorry and a man in
[39:31] the Old Testament when he had a son born
[39:33] in his house he was a son when he was
[39:36] born this son right but but there was a
[39:40] choor raised that that child until they
[39:43] come to a certain age right then if this
[39:47] chor was brought with the way to the
[39:49] father that the child was worthy and all
[39:53] and all right and everything now it had
[39:56] he was he was the
[39:58] he was then adopted into the
[40:02] family you are part of the
[40:04] family no question about that but you
[40:07] are coming to a point of
[40:09] adoption where your sick nature and
[40:12] God's sick nature is the same your will
[40:15] and God's will is the same your thoughts
[40:18] you remember the Lord said my thoughts
[40:20] are not your thoughts so you come to the
[40:23] point where now your thoughts are the
[40:25] same thoughts with God's thoughts you
[40:27] think the same way that God thinks about
[40:29] his children you think the same way that
[40:32] God thinks about his weight you think
[40:35] the same When God says I feel I want to
[40:37] be praised you praise him he comes to
[40:39] you to praise him because that is God's
[40:42] thoughts are we together
[40:45] so this young man but if he was the
[40:49] prophet says here he was adopted into
[40:51] the family but if he wasn't He Still
[40:55] Remains a son
[40:57] but he wasn't
[40:59] adopted so it's very important brothers
[41:01] and sisters to make sure that the Lord
[41:07] adopts you are adopted in the family and
[41:09] by the way that is all his work not much
[41:12] about what me and you can do all what me
[41:15] and you can do is to surrender total
[41:17] obedience and total surrender to him
[41:20] with
[41:22] everything then you wait and
[41:25] see amen
[41:28] God adopted his own
[41:31] son let me just back check a bit and
[41:34] then he's adopted in the family it means
[41:36] that now H meant just the same as his
[41:39] daddy and then this boy sign nature on
[41:42] the check meant just as same as his
[41:44] daddy just the same for he was adopted
[41:47] in full Fellowship into the family amen
[41:50] so God adopted his own son when he took
[41:53] him
[41:54] up took Peter James and John as
[41:58] Witnesses amen and I wrote it reminded
[42:01] me of justification sanctification and
[42:03] baptismal of the Holy Spirit and the
[42:05] Bible says there's three Witnesses even
[42:07] here on Earth water blood and the spirit
[42:10] can you see that the pattern can you see
[42:13] you get baptized wash through the blood
[42:16] you forgiven your sins and everything
[42:18] you're in then you get
[42:21] baptized that is why even as human
[42:23] beings we've got three circles outer
[42:26] middle IM
[42:28] inside because the water also washes
[42:30] outside isn't it so it
[42:33] correspond in the mouth of two or two
[42:35] witnesses okay I'll jump this part I'll
[42:38] jump this part because I want to make
[42:39] sure tonight
[42:41] that I I I don't I don't go over the
[42:45] time let's get to the next quotation
[42:47] here you need the
[42:50] soulmate you need someone heart to heart
[42:53] you know husband and wife
[42:57] they've got a
[42:59] Ministry they to a point where you know
[43:01] their hearts they aligned their minds
[43:04] everything when they get into that inner
[43:06] chamber in that inner bedroom they you
[43:09] know the their thinking is the same
[43:11] nowadays children can manipulate mother
[43:13] and father and and say oh Father and
[43:16] just they they analyze the strong strong
[43:18] strong points of the father and of the
[43:20] mother and they see who's lenient on
[43:22] what area and they play around but if we
[43:24] are aligned I already know know when you
[43:27] come to me what mama would have told you
[43:29] that's right or when you go to to death
[43:32] you already Mama already you know you go
[43:34] to Mama or you go to De the both of them
[43:37] give you the same answer but the key is
[43:39] not just that the key is to be even
[43:41] spiritually aligned together because
[43:44] that's how us and Christ ought to be we
[43:47] are like that amen you need to have that
[43:51] soulmate who is our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:54] inside your soul not Spirit mate not
[43:57] flesh
[43:58] made amen and he says here in The
[44:01] Invisible Union of the Bride he says and
[44:03] and that's my message to you Church you
[44:08] that's the that's a union a spiritual
[44:10] union by the
[44:11] word that you are dead to this old
[44:15] husbands you are born a new don't try to
[44:19] dig him up he's
[44:20] dead if you are a born again Christian
[44:25] that little gam that was predestinated
[44:27] to you is word coming on word amen wait
[44:32] on word wa on word wait on word come
[44:35] into full St of Christ that's right so
[44:39] he can come get his bride now we are

[44:45] coming of the Lord once we get
[44:49] there precept upon precept word upon
[44:52] word then we we are ready for his coming
[44:55] we we are just ready
[44:58] we we will know that now we are going is
[45:00] our time to go now because he will also
[45:03] be knowing the same thing that is ready
[45:05] they are ready now to come home amen
[45:10] that Union must take place while we are
[45:12] here it must take place while we are
[45:15] here because we cannot you cannot
[45:18] Rapture without being in the
[45:21] union already James and Tiana blessing
[45:25] and and and Mimi they already in a union
[45:29] what is left is only the manifestation
[45:31] of the marriage the the what you call
[45:33] your official but brother says the
[45:36] moment you engaged to her you are as
[45:37] good as
[45:39] married because we are still living in
[45:41] flesh we we just formalize things but
[45:43] they are already husband and wife
[45:45] they're just waiting for the pastor to
[45:47] pronounce you see sorry to give you an
[45:50] example with you my children but you
[45:51] understand it by now you understand me
[45:55] but I just wanted to give that example
[45:56] that me and you and the bride we are
[46:01] already taken up by him all what we are
[46:04] waiting for is to go to the honeymoon so
[46:07] do not being a Son of God predestinated
[46:11] born in the family do not let him down
[46:14] by being because by by by remaining
[46:17] behind or by manifesting the fruits that
[46:20] are not what you have been born
[46:22] into I I hope you understand me are we
[46:26] together
[46:27] I hope you see it all believers that
[46:30] comes through the blood into the body of
[46:32] Jesus Christ worship God through the
[46:33] shed blood and Jes of Jesus Christ in
[46:36] line they are positionally
[46:39] placed in
[46:41] Christ you
[46:43] see how do we get in what wish we had
[46:47] time I wish we had time for it about six
[46:49] more minutes look how do we get into
[46:52] Christ by one
[46:55] Spirit now if
[46:57] one Fellowship no no no the the first
[47:00] thing the first thing thing comes first
[47:04] by one Church he's putting a question
[47:06] mark by one Church obviously no by one
[47:09] letter no but by one Creed no by by but
[47:15] by one Spirit we are all baptized into
[47:18] the
[47:19] body not by water not by power not by
[47:24] might by but by my spirit say the Lord
[47:27] one Spirit we are baptized what by the
[47:31] spirit where does the spirit say where
[47:34] is life in the blood coming through the
[47:37] blood of Christ so you see it's a
[47:39] process it's a process water blood
[47:43] baptism in the Inner Circle in the inner
[47:45] Inner Circle where your affections your
[47:48] thought because sometimes okay let me
[47:51] leave that one I'll leave that
[47:54] one let me talk to you about being POS
[47:56] positionally placed then we
[48:00] close now positional placement is that
[48:03] now you are taking your rightful
[48:06] position someone may ask our brother po
[48:10] do you mean that when I was born in the
[48:12] family or when Jesus was born on Earth
[48:15] he was not the Son of God he
[48:17] was but even when he was baptized he was
[48:21] already a Son of God and the Spirit came
[48:23] as the dove but there was a time when he
[48:26] went to the mountain God brought him
[48:28] there Peter James and John were there as
[48:30] Witnesses and he was
[48:33] adopted am I teaching too much Doctrine
[48:37] tonight positionally placed they don't
[48:39] know what they are he's talking about
[48:41] people out in the world you are Sons and
[48:44] Daughters of God and a lot of times you
[48:46] are looking for something great to come
[48:49] but you already got you already got that
[48:52] the greatest can be given you now we are
[48:56] the sons of God I like to say and
[48:58] daughters not we will be we are now
[49:04] now right now we are daughters and sons
[49:07] of we right now that's where you should
[49:10] me and you are do you believe that the
[49:13] enemy must not give you the thoughts of
[49:15] doubting that ah no no you believe it
[49:20] it's like that you doubt it is not like
[49:25] that amen
[49:28] now and we are seated together in
[49:31] Heavenly places the scripture does not
[49:33] say we are going to be seated
[49:36] together it says we are already seated I
[49:40] wanted to preach the same one brother
[49:43] Ben where I was going to talk about
[49:46] access to Heaven life you know living in
[49:51] heaven but here on Earth I wanted to
[49:53] that was just on my heart but the Lord
[49:55] just I don't know what happened it was
[49:58] so much on my heart to talk to you about
[50:01] being in heaven while on Earth because
[50:04] people are already in Hell while on
[50:07] Earth so living in heaven while on Earth
[50:10] I don't want to to die you allow me just
[50:12] to take a little
[50:14] Loop you know to to live like a king and
[50:18] a queen here on Earth despite all the
[50:21] challenges of the devil but when you
[50:23] want to call Heaven you don't even need
[50:25] air time you you access heaven and
[50:28] because you are a son and a daughter of
[50:29] God you are you already seated you don't
[50:32] conduct yourself like a a disillusioned
[50:37] desperately hopeless person you are a
[50:40] son of God the suffering that you are
[50:43] going through they just like joy to you
[50:47] because they bring Glory and Honor I
[50:49] don't know brother AR how many of us
[50:52] when we go through hard painful time can
[50:55] say glory to God God thank you Lord
[50:58] bring it on because you will take me
[51:00] through we need if we come to that
[51:05] point they say in English it's easier
[51:07] said than
[51:08] done but I say to
[51:12] you it's easier to believe than and to
[51:16] be done it gets what what how can I put
[51:18] it if you believe it it's easy you
[51:22] believe it is it happens as you believe
[51:24] it because God said it you see God is
[51:27] not a
[51:28] liar God we were singing beautiful songs
[51:30] here I'm not sure how many of us when we
[51:33] sing those song do we really internalize
[51:35] them you read through them and you say
[51:37] wow wow that was the real inspiration
[51:40] when those songs they talking about you
[51:42] and they're talking about me those songs
[51:45] are real the Bible is so real that the
[51:50] word of God everything that is said in
[51:51] here is a promise to you so powerful it
[51:54] is God is so big
[51:57] that our mind and our ideas cannot
[51:59] imagine him so once you get to the point
[52:02] of believing him fully in his word you
[52:04] realize that ah up for me until Paul
[52:07] said you know what for me to live is
[52:09] Christ and to die is gain I don't lose
[52:11] in this battle I'm not I'm not losing
[52:14] because you are a son of God when when
[52:17] you go through that heavy heavy heavy
[52:21] moment and you know what your wife just
[52:23] see you smiling or your husband say what
[52:26] how can so no you know what we are the
[52:29] winners and that frustrates the
[52:33] devil heavy because you confessing the
[52:38] word of God and God is not I put a
[52:41] status today it blessed me so much he
[52:42] says God is not a
[52:44] man that he should
[52:47] lie he's not in the book of I think is
[52:49] numbers 23 he's not a man God what he
[52:52] said about you will happen despite your
[52:56] you are you are failures or anything
[52:58] that is why he made think if I was in
[53:00] the corporate you know in the business
[53:03] environment I would say he has put
[53:05] systems in place for you to make for for
[53:09] his word to be fulfilled what we are
[53:11] doing here tonight coming to church is
[53:14] part of the process of God for me and
[53:16] you to bring the the full manifestation
[53:19] of what he
[53:21] said because he saw us even sitting here
[53:23] in this church
[53:24] tonight so
[53:27] we better than believe it because
[53:29] there's no going back you are the Son of
[53:30] God already so you can't help it even a
[53:34] man called called A
[53:36] Jonah he
[53:37] tried but he once born a prophet you are
[53:40] a prophet of God God can change his word
[53:43] once a Son of God you are a son of God
[53:46] so you if he says you will go through
[53:47] here you will go through here why you
[53:50] are going to
[53:52] cry you better just laugh and smile them
[53:55] because you are you I can't say you are
[53:58] stuck with him you are his son so you
[54:01] better me and you come the way that he
[54:05] said the way that he said he will bring
[54:07] us because in the first place we can't
[54:08] bring us ourselves through he will pull
[54:11] you through and see you
[54:14] through right are we together brothers
[54:17] and sisters do we believe it let's read
[54:20] let's read uh one more about being
[54:22] positionally placed um from Israel and
[54:25] the church
[54:27] part two now we are the sons of
[54:31] God when now tomorrow night no right now
[54:35] we are the sons of God did I read this
[54:37] one oh no no I didn't read this one so
[54:40] this is repeating the one I read earlier
[54:42] was from expectations so now this one
[54:45] comes from the spoken of Israel and the
[54:47] church now now we are the sons of God
[54:50] now we are seated together in Heavenly
[54:52] places right now now when now now we
[54:56] have eternal life will you get eternal
[54:59] life when you die brother bham they're
[55:02] asking him he says no I have it
[55:07] now I now possess
[55:12] it how Jesus Christ said so that said
[55:15] the
[55:17] Lord so it's not a time for me and you
[55:20] to question is a time for me and you to
[55:23] make sure that our
[55:25] salvation is
[55:27] sure and we we we we are in the
[55:30] knowledge of him knowing him not just
[55:33] theoretically knowing him in the way
[55:37] husband and wife will know one another
[55:40] spiritually that it's like that exactly
[55:41] it's intimately like
[55:43] that amen because you are his wife

[55:51] quotation and then we are going to
[55:53] pray I call this subtitle the Inner Room
[55:57] knowing him the Inner Room knowing him
[56:01] then they come into the second Veil that
[56:04] was that was where M where where Martin
[56:06] Luther preached
[56:07] justification Wesley preached
[56:09] sanctification the second
[56:12] Veil where the altar Sanctified the
[56:14] vessels the third room house first we
[56:18] where where you come into the kitchen
[56:20] you only live in a you only live in a
[56:22] three-bedroom house you say mine's got

[56:34] can leave in the kitchen living room and
[56:37] bedroom you eat in the kitchen you
[56:40] commune in the living room and then you
[56:42] rest in the
[56:45] bedroom in there when you know him is a
[56:48] you you are at his rest it is peace in
[56:52] other words nothing makes you panic
[56:54] nothing takes you by surprise because
[56:56] all what is happening now in your life
[56:59] around you has already been
[57:01] prophesied has already been told to
[57:04] you has already been said that we will
[57:07] see what we are seeing today you it was
[57:10] already been prophesied that you are
[57:12] going to live here and you are going to
[57:13] Rapture it's it's a done deal so there's
[57:16] no second thoughts that you should be
[57:18] thinking oh Lord I'm struggling so much
[57:20] I wonder if I will make it no no there's
[57:22] no discussion about that just get in
[57:25] know him amen
[57:29] amen that's where the church has come it
[57:32] it comes through Martin
[57:34] Luther just the just shall live by faith
[57:37] wly communion sanctification cleansing
[57:39] up and now we are in the baptism of the
[57:42] Holy Spirit I will give you the rest
[57:44] unto your soul I will give you the rest
[57:46] unto your soul he says when a man went
[57:49] into his inner Veil a second Veil and he
[57:51] was hid from the world the curtains
[57:53] dropped around him and when he he can
[57:57] lose what now when we can lose ourselves
[58:00] in Jesus Christ I don't care what your
[58:03] denomination is that them things don't
[58:06] bother you anymore because you have
[58:08] losed
[58:10] yourself you have losen yourself you
[58:13] know the Bible says if you lose your
[58:16] life you just lose him you just lose it
[58:19] and you just sit here on the edge you
[58:22] put yourself so vulnerable because you
[58:24] know that in his hands you'll never fail
[58:27] he will never fail he says if you do
[58:29] that you're going to and you
[58:34] fall that's what he's going to do you'll
[58:37] never you know the mother eagle goes top
[58:39] top top top of the sky and then he he
[58:42] takes his two children and then today
[58:45] the eagle has star at her nest they're
[58:47] going to fly she takes them
[58:50] up and the higher you go the colder it
[58:54] becomes and then he leaves them cuz he
[58:56] was holding them she leaves them there
[58:59] and not they have to fly one thing is
[59:03] very they won't touch the
[59:07] ground the only thing the eagle must do
[59:10] is to know that I am an eagle and I have
[59:13] to
[59:14] fly crying folding hands not praying
[59:19] looking at each other wrongly allowing
[59:21] the Devil want help
[59:24] you flying like Eagle cu the when you
[59:27] start flying you go higher you even see
[59:31] better huh the more the more the more
[59:35] someone draws a smaller Circle you draw
[59:37] a bigger Circle of Love cuz that's the
[59:41] thing about the brothers and sisters
[59:43] love is so powerful man love is so
[59:46] powerful that actually it doesn't see no
[59:49] no no no wrong love doesn't see no wrong
[59:52] it doesn't see no evil see you see if a
[59:56] Minister stands
[59:58] here he allow himself before God and he
[1:00:02] just lose himself and he just love the
[1:00:04] people and not have no pre preconceived
[1:00:07] ideas and thoughts and things he just
[1:00:09] love them and the people do the
[1:00:12] same you know what's going to happen an
[1:00:15] explosion is going to come the devil is
[1:00:17] going to be blown away with a motor bomb
[1:00:20] because he he cannot just he can't love
[1:00:23] so love is so strong that
[1:00:27] until the Bible said God is love he said
[1:00:29] God is love because he first loved me
[1:00:32] and you he first loved the world he is
[1:00:35] love he loves the
[1:00:37] unlovable huh isn't that wonderful so me
[1:00:41] and you must love the
[1:00:44] unlovable the dirty ones the dirty ones
[1:00:47] that when you pass they
[1:00:49] stink those ones you
[1:00:51] hug and take them to your
[1:00:54] house right
[1:00:59] forget about your brothers and sisters
[1:01:00] that one is not even a question about
[1:01:02] those ones out there that you think ha
[1:01:05] those ones and serve them
[1:01:08] food cuz in there there's a Son of God
[1:01:12] there's a daughter of there's your
[1:01:13] brother in there you can't see him with
[1:01:15] his eyes but there's your brother
[1:01:16] inside it's hard for this flesh but once
[1:01:19] you get
[1:01:22] insight why do you think Martin Luther
[1:01:24] was it Martin Luther who cut his jacket
[1:01:26] in
[1:01:27] half and give that man on the street
[1:01:31] sleeping s St Martin he did that walking
[1:01:35] on the street realize that this man is
[1:01:36] freezing on the street he took off his
[1:01:38] jacket cut it half with his sword and
[1:01:41] give this man on the
[1:01:46] street so I I spoke about losing
[1:01:52] yourself I'll finish up with this one
[1:01:56] brother go onto the inner Veil God is
[1:01:59] the light in there it always light the
[1:02:02] Shak Glory lit up that place and never
[1:02:05] did go out because the out the light on
[1:02:09] the middle

[1:02:18] it up and remove you know and and do
[1:02:21] this and that the light the light in the

[1:04:33] end and then he rode and he never fell
[1:04:37] but everybody who focus on the side on
[1:04:40] this left it's not like those people are
[1:04:42] not there or those problems are not
[1:04:44] there they are there and they'll always
[1:04:46] be there because we fight against our
[1:04:49] our our what do we call him our
[1:04:52] accuser he's there until the day we go
