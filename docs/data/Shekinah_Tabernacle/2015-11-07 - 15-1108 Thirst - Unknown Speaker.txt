to cry on your feet Lord and I want to wash your feet and I want to thank you for the biggest gift that you have given us and that is your love and grace oh Lord I love you so much amen Amen brother Donnie would you mind comeing share I'll just read a scripture um first in the book of in the book of heg amen the Bible says the glory of the L house shall be greater than of the former say the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace say the Lord of hosts the glory of this L house shall be greater than of the former say the Lord of hosts so um just the Lord is just pressed on my heart so heavy to just um say something that we've picked up and um maybe somebody's going through a tough time a trial the glory of the lat house is greater than that of the former um uh the flesh brother brenon refers to that as the former house and God is building a spiritual house so um I'll just read something that um brother Bram speaks of in the Hebrew series we've listened to it on um Wednesday and um during the week I've said it with a few people and um last night I just said it with a brother also and um uh you know it was just such an anointing uh that was after we've been having a lovely time at brother Isaac's place so it was really good and I just um you know the Lord has just pressed in my heart to just share it with u with the church this morning as well he's speaking speaking of this lady Rosella and he says and when Rosella was quoting the story to me so brother brandham I'm not going to relate everything but brother brandham was just before the pray the preaching some sometimes he would have he would have private interviews so brother Brandon would arrive early to church and people would come early and certain things were very sensitive um and brother brandham um over the years we've learned a lot of things in the message so some things you you you you don't come to the pulpit here in front and testify about it and say I need a pray the prayer for it it's private so um you have to see the deacons at the back you see the pastor it's very sensitive so you you shouldn't say that so so brother Bram has given us an order of how to do things so some things could be in your house could be in your family between you and your wife stuff that you've that you've carried over from a former day and the message is a complete new day you can't carry you can't carry anything over and when we were listening to the sermon brother brandham was referring to Paul so Paul was um trained by gel and then brother Bram said that God had to take him away for three years in the in the desert of Arabia to knock all the things that was not there were certain things that you that God want you to pull through from your former life there's things that he wants you to pull through but there's certain things he doesn't want you to pull through he doesn't want you to carry over into the message so so there were certain things that God had to hit out of out of Paul um same thing with Moses um for 40 Years brother brandham said he had to keep him in the desert and brother brandham says um God sand blasted Moses out of Moses so um Moses had a certain idea of how he could deliver the people of Israel because he heard a lot of of his mother saying that your birth was special you are special so we in the message you come here you you you you hear this you you realize you're a special people and we were we were relating it with Brother Andy yesterday and I also sent last night while I was just in prayer and um we were busy talking yesterday about where brother brandham says and brother Bram speaks a lot about it in Paul where Paul says um God has given me a Thorn In the Flesh lest I be exalted above the abundance of that Revelation so so this message it's an abundance of Revelation and and you you might be exalting yourself higher than what God want you to be and and Paul says in that scripture that God has given me a thorn in the flesh lest I be exalted above the measure of the abundance of the Revelation so we might not realize what we have um the message of the hour is something completely different I just want to read about Rosella so brother brand is relating to this so this was in a private interview but somehow brother brand comes out of the private interview and he relates this so certain things he never related but he relates about Rosella and rosala was quoting the story to me in the room a while ago I was just thinking that on that night she said something happened and how that said all down through her life when she be just a wholey alcoholic couldn't he says here couldn't know nothing no Alcoholic Anonymous whatever couldn't do anything four doctors give her up nothing could be done he says and how from that very moment when when she heard the word from that moment something taken place now she is not that batty eyed she says she's a lovely beautiful young woman of 33 years old and who pass for about 22 just how that God did for her what he did and how she looks he says different but I said Rosella before the foundation of the world Amen God ordained that moment so before the foundation of the world her Deliverance was ordained amen but but the message is that brother preach a sermon called Paradox so if if her Deliverance was for ordained that means the trial was also for ordained it's quite quite a a paradox so so you go through something and then he delivers you but for him to have been able to deliver you he would have had to predestinate or allow that that you're going through to happen before listen the quote says he told Rosella in the room when see and on another place brother BR first with how she was a dope adct she was heavy into dope drugs and stuff so he speaks of alcohol as well here and on the next page I just want to save time and he says this woman was a dope addict and God delivered her and he says I told her that your deliverance was for ordained by God before the foundation of the world so so and when and when brother the brandham says something he's a prophet he doesn't say it like you and me just because I read it somewhere he sees he goes he goes beyond time he's a prophet he travels Beyond time he stands right there when God made a decision I will give rosela this trial so he's different so by the grace of God we we are happy we are glad I just want to close with this um we were talking about something yesterday about the Rada in and this is just the minister will be preaching the pastor it's just something that God has placed on my heart which I just want to share with the church so the Rada in is a very prominent place a lot of things happen in the Rada in I'm going to read something so in a sermon titled the Rapture preach on December 4 1965 in Yuma Arizona this is brother brandham reminded the people of the prophecy for the West Coast now this is just a narrator this is a brother they just typed us up he says I remember just my last message now brother brandham is is is quoting from Brother bram's sermon I remember just my last message in California where I would I thought i' I'd given I'd never go back again he says sorry I'm just skipping here I thought I'd never go back again when I predicted Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean and thus sayeth the Lord it will she's she's done she's washed she's finished what an hour he says I don't know when but it will be sunk on December the 6 1965 in San Bernardino California as he preached the sermon modern evain events made clear by prophecy brother brandham made a statement as he was singing this song So under the anointing brother Brandon was singing the song so we were in a sermon once where a brother that was in that service and I'll tell you what happened under that anointing so a brother that was in the service when brother brandham said this made a statement while he's singing a Brother related it to another brother and that Brother related it to us once what happened under the anointing with brother Brenham so I'll I'll relate to you now what happened in the service there was a brother there and this brother went over to America to go preach and that brother told him what happened when brother brandham so I'll relate to you what happened here modern events are made clear by prophecy brother brandham made a statement as he sang the song so he's in the anointing he's singing the song nations are breaking israels are waking the signs that the prophets foretold the Gentile days numbered what Horus encumbered he says here what Horus encumbered and then in between the brother quotes now on the sermon the rep they do exactly the same thing so he's putting this on this so brother brandham is's singing the song and then he says the following words under the anointing what's her slide into the sea and he carries on sing return oh dispose to your own he says the day of redemption is near men's hearts are failing for fear Redemption is near then I'll read further brother brother sister it's a scary time this is Brother Bram still speaking in the sermon what's the things prophesied what's the things what's all the prophecies being fulfilled then we see he says here then we see what all this is about it's not a bun a streak of fanaticism he says God's confirming his words exactly exactly the rock he's smitten friends flee to it as quickly as you can he says you flee to it he says prophets is vindicating the day prophecy is vindicating the day that we are living in brother brandom was approached by various brothers who lived in California asking him what they should do so this brother takes that and he continues further so now after brother brandham preached the sermon so while brother Brandon was preaching the sermon the brother said that related to another brother he said he was in the sermon and brother brandham under the anointing when he was singing the song and while that that happened brother brandham became lame and then he and then he that's when he said that words when he said I see a sliding in the sea and they could see and brother bham came back again and then they said brother brandham did a profound thing that he's never done before he says they said brother brandham has never done it ever he said he was in the service brother Brenham under the anointing walked off after the service and then brother Brenham came back with his hat on his head and he walked out and he said and he waved yeah and he walked back and they said brother brandham never ever went back to Los Angeles he's never done it he came back and he it's finished and he walk back so this Brothers asked brother brandom what to do so that's why um it is a very sincere thing you know the message is something very sincere brother brandom what should we do while on a hunting trip he said to the group so they ask him privately on a hunting trip you've preached this what should we do he says here people this is what brother Brenham responded to them people will make fun of the destruction of the earthquake that will strike the West Coast they will make fun of what I said would happen all the movies all the jokes if you follow the things on on on the internet does this happen it's just another thing there's so many Earth Quakes what is why do you make this man something special there's nothing special because it's happening such a lot there's a lot of Earth You Know listen under this anointing brother brandham says so he saw 2014 2015 he saw that time Facebook wasn't there and he sees what's happening on Facebook he says people will make fun of what I said would happen thus sayth the Lord on the west coast of America but I want your brothers to know this that if you have any friends or relation in Los Angeles if I were you I'd get them out as quickly as possible as possible he says then he told then he told the story of how the angel of the Lord had told him that his wife sister maida would give birth to a little boy and that he would name him Joseph he said the same Angel of the Lord that told me that I would have a boy Joseph of Byer told me that Los Angeles would sink and slide into the Pacific Ocean as the result of an earthquake so something else happened just something else I want to read in this this brother is saying let's turn now to the state of unrest in which brother Billy Paul found himself concerning the conflicting prophecy over sister Florence Saran when the message in tongues had gone forth on April 2965 so what happened and we were speaking about it yesterday Brother Andy um was relating to some brothers yesterday the different camps that we have experience in the message what Brother David said on Sunday evening brother David um uh Dominic we've experienced that I've related a little bit to Brother Andy added a bit of humor so you'll experience so brother brandham made a prophecy about what will happen to sister sakaran in the service somebody comes under the anointing and speaks in tongues and somebody else interprets that is the order of scripture somebody else now look at this so buly Paul after the service two things happen brother bramman prophesy this later on happened in the service brother B Paul brother Billy Paul in his testimony he's walking so now right according to B Paul's testimony as brother bham and Bully were walking back to their hotel brother brandham perceived that something was troubling bully and he asked bully what's wrong oh nothing there bully replied after a few steps after a few steps brother Brenham asked again what's trouble you Paul well Daddy said bully you heard that message of and interpretation there so bully realized it followed scripture it was a a and so it's nothing wrong with it it followed scripture well Daddy said bully you heard that message of tongue and interpretation there so what replied brother Brenham but Dad you know you said that the angel of the Lord told you that see would die between 2 and 3 in the morning notice brother brenham's reply so typical of brother brandham he answered he answers and yet does not speak against the tongues and interpretation so he's very clever he's very wise wise as a serpent when we when you get a friend at work you do you always use a bit of wisdom you know so look at brother Brenham didn't want to pull them off and say they what well all I can say is Paul all I can say that the Lord has not told me any different from thus sayth the Lord that he will die between two and three so I I don't know obviously he knew but you know the morning of September 11 911 1965 brother brandham was at the Remada in in phix Phoenix Arizona right about to preach a sermon entitled God's power to transform it was at this time that I witnessed the answer to the question troubling brother Billy Paul so it took a while it just didn't come immediately it was at this time that I saw this right they answered it I was doing oh he says I was on the telephone hookup doing the telephone hookup brother Carl Williams and brother brandham were sitting in the head of the table when I received a phone call from Brother Richard Saran who informed me that his aunt sister Florence had died during the night I walked over and told Brother Brenham and brother call and brother call and brother brandham asked me to find out when she died so I went back and found Brother richen Richard who told me that she had died at 2:45 that morning I went back and told brother Brenham who replied that's exactly what the vision said amen so he he refers he refers let me just read this and then I'll close I will leave it up to you to decide whether the tongues and interpretations were of God or whether it was from someone's zealousness of an anointing that was not thus say the Lord the angel of God had told the prophet of God that she would die between 2: and 3: in the morning she died at 2:45 that morning obviously not that morning but sometime later the message in tongues and interpretation said so when the message of tongues and interpretation in the church came out it said that she would not die and then that's what troubled Billy and then that's obviously a lot of people were now is this a real Prophet you see so so in the message a lot of things will test your faith and why I think God just pressed it on my heart because um I was just talking to a brother during the night and it's our time but it was um was in South Africa and he was relating to me um just some testimonies of what I told him years back he's in the message now for 10 years and God guided me in a certain way to meet this person and then I said them word with him and he was baptized and he said to me brother Donnie I can just relate something to you that I'm doing with a lot of people people and I'm telling them that they should read the spoken word they should stick only with brother brandham because in the church under brother brenham's preaching somebody gets an anointing to speak in tongues and somebody interprets and sist he will not die it's while brother brandham is there brother brandham is not here so how much more can Satan use any person to deceive you so so so I think the safe thing for us is just to stick with brother brandham you know just just stick with brother brandham you'll be very safe that way um um we've seen a lot of things I don't want to mention it from here um I'm just glad that now the burden is a little bit off my heart it was quite heavy um just to maybe tell you that you know uh because brother brandham it's it's it's it's it's it's it's we we're not dealing with we say brother brandham but it's not brother brandham it's just the piece you know so it's actually God it was actually God so so I I can say a few things and read a few quotes and have an interpretation but brother bronnie brother Donnie he didn't say in the days of the voice of brother Donnie he said in the days of the voice of the seven Angel no matter how long I've been in a message no matter how or whatever no matter how much I know I know nothing you go back and you read brother brandham brother Donnie knows nothing I I know absolutely nothing a little few things we do we say the pastor is going to come up is preaching somebody says something we just we're just echoing and saying something and repeating a quote but tomorrow I can fall I was relating to my wife early this morning this can happen there was a trap set I was telling brother yesterday I was telling Brother Andy yesterday about this man zimi Sager that how he was sitting in front of a piano and the anointing dropped on him and he's never played piano before and he started playing the piano and his ministry of song Led many people to Jesus Christ and I watched the FBI documentary because they trapped him with a with a human it's three things brother Brenham says You must watch out for money human and popularity watch out for those three things more so if you're a minister and they trapped him with a middle one he was quite Rich millions and millions of songs all around the world Jimmy swager I watched the video of of of of the of the documentary when they trapped him with a female a prostitute Jimmy swager and the FBI in that documentary said this man was trapped it was before the time that we had close circuit TV cameras cctvs but they had a camera installed at a particular hotel to see him getting out of the car with this woman and that's how and it was set up the FBI when they did the investigation they found out he was set up by Christian people what does what happened so I said to my wife P um Jimmy swager did not have an angel but didn't they set the trap for brother Bram and when the two men walked in before they walked in the angel said to him they've got a trap set for you I don't have an angel so don't follow me tomorrow brother Donnie is going to fall then you go gone I don't have an angel a trap said and I will fall in the Trap before the trap came the angel walked into the room and said to brother R that's a trap so Jimmy swag F all I want to say we don't have Angels there was an angel that came and told Brother brandham there's a trap set for you they walked in brother brandham is calm he said the angel just visited me now and he said this and that people you know they repented and they came into the message those two people they said who brother he told us he said to us we're not going to have see I don't have we don't have Angels there's a trap set for you by the grace of God we stay humble we pray we ask the Lord but all I can say brothers and sisters the safest place for all of us is the message of the hour you know so just just to encourage you we are we are a young Church you're growing uh it's very safe for you to to to to to to hold on to everything that brother Bram says this brother in his testimony last night to me he said to me brother Donnie you know how many things I've gone through in this 10 years in the message you know how many things and every time when I came to you for an answer you said to me you never have an answer I you just told me go read the spoken word go read the spoken word that's all you told me he said to me brother Donnie that was the best advice you have ever given me you know so all I can tell people uh uh you know just by the grace of God this morning I've seen we've seen many things we've seen pastors I was relating I don't want to say those things many things happening and the safest thing is stick with brother brandham that's all I can tell you stick with him read the spoken words listen to the sermons read the spoken word that's all I can say you you you'll find later on why why it is very safe to do that and um I trust that it's it's just it's just um something on your heart and and I was praying this morning after the testimony and and I couldn't go to sleep and I I had to pray in my in my lounge there and and and the Lord just just just pressed very hard on me to share it with you so I trust that you you still love me but um you know it's just that um you know by the grace of God we we've had we've got the greatest thing here we've got that Mighty stone that came out of the mountains shouting Grace Grace that crush the image you know we have we have we have zabel's Vision we have all those great we've got the wheel in the middle of the wheel we you if I mean this two weeks I was just reading the small books um the prophets hegi zaniah all those prophets those prophecies it's all brother brandham it's all brother brandham it's all that they all speaking of this so just before the minister comes um I trust you you you you just go back to brother Bram it's the safest place you know our trials everything that we go through as he said to Rosella in the Hebrews book it's all predestinated you know it's all predestinated and when you then go back and you read brother bram's sermons you climb in to the unknown and you go back in past time and you get your strength while you're in that trial because you you are under that anointing that same anointing of the one that can transcend in time and walk back and he moves back in time he moves forward in time there is there's even a prophecy of this creature in the Book of Revelations and John spoke about this creature and he says this creature had eyes in the front of him he had eyes inside of him and he had eyes at the back of him and John saw this creature John saw this this this great anointing on this creature and John wanted to fall in front of this creature so the Bible speaks of creature but it symbols and this creature told him don't worship me I'm one of your fellow brothers I won't you know obviously who I'm talking about that creature was brother Brenham he could transcend move Beyond before time then he can speak of what's happening and he can move back you can move forward that was that creature so so brothers and sisters um I always tell people if you do not know who brother brandham is you don't know anything about a message you need to know who Moses is otherwise you will contest Moses the whole time you will find fault with Moses you will say you are you you're not the only one that's what will happen so so just just stick with brother brandham you know he's that he's that you there's hundreds and thousands of Prophecies of creatures and those those prophets they were under the anointing but but there's lots of things that we think will happen the Lord will make it happen it's already happened brother brandom was the veil that God used a lot of things happen under BR bram's Veil that people think is still going to happen so so um you know I just I just pray for me um you know um you know that I just be more sincere uh you know uh we just be more sincere um just stick with the message of the hour so amen I we sing one more song 203 nothing myen praise God I'm I'm going home I'm going home there is nothing holding me here I've c a glimpse Heavenly hope praise God I'm going home let's just sing it one more time yes Lord I'm I'm go

so just take them many if you want to take them all than one go take them more than one go and I'll just I'll just reorder more so they're all there as well and also um uh just as we turn to the word so uh I think a few of you know brother Richard Oliver had a couple of heart attacks yesterday he's been flowing down to Wellington Hospital uh his wife and some of the family have come down uh they don't know I haven't heard any more from that so let's just remember our brother you know pastors the church up there in Alam you know and there's always a lot of uncertainty at times like this where one day someone's healthy and strong next day they're in a hospital bed and you don't know what the Lord's going to do so let's just bow our heads in word of prayer and if you have a need just if if you want to lift it to the Lord as we pray gracious Heavenly Father we just want to tell you that we love you today Father that that we can say that we're going home Lord we know where we're from we

word and multiply the bread to us we pray father may we walk out full and rejoicing Lord for your goodness and father we love you and thank you for this opportunity to be here Lord we commit it into your hand hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I just like to read one scripture from uh from the book of uh St John in chapter 7 and I just want to I want to just go into a a a just a bit of a subject you know on it a a few times in and in some areas he he preached uh so so I want to preach on thirst thirst today and we know you you you the prophet preached thirsting for life he preached thirst I just want to take a few quotes from there as well but I just want to read some scriptures here so John chapter 7 and and ver 37-39 and it says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scriptures hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake key of the spirit that they that believe which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may have your seats so now I want to I want to speak on this and and and brother Brandon would pick up this one word thirst because we understand this the Christian life is all about meeting meeting a desire a thirst you know and you know in every soul and I was thinking especially as brother Dominic he was he was preaching there sharing the burdens of his of his heart and his experiences I I I begin to think and Ponder why do why do people begin off on the way and then they go off the way into things that are very very different to what the prophet laid out because we see that people may you know as brother Donnie said people may quote brother Bram they may put scriptures and quotes together but they end up with a picture that is very different to the picture that's been originally laid out by the prophet and I was wondering why this would be because for me when I heard this message The Thirst in my soul was quenched I became satisfied with the drink that I was drinking the fountain that I was drinking from and nothing else could satisfy that thirst but drinking from the fountain that's been opened up in this day so I was thinking why would people drink from this Fountain and then turn to another Fountain you know as Jeremiah he laid the complt in front of you know in front of Israel you know brother B would take that scripture and he' preach a sermon called broken system and God told Jeremiah that the people instead of drinking from this artisian well they had formed themselves systems and they were drinking from aist and aist is a man-made tank it's not it's not a nature you know it's not a nature but man has to physically build a tank and they drinking from that tank and so you know both hold water you know an artisian well has water in it so does a system but one is god-given one is man-made and so there's a very difference you know brother bam would say like a assist you can get bugs in there you get wiggle tails and all the stuff that's washed off the roof comes into the system you know there's still water in there but it's mixed with all this other stuff and so you know that was that was Israel's problem they had fashioned themselves systems to drink from and drinking from the pure word of God and living by the pure word of God and so I was wondering now why on Earth would people do that why would people make their own denominational system and I can say that even even when people you know put you know they they take this quote and they take this quote they take this scripture they take this scripture and I said the picture they end up with the conclusion is miles away from the from the conclusion that brother Brandon bought and the life that is produced is very different to the life that was on display in the prophet and it's because their thirst hasn't truly been quenched amen and I'll show this in the scripture if you like to turn with me to Revelations chapter 7 because there's two classes of people upon the Earth those that their thirst has been quenched and those that their thirst has not been quenched there's two groups and we see here Revelations chapter 7 John in this chapter he sees the 144,000 he sees the you know he sees the fullest virgin you know he sees the church that have come out of tribulation he doesn't the bride is not in this picture Okay so he so he's seeing two glasses of people and I'm not going to read the whole chapter but you see as as John he sees he sees the 144,000 and because he's a Jew he can identify them in their tribes so he knows these ones but then he comes down if we go to verse 12 he says so this is just um I'm just I'm just coming into the halfway through the chapter but but you go away and read it it says saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are th these which arrayed in white robes and whence came they and I said unto them sir thou knowest said John didn't understand who these were and he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb therefore are they Before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple and they that sth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither shall they thirst no more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall live lead them unto living Fountains of waters and God shall wipe wipe away all tears from their eyes so he read there in John chapter 7 he says come unto me ye that thirst and I will give I'll give you I'll give you a drink I'll give you something that can satisfy this thirst but then these people had not their thirst had not been quenched until after the white Throne judgment when they received eternal life so there's a group upon the Earth and you can see the apostles you see all the True Believer us down they had they had come to the fountain or the fountain had come to them they had drunken from that Fountain and their thirst had been quenched their thirst had been satisfied but there's another group here that believed in Jesus they preached the gospel I'd say some of them even quoted the message but their thirst had not truly been quenched in this life I tell there's a there's a fountain open where the thirst of Every Soul can be quenched in this life amen so there's two classes here and we see in Revelation so notice also in this chapter these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb so they had to they had to physically go and do it they had to give their lives in order to receive eternal life they had to do it you understand but then in Revelations 19 speaking of the Bride let us be glad and rejoice and and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and we're living in that season and to her was granted that she should be a Raiden fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints it's just granted to the bride am mean here was here was a prophet saying I just want to dress if this if the bride would just stand still enough I want to dress her in the word I want to dress her in the righteousness of saints so here was a man that was fully equipped amen the prophet was fully equipped to dress a people amen that they could go into the presence of God no condemnation no worry am I going to make it amen have I met the requirements God gave the requirements everything we have need of has been given in the message of the hour to dress us hallelujah that's why we can go on a Rapture into the presence of God because sin can't go into the presence of God condemnation can't go into the presence of God Amen only a sinless perfect people can go on a Rapture and God before he puts something honor people he gives them what they need to meet the requirement amen and that's why he sent he sent Malachi 4 upon the Earth he preached a pure word there's no man-made things mixed in that word the Revelation is perfect in that message and by receiving that a purifies everything out of us hallelujah that we can stand as pure as God is pure as sinless as God is sinless hallelujah that's what this message produces amen there's therefore no condemnation that them which are INR Christ and walk after the spirit Paul says there's no condemnation we can say we are one of them Hallelujah I trust you can say you're one of them amen so it's just granted to her that she should be ER raid in fine linen and you come a point in life I trust you've experienced where you say this message just fits me Hallelujah this word just fits me just right amen no doubt it's like you know Elisha with Elijah Elijah put his mantle upon Elisha but there was a bit of time where where Elisha had to be molded to fit the mantle it wasn't the mantle had to be re readjusted and changed it was the Elisha had to be adjusted that the mantle fitted him perfectly that the ministry of Elijah could continue and it's the same thing with us you know God doesn't change when there's a disaster comes along people say where is God why has he left us God didn't leave no one man leaves God Amen amen so they say oh this is God's fault no it's man's fault why cuz man chose to go in a certain direction because God built us with a thirst every every person has a thirst but there are people in this day that have that thirst quenched Hallelujah now he says this he says many times this is from the message thirst in 1965 and Tucson he says many times God gets us and tight Corners where we have to look up sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital or bed somewhere so we can look up to see where the great blessings of God comes from now the word I want to speak from tonight one word out of the Bible that is found in the second verse thirst the word of thirst I was looking in the dictionary when I was looking up this word I was I was thinking about a sermon one time pardon me I preached on thirsting afterlife and I took it out of the Psalms 2 when David said thy statutes I believe are more precious to me than life when I was looking and thinking about that word thirst so I looked up in the dictionary to see what it means and here's what Webster says it's a painful desire a painful when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you now it's not an unusual thing to thirst It's Not Unusual to have a painful desire for something thirst is a natural thing it's just simply something that God has given us that we could to give us a desire for something sometimes God has also has to um sometimes God has also has given you a control tower something that sits inside of you that controls these different desires and this thirst this control tower that sits in a man's heart is something that God give him to warn him of desires that's needful for him now there's two two different types of thirst there's a thirst physically and there is a thirst Also spiritually amen so there's two different types of thirst and but the thing is now with a thirst and I just I I also Googled what a thirst means and and this I'm not sure what dictionary but it says so so so so brother say so it's a painful desire it's a feeling of needing or wanting to drink something and it's due to a lack of liquid needed to sustain life this is what a thirst is what a thirst produces and so a thirst now we all have a thirst there's a spiritual thirst so I'm probably just going to spend time drinking this so there's a thirst that we have and now brother baram he he says in many places he says how dare someone take that thirst that God has given them and try to quench it with something else and so a thirst it's like a if you have a desire for a nice cool glass of water but then all all you have is a nice warm glass of Coke you will still drink the coke to try and quench The Thirst but it won't satisfy like the water amen and if you can't get to the water if your thirst is bad enough you'll take whatever you can to try and satisfy that thirst and people brother BR I I I'm not sure if it's quite or from a testimony maybe a qu he might said it somewhere he said now if someone's hungry enough they'll feed from the garbage Camp if they can't find real food and you and you'll find that with people they go to church they have a desire they have a thirst and they know that God is real and they'll go to a denomination because the Bible says there'd be a famine in this land and also says that young men and young women will not find the result not find the uh will not find what is needed I'll read it to you if we go to Amos 8 see this message is God and if you if you thirsted and you found and God found you and you've and and you've heard this message it satisfied you amen this message was made to satisfy your thirst you were made to receive this word amen and I'll guarantee you nothing else will satisfy you amen you can go feed you can go try some charismatic thing some Pentecostal thing you can go to some camp in the message even and it won't satisfy you until you come back to the Fountain amen you know people like the suiz me documentary look what happened to the guy eating the McDonald's amen and but when he went back to a healthy diet that his body was really crying for he became healthy again you take that into the spiritual side of things you say well I'm just looking for something new I say have you really drunk from the fountain amen have you really drunk from the fountain because if you've drunken from the fountain you say well this is the best thing ever and it is why would I look for something else amen if something's anchored in your soul this message came from Heaven it's not brother Brandon speaking but God speaking Amen brother Bram said in one place early on he says he says when the anointing comes I'm the voice of God to you and then he repeats he says this second time was under inspiration amen so so it wasn't him really saying that but was God actually saying tell the people that amen cuz he was said if you can get the people to believe you amen Moses you go read early in Exodus Moses had to get the people to believe him amen Amos 81 behold the day come sayith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a Famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of the hearing of the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the East and they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst amen he didn't say there'll be a famine for Bibles or famine for Christianity or teaching but hearing the word of God there'll be a famine amen and I can say by the authority of God's word we are living in that hour there is a famine but brother Brown preached a sermon spiritual food and du season and he went to Elijah when Elijah was taken there was a famine in the land but he was fed in a secret place and he's saying that is you he's saying we have spiritual food but there's a famine in the land that's why God told him stay at the Tabernacle and store up food store up food tap load after tape load store up food because he was looking now there's going to come a famine in lady OA but there's a source of strength there's a there's a fountain amen that's being established upon the Earth amen it's not the physical tape it's the voice behind the voice amen the voice behind the voice that we feed upon Hallelujah so now he's saying he's saying there's a famine but I'm going to store food up this is why when I think upon these things I treasure this word so much more cuz he says young men you think people who are the people most suited to travel not the young not the old it's the young men and the fair virgins that's the that's the people in the prime of their physical youth he's saying people who are built to travel will not find it amen that's why I say thank God it found me thank God this fitted me it was made for was sent for me Hallelujah I heard I heard over the convention I think brother Marcus maybe he said it even here our name is in the Bible Well you was in the Bible behold I send you Elijah the prophet I send you you're going to say well who's the you it's me Hallelujah and he sent him that I wouldn't perish in this in this desert this spiritual Wasteland that we find ourselves living in amen but you can only have that realization if you've really drunk if you spiritually really you say well I've heard the sermons and I've I've read the books just drink from it and and that's why I was mentioning the super siiz me documentary look at the effect it has the McDonald's had a bad effect on him good food would have a good effect on him you take that spiritually look at the effect that this message spiritually has upon you amen what one day I was walking in darkness amen I knew there was some Jesus somewhere in here as real but I had no idea where we were or no idea who I was just just oh born in New Zealand this is what new zealanders do you just go and do what you know but then one day the fountain found me and once I was spiritually dead but now I'm alive Hallelujah that's the best kind of diet Amen to actually make someone to pass from Death to life that's why look at and look what it does in our families amen you won't find I tell you what real believers you see real message homes where there love and husband knows his position wife knows her position the children come under that atmosphere of Love there in the home you won't find it anywhere else psychology can't can't give it to you Joel oin will sure not give it to you Dr Dobson sure can't give it to you amen any cares man a bookstore won't give it to you amen if you read those things filter it through the word for this hour whatever you do don't just swallow it up because there's they say Jesus in there you fil it through the message of the hour whatever you do amen but that minor book still won't give it to you this Fountain this fountain that quenches The Thirst of every man and woman and child who want to drink that is the only thing I've been I haven't been too many places but I've been to Papa New Guinea I've been to vanu I've seen churches around here in New Zealand different denominations I've been to Australia I've been into South African when I was young but to come and see Believers and it doesn't matter if they're from vanu or they're from Pap New Guinea or from South Africa or from going I went to Vancouver went to you know Cloverdale you know all any believers I found that produces the same quality hallu the same character Hallelujah the same and normally you see someone who's real trim and buff and all these things people say what are they taking what are they feeding on physically sometimes we should look at each other and say what are they feeding on what is this person eating spiritually I want what they're eating amen it goes beyond oh this Doctrine this Doctrine see what the word is producing amen the doctrine is just the bark on the tree to protect the life but if the tree is not drawing water out amen and expressing itself back to God that's just a dead tree amen hallelujah just drink amen so a thirst now a thirst is what everyone has now but you notice he says this and he careth for you in 1960 why do people do the things they do in the world why are they try why are they thirsting and trying to you know drink certain things it's because what people feed on or what people drink from it's they they go to that Source it's because they find comfort in that Source amen they find comfort and what they just like a cool cool glass of water when you drink it you actually are receiving this is comforting me amen he says this here he says and when they drink they try to drink it away just a few drinks and then it brings some more drinks and after a while they end up an alcoholic and sometimes to be popular they watch television and on the street and smoking the last thing a woman has done in the 20th century is when women started smoking cigarettes that's the greatest fifth columnist this nation's ever seen it breaks morals it's it sends these institutions out here full of insanity people it sends hospitals full of tubercular cancer cases and everything developing from it and yet they do it to get Comfort God gave us something to comfort us the holy Spirit God's comforter these things are only a substitute that'll finally lead to a place of rioting and cheating and stealing and doing things wrong so when you see someone in a condition that they shouldn't be in they are trying to find comfort in the things that they are doing so don't condemn them for what they're doing just tell them there's a better Fountain amen that won't lead you down that road there's a better way of living there's something that TR meets the satisfaction that you can drink from amen that you can truly draw comfort from the right thing not from the wrong thing and you see you see it in New Zealand here the World Cup the whole nation Drew Comfort because they were feeding you know you know Steiner had the slogan We believe We Believe oh what's happened now it's turned into a religion we believe and they lift up their their heroes in prayer basically amen and because they're feeding on that thing and because we won it it gave the whole nation Comfort the nation can rest easy because our our their Gods Not My Gods the only game I ever watched was in was in Fox no uh Levin McDonald's waiting to get food on there that's that's all I saw I can't remember even who was playing but anyway those people are drawing comfort from that thing you know I remember one of the last World Cups the the the the semifinal you know when we lost to France I was working in a kitchen at Uni and as we were you know and and the commentary was on the radio and as the final moment of drawing to a close you just feel like anger just come down on everyone and when we lost everyone was angry I never experienced it before in my life the whole nation became angry because they're trying to draw comfort from a victory and the Victory wasn't given amen but the thing is you can still hey I got nothing against sport but if it really affects you in that greater way you to look at what does it produce in me because if it produces a great thing in you that means you are feeding off it amen you're try to draw comfort from it but if you watch to say we won we lose a good game whatever more you move on then you're not drawing comfort from it you understand so people people are trying to draw they have a thirst and they're trying to draw it from all kinds of things but we understand that now when when Jesus Jesus in John chapter 14 he begins to you know you know those those those chapters there where where he begins to just speak to his disciples and speaks about his going away but he won't leave them comfortless I'll come to you and and this word now this word comfortless he says I'll not leave you comfortless but I will come to you because remember with a thirst when a thirst is quenched by something people identify with what they're feeding upon and they become they become identified amen you see people in All Black's jerseys and they and they watch game and every Super whatever you know they are drawing and they become identified well I have the shirt nothing wrong with the shirt I have the banner nothing wrong with the banner you know there's nothing wrong with rugby but people are are feeding upon it such a way that that the spirit that's in the game comes on them and they begin to feed off that thing and they're identified they're identified with Richie mcor and all these ones and that's why the whole nation you know you they had the celebration uh parades nothing wrong with the celebration parade hey there's a great achievement to win nothing I'm not taking away from them whatsoever but people were so caught up this one little girl was in the paper that she lost some signed uh shirt or something and she was inconsolable but then they found the shirt and they gave it back to she was so happy why because she was Iden I want I want those names written that I can identify myself with this you see because what you draw your what what your is satisfied with you become identified you see I used to love rock and roll music I became that was my identification I love computer games that became my identification I used to play all kinds of sports that became my identification you see Hollywood all these things because I was something in in me was feeding was feeding off these things you know when David said the Deep calls to the deep and brother baram you know that that hole that hole just that half of a um scripture in there the Deep gos to the deep that is this message in a nutshell amen that there's a deep calling but he says before there can be a deep in here there has to be a deep to respond there and if there's a longing for more of God there's more of God to have and if there's a Jesus Christ to know that means there has to be a Jesus Christ that's real in order to meet that desire hallelujah amen so if there's a longing in you I want to go you know I want to see Jesus not because I want to leave this world CU evil I just want to see him I want to see him as he is that means there's a there's a great white you know there's a great Throne from to be on Amen there's a Jesus to meet amen I want to go to the wedding supper I want to meet Paul and all these different ones and lift up Jesus Christ and worship with them it's because they're there waiting if there's a groaning you see this world's falling apart you want to go to be with him it's because there's a Paul said if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved there's one Eternal in the heavens waiting for you you already have an eternal theophany body waiting for you and that's the reason that there's a there's a thirst there's a thirst in the in The Believer is because there's an eternal body to step into should this one be dissolved and that's the reason it's not you know you brother B says you know one place you know sometimes people think they just stumble into a meeting they get gloriously saved and and it looks like it's just all Happ has it oh God planned it that way God God knew you know you know he says in one place you know there's like a whole big convention thousands of people only maybe one or two saved amen and God placed a burden on someone's heart and you know you know to to arrange the whole thing and put a burden on maybe the speaker to come and speak and you know he'd be there in prayer and you know all these things as just for a few Souls but it's because there's a deep that is calling to deep and that deep is dictating this is what I want achieved in time amen and that's the reason you you say well how am I going to make a Rapture if there's a deep if there's a deep call amen he says about brother and sister kid they were in their 80s when brother BR was talking about them you know and he said what would be their desire if we asked them and that's say be closer to God because there was a deep in them they wanted more of him and that transcends to me if if you really have a longing don't let the devil try and hush that longing whatever you do don't let him tell you well it's just CU your family does it or just because you know everyone's nice and this is why I come and all these things forget about that if there's something in you that wants God as because God is calling you and the reason he's calling you is because you have a body in the heavens that you must step into one of these days see Jesus said all that the father has given me will come why cuz there's the bodies there H Eternal in the heavens out of time already present amen all we have to do is hear the word and it just adds word upon word upon word like a baby being formed and eventually it comes into its M the inside you comes into its maturity and it matches what that body looks like the two line and you're out of here hallelujah that's why that's why we should you know he the word listen to the message I've only got 10 minutes in the car put it on for 10 minutes say Lord let me absorb it not in my head but in my heart let me absorb this word amen just relax and listen say Lord I'm going to enjoy hearing the prophet today and just enjoy it you say I didn't get too much out of it if you enjoy it'll come into your subconscious and that's where you want it you want it down here you don't want it up here because of it's up here it'll affect your life even in ways you can't imagine Hallelujah this word has transforming power in it and that's more than just a catchphrase that's a reality Hallelujah never forget remember this Fountain will produce what is meant to produce end time message the prophet says meets end time conditions all this what 50 years ago end time message meets end time conditions amen when brother Bram saw it a prophet sees things in its maturity but when it's there in time it's in its infancy amen that's why we you can see what you know what the world is doing the prophet spoke about it amen we're not staggering in darkness Hallelujah you even read first Thessalonians chapter 5 it's a continuation of 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 he says but children we're not of Darkness but we're of the light that that day should overcome us as a thief so Paul's saying you know perfectly well you're not going to be overcome you're not going to be Jesus is hey sure he's coming as a thief of the night remember that but he's coming for you and those that are looking for him he will come and take amen so so Paul you got to read it because the chapter and verse people put in after Paul wrote the letters amen so sometimes we read chapters we think now the thought's changing but many times it's a continuation of the same thing and so Paul he lays out the Rapture the divine order of the Rapture the prophet tells us and brother brah says that the shout is the message so the prophet's placing Us in the word this is where you are amen and now we become one with that word and now we're a living voice and then and then he after this he says but children you're not of Darkness amen Don't Be Afraid children don't if there's a deep in here there's a deep to respond amen if there's a longing you say Lord I want to I want to walk I want to really walk with you I want to sincerely walk with you all the days of my life is because there's a deep calling to a deep in the Scripture it says uh Paul says in Romans not one seeks after God not one is righteous you read early in Romans so there's not anything in our Humanity that wants God but there's a deep a gene seed of God he put in us before the foundation of the world Amen that is calling for expression brother SS crying out for expression and then before God found us we try and express ourselves and different things because there's a longing but then when the fountain came I trust when it came your way when this word came your way that was it amen I found I found my maker I found my God he found me Hallelujah sure sometimes there's a lot of wrestling we got to do amen you got to cast you got to this man must die Byam said the greatest enemy I have is William brandham the devil's already been defeated amen amen we have to we have to die too he says the greatest enemy I have is William brandham and he was a man he was a man who cast out thousands of devils and many times what would happen is those Devils he cast out in the meeting they would come to his hotel room and they would try and have a goard him amen he said the greatest enemy I have is William brandham that's why Paul said We Must Die daily amen We Must Die daily you got to lay yourself down because in our Humanity this flesh was not made to serve God this flesh was just made to contact God but it's through faith we worship God through revelation we worship God and this man sometimes I don't want to get up in the morning I don't feel like reading my Bible the flesh man I'm tired I'm busy I don't want to hear the message I'm busy I got to concentrate on something that's this man oh wasn't it always rejoicing on the mountain top not all the time you see you see the faith chapter they were destitute these are these are the Saints of the ages that will Marvel at them they were destitute they were in sheep skins and caves you're hungry Afflicted tormented of whom the world is not worthy and that is the Christian life but if there's a deep calling to the Deep you'll see this life is just a vapor amen and you'll recognize that this word is the only thing that can that can satisfy The Thirst amen now he says this word sorry comfortless as I was saying before what you feed on uh you become identified with he says I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you now this word comfortless in the Greek he said it means it means bereaved that is parentless comfortless or fatherless so he's saying I will not leave you as an orphan I'll not leave you fatherless I'll not leave you comfortless amen I won't leave you parentless but I will come to you see I'm not going to leave you as an orphan child with no identification amen but I'll be your father I'll be your family I'll be your I'll be I'll be the one who walks with you I'll be your identification that's what he's saying I'll not leave you comfortless Hallelujah you see my little girls every game they play this is the mommy this is the daddy and you're the baby why that because that's their family identification people find their you know so I'm identified with this family therefore I have stability you see that's why he saying I won't leave you comfortless I won't leave you fatherless I'll give you stability I'll give you identification amen so then we can see now when God God is saying here that he will not leave us see if we know and if I had a message book I'd hold it because to me remember the message reveals Christ in here that's what it doesn't it's not another testimony of Jesus Christ it reveals Jesus in here amen and that's why you say well all I need is the Bible no I'll just say it the Bible without the Bible I mean without the message how can you understand understand the word because then it comes down to well this is my opinion this is someone on the internet's opinion and all they are using is their mind amen but so that's why God sent a prophet to open the Bible to us that we could understand who Jesus is we could understand you know who else you know we can understand who we are in him we can understand the power of the blood we can understand where we are in history we can understand truly how the should be amen truly how you know truly how children should be in all these things and how church should be you know I heard I heard for some reason I found myself this is a long time ago I found myself on YouTube and a man was teaching from the Bible about the Book of Revelation and he saying that the two witnesses in Revelations chap 11 was the Old and New Testament and there were people just nodding saying well that's incredible and it is incredible because how did he get that but this these are sincere people I'm not taking away from their sincerity they want to know what does this say this word is for me I want to know and this is what they remember if there's a garbage can they'll feed from a garbage can nothing against the brother ministering what he's so you know you spend so how could how could people work out what this is without God sending a prophet upon the Earth to say this is what it all means and it's not just an intellectual understanding but our eyes you know Luke Luke chap 24 and their eyes became open amen that they understood that Jesus was walking with them along the way and that's why that's why now you know the word has come open that our eyes would become open that we understand where we're from and who we are amen what else this message you say well what else can tell you truly who you are and where you're going amen they might have different just just jigsaw pieces but it takes a prophet that Divine intelligence of God to put it all together I'm still talking about the fountain because if you recognize what you're feeding from you will get what it's sent to do because now if you say well it's just his opinion on things I'd rather take a man's opinion if you just think it's his opinion where when he said to brother bisc in the car the testimony of God coming down to the car and brother Bisal looked at him and and he said when that presence came into the G said he said it felt like my next breath would take me into eternity he looked at brother Bram he said it look and his bed was sticking out cuz they just been 10 odd days hunting had been shaving he looked at him and looked like a man that was near death and brother Brown said to him said 10,000 times 10,000 he has come to me it's always the same like I could die that's why when an angel came in the Bible says fear not and then they would they would give a they would they would quote in the word what was where the person was what they commissioned to do and what is about to happen so here was a man who had thousands times when the angel of the Lord was present will come and speak to his Prophet I'd rather take that man's opinion if you think it's just an opinion I'd take what he says very very seriously amen then just my opinion amen and so the reason now the reason all that was was done is that God was proving this is me speaking this is me doing these things that people could say you know people say this message is Vindicated I'd say it's over Vindicated Moses Moses went down into Egypt he did the uh you know he spoke to the elders he did the sign I think maybe once they said this is him we're we're out of here father Braham spent moses' Ministry saying the angel met me in the cave I was commissioned with two SS and he tried to explain it to all the people you know thousands of times he tried to explain it over and over again says look can't you you know early in the early in the ministry you can hear it he says he takes remember the first side he takes on by the hand and and there would be and there would be a certain pattern of dots or whatever on his hand and he could discern what the what the disease was and he say who can see that some people saw it he was trying to explain it over and over again and this was done because he God because the people in this in this in this world we live in are so slow to believe he he could have just done it like with Moses just once the pillar of fire could have just come down on the o High River as John the Baptist was sent to for run so your message will for run the second coming and that that really all was needed oh here he is he's been Vindicated here we go the Rapture is going to take place soon but God proved it over again around the world people didn't even speak English accurate down to the everything was correct he did it over and over again because God was saying this is me speaking this man cannot do no man can do these things over and over again and it never failed once and see he's saying this is the fountain amen these words coming out of his mouth this is the fountain speaking amen Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free many people that when I was at University I went around the different Christian groups and the sincere these are sincere young people and virtually whenever truth came up people would say well you can't really know truth today and and it and it broke my heart cuz here's young sincere people all they know is whatever Church they came out of but they want to serve God they say well you can't really know truth but Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free so God is obligated now to show where the truth is Amen to prove it and that's why the Vindication is so it's a scriptural Vindication and it's so important because you can say this man what he is speaking is the truth and you hear many times in the prayer line he say this is your name this is it true yeah it's true you can hear it on tape over and over again is it true it's true and then he came and preached a sermon the spirit of Truth and he relays most of that sermon is just hunting testimonies and then he says now that Spirit of Truth is here not saying it for batim but it's basically what he says then God comes down and proves what he is relating he says this is the spirit of Truth speaking amen see if you really you know some people with food they love to know how many calories there are how many you know they love to know all the more than the flavor but they love to know what it's made of the protein amount the calorie amount how it all comes together how long it takes to digest in the body they love to and then they appreciate what they eat more they say this is what this produces in my body wow yeah they get all excited about it you know if that is just in the natural what about about in the spiritual amen we say this this word this is what it produces this is what it contains amen he says now and I'm just going to wind down a bit he says but there's no scripture for that but when it comes to genuine unadulterated word of God confirmed by God it seems to even embarrass the other group on the radical side see there's an embarrassment about it but it's a reality to a man or woman boy or girl who really is genuine Christian when God makes the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you receive it there's something that settles within you that there's nothing takes its place when a man ever meets God not in some emotional workup some enthusiasm or some religious Doctrine some catechism or Creed or Dogma that he has accepted for a comfort for himself he's saying people use religion as a comfort but when he really comes to a place like Moses did on the back side of the desert walk up face to face with almighty God and you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and the promise of the hour there's something it does to you see you're not ashamed of it it does something to you what happens that thirst has been quenched amen you say well you say I'm still hungering for God there Comes A Time in life where The Thirst is quenched out all you want is more you understand that was me in my life when I when this fountain found me and I really surrendered all and I drank from this Fountain then that thirst was quenched but I wanted more of what I was drinking amen and so God is God is the same sorry I got to read this God is the same way Amen brother Bram says it's like a tree they drink water they just push out limbs but you got to drink more if you want to push out more you got to drink more than what you need amen because if you just eat or drink the same amount as what you need you don't grow so just drink and push out amen draw draw from the fountain I tell you friends there's people in this room that have been drinking from this fountain that if they did not drink from the fountain they would never be standing I guarantee I guarantee every one of you you walk with God long enough even even in my little seven eight years that if I did not drink from this Fountain I would never be standing here today amen I'd never be a Christian to if I wasn't drinking from this Fountain because there's a strength in the word that when we cannot go any further that strength will carry you through am mean when your Humanity fails that's when God steps in and and it's like training for battle you know soldiers they you know there's live fire exercises they're going to carry all the packs and do all these different things put on a grenade and a shovel and all these big packs and you know and they do that because they might need that In the Heat of battle they may need that training amen they may need that shovel to dig a dig a foxhole or whatever what whatever they're carrying you say why do I have to listen what's so important you might need it one day amen you might need it one day and there's a saying and I don't know who said it but there's a saying in times of peace prepare for war amen amen if you're having a time of peace prepare for war Hallelujah that when the Devil comes and comes on your case cuz he will amen you have the strength to withstand him amen amen now and let me tell you friend this is in thirst 65 I don't care how many churches you join how many names you put on which way you go or whether you're sprinkled baptized or what you are and until you meet that person Jesus Christ that's the only thing that'll really satisfy emotion won't do it you might jump up and down and shout as long as you want to or might run up and down the floor and you might speak in tongues as much as you want to and Them Things Are Holy and good I don't say I'm not saying anything against it but until you meet that person that satisfying portion amen that's something that takes every fiber in your body not by emotion but by satisfaction used to see a little sign if you're thirsty say PA this is advertising they used to be a little drink when I was uh when I was a boy called paff I remember coming down the road over from fishing I've been up on the pond old stagnant Waters and I was about starve to death and I seen a sign say if you're thirsty just say PA I started saying pa pa I got thirst here all the time see I just got I just got so I couldn't even spit after a while I was so thirsty well you see that won't do it there's nothing will satisfy it I don't care if you drink Cokes you can drink anything you want to with them sweetened bicarbonated Waters and so forth there's nothing that will satisfy The Thirst like a good cool cold stream of water that'll quench that thirst all these other sub things are substitutes and why would you want to take a substitute when there's a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that satisfies every fiber and longing in the human soul can stand right in the face of death excuse me like the great Apostle Paul said oh death where is your sting grave where is your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ that's the experience brother that satisfies that Holy hush or that Holy thirst that's in you it satisfies it you don't have to do anything else about it it cleanses the lips and there's also just people who live upon emotion some people say well we got a lot of that in our Pentecostal movement and they'll go in which is fine they'll pat their hands and play the music the music stops oh a bucket of water went over everything see now we do that we got in a habit of doing that uh it's become one of our customs let me tell you something when you're worshiping God in the spirit and the truth when it becomes accustom for you to do it because you think you ought to do it because you think that if you don't shout or jump up and down or dance with the music your neighbor might think you're backslid you're drinking from a stagnated stream right until it fills every fiber until the Holy Spirit itself's bubbling in you I don't care whether the music's playing whether they're playing Nearer My God to thee or whatever it is the holy spirit still ringing the glory bells in your heart it satisfies amen he says he says later in the Ser he says if you've got that thirst tonight to know more about God and to come closer to him if you'll just raise up your hand now while everyone's head's bowed that's what to come down he says pray for me oh God look at the hands out into the land where the broadcast is going now east north west and south and them in the rooms raise up your hands to the pastors wherever whatever is there that you desire something in you thirsting that Holy thirst don't set safy it oh you say brother BR my shout once I dance in the spirit don't don't take that wait till that satisfaction comes the satisfaction portion of the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in then these Joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing the spirit will come you won't have to do it by music you'll do it when you're going down the car I mean going down the road in your car you'll do it when you're sleeping uh sweeping the floor you'll do it when you're driving nails in the wall with your carpenter work where wherever you are that's joy unspeakable and full of glory amen hallelujah amen we have the fountain I'm just going to I'm just going to wind down but friends that's the reason people they go off to different things and because they've experienced maybe the supernatural power of God but they their thirst and their soul hasn't been quenched that's why he says all those things are good but don't put it on that wait till that full satisfaction comes in amen and then the joy Bells will ring wherever you are in life Hallelujah because he says it's that person you got to meet Jesus Christ and he's the satisfying portion amen when Ruth met Boaz uh I know I mentioned these things last Sunday but I just want to maybe expand it but when Ruth met Boaz and Boaz said stay in the field she knew exactly who he was amen she knew that he was the Mighty Man of wealth she knew that he was a near Kinsman to Naomi amen so she knew who was speaking to her if she just thought this is just a man who's got a field he wouldn't have really obeyed what he told her amen but because she knew who he was she obeyed what he said said stay in this field and the reason the reason that she had to stay in the field is that Boz told her my young men won't harm you you know you're not going to be abused in this place you're not going to find harm in this place so it was a protection for Ruth to stay in the field amen there's a reason it's not just it's not just to say well you're narrow-minded and keep people narrow minded there's a protection of staying in the word staying in the Vindicated word amen cuz one hey out of that field she receive life the staff of life was growing in that field during The Barley Harvest so she was living off what that field that she was in amen you make it spiritual friends the lord of the Harvest has come and you have found Grace in his sight remember unto her it was granted she didn't have to go through a tribulation and give her life I'm too I'm speak of the Bride andto her it was granted that she'd be a raid in fine linen it's just given Ruth just found herself in his good graces amen she just this is just how life seemed you know what a what a terrible life to go through the the first the first part of her life but that was ordained by God to get her into that field amen it's the same thing with you friends God has caus you to move to certain places and things to happen and that was all done that you had come to the fountain amen hallelujah and so Ruth knew this is Boaz speaking he's a man of great wealth and influence here and he's he's related to my mother-in-law family relation and she was the and he didn't maybe she didn't really understand at that time but she she be to realize later in the story that her being taken out of widowhood the only one that could undo her shame was that very man amen and that's why she stayed she stayed in the field Hallelujah she had a revelation you know you've seen a cow you've seen cows put their head through a fence and and and eat the grass all these things friends the grass is not always greener on the other side sometimes the cow gets stuck in the fence sometimes they eat something that they shouldn't be eating and they get sick and die amen and well you know in the you're in the sermon uh Serv this the time of the end one of the brothers had a vision of of him and brother bam hurting cattle and he said he said the cattle's actually the church they always try to go the easy way we got to get them out onto this harder way which is the right way so you if I say analogies like cows don't be offended but you see God God has ordained it such a way that's why Vindicated so strongly he says this is the field this is the field if I had a message book I hold it the same hand this is the field stay in the field stay in what God has Vindicated amen and it will satisfy the thirst and it will continue to satisfy your longing you say well I've got questions I don't know if I have it or not just walk with God look at what you have he that heareth my word who's done that and believeth on him that sent me who's done that shall not what go to the condemnation the great right Throne judgment but has passed from Death unto life I'm just going to read that turn with me to um I think it's John 5 or 4 let's just read this together sorry John right I'm in six five to thank you brother 524 now let's read this together let's read this together now very ver means absolutely absolutely okay he say well I don't know if I have it I don't know what's going on just walk with him and look at what the look at what this message has done to your life look at what it's done he said okay let's let's read this together verely verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but is passed from Death unto life this scripture is a bride scripture because that condemnation is a great great way throw in judgment amen he that heareth my word have you heard it have you heard it in here something in you something said yes amen and Believe on him that sent me amen you don't just you don't just believe in the prophet you believe in the one speaking through the prophet has one has Everlasting what life already in them and shall not come to the condemnation that means you go the Rapture and has passed from Death under life amen that's it brother ra says in the breach message Brother Joseph brought it out in the um in the in the convention he says the breach how do you know you're redeemed because you no longer want your own will amen that's how you remember human humans have will I want to I want to eat this I want to drink from this I want to do this but then you cast that will down when you die your own will is dead you don't have a desire your will was changed that you will to let God in remember God is a gentleman and your own selfish will was changed that you could open really open yourself and he can come and dwell in you then after that you don't want your own will anymore if you stay dead you don't want your own will anymore how do you know you're redeemed because you do not want your own will amen that is incredible man in his will has produced this entire this Earth the devil has has taken man's will and twisted it that man thinks I want all these things and it's a devil the it's a thirst for God that the devil is perverted and their will is now I want all these things but there's a people upon the Earth that they've come to the Fountain and their own will other things made to the eye look more more pleasant look at this little place that we're in hallelujah amen look at this little place we're in this is not a church compared to what we have you know so to the eye it may look better but the spiritual I sees the fountain is here not just here it's in our homes it's on our phones wherever it is it's the message is the fountain you understand it's God speaking but you know if our will has been surrendered to his will we don't want our own things anymore and the only way your will can truly be surrendered to his is because you've been redeemed amen I might just leave it there can we have some musicians to come Hallelujah who's drunk from the fountain Hallelujah who's drunk from the fountain amen who's been satisfied with the drink Hallelujah I found peace Hallelujah the only real peace I've ever found is in this word hallelujah amen don't let the devil ever try to rob you if he if you know if the devil's trying to put down your throat you're not one of them you're just part of this because your family whatever more you deny what he says amen I trust everyone's here because there's a longing in them I want to serve the Lord amen hallelujah you know Edith right who who I can't oh yeah no brother Marcus you know Edith right there in the wheelchair she was taken into bam Tabernacle many people were healed and people were raised from the dead shes in the meetings and God never touched her once Prophet prayed for all these things but she didn't let those things hinder her love for Jesus Christ amen because her will was not her will was surrendered to his The Thirst in her heart had been satisfied amen hallelujah see I'm going through some things I trust that thirst has been has been met Amen in this word in Jesus Christ himself hallelujah amen hallelujah let's stand shall we amen let's just shall we just sing as the dear pen for the water Brook amen sorry am me let's just sing this hallelujah amen remember the
