this fiery furnace but nevertheless if you don't do it will not bow down to your image amen hallelujah I'll not bow down to your image they walked a few feet further my looked like God was unconcerned about it and I can see the man with the spears the intense heat was just about to get them they were just about to suffocate Shadrach Meshach and Abednego kind of faintly like walking on hands tied behind them going right into the fiery furnace taking the last step of the way I can see them now where they just about let's dramatize this a little I can see them where they just about the one step from going into the fiery furnace the only person gets in a hurry as you and I God takes his time as long as he's promised it that's good enough all right I can see them right up there almost ready to step into the fiery furnace then look it looks pretty bad for believers there they the old King sits well well we'll stop them them holy rollers around here we got it all under the situation under control as as soon as they hit that fiery furnace the rest of these guys will see that they'll know that I'm the boss around here but brother there's another boss sits yonder in heaven he knows all things let's turn now our faces our eyes towards him and see what he's doing you no all the time if there's anything going on down there there is something going to on up there too did you know that let's look I can see sitting him on this throne my his great robes hanging around them I look coming up coming up to his right here comes an angel you believe that's there's angels in heaven this is a great fellow come here and with this saw drawn his name is Gabriel he stood up there before the master bowed his head said master I've tried to obey you ever since you created me but have you looked down in Babylon this morning we've got three believers down there that absolutely absolutely are true genuine believers and they fixing to burn them up let me go down there I'll change that scene I believe he could have could have done that yes sir I can hear the masters say Gabriel you're true you've been a real angel you've done everything I've told you to do since I created you but put that sword back in the sheath I can't let you go Gabriel sheath the sword stood attention at his side that is just amazing picture here comes another angel what's his name is it one word you've got control

here with their prayers I'm watching I know when they got one more step to go I've been watching them all night long I can tell you because it's a man-sized job I'm going myself amen hallelujah I can see him rise from his throne his priestly garments drop around him walk out there to the edge of this big throne walks out there and over in there stands a big white Thunder head I can hear him say come here east wind west wind north and south amen everyone everything amazed him get under that Thunder head yonder and ride up side my throne I can see those winds get under that Thunder head big cloud come worrying before the throne he steps off on there reaches up gets a hold of the zigzag lightning and cracks it then there's winds are like horses brother he was one he was on his road down when they made their last step when he passed by the sea of life he pulled off a palm out down thee about the time they took their last step into the fiery furnace there was a fourth man in there one

morning the worship Herrmann not just this morning but every moment of every day that our lives would be a worship to the Lord Amen god bless you musicians thank you brother Amy good morning everyone great to have everyone here great to have sister Melissa's parents here god bless you feel at home amen god bless you I mean this just and I heard the stirrings made it home safe and sound so I praise the Lord there on this side of the world I mean so looking forward to catching up with him let's just go to Philemon there's only one Philemon and verse verse 4 like to take a thought on on a fictional faith I mean who loves the Lord this morning praise the Lord let's go to yes so the book of Philemon right the end of the you know at the end of the scripture not a not a but not a book that I guess really Minister on a lot but if we go to Philemon 4 and verses from 4 to 7 or say I mean when you are there all right so that's read and so the Apostle Paul speaking to Philemon he says I think I think my god making mention of the always in my prayers hearing of thy love and faith which thou has towards the Lord Jesus and toward All Saints that the communication of thy faith may become official by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the Saints are refreshed by the brother Amy unless bow eating a word of Prayer gracious Eternal Lord Jesus Oh Lord how we want to thank you lord we Lord our hearts Lord Chile is the heart pentas for the water Brooks so our souls long after you hear God we want to thank you Lord as David had such a desire to into your presence and we want to thank you we have that same kind of desire Lord just to be where you are Lord not to be far from you Allah but to be in your presence Lord that you can mold us and shape us into your image and Lord we want to thank you as we've gathered this morning I just pray father you take these words and Lord anoint Speaker in here Oh father we are I just asked Lord that your word would impact our lives you had your changes from glory to glory you just want to commit the service into your hands will we yield it up to you and father be at those who are away Lord those who are second body their God be their portion as well father may you grant it dear Lord take prevalence of the service Lord we surrendered into your hand in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you friends I just want to you discrete your name of Jesus Christ and I trust you feel welcome this morning I want to speak on a fictional faith notice now yeah because we want our faith to be effectual you know as as our faith can be ineffective we want it to be effective who are heavy fix your faith now your faith impacts the world around you I mean so notice here that the Apostle Paul is speaking here to Philemon and and and and we can see from his writings that Philemon is not an unbeliever he's not a even to make believer but this man is a believer he you know as the Apostle Paul is thanking the Lord for Philemon love and faith I mean and because of this we can sit in and port the Apostle Paul heard of his love and faith so so Philemon had a testimony Amen that he was a believer and his love and faith impacted those around him and we can if we just I'm just gonna wade through this and see how we go but I trust you know we could the devil can disable our faith where we can become ineffective we can still be a believable you still being sealed into the kingdom I mean still on our way to glory but we can be ineffective we can be disabled and this is what I want to speak against we want our faith to be official I mean so so when the Apostle Paul is saying that I heard of thy love and faith this word love that he speaks offers agape love so let's see it's a and and the word agape is a Greek Oh Christian term referring to the highest for of love charity it's the love of God for man and of man for God so it's not a it's not a brotherly love is not a feeling of love we'd call it which is you know brotherly love based on how you love treat me that's how I'll treat you in return you know so if you love me I'll love you and return that as a brotherly love or a filial love but God's love is not that way God's love is constant it doesn't change it doesn't diminish it doesn't even get greater I mean but as love has been fully expressed it's not based on it on our behavior not based on what we do Amen if he loved you he loved you right but it's now our our response that love is what matters I mean so you know you read in the book of you know you know because many people must understand the love of God and God's love is shown towards this believer by his election as brother Brown would say in this moon of church age this is now the Lord God Almighty says I know for he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block that is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they asked in Malachi 1 verses 1 to 3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you say at the Lord yet you say we're in hell we're in has they loved us was not Jacob and was not Esau Jacob's brother said the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering who thinks that Amen we know we we must understand the love of God amen so you think no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love I mean we think love is you like your children you want to keep them from all evil you want to keep them from all hardship you want to keep them from all suffering but that's not the love of God and I didn't expect the hallelujah you know but you know that is you know so many times you know it's such a battle we think does God really love us because we must understand his love his love has shown an election the proof of his love is continue on with the quote the proof of his love is election not met not no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with the purpose if he did not have a purpose that he would be the author of frustration or not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled amen who wants to be made perfect establish strengthen them settle hallelujah so after we have suffered a while that will be the case as job said he put strength in us job 23 6 the be power verse you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 5:8 2:9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left us Church a measure of suffering that they to by their faith in God while suffering for him would be come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1:2 and for my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations doing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but their patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing Amen so God if he chose me he chose me if I'm elected he loves me amen he said well I don't know if I'm elected I I'd come anyway hallelujah some people say well if I'm there I'm there if I'm not I'm not that's just unbelief Jesus did all of the Father Kay your has given me will come to me and all that country or no wise cast out so I just say here Lord I Here I am I'm coming home father holy that means he won't cast you out so Philemon was known for expressing the love of God and also for his faith I'm basically building a case because some people if you say oh of my faith got to be a fictional some people think well I've got the Holy Ghost therefore my faith is effectual oh no it depends on you right so so I'm wanting to build the case here with Philemon I'm basically trying to be a lawyer today here's my case what's your verdict it'll either be owe me or praise the Lord or maybe a mixture I don't know but see so Philemon was known for expressing the love of God and also for his faith now we understand that faith is a revelation brother Branham would sound first his and works as faith expressed he says now faith is a revelation from God now faith is a revelation that's where I want to stay for just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by His grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you never have faith it give to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon revelation a Baptist minister told me not long ago he said I I just cannot accept revelation I said then you cannot accept the Bible you cannot accept Christ because he is the revelation of God he's God's River he's God revealed in flesh therefore the whole church is built upon divine revelation jesus said - I believe was - Peter said what do does mean say I the Son of Man and he was talking to his disciples and some of them said you're Elias or Moses or one of the prophets in Jeremiah but he said who do you say he says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now the Roman Catholic Church is here speaking to Peter upon this rock I'll build my church the Protestants say he was building it upon himself now they could be right but to me both of them's wrong it was upon the spiritual revelation of who he was flesh and blood has not revealed this to you Peter but my father which is in heaven has revealed us to you and upon this rock the revelation of who he is upon the revelation he is the word in the hole upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it it showed the gates of Hell wood would be against it amen so therefore you're the whole our Christian walk is based upon Revelation it's not upon what we learn your jesus said very simply to Peter no one told you this it wasn't because it was the public opinion or maybe talk to the disciples or you know but God told you this my father shouldn't even revealed this to you that I am the Christ I mean it's the same thing with you and I the same question is always placed in front of the people who do you say this word is I mean who do you say it is is it just a healing ministry is it just to even a prophet but it's more than a prophet I'm it's more than a healing ministry amen but as the word become manifested it is Jesus Christ coming out of history revealing himself to you I mean you're gonna have that revelation if it's been revealed to you this is more than william branham speaking but it's God Himself speaking I mean then you're built upon the rock of revelation hollien you're built where the church is being built I mean you're part of that church hallelujah so Philemon had revelation so here's a man know isn't that wonderful wouldn't you want to have that kind of you know Philemon appears to be a modal believer in here's wouldn't you thank the Lord for the work he has done in your life if you are known by your love and faith when you say Lord you're working widely in me you brought me out of the pit and you've placed me on a rock and you've transformed my life because this is the testimony I have and it's not me it's you doing it in me wouldn't you rejoice amen but notice now Philemon verse 6 but Paul is desiring that the communication of his faith may become effectual I mean by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus now this word communication I trust you don't mind me go through some definitions but this word means partnership it means a participation it means a distribution and it means a it means a communion and then this word official it means to be active that means to be powerful it means to be operative so the Apostle Paul is acknowledging yes the Lord yes Philemon you have a yes you have the love of God yes you have revelation Philemon but I desire that the communication or the part the ship the distribution of your faith would become active it become powerful to become operative I mean it wouldn't be it wouldn't be disabled it wouldn't be neutral it wouldn't just sit there dormant but have been living and be manifest you'll be bubbling for holier that's what his desire was that his faith would be effectual who wants to fix your face hello he wants to really Lord Lord come come bubble out of me I mean that people would receive a culture and color it's not because of our ability it's God that would bubbles fall hallelujah for one another I mean for this this world is thirsty I mean spiritually it is dying is it there's a drought I mean but the but the believer hallelujah has an artesian well bubbling forth as it has an inexhaustible fountain I mean is in the believer hallelujah if Christ is in you you have the fountain in you but we need it to bubble forth and it what's the good having all the water in the world and it's not even being distributed amen hallelujah you take many parts of the world it can be raining a whole bunch in one part and it can be severe droughts in another part all they need is a big pot to transfer it and there wouldn't be a drought same thing with you and I they men so he sang him play in English Philemon I desire your life would have an impact it would change lives for the kingdom of God now the devil doesn't want us to be effective for the kingdom amen he wants to disable our walk so that even though we know the Lord we can end up totally ineffective I don't want to be that kind of way but it can happen spirit filled believers can be disabled crippled up and that's what the devil wants us to be brother Brent brother Brandon would say and why Christ speak as in 1963 see the preachers today seem to want to make their churches like some kind of modernistic Lodge of some sort membership and so forth they see the possibilities of maybe becoming a bishop or a general overseer or something like that if they will go along with the church forsaking the scriptures when it's laying right there before them were thoroughly a vindicated by the power of God and by the Living of God living in the people yet they don't want it they say we don't want to get mixed up with something like that that would take their fellowship card that would make did take the denominational order yet honest men like lot sitting down and Sodom knowing that that it's wrong see what do they do when they do that they paralyze the little faith that they did have it can't work I mean because that you know the Bible says that the that that the life in Sodom and Gomorrha vexed lots righteous soul he was righteous compared to Sodom and Gomorrah but a victim but it actually his faith became disabled by where he was living he didn't make an impact he didn't he didn't win anyone he didn't get them to turn their you know from their wicked ways yet though he set in the gate I mean so he was you know he was a mayor of the city he was in a place of power and authority but yet his life as Christian testimony had no impact whatsoever on on the people even his own sons and laws would laugh at him when he would speak them say look these angels have come I mean they're pulling us out of this place because God is gonna burn this burn this world I hear crackly something going on up here you know we were singing and the thing just turned on it seemed to be it had a lot I didn't touch anything by the way anyway you know so so that has his walk his testimony was totally know and if an ineffective I mean because it was paralyzed by where he was now Moses he said so but Moses he says his faith paralyzed the world I mean his faith paralyzed Egypt the greatest superpower in the day and one man with revelation of who God was of what God was doing gonna say paralyzed at all total Empire hallelujah that's how powerful his faith was and if that is faith under the blood of bulls and goats how much more the faith under the blood of Jesus Christ and where our people are looked up to be joint heirs with Christ hallelujah how much more that kind of faith he says either your faith will paralyze glamour or either glamour will paralyze your faith now you have to take one or the other and you see the Bible don't change God don't change he's the unchangeable God so either this world we talked about glamour this world will paralyze you oh you your faith will paralyze the world I want my faith to paralyze the world I want what Jesus died for to be fully manifested in my life I don't want to just scrape in by the skin of my teeth I want I want to be an overcomer holy because the overcomers said in his throne I mean that's how I want to be now let's go to 2nd Timothy and in verse 1 I want to show you another oh no I want to go through Timothy's here the Apostle Paul is as addressing something very specific would it be amazing for the messenger to write to you personally hallelujah and God's written to us personally amen hell yeah 2nd Timothy 1 and 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus 2 Timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from God the Father in Christ Jesus our Lord I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy when I call to remembrance the unfeigned which means sincere faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that is in thee also wherefore I put thee in remembrance too that thou stir up which means to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for God has not called us and it has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God now we know Timothy was a believer hello believers how we today I mean he was a believer and he was not only a but he was a spirit-filled believer that had a ministry gift so he was part of the fivefold ministry in his day he was a son in the faith of the Apostle Paul Holley he was raised under the tutelage of the Apostle Paul but yet the Apostle Paul was prompted by the Lord to write to him to encourage him to rekindle the gift of God in his life so something had happened to Timothy that was the devil was trying to disable the gift in his life that God could not anoint that gift and use it because we must understand everyone is gifted in this room it's not just a preacher the song leader the musician the deacon whoever it may be we're all gifted we've all been given a gift hallelujah and every gift complements together the whole bodies must function in unity I mean that God can manifest himself through a mini many membered body I mean so now there so now here as the devil has come against Timothy to try and disable the gift in his life hallelujah and then how does this come in I mean well you know disappointment comes and people come the devil comes against you hallelujah he would Timothy would have faced opposition he would have faced the same opposition appeal the Apostle Paul faced and it affected him in such a way that it that instead of letting God use the gift in his life because brother Graham says what's the greatest gift get yourself out of the way that God can come in and manifest himself however he wants to manifest himself I say Lord I want to get myself out the way that you can take the gift of faith whatever gift you have a man and God can use it hallelujah because we have to surrender I mean we cannot be effectual for the kingdom if we are not surrendered and he said but I gave my eyes the Lord many years ago but have you taken it back again I mean because of circumstance because of hardship because of trials because of misunderstandings or unforgiveness or resentment whatever it may be have you taken it back again amen they met just like brother Tim fruit said he's like sixty odd years old I guess he said at five years old I gave my heart to the Lord I never took her back hallelujah and that's how we should be I gave her half the law I never took it back I mean cuz if he has your heart if he has your desires your affections everything that you are then God could anoint the gift in your life and you can be official in the body wherever God has placed you to be I mean so the Apostle Paul is addressing this and you know he's he's addressing Timothy that the enemy though he's trying to disable the gift of disable the gift of God in his life ami but Timothy wouldn't allow it to happen hallelujah hey the devil doesn't want us to be effective do you think he was happy when when when the day of Pentecost happened and you know the church just was birth gloriously why do you think they you know you you know you read through the Gospels as says they wanted to stone Jesus and throw him down the cliff and all these things the apostles were with them why didn't they try and stone the apostles and throw them down cliffs and kill them because the life of God wasn't in them yet they're with the son of man they're walking with them they were believers but yet that same life wasn't in them but then when the day of Pentecost came that same God came and dwelt on them and God manifests himself through 120 and the gospel spread and then where'd the persecution go against the apostles workers God or where the sorry the devil always tries to snuff out the life of God and man that's why they were they were brought before the Sanhedrin and the council they were threatened don't preach in this name anymore don't do these things no more and they just said who are we going to serve are we going to please God or man you tell us they say we're just going to please God and they came together after that they had a prayer meeting God came down shook the house refilled them I mean wash that complex out of their life and now given god i'm boldness and they went out and preached again hallelujah that's why it's so important to have a pre-meeting the devil tries to come against you just get into the prince of god stand in his presence amen God can come and mold and change you hallelujah that's so important it's not about trying to work out the solution he is the solution I mean God is a solution hallelujah Amen so so that so Timothy he was told by told by the Apostle Paul he says Timothy I remember the sincere faith that was in your grandmother that was in your mother and now I believe that faith is in you that unfeigned means sincere how it genuine faith I mean I believe what I saw in them that's in you and I want you to remember I mean what when when the Lord went from being their testimony from their story I mean it went from being his grandmother stirring his mother's story then that same God of his grandmother and mother became his God I mean it became his testimony I mean that guy became living in Hamlin I mean Timothy I want you to remember the day when the wood became a life to you it was more than some Scrolls more than just someone preaching and been the same God became living in your life I want you to remember that day I want you to stir up that gift bring to remembrance what happened to you hallelujah and that's what we must do I mean the devil tries to come against us going back through your testimony stir up remembrance what he did I think those of God called you back there he's not gonna drop you here he's going to take you all the way hallelujah that's why you got to stir it up don't dwell on the negative don't dwell on the situation dwell on God Drella what he has done hallelujah because he called you to put you in the army put you on the frontlines hallelujah amen sorry Timothy stir up which means to rekindle the gift of God you got to reignite it how do you recognize a fire you put you put fuel on that fire amen you don't just take your photo of it you underst what through your photos look at that wonderful fire no you put fuel on it hallelujah that's how you rekindle the fire that's being burnt down you put fuel on it you may be blown a little bit get the embas going hallelujah and then the fires going again well that sounds very lovely how do we do that exactly it's more than just going through the motions of listening to the message coming to church reading the Bible but it's a sincere prayerful desire I mean because you can have walls up you can be disabled yet go through the motions yet outwardly look like you're doing the right thing but if you're a walled up on the inside I just don't want to get hurt no more I just don't want to you know I don't want to go through that again I just I barely survived it I don't want to go through it again hallelujah you gonna have a gumption Lord if I've got to go through that battle again I mean the Apostle Paul had a lot of hardship he was shipwrecked he was beaten he was robbed people wanted to kill him I mean he he said he fought the beast at Ephesus that wasn't animals that was religious spirits and people and but he said none of these things move me wholly because he was determined I mean after he met the Lord on the road to Damascus he said you know he just clave to that visitation hallelujah that God was with him the whole way down and nothing the devil could do could disable his faith hallelujah and if that was the if that was the beginning it'll be at the end the same way hallelujah amen so it's more than just going through the motions but two sincere prayerful desire Lord speak to my heart like you did at the beginning touch my heart with your word as I hear it I don't just want to hear it in here speak you know how he speaks you it just it just throws your soul hallelujah please never had that experience I mean you may be reading the scripture just anchors down you just have a jubilee you hear the message you just have a jubilee how do you may have heard it many times but just quickens Cheers I mean you begin to rejoice God comes down in the room hallelujah well you begin to pray hallelujah and he draws near and you know you're talking to the eternal one and he's not up in heaven some places in the room with you hallelujah that's putting wood on that's putting fuel on the fire hallelujah amen see brother BAM sit in the pillar of 553 sees the biggest trouble there is in the church today is a bunch of fear people always scared that's of the devil don't be scared be brave you don't have thee you've got nothing to be afraid about hallelujah brother Graham says in the revelation of Jesus Christ the church age book Christine cheese's she had shared this with me it's just blessed me so much is would you like an Old Testament type let's go back to the Garden of Eden when the first news came to glory that the son Adam had been lost at God send an angel then he seemed a son did he send another one like unto us no he came himself to redeem that lost son hallelujah God the Northern Trust his plan of salvation to another he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us unto himself we are saved by the blood of God the eternal God and dwells a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the Vail with it consider the sense that is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage into foul men of sin and then the loosing is perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth wish declares us righteous who is he that condemneth that is Christ that died Romans 8:33 34 there it is he his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now there is now no condemnation how can there be if there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has Lucius from sin we are free guiltless don't listen to men listen to the word you are loosed by the blood now don't get tied down again by traditions and creeds and organizations don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus Saves heals fills with the Holy Ghost and power you are God's free men loosed by his own blood if you will still hold to your faith to creeds and denominations that will certain by the evidence that you've lost your faith in the word holy is that we've been loosed by a perfect blood and that loosing is complete it's not a partial loosing I mean it's not just on a weekend or one day of the week I mean but if you're loosed if you're free you're free I mean the hem of the Sun is set free is free indeed I mean it's a perfect sacrifice is perfectly loose - I mean from the bondage of sin from the yoke of the devil hallelujah we're free amen but it all depends though if you have faith in the word holy then he's done it for you it's not by feeling now if you feel up or down left or right but if your face is on the Word of God irrespective of how you feel how your day is going how your weeks going how your years going but you better sink it in your soul Lord I take you at your word your word says I'm free I accept my freedom I accept my pardon and I'm walking in that Liberty hallelujah but at all as I said it all depends on what you believe about what the Lord has done for you that makes the difference hallelujah you know brother Brown says how long you say for as long as you believe it how long you an overcomer for as long as you believe it I mean if you believe you'll never overcome you never will overcome if you confess defeat you'll be defeated if you confess victory you will get victory hallelujah what what comes out of here means a whole much you know if you say there's nothing to come into church there'll be nothing to come into Church for you hallelujah but those are bubbling rejoicing how wonderful it has been his presence what happens they go into his presence hallelujah now as I sit on I'm at the end of Wednesday night we must cultivate a spiritual appetite for the word I just want to go into this I mean to cultivate a piece of ground takes effort and labor but the farmer who does so sees the potential and the ground and the seed and what he can produce from it amen you see a farmer I said well I believe I'm going to get a good crop this year and they put into action what they believe now let's go to the Song of Solomon chapter 4 because the scripture declares to us that we are a garden who knows that Song of Solomon 4 and 12 say I mean when you are there do you swipe left to do see here a garden and closed I mean we don't normally preach from the Song of Solomon but it's a love story I trust you see yourself in there Holly he's writing about me and her hallelujah glory amen a garden enclosed as my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed by plants are an orchid of pomegranates with pleasant fruits now camphor with with um spikenard spikenard and saffron calamus and and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices a fountain of gardens a well of living waters and streams from lebanon awake o north wind and come thou Rippon my garden that the spices are of my flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits see saying that we are a garden we are a garden if we're a garden things growing gardens very elementary things growing gardens but it depends what you allow to grow is what's going to grow you know if I you go look at my lawn there's not a lot of grass in there because I don't look after it you know but what's in there growth it has a life of itself there was one time there's a pile of leaves down the side of the house is just concrete and then in this pile leaves weeds were growing out of it because there's the right atmosphere for these weeds just to grow a little pile of leafs things will grow wherever it can find it'll grow now so so in order so now this is this is us remember I said we need to get the right we need to have the right spiritual walk for Kemp to be truly effective I mean I don't want just a camp experience this year I want just choice it's going to be a step higher we're gonna have a Jubilee we're gonna have a wonderful time but what I was before camp I don't want to go back to after him I want to be higher closer walk with God I mean after camp than now right that's that's why I want to be I don't just want to well you know I don't just want to Plateau you know we're living in an age where the believers and called the plateau you take you take under Luthor the message of justification the just shall live by faith that's as high as they could live and they lived in they overcame then Wesley came with sanctification ii wherever work of grace is as high as they could live and they didn't they overcame then the Pentecostal move that's as high as the people could live they were living higher than the Lutheran's but they still that's as high as they could go but now when the Son of man has revealed the book has come open every part of the land belongs to us that means we can't Plateau unless we choose to I mean but God doesn't want us bribed just a plateau he wants her to grow mature become all I come every day yes hallelujah so if that's the case you know I want to close to walk with God after camp then now I mean it's I'm I'm giving you tools how lid don't just put it up in your garage and come once a month maybe if you're lucky and use it use it every day amen so in order for a farmer to get the most out of his garden he must have the understanding of what he's to plant the type of soil he has how much water he needs what fertilizer to use and how to get rid of pests and weeds now I want to go to proverbs 24 sorry this is a bit of a Bible study but I just this is how does and proverbs 24 verse 30 it speaks of a slothful man who likes the book of Proverbs lujah I tell you you read a proverb there's thirty you know there's virtually a proverb for every day of the month you read it ponder it you'll find your life you'll find your life changing for the good I mean God condenses as truths does he not so you know there's many power even just in a in one one verse is many powerful things so let's go to proverbs 24 and 30 now I'm still talking about Philemon if you won't know where I'm going we haven't gone Horticultural you know only but proverbs 24 and 30 I went by the field of the slothful I mean say I mean when you are there and by the vineyard of a man void of understanding see someone who's lazy someone who doesn't have understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the Stonewall drove was broken down then I saw and I considered it well and looked upon it and received instruction so we have just read in the Song of Solomon that we are a garden and to me in this proverb that the state of this man's vineyard is a manifestation of the state of his soul see he's slothful he has no understanding and because he is he has this nature amen his garden as just thorns and needles and his and and and the walls broken down so what's growing in him just grows there's no cultivation there's no planting the rites Eden amen and then the wall is broken down now we read and I'm just going to jump to this one no maybe I'll just actually follow my notes for once you know you know mark 14 Jesus gives the parable of the sower and he says that they that the seed falls among thorns as those that hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in they choke the word and it becometh unfruitful so the word is sown it's received but the cares of life you know deceitfulness of riches the lust of other things then they enter in and we'd always grow quicker than the original thing you want right so so this person allows other things to be sown into their life and because they actually are trying to jump on to those things the Word of God cannot grow it's choked out it doesn't it doesn't come to maturity it doesn't produce what it's meant to produce but the thorns of this life choke it out this is someone void of understanding what because what happens is they don't have understanding that this this is mildly official if it's receiving to a heart of faith but the devil doesn't want the word to produce what it says it will produce you know God is not an instant God right it's here you know he says like in the book of Ephesians he says that that we we begin as babies tossed to and fro right but then we should grow to maturity to the image of the Son of Man right so we are all spiritually when we're birthed into the kingdom doesn't matter what age that maybe we're babies but God wants us to grow and he wants his word to grow in us amen sir but if we let the deceitfulness of riches lusts of other things entering it chokes the word why do you think we have so many distractions in this day because the devil doesn't want the bride to come to her maturity he wants to sow his thorns and his needles and as and as you know he wants his crowd our mind we're so many things that the word because the word has to enter into the mind then it goes down to the heart brother Aaron says and greatest battle ever fought so if our mind is fought with everything else but the word how can it produce itself you following me I mean you say well this is a lot of work but if you've got the vision of what it will produce you'll say Lord I want your word to manifest in me I mean so so we don't want this so and that's what happens many times we want an instant fix but God gives us a seed like Israel cried out for a deliverer he gave him a baby right it was the Messiah but it had to grow become fully mature and then he manifested his Messiahship a menace like the word the word is a seed but it's got to grow I mean but then you can be so caught up in a service you can walk out the doors be consumed by this world and what's going on what's happening the world comes in and chokes I mean what what's just been so on amen that's why whatever things are good true and just and lovely and honest think on those things that's the Word of God you should think on those things you say well you too heavenly minded you'll be no earthly good know if you're too heavenly minded you will be earthly good I mean because you'll be official for the kingdom of God hallelujah you know brother Billy Paul said to his daddy said daddy all you think about is God you know like it's a bad thing it's not necessarily bad sure we've got to have jobs we've got to look after our family look after natural things but they shouldn't consume us right the whole thrust of our life should be the word should be living for him because he's worth it amen now this this and then he also saw that though the wall that was the stone wall there all was broken down we know wall as a as a barrier it's a protection if you know if you build a wall around something you your wanting to protect it right it says in Proverbs 25 28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit as like a city that is broken down and without walls so saying that they that have no you know them that have no control no dominion over their own spirit their emotions their affections conscious reasoning imagination you know all those things they have no control over that they're like a city that has broken down without walls a city that's broken down and without walls in him he just comes in and the enemy ghost there's no defense nothing to withstand it he just comes and he goes he does what he wants amen and this is someone void of understanding a slothful man that has not built a wall he following me maybe yeah so so those so the Spirit is the emotional realm they have no control over it they see something that that you know or or something bad happens to them someone offends them the resentment the unforgiveness they hold because they feel hurt and annoyed just runs rampant in their lives instead of the Word of God being the wall the defense that they that their emotions are subject to and that take control of it okay men the devil comes in resentment and you know and that just people just fester on that thing and it just snowballs and it just consumes their whole life and they get angry at other people you know that have just been nice and because someone did something 20 years ago what's happening there's no wall there's no debt there's no control over the spirit amen this world is hyped towards the senses this whole world is so engineered to to just lift the senses up we don't want to be a nun have a nun wall spirit well then how do you put a wall around that wall is the Word of God you can't stop the you can't stop life affecting you life happens the same things that happened to people in the world happened to us we can't stop it but you can stop how it controls you I mean you can actually you can actually put a wall around your spirit that when the enemy comes in just say if someone offends you something happens instead of dwelling on that thing of becoming a massive you can take that person in prayer into the presence of God amen and you can truly forgive them and to truly forgive means you actually forfeit the right to hold it against them in the future right and then you can actually come into the presence of God with that person in prayer and you will feel sorry for that person that did it to you what's that that's a wall hallelujah amen but you got to see the you got to see the value of it someone void of understanding doesn't see they just are run by their emotions unwalled spirit nothing's fruitful in their lives person void of understanding well I believe I'm not looking at those kind of people Amen see different gifts now I wrote this in my notes and this is probably the most obvious you know I say sometimes I've kept in obvious strikes again but you know we all have personalities yes we do we're not robots every personality now God when he saves us he doesn't wipe our personality right he can take the bad parts of it sure that you know but he will we're still us hallelujah and we'll still be us in eternity hallelujah so how he made me this is how I'm gonna be right he will refine me show you mold me but my personality will be my personality now with that personality comes a comes a certain gifting now I'll just take three that are very very very obvious you take someone who's a perceiver it's not someone who's critical someone who's a perceiver someone who's a mercy and someone who's a teacher those are those are gifts that we are born with right even even unconverted people like that and there's and there's more gifts than that but right but the thing is now if that if that if that gift is surrendered to God then God can use it for the body but if it's can but in that it's always like you know there's always two sides to everything there can be the good use of it and the bad yous right but it depends if it's walled now the good will be used and only the good but if there's but if the walls broken down the devil just comes in what happens he'll use the bad side of the gift you take a perceiver for example they will see something going on in someone's life and they're not looking for it as I said it's not being critical being a perceiver is not being critical that's been critical but a perceiver will see something that others will not see and if that gift is actually surrendered to God they will wait in prayer until they have the answer for that situation but if their can although just say this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong and they'll just basically destroy the people without helping them that's the wrong side of the gift the right side is waiting in prayer god wiser same thing with the mercy and mercy gift is a very powerful gift right people who can really enter into burdens and pray and help help one another but then that mercy gift can be used against the person what's happened to my pet brother Browne speaks to the interview with sister Bruce private interview I believe it's now called and brother sister Bruce is wondering she's having a private interview because she's wondering when she received the Holy Ghost because she says it's not a moment in her experience we say this is when she received it so she's wanting Lee so so she's having a private interview with brother Branham believing that the gift in his life will go back in her life and reveal this is where you received it now so so so brother brain speaking says now how could that spirit just leave something of the Holy Ghost when you get sick you get weary and you're a nervous type person and you get things on your mind see little bitty things that it just keeps building up both ways you'll get somebody on your heart and you want to pray for them you get up and pray for it and you just can't rest till you get that person prayed for that's you then you take the other side Satan maybe might present something that see out this way see your nature and God works and Satan works then when Satan tries to make you believe that you are not see you keep building this and maybe this and this see don't look at yourself sister Bruce remember so he says your nature your mercy you get burden you pray but who the devil use it against you and then so she's starting to question now do I have the Holy Ghost cuz the devil is using her own nature against her who's been there he says I'm fixing to pray for you I'm not worthy of that I think well what I do what would I do if Jesus was sitting here and what would he do if he was sitting here he'd lay his hands upon you in with his great faith see you'd get well well I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him but I come to represent him but remember me being a sinner in before God I'm not a sinner neither of you we've got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's at scene he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're sinners no more we are Christian I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman I remember the thing with sister Bruce is I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times and brother Graham says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be allotted to you see he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve Him sister Bruce is yes all right that's what He died for so you could serve him now not your your mistakes and not look not lot at you see he is your propitiation see he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve Him hallelujah now now brother I see is in Christ is revealed in his own word he says I was just talking to a young minister and his wife in the room just a few minutes ago and both him and nervous just like the rest of the world rest of human beings on earth I said remember Satan's got a punch coming at you don't care who you were he's got a right for that one punch which would you rather be that punch be blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you've got to keep covered all the time amen and to see this nervous age that we're living in so there's this place in us we have to keep covered by prayer keep it surrendered I mean you keep hitting under the shadows of the wings of your mighty by prayers keep your life sarena don't take it back up again right holy and the devil can't get you there this is in the book of Ephesians that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints hallelujah so our our eyes shouldn't be dull we shouldn't be void of understanding which we're people be of we should be a people of understanding lujah amen those who have understanding know the power and the ability of the word to wash them Allu you amen you say you know many times before we come to church we're troubled we're upset things are going on you're our mind we're all you know maybe and have ought against people we're all grumpy whatever more but then after service what you feel like you feel happy you feel rejoiced you know yeah you know you feel good why cause the word has wash that off you and when the word has cleanse you the word has changed you Amy because the devil tries to attach himself to us during the week but then the word comes and washes it away takes it away Amy I don't know how many devils would've been cast out just from the preaching of the word I mean troubles and you know being all caught up and things in you leave the service here I feel so good why cause the waters washed you I mean to those who have understanding know the parent ability of the word to wash them hallelujah Amy because we are cleansed but with the washing of the water of the word hallelujah now we read it you know so I said about you know we got to cultivate spiritual desires a spiritual appetite we were to develop it I mean we're going to watch what grows an hour yes I think it's like brother Brahim said it's like a bird you know who starts to build a nest you know it's like it's like the devil plants a thought in your mind you can't stop the bird flying overhead but you can stop a building the nest but it depends up to you what are you going to just dwell on the negative brother Bram he would he would come to a place where he would rededicate himself leaning over the Ottoman or whatever it was in his room with his wife he would pray it's a we we surrender every negative thought Amen how about you and I I think from time dog when we read you to Kate our lives we say Lord I surrender everything I'm not just myself every negative thought every ought every everything that would drain my faith disable my faith Lord I give it to you hallelujah now as as brother James did a few wins days ago from the scripture and Galatians for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love I mean so if your faith faith worketh by love he said Lord I want to be your garden I mean you'll see it's worth you know I'm not talking about salvation this year this morning I'm talking about being having a fictional faith that our walk will be effectual and then when the Lord comes by your way he sees a perfect garden no weeds the walls are high holy the angels there I'm in the Holy Ghost is there I mean everything's been cultivated just right the tree of life is blooming hallelujah says that person has understanding they're not slothful they're diligent amen because they love me faith worketh by love they put their faith into action hallelujah look at what they are now many times we allow the devil to rob us of so much victory and many times it's not even the devil that robs us it's our own selves but yet we will blame the devil and since it's not him we will remain in that cycle because you got to get to the root cause of it you know the devil the first the devil this and if the devil would tell the truth they say it wasn't me I'm over here doing this I wasn't there but it's actually our own selves with we give the devil too much credit right so many times it's our own selves that get us into a cycle of defeat it's our own selves what you know you read through the book of Judges you just go through the Old Testament what caused and and I've just taken the first few from the book of Judges what caused Israel to fall into being under the bondage of their neighbors I read a few judges to an eleven and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served Balaam judges three and seven and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and forget the Lord their God and serve Balaam in the Groves judges three and twelve and the children of Israel did evil again on the side of the Lord judges four and one and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord judges six and one and the children of is well did evil in the sight of the Lord and you can just keep going down so it doesn't say and the enemy came against them and they're in bondage no it started by the children of Israel doing evil in the sight of the Lord why because they had a fallen nature the blood of bulls and goats could not change that I mean souls their ownselves have brought them into bondage amen and it should be the same thing with you and I the enemy can't know our own self you know we become have you ever heard of the saying how people are just like a wrecking ball in their own lives they actually destroy everything they're the wrecking ball it's not the devil as their own selves they wreck their families they wreck their relationships they wreck their lives as their own selves as their carnal nature that actually wrecks everything who seen a wrecking ball swings into a building but chunks come out swingers again just smashes it down that's our own he said I love the devil's swinging that and he says no you're you're actually on the end of that you're swinging it yourself what's that now their faith is not effectual it wasn't there see Israel it wasn't the enemy's fault it was their own and they brought on the bondage of the enemy upon their selves and it's like ones that are like a wrecking ball in their own lives their faith isn't effectual because of themselves people will let their past disable their faith they will let anger disable their faith they will let unforgiveness disable their faith there's what happens people you know how was job's trial finally turned you read the end of Jobe God tells his friends get job to pray for you and it says Joe prayed for his friends then God turned his captivity when he prayed he forgave his friends I mean so his trial was ended by him praying forgiveness for his friends because his friends were lying to him about who God really was they were lying to him I think God came down said no I'm not what these these people say I am right and so his forgiveness turned his captivity but people hold unforgiveness because of reasoning and so many things are out of reasoning people reason things out in their own mind will they do tonight I have a right to be like this and they should forgive me here and all the people reason about it's not about reasoning right we don't want a reason to to to hold on to something they leave their past hold them back they let pride disable their faith God resists the proud trying to be the biggest and best bestest if that's a word disables their faith people let fear disable their faith people being worried about what others think about them disables their faith people not giving up pity things disables their faith amen you say well that's not a pity thing maybe - it's big but in God's economy it's pity God wants to give you greater than what you have even now like the rich young ruler he was rich but he had nothing all he had to do was sell all he had take up his cross and follow the Lord and he would have had far greater riches than what he had in the bank but he wasn't willing to do it people get all tense and stressed and worried their minds are caught up in things that don't even matter it disables their faith he say but I'm going through a big thing and the grand scheme of things doesn't really matter right season James 1 and 22 but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be hear of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his nature his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was those are just hearers they hear the word hallelujah that's wonderful glory then they go away forget about it and they forget who their identity really is right because but he but whosoever but but whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the law of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed so he didn't look us into the perfect law of Liberty and continues in it Jesus said a few if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed so you've got to continue in the word don't just start and say well that was nice God seeing a prophet Here I am you gotta continue in the word right you got a you know sure you got to repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ receive the Holy Ghost but you got to continue on from that you gonna continue in the word you can't just get derailed and do what you want to do you gotta continue amen are you sure you know you receive the Holy Ghost you have salvation I mean but you want your face to be a fiction right you want to grow into the statue of the perfect man come to your adoption amen so that's it it's so similar look into the law of perfect law of Liberty and continue there and see people identity is so important in this day everyone is looking for identity and that's what happens people look at the word and they can see their identities in the word do they walk away and they forget who they who who they really are forgets what manner of man he was just like looking in a glass this this is a mirror there's a glass and when we look into this we should be able to see this is me this is my identity this is where I belong not in the country not in a group not in a movement but this I mean this is my identification I'll leave but I seem that stay and keep beholding it hallelujah when you look into the word you're seeing who you really are I trust identity is so important it's because the bride is being identified by the manifested word but why live below your privilege trying to be identified in something else see and identity in the world is not going to give you overcoming power it's not going to give you peace there parsall understand it's not going to give you joy hell is not going to give you victory and that's what happened Israel forgot the Lord there I've got identified with the gods of other nations they didn't have victory they didn't they weren't living in peace they're under under the control of other people it's the same thing today what does what the movies do they predict an identity they preach a sermon you know I don't have it or maybe I do I read an article I an article about the it was about the Klu Klux Klan and the klu klux Center and have it right on me but by 1870 it was virtually it was branded a terrorist organization has basically did in the water but then in the 1920s a man made a film about the KKK and it was a it was romanticizing what they stood for and that actually produced a revival of the movement because his people they don't know who they are and then they see this film about the KKK and then all the white people say this is my identity and it produces a revival of the movement because people looking for an identity and that's why things are put in front of us in this day this is you this is you you'll be the gamer you can be the sportsman you can be the whatever this is you and people all this is yes and they look for they try and grab your who they really think they are but meet I still become that and they're not that there's no peace and becoming that hallelujah but then the Lord puts us in front of us amen more than a movie more than romanticizing something it's a reality and God is trying to tell you who you really are he doesn't want you he yeah he's trying to tell you you don't belong out there that's why you don't fit in I mean you you know many times at school there's peer pressure to to to fit into the group but then when you fit into the group you don't fit in I mean I've been there I know tried to be with the sportsman tried to be with the Nerds I was just in between somewhere floating around I didn't know where I was but then one day I heard a voice and I found out where I really belong wasn't the Word of God hallelujah you got to know where you are who's our identity he is our identity amen and and that's what's happened today the devil works on people you know why is he great movements in this world because people don't know where they belong and the devil then puts for an identity and actually tells them this is what's wrong in the world they rally behind that they become something that they shouldn't be you take white people for example you know this is great you know people say oh you know Europe's going to be by other nations and you know you've got to stand up and stand for your rights and all these things and you know what happens people rarely about their cuz I don't know who they are because their cuz the national identity is changing they don't know how they fit in that national identity it's not about fitting in national identity is about fitting in this I mean if people really recognize know I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God doesn't matter what the nation does around them they'll remain the same hallelujah but the devil plays on people's insecurities where do I belong in society I don't know and he comes like I'll tell you right we don't want to be that way let me tell you something this is from thirst let me tell you something when you're worshiping God in the spirit and truth and when it becomes a custom for you to do it don't you think you ought to do it because you think if you don't shout or jump up and down dance with the music or your neighbors doing it to think your back slit you're drinking from a stagnated stream until it fills every fiber until the Holy Spirit itself is bubbling in you I don't care where the music's playing or whether it's playing nearer my God to thee or whatever it is the Holy Spirit is still ringing the glory bells in your heart that satisfies that's God satisfying portion anything else than that you're done hallelujah we want our faith to be effectual amen brother BAM would dramatize you know when he goes hunting and he sees a he sees a bubbling stream and he says you know if the stream could talk I'd say stream why you bubbling why are you bubbling this way is it because the deer comes longer drink serve you know it's not because that cuz of the beer or some of the animal or is it because I drink from you know stop that it's not me bubbling something's pushing behind me makes me bubble holy this stream was effectual there's a force in it pushing out the water hallelujah that's the same thing with you and I if the word is the word is in us if he if he himself God Himself is in you the word is in you but it's got to push out right if you're fully surrender to them you have no or you have your peace with everyone you're not worried about you know not no unforgiveness no bitterness no resentment no pride then God can manifest himself through you hallelujah it's like Ezreal you know they were seven days they were going to go fight somebody more ever whoever it was and and they had no water they they went seven days and they found out we have no water and they even say if you go read the story God brought us out here to die no God didn't bring them anywhere they themselves brought them into the desert by their own good intentions let's go take back our land or whatever it is and then so they get the Prophet the Prophet comes along thus saith the Lord make the valley full of ditches right you won't see rain you won't hear anything but but waters going to fill the place make the valley full of ditches and so it was up to them because there was a smitten rock and that desert it was there it was there where they were but it had to be uncovered and although all that all the dirt or the sand all the bitterness or the resentment all the malice or the strife or the envy all the slothfulness or the laziness or the indifference a man had to be dug away all worrying about what people say and we are caring about stuff yo there had to be all dug away Pylea for that water to stop bubbling forth again hallelujah and they dug and then the question was how much water do you want amen they do they just want to cover a little bit of the rock once you hit the rock keep digging I haven't keep thinking I don't just want a little drop drop drop job that's not because the waters is there's a big gusher eternal gusher it can't run dry it's impossible for God to ever run dry run out of goodness I'm it's I just want to drop I want to be flooded I want to be swimming holy I want to be stuck I don't know where the land is that's how much water I have hallelujah and that what you want God rivers of living water would flow forth there's no what you want amen that's what we need to do so as as the Apostle Paul said to Philemon that the communication of thy faith will become effectual he wants our faith to be official by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in thee by Christ Jesus see if you if you keep looking at yourself you want this we know there's nothing in ourselves there's no good thing right but in him if he's in us there's all good things in him right be you to acknowledge what's in you by Christ I mean then then your faith can become effectual that's just like you know if you know we go to the Old Testament if Israel didn't know where their borders were in the Promised Land they would never have taken the whole country if they never knew it was there to take they would never have taken it right that's the same thing in Christ if we don't know the land is there the word is here to possess we won't possess it amen but then if he's saying that the every good thing that you must acknowledge I mean every good thing which is in you by Christ Jesus that's how your faith will become effectual that's because if you're really a believer if you say well they should be joy their faith will rise the occasion you'll possess that joy you say well their peace should be in my heart I mean faith will arise and possess that peace how they ever have an overcoming fate of a real gumption real like Lord I want to I want to possess the land I don't be slothful I don't want to be lazy I don't want to be ineffectual I don't want to be like a God and covered in thorns and thistles with a wall broken down I don't want the devil to come in and just ride me anywhere I want anyway once hallelujah if that's in you I mean to have that desire faith will rise the occasion you will possess what is yours I mean you may have to put in a lot of effort but it's worth it I mean what is the effort self-denial take up your cross follow him Saint Lord you can do it hallelujah that's how it's got to be done so now we're going to acknowledge every good thing which is in us by Christ amen so in Christ is overcoming power amen and he overcame all things and that same life as in you overcoming power I mean the ability to subject the flesh to the Word of God is in Christ when he was in Gethsemane he said not my will but thy will be done he subjected his own body to the will of God for his life hallelujah what's the will of God for our lives I mean we wouldn't be full of bitterness resentment full of the world stuff being busy about things we should bill do you know this thing should be subject to the life of God within us this thing isn't redeemed yet that's why we're looking for a body change amen but they should be you know I'm gonna I didn't realize what time was I'm gonna quit but you know we need to look at what's in Christ and acknowledge it that it's in us hallelujah perfect faith perfect peace perfect joy overcoming his nature I mean being a peacemaker being merciful being long-suffering hallelujah we need to look into these things say Lord of it's in me I'm going to acknowledge it's in me that's how my faith will become official I mean but if you acknowledge oh this person did this and this is going wrong here and the world's falling apart here and fear and worry and all these things if you just look at those things it will disable your faith amen can we have the musicians we'll pick it up again some other time we need to begin acknowledging what's in us in Christ amen Amy let's dance shall we I mean let's sing that song we are I think we finished Donald
