[Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] um drippy thing when you put a mask on um welcome down to forest lakes i get the job of the really boring mundane stuff to do without the safety thank you um so we've got the simple things like one person on the trampoline at a time um just simply because there's no warranty on it once you go over 100 kilos on there so it's just as easy to say one at a time and they have got a smaller one um so these types of people reading themselves the thai swing is four people at a time if you need to evacuate down on the field down there there are numbers one to eight one to twenty two sorry for the cabins to get you marked off to know who's here if we're here to evacuate for a fire and around the top of the roundhouse they're above the office where those cabins are that balcony around the front is only a fire escape so kids if we see you out there we'll think the building is burning down okay so you don't need to be out there unless the building is burning um it hasn't happened yet in 50 years so hopefully it won't happen this weekend um so those those are pretty main date after swimming pool if you're using the pool there needs to be adult supervisors there they need to be over 16 and once you get over eight people in the pool then you need to have at least two supervisors um what else is the boring things i forgot about don't go swimming in the lake it's really dark and if you drown it'll be really hard to find you okay so only swimming in the pool and are you using the mudslide then no so we won't worry about that one um the other thing is that noise travels around here we've got quite a few neighbours so outside our noise curfew is 10 o'clock at night the other really good housekeeping thing for you to be aware of is that our mosquitoes are just starting to come out so if you leave your door open and your windows open and your lights on at night you may come back to your room that's got some extra visitors and mosquitoes aren't that great for helping you sleep so at night make sure that if your light is on your doors and windows are shut and the rest of us pretty much just have a great weekend and if you've got any questions i'll be pretty much in the office most of the time you're here and otherwise there are quite a few people here that know how to contact us [Music] good evening praise the lord hallelujah amen we're here again [Music] [Applause] amen there was uh a bit of time where i thought we weren't going to be here again but we're here again so i'd like to welcome you all the name of the lord jesus christ trust you all found where you're sleeping and everyone's comfortable and everything's well and i mean so uh just a couple of um housekeeping i've got some housekeeping things as well let's find my find my list there it is here um so as liz was saying they have a noise curfew um but all we ask is after the evening service children can you please not be playing in the playground some people will probably be sleeping so no playground after the evening service also after the services brother cabins asked and i agree if we can just stay in the sanctuary as long as we can you know don't go wandering off and also you know we're here to have fellowship with each other so don't go wandering off into bush walks at night becoming one with nature you know have have fellowship with each other you know there's a dining hall there's plenty of spaces where we can have fellowship parents please look after your children you know they're they're your children so i've got a little one and he runs you know so you know i'm in that bracket too but yeah so yeah just please keep a watch out um also can you please stay out of the kitchen and the servery unless you are rostered on for the duties and also by the on the notice board there by the entrance of the dining hall i've put the duty roster please go check that out and also put it on the pin board and the lake lodge as well so please go check that um and then also you know we don't have any rules about cell phones but you know i recommend let's make the most of spending time with each other because this might be the last camp we ever have if it is and we're going to rapture praise the lord but you know you know there's so this world is changing yeah and so make the most of spending time with each other is that yes and i believe that's all where all i've got but i believe we're in for a special time in the presence of our lord jesus christ uh we have brother alpha preaching tonight which i believe we're gonna have a real treat with brother adrian in the morning and um i believe you know the lord is gonna do something you know we we get what we expect and brother abraham says in the message straight as the gate he would say this he says the other day leo and i was sitting on the street and some of us talking and i kept feeling there was a change coming a change coming when we spoke of it it wouldn't be a change in my ministry because it can't be no more but it'll be a change in me i've always been a weakling and just let people lead and guide me and send me this way and that way if i'd done something the lord told me to do a long time ago i wouldn't be in the trouble i'm in today and he says i'm going out the next week to be alone with god to pray and you know he says i don't want to be a weakling i want to stand on my convictions so he says there won't be a change in the ministry and i could say especially for the bride and the end time the word is open you know the fullness of the word the fullness of christ has been unveiled in this day so there's no more i mean christ is fully unveiled so it's got to be a change in us like elisha he had to be changed to fit elijah's mantle right so it's got to be us you know the word is here christ is here the book is open but you know i took this quote when i heard it i just want to apply it to myself i want there to be a change in me because the word don't need changing amen but the enemies are changing me that the word can put on flesh and a greater measure in my life that's what i want i want more of him to live so let's um let's stand uh this evening and let's commit our lives to the lord who'd like a touch from god this this camp who has burdens and needs and lord go meet me meet maybe a loved one or a protocol or amen you know our god doesn't you know there's not too many issues that he says no that's too much i can't deal with it you know he's the almighty god who made heavens and earth so and he's mindful of the situation's ruins let's just dedicate our lives to the lord uh this evening gracious heavenly father as we bow our heads and then we bow our hearts before your great presence and we are asking that lord we want to thank you for this weekend that we could gather together as a people we want to thank you that we can spend this time we appreciate it we don't want to take it for granted and i just want to be like the woman with the blood issue lord she pushed through lord until she touched your robe the master's robe and i want to thank you you're still the high priest we touched by the feeling of our infirmities and lord as a prophet i just read that quotation he said there have to be a change in me lord i just feel that's for me lord maybe a change in me lord may i not be the man that i was when i came lord when i drove through the gates into forest lakes but may i leave a different change man closer to you more like you more stable in my walk lord more full of your love more full of your goodness having a greater burden for the loss and a greater burden concern for lord your your word lord jesus and a greater love for you and your and your children may you granted i pray may there be a change in me and we just want to dedicate our lives into your hands i just ask you to touch every life like only you can you're the great physician i pray that you'll bind every hindering spirit in the name of jesus christ if you have preeminence in our lives have preeminence in this campground dear god i pray your angels would be all around this place and may your great presence be here we want to thank you for your presence here we invite you lord and you know the needs and the questions and the burdens that we carry lord i want to thank you

life we commit our lives in this camp into your hands and name the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless your friends amen god bless you amen praise the lord amen it's very good to be here tonight that's the formalities out of the way not that brother ben was formality but you know mary and martha were busy one day well martha was very busy one day dealing with all sorts of natural things but mary just sat at the feet of jesus to hear what he had to say and and the lord said to martha when she questioned why are you letting mary should be helping me and he said one thing is needful one

fellowship that had gone away it came back that love that had gone away it came back hallelujah praise the lord let me just let me just try and read a quote hallelujah praise the lord i don't want to take much of your time saints i believe it's just the first service hallelujah praise the lord praise the lord i'll just read a quote from the uh the prophet says a man running from the presence of the lord hallelujah somehow another i just saw we going there's something laying right ahead of us wow when i saw this quote i jumped and said lord thank you you're giving me a promise there's something laying ahead of us that's what i was saying brother at the end of these meetings there will be something that would have happened if you can't see somebody being raised from the dead but i know there's a soul that's dead that's going to be risen up hallelujah there will be a resurrection of the souls there will be a resurrection of the people hallelujah the greatest miracle ever hallelujah praise the lord these people that we think they are christians brother but they are not christians yet they come to church every sunday they pay their tithes but they are not yet christians that's why jesus stand back to peter and say peter when thou art converted praise god when peter he had spent so many years with jesus saw so many miracles with jesus but jesus said peter when thou art converted god could see right straight into the heart beyond the long dresses beyond the long dress the long hair and stuff beyond the ties that we put to owner so that this is still a fresh young man there is still a big job to be done but at the end of this meeting there is something that's laying ahead of us now just remember i believe i am prophesying oh prophesy this morning my brother prophesy this evening i believe i'm prophesying great joy lays ahead hallelujah brother i'll be so happy after this thing brother after this meeting i'll be the happiest man after this meeting brother you'll be the happiest person ever oh why all my burdens rolled away all my bird has been taken away all my financial problems will be solved then joy comes back into my heart hallelujah do you know there are some christians that that do have joy because they've only got money in their pocket when there's no money no joy but brother sister a true son of god a true daughter of god with money or no money all [Music] the child is dying hallelujah oh this way they've given you a brown envelope at work do you know what that that tells you've been fired [Music] you are involved in an accident oh this way it confuses the devil it confuses the devil and devil's like what kind of a man is this what kind of a person is this until he drops down his armory and he says i will leave this one he's a madman hallelujah praise the lord sometimes you make me feel like preaching in shona because i feel i can't really express it what i want to express hallelujah it reminds me on the day of pentecost when the fire came down brother oh hallelujah times of fire fell upon them they all spoke in diverse tongues but they all understood one another they overheard one another why they were in the presence of the lord they were in the presence of the almighty hallelujah something happening some great joys lays ahead of us true joy brother from the depth of our hearts believe it that's right many saddened hearts will be made hallelujah do you have anyone who said in this morning anyone who's feeling low there is a promise just wait for your time the angel of the lord is moving brother do you know what happens when you a farmer plows puts the seeds in the ground after seven days what happened you see all the way they were they were like they were put in the ground in the same time same day same moment but you only see one that comes out first where are the others they're still coming god bless you sister they're still coming they are still coming the lord bless you hallelujah hallelujah praise god they are still coming that's the same brother when the anointing strikes that brother over thee hold on hold on say lord do not pass me by don't jump don't rush don't do anything stay there stand still that is why the prophet will say be reverent now you're jumping up and down does not bring the holy ghost down alas it disturbs the holy ghost if you are jumping out of your emotions himself come into you start doing the jumping the running around if it's not there better sit down or else you block the movement of the spirit hallelujah brother i've seen the movement of

endlessly waiting contenting for the faith say lord what you have done for that brother let it be to me too i remember revelantly approach the throne hallelujah praise the lord saints just help me i don't want to take much of your time praise the lord but i feel the presence of the lord is in this place how many feel the power of god is in this place whatever you need whatever you desire whatever you desire brother oh just have a positive attitude only it reminds me of sita haiti right oh hallelujah they were in a small room brother in an ugly small room but the presence of the lord respected that room because of a positive attitude as brother branham was giving a testimony brother pranam was giving a testimony sister hit the right side the right way that struck the heart of the lord that's nothing but the truth the heavens were moved with a positive attitude brother have a positive attitude it's not my brother who's preaching lord it is the holy ghost lord do not pass me by look beyond the kitten brother look beyond the veil hallelujah praise the lord great mysteries will be made clearly people who are sad who pretend into joy hallelujah restore unto me the joy of my salvation and renew every spirit within me that's my prayer i've been praying this during the week and even last week when we were preaching we went saying lord my desire was lord restore unto me the

still preaching and we are writing another book of x we are writing another book of x brother the apostolic age is still going on and the holy ghost is still moving on and the holy ghost is the same yesterday today and forever meaning what you did yesterday you can still do it today and you will still do it tomorrow hallelujah if you filled others with the holy ghost why not me oh god what did they do that made them get the holy ghost if i can do the same can't i receive the holy ghost too surely you will receive the holy ghost the prophet says people fail to receive what they want because they don't come onto god's stems they have got their own terms brother but god is saying i want you to do this one two three and i will do three four five six but you guys you want to jump one two and you go three after doing three then you say lord fill me with the holy ghost that's not the technique that's not the equation hallelujah so something great is going to be happening the presence of the lord will fill some people with the holy ghost that's my desire there is a burden upon my heart sayings wherever i go whatever way i stay wherever where i am i want to see the power of the holy ghost movie yes we might get all the monies of this world yes we might get the cars of this world yes we might get the wealth of this world but it will never get us anywhere but if you get the spirit of the

same spirits that raised christ from the dead what was that spirit the spirit of christ the holy ghost hallelujah the bible says when they pierced him up on the side blood and water came out of him
