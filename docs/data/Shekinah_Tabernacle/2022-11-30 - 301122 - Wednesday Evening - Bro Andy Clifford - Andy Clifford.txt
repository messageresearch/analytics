just before we start thank you musicians can we just um if you've got any prayer requests um do you want to just we'll just have that discussion now because I just feel that the way that I've been led to finish the sermon is kind of up and not Landing the plane so I believe that if we discuss our prayer requests now then we'll take it to the Lord in prayer amen so does anyone have any requests or anything they would like to just quickly make knowing while we're standing anyone yes Shannon Sharon Marriott yep yep Sharon Marriott's dead amen hallelujah yes so that's Peter Edie's mum yes well

near to him and the family down there and brother Arman we have a request down here Abraham your friend Marcos Marcos we can pray for Marcos amen Hallelujah yes yep amen healing from headaches I'm sure that every there's a few people in the room that would like healing from you know that headache thing that comes around all the time and you think oh it's coming back again and but you know there's got to be a day where that Cycle's broken and let that be tonight who wants that cycle to break tonight is anyone in here that wants the headache cycle to break that's a that's just the result of the curse you know headaches and ailments and all those things so I believe that we can have faith to heal from those things the Lord can heal us and take that Philistine and be like a shamgar and that cycle one day those Philistines came and they came for the last time hallelujah amen so I pray that tonight that headache Philistine will be the last time amen amen yeah all Martini for joy in

I'm sure he's a wonderful brother that we can have some fellowship amen hallelujah amen we praise the Lord I think what we'll do now is we'll just read while we're here amen if there is another request or you have a request before the Lord you can just lift your hand before the Lord and um he will answer your request so if we turn in our Bibles to Isaiah chapter 10 verses 27 . um I think that's just the universe so and I want to speak on the anointing tonight amen amen hallelujah and I mean that's such a big subject but we've we'll just touch on a couple of points here all right man say Amen when you're there Hallelujah this is here and it shall come to pass on that day that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulders and his yoke from off thy neck amen and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing amen amen you may be seated God bless you Hallelujah I want to read that again I just feel like it needs another emphasis amen and it shall come to pass in that day I believe it's this day as well we're in that day who believes we're in that day amen amen hallelujah that his burden shall be taken away from off by shoulder amen hallelujah stop carrying the burden it's not yours the devil tries to give you all those things the devil tries to lay things on you you try and lay things on you and you know you don't have to carry those things the Lord wants to put one on you and that will be from him but you'll find it easy in life amen amen hallelujah so that listen to this that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck no longer will you be driven and tossed to and fro by the devil no longer will you be stared by the devil this way that way you know and be controlled by something that's not the Lord hallelujah the Lord wants to take control amen and his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed it because of the anointing amen because of the anointing of the Holy Ghost see the Holy Ghost and the anointing of God comes to destroy the enemy's works it comes to heal it comes to break spells to break witchcraft to break curses from families to break genealogical problems and and to heal from generational sicknesses and heal from things that has hurt you and and complexes and all these burdens that human beings pick up and carry and they don't need to we don't have to the anointing is here and let me say that you are anointed I want you to just say I am anointed I am anointed Hallelujah you know he made you hype our Kings and Priests he's made us Kings and Priests a priest must be anointed and so when you follow that thought every believer is Anointed Hallelujah amen you know I want to just now just go to 1 Samuel chapter 16 11 to 13 and you see that David was anointed by the prophet here hallelujah and you know that you've been anointed by a prophet's message you're Anointed with an open book message you're Anointed with an unlimited release of God's word of God's anointing and this is an anointing that is so powerful that it will change your bodies this is so if you think of this anointing that's so powerful to change your bodies how much can it deliver you from Little complexes and headaches and and sicknesses and ailments and hindering things that God wants to break Cycles in your life Hallelujah God wants to have a powerful prayer meeting tonight that will change lives forever Hallelujah and he wants you to gain access to know that you've got access to the anointing that he's given you for the prayer meeting and it's not based on your behavior it's not based on how well you perform today I just want you to I want to clear that it was later on but let's clear that now it's not based on your performance or your behavior it's based on on your motive it's based on are you doing it because of Love or are you doing it because you want to show selfishness you see if you you do it because of love then it'll flow amen because you believe and there's love and it will flow in the spirit of God will begin to operate no it's not now now when you have condemnation and when you have doubts and when there's flusterations it hinders the power it breaks it pulls the fuse out you know that you you start getting condemned by your own behavior and you think I haven't performed today and and I've done these things wrong and I Bachelor them today or I thought that and I did this and that's all the devil wants for you to get into that state so that God can't use you but you see without when you don't when you have faith and when your motive is pure and and and and there's a pure Selfless Love motivating you the anointing will flow freely in your life and it's your it's the anointing that God's given you amen so let me just go to 1 Samuel chapter 16 and it says and Samuel said unto Jesse I hear all thy children and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keeps the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down until he comes hither and he sent and brought him in now he was Ruddy and with all of a beautiful continents and goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward Hallelujah and we know the results Hallelujah who knows the results that's the results of the anointing Hallelujah and that anointing you even as we heard on Sunday David longed to for that to be in him it was only around him that's in you hallelujah it's not just falling on you you're not just anointed in the spirit or In the Flesh you're anointed in the soul and it's coming from the soul and it's coming with an unlimited delivery amen and it's not based on your performance it's based on what you believe it's based on faith it's based on faith on the finished work of Calvary because he did it when you operate under the love of God it's unlimited so tonight don't let your day behind you or your past hinder what your prayers will do and what God will do through you and through the anointing that is in your life who believes they're anointed tonight who's anointed to pray those requests we saw and we heard they're this that we're asking big we're asking small we're asking all sorts but God the Supernatural is here the anointing for you to tap in and speak and pray and watch the supernatural unfold Watch What Happens Hallelujah who believes God can do all things amen who believes he's Unlimited in his power who believes he's willing to deliver him willing to heal Hallelujah he's willing to change your life he's willing to save your children Oh Glory he's willing to break headache Cycles tonight he's willing to give all Martini happiness and joy Hallelujah there's Devils that will try and hold these people in a prison but the anointing can break that yoke Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Joel 2 23-26 it says now I want you to see the effect of this anointing Glory be glad then your children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God hallelujah we're children of zioner for he hath given you the former Reign moderately I'm so glad that's passed amen amen it's not moderate anymore it's the fullness Glory amen and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month who believes we're falling it's the former and that rain this falling amongst us falling in these Services amen hallelujah you hear something it's quick and straight away you walking in it it's not 20 years before it becomes apparent it just becomes so real Hallelujah you can receive divine revelation as the word comes forth and the transaction can take place to go from the the mouth to the soul just open and allow God and allow the power of his word and the anointing Hallelujah to break the Yoke of the enemy Hallelujah and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the flaws shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with the Vets shall overflow with wine and oil amen wine and oil symbolizes Revelation in the spirit amen the Holy Ghost and Revelation amen who knows that in the third seal how the the Lord spoke over the devil and he said hurt not the oil and the wine hurt not the anointing hurt not the people to receive the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that is why under the opening of the word you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost and the Next Generation can be baptized with the Holy Ghost and the Next Generation and the Next Generation why because a mandate went forth and the devil cannot touch the anointing over your life the gifts and calling of God are without repentance amen God cannot take it back it's something that's given to you and he will not take it back when you you know we think oh you know us as parents sometimes you give something to your children then they're naughty and you take it you think are you being naughty you can't have that oh my God God doesn't do that he doesn't do that with his gifts he doesn't do that with his anointing amen the only thing that's going to hinder the anointing of God in your life is selfishness pride and things that can be easily dealt with as long as you can humble yourself to the word of God Amen and let God search you even while you're sitting here there could be selfish things that's gone on in your life that and you wonder why is there no Supernatural in my life why is there no presence of God in my home maybe there's a little sin that's hindering and you can make that right tonight you can just unblock that channel tonight just say Amen Hallelujah Glory and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten amen who loves restoration the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm Hallelujah you see the devil tried to eat down the tree eat down the bride eat down the church and he'd just done it so all over the church ages until the church was eaten down Hallelujah God said I'll restore it amen and you're in that restoration you're at the Pinnacle of that restoration it is happening now operating in your life Hallelujah glory to God and the and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has Eden amen hallelujah I'll restore the leaves of Fellowship amongst you amen the canker worm I will restore the bark on the tree Hallelujah and the caterpillar I'll restore the fruit amen hallelujah so this fruit amongst you amen the palm of I will restore the life so the sep comes out of the ground and into the branches in your life amen who will sap amen the oil the life of the tree Hallelujah see the devil tries to take that out of our lives but tonight stand stand and say no I'm not letting you because there's been a mandate over that devil and he cannot hold me from my anointing he cannot hold me from Revelation he cannot hold me from drinking the wine of the Holy Ghost and the word when it comes forth amen I'm going to come to church and I'm gonna I might be in any kind of condition but I'm going to leave full of wine full of new wine I'm gonna leave with Revelation I'm going to leave with a greater anointing amen hallelujah receive it amen we sometimes get so accustomed where we come to church and we sit in the Pew and we learn but it's not that it's far greater than that amen it's an interactive thing amen you've got to participate Hallelujah the battle's an array the Philistines are upon you what are you gonna do right now the Philistines are attacking your mind trying to hinder you from receiving the word trying to distract and all these different things to make you unbelieve or make you lust or fear or whatever the Philistines are always trying to attack to bring you down and hold you back but what are you gonna do what are you gonna do it's time to fight it's time to lay hold it's time to stand Hallelujah don't let up don't let up don't let the devil just come and Rob you of a service this is a this is an opportunity hey man what a great opportunity we have tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah now look at the fruit of this when these things was restored he says in my great Army which I send among you among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and I love this because this is one of the hindering things for the anointing and my people shall never be ashamed Hallelujah Hallelujah if you're ever ashamed remember God promised that you will never be ashamed he doesn't want you to be ashamed he doesn't want you to be in defeat he doesn't want you to be guilty Hallelujah he took you're guilty he took it all he said it's finished all the guilty all the shame Hallelujah ever since taken Oh Glory everything can't you just lay it at the cross all of those condemnations because condemnation is one of the greatest hindrances to you operating under the anointing Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory amen and it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh everyone say All Flesh All Flesh not just some not just the well-behaved not just the elect even Hallelujah are you with me All Flesh so we're opening up now I'm just going to go down a little track before we go to prayer of the the anointing is not based on Election like that that's not based on Behavior it's not based on anything other than he said I'll pour it out on All Flesh and so there's an anointing that comes on false prophets good prophets all sorts of different people even Kings Hallelujah God even calls Cyrus his anointed you know that I'll read it soon God calls King Cyrus a Babylonian Idol worshiper has anointed and I thought my goodness if if God can call a Babylonian King has anointed how much more can his bride be anointed but she spends too much time and fear and broken down and condemned by her own conscience because she's seen a holy image preached in front of her and people hiding their true self and because of it she's condemned all the time and down but don't be operate living the supernatural Hallelujah based on how good you behave today it's not based on how good a year you had it's based on your motives it's based on your faith it's based on you believing Hallelujah now that doesn't mean you shouldn't repent when you do wrong Hallelujah this is not a license to kill a license to Thrill or a license to go and do whatever you want Hallelujah this is I'm what I'm hitting a point here I'm hitting a point and I'll get to it now oh I think we need to play Squash more Mario man this preaching stuff man is good Fitness Hallelujah oh my God okay that I will pour out my spirit on All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall profit so you're old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and I believe that I believe that that is happening I believe that this is happening right amen amongst us hallelujah it's because if God is faithful right our daughters are prophesying our sons are seeing visions and and men are Dreaming Dreams and young men you know this is God speaking to us he's leading us because the Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God amen hallelujah and I want you to be led tonight in prayer Hallelujah I want you to be free to tap into the anointing in your life God's anointing is here God's heart is towards those requests and all the unsung requests that people haven't mentioned and the things that's going on in your life Hallelujah the Philistines are here goliaths are standing waiting for to be defeated although you know the Devil he's just waiting to be defeated God created an enemy that somehow keeps getting in the battle and he knows he's gonna die Glory he knows he's going to be defeated he knows it's over for him and he's still so proud and so stubborn that he'll still fight you to the end and I thank God even though we don't like it it's record Hallelujah we may not understand every battle we go through but it's for the good Hallelujah because God is exposing things in our life that has come from the past that's come from things that's been done hallelujah that he wants rid of because the anointing is here to break those things the anointing is here to break those habits tonight to break those things that's holding you down to break thoughts that are not meant to be there that have somehow attached themselves as a stronghold in your land and every time that cycle comes down and the Philistines set themselves an array to come and take your wheat Hallelujah God said your wheat shall be full Hallelujah your vets shall be full of wine and oil you shall be anointed your life shall be anointed your family shall be anointed your walk shall be anointed your church life should be anointed amen everything about you should be anointed Hallelujah amen Satan hurt not the oil and wine amen stop damning the people now we have to rise up above those things and discern the enemy because the enemy Hallelujah is snaky and snarly and slimy and he sneaks him tries to condemn you for thoughts that he put in your mind try to condemn you for for trapping you and he'd spend ages and he creates all these billion dollar movies to trapular and then you fall and then you go in the Trap and then he condemns you for the Trap that he made for you oh my don't own it Hallelujah for tonight you see what the devil wants is for you to not access your anointing When you pray for you to just go through the motion and have another church service another prayer meeting and walk out the same walk out and all you did was set a prayer but what God is calling us to do tonight amen is to really tap in to that Supernatural gift in your life amen to that Supernatural calling in office as a priest as a king a priesthood has Dominion I mean a king has dominion and a priest has access Hallelujah you're anointed to access the anointing in the Supernatural of God hallelujah amen I'm about to close and my people shall never be ashamed amen and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit Glory amen you know as condemnation looms down upon you as you begin to get into its a rut and you feel like you haven't performed or you've done something and there's just unable to to to make it right Hallelujah God is faithful and just to forgive you Hallelujah says if we confess our sin the moment it leaves your lips children adults the moment that it leaves your lips you're forgiven it's it's finished Hallelujah the blood is enough remaining under the anointing despite daily failure see this is what the Lord is calling us to for the gifts and calling of God or without repentance amen Jesus says that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust and even Cyrus as God's anointed known as God's anointed in Isaiah 45 verse 45 it says thus saith the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand am I holding to subdue Nations before him all right and you know how God used Cyrus to bring forth the restoration of the Jewish temple and and and bring forth the second temple and the building amen so you see God can use someone that hasn't performed very well amen I'm just showing you that that's not based on your performance it's not based on your behavior it's based on faith it's based on finding God's will it's based on finding what does God want with the situation Hallelujah and and dying to yourself we'll get to that in a second brother Brandon says this and this is the second hindering point that would hinder is selfishness amen selfishness is a very big issue because half the time there's no demons involved that you can cast out you can't cast yourself out amen so if there's a selfish nature within you it needs to be you need to change that you see the uh Paul says to the Ephesians or I think it says now put put off the old man in all his ways and put on the Lord Jesus Christ and begin to conduct yourself hallelujah amen because there's certain things that just requires you to change your habits and begin to become selfless Hallelujah if you want access to the supernatural become selfless amen get lost the Lord show me Lord where I'm selfish show me Lord the hindering selfishness in my life so that you can operate through me oh my Lord help us amen you can as brother random I think you said this about self-recision come up and get anointed with oil from all the preachers but unless but that's not going to do anything it's actually you've got to do the opposite Hallelujah he says here Hallelujah in God's only provided place of worship he says now if you get everything running just right it's going to run everything's set in order if there's a short in that wire that light won't come on it's talking about the power of God but because it's been grounded and when you'll take one of God's words or one of his places and in your own heart have selfish objectives selfish objectives it'll ground the power of God right there oh if you do it because you want to be smart you won't or you want to be different from somebody else or something right there it's grounded Hallelujah that's true right there it's grounded it'll blow the fuse you're wrong you've got to come with sincerity with all your heart and your motives and your objectives placed right on God then search for his place find where he said and bring it there amen hallelujah as I said come into God's world find God's mind about it see prayer is not changing God's mind it's not you begging before God that he will be have mercy and change his mind towards the situation it's now coming before God in worship and approaching him with Thanksgiving in your heart and praise into his courts and and when he comes he begins to reveal to you the very discernment of the of the situation and then you begin to speak and then you begin to pray and the anointing that is allotted to you begins to operate Hallelujah we all have offices there's places and callings in our lives and when you find that there is glory and power and authority that is attached to that office Hallelujah mothers there's an anointing for you an authority hallelujah hallelujah fathers there's an anointing for you Authority glory and power that's attached to that office it's a privilege before God Amen Hallelujah and all office bearers and all callings and Ministries and all the different helps and governments and places in the church Hallelujah when you find your calling when you find your position there's an anointing that is attached to it there's an authority that's attached to it and when you find that and when you begin to pray along those lines you'll see God answering your prayers you'll see Supernatural things happen but when you go in just a general and you and you pray for this and you're praying and you're trying to answer into that and doing that work in that Ministry and everything and you wonder why is it not Supernatural why is God not answering these things but he's answering them because see they've tapped into their office they've tapped into their anointing they've tapped into their calling an election and God is honoring the office amen Glory that's why when you go to the pastor God will honor the office of the pastor to help you to change things in your in your situation and discern situations in your life because he's honoring the office and there's an anointing that comes with the office amen that's why it's so important that's why Peter said when you make your calling and election sure you should never fall or fail meaning that you're you've been established and then you begin to pray according to those giftings in your life there is an anointing there is an attached Authority that goes with it and that's why it's important tonight that when we pray you know you're praying through that office of your own life you know who you are God's revealed to you your ministry and you begin to pray in that Spirit you begin to pray under that inspiration and God begins to answer your prayer and he begins to change the situation around you Hallelujah are you with me that's not too technical that's not that this is this is this is true dynamics of calling an election amen Hallelujah can we have the musicians we'll sing a couple of songs before we go to pray you see this anointing when it begins to flow you will find that your motive is love you will find that the love of God is Flowing your motive isn't I've got to do this because I've got to prove myself I've got to do this because I was told to do this by other people or I've been pressured into it by a culture or by a certain Church Spirit or the spirit of somebody else or mother and father Spirit but I've been motivated by love I love these people I love this I love God and I want to do that which is is pleasing to him my motive isn't because I'm going to go to hell if I don't do it my motive is because God I love him amen because I love him and so I'm anointed despite performance um it's based on faith and not Holiness amen and yet God calls Holiness he calls for us to Perfection and to be Perfection but it's his record that he's seeing it's not your record amen the Lamb's Book of Life is the Lamb's Book of Life not your book of life it's the Lamb's record that's what the lamb has done it's what he did in your Steve so that you could be perfect before God and when you come before him amen and you confess your sins and you make it right even tonight before we pray maybe it's time just to make things right before God so that you can pray and all he sees is perfection amen hallelujah we don't approach God tonight based on our performance Hallelujah the supernatural it's based on ceasing all selfishness and believing God Hallelujah and I just want to finish tonight Samson Hallelujah all his life everything was all wrong and out of cater he allowed lust to rule him and he allowed these spirits to come and he got tantalized by Philistines and and by the Philistine woman and it brought him down you see there was a lot of self involved and it was not really working the way it should and he found himself he found himself in a grinding meal Hallelujah going round and round and round and his eyes were plucked out but you can see now as the Bible said when Samson finally died to himself when selfishness was gone when selfishness had been died too and he was completely surrendered and he was helpless Hallelujah and and all his selfishness was gone he said let me die and to avenge mine enemies and the Bible said that Maul was killed in his death than in his life and so I want to encourage you tonight that as we pray let's stand as we pray tonight pray and just say Lord just once more Lord just once more Lord I'm dying to myself I'm dying to my own objectives I'm dying to all these things so that I can see the enemy come down amen Samson died physically but God is calling us to lay on the altar he's calling us to lay on the altar amen who's here tonight to say just once more Lord just once more Lord just once more Hallelujah if I've been selfish or forgive me oh God if I've if I've been if I've had condemnation Lord I lay it at your feet if my conscience has affected me Lord and I just want to place it under the blood Lord amen just once more I'll die to Pride I'll die to self oh Lord reveal it Lord hallelujah I believe that the Lord wants to Rod a great victory tonight amen I believe that in the anointing is here for you to break through and tap into that very power of God in your life as we pray amen and let's just sing a song Amen let's sing O Victory in Jesus My Savior forever amen Hallelujah just remember you
