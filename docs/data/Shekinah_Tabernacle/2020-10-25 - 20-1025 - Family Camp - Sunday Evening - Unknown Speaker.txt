just to know him in such an intimate way is so beautiful and i just thank him for what he's done for me so i hope this song is a blessing [Music] i walked by the tomb of buddha i looked inside and saw his bones i traveled on [Music] to see mohammed still wrapped up in his grave clothes then i just need [Music] let him lay but the precious lamb god's own begotten he was no longer in that grave and if you knew him like i know him you would know that he's lie and if you felt him like i feel him [Music] resurrection [Music] deep inside you know he's living and death has died so if you're standing in the darkness come and step into the light nails got hands reach out to help you [Music] to pull you safe from death to life yes i too have stood where you stand how can i trust in things unseen but just one step in his direction and then in life he rescued me and if you knew him like i know here would know that [Music] he's alive and if you felt him like i feel deep inside you know he's living and you ask me [Music] like i feel and is [Music] [Applause] praise the lord we're always blessed aye that's with all the songs um well today i'm not a singer but i am a sunday school teacher and um so we wanted to do a little something for the children and we did it yesterday and we're doing a little bit more today so when i was asking the lord to call my nerves because i like speaking in front of children but not adults he said just speak to your sunday school and that or i take naomi friesen's advice and think you guys all have melon heads but i prefer to actually thank you you know sunday school so um i first want to say thank you first to our children can all our children stand up for a moment these are some really really great children and they're the apple of god's eye so you guys can sit down thank you and and they're so cool because um in one of the presents they got we got some eagle kites and we got to fly them today and this is i just want to tell you how cool they are um miss rebecca mary over there says to me because i could only find four eagle kites right and there was one hot kite but anyways i had to get the hot because there was none else uh nothing else and so rebecca sees this hot height she goes i'm not gonna fly that that's a hawk i'm not a hawk i'm an eagle hey so we got some really really awesome children and um i work with some really awesome awesome brothers and sisters in sunday school as well can i just have them stand real quick because i'm really blessed to work beside them and they go in and out every sunday for the impo you can start us off can i just have a hand for our sunday school teachers yep landy we've got landy and adamand over there is the head of the sunday school i think they're a bit shy or they're maybe not here we got melissa over there yeah she's shy she wouldn't stand up um but they're a real blessing [Applause] but and i do also want to thank um emma and chris and rachel milam for helping me blow up balloons like 140 balloons and put up boxes until three in the morning and also jeremy peter david julia stacy and jude because they were the cat they were the um youth facilitators and they were going all over the place yesterday for the treasure hunt they were awesome um and so i'll tell you our theme real quick our theme was um treasures you know the um i wanted the children to know that they are god's treasures and they are treasured and he um yeah we'll go into the skit a little bit and they'll tell us more about the flowers i wanted them to know um for the girls that they are both they're all beautifully made individually they're not all the same and they're not meant to be um god makes us all different different um i've written it down um a specific person in their hand we're handcrafted and we're um fearfully and wonderfully made for the boys we got a pile of rocks because i don't think they can identify with flowers and we showed that all the rocks are different different colors shapes and sizes but together in a body of believers we make a strong fortress hey fellas and then for the parents over here in the box we've got some um jewels i'll just show those awesome thank you um and we pass these out and to show that we're all jewels in god's crown we're not all the same but we make up his well we're gonna make up his crown so um if you know me i cry a lot do you guys think i can my sunday school do you think i can get through this without crying okay look if i didn't have tears to express either joy or happiness or you know sometimes sadness i'd explode so it's better than seeing a head explode than tears um however so we're going to get on with a play so now that oh and so the treasure hunts they went all around and then they found these huge boxes full of balloons and presents and what i wanted them to see in the balloons was that they're worth ten thousand or more more than ten thousand worlds so that's how much they mean to the lord um okay yep okay guys this is for you so children if you have to stand up stand up so you can see i'm sure your parents won't mind and if the adults behind you have to stand up they can stand up but get on your parents knees if you want to get a closer look do so richie smirness hey he's a he's a rock as well he's solid man i've seen him in sports he is solid and he's going to be listening tonight i can tell he's pumped um so um we'll go ahead and get started now this is a bit of a serious one for you guys and i hope that it hits home and stays there okay um okay we can do this um adamand go ahead so it started before the world began you and i were with our heavenly father we were praising and shouting for joy we were fellowshipping with god almighty then our father had an idea he wanted to do something very special for us he wanted to make us a world a place to enjoy all his amazing and marvelous creations and they're amazing creations they're mountains and trees and animals and he made the whole earth for you for you for you for you for you for you who he wanted to give us presents all around us so that we would know how much he loves us and adores us and because of these amazing presents we of course love him and adore him back then sin and satan took us away kidnapped us separated us and he cries for us and children and we cry for him what could he do he had to pay the kidnapper a ransom and on earth for a ransom we they give money they want money the thieves want money but he couldn't give money we were more than money to him we were more than gold and silver more than oceans and kingdoms and stars and planets and earths well earth we were more than everything the flash's car the biggest boat what could he possibly give more than all these things what is the greatest thing that you could think of what is possibly greater than all these gifts he made us the creator himself he is more than anything and everything and to him we mean more than anything and everything we mean more to him more than even his own life and you know what else he did he knew there would be sickness and pain when sin came and while we are here on earth he wants us to be well and happy and for that he took whip after whip after whip so that we could be healed he allowed himself to be hurt and hurt and hurt so that we don't have to be he paid the ransom just drop it he gave his all he gave everything for us so that we could be together again [Music] now we are his and he is ours again there is nothing that can separate separate us we will never be kidnapped again we are his and he is ours and guess what right now and he is making and preparing a new earth and a new heaven for who for [Music] [Applause] us [Applause] see [Music] amen jesus paid it all amen we've got one more item before we um and we'll just sing one or two songs after that i feel a nice atmosphere here tonight and so the um if the chicano choir could come up just and well there where they're coming up you know i just share a bit of a testimony about the song as they come up to prepare to share a bit of a testimony about this song because you know in light of what we've seen like as what the lord has done for us what it says in return is present your body's a living sacrifice you know like it's not just he does that but actually we recognize what he's done and we if he loves us enough to do that for us then we need to trust him we can trust him in his dealings and and his ways are far above our ways and that's what the song is about is a lot of times in your life you don't understand what's happening to you you don't know why things are like how they are you know if i could share testimony about this week four or five years ago in the camp i think the first camp we had here i was standing in this position here in this spot here i think playing bass guitar in life as i knew it wasn't going very well at all you know it was bad but god told me when i was standing here that i'm going to give you peace and because i've been fighting fighting a battle for years and years and years and it just wasn't looking good and you know you get that and you go home you think well it's just i'm going to get peace straight away it got worse and worse to the worse that it's ever been but you can trust god if god said he's going to give me peace and he's going to give me peace it doesn't matter if it looks like there's not peace there's going to be peace you know and and i can declare today that i have pretty much almost got peace you know from all those enemies are gone and and but it's can you put the words up to the song you go through i just want to encourage you because a lot of the times in your life you won't understand what's going on but you've got to apply faith to your situation god knows exactly what's going on you you're not where you are by a mistake or an accident or god doesn't know that you're there nothing in your life is an accident have more faith in god than that don't let satan tell you oh maybe this may be that no god knows exactly where you are and he's got a plan even if it all looks bleak and that's what the song not that one it's the other one it's the words are if you lead through the valley i'll go and in faith i believe that you know what is best for the plan that you have in your great mind if you lead where the eagles saw where my joy and my peace overflow then i know that you must think i need refreshing if you pour out the oil in the wine or if you lead through a blazing fire if i have to wait until the morning comes i'll wait you can have it your way jesus your way you can have it your way jesus and that's what a surrendered life is to christ you surrender all to christ you so you can have your way in every situation where the good or bad you praise the lord and that that's true victory for a [Music] believer [Music] if you lead through the valley our goal and in faith i'll believe that you know what is best for the plan that you have in your great [Music] but mind you lead where the eagle soar when my joy and my peace overflow then i know that you must think i need refreshing if you pour out the oil and water or if you lead through the blazing fire if i have to wait until the morning comes away you can have it your way jesus your way you can have it your way jesus your way if you lead to the battle i'll stand for i know that you say by your right hand and you teach us my fingers [Music] where there's tear drops and heartaches and trials i will know this is just your horrified fire if you pour out the oil and the wine [Music] or if you lean through the blazing fire if i have to wait until the you can have it your way jesus your way you can have it your way jesus your way and when it all looks like it's failing you can have it your way jesus and when all my foes have me you can have it your way and when the blessing's full like a fountain you can have it your way jesus and when i conquer every mountain you can have it your way and win it all and when it all looks like [Music] you can have it your way and when the blessings flow like a fountain you can have it your way jesus and when i conquer every mountain you can have it you pour out the oil and the wine or if you lead through the blazing fire if i have to wait until the morning comes away [Music] if you pour out the oil and wine or if you lead through the blazing fire and i have to wait until the morning comes opening if you pour out the oil and the wine or if you leave through the blazing flour if i have to wait until the morning house away you can have it your way jesus your way you can have it your way jesus your way [Music] you can have it your way jesus your way [Applause] let's just sing one song tonight we'll stand and sing one song and then i'll ask for the tabs where to come up at during the song give me jesus in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise give me jesus give me jesus give me jesus you can have all this world but give me jesus [Music] oh and when i am alone when i am alone give me [Music] give me jesus give me jesus you can't have all this world but give me jesus oh when i come to die when i come to die give me g give me jesus give me jesus you can't have all this work but give me eggs give me jesus give me jesus give me jesus you can't have all this world forgive me give me jesus forgive me jesus give me jesus [Music] you can't have all this world but give me you can't have all this world but give me jesus [Music] [Music] oh [Music] jesus died [Music] oh [Music] strong [Music] [Music] what the lord has done [Music] was oh yes [Applause] jesus died was [Applause] [Music] to them [Music] again thank you loving father oh we worship you lord jesus jose jose [Music] to the land that was slain thank you jesus father we just so grateful father we are a thankful people tonight my god when the just the magnitude of what you have done for us and what you are still doing [Music] we want to say thank you thank you for this time thank you for the atmosphere that's that's created thank you for your presence because lord if if you're not here then this gathering is a waste of time but we're thankful tonight to know that we are in the presence [Music] of the king of kings the lord of lords [Music] the lover of our souls father you know what needs to happen tonight father we're just willing vessels lord one thing just to step out of the way and let you take over you know what burden you've laid on my heart for tonight lord i've committed it to you so i'm your father [Music] the people is ready you are in our midst it's like i think it's in the book of first or second kings when elijah said everything is ready at thy word let the fire fall that's our expectation tonight in jesus wonderful name amen and then god bless you tonight i mean before we turn to the word we could just take our seats just for a few moments i don't know i always just feel so i feel always so unworthy when i've got to stand before his purchase position but i also want to greet you in that precious and wonderful name of our lord jesus christ i want to thank every believer that needed to come in and be part of this tremendous meetings it's really been so special to me and i just want to say god bless you do believe that the majority of us that's here god has done something for you um i want to thank the shekinah tabernacle you know i wish i could call your names but i don't want to single anyone out each and every one but ben you've got a great team you do i'm telling you it's just just just to see how everyone works together and just the way things are flowing just god richly bless you and i just i felt actually i wanted to single someone out tonight um it's a sister that's always so quiet you don't see much of i don't know where she is right now and that's just the christine cloyd i know she's hiding hiding somewhere it's just that christine listens to this i certainly say sister christine my wife and myself we appreciate you just always sort of in the background but standing and supporting your husband being the wife of a minister or even the wife of a pastor it's not easy there's a lot of pressures and stuff that goes with it but sister christine god bless you when you do listen to this know that we love you amen so if we could just stand to our feet this evening now when brother ben contacted me the lord laid two specific thoughts or burdens in my heart and the one burden the lord allowed me to release last night and i didn't know what was going to happen over this weekend but i knew that god was going to do something special so um if we could if we have our bibles if we could turn to exodus chapter three now freddie read the same scripture this morning freddie and i didn't compare notes he had no idea that i was going to read the scripture i had no idea that he was gonna read the scripture this morning so i panicked a bit when he read it so it's exodus chapter three and i'll just read just a few a few verses there um just and pray for me i'm just just very nervous exodus chapter 3 verse 1 it says now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not built and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said yeah am i and then i've got another scripture we could turn to it in acts chapter 9 and then we can just say word of prayer and then we can take our seats acts chapter 9. acts chapter 9 and it reads verse 1 and saw yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were they were men or women he might bring them bound into jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly they shined around him around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art our lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecute us it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and he trembling and astonished said lord what will thou have me to do and the lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do lord your word has been read and father we just now hand everything over into your hands you speak and we will listen and we will obey in jesus name amen you may be seated tonight in the presence of almighty god so i was saying that when brother ben contacted me the lord gave me two direct and distinct burdens thoughts or titles whatever you may call it and obviously last night the lord allowed me to release the burden of last night and the the the the thought that the lord laid on my heart for tonight in the i'm gonna give a title and uh for me titles are not just titles but um it's something that is real something that is tangible and and something that i believe you and me we can identify with and my title for tonight is this i was one way now i am completely different something supernatural happened to me that's my title tonight [Music] i was one way whatever that way was now i'm completely different because something supernatural happened to me and you know what that's my testimony like i said this is not just words so as brother tears saying that he speak of an experience and the inspiration behind it i asked my wife to sing that song tonight satan you cannot cross the bloodline you've lost the battle for souls my inspiration is that the devil is a liar [Applause] now when you go home and when we leave this place i want you to walk wherever you're walking whether it's wellington whether it's auckland where it's north island south island i want you to walk with an attitude of the devil is a liar [Applause] i want you to hold on to that receive it then as i was sitting at the back and the skit was going on and that background music was playing something inside of me just wanted to scream out freedom because that is what has happened and is happening this weekend was one way now i am completely different something supernatural happened and i know as i look at the faces of the believers tonight you can identify with it you can identify that something you can't maybe you can't explain it i was talking to brother andy's friend matt that matt i was talking to brother and his friend today and he was telling me that last night he says he can't explain it but something special happens and i believe it's nothing else but a supernatural god that came down to your seat now before i go on the lord impressed on me just to because obviously a lot of believers i'm a new face and not not much people know know me the lord just impressed before i continue just to to drop a little bit of my own personal testimony said you know where i come from and why i am the way i am you know ever since i can remember i i remember when i came to my senses whatever age that was all i knew was god's in the prophets i walked i lived and i breathed god sent a prophet i i i was i was brought up under i'll use the word um the canopy of the message i i i lived in a message home and i went to a message church in fact pastor harold beckett dedicated me as a little child so i i grew up under the canopy of the message as things in south africa took turns i found myself moving with my families and we ended up sitting at home and listening to tapes i've got three four siblings and i remember every sunday morning without fail my dad would take out a cassette tape of brother branham and i think my parents they might be watching on the live stream today so i want to greet my mom and my dad and i thank the lord for godly parents appreciate young people even parents appreciate your parents so i remember as little children we would um go into our lounge and dad would get in those days it was cassette tapes and dad would put that cassette tape in the tape here and we as children would sit on the couch and dad would press play and we have to sit and there were times when you'd sit and you think to yourself how long is this and then after a while because sometimes on that we you know it was like upright thing so you could see a little bit so you would watch so so this part of the reel would be before right so this is the start so i did before and then this so you'd watch when is this part of the reel gonna fill up because that will tell you where the tape's gonna finish i don't know so that was my life i every sunday listening to the trips of brother branham and then i was talking to brother matthew and i was saying i've got i've got family that's that's very studious in the word my uncles they my brother adrian and nathan they are able to go so deep into the world and i remember i would i would sit with these brothers in fact i'd find myself sitting in the corner and then the brothers would get together and they'll come with stacks of spoken words and then they would come sit down and then they would fellowship and this would be like all nighters at times and they'd fellowship about this and that and they'll take the quotes and they'll ended up obviously arguing with each other sometimes they even ended up fighting each other well that was the way it was in south africa and before he knows about it but you know i would sit there in the corner and i would listen and i would desire not to have the fights and all those things but just what i was listening to i decided to have what i would hear brother branham say yeah after a while as i grew up because i you know i grew up under this environment i started knowing the quotes and i could then also sit with brothers and show how intelligent i am and i could sometimes also argue and out quote the next person and i would think man you so special man but through all of that i felt empty i thought that i had a relationship with jesus because you see and this was just me right growing up under the canopy of the message all i would read a spoken word and listen to types of brother branham and i would never read this this was occasional reading three then i would study and because i knew next time we're gonna get together they're gonna come with some deep thing and i want to be ready but i felt so empty and i thought hey because of the knowledge and because you know stuff that means you know i'm spiritually i'm in relationship with jesus but you know what i came to realize afterwards i was actually in a relationship with books and with tapes and with i'm going to say this books and tapes and just the letter of the quote that was my relationship i thought i was in a relationship with jesus christ i thought i knew him but my life was empty god eventually worked in my heart and i went to go find myself a message church and i started then associating again with believers in fellowship my parents eventually followed me today thank the lord my parents are pioneers they store warts in the fellowship back in south africa so i i went there and i i started you know just meeting up with believers still having this perception that you know the more i know the more spiritual i am but i remember the day my life changed [Music] because you see i because i grew up under a message environment and because i knew the quotes of brother branham i knew how to act in front of message people so i had this some kind of message lifestyle no life to it right no life just a style of uh you know we don't the brothers don't wear shorts and you know sisters we don't cut our hair so i i i sort of portrayed all of that to the people out there but i was empty and i remember going to a convention in fact it was a camp like this and uh it was in 1994. it was over there the christmas time and uh we had some good meetings now remember going into the into the into the hall and you know walking in i'm a young man right so i'm kind of cool i think i'm cool my wife and i always tell people this my wife and her family thought different they thought that brother tears was some kind of geek it was like weird but i thought i was cool and you know i i would and brother one years reminded me i spoke about this in london you remind me what i said and i remember i used to um you know i was one of those guys i used to like to have my hair but long and i would have that round brush and the blow dryer and then i would stand in the morning i needed to get my curls right and uh i would have like what do you call those things a little bit long here at the back but just just long enough or short enough so that the believers wouldn't notice it so i i remember you know just going to church i remember going into that meeting and i remember still sitting down and you know you're slouching kinda you know just checking what's gonna happen yeah but oh not checking what's gonna happen but knowing what's gonna happen you know it's gonna be a normal message service you know so the minister's gonna come up and he's gonna read the scripture obviously and then we're gonna hear some great stories about brother branham and we're gonna hear some awesome quotes and you see the meetings that i used to attend man it was wild but there's a quote that i nothing another they use that quote fairly but for the random says in expectations i'll rather have wildfire and no fire at all so these people in these meetings said man it was wild so i'm i'm sitting there in that meeting right the minister is preaching and i'm sitting there like this and everyone is on their feet and everyone is jumping and they're standing in front and they're aiming the minister i'm i'm sitting there now i'm obviously feeling a bit uncomfortable because i thought i'm spiritual writing here these people are all excited and i'm sitting there after a while i just stand up and you know just because everyone's doing it but you know what god he is so wonderful [Applause] because even though i sat there and i pretended like you know other people were pretending this was going crazy a meaning in having no idea what the minister's saying and in fact that service was a six hour service six hours you remember that very six hours six hour service but i remember it was the twenty um i've got the date here the 25th of december 1994 that was the day that god changed that is why i can say yeah i was one way now i'm completely different something supernatural happened to me and it was at a camp i remember sitting in my sheet and the noise was going on and people were going crazy but god was zeroing down on tears and tears was sitting there after a while test started sitting up now i was very unemotional and you know now i'm very emotional i never used to cry because crying was for sissies right and i remember sitting there and there was a sister actually just a couple of seats away that she had an eye on me so i was sitting there like this and after a while i started sitting up and then i felt a teardrop and i thought what's happening yes i went quickly make sure no one's looking and then the next year came and the next year came and after a while it was like a damn head burst and then the sister that liked me was and she started she sent some tissue papers across man i was i was embarrassed but something was happening to me [Applause] i had come into that meeting maybe call me a dead stick had all this information in my head but nothing real it was all just good quotes but then something happened to tess on the 24th of december 1994 i still remember the shirt brother could ben that i had on so profound was that event the people were still going crazy all around me but something was happening to me i couldn't help after a while i just stand close my eyes and just worship i never used to worship i never used to raise my hands but something within just pushed my hands up i just couldn't help but worship but thank him [Applause] and i walked away from that meeting knowing that something supernatural happened because then dan started reading more of the bible and you know what and i hope it's okay for me saying this when brother branham says he says the bible became a new book to him now i identify with that words because i always when i used to read the bible i'd always read scriptures but i could never ever see myself in the word whenever i would read something it's about somebody else i would see the posture the minister the deacon my mom and my dad never me but once god changed my life i the bible became a loving book to me the quotations that i then started reading it became life to me now between 1994 and now did i have my ups and downs and did i have my struggles did i have my failures yes i did but he was helping me and he was maturing me and he was helping me to grow so i can say today that i am a product not of the letter of the message but of the life of this precious message has changed me transformed me and that's the desire i have for my own children me and my wife we always talk and we say we can go evangelize everywhere out there but we always say lord help us not to forget our own home start in my home so this message became real it became life you see i was destined to fly foreverless i wasn't destined like a chicken in the barnyard i was called for better things than that and you are called for better things than that you're not a chicken so if the devil tries to tell you a chicken you tell the devil devil shut up [Applause] he's called me to be an eagle to fly the heights of the world i'm thankful to almighty god that he allowed me to hear the voice behind the voice to hear the voice of god calling me and i'm grateful that i responded it's so important to respond i think i don't have it here there's a quotation of brother branham where he's talking and god is moving you know where the brandon had this discerning discern and god was moving over somebody and brother branham said god is moving won't you respond and i think the person didn't respond initially but then the holy ghost in brother branham he made brother branham call out the person's name and then she probably reacted it's very important to respond when god is calling you when god is trying to to catch you like we heard this morning when he's trying to catch your attention it's very important respond the scripture said in paul freddy said that this morning author moses turned and responded then god spoke to him now this word as we know has got transformation power it can take a fully stinking sunnah make them the most humblest of christians i don't know most of you know brother matt oval in our local assembly he was a drag alcoholic but god took that man turned his life around and today he's a minister of the gospel of jesus christ so this word has got transformation power i want you to know that i want you to receive that because when you leave this camp the enemy is going to come after you no doubt you know what this word did it took an impulsive peter gave him an upper room experience turned the life of peter around so that he became the spokesperson and could give you and me the prescription as brother branham puts it i read the scripts he took this word took a soul that was persecuting the church of god took us all on his way to damascus had his damascus road experience something real more than emotion something real and turned him into a poor an apostle of jesus christ a prisoner of jesus christ it took a moses a cowardly moses running from pharaoh to have a burning bush experience that changed moses that throne moses from a coward to a one-man invasion [Applause] that's what the word of god is able to do one more two more it took a deceiving jacob to read about jacob deceiver to have a wrestler for the angel and you'd walk away a different man with a limp but a prince with god one more this word took a tasman that was just a normal message member living a normal message lifestyle just walking like message people walk turned tesla's life around [Applause] so now casual loves a message life not a lifestyle a life is something that's alive message influenced influence brother branham says once i was a sinner i'm saved by the grace of god i know something happened to me i identify with those words i know something happened to me you can call it holy roller or you can call it whatever you wish to but it saved me 50 some odd years ago and at the end it gets better all the time is that you can you identify with it it gets sweeter as the days go by it just gets better and better and better [Applause] give the lord a hand of praise this is real it gets better all the time he says so i enjoy it and that is about being a christian it's not boring it's not a drag it's real it's real it's real and i enjoy being a christian i enjoy telling the devil to go [Applause] and i enjoy seeing him running [Applause] random says someone says you've done gone crazy i said well then leave me alone i'm bitter off this way if you want to call me crazy call me crazy i'm better off this way [Music] he says i'm better off this way than i was the other way now if there's still some here tonight that's the other way i want to encourage you come on this way it's better i'm better off this way than i was the other way so just let me stay the way i am i feel better this way and i'm doing better so an encounter with a supernatural god it changes your life completely then when you sing that song the things i used to do i do them no more you won't be singing a lie because a lot of times you know we sing lies but then you can sing with a true conviction because you know that he has changed your life so i said with moses it changed moses life that he became a one-man invasion he changed paul's life and paul shook the world he changed tests and i tell you tears right now is shaking i'm telling you that because i know who i am listen to brother adrian out there in europe god changed a brother adrian gray that's what god does and is doing amongst his people brother branham says here brother and sister there is a secret place that every believer should go he says the back side of the desert there on those sacred sins he says oh no doctor of theology no greek or hebrew scholar no school or seminary they might twist you all up in these kind of things but if you ever met god on those sacred sins satan can't put his feet on themselves you see you know that you met god you know i know that's why i can stand you with boldness because i know i met him you talked to god yourself you had an experience yes then he says in in him and let me stop you this often and say this that each one of you people that's been born again of the holy spirit now i identify with this quote he says you remember the very hour where the holy spirit the very spot where he met you and when doubts come now i know for many of us here this weekend god met us he did something special but the branham says when doubts come and doubts welcome and fears begin to rise and fears are going to rise he says there's always that certain place that you can come back to that time where you met god and he says it's where you met god and you talked to him you know you met god on those sacred sands it's very important you need to know that you know that you know that you met god and you will see it in your life you'll see the change in your life you'll see the change in your appetite the things that you desired for in the past all of a sudden you don't have that desire anymore something real happened now the devil i said earlier the devil is a liar and i want you to receive that the devil is a liar hey satan was wounded at calvary his head was bruised his back was broken his sting was removed now imagine the person with a broken back walk bobby in a wheelchair cursed head that's your enemy now this enemy will try everything that he can to stunt your growth to stunt your growth means that you grow until a certain point and that's where you stop now this word is taking us higher and higher and higher now the enemy is going to want to do everything that he can especially after god did something for you this weekend that day on calvary brother branham says what did he do he says god zeroed in on calvary he wounded that animal called satan forever [Music] since then because it brought light to the human race and anyone knows that a wounded animal is at its most vicious crawling around brother branham says with his back broken now satan was locked out at calvary but his vicious is forthy and he wants to get you especially the young people he wants to get you and i believe this weekend you are leaving this weekend equipped and ready and the lord told me to to present this to you tonight he's going to try everything that he can to get you to get you to make a mistake to get you to feel guilty to get you to do all sorts of things the devil will come and tell you that you are nothing but i want you to know that the devil is a liar so when he comes and he tells you you are nothing you talk back to him and you say devil you are liar the other thing he might tell you is you're not a good christian you're not a good christian because you're not a good christian you might as well just continue doing what you're doing now god will and can come and tell you that you're not a good christian but god's objective is to help you to grow the enemy's objective to tell you not a good christian he wants you to go further down so when you go out there and the devil comes and tells you you're not a good christian you tell him therefore you are a liar [Applause] the other thing he'll tell you is that nothing really happened to you at the camp it was all just a bunch of emotion you just cried a bit some snot was running and tears nothing really happened when the devil comes and he tells you that say devil you a liar i won't listen to you i know what happened to me [Music] he tried to give you my battles you try to mess around with your mind you try to tell you all sorts of things but you just telling devil but the tears said i must tell you you are liar and why are we on that thing about the devil coming and giving us all these thoughts there's a scripture in the bible galatians chapter 6 and verse 3. that scripture says for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself i think of that when a man or woman think themselves to be something when they're nothing they the scripture says he deceiveth himself so that is the man or woman that's walking around thinking on something when he or she is nothing but that person is walking under an atmosphere of deception and it's not the devil that is deceiving that person it's not even the friend that's deceiving that person the bible says for if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself so the moral of the story of the scripture think the right thoughts don't walk around under an atmosphere of deception because the enemy is going to feed it and he's going to fan the fire and he's gonna make you feel worse and worse and worse and worse doesn't matter what comes in you define the enemy i'll tell you what to think of caesar philippians 4 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are on us whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any place think on these things i want to encourage you this evening [Applause] don't allow negative thoughts to come into your head defy it say go back to where you came from devil you a liar i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i am more than an overcomer and the devil is under my feet he's under my feet you know in the book of first kings chapter 23 it talks about and i'll be closing off shortly it talks about naboth and it talks about ahab and it talks about a neighborhood having an inheritance given to him by his father and the inheritance was a vineyard now ahab desired the vineyard of naboth and he came to naboth and he says neboth give me your vineyard and i will give you something else in return i'll give you money or whatever the scripture says but ahab wanted that vineyard and he was prepared to pay nabath for that vineyard but you see naboth i believe was a believer that stood his ground you see naboth had an inheritance that was given to him by his father and they both said i actually read the scripture says and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee now that is what the devil is going to try to do to you he's going to come and he's going to offer you many other things that looks enticing but i want to encourage you today that when that happens you stand your man like a son of god and you say god forbid i will not let go of what has been given to me because what is mine brother andy is [Applause] mine you see the gates of hell is against you especially the young people i look at you i i say man you guys are just so awesome and then this i look at and i know many of you that's what i'm looking decide because this is where i see most of the young people i know a lot of you and there's some greatness within you you have the ability to shake this whole new zealand it's in you it is with andy [Applause] so don't allow the enemy to rob you and any other young people here or here or parents or moms or dads or grandparents don't allow the enemy to rob you [Applause] of what you have because you see i have been i've been to many many many many many too many many camps and i've i've i've been one of those coming out of the altar crying and i've had friends with me but i thank god that for me it was so real that when i walked away nothing that the devil could try to do to me would work because something real happened i've got a brother-in-law in fairness brother-in-law as well in london gerard he came from wherever he was came to portray his house lived in their house he came there as a sinner he's seen something real in the life of the family that changed his life completely he had a definite experience with a supernatural god [Applause] so hell is going to come up against you but i want you to know as powerful as hell is because when the brandon tells us he says the enemy is powerful as powerful as the enemy is a god that's within you and in me is more powerful than the most powerful demonic force that's out there the musicians can come and i will just read this quote in the message the great and mighty conqueror i love this quote brother branham says he says man was refused from heaven he says man was refused from heaven he says the highway to heaven was closed he says there was no highway but where there was no highway he our great lord jesus he come to make one then brother branham talks and he dramatizes and he talks about the earth and he talks about the coverings over the earth so he says the first line over the earth he says was demons of doubt demons of doubt that will make you want to doubt your experience make you want to doubt what god did he says the first line was demons of doubt he says the next was prejudice the next was selfishness pictureless demons demon powers all over the earth the next was prejudice the nix was selfishness this earth was covered over with lines of demon power then sicknesses and diseases that's what abandoned brings that picture for us it says the earth covered over with demonic forces he says there was no highway to god demon powers all around he says when he arose he says he was triumph and as he went up hey man [Music] he broke every devil power that holds over man that skit that they showed you has made it possible for you and me to love an overcoming life [Applause] he broke every devil power that holds over man the mighty conqueror he stands alone this morning and between him and every believer is the blessed old highway of holiness that the righteous the righteous shall walk on brother branham says there's not a way of escape he says there's only one line cut down he says from glory now remember we said lines of demon powers he broke through brother branham says there's only one line cut down from glory brother branham says he left the bloody footprints but the brand name says and as he walked he says here as he walked through the corridors of the demon powers he made a highway for you and for me all the way through it so as you when you leave this camp when you leave this camp as you're walking you're walking you're watching those bloody footprints that is set for you and for me and as you walk in they might be demons remember he cut through the demons there might be demons decide they might be demons the side but you're walking you're walking you're walking you're following the bloody the branch of jesus christ [Applause] and the demon of doubt will come the demon of sickness will come the demon of depression whatever demon but you walking you're walking you're walking you're walking let us worship the lord let us worship him thank him this evening give him praise give him glory [Applause] thank you jesus father you made away so like i said yesterday place the word you walk walk this walk of a true believer not a believer that's living a message lifestyle which is empty but someone that has had a supernatural encounter with a supernatural god and as you're walking you follow follow the bloody footprints of jesus christ he left that for you he left it for me and it's very important it's very important follow and walk in the bloody footprints of jesus christ because the demons is going to come they're going to slaughter you they're gonna tempt you they're going to try to pull you [Music] but you stay focused what is the ministry tell us saturday morning peter strengthen your brethren [Music] stay focused and you just walk and he will help you he will strengthen you and if there comes a time when you feel so down when you feel so defeated [Music] and it feels like you just can't go on anymore speak to your pastor speak to a spiritual godly friend call me if you want to call me [Music] the devil is on our feet he can try and he will try but i i beg you and i implore you don't give in be amen the joshua and the caleb outfits no retreat no surrender we're going over continue to serve god [Music] continue to love him [Music] continue to pray for each other continue to support each other i need you as you need me and together we will stand if it means we're going to stand back to back with our sword in our hand slaying enemies that is what we'll do there's one more thing i want to say [Music] i heard the minister once used this term [Music] i said you and i we have the sword of the world and maybe there might be times when darkness might surround you doesn't matter what the darkness is maybe mind battles maybe situations you take the sword of the word [Music] and you cut through that darkness and you cut it open so that the light of god can come in and set you free if rebound let's just pray loving lord jesus christ [Music] i do believe that there are a people here tonight that can identify with the title that says i was one way but now i'm completely different something supernatural happened to me [Music] i want to pray heavenly father i know we've got another meeting tomorrow morning but i want to pray right now this is my last meeting i want to ask each and every individual that's in divine presence here tonight and oh god you would equip them you'd help them [Music] lord it's inevitable that they're going to face demonic forces out there it's just a given my prayer tonight lord help them to know who they are help them my father to know how to use their weapon a most powerful weapon help them my jesus [Music] to pray every day a lot of times we don't pray every day help them to pray every day help them father to read the bible every day [Music] very lies our strength and victory lords [Music] that's the burden of god it's on my heart for these young people for the parents lord keep the parents and i include myself in that give us wisdom on how to rehear our children lord we're seeing a god that when our children reach a certain age

the word but to apply it with mercy i need you i need you now more than ever jesus we thank you [Music] i worship you lord [Music] hallelujah can we sing that song i worship you almighty god there is

hallelujah oh jesus there's none like you hallelujah hallelujah aren't you glad you don't have the search for eternity long he found you hallelujah hallelujah i was lost as lost could be and he found me hallelujah i was going this way it turned around i started going that way hallelujah there was an emotion tonight that was a testimony a living testimony you saw a living witness that this message works it's more than knowing quotes more than knowing scriptures but when you meet the author of the book that's when life changes and that's when life really starts he's here our jesus as the apostle peter could after the pentecost he say this is that spoken by the prophet joel it wasn't something they learned they didn't brother brown said they didn't wait in the upper room and andrew said to philip or whoever said you know i think we've been here long enough should we should we go out now no but one of them said no we're going to wait until until something happens until we know him the one we saw resurrect that comes and lives in me and lives out hallelujah and they didn't just imagine it it happened hallelujah this message releases the holy ghost upon the people it was bound by creating darkness of man but this message to call of it away and releases the holy ghost upon the people hallelujah so we can stand like peter and say i'm one of them hallelujah he's the same you know people say oh god don't do that to people no more that's a lie devil you're a liar oh the devil says you can't have an experience like that he's a lying amen the woman of the world didn't stay the woman of the world after was in the prince of jesus harley she she was transformed doesn't matter where she came from she was transformed hallelujah you say well i've done too much wrong i can never have that yes you can don't let the devil rob you i just want to say i believe he's here you can have that kind of experience that brother taz was was relaying to you you can have that kind of experience hallelujah we've had that kind of experience brother anthony hallelujah who's had that kind of experience who's met him hallelujah he's real he's more really but now than when i first met him he's more wonderful i love him more hallelujah he's worth he means more to me now oh then when i first met him oh it meant the world to be there but now after many through dark dark trials and hardship and you don't know where to turn sometimes he says hold on child i've got this i've got you in this trial i'm going to carry you through i can't my word can't fail harley you're part of my word you can't fail hallelujah you can have that kind of experience [Music] but you're just emotional can you imagine being on death row and you know the sentence is guilty and you're gonna die and you're waiting in your cell and you're waiting then one day the prison doors open and a man walks in and you're expecting this one to take you to the gallows but he tells you you know maybe you think about your last meal and then the door's open and he tells you you're free to go you are free to go imagine being in that position you can't sleep you're this burden of your guilt you know you're guilty because you did it you were there but then he comes and says no you can walk out do you think that person would just kind of stretch god whatever and just try to wander out i'll be saying thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus hallelujah that i walk out of the prison say thank you jesus thank you jesus hallelujah it's exactly like that i but if the man just rejects what the warden's trying to tell them what he'll stay there we all have a choice and jesus wants to say just accept me i'm here to change you i'm here to do a work you can't do it doesn't matter how much you've learned how many church services you've heard when you meet him he wants why did he die he wants to live in human beings he wants to have the preeminence he wants to be closer than your next breath he's got to give yourself to him hallelujah hallelujah i just want to say he's here [Music] you know uh my darling was telling me a testimony was uh brother george smith and he was a good religious boy he didn't know god and brother brahm told perry greene to go meet him or other way around and perry greenwood would pray him through and he'd receive the holy ghost and he did [Music] i can say i believe that can happen tonight i believe though i believe that if you really want him you start being to alters i'm not necessarily doing an altar call but i'm just saying you can you can pray until you're more than just emotional but something happens to you where you surrender everything you know to surrender and he gets a grip of your life hallelujah and you can get up from that spot changed and you stay changed and the next day you'll change and you just continue to be changed and you walk in power in the in his word and you're never the same person you just got to accept it so i'm going to say if you would like prayer but it's you that's got to talk to god we can pray with you but you got to talk to god i don't want to be a none of us want to be actors but a lot of
