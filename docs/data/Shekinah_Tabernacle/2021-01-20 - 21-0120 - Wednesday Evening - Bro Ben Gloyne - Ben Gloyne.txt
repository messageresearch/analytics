praise the lord is the lord god hallelujah hallelujah amen thank you musicians thank you brother andy praise the lord amen well god bless you all i mean so this weekend we're we're popping up the way so um brother isaac's going to be preaching here so you're in for a treat amen praise the lord and i'm also thought it was a good idea that if we could start listening to the message together not in terms of coming congrats together but listening to the message together through the week i know many of you are avid tape listeners and that's a wonderful thing you know this message has transforming power in it i mean so um every week i'm just going on a monday put a message on the whatsapp to listen to so so the first one is is the token but it's the one from 1963 the 28th of november amen but you know keep listening don't just you know we've got a whole mountain of bread like we've got like mount kilimanjaro but bread and we're this big and we're going to you know we're going to eat the whole appraisal you know so just just dive into the word dive into the tapes you know amen there's transforming power in there i mean let's go to the book of malachi then we're going to then we're going to go to hebrews 13. so malachi 3 and 6. we're going to read two scriptures one in malachi 3 and then the another one in hebrews 13. hey man trust everyone's had a good week thus far amen i mean like to thank the church you got me a fancy kind of computer thing here so i got new toys but i you know god bless you uh malachi 3 and 6. for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed but from that part i'll say i for i am the lord i change not he can't change and then hebrews 13 8 i know this everyone should be able to just speak it without even turning to it but amen we uh maybe maybe let's just let's just read this one together shall we jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen should we do that one more time jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen may the lord bless the reading of this word you may have your cease tonight and i want to um i was i was um i didn't read the article necessarily but it was on the bbc there's an article speaking about how to function in times of uncertainty and this is truly an uncertain time but you know this is the natural world trying to give advice how to function in times of uncertainty but you know we really know how to function in times of uncertainty amen but i want to i want to really just if all you get out of this service is that god can't change and he doesn't change well that's really where i'm going to go but you know i'm so thankful we serve a god that cannot change and he does not change he does not change his word whatever he spoke he does not deviate does not change one bit his word is his word he does not back up on any promise amen but he's fully invested his whole him whole self behind every promise amen in his word so brother ram says in the message hearing recognizing acting on the word of god in 1960 he says now that is always has been always will be god's program god cannot change his program because he makes his program perfect because it's part of him so his program is a part of him and and when you see his program you should be able to see his character within his program so for example his program is redemption because he is a redeemer his program is salvation because he is a savior and his program is healing because he's a healer and his program is to be a father to the fatherless he is a father i mean to be a comforter because he is a comforter right i mean to be a redeemer amen to to to also be a judge because he's going to judge the devil in his works amen because he's a judge amen amen and his program is salvation because he's a savior he's a lamb he's a high priest you see all of his nature is manifested in his program now brother braham tells us this is an um this is from the ephesian church age in the church age book um this is brother man spoken uh speaking about how he picked the messenger for for each age but he says the key given to me of the lord whereby i was able to determine the messenger for each age as a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the keystone to the whole bible it is the revelation that god never changes and that his ways are unchangeable as he is in hebrews 39 it says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever ecclesiastes 3 14 and 15 i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god doeth it that man should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is uh which is to be hath already been and god require that which is past here it is an unchanging god with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that god chose for the first age and how god manifested in that man's ministry would be an example for all other ages what god did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages now we find now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the holy spirit how first the the first original church was founded and how god manifested himself in her the word can't change or be changed because the word is god john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god to change one word of it as that eve brings death a sin and death even as it says in revelations 22 if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book if any man shall take away from the words which are the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which have written in this book that's what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close so god can't change i mean so the same god that's been through history is the same god today you know you'd say it was brother braham's battle cry was jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he wanted the people to say he's still the same he hasn't changed time hasn't changed him you know different you know different society hasn't changed him he's still the same god and his word is still the same now as i said in the beginning that that god manifests his character in his program so he is a sacrifice he is the lamb he is the propitiation for our sins now it says in hebrews 9 that this is the blood saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission so there must be a blood shed in order for there to be a remission of sin now that word remission means a cancellation of a debt a charge or a penalty so the penalty just gets canceled i mean it gets taken away hallelujah i mean so that's what the shedding of blood does now now some might think well you know seeing is believing but seeing is not believing many people saw him die on calvary but they didn't become believers many people saw him multiply the bread and the loaves and you know do many mighty acts but it didn't make him believers i say even in this day they saw god do incredible things i mean we're even even even church historians said that william brown's ministry was the spare head of the post-world war ii healing revival many people saw many things but it didn't make them believers but you know so seeing is not believing but it's actually when god gives us an ear to hear as down through the church ages to him that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church now we know that that air is not an audible ear i mean but it's actually in the soul there's something there's an ability to hear the word and to receive it amen and that's why that's what set the apostles apart from the scribes and pharisees as they had they were ordained to hear i mean they heard physically the same words but the disciples heard it in a different way that describes them pharisees because the reason is that that their that their response to the word one group said this is messiah and the other group said this is beelzebub two very polar opposites one is the chief of devils and one is god manifested in the flesh the messiah so you know it's it's it it's given to a people to hear amen blessed are your ears for they hear and your eyes that they see hallelu the things that you see in this day i mean to sing is not believing because some people think well if only you know i wasn't in pilot's judgment hall when he took those stripes so how could i know that you know by his stripes i'm healed or i wasn't there on golgotha when he died for me so you know how do i know that he really how did it you know how do i know that he really did it you know the simple fact is if if you've been given an heir to hear then then what what happened there on that day is attributed to you remember jesus had so many names in the book of la land's book of life and when he when he went up calvary he had those names on his heart hallelujah remember remember he came he shall be called jesus he shall save his people from their sins amen so he had your name the joy set before him was you redeemed hallelujah so when he went up calvary he had you on his mind going up the hill i mean so now now in the old testament when we look at the shedding of blood for the remission of sin we know that the high priest once a year took the blood into the holy of holies very few people saw the high priest walk in and i'm not talking even into the holy of holies because he was the only one that went in but even into the inner court very few people saw him there very few people saw him you know take the blood and walk in but after he came out after sprinkling the blood so no one actually physically saw him sprinkle the blood on the mercy seat it was only him and god but then when he came out there was a blowing of a trumpet amen and everyone who heard the jubilee trumpet because the blowing of that jubilee trumpet is connected with the blood being offered on the mercy seat i mean so as those who heard the trumpet they had to believe that the blood was now offered on their behalf they had to believe it because they heard the trumpet then they had to act on what they heard and how they acted on it is they didn't have to be slaves anymore they could drop what they were doing they could return to their inheritance so they had to hear it then they had to act upon that trumpet hallelujah and it's the same thing now today as we have had a pure gospel trump oblong it is not a trumpet of creation dogmas of man it is not bible school theology amen but it was thus saith the lord being spoken in this day amen revealing jesus christ you and i i mean that's why we can listen look into the message we know not every word is thus saith the lord brother brown said it wasn't although saith the lord he says so much as a human but then so much but it's the god but right but within the message is the revelation of jesus christ the full revelation of jesus christ hallelujah so it's those who have been given an ear hear it hear it hear it really what it is they hear beyond a voice of a kentuckian hallelujah carry all those things and they hear god amen i love it where where it says about jesus jesus did not speak a high form of hebrew with fancy words says the common people heard him gladly he spoke very simple kind of hebrew or whatever language he was speaking in amen it's the same thing in this day god doesn't speak in high fandangled words he speaks in the common language of the people i'm glad i'm a common person i can hear the lord gladly hallelujah hallelujah amen so so on this day we've had this jubilee trumpet amen and it's been blowing and and we have been the beneficiaries of that trumpet amen amen and so here we are living in a season where you know we can't go back 2000 years and see jesus die right we can't go back you know i don't know how many nails they claim were driven in his hands and feet that around the world it wouldn't do any good if we had all the nails in the air you know all those things but uh but the life that was in that blood now that was in the lamb of god that life came out of the blood brother brown tells us that's the token the holy ghost and now that life comes into the believer when they hear that gospel trumpet that life comes in when you hear that word hallelujah that life comes in and then now our freedom begins to take place in the believer's life hallelujah just like someone who is a slave there and you know you're in israel it could have taken them a few days to return back to their possession but as soon as they heard that trumpet they drop what they're doing and they begin to walk begin to return home although it's the same thing with you and i i mean we are walking into a perfect image of god i mean sure it doesn't matter how we start off it doesn't matter how you start off it's how you finish that's the main thing and if you ever design your heart for god that's all god really looks at amen the desire what you want to be amen hallelujah so we have a high priest so as i said very few people saw the high priest in the old testament walk into the tabernacle now i say even fewer no one saw jesus go up and off the blood and glory amen you know when he revealed himself there you know mary and the woman went to the tomb the tombs open and you know mary's broken-hearted and wondering where he's gone and you know sees jesus but jesus doesn't make himself known to her and she thinks he's a gardener and says you know tell me where you've taken him and i'll carry him away and then he he just speaks her calls her by name mary and her eyes come open it's you lord you're alive but then he says to her don't touch me because i need to ascend i need to ascend to my god and to your god to my father and your father hallelujah i love that because it shows me where god reveals himself to his children hallelujah so he had to be he had to go up into glory and then he came back down so he went up he was accepted came back down then he said to thomas touch my hand put your hand in my side touch me hallelujah well how do i know that he took the blood he yo yo he took his own body as an offering up there on my behalf because the holy spirit's upon the earth the proof that he died for you and i as the upper room happened amen and the proof that he died for you and i as the upper room happened to you i mean see he's not a historical god it's wonderful look at the god of history but he's not just a god of history he's the god of the presence i mean that's why i rejoice when you think about what god did in the prophet's ministry it thrills my soul number one approved proves that jesus christ is alive but number two it makes me rejoice because that same god back there is the same god here hallelujah the same god that cast out devils raised the dead healed the sick spoke tumors out of existence spoke storms out of existence brought life brought salvation by the spoken word that same one amen it's right here hallelujah you know the prophet's ministry was not seen for us just to sit around and talk about his testimony even though that's all very good it builds faith right but god didn't send it just for us to talk about what god did in william brown's life no god displayed himself on this day saying children this is what my this is what my blood achieves this is what an open book achieves a son of god in his position have been having dominion over the all powers of hell amen and his own body hallelujah amen hallelujah i'm glad we're living in this time this is 20 21 hallelujah praise god i'm alive today amen hallelujah amen amen hebrews 4 and 14 saying then that we have a great high priest that passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not in high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but it was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need hallelujah what what do you mean coming boldly when someone comes in boldly they just push the door open remember he wants us to come that doesn't come arrogantly he actually wants us to come into his presence amen but we have the right to come in boldly because he made a way it's not you making your way he made the way hallelujah hebrews 9 and 12 neither by the blood of bulls and calves but by his own blood he entered in and once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us hallelujah i mean for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling down clean sanctifiers to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by the means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance you know what i love about this oh i'm not even it's all what he's done it's not what i've done it's what he's done hallelujah it's what he did it's what his his achievement is the thing to worship his achievements what we should be glorifying amen and he doesn't say your achievement it's actually his achievement it's his achievement in our lives that matters hallelujah amen amen this message is the gospel is the gospel trumpet in this hour because it's the truth of the scripture this message reveals jesus christ in the scripture to me amen this message is sounding around the world and we know and and we know that we feel the pull of his spirit in our lives i mean and that pull of his spirit in our lives is the life that was in the lab now moving and dwelling in our hearts hallelujah you know it says in isaiah 53 and 1 who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord revealed well the answer very simply is those who believe the report the arm of the lord is revealed to amen so if you believe the report the almond lord's revealed to you hallelujah amen so if you truly believe the word of god then the strength in that word is revealed to you amen so for example you know you know you believe that the lord died for you on calvary the strength of that cross thou comes into your life redeems you changes you amen amen you believe the report that the book's come open amen hallelujah then you're on your way amen then you know this you know that every promise of god opens up to you amen you need healing but you believe he's a healer then the arm of the lord's revealed to you and you're healed hallelujah that's right i believe amen so the answer is those who believe the report for them is the arm of the lord revealed amen you can take that through the scripture joshua and caleb they believe the report amen and they and caleb got his mountain the arm of the lord was revealed to him hallelujah and he's sitting here and then he used to think of another great story this is this is blind bartimaeus his mother was sitting on the porch facing off to jordan she'd say bartimaeus just right down here less than half a mile just below the ford in the month of april where all the snows had melted in the river was way up here in the valley god led his people to the other side and then opened up the way and came across jordan on dry land and he would think of them stories he'd say but alas wonder what happened to that great god our priest tell us that the days of miracles is past those things can't happen no more that's what the trouble is today we have too much of that thing that god was but is it now the bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever just as much god today as he was then and he always will be god if he ever was god he will always be god he cannot die he cannot get old he cannot change his mind he cannot make new decisions on things he's already made decisions on hallelujah so if he made a decision i'm going to meet my children in 2021 or whatever year that you met the lord he made a decision in whatever year i'm going to meet my son or my daughter i'm going to save them holy i'm going to redeem them he can't change his decision hallelujah amen amen he's already made decisions on his first decision was right and has to forever be right or he made the wrong decision when he made it see he has to ever keep with his first decision he's perfect infinite and cannot change oh what a consolation we must have anybody seeking god must have that firm consolation that god cannot change hallelujah so god cannot change you know i'm so thankfully cannot change amen as i said before god's program is part of him so because he is a god of deliverance and mercy then he must provide a place of safety for the believer to be hidden away in to escape the judgments that's going to strike right because he's a god of deliverance and he's a god of mercy amen so noah found grace in the sight of god the bible says amen and god told him that he was going to flood the earth so so god said to know the end of all flesh is has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i'll destroy them with the earth make thee an ark of go for wood rooms thou shall make in the ark and thou shalt pitch it within and without with pitch and this is the fashion which thou shall make at the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits the breadth of it 50 cubits and the height of it 30 cubits a window shall they make to the ark and in a cubit shall thou finish it above and the door of the ark thou shall sit and the side thereof with the lower second and third story shall thou make it and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy your flesh wherein is the breath of life from unto heaven and everything that is in the earth shall die but with thee i'll establish my covenant and thou shall come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy son's wives with thee i mean what a consolation it must have been for noah this is not just for you this is for your family yeah i mean this way of escape that i've told you to build is not just for you it's for your children remember he so so he so he so he was given the dimensions of the ark and included in those dimensions were the fact that his family was coming in hallelujah i mean so what a consolation that must have been that the lord showed him that his wife and children and and his daughters-in-law were part of the promise as well amen just like it says in acts 2 and 38 39 the apostle paul would say for the promises unto you amen amen if you repent be baptized everyone in the name of the lord jesus christ remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call so so if you have repented you've turned from your sins amen you've yo yo start to walk with god baptized in his name receive the holy ghost then the promise is not just to you but it's to your children it's for you hey if it's for you it has to be for your children i mean it's for those who are far off a prodigal has gone far away from god even as many as the lord our god shall call hallelujah i mean he doesn't back up on that he doesn't back up on that promise he gave the promise he knew the trouble of the age he knew the difficulty he knew the opposition he knew that there would be a multitude of devils released in this hour they had never been upon the earth he knew that they'd be here but he knew this promise would stand and he knew he'd stand behind the promise of the word hallelujah amen so i you know he doesn't change now noah had to then put his faith into action and his boys and their wives had to believe him as well because it was actually a faith walk to get into the ark just like it is today the ark of christ jesus amen so they had to and then so to me what he did is he just took the blueprint he put it before his children he took the blueprint here it is this is the way to safety this is what's going to carry us from this world to the next world hallelujah and their hearts would turn to faith by faith now being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith amen now we know the ark represented christ and to me it had two functions and it was built a certain way number one it was a place of safety for those um yeah yo for them that they wouldn't die with those who didn't believe this is a place of safety number two it transported them into another world that's what the ark did it took them to another world and number three well this is the the the design features the arc is actually designed for maximum stability naval architects say that the ratio of the length and the width and the height to the arc is a perfect dimensions for a stable boat so it's a place of safety it's it it'll transport them to another world and it's built for maximum stability i mean see it wasn't built to be the fastest monohull hydrofoiling boat it wasn't built for that kind of thing it was built to be stable and it said hallelujah so it's the same thing with our lord jesus christ amen amen he is a place of safety if you're sealed to the day of your redemption you're safe doesn't matter what the devil does to this body you can be as sick as a dog to the day the lord takes you home but if your soul is sealed into the kingdom it don't matter what god i mean doesn't matter what the devil does to this body your soul's going to its final destination which is glory hallelujah so it's a place of safety amen and it transports it transported them to another world you say what kind of world well you know we know that the atmosphere of the world they went into was different to the atmosphere they came out of remember it was the same earth and we know when all is said and done the new heavens and new earth and you that we're going to be on this earth it's going to be renovated holy fire's going to burn it off all the devils and everything of you know that's not if god's going to be burnt away but this earth is going to be the one we're going to live on heaven is going to be upon the earth hallelujah so now they were transported from from the andaluvian world and we know that when the when when god flooded it there was the fountains of the deep opened and the windows of heaven opened and and scientists say that you know the atmosphere of that world before the flood was very different to this one it was more of a uniform temperature all the way around that's why you know in the polar regions they have found tropical plants and different things that used to grow because because how the how the atmosphere was it was just a uniform heating of the heating of the earth but then into the new world they went and it was different kind of atmosphere it was the world that we live in today and then when when when our ark takes us from this world even just into the millennium there's going to be a different atmosphere there won't be no devil there hallelujah he'll be bound a thousand years we'll have no attempt to then amen then even after that he's going to be burnt up and we're just going to keep living on hallelujah so the atmosphere is going to be really be different amen amen it's going to be an atmosphere of perfect love it's going to be atmosphere of peace and joy there's never going to be a bad day bad thought bad no trouble is going to be there trouble can't enter that place i mean unbelief can't enter into that place i mean sickness can't enter into that place it's just perfect health perfect peace amen perfect love that's not the only thing amen and that's why brother ram said about going beyond the curtain of time he says whatever you do get perfect love well what is perfect love the holy ghost himself if you have him on the inside the inside of you you've got perfect love hallelujah amen so it transported them from one world to another just as our ark is going to transport us all they had to do is get in the ark they didn't have to paddle they didn't have to set any sails they just had to get in hey hallelujah this old chipper zion it knows where it's going hallelujah amen and it's designed for maximum stability that's what the lord wants us to be he wants us to be stable christians even in times of trouble and and you know he wants us to be stable in our walk with him not not teetering to and fro not double-minded but just just fix it fixed fixed on his word amen his word declared it i believe that that's settled that just praise the lord he says but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you hallelujah what's god's plan for my life he wants to make me perfect establish me strengthen and settle me hallelujah amen i like that too amen so they were taken it was the same earth but it was different just as after the millennium you know after the you know you know there's the there's a nuclear war in different things then you you know then there's the millennium then we're going to the new heavens and new earth you know it's the same earth but the ark will take us there amen hallelujah i mean you know i love this really that's all the lord it's all him this this whole thing beginning to end is jesus christ it's not jesus christ and me it's him it's just him it's all the lord hallelujah it means that christ is our ark by one spirit we are baptized into that one body into that ark whether we be jews or gentiles whether it be bond or free we've all been made to drink into that one spirit amen so the ark made them secure from the judgments the ark didn't sink didn't matter what was buffeting didn't matter what was going on outside they were fine that was a good cruise ship to be on hallelujah hallelujah amen now brother graham says and feast of the trumpets 1964 you see uh you say the church has to go through the persecutions for the perfection of it the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride amen amen a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace too with her she has found grace with him he engages to her and if anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them maybe we should stagger around a bit what's happening i've got grace great grace upon me hallelujah and so it will be upon the bride and so it is on the bride we are unworthy creatures deserving of hell but as grace holds us through it how are we going to get through ladies here his grace is going to hold us through it hallelujah look at how many lost and blind how many how many sinners were in the world the hour i got saved god saved me for a purpose and i'm determined by his will to do that purpose i don't care what anything else goes i want to do what he says hallelujah amen in the first exodus the blood was applied on the door in lintel i just love it how where where moses is told when i see the blood i'll pass over you didn't matter you know he didn't say when i see the israelites in the house i'll pass over them when i see the blood that's all he's looking for amen he's not looking at us remember red through where red is white amen so we may have sinned but he looks at through the blood of jesus christ and he doesn't see it hallelujah and not and you know so when i see the blood i'll pass over you you know what i love about confess sin it's not attributed to you and i yeah it's put on the head of the accuser because what happened in eden there was a judgment who did this there was adam and eve in the serpent and it all boiled down to the serpent which was the devil embodied in him to do what he did and so now all god is giving a foretaste to the devil this is how it's really going to end up great white throne judgment who calls this and they'll go down and down and down and down and down and down and down him and then he can't look this way there's no one else behind him you're going to help people try oh you know this guy no no there's no other guy there it's him and he has to give an account for all this he's done and he can't dodge nothing he can't slip out of it no way he'll pay for every one of them amen hallelujah hallelujah amen when i see the blood i'll pass over you i'm so thankful we can apply that short token today that token is the life of god the holy ghost is our token today amen and when he sees his own life in you i'll pass over the death angel can't strike that place hallelujah so not only did he give a blood barrier during a time of judgment and deliverance there to israel but there was light in their dwellings he says in exodus 10 22 23 and moses stretched father's hand towards heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days they saw not one another never rose from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings gross darkness covers the people isaiah doesn't say that but i rise and shine for thy light has come so there was gross darkness upon the egyptians but in the in the hebrew houses they had light in their dwellings i mean we have light and our dwellings i'm not talking about natural light now i'm talking about supernatural light hallelujah and we can see the path we should take i mean sure the world's falling apart there's confusion everywhere you go on the news confusion and this is going on and this and you go here this and you know you try and look at the left-wing news the right-wing used to get it you know but it's all just you know but there's one sure place hallelujah there's one short place that's god's word hallelujah you know we're seeing or we have already seen but it's just becoming apparent where it says in revelation 13 speaking of america you know coming out of the earth and speaking like a lamb i mean like a lamb but they spake as the dragon and we have seen it already turn even years ago it happened where they speak exactly like the dragon speaks but now we're seeing the manifestation of it i mean we shouldn't be surprised by the things we see upon the earth even you know we know we'd live in a time where there'd be earthquakes in diverse places we've had a lot of those around here i mean there'd be famine there'd be pestilence this is all part of the beginning of sorrows i remember we have a place of safety it doesn't matter if people it doesn't matter if you get sick and die if you're sealed away you're going to go to be with the lord right so we shouldn't fear nothing that comes upon the earth whether it be famine earthquakes pestilence whatever it is amen our lives are in the rock of ages hallelujah so they had light in their dwellings we have light in our dwellings yes amen amen even even paul would say in in in colossians remember god is a god of deliverance and to deliver something you snatch it from destruction and you carry it away hallelujah and our souls are on the road to destruction didn't matter how good we are didn't matter if we raised in church or not amen but our souls are on the way to hell but then the lord delivered every one of us hallelujah i'm glad he found me don't you amy colossians 1 12 and 14 12 to 14 giving thanks unto the father which has made us uh meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light you know all i see these days he's made us something he's made us worthy which has made make it personal which has made me meet to be partakers the heroes of the saints of light he did it who did this you know sometimes you can see a big you know i walk into some three little people's bedroom it's like hurricane goes through and you say who caused this you know and and i'm not the cleanest guy in the world either you know don't get me wrong but you know but normally something goes wrong it's like who did this what about when something goes right who caused this hallelujah it's like you know our lives our lives were chaos and then they came under came into order into order with the word of god and you could ask who caused this who caused these people who causes transforming power who change these people and god just says as is my doing save the lord hallelujah amen because he's made me meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who allowed you in he did and if he allowed me and you can't boot me out and the devil can't kick me out either he'll try sure but also uh excuse me you're not allowed this is vip you're not on the list get it security get this guy out of here yeah hallelujah now we know god is not a god of lies it's impossible for him to lie it is just not in his being to lie he cannot lie it says in hebrews 6 it says wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the ears of promise the immune ability of his council confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entered into that within the veil so he it is impossible for god to lie he cannot lie impossible and we know a white lie is the same as a lie just a little remember the serpent told 99 truth to eve but that one percent error made it a lie yeah hallelujah isn't that right you know the devil when he came to quote the scripture to jesus didn't give the whole scripture where where he is told cast yourself you're on the pinnacle of the temple and then and then you know the devil told the lord throw yourself off because the angels have charge over thee but the rest of that scripture if you read it he doesn't quote the whole thing so it became a lie look because it wasn't the whole truth it was just a part of it was omitted so it became a lie that's why we need the whole scripture we know we need the whole council of god and what do we have in this day in this matches the whole council of god that's right hallelujah so god cannot lie so now if god spoke something the intent it was spoken and has to come to pass he doesn't dilute his promises down he doesn't change his promises he doesn't draw back from his promises what he said would happen will happen amen he cannot change his word because of culture technology political climate situations change he can't and he won't he can't change it amen there has never been a scripture where god has had to take his word back because it couldn't be fulfilled you just think about all the history of the world six thousand or however many years where god has been giving promises to his children there's not a single time where he said i'm sorry i i i didn't mean it that way so i was just a bit over dogmatic telling you in that fashion no no what he says he backs up and he does amen he said there's never been a time in the history of the world and there never will be where god has to take his word back because it couldn't be fulfilled because of conditions amen he did not have to apologize to abraham and tell him sorry you actually can't have isaac right he didn't have to do that amen he did not have to tell moses during all the opposition that he had from pharaoh and even when he got to the red scene it looked like it was going to be just a slaughter he didn't have to go to moses and say uh sorry moses i lead you wrong you know i'm just going to go to pharaoh and say sorry you know no no he didn't back up he did not back up one but remember he made every molecule in the ocean he made every part of this world he can just speak and it could defy every law hallelujah god cannot make a mistake amen amen his ways are perfect hallelujah and if his ways are perfect and he can't make a mistake then he'd never made a mistake saving you and it should be real personal shouldn't it you know i'm not just talking about all the world itself no we're talking about you and i yeah so he never made a mistake saving you hallelujah he's got a purpose and god it's amazing you know some people have like a niche kind of job you know a certain situation arises that's when they really step to the fore god specializes in the impossible he can do everything else but this is where his niece just seems to come to the forefront where humanly we think it's impossible there's no way this can happen you look at them at the red sea there's really a red sea and it wasn't the reed sea like some people try and say just a sea of reeds no it was the red sea and it was a sea right it wasn't just a little inlet there was the sea and they were stuck there god told them to walk there amen but you know but it's when but god wanted to display his power to them in their lives that they would see when they are facing the impossible that's when god comes on the scene and he manifests his promise hallelujah amen see it's when the believer looks like they're all against the wall all hope is gone any window of escape seems to be closed that's when he comes on the scene hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah amen now this is probably taking a segway but uh here we go now brother brahma says in looking at the unseen he says we put so much emphasis and so much concern about natural things and so little about the spiritual thing and i said for instance coming through this room right now is television pictures there's wi-fi going through this room all kinds of stuff and i said you have to show me the picture oh he said of course it hits the crystal and then and then tubes and so forth and it shows the picture so this man is he's talking you know debating with this man about different things and this man says well this is how television lights up but i said there's man in the united states and i said you're picking him up over here coming through the air that you can't see he said but we can prove it because here's the picture showing it's over there and there's a sending station to prove that it's here right amen so he's saying no the proof that that's really happening over there is because because the signal is being transmitted here and you can see it on this device amen and then so brother braham says yes and we can prove it too for in glory we have a risen savior who sends it forth and the holy spirit reveals it and makes it positive that's why i said in the beginning we have spiritual ears to hear so god is in glory he sends his word he maybe use a preacher's voice or or or the voice of the prophet or the written word but he sends it forth it's anointed to your heart and then he proves that it makes it positive amen therefore we've got a sending station and a receiving station that's correct god in heaven who knows all things can so put a gift in his church that he can magnify it and reflect himself through it now don't just put that on the prophet we'll have a gift of faith for god to reflect himself through and say things which is absolutely impossible by scientists to prove see we don't walk by things uh we don't walk by things uh we do see we walk by things we do not see now moses wrote the first five books the old testament okay i'm sure that wasn't controversial that was the first time that we have that that the word was written down before that it was just oral given that that we're aware of now this is the first time man is told to keep the word and to meditate upon it and joshua in the first chapter god tells joshua says only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded he turned not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper wherever though goes this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that's written therein for them thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success now joshua would come to the end of his life and he would tell them in joshua 23 and verse 6 be therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that's written in the book of the law of moses that you turn not aside there from to the right hand or to the left that sounds like what god told them but he's passing this down because they had to really catch god is his word amen god has his word and if we follow if we're following the word we're following god but if we deviate out of the word then we're not following god anymore amen so now you may ask the question what has that got to do with god being unchangeable well it's simple when he gave the promise because he is that promise he can't change the promise so that promise if it stood true for the believers thousands of years ago that promise is still true today amen so we can look into the scripture now if if he saved anyone on the basis of faith then he'll save another person by faith right if he saved one person by faith you have to save if he saved the philippian jailer by faith he said believe in the lord jesus christ thy thy house shall be saved and his house came in because he believed on the lord jesus christ you know many times you know i don't have the quote on me but brother brahm says many times we tell people what not to do when we should tell people what to do yeah and that and and he says that what to do is believe on the lord jesus i mean because faith works out has has an outworking brother ram says um i don't have it here but there's another quote on him but he says now you take that sword of faith and you chop your way through the darkness sometimes you may just be able to chop your way through that then you get salvation but then you can chop again and you can get sanctification he can chop again and receive the baptism of the holy ghost and chop again if you're sick you get healed you just keep chopping with that faith you say i don't have strength to wield the sword well i love it how you know there was that man in the bible he had a son with the spirit of epilepsy on him and the disciples couldn't cast him out and you know and then and then jesus asked the man do you believe he says lord i believe help my unbelief and the lord didn't rebuke him that he confessed he had unbelief because if you ever go to lord say lord help me it's his character to help yes it's his character to enable especially when it's according to his word absolutely say lord i see a promise in your scripture i want to see it manifested in my life lord help lord i believe help my unbelief and he will take you to that faith hallelujah that that promise will be manifested [Music] so it's all good that's just win-win-win this is a win-win situation and a win-win-win situation amen you may think i'm too positive i don't think we can be positive enough look what the lord has done for us how can we you know how can we be negative about any of this hallelujah amen but we now what i love about the lord not changing is if he was a god of history he's still the same god today and if he's the same god today he'll do the same things today i mean so if he healed or delivered in the past he'll do the same thing today hallelujah we have absolute confidence that he is still the same today amen brother brown would speak about jarius he says when does god dwell in a body called jesus the son of god when he was called on the scene called out of history the god who could raise the dead in the old testament bring back the life of a dead boy through a prophet that god cannot die he is god for eternity that baby laying on the bed stretched out this is dries his daughter and little jarius knowing that the schunemite got her baby back he began to see i've seen this before i've read about this before he found himself in the scripture amen he found himself this is just like the shunammite and god raised that little yo yeah god raised the shunamites boy back to life my daughter is in the same category she can be raised back to life as well amen and searching through he had heard of some man the man that claimed to have the power that was jesus of nazareth who they all hated but he called them on the scene for he was the closest representative he could find of god at that day a god of the living god and when he was called on the scene and the historical god was called up he acted the same way he did when he spoke to elijah on that dead baby hallelujah and so jarius went searching for a god of history he knew he was somewhere now remember he is the high priest could be touched by the feeling of our infirmity hallelujah he's that same one that same one with a woman with the blood and she just touched the hem of his garment and she was healed well by faith we can touch the hymn of his garment how many times brother brown would have meetings and he would call someone out in the audience and say who did they touch i'm 20 30 feet away from there they said they touched the high priest but the high priest was revealing himself through the prophet and because the son of man was being revealed i mean and that same son of man is being revealed through the bride ministry that's you and i by the way hallelujah so that same high priest can be still touched that same high priest can still speak that same high priest can still deliver can still heal can still fill with his presence amen because he's the same god hardly i'm so thankful we do not serve a god of history hallelujah i'm sure we can all have fellowship on this one he's alive amen he's living i mean he's president 2021 to guide us through the darkness i mean we don't have to worry a single day of our lives because he's got it all in control amen he had it in control when he commissioned moses to go down into egypt he had it in control where moses was talking to pharaoh he had it in control in the first place the second plague the third flag all the plagues he had in control when they left egypt he had to control when they crossed the red sea handed in control when they came to the bitter waters he only control when they came to mount sinai he under control when they went through moab he added control when they crossed the jordan he under control they took jericho he under control when they took ai he had to control when they took the whole land he had it in control all the way he had to control during the days of gideon hallelujah out of control down through the judges he had been controlled during saul's souls kingship davis kingship sullivan's kinship he added in control all the way down he added control when john the baptist was here when he was in flesh he really had it in control he had the church under his control of the day of pentecost and he still has a bride under control i mean and he's in control of every situation i mean we don't need to worry he has it all in control i mean sarah had to come to a place because of a visitation she judged him faithful that he was able to do the promise hallelujah and we are that same woman hallelujah hallelujah maybe you've been waiting for a promise amen but the visitation's on hallelujah remember she was in the brother abraham said i was listening today he said you know sarah was a bit fussy because there are reports you know they were living on the plains of memory it wasn't the well-watered plains of sodom and so the cattle didn't have enough food and you know the wells were going dry and there was strife amongst the herdsmen because their animals were getting skinnier and you know um sarah saw lots wife and her fancy dresses that they had inside him all these different things but abraham was under expectation hallelujah because he was under expectation that a visitation was on its way that the king of glory was going to come meet him hallelujah and so he just kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere i know i said it on sunday but you know the more the trouble comes it's the devil trying to rob you of the visitation of the angel hallelujah so the worst things get hallelujah hallelujah i mean i've got trouble in my body hallelujah there's strife in the family glory works turning upside down hallelujah to god why because god is the devil trying to block a visitation i remember we just keep walking with god remember the god who gave the promise is the same god that manifests the promise it's not you and i that's going to make a rapture happen he's going to rapture us well that's just what we give ourselves to that's the main thing i mean if you give yourself to unbelief you will receive what unbelief produces but if you give yourself to faith you give yourself to the word amen that that word will be produced in your life amen hallelujah amen amen amen let me more say today my brother sister in this present day when crisis and when cancer is eating the world up and diseases of all kind the same historical god that cleans the leper healed the sick and raise the dead as the same god today he's waiting anxiously for his people to call him on the scene of action he loves to be called on the scene hallelujah the one who could forgive a harlot for committing adultery seven times in a day he who could cleanse the vilest sinner and make them white as a lily that same god of history lives today to clean every blackened heart of sin and unbelief hallelujah he's the same god today we don't serve a god of the past we serve a god of the present and he is alive he's very much alive hallelujah if we really you know if we really sat down and and maybe the musicians if you just want to come but if we really sat down and had a testimony service if we really did i mean and and there wasn't a time restriction and we just took the last however many years we'd be here a long time we'd be here a really long time because he has done so much and what is that a god of history came into the present hallelujah hallelujah and he's the same god today and he's not here you know what he wants us to you know what he wants us to do he wants us just to fully trust him he wants to lift us up hallelujah you know you know what he wants to do you know what he is doing right now he's taking you he's saying satan this is i'm just this is you basically because you're the word made flesh you're a living epistle he says satan she's standing she's standing in faith satan you can't stop it you tried you tried just like with job you tried but you failed amen he he trusted in me though he had no idea what was going on here's a group at the end time they're manifesting me i live in them you can't stop them devil and you won't be able to stop them hallelujah you know it's like you're a little kid you say no no no no no you know i'm not calling god a little kid but god wants to prove the prove to the devil you failed in the beginning you fell all the way down you thought you had the believer down through but no no they got out amen even in the dark ages that was all obtained by god that wasn't the devil getting something over god no no god ordained it jesus said unless a corn of wheat falls to the ground and abides alone whatever does it comes with brings forth much fruit at all he wasn't just speaking of himself he's bringing a bright church down through seven church ages so you know did you have let ain't got nothing on god right hallelujah remember we are his victory we are his crowning achievement hallelujah hallelujah and it's all his doing it's all him it's not us it's him hallelujah you know if we had a testimony service in heaven i think it all boiled down to he got me here doesn't matter what age a martyr in the martyr ages in the dark ages whatever age he got me here he put something in my heart amen you know peter would have said you know i was a jellyfish when pressure came on but i met him hallelujah and he even prophesied that i'd be crucified i wasn't a coward i gave it i just had to there's just something in me hallelujah and all the
