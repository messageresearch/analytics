[0:00] don't make his life miserable without it
[0:01] sir that you that's like his service to
[0:04] you is grief hey like it's burdensome
[0:06] because he says that they may do it with
[0:09] joy and not with grief for that is
[0:12] unprofitable for you now I want to tell
[0:17] you the most basic of things that you
[0:19] can do for your pastor
[0:20] this is the most basic of things you
[0:22] want to know what the most this is now
[0:23] this is coming from a pastoral
[0:24] experience right the most basic of
[0:27] things is when he gets up here
[0:29] on Sunday morning and he sees and post
[0:31] sitting me you know makes him feel good
[0:33] he's like yes brother umph oh you know
[0:36] you think about Hermes put all this
[0:38] effort in he's put all this effort this
[0:39] is this is a labor of love for the Lord
[0:41] he's put all this effort and he together
[0:43] people and to speak of the things of God
[0:45] in to build people up into and he
[0:47] prepares his message you need tools on
[0:49] things throughout the week and he's
[0:51] thinking what could I what can I speak
[0:52] to the Brethren this week where's the
[0:54] Spirit of God leading me and I just want
[0:56] them to be closer to you and and I
[0:58] desire that how can i how can I help
[1:01] them how can I courage him I want to see
[1:02] them built up that's as hard as hard as
[1:05] pure pure towards you and when he sees
[1:09] you're sitting in the and then the
[1:11] church on Sunday morning it makes them
[1:14] feel real good is the Lord brother Perry
[1:19] greens that if you love God you've tuned
[1:20] up to church on Sunday morning and if
[1:24] you love your church you'll turn up to
[1:26] church on Sunday night you're ready for
[1:29] it and if you love your pastor you'll
[1:30] tune up to church on Wednesday night you
[1:32] know because the pastor's that all of
[1:34] them so as God so as the church always
[1:37] there but you know it makes them feel
[1:38] good because it he needs support you
[1:44] know now one of the important important
[1:47] things about a pasta is respecting him
[1:49] and one of the important things is know
[1:54] that's very very important I'm gonna
[1:58] throw a little thing out there respect
[2:00] them enough that even if he's wrong
[2:02] sometimes give him grace
[2:05] make sure the level of respect goes
[2:07] higher than oh well if you get something
[2:08] wrong then you know that like to me that
[2:10] respect was sort of down here somewhere
[2:12] but you know pastors don't get
[2:13] everything right that do we know that's
[2:16] the truth right we have to do I get
[2:18] everything right no do you know will it
[2:22] pass there no there are some situations
[2:25] he has to deal with and make decisions
[2:27] and we are here is to pick the best of
[2:29] four bad options each one's going to
[2:32] make him look bad you know when when
[2:34] when human beings get in pickles and
[2:37] situations and and in permissive wool
[2:41] situations things get messy you know and
[2:44] the poor past is sitting here you know
[2:46] he's he sometimes he's caught up on this
[2:48] and he's he's got four bad options to
[2:50] take what options does he take either
[2:53] one he's gonna look bad but but always
[2:56] respect them you know and if you respect
[2:59] her men and encourage them thanks for
[3:02] that message I enjoyed that I you know
[3:04] I've really enjoyed that thank you for
[3:05] this and encourage them in and your mind
[3:08] respect him there's a supernatural
[3:09] element to that that makes them feel at
[3:11] liberty and makes them feel like he can
[3:13] lead you know because if you if there's
[3:17] a if the respect is gone
[3:19] it's it breaks something up and it just
[3:22] makes them loop makes them lose the
[3:24] confidence to lead oh they don't really
[3:27] like me anymore maybe of maybe I'm a bit
[3:29] washed up you know it and it's Satan's
[3:31] that's playing on it and they and it can
[3:34] hinder their their ministry to us so
[3:38] always be respectful to the pastor hold
[3:41] him in high esteem he's got a very
[3:43] serious job to do but lean adult with
[3:45] joy be nice to me happy you know why not
[3:47] think about what it is to be in his
[3:49] shoes you know help him out like John do
[3:52] whatever you can God will bless us if we
[3:54] respect our pastor guarantee it I can
[3:57] guarantee it I've been in the position
[3:58] went yeah the way and it was terrible
[4:00] but if we just bless our pastor and
[4:02] always be respectful God can move and
[4:05] God even see it if you if you do it the
[4:06] other way you know then I'll take the
[4:08] candlestick away he concealed take it
[4:10] away if we pastors are actually quite
[4:11] delicate a real pastors quite a delicate
[4:13] person too
[4:14] he's not a generally not a you know he
[4:17] doesn't have a lot of thick skin ease
[4:18] very open very I know he learns to be a
[4:20] bit but looks good after a while but you
[4:23] know so that's our that's our first one
[4:26] is to really respect our posture and the
[4:28] the the leadership and if you ever have
[4:32] negative thoughts about your posture
[4:34] quickly deal with them because because
[4:37] that's the first step and things all
[4:39] breaking down all around us is that but
[4:42] I can guarantee if we do it the other
[4:43] way if we really respect our posture and
[4:45] as unto the Lord and think Lord I want
[4:48] to receive from you through this you
[4:49] know the Lord we respect the Lord but
[4:52] you know respecting the past there is
[4:53] actually as unto the Lord God will move
[4:55] okay now here's another very very
[4:58] important my number two step number two
[5:03] equally important respect each other
[5:06] equally important brother Ben has
[5:11] preached about it quite a lot but we get
[5:14] to know people in the flesh and the more
[5:17] you get to know so on in the flesh the
[5:19] more you realize how much of an actual
[5:20] kind of failure they kind of are you
[5:22] might have thought that once pretty
[5:23] quite an awesome guy you know that's the
[5:26] truth as you get to know them you're
[5:28] like man that guy's got a lot more flaws
[5:30] than I thought hey and when I start
[5:34] thinking that about my friends I think
[5:36] oh no they're thinking the same about me
[5:38] hey and the unfortunate thing about me
[5:42] as I can't see my own flaws and I think
[5:43] I'm the best thing out what we all do
[5:45] right hey let's be honest you know hey
[5:50] that's the way that's the way that it is
[5:52] you know we you know because we we're
[5:54] not we're not really gonna think we're
[5:56] really no good otherwise and we're gonna
[5:59] have confidence and the things that the
[6:01] way we think of the things that we do
[6:02] otherwise if we didn't have confidence
[6:03] and then we wouldn't do then we didn't
[6:05] think they were the greatest choices
[6:07] that we wouldn't make than me I've made
[6:08] a good choice here that's the truth
[6:11] right but but we get to a place with the
[6:14] believers with the Brethren they become
[6:17] someone mystical that you don't quite
[6:19] know to someone that you know to someone
[6:20] that eyes doing that again hey now avoid
[6:25] that thought right
[6:27] our job as believers as to as to the
[6:31] she ate the two right because the flesh
[6:36] man and the spirit man are two different
[6:38] things and some of us are some of us
[6:41] swing between these two a lot more than
[6:42] others you know some of us kind of have
[6:44] a hard time here then we come up here
[6:45] and we you know now our aim than serving
[6:48] the Lord is that we might come and be
[6:49] that our flesh may be more and more a
[6:51] subjection than our our way that we are
[6:53] would come more and along with her
[6:55] spirit man and yet we've got the fish
[6:57] man that Conner you know we're all on
[7:00] this journey trying to make these two
[7:01] combined you know to be so you generally
[7:03] see the spirit man more than all the
[7:05] time that's the purpose of the teaching
[7:07] and molding of the Lord right but this
[7:09] is flesh this natural man that is kind
[7:12] of annoying sometimes Hey
[7:14] he's kind of predictable sometimes he's
[7:17] he's frustrating sometimes you know
[7:21] that's the truth right don't act on that
[7:25] don't act on that whatsoever
[7:27] you know just rush it aside now if they
[7:29] do these things brush it aside but don't
[7:32] react and the flesh to anyone it's what
[7:35] they said about the Corinthians they
[7:36] you're not comma ylim Walker's mean you
[7:37] know they were you had these two men
[7:39] sort of walking on the flesh and they
[7:40] were just having all this bickering in
[7:41] the flesh and he's doing this doing that
[7:44] you know it's if we want God to move
[7:47] amongst us then we've got to look past
[7:49] that and no matter how long you've known
[7:52] some someone that so-and-so as a son or
[7:54] daughter of God and they have the
[7:56] ability to be led by the Spirit of God
[7:57] and and we've got to have a confidence
[8:00] in their walk that's very important you
[8:03] know when you feel like someone's lost
[8:05] confidence in your Christian Christian
[8:06] walk it's very hard to get out of that
[8:09] sometimes Jana said it's hard because
[8:11] they when people have confidence and you
[8:14] you feel like yes I can I can trust it
[8:17] all I can be a Christian I can do this
[8:19] you know but as you as if someone loses
[8:22] confidence in your Christian walk it
[8:24] knocks you back now that can knock you
[8:27] back from serving the Lord it can it can
[8:28] hinder us and we don't want that in a
[8:31] fellowship we want to always respect the
[8:33] fact that actually sister Chantel can
[8:36] raise their hands and praise the Lord
[8:37] you know on one day she's probably going
[8:39] to break out into tongues and
[8:40] interpretation and that you know why not
[8:43] why not you see if we if we think oh
[8:46] this you guys again because we're not
[8:48] here for so many years then we won't get
[8:50] anything better please say Lord one day
[8:52] it's just going to move on from that you
[8:53] know then it's then then things will
[8:56] continue to happen as we look at the
[8:58] spirit man a woman rather than the
[9:00] natural man and always keep that in our
[9:01] minds and then and we'll be a fruitful
[9:05] body of Christ amen number three this is
[9:10] very very important when you're my feet
[9:15] these new batteries okay
[9:19] now if I've learned anything in my walk
[9:21] it's this one deal gently with each
[9:25] other
[9:26] gently I just found the scripture the
[9:29] other day this was not the one I was
[9:30] going to use but I actually enjoyed it
[9:33] so much that I put it here because it
[9:35] really speaks about this verse he that
[9:39] covereth a transgression seeketh love
[9:41] but he that repeated the matter
[9:43] separated fury friends
[9:44] I like that first but he that covereth
[9:48] the transgression seeketh love that's
[9:52] when you know something has happened you
[9:53] you you but you just you know something
[9:56] Bad's happy you know something that
[9:57] someone's done but you just sort of
[9:58] brush it aside and your deal gently now
[10:05] what I mean by dealing gently is let
[10:10] people make mistakes let them make
[10:12] mistakes to each other and to you let
[10:16] them make mistakes and don't just run in
[10:18] and mmm you know they were real gently
[10:21] there's a saying that says all's will
[10:24] walk with hobnail shoes where angels
[10:26] fear to tread now there may be a
[10:30] situation where God may be allowing
[10:33] something in someone's life and and he
[10:36] may be allowing them to do some sort of
[10:38] catastrophic failure somewhere because
[10:40] you've got a plan he's got an idea he's
[10:43] got something in mind for that person
[10:44] but he knows I've tried these other ways
[10:47] my son my daughter but unfortunately
[10:49] this is now the method I'm gonna have to
[10:51] use to just tweak this little piece
[10:53] that's a new he might bring them through
[10:57] maybe a bad situation but we have to
[11:02] believe that every situation that every
[11:04] brother and sister was going through is
[11:05] by the divine hand of God now if we
[11:07] respect them will understand that
[11:09] therefore if they're going through this
[11:12] situation or something like that and
[11:14] gods dealing you imagine if we come in
[11:17] and do our little deal in there you know
[11:19] and it's contrary to the to God's idea
[11:23] now we think well I've got the idea in
[11:25] the situation I kind of know this I'd
[11:27] need to go and tell them that because I
[11:28] know them well I've learnt that I
[11:30] actually don't know I don't know I'm not
[11:33] God why my knowledge on life is very
[11:36] very very limited the sphere of
[11:39] influence I have is a person that very
[11:40] limited ender the the my knowledge is I
[11:44] kind of know my wife okay my children
[11:47] year all right when it gets to anything
[11:49] outside of that I think this is getting
[11:51] way too complicated for me but our far
[11:54] too complicated who knows more than that
[11:56] like know like he even run at work you
[12:00] know every everyone you meet you kind of
[12:02] you're saying - no see God knows all of
[12:04] that and every every intricate situation
[12:07] involves and then every everything about
[12:10] every individual person and what they've
[12:11] been through where he's leading him
[12:13] everything he's got tools that he's
[12:16] using to mold and make the believers and
[12:20] I am very very cautious to get in a mess
[12:24] with that with God's work you know
[12:27] because I really don't know what's
[12:29] happening I don't know so we have to
[12:31] deal it's a very important thing I've
[12:33] learned that just to deal gently with
[12:35] the Brethren they'll deal very gently
[12:37] don't don't deal harshly we you know if
[12:43] he is a close friend and you can hey it
[12:45] was stupid
[12:46] yeah no bro you know if you know we can
[12:48] take it tell them but if you don't know
[12:50] the brother very well even if he's a
[12:52] brother if you haven't you haven't got a
[12:53] real strong human bond with them I just
[12:55] leave it alone many times I think look I
[12:57] don't know that person will know if I'm
[12:59] not going to say a single thing I don't
[13:00] know them they're a brother sister but I
[13:02] don't know them well enough I wouldn't
[13:04] dare go and say anything you know just
[13:06] be just deal gently very very important
[13:10] being God can work you know if we start
[13:12] yelling roughly and listen it will just
[13:14] cause will cause a mess and next one
[13:20] number four this is a very important
[13:24] moment be humble and be teachable be
[13:28] humble and be teachable we aren't very
[13:31] good in the body of Christ when we think
[13:32] we know everything and we think we're
[13:33] pretty good and we're kind of you know
[13:36] the more we realize that we don't know
[13:39] then the more we can be taught and the
[13:42] more we can actually be of a benefit to
[13:44] the kingdom of God the scripture says
[13:46] likewise ye younger submit yourselves
[13:47] unto the elder yay all of you be subject
[13:49] one to another and be clothed with
[13:51] humility for God resisteth the proud but
[13:52] giveth grace to the humble and to be of
[13:58] any asset in the body of Christ if we
[14:01] think we know a lot and we think we're
[14:03] pretty good we think we're quite a good
[14:05] asset then God's got a bit of dealing in
[14:10] our lives to Humble us down to where we
[14:12] have to realize we actually don't know
[14:14] that much I'm not I'm not as great a guy
[14:18] as what I thought I was and I just need
[14:20] all the help that I can get that true
[14:24] hey be humble and be teachable you know
[14:28] we when we think we know it all is when
[14:31] we make all the mistakes when I was
[14:32] younger I knew your whole lot more than
[14:33] what I do now you know and you're a
[14:35] whole lot more don't know where it's all
[14:36] gone you know you supposed to get
[14:38] smarter over the years you know I've
[14:39] kind of know less and this and this you
[14:40] know when they're when all the Pharisees
[14:45] are going to throw the stones at the the
[14:47] woman that was caught in adultery you
[14:50] notice who left first when Jesus wrote
[14:52] on the gun who left first all the older
[14:55] guys they're like actually no no no no
[14:57] yep I don't know anything about this I'm
[14:59] out of here the last ones to leave young
[15:01] guys kind of know mm-hmm in a little
[15:05] while longer to realize no you don't
[15:06] know either
[15:07] you know that doesn't mean when you're
[15:09] old you're humble abut you know as you
[15:10] go along in life if the Lord deals with
[15:13] you you do get humbler and you realize I
[15:14] don't know much
[15:15] I don't know much at all and I'm just
[15:17] reliant on the grace and mercy of God
[15:19] I'm relying on him if a young brother
[15:22] wants to tell me I'm alone
[15:24] tell me you know hmm you know what when
[15:26] you're like that till you can take it
[15:27] you can take a look you can take a lot
[15:29] of rebuking you take a lot of things you
[15:30] know it doesn't matter you rebuke a wise
[15:32] man have you made wiser
[15:33] you know you think I'm stupid at that
[15:36] really man thanks for telling me I
[15:38] didn't cause I was is that's the truth
[15:40] right you didn't man yeah I actually am
[15:43] well thanks now but wiser don't do that
[15:45] anymore you know but if you rebuke a
[15:48] fool you'll hate you for it and a fall
[15:50] is quite a prideful person tell him
[15:51] something he's all upset I shouldn't be
[15:53] telling me I'm awesome at plants
[15:55] courtesy and he's no good you know
[15:58] and you got to sort of tread delicately
[15:59] and you know it's all this everything
[16:00] you do is all friction and you know it's
[16:02] just with yelling with pride here the
[16:05] more humbler we become the more we just
[16:06] you know we can be told and pushed
[16:08] around and listened it doesn't bother us
[16:09] no yeah you know and then we become an
[16:13] amiable nice member in the body we can
[16:15] just be you know we're not gonna get
[16:16] worked up over things
[16:17] hey most of the things you say about me
[16:20] badly right you know probably a lot more
[16:23] you don't know about you know by the
[16:25] grace of God hey I'm glad he's got me
[16:29] okay now here's another important one
[16:33] you charge them slightly we get into a
[16:38] spiritual side and a fellowship right
[16:40] which is rule over your own flesh very
[16:42] important in a fellowship let's want to
[16:44] read this one from first Peter 4 verse 1
[16:46] to 2 it says for as much seen as Christ
[16:47] has suffered for us in the flesh arm
[16:49] yourselves likewise with the same mind
[16:51] well he did has suffered in the flesh
[16:53] has ceased from sin that he should no
[16:55] longer look for the rest of his time in
[16:56] the flesh to the lusts of men but to the
[16:58] will of God now I like an each person in
[17:02] a fellowship and the body of Christ to a
[17:05] part of the wall we're all a part of the
[17:08] wall right and we have a responsibility
[17:11] to defend our part of the wall and that
[17:15] that that wall is our flesh because the
[17:17] devil own can only work through our
[17:19] flesh really he can't the devil can't
[17:21] work through the Holy Ghost he doesn't
[17:25] have you know he can only work through
[17:27] through our flesh through our own and
[17:30] human spirit and our own thoughts that
[17:33] are not in line with the Word of God
[17:35] that's we can work he can't work in the
[17:37] thought
[17:37] the Word of God cuz that's the Word of
[17:39] God that's why brother MCS it can't be
[17:41] you can't impersonate this like you
[17:44] can't impersonate that the true Holy
[17:46] Ghost it is the Holy Ghost it's the real
[17:48] thing itself right but but it's L it's
[17:51] our responsibility and a fellowship as
[17:55] to guard our piece of the wall to ensure
[17:58] that we don't get let down our guard and
[18:01] then the enemy comes in through us and
[18:04] starts messing around and fellowship
[18:06] because we can do that I can I can make
[18:08] my guard down and just beats that
[18:10] walking in the flesh and then I might
[18:12] start doing things that wouldn't
[18:13] otherwise doing start influencing my
[18:14] friends and the fellowship to to do
[18:17] things that they wouldn't otherwise do
[18:18] because I'm their friend and I this is
[18:19] still one sproates all right you
[18:21] understand or I could start to get
[18:23] negative on things in start to get all
[18:25] carnal and start to say hurtful and
[18:29] nasty things to people that I wouldn't
[18:31] otherwise say or say things about people
[18:33] that I wouldn't otherwise say and it
[18:35] starts this negative venom ticking
[18:40] through the fellowship and it's not I
[18:43] need it that's not really me but I
[18:45] haven't ruled over my flesh and I've let
[18:48] this thing come in and now I'm kind of
[18:50] you know I'm affecting the fellowship
[18:51] you know there's a sign I think on
[18:53] brother I'll raise you a quote from
[18:55] brother Brennan that says I'm you know
[18:57] our attitude someone help me just been
[19:00] there our attitude your attitude towards
[19:03] someone else could determine the eternal
[19:05] outcome I believe is the is the quote
[19:09] now I think this all ties together
[19:12] because if we if we are acting in the
[19:15] spirit and situations then I believe
[19:16] we'll do the right thing and and if we
[19:20] just keep if we keep the the enemy out
[19:24] of our own life and we just think the
[19:26] Spirit of God work through us through
[19:27] the fellowship then it will all be
[19:29] alright attitude towards people will be
[19:30] right so so we all have to roll over at
[19:34] our own part of the wall no one can do
[19:37] it for you nobody can do it for you and
[19:39] I'm relying on you you're relying on me
[19:41] if brother imposes on the other side of
[19:43] the wall fighting over there I'm relying
[19:44] that he's going to be holding his part
[19:45] of the wall because I can't I gotta look
[19:47] after my part you know okay
[19:49] after his part and if he doesn't we all
[19:51] suffer not like your brother I'm gonna
[19:52] put on me if I don't we all suffer he's
[19:55] humble enough you'll take it he's such a
[19:58] smiley guy like him when you smile
[20:01] you've got energy you know
[20:03] we walked at the top of that hill where
[20:05] the wind was blowing the most amazing
[20:06] one you've ever felt in your life at the
[20:08] top of the rumor take a hill and you
[20:09] can't even stand at the top and then
[20:11] pose up there laughing laughter makes
[20:15] you young and vibrant we're all over
[20:19] your own flesh next one this goes with
[20:22] it but now this is now the positive side
[20:24] of it we filled with the spirit be
[20:27] filled with the Spirit of God if you
[20:28] want to be a channel of blessing to the
[20:31] fellowship and just everywhere you go
[20:32] you're just pouring out life be filled
[20:34] with the Spirit of God make an effort to
[20:35] be filled with the spirit and make your
[20:37] life tender and soft and just the Holy
[20:40] Ghost just living out through you the
[20:42] more we do that the more you'll get
[20:43] there the rest of the fellowship on fire
[20:45] just by being just did just making an
[20:48] effort to be filled with the Spirit of
[20:50] God as there's so much of the Spirit of
[20:51] God to be had it's often us that
[20:53] restrict it be filled with the Spirit of
[20:55] God if we live in the spirit let us also
[20:57] walk in the spirit be filled with the
[20:59] Spirit of God we're all over your flesh
[21:01] to me filled with the spirit your pastor
[21:04] will love you
[21:05] he'll love you can we you'll be as
[21:08] favorite he wants to be the pastor's
[21:09] favorite come on well what's the
[21:15] scripture there's a scripture about you
[21:19] know we provoke one another to good
[21:21] works right we so this is like a
[21:24] competition who's going to be the
[21:25] pastor's pit but actually the Lord will
[21:28] be happy you know the Lord is well
[21:29] pleased when we when we were when we
[21:31] were amiable a good part of the body you
[21:37] know the Lord's actually the Lord is
[21:38] pleased with that he has the he has
[21:40] emotions he and there's a it can be he
[21:44] always loves us but he has emotions I'm
[21:45] happy with that I'm not happy with the
[21:46] head you know and he can be pleased with
[21:49] how we operate and you know when we get
[21:51] full with the Spirit of God the more we
[21:54] get filled with the Spirit of God the
[21:55] less I think we'd do things wrong and
[21:56] the more we act in the in the Spirit of
[21:59] God and in the right spirit then I think
[22:01] that the more
[22:02] white will be in situations when we act
[22:05] in the in the through the spirit of God
[22:07] now we all know when that is right this
[22:09] be honest with ourselves we all know
[22:11] when reacting in the flesh they when we
[22:13] like worked up over saying we know I
[22:15] know I've just learned these days that
[22:18] when I get like that I think man I I
[22:19] just and I fail all the time but I think
[22:21] man I've got a hmm I can't when I get
[22:24] like that shut my mouth don't do
[22:26] anything don't say anything don't don't
[22:28] make any choices don't do anything just
[22:30] get yourself right first and then you'll
[22:32] start making the right decisions again
[22:34] and saying the right things this and
[22:36] that past that we just thought get away
[22:38] on me but I fail all the time but by
[22:41] God's grace he points out where I fouled
[22:43] and next time I say right bring it on
[22:44] again on it don't have another garlis
[22:46] you know I don't be full with the spirit
[22:49] and often I can trace it back to the
[22:50] list of the Spirit I had then the more I
[22:54] was prone to do that now that's not
[22:55] saying the Holy Ghost comes and goes in
[22:57] your life but there's a that more we
[22:59] give time to the Lord the more of the
[23:00] measure of Christ's and more of the
[23:02] influence of the Holy Ghost can be in
[23:03] our life and the more effective and soft
[23:06] we can be here's another one let the
[23:11] Word of God dwell in you richly there's
[23:14] this may seem like they're all part of
[23:16] the other ones but it's actually it's
[23:18] these are there's this word of God that
[23:22] directs our life and gives us answers
[23:24] and situations thy word have a head and
[23:27] one heart that I might not sin against
[23:29] thee David's adore thy word is a lamp
[23:30] unto my feet and a light unto my path
[23:32] therefore the more of this word that we
[23:34] know and we endeavor to have it dwelling
[23:37] in our hearts in each situation we can
[23:39] it's it's fresh and alive in our mind
[23:41] and we can actually think in the
[23:44] situation the Word of God comes up and
[23:45] yes this is the right thing that I
[23:46] should do here because the Word of God
[23:48] is dwelling in us richly it's it's
[23:50] vibrant it's in our mind now if we don't
[23:53] give that attention when a situation
[23:54] comes up we have a there's a plenty of
[23:56] other thoughts that could take its place
[23:57] and that we could act on but if we let
[23:59] the Word of God dwell on us richly as
[24:01] Colossians 3:16 says let the Word of God
[24:04] of Christ dwell in you richly in all
[24:05] wisdom teaching and admonishing one
[24:07] another in Psalms and hymns and
[24:09] spiritual songs singing with grace in
[24:11] your hearts to the Lord daily will I
[24:14] meditate upon thee
[24:16] and meditations of her heart and often
[24:19] with me you know I'm if I be about
[24:21] slackens area I think man it's been I'm
[24:23] sort of been chewing on this one for a
[24:24] while now you know it's thumb bike I
[24:26] need to get some more to chew on you
[24:28] know that's just me right I need to get
[24:31] I think that I've been I've been chewing
[24:33] this not that the word gets old but you
[24:35] know this is this new manner to behead
[24:36] in our life you know and we should boys
[24:38] but if the word of God dwelling in us
[24:39] richly this will make us act different
[24:42] amongst their body of believers and make
[24:44] us act different it'll make us make the
[24:46] right choices here we go this one here
[24:57] now now we're all still done we're doing
[24:59] the we're doing the Christian thing
[25:01] where you know this one's very very
[25:05] important in the body of Christ love
[25:08] your life for Christ not for yourself
[25:11] live your life for Christ I want to read
[25:14] mark 12:29 2td says and jesus answered
[25:16] him the first of all the commandment
[25:17] says hear o Israel the Lord our God is
[25:19] one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord
[25:21] thy God with all thy heart with all thy
[25:23] soul with all thy mind and with all thy
[25:25] strength this is the first commandment
[25:27] you tell me what other functionality the
[25:30] human being has a slope from the most
[25:32] four things pretty much everything that
[25:35] we our mortal existence has wrapped up
[25:38] into our heart our soul our mind and our
[25:41] strength when you boil each thing down I
[25:43] can't see any other area where we can
[25:45] where we don't need to love the Lord
[25:47] from it pretty much encompasses the
[25:49] human being but I want to labor on this
[25:51] one for a little bit because it's so
[25:55] important it's so important that we
[25:59] don't focus we don't get caught up in
[26:01] the cares of this life and the
[26:03] deceitfulness of riches that can choke
[26:06] the word we were just talking about that
[26:07] word wants to come out and do things
[26:11] grow multiply and once they're
[26:15] multiplied it's all there you know we're
[26:16] right there we're ready to multiply but
[26:20] the Bible says the cares of this life
[26:21] and the deceitfulness of riches come in
[26:24] and they choke the word inhibit that
[26:25] becomes unfruitful and it's so easy
[26:28] who knows what a care of this life is
[26:30] basically everything we do on a daily
[26:32] basis to survive we're not talking bad
[26:37] things are we we're talking I got to go
[26:39] to work I got to do this I got it there
[26:41] and they've got to do Korea go do all
[26:42] these things you know just a care of
[26:44] this life it's all of us and the
[26:47] deceitfulness of riches and and you know
[26:53] just as this is just my thought but I
[26:55] decided in my life and my service to the
[26:58] Lord I'm gonna take a risk you know I'm
[27:00] gonna risk it all I'm gonna risk it all
[27:03] it might sound strange but I'm gonna
[27:06] risk it all for the Lord I'm just gonna
[27:07] I'm gonna give him more and have no
[27:09] other options if it all doesn't work
[27:11] I've got no plan B well this is it you
[27:17] know we need it we need to check our
[27:20] lives that were actually that we are not
[27:24] getting caught up in our own interests
[27:28] and our own interests and our own
[27:30] desires and I'm not talking these are
[27:34] bad things these are what we perceive as
[27:35] good things but you know I wonder
[27:40] sometimes whether whether we actually
[27:42] you know we get to this point and then
[27:44] we we get a bit older and then we
[27:46] realize we've got to sort of look after
[27:48] our future and sort things out and we
[27:51] start going off and then you know our
[27:53] focus can go they may have children so
[27:55] they now all our focus starts to shift
[27:57] off the things of God and off his work
[28:01] on to all these kids of life that seems
[28:03] so good but it's so easy to get
[28:05] sidetracked on those who's heard the
[28:08] prophecy that brother nibel gave it's
[28:10] actually not on this on some of the
[28:12] sermons but the pec that I've got it's
[28:14] on it's that of a sermon and I want to
[28:19] tell you this I've always thought in my
[28:23] mind Lord my life is going to be serving
[28:26] you and doing your work whatever it
[28:28] might be if I have get married if I have
[28:31] children if I do all these things
[28:32] they're not going to be my I'm not going
[28:35] to have children they're settled in and
[28:36] right let's just focus on my family and
[28:38] get things all you know I said
[28:40] unfortunate old shed in the early early
[28:42] days my life's not going to be like
[28:43] it's not gonna just my attention is not
[28:46] going to get diverted even though I've
[28:47] got a responsibility it's not all my
[28:48] responsibility I just want to say this
[28:52] how I feel about it I know that requires
[28:54] that much but it doesn't require that
[28:55] much and it will take that much if I
[28:58] give it to it my career will take that
[29:00] much if I give it to it everything all
[29:02] these kids it's life there's no limit to
[29:03] what they will take the only limit
[29:06] they've got is what I give it I say I'll
[29:08] give you this much and no more that's
[29:09] all you get you you get a much no more
[29:11] and if you don't give it amounts to say
[29:14] that's all you can get and if you feel
[29:16] it's taken too much and that's and it
[29:17] needs that much say Lord I don't want to
[29:18] give this thing that much change it so I
[29:21] can give it this so I can actually give
[29:22] you enough so that the work can be
[29:25] fruitful in my life there's the quote
[29:29] that the old save us thee because based
[29:33] on that always thought that way but I
[29:34] thought I'm like correcting this or am I
[29:35] kind of like you know going wee bit
[29:37] crazy and then I hear a not a quote it
[29:40] was a tongues and interpretations and it
[29:42] was brother Neville speaking when will
[29:46] the Lord speaking through brother neva
[29:47] when he interpreted and there must have
[29:48] been a young minister and the meetings
[29:50] and he said young Minister there was a
[29:52] time when you were in the temple serving
[29:53] God and you were doing these things and
[29:55] now you've you've got yourself a family
[29:58] now you're sitting down settling down
[29:59] into family life and you're just you're
[30:01] not really caring for the things of God
[30:02] anymore and it was rebuked to this young
[30:05] Minister that his life had slowly become
[30:07] focused just on his family and on all
[30:09] these other maybe his career because
[30:10] he's got to buy the children bikes and
[30:12] christmas is coming up and now need to
[30:14] build them a little house out the back
[30:16] and you know I've got to take them out
[30:18] on a Saturday and do this and do that
[30:19] and you know let's nail it and it kind
[30:23] of you know before you know it it was
[30:24] taking up all of his time and the Word
[30:26] of God couldn't take root and flourish
[30:28] anymore now that's not being crazy
[30:31] because we only get to live once we only
[30:35] get one shot at the Saints you get one
[30:37] shot you lay down on your grave when
[30:40] you're old and you lie down and you
[30:41] think what did i do what did I give you
[30:44] get one shot one shot something could
[30:48] take years from your life and was it
[30:49] worth all those years years of focused
[30:51] years of energy I focus for years on a
[30:54] certain thing and I look back with
[30:55] regret
[30:57] because it was just a natural business
[30:58] and natural thing I look back with
[31:00] regret and I think why that cost me
[31:01] years of energy of enthusiasm of this
[31:05] time and gave me nothing on a lady on on
[31:09] my deathbed and think lord I gave
[31:12] everything that I could I live my life
[31:14] different I lived it different I didn't
[31:17] care about those things I didn't care
[31:19] about my career I don't care about all
[31:20] these Lord I was I took risks I risk it
[31:24] all for you lord I risked it all now
[31:28] that's what they did in the book of Acts
[31:29] we never convicted they risked at all
[31:31] the raptures coming the coming of the
[31:33] Lord is knowing we're so busy burning up
[31:35] our future here think about it now we
[31:39] can be wise as we get older but there's
[31:40] a point where we've got to put off even
[31:42] our carnal wisdom and think I just don't
[31:44] want to get stuck in that rut but I want
[31:46] to get stuck in that rut I only get one
[31:47] life I get one chance to to give all my
[31:50] talents for the Lord I get one chance
[31:52] this is it
[31:53] look around you real live this is it we
[31:55] get one chance no more chances after
[31:57] this we get one and their life is like a
[31:59] vapor like a flower comes up and goes
[32:01] down what is it worth some of these
[32:04] other things that we do sometimes I
[32:05] think to myself what's it all worth I
[32:07] want to go down to the grave saying Lord
[32:09] I gave it all for you and I felt me to
[32:12] do this thing and I pursued it I felt
[32:15] there was your calling for me and I
[32:17] pursued it I had a talent and I and I
[32:20] fought hard and rushed off these other
[32:22] things and restricted them so that this
[32:24] talent could come forth and serve you I
[32:26] could I could invest it back into you I
[32:28] invested him that when I saw it was a
[32:30] gift I had in my life I worked on that
[32:33] that's the truth we get one chance I've
[32:37] got two more next one give give and it
[32:46] shall be given unto you good measure
[32:48] pressed down and shaken together running
[32:50] over shall men give into your bosom for
[32:51] the same measure you meet well what's
[32:54] the same measure that you meet with all
[32:56] that shall be measured to you again yo
[32:59] yo don't be stingy in anything yeah
[33:04] give love give things give stuff give
[33:09] encouragement give help give time give
[33:11] be a giver be a channel of blessing be a
[33:16] giver when you're in a fellowship be a
[33:19] giver how can I help you know when I
[33:21] talk about these things the more you
[33:23] live your life like this at least you
[33:24] got time to complain about things right
[33:26] give how can I give in the situation
[33:28] don't be a taker takers thinking oh this
[33:30] is no good what can i you know because
[33:32] they're theater if you're at a place to
[33:33] take you're gonna be you're gonna think
[33:35] well that wasn't really what I wanted
[33:37] today I'm not happy if your mentality is
[33:40] to take what can I give to me I'm
[33:42] waiting it wasn't quite what I wanted
[33:44] but if we think what can I give when we
[33:47] clean up to a fellowship what can I give
[33:49] anytime you see a need you're gonna want
[33:51] to go oh I can maybe help there maybe I
[33:53] can do this when you've got the
[33:55] different mentality when we think to be
[33:58] a giver not a taker and a fellowship but
[34:00] it changes the whole way we look at
[34:01] something like I think often times if I
[34:03] see I wouldn't call it a problem at a
[34:05] PHY see a situation that needs a
[34:06] solution I think look I'm not prepared
[34:09] to go and do anything about it then my
[34:10] mouth stays shut about it if I'm not
[34:12] going to be a solution then I'm not
[34:13] going to be part of the problem and just
[34:15] complain if I'm not going to be a
[34:17] solution
[34:18] you know if someone else is doing
[34:20] something and I if I think more I can do
[34:22] that better within either go and do it
[34:23] or don't say anything if you're not
[34:25] going to be a solution right but but
[34:29] just don't be afraid to give give give
[34:31] the Lord loves a cheerful Giver
[34:34] but it keeps us young keeps us vibrant
[34:37] it keeps us you agree with it give give
[34:42] me some as white people have a problem
[34:46] giving sometimes you know the Englishmen
[34:48] they they try and give give
[34:54] hey you got a breakthrough cultural
[34:56] things sometimes the more we give the
[35:01] more we receive the more we give that
[35:03] it's inexhaustible if we just the Lord
[35:05] said the measure that you meet what if
[35:06] you give out you'll get it all back you
[35:07] see someone is just that open conjure
[35:09] they just seem to be pouring out with
[35:11] all sorts of stuff you don't think where
[35:12] does it all come from but the more we're
[35:14] a conduit for anything that's the Lord
[35:16] just wants to just bless and know so if
[35:18] we go like this
[35:19] there's no flowing going on there
[35:21] there's nothing happening but you know
[35:23] the more we just give the more we
[35:25] received and the more we can give we can
[35:26] just be a blessing if we live our life
[35:28] like this you know we just the Lord can
[35:30] really start to work and he can give
[35:31] back to us and we can give out and it's
[35:33] just we're and we can just all be a
[35:34] blessing in whatever manner we've got to
[35:36] just you know could just be a torrent of
[35:38] fountains everywhere from every person
[35:40] yeah people tell Christina Christi give
[35:44] us too much you know stop put a lid on
[35:51] it but I've always said don't put a lid
[35:54] on it no no way man okay there this is
[35:58] my last important point the young people
[36:02] here we're going new doesn't mean much
[36:03] the old people will go yet stay fervent
[36:06] stay zealous and stay youthful stay
[36:10] fervent zealous and youthful I took the
[36:12] scripture from Caleb another one lady
