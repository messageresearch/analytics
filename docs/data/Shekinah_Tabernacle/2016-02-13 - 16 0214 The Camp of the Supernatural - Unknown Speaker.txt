========================================

i wish the lord would just bring it back um and my mom was standing up amen with her hands in there and for yay for her it's hard but she defied gravity amen she made a choice and all the devils around her had to flee well she stood up and said but i don't want this anymore and she's here and nothing we said or done on that camp could have changed it god had to come down god had to do the work amen and that's what broke everything on that campus we didn't do anything there we were in opposition we were walking we were praising the lord focusing on him but he had to come and do it yeah and that's saturday night with our sunday night when we were praising and worshipping that was a big night for us guys that was where the lord said i'm pleased with you he doesn't come in and visit if he's not pleased amen and because we were able i mean you we were jumping around for joy and i was sitting there and i thought like we could walk into eternity right now we can seriously walk because there's nothing holding us back but we should keep that walk because just the next week when we get back then satan comes back oh yeah but are you good enough are you sure that is going to hold you is this is this the next battle push on let's just push on hey man like john shared brother and i i appreciate it you know mine was also my temperament and and i don't think sometimes when i say stuff and then lord brings it back and says shut up this is not don't say anything if you don't say anything good just keep quiet focus on me and walk on amen because you're going to rob someone else from a blessing because your attitude is bad and so i listened to the adoption series yesterday when i was driving up to kapiti and it's exactly the same there was one in the cab one in the camp that took the i think it was a a bracelet and and and 13 people died or 16 people had to die yeah because of one man yeah and i said lord i don't want to be that man yeah so i'll turn my face back to you and i say forgive me for my secret faults i'll walk on i'll just walk on and and i just pray that that would be attitude this year just amen everything that that tries to derail you just walk through it amen just walk through it it's not easy but just keep on walking man because it can it can rob someone from a blessing and you know what we were that we and we all were a blessing to everyone because our attitude was fixed on god thank you so praise the lord for that weekend he changed my life my whole outlook my life changed this weekend and then he takes you through a trial the next week just to say yeah i taught you something this weekend i'm forgetting already and then you say sorry god and you just walk on yeah so yeah just praise the lord i think we can give the lord so okay so we all know the captain of the host is right one thing i was very thankful on the camp that i realized is that physically we were not in the army or we didn't have to do any service here because if that guy at the back was my sergeant major when he when he got up it was a saturday morning that you that you brought the word i just thought i would not go around a mountain over a mountain i'll just go through it if he was my leader if he was my peloton i i just felt so motivated and so spirited about that and i and i just sat back and said oh okay well we are actually in an army thank goodness it's a spiritual one yeah because we've got the captain and we've got our so i will still go through a mountain for him and i realized that that um they they had a as a family they had bad sleep and it was you know obviously it was the camp and the and all the organization and and the arrangements and everything yet he was there he was there first up in the morning he was looking after everyone and he just put himself lost and yeah what example i just i want to glorify god that he brought us a leader like this so balanced and so full of love and that just completed the whole the whole weekend for me that everything is for love and and for the love of god and that he loves us as well this is a this is a um testimony i just want to say it because sometimes when you confess it then the lord acts on that and um it's about what i got from the camp um and those of us that have been doing this for a little while you know when you get on a bit you just enjoy serving the brethren and seeing other people get a blessing and that's you know people like brother ben and brother andy and different ones you know that i can guarantee they actually get more of a blessing out of seeing everyone else blessed and about them being blessed themselves because look we've all had our turn we've we've been blessed now we we just enjoy serving and seeing god do things in people's lives and seeing people move on that's what that's what we enjoy and i know that's that's what you're talking about about brother ben you know that's and that's the way that a christian is you know you you get helped along for a while then you then it's your turn you help um but nonetheless every now and then god just does something for those that maybe you know he just that's why he said the i should not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn you know if he's hungry you'll limit her some tea and and um this is this is my little testimony about what the lord gave to me on this camp it's only a small thing but it meant a lot to me and um brother um i had a few comments brother amand said he saw me one night and said oh you couldn't really play the instrument something that happened to you you know and he jokingly said to me oh lord that's what he said that well that's what's happening oh lord let me have what he's having amen well but don't say amen yet because it and and sister already mentioned the same thing and i just want to share with you a little bit about about that and it was special to me um i've been fighting a very hard battle for about eight years and it's it's it is what it is but i've just been battling this thing day after day week after week month after month year after year it's all right but you just gotta keep going just battle battle battle and some of the brothers here have been kind of involved in that too that that that battle it doesn't matter what it is but it's just been a it's been a battle that you can't just sort of walk away from it's just always been there battling away and about a maybe a month ago the lord started giving me scriptures about um david all his life he battled and he was having to fight all the time he was a man of war and then he wanted to do something for the lord he wanted to build a temple for the lord but the lord said to him look you're a man of war you've said too much innocent blood or not innocent blood but you've just shed a lot of blood you're not going to do it but your son is going to build the temple for the lord so david's life was was all battle and war but then there came a time when solomon came on that god gave rest and peace and there was rest in the land and then solomon could go about and just work this work of the lord because he didn't have to go out and spend all his effort fighting enemies and spend all his money building up armies to defend himself he could actually then channel that into the work of the lord that he wanted to do it just the law began to show me these sorts of things because you all know what what we are sort of trying to do for the lord and it feels like for so long it's just been a battle fight fight fight fight fight and as the lord was showing me that i don't know if you remember the sermons brother ben was preaching we're all about rest you know come and i'll give you rest come in all year that labour and heavily and i'll give you rest they were all about that time that they were coming in and and they were channeled another way but i know the lord was speaking that to me that i'm going to give you rest from all these battles and all these wars and it meant a lot and then you know you go through the camp and you just you just help out do what you can and it's you get a blessing but sometimes god just comes down and speaks to you something and and that's what happened as i was playing up there it's like god just sort of opens up a little small window for a minute or two and he just sort of speaks something to you and and he just said i'm going to give you rest in peace from this whole battle you've been fighting for a long long time i'm gonna i'm gonna give you peace with that amen you know when you're playing the music and when you're doing things sometimes you've got to then it's like a little baby you're trying to enjoy something and then it gets upset or whatever you've got to go off what you're thinking and tend to it so it was like that with the music i had to change songs or something so to go back to my mind off that and back to where we were and that sort of thing and then when we got to the next song i thought oh lord you can i'd like to actually hear that again i enjoyed that but he didn't tell me again but i just maybe this was me maybe it was god but he's i just felt him say you know what i'll tell you a game by bringing it to pass so that's just the testimony that i've got that the law is going to give peace but actually his first time came for me in my life but god is so good i meant because i can still create the emboss pier my home and my workplace so many times actually i watch the youtube for something else rather than what you've got but i can see after camp i'm not interesting anymore close the load more and more i can deal with my husband a while whatever situation he pulled to me i'm so happy so glad food in the road and the other thing is my workplace i'm so i kind of task a person so if my stuff has ever done their task i'm so frustrated and i usually tell them directly but i can see i can see i can use you know eic you know system so i can you know i can change it i can see i can change my attitude towards and i can see got those you know great atmospheres i can see them i enjoy putting down the load all the times the cat is so good pretty low hey man so one day i'll share a bigger testimony but i um i just want to i just want to catch on to to what isaac said in regards to to if god sees something that he brings it to pass um it's it's incredible how the song jubilee came to existence and this time i've been fighting a battle for the last six odds seven odd years now it's been pretty pretty big in my life um and god's come and he's he's changed so much in a short time that it's just it's just incredible and the only thing that i want to say is that each one of us have got troubles each one of us have got its own thing each one of us has got your own walk everybody's got the same not the same thing but you've got struggles in your life that only you and god know about and nobody can change that but god the only time that he can change that is if you absolutely lay your life down and go i'm done struggling let god it's like all this the problem is is usually you know god gives us the the the the um the parable of potter and plate um if you can imagine that the spindle is spinning around spinning around with this piece of clay on it the clay can do nothing on its own absolutely nothing it's worthless junk just sitting there doing nothing and um as soon as as soon as god's ready and he's got a vision and he knows right this is the time he starts working on this clay but he doesn't just just work on it softly there's a beating there's a molding there's a twisting there's a kneading and all that so this clay gets formed and kneaded and twisted and chucked this way and chucked this way and just absolutely mashed up before it actually starts getting molded there might be bits flying off here bits flying off there and there's people around you that put the bits back and but everything that happens in your life all stay part of this one piece of clay it never goes away but it stays part of your testimony it stays part of who you are and before god works on the clay he gives you promises like the small window that he opens he gives you i will bring it to creation god only has to say it once but what he says and what he promises he will bring separation it will happen as promises are yesterday man it will always happen and god promised me quite a few years back that when i said lord i now i just i need you i don't care i need you he promised me that he will finish the work that he started and he will give back whatever i lose and that was awesome to hear and then he started kneading and twisting and molding and had hurt it was definitely not what you expect when god starts working your life puts trials and tribulations in your way that you think but why is this happening but in at the end of the day he says he works everything for the good for those who love him and although it might not feel that way and although it might look absolutely dark and desperate that is exactly when you let go and oh god mold the clay not you you don't work in yourself and that's when he does the work and although things seem absolutely useless job felt that way as well right and god came and said well i did this for your good and and you know there's so many there's so many of those things that you see in the bible and it was just before camp that god started working and showing me right this is what the vessel should look like this is what i've planned and so forth long story short god will he will he will deliver on his promises every time amen and hold fast to those promises because that's all you have and just let him do it and walk you all like like karman said as well it doesn't matter what's happening just walk your walk and seek him first seek you first the kingdom of heaven and all these things will be added unto you and that's what i held on to such a long time and my jubilee you know feels like it's it's here and i can be happy and glad and rejoice in it but hold fast for him and what you said was very true is the same thing that i saw is that that usually what a potter makes is a pot of some kind to hold either water or anything or something like that and at the end of the day when god is finished with you then yes you don't get molded anymore it is a time of peace but then he pours his spirit into you to pour out somewhere else amen and to give and to give and to give and whatever he fills you up you then give and that's where the musicians and and and brother ben and andy and everybody comes in where it's like they are they now to serve um and every now and then god will still speak to them if foreign foreign so god bless you guys for what you do and and yeah one day i'll share a bit longer testimony won't take too much time please brothers and sisters um like what just hannah shared before for me i was my first camp and um it was what i took away from it was having to change the atmosphere um and like you see when i got home from camp these things the world i bought sport or a movie at the end of the night and these things i just had to strip out and it was changing my atmosphere um and things were really really hard for my wife at the moment so you know usually when we get home we just fall to bits um but changing the atmosphere before my wife got home and putting what i felt aside giving things to my wife and just yeah changing everything music making sure it was good in the house encouraging her to read a bible with me praying together it's made a huge difference eh so that's yeah well i got a lot more than that from ken there was a lot more but for me it was just saying you know i hannah said the atmosphere is a huge start to getting where you want to be and the thing i hadn't met god was really just trusting the lord but with every single bit and i read this week that uh in a daily devotional that um you need to trust your pastor and i do now a lot more than what i did before then and he hit on the head for me what i wasn't letting go of um and when i let go of that that's when i wanted to focus on the atmosphere and i wanted to focus on my bible and since then yeah i can start to see that love letter that he's put through there and i've started from the beginning and i'm just going to go through to the end and see what happens but that i just wanted to share because if vanessa touched on that and just said i couldn't get by without saying thank you to you all and that i really trust my pastor he's a man of god and uh he wouldn't have done and set up all this without that inspiration from him and you are fantastic brother thank you all right you know what yes you said about the potter when he molds them when a potter molds the pot he never takes his hands off the pot and that's amazing he washes it with water and he always holds on to that pot and it's when those finer details come into play that the pot is nearly done that's wonderful very good that's wonderful let's stand and when we worship this morning you know open your hearts and you know close your eyes and just lose yourself with him and spend time with him and um you know just be quiet if you want to be quiet and you know in his peace and you know or just you know just pour it all onto him do pota's hand beautiful lord a wonderful savior i

praise your great name that you are lord the resurrection and the life how true that is to us lord this morning we thank you father in jesus christ's name we commit the service into your hands amen amen amen thank you musicians thank you for the job amen well camp for me sunday night with you everything to me um the whole camp was phenomenal it was very stressful for me even though i didn't do anything i mean i just like to thank everyone here i mean brother corbin you know omar and the ladies i mean in the mother's room doing the rooms you know everything just everyone just taking their position you all here you know the reason why was camp so good well god was there amen but just because you came with expectations and he came and met us individually amen and you know so camp it was very much a step up from uh from from the first one i think the first time we didn't really know what we were doing or what we were going to expect amen but uh you know thankfully the lord yeah he was very he was gracious to us amen things could have gone pretty pear-shaped there at camp but the lord just in his mercy just navigated us through it you know in the beginning there was a lot of uh i'd say there's a lot of spiritual warfare going on and that's the first few services but then god just took over and he had the glory that's why we're that breakthrough sunday sunday morning brother you know when brother tim invited me about the service he said i felt we had a real breakthrough and then sunday night god just did what he needed to do amen it's the same thing that same battle is an array here but let's press it on amen amen let's go to hebrews chapter 12 and i want to go to genesis chapter 31. i just want to take a thought from the from from the scripture uh especially genesis so let's read genesis 31 first before we go to hebrews um because uh hebrews is a bit of a context so we'll go to genesis 31 and um you know camp was wonderful but let's build on camp amen you know camp you know let's not just rest back and say well he did wonderful things there let's press on and take every promise let's keep pressing the battle until the endless bodies amen amen i pray god just gives us a greater zeal amen i mean to live for him and just love him but everything amen let's just press on amen amen god's given us the country the land is ours every promise is ours amen let's take it so genesis 31 i'm going to read from verse 11. down to verse 13 and then we're going to go to the first and then we're going to read then we're going to drop down to verse 53 so genesis 11 i mean sorry 31 and verses 11 to 13. and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream this is jacob saying jacob and i said here am i and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle ring ring straight and speckled and grizzled for i have seen all the laban death unto thee i am the lord i am the god of bethel thou anoint us the pillar and where thou vows avow unto me now arise get me out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred and then we'll drop down to verse 30 uh sorry 53 of the same chapter and so this is this is now laban is saying his font remember lavon was rachel and uh lee is mum i mean sorry dad parent dad and so now jacob's returning back to his land where you're returning back to the promised land and there's a final separation taking place here between between laban and jacob the god of abraham and the god of of of nahu the god of their father judge uh betwixt us and jacob swear by the fear of his father isaac then jacob offered the sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night on the mount and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned to his place and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him and when jacob saw them he said this is god's host and he called the name of that place mahanayam and let's just go to hebrews chapter 12 as just a bit of context and uh we'll just read from verse 18 down to verse 24. for ye this is where paul is saying this is we have come for ye have not come unto the mount that might be uh that might be touched and that burnt with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i accidentally fear and quake but ye are coming to mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an enumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just being made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speakers better things than that of abel amen may the lord bless his word you may be seated so i want to i want to take that thought really from from there where jacob he you know you know he he comes into a season in his life and he recognizes that this place he's come to as a place and he calls it uh mahanayam and that means that means the place of two camps the place of two hosts and so there's a natural there's a natural host here where there's him in his family but then he recognizes he's more than just him in this place i remember the angels of god have come to visit him in this place and this is very significant because surely after this you know he's gonna go see esau and he's and he's and he gets really distressed because he's he remembers that he had to run for his life you know it was it was quite a few years before this but he had to run for his life because he he took the birthright from us from his brother and his brother wanted to kill him so so he ran for his life and now he had to return home god had said return amen to to the place you once were in and it was shortly it was shortly after this where where he saw the host of the angels there in this place that he would send first he would try to buy his favor of his brother and he and and you know the story he sends his flocks he tries to bribe him and then he sends his family to try and maybe soften his heart while they're my kindred but that didn't change change jacob you know he and then after that he wrestled with god he wrestled with an angel all night and so and then it was only after when he was wrestling you know the sun was coming up and you know and and and the angel said to him let me go he says i won't let you go till you bless me and he touches his thigh and he and it caused him to walk different and he changes his name from from jacob to israel amen from suplanta to prince with god amen and but he recognized that they you know and this is very important because these things happen we find that in the scripture there are great times of you know in great times of distress and jacob was going into a time of distress in times of great distress and when things are coming to a great climax in these times is when there's an opening heaven opens where god causes the believer to know that it's more than just them but the eternal is with them right amen you know don't think of camp is just camp amen but we're we've come into a season and i trust that you you very much recognize it there's a natural camp i mean your natural life however you have it but there's a supernatural camp as well i remember we're living in a place of two camps that's right amen that there's a natural one and there's a supernatural camp and to god god caused jacob to come into this place and this was the same place that david fled to when epsilon took the throne he fled to mahanam amen and and in the bible when people go to a place there's a reason they go to a certain place like ruth came into bethlehem which is the house of god's bread amen you know and and because she was a type of the bride and boaz was the mighty man of wealth who was a big important man in the house of god's bread speaking of christ and they had the uniting there happened in bethlehem and jesus was born in bethlehem because he is the house of god's bread he is the bread i am the bread that came down from heaven amen there's a reason he was born there and so whenever people go to places in the bible the name of the place is very significant that's right i mean that their footsteps have come to these places so david ran from absalom he fled from him and he went to mahoney so he went to a place whenever you know because we are walking our walk and the devil will either raise someone up or he'll just come against you directly to try and push you out of your position amen david was the king he was standing in his position and then the enemy anointed his son epsilon who was never meant to be king and he put in his heart i want to be king and he rose up in pride but notice where did david go to to receive strength and we'll read the scripture maybe maybe we could just read it now actually let's go to um second samuel 17. it's got a second samuel 17. and we'll just read verses 26 to 29. so this is david he's fleeing remember he's fleeing for his life he's fleeing for his life remember there's a council of one councillor there's another councillor and they gave epsilon epsilon was getting counsel from them and epsilon believed the wrong council and the one guy who said you should do this go pursue him go take him when when when he when he heard that epsilon did not take his advice he set his house in order and he and he went and hung himself because he knew there was no way i was going to be successful i mean so so david was fleeing for his life you can go read the story and this is a second samuel 17 verses uh 26-29 season it came to pass when david was come to mahanayam that that show be the son of of nash of rabbath of the children of ammon and and forgive me for these names and uh and mecca the son of of emile of la uh lodiaba and vasri of gilea gillilite and i'll skip the last one brought b beds and basins and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentils and pert and parched pulse and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kind for david and for the people that were with him to eat and they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness so they came to this place and they got refreshed i mean after fleeing and so we you know he went to this place he went to mahanayam because it's a place of two camps amen he went to a place where not just to receive physical strength now this is just me but there's a reason he went to this place why didn't he go to gilgal why didn't he go to some other place he went to mahanaya he went to a place of two camps he went to a place where jacob recognized the host of god is here amen i mean that that the supernatural realm this eternal realm would open up and angels would descend and god would cause jacob to recognize this more than just him in this walk i mean it's more than just more than just him doing his little thing and thinking that he's doing the right thing but god was guiding his steps and it's in times of distress and we've had times of distress you know i've had the post camp blues i had the pre-camp loose amen i just had the blues hallelujah because things would go terribly wrong and you know but you've got to recognize when things are going wrong where do you where do you turn to to receive your strength that's right do you receive it from natural things or do you do you go to a place where you know god is present and then because if you turn to natural things you'll you'll give a natural answer and you'll answer in your flesh and things will blow up and you say why did this happen that's right it's because you're receiving the wrong strength but if you turn to a place where god is hey i mean because god god isn't just a camp god isn't just a church and god is everywhere you go amen amen if you just open your open your understanding or just open your heart and just recognize i'm not alone in this world amen there's angels there's a scripture it says that the angel of the lord encamps about those who fear him and it's not saying angels it says the angel of the lord and that is god and angelic 4. so the very god of heaven and camps around you amen amen hallelujah he's with you every day amen if we could just look beyond these five senses just just one time amen just to see who's with us hey friends we're going to take every promise amen jacob did not settle for being just in a land of a foreign land it's when he was coming back into as an inheritance amen amen he got his family he got his wives and now he's going back amen i mean to the land that was given to abraham he was going to possess that land hallelujah so as when he is going back to his inheritance there's a visitation of angels and i'll jump way ahead of where i'm going but we've had a visitation of angels amen in this hour where where where the prophet stood up and said no i had these you know you know i just had a vision and there was there was you know there's a whole cluster of birds came little birds and then some bigger birds came and then and then suddenly from eternity like a split seven angels appeared with swept back wings hallelujah and he was caught up into the constellation of angels amen and so and this was all taking place and then he said now you know he was he was northeast of tucson on a mountain wherever he was you know the blast came and shook the country this isn't his vision and he thought maybe it's his death and then so after this he prayed and he prayed he said lord if this is the end of my life can you just send your power so i'll know nothing happened but he said lord if this is the purpose of the ministry send your power back now and he said it almost took him from the roof now he was a man who had thousands of thousands of visitations of god and you can see you know you know you hear brother biscuit's testimony when when he's in the car with brother branham and then brother brown's asking him you know do you think this ministry could be that of elijah the prophet and so his ministry said this ministry and then brother eddie said well he felt very insufficient to answer me says i feel i think it just seems that way you know yes and then instantly he said this being just came in he couldn't see it but it was like right here between them and he said and you go watch it he says my fellow my next breath will take me into eternity now we've been in the presence of god i've been the presence of god yes but i've never really felt that my next breath would take me into eternity and then he looked at brother branham in his bed because he'd been hunting for a good week so unshaved his bed was all sticking out and it looked like and he looked like a man who was just about to die and then brother brown looks at me says you know brother eddie ten thousand times ten thousand he's come to me and it's always the same like i could just die because that's why you think sometimes we'll feel the blessings of god but there's a reason why when an angel appeared to someone who says fear not right because it's a real fearful thing yes amen so he was a man who had thousands of visitations but he said this one vision when god sent his power so as an answer of is this a further part of the ministry it almost took him from the room to me that's a significant thing yes and then so he goes you know he goes hunting there a few months later constellation of angels come now remember as i said with jacob those angels appeared to him there because he was going back into his inheritance his inheritance wasn't where his father-in-law was living his inheritance was in the promised land amen amen and so there was a visitation of angels there before he went into his inheritance yes and here we are and we'll go to the scripture mate but i'm just i just want to this is where i'm going the prophet had a visitation of angels here on sunset mountain and then they said go back to jeffersonville for the seven seals are going to be open the inheritance is going to be made known i mean what's in the book is going to be made known you're actually going to know what the mysteries are amen not just not just what the enemy's doing but what god's if you don't know what the will says right you know you can have a very rich i've got a very rich uncle but i'm not holding my breath to get anything from him but it takes a lawyer and probably said this a few times but it takes a lawyer who's qualified to actually open the will and allocate what's in the world not just anyone can do it it's someone who actually has the has the credentials to do it that's right as the same thing with a prophet it it's only a prophet can open the will amen that's right amen because it's the new testament it's the new will it's the will and testament so god has been laying up jesus when he died he paid the price for the will he died because if if if he was alive he could not give the contents of the will he's right but only he will be different when the guy is dead amen so he had to die that we could receive the will amen the inheritance that we have yes amen amen we have an inheritance in heaven yo yo incorruptable yes amen and we have that same we have a part of their inheritance here amen i mean so that's why jesus had to die because there was parts of adam's race that will fall and he said well i don't i want to give them what they lost i mean i want to restore to them what they lost what adam lost i want to give back to them hallelujah amen so now there was a time that was a time in this hour i know brother marcus touched on at the convention but you know this was a season we are living in a season where we had a visitation of angels yes but not just that because remember jacob jacob after he had the visitation of angels then god wrestled with him amen because if you read the scripture he says i've seen god i've wrestled with god and prevailed amen and god changed because remember a name represents a nature or a life you think of jesus you think of the man of galilee raising the dead going to lazarus's grave delivering legion feeding the thousands you're walking on water raising again on the third day packing your sins to calvary you think about all that don't you when you think of jesus so jacob before his name was changed he was a supplanter hey he tricked easter out of his birthright and he did everything he could to to to get all the wealth all you know you know wealth of labar and all these things but then his name was changed his walk was changed amen i mean his his his bone came out of joint or whatever it was and so he walked different and he was called by a new name it's not just a supplanter but a prince with god so there's a visitation of angels and then god himself came and he wrestled with him and it caused jacob to be changed to israel amen and then now you bring it down into us because you say well that's nice that brother brown had a visitation of angels but that's just not it amen because god promised that in revelations 10 that he himself would descend amen jesus himself the covenant angel would come so there'd be a visitation so he had the visitation avengers on sunset mountain and then when he went to jeffersonville he would sit there and he said you know it's unusual and then you go hear it or read it he says that's unusual i'm not sure what simon said in the series but he said normally he always has visitors coming but he's just by himself he had time to study and you know every day he'd go in because he didn't know what the next seal would be and then he said he said he and then he came into the room and showed him what it was in the word so he was now the angel of god had come amen amen the same one that met jacob now came down and opened his word to us hallelujah but not only that now that word comes to you amen and then you begin to wrestle and then you begin to wrestle hallelujah you can't say you know i remember when i first heard this word i was wrestling i was wrestling but i didn't let go until i was changed i mean don't just get partially delivered or partially changed or don't just be affected be changed i mean be permanently changed by him amen hallelujah because of jacob just let go jacob knew he needed a change amen how could he be the head of his people if he was still a supplanter i mean he needed a change and you can know in your own self amen you need to change if you haven't been changed hallelujah he never went back to being a supplanter amen and when god does the work you don't go back to what you used to be the devil may try and send it your way again but there's something in you that says there's nothing in me that wants that amen hallelujah because you have stepped into a supernatural realm and you've been changed amen hallelujah that's right i mean it's a very god himself now he's not just in 1965 i'm sure you know he felt the prince of god there at camp hallelujah what caused the people to you know you know i went back and and i listened to the after song service there sunday night amen i'm so glad we had the crowd mike because we're just praying then the whole place just erupts hallelujah and you can see god's doing and then and then we sing the saints go marching in hallelujah things begin to happen why because he came into the building amen that same god i'm always contending the same god i mean it's present here that is back there and there's no excitement that's not trying to work you up it's a reality oh lou you think heaven's your god isn't just some distant place he said jesus said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world because it's not us that is the christian he has to come in and be the christian in you because when you receive the holy ghost you enter into rest just like god ceased from his own works amen so you cease from your own works and he is the christian in you amen hallelujah what a rest it is yeah i mean even in every storm you just plow through the storm hallelujah amen don't give the devil an inch amen don't retreat don't let him try and steal what he did for you he will try he tried to rob it from me i looked i just said no i refuse hey i mean to look at the negative god did great things hardly he spoke to my heart amen hallelujah don't let him because he will try and rob you he will try and rob you and if you believe his lie you'll be robbed that's right i remember if you remember what god did for you and hold on to it say satan this is mine amen amen this is part of my inheritance hallelujah you have no right to take this from me amen hallelujah you're gideon ahead of time that's right he didn't go to mahoney but he had because remember a place of two camps is when the supernatural comes down and people are like gideon gideon was in a time of harvest a time of harvest is normally a time of joy because all your labors you you know you begin to see the fruit of your labors you know tilling the ground and then and then sowing the seed and then cutting out the weeds and doing whatever you do making sure the vines are growing up on the trellis and you know you just have everything ready and finally the season's right the fruit's on the vine hallelujah but so he was in a time of harvest but then he was threshing weak by the wine press he was trying to do it in secret because he was afraid he was afraid the enemy was coming just like every other harvest every other camp every other special meeting every other time that the word just becomes such a blessing amen and the enemy will just ride in again oh that's mine take it away and he's actually in just about a state as if there never was a heart amen now gideon gideon could not he did not work out or plan how am i going to be delivered of this thing right amen he was stuck in this condition but that condition is no condition for a son or daughter of god amen that was not gideon's portion that's right hallelujah he didn't he didn't say no i'm going to cut down the idol in my father's house now i'm going to blow the trump or whatever we did together israel we're going to fight we're going to plan and get weapons he didn't plan that he was he was he was a fugitive in his own land basically doing things in secret yes amen but then now a supernatural realm opened up to him god he throws an old man with a staff it was the angel of the law they're going to speak to him he says gideon thou mighty man of valor hallelujah amen he began to speak what what what he really was i mean what he really was he wasn't he wasn't meant to be a man trying to just have a harvest quietly that that the enemy wouldn't steal it away but he was a mighty man of valor that's what god saw in him a mighty man of valor and that's what he sees in you highly a mighty man or woman of valor are you are people of faith i amen that can stand up and say i'll not let the devil rob me of my harvest holy i'll not let the devil take what belongs to me because he'll try and steal god's love from you you're trying to steal the peace he'll try and steal the joy you're trying to say it's just a drudgery to be a christian that's right i say if if if he's taken anything from you do not let him hold on to it harlow you have a right remember it's in the will well how do i know i'm part of the will because when the voice of god came your way something in here said that's me that's how you know you're part of the will not because you're born in a certain family or you're good or ugly or whatever you may think you are amen it's because something in here says yes that's how you know you're part of the will amen amen the apostles they were part of the will the woman at the well was part of the will amen legion was part of the world because in part because in the will they said the spirit of lord is upon me to deliver the captives that's right amen and jesus remember in luke 4 he reads the scripture from isaiah he says this day the scripture is fulfilled so this day this part of the will is being enforced amen amen that's right and so all those ones they were part of the wealth because when they heard the testator speaking the one who was going to give the world when they heard him preach they said never a man speak like this man yes there's more than just a man peter said they aren't the christ the son of the living god the scribes and pharisees heard the same preaching and they got angry and wild and they can and they planned how are we going to destroy this one why because they weren't part of the will hallelujah you hear the word amen something in you says i may not be able to put it all together or i may not understand how to but something in me says that's for me amen hallelujah you're part of the will amen amen he died for you not just to forgive your sins but give you a victorious walk hallelujah amen amen where am i now jacob i'll read this this isn't part of a prayer this is an end time evangelism he says i give them to you this morning father as trophies of the grace of jesus christ and of his word which we have preached this morning they are yours keep them safely lord until that day and may they grow as babes may the waters here in the pool find them as they have confessed their sins dying out they're gonna have a baptism services we're talking about being buried in christ to raise again in a new life to walk in a new world walk with new associates walk in a new company walk with angels walk in the presence of the supernatural them things that they can't see around them but they feel and know that they're there and they're lasting things the supernatural is the lasting we give them to you father in jesus name amen hallelujah we friends we walk in a supernatural realm the bride walks in the supernatural realm yeah amen don't ever look to natural things for your answer david fled to a place as i've said david fled to a place a place of two camps and he knew he was king he stood in his position even though he had to run i mean he didn't forfeit the crown he had to run but he went to a place that he received physical strength and also he received spiritual strength as well amen and then after that and then you read the next chapter after they go to mahanayam then they put the people in a ray for battle then they fight epsilon amen and then the victory is one amen god doesn't want us to lean on the arm of flesh god does not want you to lean upon the arm of flesh the scripture speaks against it amen especially your own flesh yes amen god remember we our source of strength is not physically one another our source of strength is spiritually what's in one another and what's in him amen because if god is in you i can contact the god in you amen and so if god is in one another then we can actually receive strength it says you know a word in season how good is it amen yeah no that's not verbatim from the word but it says a word in caesar says how good is it where do you get that word in season sometimes it's from here sometimes it's from the message sometimes it's from your brother and sister amen amen amen amen and so if you look if you look for the supernatural because that is supernatural where someone's just talking away you're talking away then i just say something not even really conscious of it it just anchors in your heart there we go i have my answer and you just walk on that is supernatural hallelujah now he says this this is another you don't mind these this isn't the infallibility of god's spoken word so what we worried about what we're skewing about while we go along great big long face let's look up and grin look up and not only grin but laugh not only laugh but raise up holy hands everywhere giving praise and glory to god for his promises are yea and amen amen not yes and no not yes and no but yes there's no no in it yes our foundation stands for sure our foundation of god god laid in zion the cornerstone there we are can't slip can't slide can't move now remember that cornerstone he laid was christ amen he's talking about he speaks about in romans in zion i learned a cornerstone and he wait let's just read that together come just go to romans all right verse 30. let's keep reading okay so so romans 9 it says what shall we say to the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have obtained to righteousness even the righteous which is of faith but israel which followed after the law of righteousness has not obtained for the lord wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling stone as it is written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him this is the person who shall not be ashamed so that rock is christ that rockets christ whoever believes on him shall not be shall not be ashamed you know faith let's just let's just deal with a few things the thief on the cross and i've said this faith reveals faith is how do you become righteous it's revealed to you christ has revealed to you in the season that he's manifesting himself amen so he's not a god of history to you but it becomes a living reality today that calvary is not just a a historical story i mean it becomes a living reality to you i mean that god when he's declaring his word this hour that's why brother you know your brother tim was saying this message is a love letter to you amen amen amen it's not it's not a bunch of doctrine or a bunch of dudes and dogs it's a love letter to the bride amy and she loves his words so that's why when people say they love the message if it's an intellectual love then they'll just see doctrine but it was the real revealed love of god amen amen thou love him because he is his word and the bride loves the word because the word is jesus christ amen amen now that's not intellectual gymnastics amen amen it's not a historical word a living word amen so revealed faith gives you righteousness amen amen jesus if he himself has revealed himself to you that causes you to believe on him and that makes you righteous hallelujah amen really yeah the thief on the cross remember the story you read you read the two accounts one time they're both rallying on jesus if they'll be the son of god take yourself off and you know but there comes a time where one thief says to the other shut up basically we we we deserve to be here but he doesn't deserve to be here it says remember me lord when you come into your kingdom and then what did what did jesus say he said he didn't say thou filthy sinner you're going to hell he says today you'll be with me in paradise amen amen so he saw one thief it was revealed to him here's the lamb of god dying for him it was revealed to him amen and that being revealed to him and him confessing lord when you come into your kingdom remember me that caused him his final destination to go a total different way amen after that he was pardoned he went into paradise he went to the same place that abraham isaac and jacob and all the heroes of faith he went to the same place he was in the same bracket as moses as daniel is all as joseph joseph was a perfect type of christ but because he was a man he had to fail in one place and he tried to get his dad to like pharaoh when they came into because he said i think it's uh uh don't say to them that you're shepherds because the shepherd is abomination to the egyptians he tried to get him to lie and that was the one against him but this thief this thief that was there by it being revealed to him he made him on path and both of the same category amen hallelujah amen same category as elijah same category as all the heroes of faith and put him into that category amen amen and so if you believe and i just i'm not about make-believe or trying to believe if something's anchored in your soul that this is not a church this is not a denomination this is not some theology this is god revealing himself in his word hallelujah what does that do that's imputed to you for righteousness amen amen that's right remember people aren't just partially righteous you're either you know brother brown makes a story he says he says there's no black white you know like uh you know it's either in or out amen there's not a drunk sober man it's either you're drunk or you're sober and so you're not partially righteous because we're talking about being righteous as in going in a rapture that's what i'm talking i'm not talking about the church going in the tribulation they have some righteousness because they receive eternal life and the white throne judgment but we're not here to go through a tribulation we don't gather to go to the great tribulation or to go to the judgment so when i talk about being righteous i'm talking about going in a rapture and if you go on a rapture there's nothing holding you down i mean there's no change of the enemy there's nothing holding you down amen we're free people amen we're free indeed hallelujah so god you know we just have to recognise if something in you and you sure you may have you fail and whatever more but you must remember those failures are not part of your inheritance you're right it doesn't matter if you're born with them family traits that are not of god must be broken today amen amen in the blood of jesus christ it doesn't matter if you say well my grandfather had this problem now my father had this problem now i've got this problem that may be so but it doesn't mean you have to keep that problem amen amen the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all amen even things that you're inherited because whether we like it or not we inherited good things and bad things from our families and it wasn't their fault they are the best parents that they could be but we inherit bad things as well but god can come and i've seen it yes can break inherited curses amen amen amen he breaks things because he doesn't want you packing things that don't belong to you remember there's a will amen and he wants only for you to enjoy the contents of the will he doesn't want you to take any baggage that you may have brought to him amen as i've said a lamb is not a sheep is not a beast of burden you are not made to pack things that are not of you you say well i've tried to give it to him before that's satan lying to you trying to basically tell you he can't deliver you or he can't set you free that's what he's oh you've you've you you've tried to give it to him why hasn't he taken it from you and satan is basically saying he can't do it the blood is not enough amen friends there comes a time there comes a time everything must die that everything in you that is holding you back and remember you don't actually have to spend your life saying now what happened to me that made me this way because when god comes along you just walk with him walk with him whatever you doesn't matter you may be tearing yourself into on the inside and the devil may be just warring in your mind just walk with god amen walk with god above all and then god in his season remember jacob his whole life he was a supplanter amen and because he was blessed because that was through where christ would come i mean he he was actually blessed by being a supplanter but there came a time where he wrestled with god and he was no longer a supplanter is that you know to be known as a supplanter you don't want that reputation i mean no one would want a reputation you know cheating people out of things and doing shady deals and all these things you know no one would want that reputation but he was born with it but then there came the season remember where a supernatural camp and a natural camp came together amen and then he had a and then he met god face to face and wrestled with him hallelujah that's when god basically said i have to take this out of you jacob and to show i've taken it out of you i'm going to give you a new name hallelujah amen amen now we all know the story of 2nd kings chapter 6. i won't give a quiz what it is i'll just tell you but elisha elisha is there and there's war between israel and syria and the king of syria is sitting there in damascus and he says why is it that israel knows where our armies are going how is this how and then one guy says well there's elisha the prophet and he tells the king of israel even the secrets in your bed chamber so he says okay let's go find him he somehow thinks he can get this guy that's how ridiculous the devil is you know the devil the devil will actually afflict you and all that does is drive you to god that he will be defeated hallelujah if you allow it because some people they just bottle things up and they hold things in amen but there comes remember every son and daughter of god must be free amen and not just be free but walk in that liberty so now everything that the devil does you say the devil's on my back i'm going through this trial you should thank god the scripture says thank god because all it does is drive you closer to the lord himself and so and and i'll get somewhere with this and so elisha so so he sends an army go find go find elisha so they go to a city and they find out that he's in he's in he's in dothan so they go there and then and then his servant i think his servants gerhardia might be wrong he he goes out and he sees that the city is surrounded by the syrian army he begins to shake things are looking bad and then elisha is just sitting there oh i'm just i'm just adding a bit you know you know the prophet he you know he dramatizes stories to make them more real hey man that's why he does it i think so now so so elisha's just there but but he's not worried remember he's the one here's one who's a prophet he has the supernatural in him you know he is the word made flesh in his age so he's not too worried and then so now you know so so as servants all being worried how we're going to get out of this one you know how we're going to survive they're going to take the uh you know take the city and then elisha just prays he says but there's more for us than against us yes amen there's more there's so many more for us and against us and then so he just prays lord open the young man's eyes and then his eyes his spiritual hey his eyes his natural eyes were fine but his spiritual eyes were very much fixed shut so he wanted him to see open you know open his eyes he opened his eyes and all the hills around them were flame chariots of fire there was a supernatural army amen there wasn't that wonderful that same host is in here amen that same member of the battle is of the lord yes that's right i mean to that same host that was with elisha shaw with the bride of christ amen amen because you think you know the bride and of course there's been a bride from from from pentecost all the way down through you know all the believers of every age will come forth in the resurrection as the bride but this is i'll put the this way adam and eve were the pinnacle of god's first creation were they not it wasn't the frogs or the or the sheep or or the whales or the universe it was adam and eve that was the pinnacle of history amen amen and then so now god has been but remember adam and eve they fell so god said i'll but i will rebuild them again and so in the old testament that's why you see in the old testament you see jesus and joseph you see jesus and abraham you see jesus and isaac and moses and nehemiah and ezra and all the prophets you know you see jesus being reflected through these peoples amen but then now when he when when jesus was born everything was in the prophets partially came as the fullness of the godhead bodily was in christ amen amen so he was in moses of parties and jeremiah parties and you know all the prophets apart but now all those ones and that's why when you read i think it's matthew 16 where jesus said to his disciples who do men say that i am they say well you're elias or jeremiah so one of the prophets because they when they when they read what that prophet did they saw it being lived out of jesus that's right in part in the prophet but now it's in the fullness in him and then so the man was rebuilt but that's not the whole story the woman eve has to be because the scripture says he is the second adam well if he's the second adam where's the second knee amen amen amen remember eve was in adam and then eve came in and then that was the whole thing yes right amen i could say what is it the i know there's some joke about the woman no the man is the test run and the woman's the perfection or something because she's the last thing that was made i know there's some jokes so i but you know sisters can say amen that's fine and so but but she was the last thing that was expressed amen adam was expressed male and female shawba was just in one body but then there was a mystery in adam which was eve that was now expressed and she was the last part of the creation that was expressed amen because remember it was all in god's mind and then he just spoke it out and then first you know the universe and everything in the creation and the earth and you know and it unfolded itself and finally there's adam and eve but evil is the last part amen eve was the last part that god was looking for that's right and now here we are because god i'll put you know here we are god rebuilt the man in jesus christ and now he's rebuilding the woman eve not as one but a multi-member body amen i mean through seven church ages but now there comes a time and you know i said this at camp about how god when he restores it's just like a wheat plant you put the wheat seed in the ground but then when when the stalk or the first blades come forth it doesn't look like the weed at all but as the plant begins to grow then finally you have the shook and then the sugar is the wheat and the shook looks like the wheat but it's not the wheat so it goes from a blade that doesn't look like the weed at all so something looks very close to the wheat but then in that shook is the wheat so you start with the lutherans yeah the yeah the reformation that doesn't look like pentecost at all i mean if you just compare the two but god is destroying god is working amen and then the anabaptists and all the different movements that came forth after that then the methodists and so on and then finally it comes down to a time and brother tim touched on it about the bright age now the bride is coming forth amen right he following me i mean so now he's actually saying here is the pinnacle of christianity amen it was shown very quickly in the ephesian age in the book of acts it was shown very quickly there but then it remember it says that you know you know the letter to the ephesian age he says but they'll have left thy first love repent you know and remember from where you fell so they'd already begin to fall so it's shown in maturity and that's why i see the book of acts how they operated and how the spirit led the people and so on that was god showing a mature bride amen amen but they had to go into the ground because god that was just god's program yeah so instead of a harvest there being gathered there it was actually that church was planted in the ground to come forth again amen amen are you following me this is all right so now that was demonstrated but now that had to die but then there had to come another crop at the end time that would be like them but not just looking at a close book because remember paul i think paul was already dead when when john wrote the book of revelation amen john wrote it in 1896 i think paul was already dead by then yeah so paul did not have the revelation that john had on something you see but he was the messengers of the age so that age actually did not and then when they looked at it you know i think even luther he didn't want the book of revelation and in the scripture i might be wrong but it was one of those reformers they didn't want to actually put the book of revelation in because i said it was just all symbolic and they didn't understand what it was i mean but there came a time when the will was open amen and when the will is opened that's why it's so important listen to that message you just don't try and hey sure it's good to try and do study and work it out but just listen just absorb it i mean just listen to the word and as you listen to it you become that word amen amen so just enjoy it and you'll become one with it and then so now it comes a time now where the will's opened and there's a person to receive that will hallelujah and so i'll say remember this is the last we're at the end of the church ages the same gospel is going to the jews so god no he he he built something greater and greater and greater amen you know and then so not to sound proud but we are the pinnacle and this is where i've been trying to get to because you've been following me the bride in this last days is the pinnacle of god's new creation amen amen so don't look at yourself as some struggling downtrodden second-class citizen that may be scraping to heaven that's not how god sees you that's not how god sees you but god has allowed it that you are actually wit and then and then when he saw you born into the earth he says good yeah but then when you're born again he says now it's very good now i can have a relationship with this woman that i've always wanted to love and adore hallelujah hallelujah so now it's very good we are the you know the bride and i'm talking about around the world that is what god is remember the second you know the prophet he makes a statement he says that the that the widow woman that elijah went to you know you know after there was the drought and everything in israel and he went to the book uh brook cherith and then that dried up eventually and says now go to the widow woman he actually says that that widow woman was the same caliber as the prophet amen now here's a gentile widow woman who's about to die because there's a drought in her country and god and his mind is looking at her saying she is the same caliber as elijah and here was elijah who stood against bale and all this false stuff and he you know you know you know he stood there strong flat-footed in the trial hey against all the pressure that jezebel could put you know and then he actually says this woman's the same caliber hallelujah hey all the other you know 7 000 didn't bow to bail but the rest of the nation did that's right amen so he was sent to a woman that would do the same thing he would have done amen and now here you are i'll put it this way you know don't let the devil i'm just saying these things says don't let the devil ever try and think you're just not going to make it you're just not worthy forget what he says i mean you just have to put it at jesus feet and just and just recognize god a few of my i can't make myself worthy you made me worthy you died for me on calvary i mean the sin offering the sin offering of ignorance in the scripture you know when the lamb is taken in the old testament to the priest to be given on the behalf of the worshipper as soon as the lamb comes into view the priest is there and and i heard you know you know cloverdale just had a winter camp so i've been listening to the um sermons it's been phenomenal but but brother kaije was talking about the sin offering he's one preaching and he said now as soon as the lamb so so he comes to worship he's got his lamb and he's maybe pulling it with a uh um you know a collar or whatever as soon as that lamb comes into the view of the priest the priest is not looking at the worshiper he's looking at the lamb because that lamb has to be perfect that's right i mean that lamb has to be without blemish otherwise it's not accepted so so the lamb so so the so the worshipper he actually just goes and the priest's mind he goes totally out of you he's not even in his thoughts anymore i mean he just he just studies the lamb is this lamb perfect and if the lamb is found without blemish i mean then he's offered in the place of the worshipper amen hallelujah and then we've had a perfect lamb amen amen we have a perfect lamb today hallelujah that god doesn't look at you or your situation or what you think you are god just looked at the lamb and he goes to lamb up calvary hallelujah and he went through all of the hall of critics and you know your pilots judgment all these things he says i find no fault in this man amen and he was actually confessing what jesus what god was saying about jesus amen i found no i find no fault in my son he's a perfect one amen hallelujah so don't don't look at you god doesn't look at you he looks at the lamb if you if it's been revealed that the lamb died for you what does that mean god doesn't look at you he looks at the lamb hallelujah amen is that okay he doesn't look at you you know you just think if you're a priest and you're sincere you wouldn't take any animal amen you'd be studying that you would really you know men they just focus on stuff amen you ever been in that situation you just you just focus on and everything just kind of dims out you multiply that by a few million and now be a priest because if he does his job wrong he's going to be held accountable and god remember remember those priests had to live a perfect life otherwise they would have been stoned without mercy amen so he had to make sure that that lamb was examined thoroughly and if you ever examine something thoroughly everything else just fades away hallelujah we have a perfect lamp if it's been revealed to you that he is the lamb of god amen then he he died for you hallelujah now so elisha he caused he prayed that that man young man's eyes would be open and we have to our eyes need to be open sometimes too amen is this okay i'm just i'm just kind of going where we're going and so now god god allows us to be in a trial to go through things because god wants us to know who's with us yes remember it's more than just angels the angel lord and camp's about those who fear him and so you take shadrach meshach and abednego they were going to the fiery furnace no doubt they had pressure before but now really he came to crunch yeah amen when that when that big idol was was raised up there in the plains there in babylon and and here came here came the crutch are they going to bow or are they going to are they going to burn amen so the enemy ratcheted up the pressure remember the pressure and jacob's life was ratcheted up that's right he's about to go see esau that's right amen so now here was he was these three and there's no record of any other hebrew standing up no doubt they would have had church they would have had a prayer meeting before then it would have taken a while for the idol to be built amen they didn't just slap it up overnight it would have been it would have been building and they would have said okay what's this thing while the king's written a law that when that built and everyone blows a trumpet everyone has to battle it okay and now remember the king has supreme power so what is decreed is going to happen and then so they would have had they would have prayer meetings about it and no doubt they would have preached about it amen yes they would have gone to the you know because they had because remember daniel he read the scrolls that jeremiah wrote that's right yeah so they had they had the work and they would have no doubt read deuteronomy or you know your law of moses thou shalt not have other any other gods before me shall not worship any graveyard rumors they would have preached and prayed about these things and said right brothers hey it was just the three of them in daniel in the whole kingdom that was standing on the word amen sometimes we think we're in the minority we know the minority american one with god is the majority amen i mean you may be the only person in your family but if god is anchored in your soul that god he is jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're the majority in their family and you know they would have they would have prayed they would have read the scripture but now came the crunch time now came the time when the idol was there the people were there the musicians were there what were they going to do remember these people those three didn't have the holy ghost they don't have the victory that we have but they stood upon the word amen and then there's the trumpet then everyone probably very piously bow down and they stand there as all people amen and i don't know how it happened but the guards came and grabbed them dragged up before the king he would have been sitting there because remember it was like the it was the dedication day it was the big day so the king would have been sitting up on his throne in a big pavilion all part you know all looking splendor and all the robes and all these things dragged him before the king he said why didn't you bow and they said oh good king live forever but be known unto you we will not about anything you've made amen even if our god doesn't deliver us we're still going into the fire yes now remember trials are for a reason amen amen and so they were bound and so god i mean so the king had that furnace but burning seven times harder than normal and we live in an age that is burning seven times more than normal amen there's pressure in this age that if we went back you know if we got transported a hundred years ago we would just sit there and go oh it's so easy to be christians in this place amen amen all the woman dressed modestly amen there are no billboards of naked men or woman the lust spirit all the all these demons that have been released in the state they weren't back there that's right so we'd go there say this is oh i love them so the furnace has been burning seven times harder that's right amen hallelujah right and then so but they said even if god does not deliver us we will not bow hey amen hey mensa even remember so the devil comes along your way and says look is this and i put this on you and you're fighting this i would say this even if you're never delivered i would not bow to him i would not bow to satan in his devices hallelujah even if you're because he says you're never going to be delivered i'd say well i don't care i'm serving god amen i'm serving the lord for me in my house i'm serving the lord hallelujah remember just walk with him don't get fixated on the problem because if you look at the problem then your focus is on the problem but if your focus is upon the word have your focus is upon the lord amen whose focus is stuck on just say if you broke your arm does your focus stay on the arm once it's been mended oh my arm's broken my arms no you look at the cast don't you you look at the medicine that you've been given amen you don't look at the injury anymore you look at the things that make you better amen amen don't look at the injury it may be a spiritual wound or something you know or whatever it is the devil's trying to derail you in some way some mind battle don't look at the mind battle look at the medicine amen look at him don't look at your problem because if you look at your problem you want it says in the book of jonah they that observe lying vanities what do they do forsake their own mercies that's what jonah said in the belly of a whale he said this is all lying vanities and we would look at it say no you're in a belly of a whale yeah that's pretty real situation you're in things got real jonah you're in the bottom of the ocean yeah but he said no this is lying vanities what what judgment do you put on things right do you say do you say no this is this is the biggest problem i've ever faced well you say that's lying vanities yeah i'm serving god it yeah it's all for my good anyway god is showing me a part of himself in this trial hallelujah so shadrach meshach and abednego they're bound up they're being led into the furnace and they have in their hearts hey if we burn we burn if we don't we don't i've never seen it have you seen anyone else come out of a furnace alive no never seen it happen before yeah that didn't that didn't shake him that's right and then they pushed into the furnace and then the king's looking remember the is seven times hotter yeah amen this is a we're living in a furnace whether you like it or not this is not paradise this is a furnace and then so they're pushed into the furnace and then the king looks into the furnace and says didn't we throw in three men why is there four hallelujah there was a fourth man and then god himself says i see one that looks like the son of god hallelujah and not only was god there in the trial that the fire loosed them of their bands hallelujah amen so just don't forget whatever furnace you may be this world has been made that will loose us of this body only they will go into body change hallelujah because god is present hallelujah to take us to lucius you know jesus said destroy this temple i'll raise it up in three days and that word destroy means loose loose me of this prison hallelujah because i just want to be with you i want to be in you hallelujah loose me of this body hallelujah that's the same thing with us friends that's why we're not happy in this world there's nothing wrong with being unhappy in this world because the reason we're unhappy is because there's another world hallelujah that we've been called to go to i mean israel was stirred up and bonded here in egypt they said god deliver us amen hallelujah they heard of another land and they went to that other land hallelujah man your trials can only you loose you the fire i mean the fiery trial could only loose you of the bands hallelujah amen that are holding you back hallelujah the same fourth man in the fire is present amen i mean to loose you off this body harlow because we all agree i'm sure you all agree even if you're the prime of your fitness and prime of life this thing is a pest house this thing oh yeah this body that we look after so much this is a pest house hallelujah it wars against you your your flesh was against your spirit amen and your flesh remembers things that you used to do and it still wants to do them amen hey amen amen because this flesh your memory brother tim brought it out your your spirit is your mind amen but the soul is the real you so the devil comes into your spirit and he tries to say you think these things fine amen but god but the real you even if you agree with this guy the ruyu actually says that is not me amen amen amen because the son or daughter of god remember we are part we are part of the word amen a son is actually part is an expression of the father yeah so if we're sons or daughters of god we are expression of our father amen amen amen when when his life comes in then we express him amen we don't actually express our individual selves we express our father the same characteristics nature everything we express him amen so now as so so if he is the word remember in the beginning was the word and the word was flesh i mean and the word was with god the word was god then that word became flesh and dwelt among it saint john 1 verse 1 verse 14 amen so if we are part of him then the only thoughts that really belong to us is the will amen and that's why this the word of god can actually reach down to the soul of a son or daughter of god is because there's something in there that says that's me amen that can identify you know before god came your way you tried to do all kinds of things i'll try sport i'll try parties i'll try drinking i'll try a woman i'll try whatever it is amen you know there's our man things but in this inner son or daughter of god there's something in them crying out amen that's not satisfied with whatever i'll try business i'll try money i'll try fame whatever it is but there's something in them that says this is not really what i'm looking for amen yeah but when the word comes their way something in them says this is me amen you're following me so how do you you know you know brother braham's asked a question i think i think brother tim even read it or mentioned it someone asked brother branham how do i know i'm thinking god's thoughts how do i know that you know he says well his thoughts are his word that's how you know you're thinking god's thoughts so if you're thinking thoughts i'm never gonna make it how am i gonna how can i even call myself a christian amen you know i'm just never gonna be free of this thing that's not god's thoughts amen someone say amen is that right if god said whom the son is set free is free indeed my peace that i give you not as the world gives amen amen and then you know but then the devil tries to yeah but then if you agree with those thoughts amen then it can actually take hold of you remember you can't think thoughts you can't stop thoughts coming into your mind but it's what you do with them that's what's right amen it's what do you do you let it build up or do you just kick it out amen because if you let it build up you know why do people become depressed i i suffered depression for about three four years at university i know what it's like and it is a spirit but then how do but if people keep just looking at well i actually feel i feel down and i'm down and things are bad you know if you keep meditating upon those things then you just feed that thing it becomes louder and louder and louder amen but if you if you even if you feel that way because it's a real thing but if you feel that way but you say no my hope is in the lord he is my strength he's my deliverer yes amen i don't know when he may do it but i'm just going to walk with him amen amen that begins to undo all those things amen amen now i just read this a little close now this isn't when their eyes are open now they didn't understand what he was talking about but yet their minds they didn't know what to believe this is the two on the way to emmaus now there's just many people like that today there's many people like that in in in belmont beaumont today they don't know what to believe but do you know what they did they did the wisest thing any man could do they invited him in as it's on the way to mass he was going to go you know on woodsby but but they constrained him no come come stay with us so they invited him in that's it that's it that's then and only then he can reveal himself when he's invited to come in welcome him and say lord jesus i know the scripture says that i might not understand it but come into my heart i want to accept you i want to believe you then manifest yourself to me notice they invited him they invited him in now they couldn't explain it they didn't understand what he was talking about it was all mixed up to them they couldn't understand it but yet they said invite constrained him you must come and he said no i've got to be going on oh but lord you must come and you must come in and constrain him until called upon him until he had to go in that's the way you do and then when he gets inside that's when he can reveal himself he can make himself known when inside amen notice how he did it after his resurrection the true promised word see they did not realize who he was but once inside of them then he opened their eyes that way when he got inside the building with them there he opened their eyes after he got inside he opened their eyes what not just took them by the hand open let your eyes come open their eyes were open anyhow physically he said done i mean i mean dothan rather where where elisha was there in the sirians see his eyes are open but spiritually his eyes were closed see and then not only that but then remember elisha prayed caused the sirians to be blind and then so he steps out who are you looking for elisha the prophet i'll show you where he is and he's talking to them you gotta read the story so physically they could see but spiritually they were blind amen invite him in where listen last year was a hard year amen if satan has his way he will cause us to have another hard year amen if satan has his way but we need to by god's grace press on and don't let the devil rob us of any blessing amen amen amen don't let him rob you because hard times will come trials will come misunderstandings will come but if you look to him amen jacob was facing the greatest trial of his life and he ended up a new man what about you amen we we must take everything that belongs to us amen and if there's anything holding you back you get rid of it amen amen if there's anything in your life and god actually says well you need to you need to give this up you got to be willing to give it up amen amen because god just doesn't take things from you to leave you without it he's not like a mean older sibling that just takes a toy off a younger one he does that because he wants to do more why did why did we start there with that opening scripture about the separation between jacob and his father-in-law because there had to be that separation he had to leave his land where his uh wives were born go back to his inheritance and then there had to be a separation of the families then the angels of god came amen then he wrestled with god himself and he was changed you see i mean we have some musicians to come but we just just press on friends press on whatever comes whatever comes just walk with god remember the trial can only set you free amen hey man i'd like to sing um let's stand together um oh yeah there's also bibles so i should have mentioned the start of the church there's children's bibles and other bibles in the room or on the front table and i'm getting i ordered a whole bunch of other ones and they're going to pitch up too sometimes but they're there to take let's pray song amen let's press on let's not let's not waver god's given us the land he's given us everything amen amen he's given us the will amen that's right amen let's just keep our focus upon him amen
