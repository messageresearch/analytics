========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign thank you [Music] thank you foreign foreign thank you foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign welcome to the house of God this morning [Music] we're good okay there we go it's good to be here it's good to see you all um you feeling good feeling ready to praise the Lord feeling happy for what the Lord's done for you feeling happy that you're a winner when when when we commit our life to the Lord we win everything we win the game of Life we've won there's nothing there's no other prize that we need to win after that we're done we're done so hey it's Mother's Day today happy Mother's Day to all the mothers [Applause] we wouldn't be here without our mothers [Music] if everyone has a mother if you're here you've got a mother and um you know it's the one thing that's under a lot of attack besides anything else that's good but it's such a good thing that it's under so much attack motherhood in this day and age but I thank God that there are still godly woman that decide to be a mother and and and commit their actually give their life over to that cause because it takes a majority of a woman's life you know and they've got the honor in them to give their life over to that cause to raise the Next Generation to be Godly sons and godly daughters and if that if you take that away you'll find the world is going to become a different place because it's been taken away but we thank God that that in amongst all this mess there are still mothers that take on that role seriously and stand up and and do that so we think God for that I'm going to say hi to my bro Joel he's uh not here but he's on the um the streaming today I told him I gave him the login that he whip the YouTube page and he's going to be listening I don't know if you know the testimony he's actually staying at the Factory at the moment he was um I'll just hear this I thought it was quite nice he was he's been in prison for about three months on any we were applying to get electronic monitoring bail for him but it's nice to have your own space so I applied to get him away from the from Hamilton where he isn't and down here and to set up a room at the factory and have him be approved to get his bail at the factory and he has a bracelet on there and um it wasn't looking that hopeful and we had to have the parole officers had to come and check out the premises and um when these guys went there it was nice guys that um they were I think they were Samoan one one old guy one younger guy these are the guys that run the um um probation office which is down the road they came in and um our Factory we're doing a lot of Renovations there and it was a complete and utter mess when these guys came in and they have to approve as Joel can Joel come and stay here and and this our Factory is honestly an utter disaster like it's like a bomb site at the moment it's clean now but and so these guys walked in and they they look around and they say oh so uh where's he gonna live and I couldn't even get to the room to show him where the room was I'd set up a little room there was all the stuff in front of it and plus the room was filled with junk anyway and I can just see these guys talking amongst themselves saying man this we're not going to approve this place man this sort of going um where's the facilities like the toilet net you know I said us it's over the back there and we had to cross climb and stumble over stuff to get to the back and and um I didn't yeah then that was that was a mess because I'd done some work on the on the roof of that the ceiling of that place that I hadn't cleaned underneath it there's all this sawdust and stuff in the toilet area and um I was trying hard to convince them that they should let Joel come and stay here stay there but it wasn't looking good I'm saying no it's going to be good man I'll look after him well we've never done this before [Music] and and um then we walked past Brother Andy because he was there at the time and I had to walk around and show them another spot and I'm I'm trying to sort of make light of the situation so I say oh this is Andy I said something like oh he'll get on with Joel he's a criminal and I realized what I said I'm like oh no they're going to think like we've got criminals here and they're going to be putting Joel into a place where there's criminals and I said I'd say so I'm trying to make a joke and I think man I've got to correct myself I say uh uh X criminal I mean and then Andy says yeah I was until I found until I met Jesus and then these guys say they stop and they say oh do you know Jesus and then he says yeah I know Jesus and so they proceeded to ask us a whole bunch of questions about uh the first they sell are you born again yeah and are you gonna take Joel to church yeah does he want to go to church yep yep he looked at his buddy and he says that's all the questions we need we approve so it it turns out that both these guys were pastors of churches so so they said that's the important questions we've asked you the important questions we have proved that he can live here in this mess so but they are there so we're under government orders to we must take Joel to church though once he applies to get his his he can get leave to come here um so it's government orders that we must bring him to church because they approved it on the basis we're going to take them to church the first time I've heard the government say that praise the Lord so um we'll just stand this morning and just commit the service to the Lord Heavenly Father we're so grateful that we can be here Lord and we can see your Mighty hand working in our midst Lord and changing lives Lord so we just want to um thank you so much for what you're doing Lord we know that when we commit our life over to you Lord that we we win everything Lord because you you are everything Lord

great to have you here amen praise God Hallelujah is this working yes happy Mother's Day God bless all your mothers amen you know brother Bram says how important the prophet held mothers he said to break the backbone of a country or Nation you break motherhood not fatherhood motherhood it means to God bless your Godly mothers and you know we all had we only ever had one mother right so you know and yeah I tell the girls I say you know you got the best mum in all the world you know so I'm telling William that too but they do so you know God bless you all may you have a blessed day amen we're going to go to um I'm going to go to the book of Isaiah this morning I'm going to read a couple of places here I got a few things on slideshow just to um yeah I mean praise the Lord I thought uh Stephanie and Hannah's um uh special is very applicable because I want to talk about when God God loves to see himself in you then he manifests himself so I thought that's real you know Hallelujah I thought that was very uh timely and yes it was a blessing so amen so we're here in Isaiah 55 just bear with me I'm still you know the devil's left you know I'm I'm recovering but you know the devil's lazy he never takes his bags so so a few things that are going away you know but praise a lot um Isaiah 55 and from verse 7 down to verse 11 then we're going to go to Second Kings it says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man has thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and he'll have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my uh your ways my way saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down in the snow from heaven and returneth not hither but watereth the Earth and maketh that bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word that goth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing we're in two I sent it I mean it's whatever God spoke it's going to happen doesn't matter the difficulty while the devil throws in its way it's going to produce exactly what it says it's going to produce I mean take that devil right now amen Hallelujah and then we're going to go to Second Kings bit of a uh yeah a bit of a background here we're gonna go through for a few illustrations but you're just going to read here then Elisha this is when Samaria is shut up by the syrians they're besieged and they're got to such a desperate spot they're basically eating each other's children the bark off the trees all the grass is gone and you know and and then and then and then Elisha said he the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flower be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria then then a lord on Whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God said behold if the Lord would make the windows in heaven might this make Windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shall see it with thine eyes but thou shall not eat thereof so so this guy doubted got killed remember we're going to read that part but if you keep reading down and there were four leprous men at the entering and of the gate and they said one to another why sit we hear until we die if we say We'll enter into the city than the famines in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now um therefore come let us lay and let us fall into the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live but if they kill us well but we shall but die and they rose up in the Twilight and go unto the camp of the syrians and when they had come to the uttermost part of the campus of Syria behold there's no man there for the Lord had made the host of syrians to hear a noise of Chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another Lo the king of Israel hath hired against us the King Kings the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us wherefore they rose up and fled in the Twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen gracious father we're so thankful we could look back at every day and say there you were and we're so thankful Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever Lord as you were back then so you are right now this morning so dear God we want to ask Lord to read your blessed word may you now anoint it to speaker and hear a lord may you touch our hearts and change them like only you can Lord we commit Our Lives into your hands Lord pray you just receive all honor glory and praise Lord from this service Grant it law we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may have your seats this morning amen so I want to talk about the lord loves to see himself in you and then he manifests himself so we read here in the beginning where where the Lord said I will not you know my word will not return unto me void so it's going to accomplish that exactly what she sent it now in the beginning we understand God spoke you know he created everything that we can see the universe and you know even as man has put up the James Wood telescope and seeing further than he's ever seen before and all that all that man can see and the Unseen World God made by his word but the thing is he had to have faith in the thing he spoke you know so so he so he said let there be but then he believed his own word and and that's what it was so when he said let there be sun moon and stars what he thought about in his mind it was a thought that it became a word and it was spoken then it became material because he believed in what he was speaking now God loves to so so so so God had to one speak the word but then believe the word but then what he does is he puts man upon the Earth and he puts that same faith that he had to believe his own word puts it in you and then he speaks his word and that faith in you says I believe that and it comes to pass and Mr God loves to see it when when when there's a faith in a people you know it's amazing what a confession of the word being right can unleash in your life you know as brother Branham was telling the testimony of the squirrels being spoken into existence and sister Hattie Wright was sitting there at her home she had two Wayward boys she you know was living on a farm she was a widow she had trouble your old parents and sister in a wheelchair and brother Brown was testifying of of the squirrels being created and some people were doubting that it had never been done before in the history of man of a man with creative power would Speak Life and then shoot that life then eat that life right because it because you know a vision doesn't bleed but a real squirrel does bleed because they didn't just he didn't just speak the squirrel he shot the squirrel then ate the squirrels right so so now remember a testimony is the word made manifest right so by his stripes we're healed then you someone stand up says well I believe him and he healed me and here I am so what is it it's the word made flesh that's what a testimony is so how do you write begin to believe see it was spoken right God spoke something through the prophet and then there was faith in the inside of that believer and she said there's nothing but the truth brother Burnham and he said that released a super anointing into the room and then God said to the prophet ask her what she wants and she'll have exactly whatever she wants she'll have it so it's so important that we see God loves to God can identify himself with a person that says I believe your word Lord I believe exactly what you've spoken I believe exactly what you meant by it God says I can identify myself with that kind of person Hallelujah so that's what I'm really going to really this morning is God God you know he'll only identify himself with certain people you can be all you can you can live the message through the letter but have a pride stubborn heart God won't anoint that life right but God anoints a hungry sincere surrendered heart I mean that's the kind of person he can identify himself with and I trust that's your heart's desire say Lord I want to see you live I don't want to fill my head with a bunch of quotes and scriptures only I wanted to anchor down into my heart that you can come anoint that word in my life that it's no longer just quotes and an argument and an idea and a lifestyle but it's a living God puts on flesh amen that's what I want in my life I want to see him live more and more I deserve I'm so moved this week say Lord we can come into your presence do you know how a place we are I'm not just talking about for a church coming to church no we can come into His presence every day that he actually desired see he put a faith in your life amen that when he spoke your word something and you said I believe that word hallelujah we're blessed friends we're very blessed people to step into the presence of God Amen and dwell in his presence forever Hallelujah so he put a faith in us amen that we could believe that no see God is not a man God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that should repent me and brother and Paul were talking about this I thought it was so good hath he said and shall he not do it or have he spoken and shall he not make it good amen so there's something in The Believer now it doesn't matter what state we're in because you know we're reading about four lepers there in the Bible they didn't realize they were the answer they were going to be the ones that were going to fulfill or cause the prophecy Elisha just prophesied to come to pass it wasn't the king's offices it wasn't the king himself it wasn't the dignitaries in Samaria it was the lepers on the outside of the gate that didn't even hear the prophecy because they weren't allowed in the gate to begin with they're on the outside but something moved on them when he prophesied something moved up and say hey what's the point in staying here and God and God loves to God can identify our anoint a kind of a faith in a person that says what's the good of staying in this kind of a life there's no point sitting here we're going to die in this condition we may be here by Samaria the king may be there the prophet may be there but we're going to die here so what's the point in staying here and and friends we're not inviting you to go to the enemy's camp this morning but we're inviting you to Father's house this morning amen he's not the enemy he's your friend Hallelujah but they just said what's the point in living here we're going to die so we might as well try something different amen so I think it's such a good idea if life is not going anywhere try something different I'm not saying throw away God but but change your approach to God change your change your walk with God Amen don't do the same old thing because insanity is doing the same old thing expecting a different result I think Einstein said that he's a smart guy he knows what he's talking about all right so you know so so they decided what's the point what's the use in living the same kind of life we're going to die if we go there's famine in the city what's the point we'll die this well the syrians are our enemy but well they might they may if they kill us what we're going to die anyway they may feed us and then they go out there and see they didn't hear the prophecy of Elisha but something moved on them because their thinking had to change because they're thinking was really well where Israelites will stay by the gate maybe the king will give us some food and maybe that's how they were before The Siege started they'd be around the gate the gates would open and you know the the leftover food will be thrown to the poor or whatever more and you know but then something began to change and they're thinking what was that God was moving them you know maybe maybe I trust that maybe you're thinking maybe through the week you begin thinking a bit differently about a few things they're gonna be God trying to move you into a position of a blessing amen so there so there they were they came to this place what's the point which there's no point staying here let's go there so they go there they don't know what's going to happen we die we die you know and that's what happens when you just give up yeah sink or drown I'm going anyway you know though he slay me I'm gonna trust him Hallelujah and then so they go to the Syrian camp they're expecting a century on the outside maybe a maybe if we wanted to be hit by an arrow or so I don't know there's nothing and they go in there they go into a tent there's no one there you're this you know there's food on the boil you know I believe God maybe inspired them you know to cook some food just to flee at the right time aiming for his children to come and say oh boy look at this pointy here and there's this bride going on and you know they go through and they start loading up all this food they get all this treasure and you know they get all these blessings and you know they start to you know same thing with us with the word of God right you begin to get blessed you begin to realize man I'm so glad I'm not living at that gate anymore I mean I'm so glad I've come into this you know into Father's House begin to eat of these good things but then they begin to realize man if we get busted we're in trouble we're in Greater trouble now because we're actually withholding this from the whole of the city because remember they had to fulfill they they didn't have to go and see they had to go and be a witness yes I mean they had to go be a witness that the syrians had gone because the prophecy had to be fulfilled and then so they went there and then they started you know started bearing treasure and doing all kinds of things maybe their belly's right here been gorging themselves and and then their conscious began to get to them yeah you know we've got to go tell so so these lepers now you think about the most unlikely ones to bring a message of Deliverance a bunch of lepers here outcasts they go back and they maybe knock on the gate you know and maybe the little thing slides open what do you want you know because they would know their voices and I say the syrians aren't in the camp maybe he'd lit out a burp and all this food you know how do you know Hallelujah and yes they send out Scouts and everything but you know the rest of the story and then and exactly what Elisha prophesied yeah came into being hallelujah what happened because it was the it was actually the faith of those lepers the faith of those lepers saved the whole city yeah amen they didn't do that out of unbelievables actually Faith moved on their hearts because God had spoken a prophecy and they were the receivers of that prophecy not even knowing it Hallelujah and they caused it to come to pass amen see so they rose up and they went down to that camp and God rewarded their faith I mean is that right they not only saved this uh themselves they saved the whole city of Samaria don't they now they're now we're not uh now you're not invited tonight or this morning to go to the enemies Camp you're invited to Camp invited to come to the father's house where he's waiting for you amen will you believe it amen see you see there's a there's a whole thing through the scripture where God God identifies himself with those who with those who believe his word and love him amen amen I want to be I want to oh God because it's one thing to say I'm a Believer there's nothing for God to say yes they're a Believer right with his presence and that's what we really want in our lives isn't it where God comes down and amends Our Lives amen amen where God actually backs us up and says yes they're my child yes they're covered in my blood yes I dwell in them yes they are walking in my ways yes I love them amen hallelujah that's how we want to be this morning amen amen praise God Amen see just like natural Offspring there's attributes of a believer that that are within us and they're not you know like this this is saying about how you know God would come down and you know you know take his angels they go see it go see Adam and Eva sleep in the other look at them and the angels say you know father they look just like you you know you you do that with your kids you know my mom always used to joke and maybe I'll say it too you know you love your kids the most when they're asleep and you know and okay amen and uh you know but but you can go in and you look at them asleep and you can see their character see their facials and you say you know that looks like you and no honey that looks like you and you know you can see yourself and your children and then you can see their nature is is uh you can see where they got their nature from as well praise God good and bad oh my you can see a Stampy has just been dug duck duck you know you know but but God God does that with his children as well now I'm not talking about natural characteristics now I'm talking about a seed of Faith a seat Gene of God that he places in your soul amen where he looks down he says you know they are just like you the angels will say father they're just like you now if we look at how how God will work with his children down through we can see he does the same thing with you and I am amen where it's not just a you know because this is not something that's passed down by learning right it's not even by being raised in church no it's by when God reveals himself Amen to you and I what's happening of Faith really comes into manifestation and God says I could identify myself with that person I ma'am now every true witness of God will sometimes be put to a showdown amen amen we put to a showdown to prove oh how God loves to do it when he can find a real witness and it proves God like job evolved would he prove that he was genuine amen but God loves too God loves to find a real witness someone where he looks beyond their abilities and their mind and things he looks down to their soul and says they look just like me I mean because if you look at how the Believers acted Through the Bible I mean you can say actually how they acted we can see the same family trait passed down into the church of living God this morning amen how they how they overcame by faith I mean they didn't love their lives to the death they surrendered all amen they're willing to forsake all to follow God Amen that you know you know they turn the other cheek they were quick to forgive they were loving now kind amen all those attributes you can see of the believer you can see actually I can see my family tree Hallelujah maybe in your family maybe there's a temper or a stubbornness or something that's been passed down and you can say well unfortunately that's in my kid because it was in my granddad but you know now that's in the negative but what about now the positive right because God's given us power to overcome family strains right we you know it's amazing you see a little child as soon as they hit kind of teenage years it's like family strangers good it's like a button then everything turns on all those things say man where did that come from what was it within them but you've got to realize children you've got to actually actually over don't be ruled by your feelings right that's a great Victor when you realize you may feel happy oh no you may feel sad you don't have to be sad because you feel sad you don't have to be lonely because you feel lonely you don't have to feel uh misunderstood because you know or be misunderstood because you feel misunderstood don't be led by your feelings your feelings are like you know it's just like the wind or it's like in Auckland you get five seasons in one day I don't know what the fifth is but it's always changing that's how it was at school up there be raining in the morning there's something that's hailing it's doing all this like I thought it was summertime well no and it's well I can't say much for him well it's just windy so anyway at least we're anyway but you know but but don't be led by your feelings see you see because your feelings become alive because you're turning into an adult but you've got to realize my my feelings don't have to rule me amen right praise God Amen so so God loves to find a real Witness amen now I got some photo pictures and things today just because you know we had a awesome day yesterday so those are able by Revelation realized it was it was the lamb I mean it was a blood it was a blood sin in the garden amen so God required blood now I don't know if he knew it or not but before the foundation the world the lamb was slain right so so God put a revelation in in Abel's heart that it was a lamb slaying now it wasn't a natural lamb it was the Lamb of God but because it was revealed to Abel he realized I've got to offer a lamb because a lamb was slammed before the foundation of the world for me and lambskins covered my appearance when they came out of the garden so he offered the lamb and God came down and identified himself in his in his offering saying I can identify myself with that worship so God came down and consumed the sacrifice Cain on the other hand he just bought his fruit and veggies you know his his his his vegan offering and um oh boy and you know he bought his vegan offering if you're that okay I'm sorry for you but anyway you'll be fine but Meats anyway wow let's just leave it here anyway yes good hey God ate God God drank milk and he ate a calf right when he came down and flesh to Abraham there we go anyway but anyway so you see it wasn't it was Kane's self works man I give you it was Kane's ability to make his garden and he bought his works and said basically take it or leave it God and God said I can't identify myself in that worship I can't identify myself and what you think is best so God couldn't anoint that because it was by faith um able to offered that unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain so Cain sacrifice was excellent it was good it wasn't you know haphazard it was like have you ever seen like the Japanese how they do fruit and veggies like they'll do watermelons that are perfectly like a sphere they do it super good I think maybe Kane stuff would have been like that like incredible yeah I wouldn't have been like I just got to the Garden grab the closest thing and Chuck on an altar no it would have been very excellent yeah but Abel's was more excellent than that of Cain amen and he obtained because it was why by Revelation by faith amen so because it was by that way it wasn't by us human Works God could say I can identify myself with that amen now God loves to know so this is shamgar and you know the rest of the story those guys on the right-hand side all end up dead and shamgar still loves praise the Lord but you see now God God knows who he is right he's never unsure am I God am I the creator of heavens and earth am I the Redeemer of the church am I the high priest you know am I am I the advocate am I the counselor am I the Healer am I Jehovah Jireh am I Jehovah my you know am I all these attributes he he is never unsure of who he is he knows exactly who he is so when someone stands in faith and says I am a Son of God God has made me a Son of God or a daughter of God I am washed in his blood I have a covenant with God God can say and it not out of proud but ever out of a revelation God can then say I cannot I can Fellowship I can anoint that kind of a stand because remember shamgar was a was a circumcised son of Abraham he was living in the promised land now for years the Philistines will come in Harvest time after shamgar had harvested all of his uh crops and everything and they'd come and carry off for years the cycle would continue on but there came a season where that cycle came to an end and that all came because because something struck shamgar because he looked at the needs of his of us of his family you know they were all skin and bones they were you know their clothes were rotten away and all these things and yo yo yo he heard The Stomping of 600 Philistines you know it's interesting the devil kind of knows what what we're capable of because here's one farmer who's half starving but yet the Philistines sent 600 men to to to to to deal with them one they just seen one soldier one soldier could have taken this guy out if you think about it no but he's saying 600 because he's like I think I kind of know what this guy's capable of but shamgar had no idea and it's like you you know God I mean I mean the devil kind of thinks what you're capable of he kind of yo he's scared of you if you haven't realized the devil's actually scared of you you're here to torment him yeah not he told me you amen amen it's a sham go one day he saw the state of his family and because you know brother man would say it's like you know you get blessings in church you get a harvest and the devil wants to come and take away those blessings you know and then you just go back to a Monday itis again you go back through a cycle but God doesn't want you to go through a cycle again he doesn't want you to have the Monday blues it should be a Sunday on a Monday and then a two and then a Sunday on a Tuesday and then a Wednesday and a Sunday on a Wednesday and then a Sunday and a Wednesday on a Thursday and then a Wednesday or Sunday on a Friday at Hallelujah and then Saturday praise God and then Sunday's coming again Hallelujah that's how it should be Amen in spite of what's going on in life Hallelujah and then so he's so he heard The Stomping of the Philistines he saw the state of his family and it doesn't say in the Bible that God said to him you're a son of Abraham you can whip all of them he just picked up his Ox goat because he realized that he was a circumcised son of Abraham which means God made a covenant with him and he said that's all he needed that's what made the difference and he took his Ox go jumped out the window and killed 600 men why because God could identify himself with a man who stood on his god-given rights of his birth amen and if we could just stand on our god-given rights of our new birth amen that now we're Sons and Daughters of God not one day now we are amen you know we're built to have dominion over this Earth amen Adam and Eve had dominion over this Earth see everything in this everything in this world Amen we have dominion over every sickness every devil every disease every trouble anxiety depression unbelief whatever it might be we have dominion over why because we're Sons and Daughters of God right now amen so if you stand on your god-given rights because you've got to realize sham Garden earned being a son of Abraham he was born one yeah he did not steal that land that was his land God gave him that land amen God's given us a land God's given us abundant the land flowing with milk and honey flowing with blessings flowing with Revelation faith and overcoming power whether Ralph Lauren with Rapture Resurrection it's all in there amen God's given it to us it's given it to us right now I mean it's not one day no we possess all things right now Hallelujah so God can say so God said I can I can I'm going to join you in the battle shamgar hallelujah hallelujah and that man with an ox go killed all these Soldiers with Spears and armor and all these things down to every one of them Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah somebody just standing out God given rights I'm a subtle daughter of God I'm a child of the most high God not because I've made myself that's no God called me amen before eternity he put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life amen I came into this world my what was it wasn't the first cry singing your praise amen hallelujah I have a reason to worship Hallelujah amen so I think we can Rejoice this morning if you know because this is what God identifies himself with amen amen no sometimes God will give you a God will give and speak an inspiration and then you're actually the one who fulfills that inspiration now I'm not sure exactly when David wrote The Psalm but I believe it would have been before he brought the ark into the city so so you know David will be writing and you know you know playing music God would Inspire him and and you know he began to prophesy things through his songs and one of them here is lift up he lift up your heads over your Gates and be and be lift up you ever laughed lasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle lift up your heads over your Gates even lift them up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory Selah see we know that this you know prophecy has compound meanings and you know we know of course ultimately this is when the you know when the Lord emptied out paradise there on that resurrection that time and you know you know there's the disciples all broken heart and everything but you know the Lord Jesus you know he conquered hell death in the grave and after he took the keys of Hell death the grave of Satan Boot and back down to how he has sent it up high you know you know went into Paradise opened the door and said children you've been waiting for me all these years here I am let's go hallelujah amen and then so they came up to the Glorious City then there was a you know then then all the redeem that were there David was actually part of the strong that cried out Lefty up your heads or your Gates and and B lift up yeah lasting doors the king of glory shall come in there's a question from the battlements who's the king of glory then David would say the Lord strong Mighty the Lord Mighty in battle so you know so that that was a fulfillment right but then it was also upon the earth when David would bring bring the ark into the city now when David first tried to bring the ark into the city it didn't go very well because they put the Ark on a new card and of course you know it began to stumble and then so one good man tried to stop the ark falling off and he was you know died and so on but the thing is that that didn't stop David amen that didn't stop David because he because he'd received this inspiration yeah that that that the that the Lord is going to come into His City Hallelujah and you're the ark you know we know that you know when David was anointed king it said that God was with him from that day forth but we know the ark is where God said that I'll commune with you I mean above The Mercy Seat between the cherubims and so David because he was the kind of a believer that just wanted to be in the prince of God he didn't want the ark to be in Shiloh and silence anymore he didn't want to be out with the Philistines or anywhere but he wanted the ark to be in a city where God could speak to his people where people could could come into the presence of God and receive the inspiration of the word and you know that was David's longing Hallelujah and so so the first time you know the ark um was on the cart and there was a failure but then but then David was determined amen because this is what faith does faith may you know you know there may be obstacles in the way but doesn't mean we quit amen right we don't quit right we persevere amen if there's trouble well we just go through the trouble we ask God how do we get through the trouble I mean we don't just throw up our hands and say well devil I Surrender now I guess you've won no we don't have surrender in our vocabulary it's not in our family line to surrender amen right if you look at our family tree wasn't in David's was it in David's vocabulary to surrender no no was it in shamgars no was it in Moses no Hallelujah none of them it wasn't in them to quit it wasn't in the apostles vocabulary just to throw it you know throw it all in because persecution came their way no and it shouldn't be in our vocabulary either to quit we're gonna push a battle Yeah I mean what was brother Brown told me on the curtain of time keep pressing the battle I mean you got to keep pressing it Forward amen don't just don't just live like the four lepers on the you're outside the Gate of Samaria and say well here we are no we've got to press the battle we're gonna step out into the unknown amen we're gonna we're gonna go beyond our comfort zone and well this is my lifestyle forget the lifestyle walk with God that's what we should be doing amen so David now David was so happy because you see because he said no see see it was the Lord Mighty in battle was coming into the city coming into his City now he began to dance before the ark why because the very God that gave him the lion and gave him the beer and gave him Goliath and gave him all of his victories and kept him from Saul and kept him through all trouble now the very Ark that represented the presence of God himself was coming into a city after many years of fighting and distress and trouble and mountains and valleys and hardship and it say Lord I wet my pillow with my tears and you keep all my tears in a bottle and Lord I'm Forsaken and what's going on Lord my enemies around about me all this trouble but finally God led him through all those things and then he began to dance before the ark and say glory to God I mean it wasn't he didn't care about what people thought of him I mean it was just something from his heart saying Lord I'm so thankful I'm so glad Lord that you would allow me to bring your presence your word your word your presence into my city Hallelujah you may think of a bit emotional but there's something when God when God because God is suffering God God remember this is not democracy with God we say Lord we voted you have to come to church today no or you have to come into my life because like no no he chooses he is Sovereign he says yes I'm going to join them today I'm going to come identify myself with that individual today and it's and nothing can change his mind really it's him it's him that does it he he decides so God God actually allowed David this is David's heart and his longing of his life because he wants to dwell in the prince of God forever and this was this was him upon the Earth saying Lord you've given me that request on this side and he was so thankful that God would allow that and then he began to dance before the Lord and dance around the ark and rejoice and Shout him you know some people didn't didn't enjoy it at all you know he had you know his you know his um Saul's daughter McCall that was married to me I looked out of the palace Windows this is all going on all the commotion and you know she began to despise her husband in her heart saying this is so unseemly for the king of Israel you mean to be dignified and you're the king and have this kind of a Persona and you know Untouchable and you know you know and then and then and then so so David you know you know uh yo yo that night yo she said you know oh how the king of Israel behaved himself dancing half naked before all of Israel and all these things and he just said well if you don't like it today you're not going to like it tomorrow because I'm going to keep dancing before God Amen and God looked down and said that's a man after my own heart amen because remember David wasn't born perfect but he had a longing in his heart Lord I want you I want more of you I need more of you every day Lord that was that was how he was a man after God's Own Heart he had a longing Lord I want to be in your presence I don't just want it to be ceremony and formality and just a well well I can just rest on the testimonies of yesterday Lord I need you today amen and God says I can identify myself with that kind of a heart of a person holy so I trust that you're the same today amen that you've got a longing Lord I need you more today than I did yesterday I need you in my life I need you for my family Lord You're My satisfying Lord I've had a drink from your Everlasting founder but I need you more amen I need more of your word Lord we should never ever just analyze the scripture we should never approach God in an analytical fashion of trying to dissect and all these things no brother am says that's the problem with this lukewarm age people want to cut and and and and you know analyze the word but they're not interested in living it but someone who says Lord I want you to live then God says I can identify myself in that life and manifest themselves amen Hallelujah there are three Hebrew children Glory now to me what actually makes us an incredible story is not actually because the fourth man is but because of their stand see there was a lot of commotion see I can't remember which my children asked where was Daniel doing this whole thing where I said well Daniel um you know actually that image that nebuchadism made was an image of Daniel you know because because Nebuchadnezzar saw God and Daniel so that well he must be a God himself and so that's why Daniel wasn't there right but you see now that those three Hebrew children they knew Daniel was just Daniel they weren't going to worship an image of a religious man and so now but there was a lot of pressure that was going on them you think about the pressure they're invited to that they knew what was going to happen but they went anyway but how when it the music played they knew the inevitable this is going to be the stages of a voice we're going to gather the trumpets are going to blow everyone's going to Bow we're not going to Bow then we're going to be burnt up that's our day that's our schedule that's our schedule but they had made up their mind I'm not trying to be silly but I just want you to think about it but they admire made up their mind we are not going to Bow because this is contrary to what we believe because when we bow we're showing all of our life as giving worship and we will not give worship to this image we worship the true and living God now when you decide to make a stand when you draw a line in the sand and do it early if you start a new job start school whatever you draw a line in the sand I'm a Christian right just say this I'm a Christian you don't need to Ram it down people sorry she said no I'm a Christian right then people will respect you for it but you're drawing a line in the sand like when they went to Babylon they said we're not going to defy ourselves defile ourselves with the king's Meats they started real early and they maintain that stand because just because you draw a line doesn't mean the devil's gonna not gonna try and pull you over that line right but you see they had already made up their minds yes no we're not going to Bow we're just going to burn you know whatever's gonna happen God can deliver us O King they would say to him but yet we're still not going to worship your image now God can identify himself with that kind of a stand when you really mean it in your heart when you really decided I'm following the Lord his word is my standard his word is my everything he's my life he's more important than my next breath to me I'm going to walk with this word no matter what comes opposition trials trouble who cares about it because we're not here to live before people we're here to live before God Amen so now now all that was going on they even dragged them before the king and so that would have been more pressure because they had seen no doubt because the other King's advisors they had seen the Wrath of the king being poured out on other people they knew what he was capable of when he said we're going to throw people in this furnace he they knew he meant it right but they see the when all that was going on brother Adam Silver now now that scene was going on upon the Earth but now let's go up into heaven and God's on his big Majestic throne and then and then Gabriel comes up next to him says master are you not seeing what's going down on there in Babylon and and God would say Gabriel I've been watching all day actually I've been watching them their entire life okay I've seen them well but I think Gabriel said but but Lord don't you see they're gonna throw they're going to throw them into the fire let me go down there he takes out his sword I'll change the whole picture oh yeah I'll level the whole empire and you know God would say to him you know you know Gabriel put your sword away being a faithful Angel he would have done it you're a good Angel your voice stood right by my side through thick and thin but I can't send you so you'd stand there then then wormwood would come wormwood was the one who could float all the um you know bro you know you know bring the floods and then you say master have you not seen what they're going to do to your three your three children there and they're in Babylon and of course God would say yeah I've been watching the whole time you know his eyes on the sparrow no I know he watches me amen are you aware that his eyes upon you I mean not to not to wait see God doesn't watch us just before we're going to trip up and then he's gonna deal a deal with us about it no God's eyes are part of it because he wants to protect us he cares for us he's mindful of us I mean so you know yo wormwood says you know I can drown all of Babylon just like that just let me go do it I'll he says no no I can't let you do it and then so you know you're a good Angel you flooded the world to Noah's day but I can't let you do it right now and they said well what are you going to do Master he says he says they have made a stand for me I'm going to make a stand all right all right Hallelujah hallelujah amen my children has to take us has took a stand so I'm taking a stand too Amen to God what did he do he dropped his Priestly ropes hey man he took a leaf off the tree of life zigzag lightning took it down there into Babylon and as soon as they were just being thrown to the fire how many stepped into the fire amen why because they made a stand God took a stand I mean because God said I can identify myself with them amen I can have Fellowship I can be a witness saying yes their standards my stand amen when God can see himself for you and you and I that's when he says amen hallelujah and that's when he anoints us amen hallelujah my children has took a stand I'm taking a stand too amen if he could come all the way from glory to Babylon for three children how much more will he come to Phoenix I'd say to Wellington this morning for all those who are sitting here bound the arrows come father the hour has come amen if he can go all the way to Babylon for them under the blood of bulls and goats how much more you and I under the blood of Jesus Christ amen we make our stand then he'll stand with us Hallelujah amen praise God you know God will identify himself with people who look for him amen he looks he looks for people over desire amen now dryas dryas was the leader of the synagogue we know that his daughter was getting ill and and and all the doctors in the world couldn't help her but he knew that there was must be a god somewhere you know he knew you know he would teach his great Jehovah God who split the Red Sea and did all incredible things and raised the dead and you know all these things in the past but something in him moved and said he must be alive somewhere today and then he heard of heard of Jesus of Nazareth and what what God was doing through his life and he began to realize actually the god of history is the god of today and brother bran would say in another place that he put on his old preacher's coat and he went off looking for the god of history I mean because something moved in his heart saying he must be alive today and God and and whenever someone really is sincere and they really want to see God alive God says I can identify myself with that kind of a longing amen because because God doesn't put a long in someone's heart just to leave it there God will satisfy every Hungry Heart amen everyone who hungers and thirsts after writes I'll be filled amen so so so he began to realize you know that baby laying there said God cannot die for he is the god for eternity that baby laying on the bed stretched out that little driest knowing that the shooter might got her baby back he said that God of History if he could ever be called into action he's the same God today and searching through he found of some man that claimed to have the power that was Jesus of Nazareth who they all hated but he called him on the scene and he was the closest representative he could find of God at that day a god of the Living God and when he was called on the scene in the historical God was called up he acted the same way he did when he spoke to Elijah on that dead baby amen what his daughter came back to life you know when God gives a promise and the devil tries to steal it away those who stand on that promise and say no the devil cannot take it God identifies himself with that kind of a Faith remember because the shunawat woman was childless until Elisha or Elijah said that she's going to have a baby right but then when the boy got older and then then he went out working in the field with his father and then and then he said ah my head what he got sunstroke then they then they took him back to the shunamite and then eventually sadly he died now then she said you know lay him lay him on the bed and the little room that we made for the prophet and then and then sat on me a mule we're gonna go get the prophet because she realized if God gave me the child amen the devil can't take the child till it's God said so rights of God given you the promises given you the children amen then then God I mean the devil cannot take them amen God must restore them back amen and if you have that determination in your heart this morning what God has given me won't come back to me then God will say I can identify I can anoint that kind of a faith and that faith will go out and get them and bring them home Hallelujah I believe that with all my heart amen of God's given a promise the devil can't take the promise amen just like when ziglag was taken by the Phyllis I mean by the amalekites or whoever it was David's memorandum battle there you know with the Philistines then they came back found all their family or everything taken and I mean God what what what did what did David do he encouraged himself in the Lord I didn't want to do he went to a source of strength and whenever whenever we turn to God God says I can meet that kind of a longing amen I can meet that kind of a need and what did God tell them pursue you'll recover all why because God had given David family he had given his men family and things so the enemy had stolen them what happened God said you can recover all Hallelujah amen do you believe that this morning amen that because why if he gave the promise he will keep the promise amen if we can just stand on his word if God is able to give it amen he's able to keep it Hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'm so thankful for that this morning amen Hallelujah praise the Lord amen this is so that's why we'll just leave it with us I'm gonna I'm just gonna close with us again God rewarded the leper's faith now now what's your faith doing today as God Amen in your life and when he looks down at your life does he see himself on you does he see the same actions the same character amen do you hold grudges or do you do there's nothing in you to hold grudges it's like you got pants or a skirt with no pockets you can't put anything in them so you can't put any you can't put grudges in your life you can't carry on Gossip or unforgiveness or resentment or whatever you can't you can't carry any malice it's just Joy love peace long-suffering gentleness kindness Faith that's just all you're built up in amen amen why because because remember if we're to be like Jesus we should walk like Jesus we should talk like Jesus we should act like Jesus we should forgive like Jesus we should love like Jesus amen we should be a surrendered vessel like Jesus Hallelujah shouldn't that be how we are amen if we are that in our heart God will come down and amen Our Lives because that's what we want isn't it for God to vindicate Our Lives because it's easy to say well God anointed brother Branham but God's to anoint to bride in this last day and we they happen to be part of that bride in this last day so can God come down into your life this morning and say I can identify myself in them see Moses before Moses before um the burning bush he tried to fulfill the word in his own strength God could name in that he killed one Egyptian that was it but when it came to the burning bush he surrendered everything then God used the same man to get two two million people out of a Nation why because God amend his life as he Amen in your life this morning if there's anything in your life that's not that needs to get get out because we can't keep living the same old way we can't just put on suits and ties and come to church and say we believe the message that's not it no it's when God amends the word in your life because what is the message to do make the Bible become flesh Everything Jesus died from Calvary would become flesh and you and I Hallelujah that his life will come unto you and I and live that's why see David wanted God to anoint his life that's what he wanted he wanted God to amen that that his life would be pleasing to God now are our lives pleasing to God this morning I just want to it feels A bit chaotic in here this morning but I just trust you just think about it this morning has got a meaning is there a Sweetness in our hearts is there not a you know if there's a business and a resentment that's that's or doubt that's all satan right but is there a sweetness is it Lord I love you I love everyone I even love my worst enemy life is awesome because you're in my life every day is worth living Lord you've given me purpose Lord I just want to be you know it's like Brother Band would speak about and and I will close with this he speaks about the Lily growing out of the mud up into the sunshine and he says that Lily has got to overcome the shell the mud and the waters in order to open up above the waters amen so the so the lilies first got to overcome the shell itself its own life its own comfort zone its own lifestyle go beyond that then it's got to go through the mud which is sin right grow beyond that then it's got to go through the waters what is that people's opinions whatever one thinks got to grow beyond all that if people don't you know people resent you for shouting amen shut amen anyway amen people resent you for having uncut hair long skirts whatever people give you funny looks just you're not living for to please them we're not here to please one another we're not politicians we're here to please God Hallelujah I mean we say well I don't fit in well I'd rather fit it in heaven Hallelujah where are you going to end and where are you going to spend eternity thankfully not here in this current state so you're going to be willing to overcome the shell yourself the mud of sin and the Waters of people in order to come out on the top and actually actually manifest the life that was within you from the beginning but you've got to be like the four lepers what's the point in staying here we're going to grow amen so God has sent his word and he's put a faith in us to receive that word and then that word manifests but let's have the musicians this morning please but is that Sweetness in your heart amen [Applause] Hallelujah I mean let's stand this morning and then we're just going to pray and then brother Isaac I'll turn the service over to you brothus okay amen but let's just bow heads the sporting so I want to ask you that question again just just while we have while we're in our right mind this is bowel heads spawning there's someone here you say Lord I don't have that sweetness in my life I'm just going through the motion Do You Want To Be Remembered in prayer you know and here I want to be remembering a prayer say Lord I want to I want to have your presence I want you to be able to identify yourself in my life amen amen God bless you all the hands of the razor spawning let's pray gracious father we thank you so much Lord Lord Jesus that's what our house desire is our God that you can look down at our lives and say I want to I want to identify myself for that person I want to live in their lives Lord their actions and everything pleases you granted dear God I pray father would be like David a man after your own Heart Lord may we be men and women boys and girls after your own heart oh God that love you Lord that just want more of you Lord they want to be in your presence o God lord May our hearts be soft Lord Jesus if there's anything in our lives that's stopping you oh God that's a hindrance law that's blocking Lord Jesus take it from us oh God renew a right Spirit within us Lord Jesus father Lord may we be willing to surrender all oh God lord those four lepers Lord they didn't know they are fulfilling prophecy but they they knew they couldn't stay where they were oh God but they had to move Lord Jesus so Lord may we be the same way oh God man we're not staying the same lives do the same old things oh God and get the same old results but Lord Jesus
