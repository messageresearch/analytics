[26:03] hallelujah it's truth amen hallelujah I
[26:08] believe that we might have some
[26:10] testimonies this morning so Lord is
[26:14] before we get everyone to sit down is
[26:15] there a testimony that someone would
[26:16] like to
[26:22] share
[26:25] come have a seat Saints
[26:38] good morning everyone I know I sh this
[26:40] at the Wednesday Bible study but singing
[26:44] The Jubilee song just really brought it
[26:46] back and so just maybe for those that
[26:47] didn't hear it we've gone through a lot
[26:49] of change in our household from our
[26:52] month needing to change jobs and then
[26:53] wanting to sell our house and a lot has
[26:55] changed but the one thing that I just
[26:57] really feel that I need to share is when
[27:00] Arman started his new job a fear started
[27:03] inside me for his health because if he
[27:05] doesn't work we don't get money and so I
[27:07] was constantly fearing like oh must get
[27:09] sick bought vitamins and I'm looking
[27:11] after him and making sure he's warm and
[27:14] you know like really just but it's good
[27:16] though amen spoiling him he feels like a
[27:19] man but um so the day that he had texted
[27:24] me to say he hurt his shoulders and his
[27:26] back I was just a big because of
[27:28] everything that happened that was just
[27:29] too much for me and I couldn't handle it
[27:31] anymore and I was really close to just
[27:33] breaking down and I still said Lord I I
[27:35] can't take anymore you've just pushed me
[27:36] too much this is one too much and when I
[27:39] started praying I realized I was praying
[27:41] every day for his safety and I was
[27:43] praying that he would be okay but I
[27:45] didn't actually trust the Lord with it
[27:47] and so I'd pray be praying but I'd
[27:48] actually be taking it back and worrying
[27:50] about it myself and so when I got that
[27:52] realization that I wasn't trusting the
[27:55] Lord I just left it and I just decided
[27:57] Well Lord you know the needs I need a
[27:59] husband that needs to be able to work
[28:00] that brings money in to provide for the
[28:02] family so I just said I'm not going to
[28:04] worry about it anymore and the Lord has
[28:06] since reveal when he revealed that to me
[28:08] and since I've trusted him I've had such
[28:10] peace like I don't worry about that
[28:12] every day anymore and that's just the of
[28:14] the Lord that God can do and it's
[28:16] nothing that I can do by myself so
[28:18] praise the Lord
[28:40] um oh
[28:42] dear um I don't enjoy public speaking
[28:46] but this isn't for me this is for the
[28:48] Lord because I have never seen a
[28:51] miracle until just a few weeks ago in my
[28:55] life and um and I can't hold it in
[29:00] Hallelujah just forgive me for my
[29:02] speaking but um yeah um yeah I grew up
[29:06] in a Christian home and I've um gave my
[29:08] heart to the Lord when I was seven and
[29:10] I've always had a desire to love the
[29:14] Lord I've always wanted to to be with
[29:16] him and um I was baptized and I went off
[29:20] the rails a bit um quite a bit in my
[29:24] teenagers and I came back for Lord when
[29:26] I was 22
[29:28] 23 um through my husband Maru and um and
[29:33] there was a definitely a turning point
[29:35] in my life and um brother Tony maray who
[29:39] was my pastor and Mar we were in a room
[29:42] together and um and the presence of the
[29:45] Lord really came down so strong and um
[29:48] the air was just it was so thick and
[29:50] heavy it was just real milky and um it
[29:52] was a really special time and um I
[29:55] believed that that was the time that I
[29:56] got the Holy Ghost cuz that's what I was
[29:59] told and I I definitely it was a turning
[30:02] point you know and
[30:04] um yeah and I got married to Mar and
[30:07] things were it was pretty good you know
[30:09] I was I I um I was living a Christian
[30:14] Life and I loved the Lord but I had so
[30:18] many struggles and I had so much doubt
[30:22] and fear right inside you know and I and
[30:25] I just I didn't know if that was
[30:28] just me or I just I I really just didn't
[30:31] know if I was
[30:33] saved you know and um anyway so it was
[30:38] okay you know life was it was a r
[30:40] struggles but it was it was okay and
[30:42] then we started coming to you guys
[30:44] church and
[30:46] um a few months ago and that was the
[30:50] first time that I have seen God and his
[30:54] people you know I like God is a liar and
[30:58] he's in you guys and I it just awakened
[31:02] something in me I really hungered for it
[31:05] so much and I didn't know how to get it
[31:08] you know and I was feeling more and more
[31:11] challenged at home so like would go home
[31:14] and the home life was getting really was
[31:17] getting worse at home you know CU I was
[31:19] just in such a
[31:20] turmoil inside cuz I was really starting
[31:23] to realize that I I didn't have it and
[31:25] it was quite scary after all these years
[31:28] you know it's like what do I do maybe
[31:30] I'm not seed you know and anyway
[31:33] um I had really a bad week I just I
[31:38] couldn't really even function um I was
[31:43] um it was about eight weeks ago and for
[31:45] that whole week I just pretty much
[31:48] stayed in bed with I had Elijah and Noah
[31:52] and Lily were feing for
[31:55] themselves and I didn't tell Mar I
[31:58] didn't tell anyone I just felt like I
[31:59] was going to end up in a crazy home you
[32:01] know it was it was a really a low point
[32:05] and it was the week that brother Ben had
[32:07] said um he feels a real um a real burden
[32:11] for the lost and he wants us to be
[32:14] witnessing and I was like oh no I can't
[32:18] never could I ever do that because I was
[32:21] um I was watching and he put the link
[32:23] for the youth camp meetings where the um
[32:25] brother was saying about the how to
[32:27] witness stuff and I was watched that and
[32:29] I really and I realized FY was I just I
[32:33] knew I didn't have it I couldn't witness
[32:35] to people because I didn't have it
[32:38] myself and um and also through the time
[32:41] that sister Vanessa shared her testimony
[32:44] about um that lady that you that you met
[32:47] and so I was messaging her a bit and
[32:49] saying I really enjoyed your testimony
[32:51] and she was messaging me and it came to
[32:54] the Saturday of that week and Maru and
[32:57] Noah got up Ear and went for a hunt and
[33:02] before they went Marty prayed that um he
[33:06] would just pray he prayed that you would
[33:09] come the Lord would come to me and
[33:11] because he said that naami is crying out
[33:13] for you and I thought that's kind of a
[33:15] strange pre I didn't know that you knew
[33:17] what was going on inside and anyway so
[33:20] they went off and I went back to bed and
[33:22] I was reading sister Vanessa's um
[33:24] messages and I was just so upset you
[33:26] know I just I knew
[33:28] like what do I do you know and um I was
[33:31] crying and then all of a sudden the
[33:34] Lord's presence came down so oh it was
[33:37] just so incredible I was just I just
[33:40] felt like a cup and he was just pouring
[33:43] himself in and I couldn't do anything I
[33:46] could just accept it you know and I just
[33:49] I knew that this is the Holy Spirit and
[33:52] I knew that this is the Lord you know
[33:55] and I I just felt so filled up and I
[33:58] just was lying there and I was just
[34:00] rejoicing and I had to get out of bed I
[34:02] was outside it was frost on the ground I
[34:05] was freezing cold I just didn't care I
[34:07] was just rejoicing I was just I just
[34:10] knew that the Lord had met me for the
[34:13] first time in my whole life he actually
[34:16] had met me finally you know Hallelujah
[34:20] and I phoned Mar and usually he doesn't
[34:21] have reception where he was going
[34:23] hunting but I was just praying I just
[34:25] had to tell him you know and um and was
[34:28] I phoned him and he answered almost
[34:30] straight away and I was crying I said I
[34:33] just got the Holy
[34:34] Ghost like what what's happened what's

[35:28] um yeah just really struggled with um
[35:31] fighting against the desire of the world
[35:34] you know it was like I felt like Lot's
[35:36] wife you know I was like I was on the
[35:38] right ground but I was always looking
[35:40] back I really had it was just the world
[35:42] was so fascinating you know I
[35:44] really yeah I just really enjoyed
[35:46] watching what was happening and you know
[35:48] all this stupid celebrity stuff I was I
[35:51] was always fighting against that you
[35:53] know and and now it's just just I don't
[35:58] care at all you know but um yeah so
[36:01] there was a really awesome four weeks
[36:03] and like I just my attitude was just
[36:05] amazing you know like nothing was
[36:07] sticking doesn't matter what everyone
[36:08] else was doing I was just such a joy you
[36:11] know and um and I thought that was how I
[36:13] was going to always be you know but then
[36:16] um life sort of happened a bit but and I
[36:19] have had some you know bad days but it's
[36:23] so different now it's like I know that

[37:36] amen
[37:38] real
[37:50] Amen
[37:52] brother uh good morning Saints um just
[37:55] wanted to share quickly some of the
[37:56] stuff I've been doing at the Salvation
[37:57] Army um I the Lord put on my heart I to
[38:00] go in there and do some some work in
[38:02] there so I did and I ended up doing some
[38:03] chefing for them um but I got to eat
[38:07] with some of the people who there's a
[38:08] marriage course that we do it for and an
[38:09] alpha course which is an introduction to
[38:10] Jesus and um I took a couple of those um
[38:15] seven Church ages books and bits and
[38:17] pieces home the week after I started
[38:19] working there or the week yeah before I
[38:20] started working there and um some of the
[38:22] CDs of William brenham's life story and
[38:25] I said to um one of the at the table was
[38:28] asking me why I was convicted to come in
[38:30] and work there so I I told her and she
[38:32] was a bit um blown away at the fact that
[38:34] had know Jesus is talking to you and
[38:36] tells you to do these things and I just
[38:38] you know told her what I felt and anyway
[38:40] I said to them around the table before
[38:41] you come back next week you all going to
[38:43] need to ask the Lord a question that you
[38:44] want answered here for yourself and
[38:46] he'll talk to you if you want to know
[38:47] he's real and they all looked at me like
[38:49] I was bizarre but they um so the next
[38:52] week came back and one of the woman came
[38:54] running out of the room she she she met
[38:56] the Holy Ghost that night he came down
[38:58] she asked was she was the only one who
[39:00] asked a question to the Lord and he
[39:02] answered her in two different ways um
[39:04] directly spoke to her and somebody else
[39:06] gave her something else so yeah so that
[39:08] was really cool it was praise the Lord
[39:10] that that happened for it but then it
[39:11] gets bigger the next week somebody else
[39:14] her family extended family all started
[39:16] asking questions and one of them
[39:18] actually prayed for what sort of meal he
[39:19] wanted um and he did he got the meal
[39:22] that he prayed for is what I actually
[39:23] ended up making which was nachos and
[39:25] everyone thought it was really silly but
[39:27] you know he knows how to get your
[39:28] attention like you know if it's
[39:29] insignificant to everyone else it's big
[39:31] to you amen yeah so he got that and also
[39:33] on the first week backtrack when I was
[39:35] working there I was out having a break
[39:36] in the Sun and this this moldy lady she
[39:39] was she was wound up and she was giving
[39:40] this sweet old deer a heck of a time
[39:43] about sorry um a time about she's not
[39:46] impressed with how everyone works at the
[39:47] Salvation Army sorting the clothes out
[39:49] and her standard's much higher and
[39:50] everyone should be better and I felt
[39:52] like I had to interrupt her conversation
[39:55] cuz this poor old 80-year-old woman was
[39:57] getting an air for and she didn't have
[39:58] the answers for her so I said to her
[40:00] look I have an expectation of my work
[40:02] and the food standard is pretty bad and
[40:04] I expect everyone to do what I do and
[40:07] they don't and I've just had to start
[40:08] praying for everyone at my work instead
[40:10] of trying to change my work so maybe you
[40:12] should just start praying and she didn't
[40:13] want to borrow that so I said look I
[40:15] don't know cut a care whatever you're
[40:16] into just give it a whom um and she said
[40:19] no I'm not having to borrow that at all
[40:21] anyway um I was having dinner with uh
[40:24] the rest of the people work with me at
[40:25] the end of the Salvation Army on and
[40:27] having went some dessert and they said
[40:28] oh a new woman came in on Sunday came to
[40:30] church and so I gave her this little
[40:32] Jesus book The Sally's one uh one of the
[40:34] guys said and I said well is that lady
[40:36] like a Mari lady like quite know big
[40:38] tall bigger than me she's like yep um
[40:41] and I said I've actually been thinking
[40:42] about her I had a chat to her and I'm
[40:44] surprised that 3 weeks later she's
[40:45] coming and she came to church by herself
[40:47] and she's asking questions about the
[40:49] Lord so yeah and I um said well I've got
[40:53] a present for her too so I had that
[40:55] William Brandon audio C I thought
[40:56] somebody like that will dig a chilled
[40:58] out story um so I was telling them about
[41:00] it next thing you know all the elders at
[41:02] the Salvation Army around the table and
[41:03] I'm talking to about William brandham
[41:05] and um it was interesting so there was a
[41:09] knock on the door and this woman came
[41:11] through and she wanted to thank the chef
[41:12] for the food and then when she saw that
[41:14] I was the chef she didn't realize why I
[41:16] was there the weeks before she just said
[41:17] thank you so much didn't really go into
[41:19] it much and I said I got a present for
[41:20] you and I gave her an audio CD as well
[41:23] so there's been a few of them given out
[41:24] in that that territory and hopefully
[41:26] things keep happening but it's just
[41:28] simple things e that that that do it and
[41:31] it's encouraging me because I'm standing
[41:34] up for our profit now end time and um
[41:36] you know there's a testimony I heard on
[41:38] his audio CD the other day where a woman
[41:41] had cancer but had came back and
[41:43] she was around all her workmates and
[41:46] they just told her that William bram's
[41:48] nothing you know and he he's false and
[41:50] all this sort of thing and she believed
[41:52] for believed in him and she said if he
[41:53] could just pray for me one more time I
[41:55] reckon it would go and um she stuck up
[41:58] for what she believed in for the Lord
[42:00] and then the Lord I think contact
[42:01] William brand said you got to go pray
[42:03] for her again because I heard her
[42:04] standing up for me in front of people
[42:05] that were doubting um uh so just little
[42:07] things like that enough to boost my
[42:09] faith every day to keep me happy and
[42:11] focused on them I just wanted to share
[42:12] that with you guys cuz yeah we've all
[42:14] been praying recently about how we can
[42:16] approach the world and I think yeah
[42:18] sometimes it's just a couple simple
[42:19] words and Y yeah and people will catch
[42:22] what they what you have so yeah thank
[42:24] you brother amen

[56:17] privilege for me to stand here and uh
[56:22] I'm just uh honored to be asked to to
[56:24] preach to the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[56:26] sitting back there I just thought I know
[56:29] I'm in a message
[56:31] church I know it and uh uh hey you might
[56:35] be seated for a few minutes I just want
[56:36] to go through a few things and thank you
[56:40] music and
[56:43] uh one of the things
[56:46] is where I appreciated the comments that
[56:50] brother Ben made and
[56:52] I it just seems I don't know how long
[56:56] ago but I was sitting in a meeting and
[56:59] brother Ben and Brother Andy was sitting
[57:02] in the
[57:03] meeting and the talk went around and I
[57:05] felt the presence of the Lord come down
[57:07] and I thought something's alive and well
[57:10] in Wellington amen that was before they
[57:13] before this started and and it life
[57:17] brings
[57:18] life and so what I experience seen in
[57:21] those two young men I see it manifesting
[57:24] itself and uh and I I know I was right
[57:27] when I saw life and
[57:30] uh brother Bim reminded me of uh
[57:33] something many years ago I went and
[57:35] preached in a in a place and I'd known
[57:38] the brother for some time before from
[57:41] some time before but through events and
[57:43] that we had gone our separate ways and
[57:47] and then we hooked up again after a
[57:49] number of years and I came down to the
[57:52] uh to preach for him went to preach for
[57:54] him and uh he stood up there and it
[57:56] would have been great to get back
[57:57] together he says Brother Bruce he said
[57:59] and I go way back and many of you people
[58:01] don't know him but we go way back and he
[58:02] says I want to tell you I have complete
[58:05] confidence in Brother Bruce hearing from
[58:07] the Lord and he started and I started to
[58:10] preach and the brother was sitting in
[58:11] the front and I saw him going in a
[58:13] seat going on like this as I'm opening
[58:17] up and so and but then after a little
[58:20] bit he rose up and I said to him uh
[58:22] after I says what was going on he says
[58:25] oh brother when you started and the
[58:27] scripture coming when you were going he
[58:28] said I thought Lord if this isn't of you
[58:30] it's going to be a
[58:33] disaster and I says so where was all the
[58:35] confidence you told the people that you
[58:37] had in me
[58:38] so we're trusted it won't be a disaster
[58:41] this morning I will tell you that I'm
[58:44] usually nervous before I
[58:46] preach but I was I I'm really I was
[58:49] really nervous about today um with what
[58:52] I got to bring and uh then I hear those
[58:54] songs going on and I think well I don't
[58:56] even know why I feel to preach this way
[58:59] but um we trust the Lord amen and uh
[59:03] don't try to Faith cometh by hearing and
[59:05] hearing by the word not of the word by
[59:09] the word and if he comes if you just
[59:11] hear of the word that doesn't bring
[59:12] Faith but when you hear by him then it
[59:16] brings Faith amen and uh I hearing those
[59:19] testimonies I thought they were just
[59:21] wonderful and I I just wanted to I
[59:22] thought I want to share a testimony too
[59:24] if that's right I know I'm cutting into
[59:26] my time you took my time so I'm allowed
[59:29] all that at the end right fine because
[59:33] I'm also nervous that's also got me
[59:35] nervous is that is that I got a a fair
[59:38] amount of hay on the fork and and I'm
[59:40] and I've been scrambling trying to pull
[59:42] stuff out and it's it's really difficult
[59:45] but I wanted to share this because you
[59:47] know the following the Lord is so simple
[59:50] if we allow it to be simple and
[59:53] sometimes we put things in and it's got
[59:54] to happen this way and that way
[59:56] and uh uh around about Christmas time
[1:00:00] before after Christmas I can't remember
[1:00:02] exactly when but I was busy working it
[1:00:06] was about 10:00 in the morning and I was
[1:00:08] busy
[1:00:09] working
[1:00:11] uh busy working at the um on our little
[1:00:14] property we just got a about a three
[1:00:16] acres and I was doing something with a G
[1:00:19] or something I don't know and uh and a
[1:00:23] text came through and it was to say that
[1:00:25] a brother uh elderly
[1:00:28] brother um was in the in the local
[1:00:31] hospital with or pneumonia and some some
[1:00:35] things that Wen good and I and I love
[1:00:37] this brother and and his wife they're
[1:00:39] very simple folk and lovely folk and I
[1:00:42] thought I'm but I can't not go down
[1:00:45] because the hospital's not very far away
[1:00:46] from us it's just a small hospital and
[1:00:49] so I went down I walked in and he was in
[1:00:50] the
[1:00:52] hospital and sometimes people can get
[1:00:55] ideas that they've got to prove their
[1:00:58] faith faith is just
[1:01:00] Faith you know Fai don't don't don't try
[1:01:03] to I don't judge anybody I know what I
[1:01:06] go
[1:01:07] through you know this is sist I go
[1:01:10] through that you know I I I actually
[1:01:13] have a job to stand up in front of
[1:01:14] public and and and all sorts of things
[1:01:18] so I can't judge anybody else I come
[1:01:20] through
[1:01:22] Grace that's all I come through I'm just
[1:01:25] a sinister saved by grace amen and and
[1:01:29] uh and I went in and and the brothers
[1:01:32] there and because of what some people
[1:01:33] say and some nonsense that goes around
[1:01:35] and he said oh and I says Hey brother
[1:01:38] what you doing in here and uh he say Oh
[1:01:41] Brother Bruce he say you know and he and
[1:01:43] he says I'm on oxygen and and I've got
[1:01:46] to take these
[1:01:47] antibiotics you know and he's
[1:01:49] apologizing to me he's taking
[1:01:50] antibiotics and I says yeah and you take
[1:01:52] you take the whole course I says because
[1:01:54] people don't do that and I says you take
[1:01:57] the whole course brother make sure he
[1:01:58] goes yeah I said yeah and his wife there
[1:02:01] and she's just a lovely sister and and I
[1:02:04] said let's just let's just pray first
[1:02:06] before we go any further I put my hand
[1:02:08] on his
[1:02:10] shoulder and I just said a simple prayer
[1:02:12] and I said Lord you just say lay hands
[1:02:15] on the sick they'll recover and I says
[1:02:17] and we take you at your word we believe
[1:02:19] your promise take you at your word and I
[1:02:21] just that was it and I stood back and as
[1:02:23] I stood back I sense something not
[1:02:27] good in the
[1:02:29] atmosphere and I waited and I looked at
[1:02:31] him and I said brother you are
[1:02:33] disappointed in
[1:02:35] me you're disappointed with me and he
[1:02:38] hung his head because I hit the button I
[1:02:40] said you're disappointed because I
[1:02:42] haven't said a shouting prayer and told
[1:02:44] that devil who he is and all that and I
[1:02:46] said brother the devil can shout louder
[1:02:48] than me he can make more noise than me I
[1:02:51] can't frighten
[1:02:53] him I says but we've taking God at his
[1:02:56] word and I said look I'll come back and
[1:02:59] visit you tomorrow and he says I'm going
[1:03:01] to be in here 3 or 4 days and his wife
[1:03:03] was there I went back the next morning
[1:03:05] to see him again he was in his good
[1:03:08] clothes and they were sitting there and
[1:03:09] he was
[1:03:11] smiling and I said uh I says what's up
[1:03:14] here he says and his wife she said
[1:03:17] Brother Bruce from the moment that you
[1:03:19] laid your hand on him yesterday he just
[1:03:22] improved he was off his
[1:03:24] oxygen and they've said he can go home
[1:03:27] you know and yeah I praise the Lord for
[1:03:30] that it's simple you see we don't have
[1:03:31] to manufacture anything but one of the
[1:03:34] things that happened that was really
[1:03:36] good because this brother actually he
[1:03:38] struggles with believing he's got
[1:03:41] faith and so we can always seem to allow
[1:03:45] the devil to make us think negative
[1:03:47] thoughts about
[1:03:48] ourselves amen it's dealt with under the
[1:03:52] blood then let it stay there don't let
[1:03:54] him bring it back up to us just deny him
[1:03:57] that and the day before it's just a
[1:04:00] little hospital and there was he was in
[1:04:03] this bed and there was a h a married CHF
[1:04:06] over in this bed an older married CHF
[1:04:07] over in this bed here that I just knew
[1:04:09] he was there you know I just noticed him
[1:04:11] never talked he never spoke a
[1:04:13] word so we just talked a little bit and
[1:04:16] the nurse come in and
[1:04:18] said uh hey are you guys still here you
[1:04:21] know we're just talking so we got up and
[1:04:24] we start to walk out and for the first
[1:04:26] time this Mar chap over here he just
[1:04:29] said I thought you'd have what's that
[1:04:30] word Cara kakia is that the word he says
[1:04:34] and he just spoke up he says I thought
[1:04:35] you to have a
[1:04:37] kakia and I I I hadn't heard well I
[1:04:40] don't think I'd heard that but I
[1:04:41] realized what he was saying and I said
[1:04:44] oh we didn't want to disturb anything we
[1:04:46] would I was thinking we'd have a prayer
[1:04:48] out in the carard you know know
[1:04:52] whatever but this brother who's got no
[1:04:55] faith and he got got he was using a
[1:04:58] walker and he just turns and starts to
[1:05:00] walk over the brother's got no faith
[1:05:04] starts walking over to this man and I
[1:05:06] looked at the sister and she looked at
[1:05:09] me and I smiled and I thought what's
[1:05:12] going on
[1:05:13] here and no and this man's going he's
[1:05:17] talking to him you know you don't need
[1:05:17] to come over here doesn't even lift his
[1:05:19] head up
[1:05:20] just walks over the bed so I says I
[1:05:25] think we ought have follow him we follow
[1:05:27] him
[1:05:28] over and he goes right up to the bed and
[1:05:30] this this chap in the bed's like he's in
[1:05:33] a bit of a bad way but you know he's
[1:05:35] like you you didn't need to come so we
[1:05:37] walked over there and as I walked
[1:05:40] over as we walked up to the bed I felt
[1:05:43] the presence of
[1:05:45] God and I
[1:05:48] thought what's going on and I thought
[1:05:50] this man in The Bard has got some man of
[1:05:52] some sort you know I thought there's
[1:05:54] something happening here
[1:05:56] and the sister the brother's sister she
[1:05:57] come up and she was beside me here and I
[1:06:00] put my hand on the brother's shoulder
[1:06:03] and I just did what i' done before I
[1:06:05] just said Lord we just take we just
[1:06:07] thank you for your prom for your
[1:06:09] honoring your promise to us and I I
[1:06:11] started to pray the present this
[1:06:14] presence just come down and I heard the
[1:06:17] sister she felt it too and she I heard
[1:06:19] her go like this and I was just praying
[1:06:23] and I stepped back from him and
[1:06:25] something caused me to step forward and
[1:06:27] I put my hand
[1:06:29] out to this man in the
[1:06:33] bed and I said I said would you just put
[1:06:36] your hand in mine and he says you know I
[1:06:40] you don't know I don't want you to pray
[1:06:41] for me uh you know just talking about
[1:06:43] him I said no I I didn't say I was going
[1:06:46] to pray for you I said I just want you
[1:06:47] to put your hand in mine and I'm so
[1:06:51] aware of this presence he put his hand
[1:06:54] in mine
[1:06:56] and something happened to him he said
[1:06:58] I'm
[1:06:59] Healed I'm
[1:07:01] Healed and he was healed praise the Lord
[1:07:05] a man that didn't want prayer a man that
[1:07:07] just thought you know go through the
[1:07:08] ritual and it was a ritual and he said
[1:07:11] something me and he pointed at me and
[1:07:12] anyway and said something and I thought
[1:07:16] that's pretty
[1:07:19] amazing
[1:07:20] and the
[1:07:23] sister said to me she says
[1:07:26] what happened just
[1:07:28] then and I says what was said you I said
[1:07:32] don't keep it to yourself I said it just
[1:07:34] bring confusion to people but I said she
[1:07:37] said why doesn't that happen in
[1:07:39] church amen and I says I can't tell you
[1:07:43] but I was thinking because we get too
[1:07:47] intellectual and I find when God works a
[1:07:49] lot of times it's just with one or two
[1:07:52] okay just Legend don't don't try to
[1:07:56] figure out how God's got to do it he'll
[1:07:58] do it according to his word without you
[1:08:00] even realizing it brother and we walked
[1:08:02] out to the car and this is a thing that
[1:08:04] I I just I just always fight against is
[1:08:08] we shouldn't Elevate man at all amen you
[1:08:13] know and we W and he walked out and and
[1:08:16] the sister's walking behind me and the
[1:08:17] brother goes out to the car and he gets
[1:08:18] in the passenger seat and he's sitting
[1:08:20] in the passage seat as we come up she's
[1:08:22] asking me a few
[1:08:23] questions and he puts his fing up at me
[1:08:26] and he's going to and he starts to say
[1:08:27] something and it's going to elevate me
[1:08:29] and I says hold on before you go any
[1:08:32] further hold on before you go any
[1:08:34] further I says who was it that followed
[1:08:37] the leading of the Lord to walk over to
[1:08:39] the man because it wasn't me amen amen
[1:08:42] that's right I says it was the guy
[1:08:46] without any
[1:08:48] faith he goes what I says when you
[1:08:53] walked over the man you were following
[1:08:55] the the leading of the Lord amen and you
[1:08:58] didn't even know it and I says and when
[1:09:00] the Lord would heal somebody he would
[1:09:01] put Faith outside how come he would take
[1:09:04] a faithless man and put him over against
[1:09:05] a man he's going to heal and the brother
[1:09:08] come alive he come alive he stopped
[1:09:12] putting it on other people and he
[1:09:13] realized that God was using him that God
[1:09:16] used him to get us to that man that that
[1:09:19] man might receive this healing amen amen
[1:09:22] let God work with us in simplicity
[1:09:28] amen talking about going out and and and
[1:09:31] and now this is not my time is
[1:09:34] it I'm not using my time
[1:09:38] anyway you just don't need to to to get
[1:09:43] Welling words of wisdom to tell people
[1:09:45] just go in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:48] he'll work it all out just be open
[1:09:51] vessels amen hallelujah I've got uh uh
[1:09:56] PowerPoint there and this is this is
[1:09:59] shouldn't should still not be my time I
[1:10:01] just want
[1:10:02] to my time starts when I when I open
[1:10:05] with a scripture all right yeah that's
[1:10:11] cool I I'm joking a little bit but I am
[1:10:14] always conscious I I don't like
[1:10:18] long-winded preachers and I don't want
[1:10:19] to ever be a long-winded preacher but
[1:10:22] um I want to go through these things to
[1:10:26] just
[1:10:27] a I want to go through these things okay
[1:10:30] can we have it up brother and and in a
[1:10:33] message
[1:10:36] why he said about 14 years ago this
[1:10:39] woman being around about 48 years old
[1:10:42] came into into the meeting a German
[1:10:44] Canadian she said the Lord told her in
[1:10:46] the prayer line through the sermon that
[1:10:48] she was Barren and the doctors said she
[1:10:50] would never be able to have a child and
[1:10:52] said you're suffering from a dreadful
[1:10:54] disease of tuberculosis so when this
[1:10:57] woman come up this is what the Holy
[1:10:58] Spirit through the prophet told her was
[1:11:00] was her problem and she said that's true
[1:11:02] sir and I said go to your home for
[1:11:05] you're are healed of your tab beat and
[1:11:07] you're going going to embrace a lovely
[1:11:10] little 8 pound boy baby thus saith the
[1:11:14] Lord I'm so thankful folks we got to
[1:11:16] thus sayith the Lord amen
[1:11:20] amen and she went home and was solid and
[1:11:22] well and so her TB she was free of a TV
[1:11:26] she was solid and well all
[1:11:31] right and the doctor said a case was a
[1:11:33] retired I guess we'd call it in
[1:11:34] remission or whatever you like but and
[1:11:37] so and about after about eight years
[1:11:39] passed she said she got into a church
[1:11:41] that told her said sister if it would
[1:11:44] have been of God it would have happened
[1:11:46] and she believed them if the about the
[1:11:49] baby had have been of God it would have
[1:11:53] happened she said healed of a
[1:11:57] TB but the second part hasn't come to P
[1:12:00] to pass and and he says she believed it
[1:12:04] and as soon as she made a stand against
[1:12:05] the prophecy she broke out again with
[1:12:09] the TB because you see the prophecy was
[1:12:12] a two-part thing and to deny one part is
[1:12:15] to lose the
[1:12:21] other Faith doesn't come by
[1:12:23] healing right right amen Faith doesn't
[1:12:28] come by healing oh if I just have an
[1:12:30] experience I've I've heard heard people
[1:12:32] in the times past if I could just hear
[1:12:34] from God and sometimes we do hear a
[1:12:37] little
[1:12:38] voice amen but when the when the
[1:12:41] preachers preaching the word of God you
[1:12:43] are hearing the voice of God when you
[1:12:45] listen to a CD I have heard the voice of
[1:12:47] God I know the first tape I 33 years old
[1:12:51] because there's some faces I've seen
[1:12:52] before and there's some that I haven't
[1:12:54] seen before 33 years
[1:12:57] old Bound in sin when God came to
[1:13:02] me and pretty much straight away I was
[1:13:04] given I was given the CD I've heard
[1:13:07] people say oh you can't give a person
[1:13:09] this CD or this CD be too too heavy and
[1:13:11] all that the voice of God speaks to the
[1:13:14] seed of God inside it don't go working
[1:13:16] it
[1:13:17] out don't go working it out the seed of
[1:13:21] God can take
[1:13:22] anything from the voice of God and and
[1:13:25] and my and M and I we were listening to
[1:13:28] this tape in those days cassette tape
[1:13:32] and we were crying and we didn't
[1:13:34] understand hardly
[1:13:36] anything we just knew we were listening
[1:13:38] to the
[1:13:39] voice of God behind the voice and so you
[1:13:43] know when you s there are songs The
[1:13:45] Jubilee and everything like that I
[1:13:47] thought why am I preaching today why why
[1:13:50] why we just carry on here because that's
[1:13:52] was a preaching going on
[1:13:57] sorry
[1:13:59] uh and she broke out again with TB and
[1:14:02] went and then the preacher not aiming to
[1:14:04] I don't believe he said I was a
[1:14:05] psychiatrist I was a mind reader I was
[1:14:07] just reading what was on her mind and a
[1:14:10] loyal husband stood up and said but he
[1:14:12] told her thus sayith the Lord and the
[1:14:16] preacher laughed at him and his wife
[1:14:19] took to the bed with TB I was up in
[1:14:22] Northern British Columbia on a hunting
[1:14:24] trip coming to down from Inon I stopped
[1:14:26] in about 2 hours and after the service a
[1:14:27] man came up and he said brother brandom
[1:14:29] I'll give you my overcoat and I said
[1:14:31] aren't you brother doble and he said I
[1:14:33] am I says the welfare of the wife this
[1:14:35] is the man you see he says the welfare
[1:14:37] of your wife and he said brother brandom
[1:14:38] told me the story she's real bad with TB
[1:14:41] I said why did she doubt
[1:14:44] it he said well brother brandom it
[1:14:47] lingered so long she begin to doubt she
[1:14:49] doubted about the baby she had a healing
[1:14:52] of the
[1:14:52] TB but she doubted about the
[1:14:57] baby and listen to this see this is this
[1:15:01] is what is our
[1:15:04] promise he said I don't care how much he
[1:15:08] doubts I saw the
[1:15:11] vision Saints you have doubts and and
[1:15:14] different things going on a proper to
[1:15:16] God says I don't care about your doubts
[1:15:20] I saw the vision Amen brother brandham
[1:15:23] had a vision of the Bride
[1:15:26] walking perfectly in
[1:15:28] line any of you ever have
[1:15:32] doubts right oh well then I can't be
[1:15:34] part of it he saw her walking perfectly
[1:15:37] right on Amen but he didn't care about
[1:15:40] our doubts I saw the
[1:15:43] vision
[1:15:45] Hallelujah I saw the
[1:15:49] vision she was holding a big plumpy baby
[1:15:52] boy it shall come to pass regardless of
[1:15:55] what she says or what she thinks because
[1:15:59] God's already said so the a vision
[1:16:02] cannot be
[1:16:04] hinded it can't be hinded by your doubts
[1:16:06] it can't be hinded by the days you
[1:16:09] down because because actually our faith
[1:16:13] isn't in here our faith is in the soul
[1:16:15] realm our faith is locked up it's just
[1:16:17] this battlefield that gives us
[1:16:23] problems about two two two years ago or
[1:16:26] three we was up in Prince Albert saskat
[1:16:29] you and a telegram came in Mrs doel was
[1:16:31] on her Road up there within the space of
[1:16:32] three days of having a baby and they
[1:16:35] brought her in a special car because of
[1:16:36] her at that age they was afraid she
[1:16:38] could not go through it I prayed for her
[1:16:40] and she said one thing brother brandom I
[1:16:41] confess my unbelief but said one thing I
[1:16:44] want to ask you for confirmation you
[1:16:45] said it would be a boy I said it will be
[1:16:48] a
[1:16:49] boy see the prophet had so much
[1:16:52] faith in the vision
[1:16:55] he said it will be a
[1:16:57] boy and it was just after they could
[1:16:59] return home she had an 8 pound baby boy
[1:17:01] that's running around in Canada
[1:17:03] today uh tonight of a mother over 50
[1:17:06] years old because God keeps his word he
[1:17:08] never fails Saints it's not the the
[1:17:10] Rapture is not relying on
[1:17:12] us we see ourselves in in that
[1:17:17] promise and then Satan's going to thresh
[1:17:19] you whatever he can to try to but it the
[1:17:23] the vision cannot fail amen praise God
[1:17:26] for that amen healing doesn't come by
[1:17:29] faith if I could just have a have a
[1:17:32] healing in my life if I if if this
[1:17:34] happened to me I'd believe God no we
[1:17:37] believe God by the hearing by the
[1:17:40] word
[1:17:44] amen now another thing I want to bring
[1:17:46] and and uh it's on my heart it was on my
[1:17:49] heart to bring it after hearing the
[1:17:51] songs I thought why am I
[1:17:53] but we'll we'll get a attack and people
[1:17:55] say things about this message and Satan
[1:17:57] causes people to say things even within
[1:18:00] it and many say we' gone on from the
[1:18:04] prophet and either blatantly or subtly
[1:18:07] they'll they'll infer things and one of
[1:18:09] one of the things that the usually the
[1:18:11] reason one way or another they bring it
[1:18:13] is that the prophet represented the
[1:18:16] law and we're now following the ministry
[1:18:19] of
[1:18:20] Joshua and you'll get many many
[1:18:22] preachers even around a message that was
[1:18:25] saying you know I'm the josa ministry
[1:18:28] brother Brandon was Moses and we gone on
[1:18:29] from
[1:18:30] that and it's said it's Joshua and
[1:18:33] they'll take parts of quotes and take
[1:18:35] them out of context and say you know um
[1:18:38] I'm here for the perfecting of the bride
[1:18:40] and so forth we are under Joshua but I
[1:18:43] want us to have a look what these people
[1:18:44] are saying because it's not
[1:18:46] right and in the message Paradox he says
[1:18:50] about two few years ago he said I would
[1:18:54] take a Bible
[1:18:55] and hey folks if I say something I'm
[1:18:58] just an old man I notice there everybody
[1:19:00] around here is Young you know I don't
[1:19:01] know why you let me in um this is a
[1:19:03] youth
[1:19:05] group and I see these Dynamic young
[1:19:07] preachers and brothers and new Dynamic
[1:19:09] people and the sing Dynamic and I think
[1:19:11] why you want an old guy like me in here
[1:19:13] that's one you let me in I must have got
[1:19:15] special dispensation or something all
[1:19:17] right but if I say something you know
[1:19:20] and you have a query on it or you don't
[1:19:22] hey we're brothers and sisters just
[1:19:24] allow me just just allow me something
[1:19:25] you know just say poor old guy's in his
[1:19:27] dotage and you know but we'll find a bed
[1:19:30] for him afterwards or something like
[1:19:32] that you know he's out of his mind but
[1:19:34] the these things are so real and true to
[1:19:36] me you know and and I know I know the
[1:19:39] heart of brother Ben so if I say
[1:19:40] something wrong please just forgive me
[1:19:41] and you know you you get brother Ben
[1:19:43] will put it right he'll doctor
[1:19:50] you I would take a bible let you hand me
[1:19:52] the the Bible when I first started my
[1:19:54] Ministry and would just take your Bible
[1:19:56] just hold it open like that and say Lord
[1:19:58] where is this message to me and I if I
[1:20:00] can put it in my words where am I in
[1:20:02] this message where can I find me in this
[1:20:07] message it opened to Joshua the first
[1:20:10] chapter any Bible you'd hand me he said
[1:20:12] it will open to Joshua first chapter for
[1:20:16] him until one night a vision came and I
[1:20:18] seen that Bible that Bible come down
[1:20:21] from heaven and a hand with a collar on
[1:20:22] cuff on a cuff uh like this went went
[1:20:25] down the first nine verses of Joshua
[1:20:28] just skipping down now we find Joshua
[1:20:30] representing Grace or some propitiation
[1:20:32] that it could not exist in the same time
[1:20:34] that law was in existence neither does
[1:20:36] any message that forwards people on ever
[1:20:38] coincide with a past message it will not
[1:20:41] do it that's where you have the trouble
[1:20:43] today and Joshua could not at all come
[1:20:46] into his ministry until after Moses is
[1:20:48] gone and this is what people have has
[1:20:50] told me I was getting this in 83 1983
[1:20:54] from the time I come to this message
[1:20:55] from the time I come to the Lord I was
[1:20:58] seeing that God in my heart was putting
[1:21:00] emphasis and the and the the prophet of
[1:21:02] God became my
[1:21:04] anchor and people would say things like
[1:21:08] Oh Brother Bru you got to keep your
[1:21:09] balance and every time they go like this
[1:21:11] you got to keep your balance I go yeah
[1:21:14] you're balance because everybody has an
[1:21:17] agenda it
[1:21:18] seems okay and and and I just say this
[1:21:22] to Mar the other day I says you know the
[1:21:23] balance
[1:21:25] because I would never tell you you need
[1:21:26] my
[1:21:27] balance I just trust into God that his
[1:21:30] grace will keep me in it
[1:21:33] amen because because some would have me
[1:21:37] not go as far as I've gone to keep the
[1:21:39] balance others would have me go further
[1:21:42] than what I've gone to keep the balance
[1:21:44] and they're out of
[1:21:45] balance and I said to my I says you know
[1:21:47] the balance this is just the other day I
[1:21:49] says the Holy Ghost is a balance amen
[1:21:53] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the one
[1:21:56] that gives us a witness inside it's not
[1:21:58] been able to explain my balance but the
[1:22:00] Holy Ghost and it just keep your
[1:22:03] balance if I say something wrong just
[1:22:05] keep the
[1:22:07] balance I trust I
[1:22:10] won't this's another problem I have is
[1:22:12] memory I don't know where I was
[1:22:18] at oh yeah come into his ministry until
[1:22:21] Moses is gone so you see the very first
[1:22:23] verse here Moses my servant is dead now
[1:22:26] arise and take this people to the
[1:22:27] promised land Moses representing the law
[1:22:30] had served its time they started out and
[1:22:32] this is wonderful thing they started out
[1:22:34] really with grace to begin
[1:22:37] with before they had law they had
[1:22:40] Grace that atonement had been provided
[1:22:44] before there was any
[1:22:46] law what do we say by the law by Grace
[1:22:48] was said by Grace the atonement was made
[1:22:51] before any law amen
[1:22:54] Grace was be was before law during law
[1:22:58] and after
[1:22:59] law so there was Mo there was Joshua
[1:23:02] representing Grace was right along with
[1:23:04] law but could not be enforced as long as
[1:23:06] law was in its proper place Joshua here
[1:23:10] today is a type of the last day Ministry
[1:23:14] and this is what people use but but
[1:23:17] let's keep the
[1:23:18] balance now remember those three stages
[1:23:21] of the journey all of it ceased first
[1:23:22] the law and everything had to ceased so
[1:23:24] that Joshua and Joshua is the same word
[1:23:27] as Jesus Jehovah savior that took them
[1:23:29] from their Wilderness into the promised
[1:23:33] land and to encapsulate this I'm going
[1:23:36] to take a quote out of the out of the
[1:23:38] supernatural book six bring it all
[1:23:41] together and it said ever since that day
[1:23:44] in
[1:23:45] 1952 The Prophet had known he had known
[1:23:48] that his ministry would somehow parallel
[1:23:51] the ministry of Joshua amen that's
[1:23:56] right when I come to this come to the
[1:23:59] Lord and he brought me into this message
[1:24:01] and we were singing these songs that
[1:24:04] Jubilee and I and and I haven't heard
[1:24:06] that song before but I just loved it and
[1:24:08] I love the songs you're singing okay but
[1:24:10] people sing these songs about how we're
[1:24:12] brought out of that and they and they
[1:24:14] apply that to the prophet but they say
[1:24:15] it was law I never saw the prophet as
[1:24:18] law I never saw the prophet as law I
[1:24:21] could not I could not I had no witness
[1:24:23] of their bound the ones that would say
[1:24:25] oh he's this he's that we've gone on and
[1:24:27] so forth sure the bride's Moving on but
[1:24:30] I tell you what it's his message it's
[1:24:32] his Storehouse that keeps opening up and
[1:24:35] opening up and opening up and feeding my
[1:24:37] soul right and I I tell you what oh used
[1:24:42] my
[1:24:44] T this is such a glorious message it's
[1:24:48] all locked in it and God is opening it
[1:24:52] up and people are going past that where
[1:24:55] they can't get anything opening up more
[1:24:57] so what do they do they open something
[1:24:59] else up that's not the word of God and
[1:25:01] suddenly the man becomes
[1:25:07] something hallelujah hallelujah I
[1:25:10] haven't been run off
[1:25:11] yet and a
[1:25:13] message uh no
[1:25:16] for no no go just just go back one
[1:25:19] brother I'll I'll just read this out no
[1:25:21] get oh yeah that's it fine just hold it
[1:25:24] there I haven't got this honor just it
[1:25:26] was just come to me when I was sitting
[1:25:27] in the car some I preached the other day
[1:25:30] in a message be not afraid of it as I
[1:25:32] brother brah said God so loved you when
[1:25:34] you was a sinner an alien away from God
[1:25:38] an enemy of the Commonwealth of God he
[1:25:40] so loved you that he gave his life for
[1:25:43] you
[1:25:44] sure if you get a spirit in
[1:25:47] you if you get a spirit in you that
[1:25:50] you're better than someone else then
[1:25:53] you're worse than anybody else I know
[1:25:58] of am I've seen churches that think
[1:26:01] they're the better one of they're the
[1:26:03] best Church in the country I've seen
[1:26:06] people I've seen ministers that think
[1:26:08] they're the best Minister I've heard
[1:26:09] them say it over pulpits to the folks
[1:26:11] you know well who would be the best
[1:26:13] Minister and I'm going what am I hearing
[1:26:16] here where do we come from with this
[1:26:29] I I just want to let the Lord check me I
[1:26:31] don't want
[1:26:33] to but I I I feel as I was sitting in
[1:26:36] amongst a bunch of ministers about 80
[1:26:39] months
[1:26:41] ago and one of the it was it wasn't a
[1:26:43] New Zealand Pastor don't go thinking who
[1:26:44] it was it wasn't a pastor from New
[1:26:46] Zealand but I heard this this Minister
[1:26:50] say because you know that the pastors of
[1:26:52] the Tree of Life
[1:26:55] and the and the
[1:26:57] deacons and the deacons are the cherubin
[1:27:00] they guide the people to the Tree of
[1:27:02] Life they took it away from the prophet
[1:27:06] they took it away from Jesus Christ and
[1:27:09] and now and now I've heard and I tell
[1:27:11] you what I got up I walked away I looked
[1:27:14] around I thought I see
[1:27:16] everybody and I got up and walked away
[1:27:18] because I thought I'm going to say
[1:27:20] something here because this is so so
[1:27:24] wrong the spirit was wrong and I walked
[1:27:27] away I never went back they had a series
[1:27:28] of meetings and I never went back to
[1:27:30] another one I heard that that one that
[1:27:32] said it now has been saying things where
[1:27:35] back home that people are ringing up
[1:27:37] even brother Vin do you go along with
[1:27:39] what this man's saying you see once you
[1:27:40] start away from a balance once you start
[1:27:43] elevating especially of it's yourself
[1:27:46] you're just going to go further and
[1:27:47] further off the taret Saints just stay
[1:27:50] with a simple gospel amen I told you I'd
[1:27:54] come feeling nervous but when I sitting
[1:27:56] at the back even before the song service
[1:27:59] I just started feeling really nice
[1:28:01] because there was an atmosphere coming
[1:28:03] in with the folks he sister I I agree
[1:28:06] when you were saying that and i' I've
[1:28:08] been here before I don't get invited
[1:28:10] very often but I
[1:28:13] I
[1:28:15] but I don't know

[1:30:14] we haven't read the
[1:30:17] scripture I'm getting too
[1:30:19] excited and I turned to see the voice
[1:30:23] that spake with me in because we know
[1:30:24] this is John speaking and John is the
[1:30:26] type of the Bride
[1:30:28] amen and I turned to see the voice that
[1:30:30] spake with me and being turned I saw
[1:30:32] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[1:30:34] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[1:30:36] under the son of man clothed with a
[1:30:38] garment down to the foot and G about the
[1:30:40] pets with a golden GLE his head and his
[1:30:41] hairs were white like wool as white as
[1:30:44] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[1:30:46] fire and his feet like under fine brass
[1:30:49] and they burned as if they burned in a
[1:30:52] furnace and his voice is a sound of many
[1:30:54] Waters and he had in his right hand
[1:30:55] Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a
[1:30:58] sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:30:59] countenance was as a sun shineth in his
[1:31:01] strength and when I saw him I fell at
[1:31:04] his feet as dead he laid his right hand
[1:31:07] upon me saying unto me fear not I'm the
[1:31:09] first and the last I am he that liveth
[1:31:11] and was dead and behold I'm alive
[1:31:13] forever more amen and have the keys of
[1:31:15] hell and
[1:31:16] death write the
[1:31:19] things which
[1:31:21] thou which thou has seen and the the
[1:31:24] things which are and the things which
[1:31:25] shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the
[1:31:28] Seven Stars which thou sest in my right
[1:31:30] hand and the Seven golden candlesticks
[1:31:31] the Seven Stars are the Angels of the
[1:31:33] seven churches and the Seven
[1:31:35] candlesticks which thou sest are the
[1:31:38] seven
[1:31:43] churches amen may the Lord had his bless
[1:31:46] the reading of his word may be
[1:31:48] seated and so we we we got here and and
[1:31:52] John had John has walked with Jesus for
[1:31:55] for for a period of time when he was
[1:31:57] here in the flesh and he's walked with
[1:31:59] him and he's had a wonderful time with
[1:32:00] him and he and he's beloved of Jesus and
[1:32:03] and he's and he's sat with him and he's
[1:32:05] and he's ate with him and he's rested
[1:32:07] his head upon his chest he loves him so
[1:32:10] much and this is this is John now is
[1:32:13] having an experience into another realm
[1:32:16] so just walking with Jesus is not enough
[1:32:18] but yet he had a wonderful time walking
[1:32:20] with him but when he sees the when he
[1:32:24] sees Jesus is he really
[1:32:28] is he says when I saw him is the one he
[1:32:32] he' lean on the his
[1:32:34] bosom he lean on his chest he heard his
[1:32:37] heartbeating R but when he saw him like
[1:32:39] this he said I fell as one
[1:32:44] dead prophet of God just comes to me
[1:32:46] prophet of God when he was with brother
[1:32:48] Bisal he says every time he comes to me
[1:32:49] like that he says it's just like I could
[1:32:51] have
[1:32:52] died you know and so there was times
[1:32:54] when we were rejoicing in that in the
[1:32:57] Lord but there's times when he comes
[1:32:58] personally to us and it's just like I
[1:33:02] could have died you
[1:33:08] know so that mystery of the Seven Stars
[1:33:11] which th sawest in my right
[1:33:12] hand the the Seven Stars are the Angels
[1:33:16] of the seven churches could we go to
[1:33:17] Isaiah now Isaiah 9
[1:33:24] 2 and 67
[1:33:26] yeah the people that walked in
[1:33:29] darkness have seen a great light they
[1:33:33] that dwell in the land of the shadow of
[1:33:34] death upon them hath the light shined

[1:35:01] shoulder but of the increase of his
[1:35:03] government and peace there shall be no
[1:35:05] end so his government isn't
[1:35:10] flatlining it's
[1:35:12] increasing that's right of the increase
[1:35:15] of his government there should be no end
[1:35:17] and his peace and his government brings
[1:35:21] peace there there
[1:35:24] there are so many people want to take us
[1:35:26] back into
[1:35:27] law and there is no peace in law because
[1:35:30] law
[1:35:33] kth
[1:35:34] right upon the throne of David upon his
[1:35:37] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[1:35:39] with just with judgment and with Justice
[1:35:41] from henceforth even
[1:35:43] forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts
[1:35:46] will perform this and so we see this and
[1:35:49] this is in the Old Testament and they're
[1:35:51] talking about this and brother brandham
[1:35:53] said that tells us that the first Bible
[1:35:56] was written in the heavens so the Bible
[1:35:59] we're reading now must align with the
[1:36:04] heavens because that's the original
[1:36:06] pattern amen already inscribed in the
[1:36:10] heavens so I want to entitle this the
[1:36:13] government shall be upon his
[1:36:18] shoulder so keep that in mind Psalms 91
[1:36:22] to6
[1:36:26] now I I was telling Brother
[1:36:29] Andy I I
[1:36:32] preached this not this message but I
[1:36:35] preached what I thought was this message
[1:36:36] back in and it might have been the late
[1:36:38] 80s or 9s so but I don't want I'm not
[1:36:41] saying that that you think oh so we're
[1:36:43] going to get old sty food but something
[1:36:47] I that happened um at her brother Marcus
[1:36:50] Becker from Germany as last Miss in
[1:36:54] 2015 when I saw you guys last uh said
[1:36:59] something to me it just spoke to me
[1:37:02] reminded me of of the of a message that
[1:37:04] I preached that I called this back then
[1:37:07] and and and then so come into my mind
[1:37:10] and then something happened I I heard
[1:37:12] somebody telling folks
[1:37:15] nonsense and I thought that's that's not
[1:37:19] message that's not right and it brought
[1:37:22] me back to this
[1:37:24] okay and uh and and but I couldn't I
[1:37:27] couldn't find out any archives so I had
[1:37:30] to do it all over again and I was seeing
[1:37:33] things I never saw in the first
[1:37:35] place of was government there should be
[1:37:37] no
[1:37:38] end we see things in the message now
[1:37:41] that we never saw for those of you that
[1:37:43] go back a long way we never saw it back
[1:37:46] then I mean you fresh people you just
[1:37:49] got it all over
[1:37:51] us we had to stagger through into we're
[1:37:53] old and and people come in and US seeing
[1:37:56] what it's taking us this amount of time
[1:37:59] to see so some haven't come on the
[1:38:02] journey some have gone on further
[1:38:04] because they got where they think to a
[1:38:05] placees but there is a wonderful balance
[1:38:07] in this man in in the word of God and in
[1:38:10] this Prophet if we keep him in in the
[1:38:12] place he's in he's he's my Joshua God
[1:38:16] through him but he's my Joshua he's not
[1:38:18] Moses I'm Not Looking Back saying yeah
[1:38:20] he just preach law
[1:38:26] amen a Psalm of David the heavens
[1:38:30] declare the glory of God and the
[1:38:31] firmament showeth his handiwork day unto
[1:38:34] Day utth speech and night unto night
[1:38:36] showeth knowledge there is no speech nor
[1:38:39] language where their voice is not
[1:38:41] heard their line and and the in the
[1:38:44] Amplified version says their voice in
[1:38:46] evidence is gone through all the Earth
[1:38:48] and their words to the end of the Earth
[1:38:49] in them hath he said set a tabernacle
[1:38:51] for the son so this is his handiwork in
[1:38:53] the heavens and it says there's no
[1:38:55] speech nor language where the voice is
[1:38:56] not
[1:38:57] heard
[1:38:59] and and that's exactly
[1:39:03] true the Seven Stars and all those
[1:39:05] things that are talking about there were
[1:39:07] people that I was talking to about
[1:39:10] this and they
[1:39:12] says I says Ah that's
[1:39:15] Miki and suddenly God has talked to
[1:39:20] all
[1:39:22] languages right
[1:39:26] which is bridegroom coming out of his
[1:39:28] chamber and rejoices as a strong man to
[1:39:30] run a race his going forth is from the
[1:39:32] end of heaven and a circuit and it means
[1:39:35] Circuit of time space under the ends of
[1:39:37] it there's nothing hid from the heat
[1:39:38] thereof so everything is written in the
[1:39:40] heavens and I tell you what that's the
[1:39:42] first the first Bible now this Bible we
[1:39:45] have now man can do all sorts of things
[1:39:46] to try and corrupt it but he can't take
[1:39:49] away from the
[1:39:51] original and the original has an
[1:39:54] influence still has an
[1:39:56] influence right we say the Bible we open
[1:39:59] it it has an influence on our life the
[1:40:01] first one has an
[1:40:04] influence that our minds and our
[1:40:06] thinking and everything can't
[1:40:07] dissipate it influences our
[1:40:12] life to the to the Natural man the Bible
[1:40:15] is just ink on paper it was to me I just
[1:40:18] thought it went before I knew the Lord I
[1:40:19] thought yeah yeah it's just a whole lot
[1:40:21] of me and I used to have an argument
[1:40:22] with a charismatic man that used to
[1:40:24] testify to
[1:40:25] me and he would just testify simply and
[1:40:29] I'd
[1:40:30] go if somebody and you feel a little
[1:40:33] connection and he's going now you know I
[1:40:35] don't believe that don't lose heart this
[1:40:38] man stayed with me I'd see him once a
[1:40:42] month for two or three years he'd be
[1:40:44] saying he just dropping something like
[1:40:46] that just he wouldn't push it and I go
[1:40:49] oh you know I don't believe that I
[1:40:50] didn't feel animosity to him I just
[1:40:52] didn't believe
[1:40:54] that you know and one day after his
[1:40:58] perseverance and because he didn't give
[1:41:00] up on me after the first try or the
[1:41:02] second try but probably around about
[1:41:06] somewhere around about the 12th 15th
[1:41:10] try see Faith cometh by hearing by the
[1:41:15] word I
[1:41:19] went and something made kind of sense
[1:41:23] but I didn't understand
[1:41:26] what but the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:41:29] it it becomes life it's just ink on
[1:41:32] paper but when to sons and daughter it
[1:41:33] becomes life amen it's a living reality
[1:41:38] just like God's first Bible in the
[1:41:39] heavens is alive and moving into
[1:41:41] positions of influence from the
[1:41:43] different for the different seasons so
[1:41:44] does the Bible and so the heavens we
[1:41:47] think we can think just I I can't
[1:41:49] comprehend it we can think what a
[1:41:50] wonderful thing that God throughout
[1:41:53] those stars and put them in their in
[1:41:55] their
[1:41:56] positions and and we think that's a
[1:41:58] wonderful thing right but it past my
[1:42:02] even thinking what a wonderful thing it
[1:42:04] is to think that when he put them there
[1:42:07] they're not
[1:42:09] static and they're moving constant
[1:42:12] they're alive constantly moving and it's
[1:42:15] and not only are they moving but he
[1:42:18] perfectly ordained them that at certain
[1:42:20] times there's an alignment made
[1:42:24] and and so when those Magi were gone
[1:42:25] down to following that start to say
[1:42:27] Jesus they were excited because they had
[1:42:29] seen in the F in the
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:39] heavens that this is the
[1:42:41] time when we read that Bible here this
[1:42:44] is the time Messiah is born
[1:42:47] yeah I didn't go down
[1:42:50] thinking oh oh that's interesting
[1:42:53] let's see where that leads they' seen
[1:42:56] that this is the time because the
[1:42:58] heavens had moved into a place at a
[1:43:01] specific that's wondrous to me that is
[1:43:05] mindboggling the billions of stars and
[1:43:08] there different influences on each other
[1:43:10] and God has it that from this little
[1:43:13] tiny planet that there's going to be be
[1:43:17] predestinated seed to look up and say
[1:43:20] and be influenced by it yeah
[1:43:28] amen and there's another season to come
[1:43:30] and it's and and stars coming into
[1:43:33] alignment and prominence to declare it's
[1:43:36] time for the voice of the seventh angel
[1:43:40] that's right right and brother Bram goes
[1:43:42] down and and the medium this is even
[1:43:45] before he comes into his ministry and
[1:43:47] this this woman says you got to I can
[1:43:50] tell you when you were born and he's
[1:43:52] like no you come you I can tell you when
[1:43:54] you were born you're born on such and
[1:43:55] such a day at such and such a time how
[1:43:57] do you know that that's right because
[1:44:00] there's a
[1:44:01] star amen is it what about me mate no no
[1:44:05] no there's nothing
[1:44:06] there she predestinated and SS of God I
[1:44:11] believe I believe that there were
[1:44:13] certain stars coming into alignment that
[1:44:15] you were born on a certain day not to be
[1:44:17] a prophet but to be a Son of God to
[1:44:20] realize your place and go and God says
[1:44:22] it's time for influence on on Ben's life
[1:44:25] it's time for an influence on Naomi's
[1:44:28] life and something was there all the
[1:44:31] time and God says it's it's time for an
[1:44:34] influence on this sister's life this
[1:44:36] brother's life it's time for an
[1:44:37] influence it's time for them to come
[1:44:39] into recognition of who they have been
[1:44:41] all
[1:44:43] along and we can say he did you see your
[1:44:45] name in the Bible but if it's in this
[1:44:48] Bible it's got to be in there too amen
[1:44:51] that's right hallelujah hallelujah I I
[1:44:55] preached this at a at a at a this is
[1:44:59] where brother Bram says if you think
[1:45:00] you're been than somebody else I
[1:45:02] preached this at a little church i' just
[1:45:04] been gone to abouted every two or three
[1:45:06] weeks and they're all new people and I
[1:45:10] tell you what I get more drawing from
[1:45:13] them than at some places I preach that
[1:45:15] have been around for a long time and
[1:45:16] know
[1:45:18] everything CU they're hungry right and
[1:45:22] when I started preaching this and I'm
[1:45:24] going to go into the into
[1:45:26] pades and they
[1:45:29] said they they they don't they don't
[1:45:32] know about they don't know about they in
[1:45:34] churches sit like this and keep very
[1:45:37] quiet still because that's the
[1:45:39] rules and so they haven't leared that
[1:45:42] the
[1:45:43] rules and the laws of the church so
[1:45:45] they're a bit noisy and they're getting
[1:45:48] quite and and and and and they're
[1:45:50] getting carried away and and I'm getting
[1:45:52] a little excited believe it or not you
[1:45:54] know yeah you say hey man that old guy's
[1:45:57] passed time for Dynamics and all that
[1:45:58] but I was getting excited because
[1:46:00] because it was a real drawing of the
[1:46:02] spirit not nonsense in the church but
[1:46:04] but they were really drawing on because
[1:46:07] because the voice of the planets is H in
[1:46:09] every nation and when I started talking
[1:46:11] about pades they said that's that's
[1:46:16] Miki and when I started talking about
[1:46:18] the sweet influences and that and then
[1:46:20] now they're aligning with Miki they says
[1:46:22] do you know afterwards they said do you
[1:46:24] know Mar rii is the start of the Mari
[1:46:26] New
[1:46:28] Year and the sweet influences of a new
[1:46:31] start and they got really
[1:46:33] excited they started getting me
[1:46:36] excited because I thought look at that
[1:46:39] I'm preaching the word and they're
[1:46:40] saying yes this is the word voices heard
[1:46:43] in every nation right down to New
[1:46:46] Zealand those stars have an influence
[1:46:48] people were already seeing this
[1:46:53] and the word Miki uh is uh it it
[1:46:57] literally means said I looked it up in a
[1:46:59] mar thing online it says it literally
[1:47:02] means the eyes of
[1:47:05] God matariki the eyes of God it's
[1:47:09] wonderful isn't
[1:47:16] it uh job n if we go to the next one
[1:47:20] brother I'm I'm I'm I'm sorry I'm just
[1:47:23] going to have to rush through these much
[1:47:26] faster than what I what I want to if I
[1:47:29] can then job answered and
[1:47:33] said I know it is so of a truth but how
[1:47:36] how should a man be just with God if he
[1:47:38] will contend with him he cannot answer
[1:47:39] him one in a thousand he is wise in
[1:47:42] heart and mighty in strength who ha
[1:47:44] hardened himself against against him and
[1:47:47] Prophets and as Prosper so he's he's
[1:47:49] talking with these guys and he's in in
[1:47:51] this but he says how can we argue you
[1:47:53] against God and prosper tell me who's
[1:47:56] done it who's ever gone against God and
[1:48:00] prospered which alone verse eight says
[1:48:03] which alone spread out the heavens and
[1:48:05] treadeth upon the waves of the sea which
[1:48:07] maketh Arcturus Orion and
[1:48:10] pleades and the chambers of the south in
[1:48:13] job 38:31 it says who can th bind the
[1:48:16] sweet influences of pleades or loose the
[1:48:18] bands of Orion can't th bring forth
[1:48:20] mezoth in the season or can't th guide
[1:48:22] aror with his sons knowest thou the
[1:48:24] ordinances of Heaven Can thou set the
[1:48:26] Dominion thereof in the earth so he's
[1:48:28] saying can man do this because he's
[1:48:30] saying God put it up there to have
[1:48:32] dominion and influences in its time and
[1:48:35] they come into place and being and and
[1:48:37] and they have influence and he says man
[1:48:39] can't do that God's placed them up there
[1:48:42] and so we find that when he's looking
[1:48:44] talking about these things and Orion is
[1:48:45] a type of Christ the the son of Iran has
[1:48:48] a serpent that's biting his
[1:48:50] heel but he's got control
[1:48:53] and it's it's it's actually a deacon
[1:48:55] part of of of the Star Sign
[1:48:57] tourus okay but but but he brings ples
[1:49:00] into it we noce he brings pades and he
[1:49:02] says they have a sweet influence those
[1:49:05] that cluster of stars have a sweet
[1:49:07] influence and the sweet influence is
[1:49:09] upon the Sons and Daughters of
[1:49:17] God
[1:49:20] numbers 23 just bear with with me I know
[1:49:23] I'm going fast
[1:49:25] I for me it's fast
[1:49:30] brother you put an old graft to us into
[1:49:32] the into the F and even that the fact
[1:49:34] that's moving that's
[1:49:38] fast and I know brother Ben or Brother
[1:49:40] Andy could have got up here and all I've
[1:49:42] done is they could have whipped through
[1:49:43] in 10 minutes they go hey let's go and
[1:49:44] have lunch but but you know I'm just a I
[1:49:47] just said all
[1:49:49] afterward and the Lord met balum I I
[1:49:53] don't want you to think I just keep it
[1:49:55] simple don't think I'm trying to confuse
[1:49:57] you I'm not um I'll only confuse myself
[1:50:01] but but but I want you I want to lead up
[1:50:04] to a picture all right and I want us to
[1:50:06] see what we
[1:50:08] follow and and who we are the Lord bent
[1:50:12] bam and put a word in his mouth and said
[1:50:14] go again unto BAC and say thus and he
[1:50:16] came in to him behold he stood by his
[1:50:18] burn offering the princes of Moab with
[1:50:20] him BAC said unto him what have the Lord
[1:50:22] spoken took up his Parable and said rise
[1:50:24] up BAC and hear haken un me th Son of
[1:50:26] zapor God is not a man that he should
[1:50:28] lie neither the son of man that he
[1:50:29] should repent hath he said and shall he
[1:50:32] not do it or hath he spoken and shall he
[1:50:33] not make it good it's like brother
[1:50:35] Brandon was saying a vision can't fail I
[1:50:37] don't care what you think I don't care
[1:50:39] what she doubts I don't care what she
[1:50:40] thinks a vision Can't Fail
[1:50:44] amen please take heart in what I brought
[1:50:46] there at the beginning because this
[1:50:48] woman had thus saith the Lord this bride
[1:50:51] has thus sayith the Lord this woman was
[1:50:54] thus sayth the Lord even even when she
[1:50:57] got a healing she still doubt the other
[1:50:58] part in that because we're still in
[1:51:01] this cursed human
[1:51:05] makeup but we have thus say the Lord and
[1:51:09] that's more than
[1:51:10] this
[1:51:13] Hallelujah behold I have received
[1:51:15] commandment to bless and he ha blessed
[1:51:17] and I cannot reverse it you want me to
[1:51:20] curse him but I have received Comm
[1:51:23] and because of what God has made me even
[1:51:25] though I I'm I'm I'm after gold and and
[1:51:27] and and everything like that and I'm
[1:51:28] easily influenced but when it comes to
[1:51:30] God I can't say except what he puts in
[1:51:33] my mouth I can't reverse it
[1:51:36] amen he says and then he goes in he says
[1:51:39] he hath not beheld iniquity in
[1:51:41] Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness
[1:51:44] in Israel the Lord his God is with them
[1:51:47] and the shout of the king is among them
[1:51:51] and in the Amplified it says God hath
[1:51:53] not beheld iniquity in Jacob for He Is
[1:51:56] Forgiven amen yes sir Hallelujah not
[1:52:00] because he suddenly got good amen that's
[1:52:03] right not because he picked his game up
[1:52:05] amen that's right but he is Forgiven I
[1:52:08] don't see iniquity there because he is
[1:52:10] Forgiven he has come to me and I and
[1:52:12] said Lord I am that man GL but Lord if
[1:52:16] you could just show me mercy and God
[1:52:18] shows him mercy and he says he's not
[1:52:20] that man anymore he's forg
[1:52:23] neither has he seen Mischief of
[1:52:24] perverseness in Israel for the same
[1:52:26] reason because he's forgiven anything
[1:52:29] that you do it anything that God does
[1:52:30] for you anything that God sees good in
[1:52:33] you is because you are
[1:52:35] forgiven not because you're big or
[1:52:37] something like that and you strut around
[1:52:40] God hates that every bit of Glory goes
[1:52:43] to him
[1:52:44] amen hallelujah in numbers uh we
[1:52:53] I just
[1:52:59] feel God verse 22 God has brought them
[1:53:02] out of out of Egypt he has as it were
[1:53:04] the strength of a
[1:53:07] unicorn surely there is no enchantment
[1:53:10] against Jacob neither is there any
[1:53:11] divination against Israel according to
[1:53:13] the time it shall be said of Jacob and
[1:53:15] of Israel what God wrought and the word
[1:53:18] unicorn there is
[1:53:20] RAM and and we're going to get into what
[1:53:23] Ram is and and and people have all
[1:53:26] different ideas of what a unicorn is and
[1:53:28] little kids know what a unicorn is it's
[1:53:30] a little pink horse with a golden snout
[1:53:33] you know and some people think it's uh
[1:53:36] you know hey if I if if you've got any
[1:53:38] pet Theory and I I say something against
[1:53:40] your pet Theory you look just forgive me
[1:53:41] and hold your pet theory if you want
[1:53:45] to I I saw this when my son is uh older
[1:53:51] than what he was
[1:53:53] I can't remember I think he's about 40
[1:53:55] coming up 40 39 or 40 but as a little
[1:53:58] boy in tanaki he called us into his room
[1:54:00] and he given his heart to the Lord at 7
[1:54:02] years old and uh and he called us into
[1:54:06] his bedroom we're out the country and
[1:54:08] he's pointing out the window and he
[1:54:09] wanted us to see something and we went
[1:54:12] to the window and we looked up and be
[1:54:14] without him pointing out we just saw
[1:54:15] what he was pointing at he was pointing
[1:54:17] at pades and it was extremely bright and
[1:54:20] where we lived there was no city lights
[1:54:23] or anything around and we were looking
[1:54:24] at
[1:54:25] pades and something struck my heart and
[1:54:28] we'd only known the Lord maybe a year or
[1:54:31] two and something struck my heart I know
[1:54:34] I didn't preach about it for another 10
[1:54:35] or 15 years but but something struck in
[1:54:38] my heart that that had an
[1:54:41] influence there was something about that
[1:54:44] I'm not a stargazer astrologer anything
[1:54:46] like that I don't have a big telescope
[1:54:48] at home but there was something in that
[1:54:50] that struck my heart and I an affinity
[1:54:53] with it I felt a connection and I
[1:54:56] couldn't understand it if you said what
[1:54:57] do you mean I couldn't I couldn't tell
[1:54:59] you all I knew was it was a connection I
[1:55:02] felt this drawing this connection I put
[1:55:05] it aside and and then some years later
[1:55:07] it came back to me when I was reading
[1:55:09] the scripture and and God reminded me of
[1:55:11] that
[1:55:20] connection as it were a unicorn
[1:55:23] now uh the next one where are we now
[1:55:26] I've tried to cut this down go and so in
[1:55:29] numbers it's once again God brought him
[1:55:31] forth out of Egypt he hath as it were
[1:55:33] the strength of a unicorn of
[1:55:35] AR he shall eat up the Nations his
[1:55:37] enemies and shall break their bones and
[1:55:39] Pierce them through with his arrows and
[1:55:41] that has a and we'll look at it a bit
[1:55:43] later but the word REM there and I've
[1:55:46] heard ministers say it's a
[1:55:48] rhinoceros well when we look at the word
[1:55:50] Unicorn through the it it that word
[1:55:52] doesn't mean rhinoceros actually when we
[1:55:55] look at through there we see some
[1:55:56] scriptures that actually identify and
[1:55:58] help us to see what this R is but it
[1:56:00] means the Primeval
[1:56:02] Ox it was actually an
[1:56:05] ox and uh and it and because it's as far
[1:56:10] as they know it's extinct now then then
[1:56:13] man thinks well if it's not around where
[1:56:15] it can't be but it was and Julius Caesar
[1:56:17] H and so forth we'll get into that a
[1:56:18] little bit uh in time now the sign if we
[1:56:23] go to the next one this is this is the
[1:56:24] ARX this is what we call as
[1:56:28] Taurus and this is the rim this is the
[1:56:31] Oro whatever you like but this is the
[1:56:33] rim and so if it's in God's Bible it's
[1:56:36] got to be in the heavens and this is
[1:56:37] where it's in the
[1:56:40] heavens and and it and it's Taurus is
[1:56:43] the
[1:56:45] Judgment the Judgment that's what it
[1:56:48] means in the great judgment period which
[1:56:49] begins at the house of God by catching
[1:56:51] way of God's just hold it on there for a
[1:56:53] while Brother
[1:56:56] Andy
[1:56:59] uh and uh sorry it begins at the house
[1:57:03] of God by the catching away of God's
[1:57:05] ready and waiting bride to himself in
[1:57:06] the Heavenly regions and then breaks in
[1:57:08] Fury upon the ungodly population still
[1:57:11] left on Earth so this is the time of the
[1:57:13] Judgment God's going to take his people
[1:57:15] and then comes the judgment and then it
[1:57:17] is that Jehovah's enemies Shall Perish
[1:57:19] and all the workers of iniquity shall be
[1:57:21] scattered and the the Horn of the seed
[1:57:23] of the woman shall be exalted like the
[1:57:24] Horn of the rim to fulfill his desire
[1:57:27] upon his foes which is which is the
[1:57:29] precise seene pictorial pictorial
[1:57:32] represented in the sign of Taurus the
[1:57:34] names in the sign in Hebrew AR Arabic
[1:57:37] Syria Latin and Greek mean the same as
[1:57:39] the English name the
[1:57:41] bull it so the voice goes to all the
[1:57:44] heaven you know through all through all
[1:57:46] the
[1:57:47] Earth but the figure is not that of the
[1:57:50] common bull or of any known class the
[1:57:51] horns are greater and differently set
[1:57:53] from those of domestic cattle the
[1:57:55] attitude and energy displayed are
[1:57:57] likewise far fiercer and more Nimble
[1:57:59] than the common arc ever shows so we
[1:58:01] have the scripture then of in
[1:58:04] Psalms the voice of the Lord break of
[1:58:06] the seed is yay the Lord break the seed
[1:58:07] is the Lebanon he Mak them also to skip
[1:58:09] like the calf like a cal Lebanon and
[1:58:11] Syria like a young unicorn um
[1:58:13] rhinoceroses don't
[1:58:17] skip if you thought it was a rhinoceros
[1:58:20] or somebody's telling you the rhinoceros
[1:58:21] you
[1:58:22] no they don't
[1:58:24] skip but oxes do I've been I've been a
[1:58:27] farmer most of my life and uh and I tell
[1:58:30] you what you see cars skipping and and
[1:58:32] and and sometimes they're just out there
[1:58:34] and the Sun starts to warm them up and
[1:58:36] they're just walking and the next minute
[1:58:38] it looks like they have a fit they're
[1:58:39] just skipping around with a exuberance
[1:58:42] of Youth
[1:58:44] amen that's only a past memory for me
[1:58:47] but but but youth has
[1:58:50] exuberance unless it's buried on
[1:58:52] Facebook or something but these days but
[1:58:55] in my day yeah we were outside all the
[1:58:57] time when we were young you couldn't
[1:58:58] keep us inside beo foot and muddy amen
[1:59:02] so it's not some mythological fantasy
[1:59:04] created in the mind of man and this is
[1:59:06] what man's mind comes up with
[1:59:09] also that is not a unicorn that is that
[1:59:14] to me is a travesty because that's
[1:59:16] satanic that's bringing into because
[1:59:18] it's taking the word of God you know it
[1:59:20] might seem as humorous and and and in a
[1:59:23] way it is but in another way it's it's
[1:59:25] ungodly it's Satan going I am going to
[1:59:28] take the word of God and I'm going to
[1:59:29] transform and if they can't believe it's
[1:59:31] a unicorn then I'll make it some myth
[1:59:33] some Fantastical creature with a go horn
[1:59:36] of gold and and all that and then then
[1:59:39] because Satan wants to work on the young
[1:59:40] children then he comes then he comes to
[1:59:43] a uh to another one next one brother and
[1:59:47] so for the children he makes it
[1:59:50] this and and we get get it for the kids
[1:59:52] and you know and hey you're not going to
[1:59:54] hell if you got one for your
[1:59:57] kids but I wouldn't get one for your
[1:59:59] kids
[2:00:02] now brother BR I was going to buy one
[2:00:04] this weekend my little
[2:00:07] Georgia I kind of
[2:00:09] wouldn't and
[2:00:12] uh I I kind of think we might have had
[2:00:14] one for our kids way back so that all
[2:00:17] popular you know but but it's just Satan
[2:00:21] pulling down God it's just another
[2:00:22] father Christmas it's a Santa Claus it's
[2:00:25] it's just nonsense amen we've got such a
[2:00:28] pure word of
[2:00:34] God it's just another way that Satan
[2:00:36] amans and ridicules the word of God is
[2:00:39] the it is the REM of the T the Oro the
[2:00:40] bull of your the fierce Mighty and
[2:00:42] untamable Wild Bull of the Prime Evil
[2:00:44] Ages and a most expressive symbol AS
[2:00:47] Christ as the irresistible and angry
[2:00:50] judge the mighty creatures is now as far
[2:00:53] as not entirely extinct what once common
[2:00:55] in North uh Western Asia or Syria and
[2:00:58] and middle Europe remains of it have
[2:01:01] been have of late years been discovered
[2:01:03] in the north of Palestine and Julius
[2:01:05] Caesar in the account of his Wars
[2:01:06] describes it as being hunted in the
[2:01:08] something forest in his day it was known
[2:01:11] as the Primeval ARX or while built
[2:01:13] different altogether from the Bison of
[2:01:14] the great anop sometimes taking for it
[2:01:16] it was a formidable animal scarcely less
[2:01:20] this is from history this is from the
[2:01:22] ones that saw it scarcely less than an
[2:01:26] elephant in size this was
[2:01:33] huge but in nature color and form a true
[2:01:37] Ox its strength and speed were very
[2:01:39] great and was so Fierce that it did not
[2:01:41] spear man or beast when it caught sight
[2:01:43] of them this was an animal that even if
[2:01:45] captured as a cal could never be
[2:01:47] domesticated by man to me it's a perfect
[2:01:50] type of Christ because you cannot man
[2:01:52] cannot domesticate Christ amen man tries
[2:01:56] and he tries and he tries to bring
[2:01:58] people under his influence to to to
[2:02:00] realize that you know this is Christ and
[2:02:02] they put him in a box and Christ like
[2:02:04] this Ox he just breaks it a
[2:02:09] free
[2:02:12] Hallelujah I I this is this is just Bru
[2:02:15] I I believe this is the Lord but this B
[2:02:18] is me because I can't I can't show you
[2:02:20] in the Scripture it is
[2:02:22] but when I when I see
[2:02:24] this with these horns and then I go to
[2:02:28] zedekiah who is under an anointing with
[2:02:32] all his men they're having a convention
[2:02:34] another thing too that comes to my mind
[2:02:36] is when zedekiah and all these are
[2:02:37] having this wonderful anointed I mean
[2:02:39] inspiration
[2:02:40] flowing M wasn't with them ever thought
[2:02:44] of that M wasn't he hadn't attended the
[2:02:46] convention but they having this
[2:02:47] wonderful thing and then zedekiah under
[2:02:49] this anointing and under this impression
[2:02:51] forms himself a pair of horns and said
[2:02:53] we're going to
[2:02:55] drive this is this is just bro but I
[2:02:59] believe that because they were there in
[2:03:01] his day that he fashioned those horns
[2:03:03] after the or after the
[2:03:06] ram because that was what they do you
[2:03:09] couldn't domesticate
[2:03:12] it in Job 3 39 and 9-2 it says will the
[2:03:17] Unicorn be willing to serve thee or
[2:03:19] abide by th crib can thou bind the
[2:03:22] unicorn with his Bandon in the F will he
[2:03:24] Harrow the fields valleys after the you
[2:03:26] know it's talking about because that's
[2:03:28] what they did they used oxes to do it
[2:03:30] but he's saying you can't domesticate
[2:03:32] this thing can you can you use it for
[2:03:34] plowing can you do work with it you
[2:03:36] can't do work with
[2:03:37] it will th believe him that he'll bring
[2:03:40] home thy seed and gather into thy
[2:03:48] Barn I'm just I'm just feeling time gone
[2:03:51] there
[2:03:52] now can you give me a bit more
[2:03:55] time fine Brother B if it's just getting
[2:03:59] too long just get up and go cut you know
[2:04:01] if you suddenly see me flat down they go
[2:04:04] like that you know that brother Ben's
[2:04:05] just stood up
[2:04:07] right and if you need hey if you're
[2:04:10] getting tired of me you know I'm just a
[2:04:11] normal guy you know just stand up and
[2:04:13] you need to stretch your legs I
[2:04:16] just and sit down again that'll be fine
[2:04:18] with me I don't want to tie you out I'm
[2:04:20] very conscious of that
[2:04:24] um in the days of Julia Caesar that the
[2:04:26] the hunters it would be a massive thing
[2:04:28] if they could if they could kill one and
[2:04:30] what they used to do the main one was to
[2:04:33] dig big pits and kill it in the pit
[2:04:36] because you didn't want to go up against
[2:04:37] it with a horse on that and and fair
[2:04:39] enough hey it's a it's nearly the size
[2:04:41] of an elephant but it's got
[2:04:44] horns
[2:04:46] and and so so people were yeah they
[2:04:49] they'd parade the horns around if they
[2:04:50] could kill one they'd take the horns off
[2:04:51] he was a hero he killed a he killed the
[2:04:54] a
[2:04:58] unicorn and so this terrific animal
[2:05:01] appears here in that in that what we
[2:05:03] were looking that sign we're looking at
[2:05:06] dashing forth with Swift and impetuous
[2:05:07] energy and with his great sharp horn set
[2:05:09] as if to run through everything that
[2:05:10] comes in its way the Egyptian called it
[2:05:12] by name signifying the head the captain
[2:05:15] the mighty Chieftain who
[2:05:17] cometh this is the Egyptians so this is
[2:05:20] this is not just Israel but there was
[2:05:21] seeing it in the same way you know the
[2:05:23] chief star in the sign is situated in
[2:05:25] the bullseye and it name alabon means
[2:05:28] the captain leader or
[2:05:31] Governor the middle part and the middle
[2:05:36] and hinder part of the enraged animal
[2:05:37] includes the body of the
[2:05:39] enthroned Lamb out of which it seems to
[2:05:41] rise so Taurus is coming out of the lamb
[2:05:43] and if we could go to the next
[2:05:44] one I've Circle that there that's that's
[2:05:47] Aries that's the that's the lamb and
[2:05:50] this this this might
[2:05:52] judgment is actually coming out of the
[2:05:58] Lamb amen when John walked with Jesus he
[2:06:03] leaned on the bosom of the
[2:06:05] lamb but when he saw him with those eyes
[2:06:08] are like furnaces of fire and so
[2:06:11] forth he was seeing this guy amen we
[2:06:16] can't keep Jesus a
[2:06:19] Doty but to us he's the lamb amen yes
[2:06:23] sir but to the
[2:06:24] enemy is the mighty
[2:06:29] Ram is this is this
[2:06:32] okay
[2:06:34] amen I preach this in this little church
[2:06:37] that that that's um this is my time gone
[2:06:41] but in a little church I've gone to and
[2:06:44] the brother and the sister were sitting
[2:06:46] behind a couple that were probably in
[2:06:47] their late 30s early
[2:06:49] 40s and I still getting really excited
[2:06:53] and as I was bringing this the they told
[2:06:56] me
[2:06:56] afterwards the two people sitting in
[2:06:59] front of them like going to the church
[2:07:01] for the atmosphere and that but actually
[2:07:03] didn't see their emphasis upon a prophet
[2:07:06] of God and as I was preaching this they
[2:07:09] saw the people in front of
[2:07:12] them
[2:07:15] ah and it was this not talking about a
[2:07:18] prophet of God but this that they
[2:07:20] realized
[2:07:22] how important the prophet of God
[2:07:28] is this remarkably interprets with the
[2:07:31] reference to Christ in his church and
[2:07:32] the anger which he is to visit the
[2:07:34] Wicked World after the Church of the
[2:07:36] firstborn has been safely landed in
[2:07:37] heaven toward his church he's the lamb
[2:07:39] but towards the unsanctified world he
[2:07:41] finally becomes a terrible
[2:07:43] RAM and we see something else quite
[2:07:46] striking in connection with the sign
[2:07:48] among the Earthly Nations there was a
[2:07:49] widespread idea connecting this bull
[2:07:52] with the Deluge the flood and the pades
[2:07:56] the Seven Stars the dove the pecul star
[2:07:58] cluster of sweet influences with the
[2:08:01] with the Ark of no and those say but and
[2:08:02] that's where they they went with no the
[2:08:04] Judgment but we know by the word of God
[2:08:07] that that's not that's not the case and
[2:08:09] so they they
[2:08:13] uh but right through the world they were
[2:08:15] seeing these things and trying to put it
[2:08:17] up the Seven Stars which the scriptures
[2:08:19] connected with with Christ in
[2:08:22] Revelations 1:16 are on the back of this
[2:08:25] bull high up on its shoulder and the
[2:08:28] government shall be upon his shoulder
[2:08:31] where the thing right where the
[2:08:33] government and this is where that's
[2:08:35] where the government resides the Seven
[2:08:36] Stars that were in his hand signifying
[2:08:38] Christ control of those Seven Stars
[2:08:41] remember in in in Revelation we read
[2:08:44] that that it when he saw this Vision he
[2:08:47] said and in his right hand were seven
[2:08:50] stars and I fell as one dead and what
[2:08:53] did God do he puts his right hand on him
[2:08:56] and says fear
[2:08:58] not the right hand that's got the Stars
[2:09:01] he puts it on him type it John type of
[2:09:03] the bride and he says puts the Stars on
[2:09:05] him and says fear
[2:09:06] not fear
[2:09:09] not you're reing my
[2:09:15] governance I am a fearful
[2:09:18] God but to my bride don't fear me
[2:09:22] but I'm going to give you governance to
[2:09:25] lead you and to guide you not by
[2:09:28] laws not by laure in any way but I'm
[2:09:31] going to give you
[2:09:33] government to allow you to follow
[2:09:36] me that you can go back to and say what
[2:09:39] am I to do here and well well sister I I
[2:09:43] I you know I wouldn't catch you here you
[2:09:46] know it's not
[2:09:48] law but God brought Grace to us Amen in
[2:09:52] the form of his Prophet which was his
[2:09:54] government government for the bride
[2:09:57] that's why Satan wants to use man to try
[2:09:59] to deal with it to break it away from us
[2:10:02] to break us away from that
[2:10:06] government I I like what brother Marcus
[2:10:09] said sorry I'm gonna reverence brother
[2:10:11] Marcus but I I just I just
[2:10:15] C I was going through something oh man
[2:10:18] my Thum I was going through something
[2:10:19] with with and and a brother rich Richard
[2:10:21] Oliver was staying with me over th the
[2:10:23] days of the convention and something
[2:10:25] happened and and I said Brother
[2:10:29] Richard when brother Marcus Bea preached
[2:10:32] his last message I knew he was under
[2:10:35] inspiration okay and he prayed for some
[2:10:38] people and I said Richard he's under
[2:10:40] inspiration I'm going up and not saying
[2:10:43] anything and brother Marcus come down
[2:10:46] Richard knew what my my question was
[2:10:48] brother marus come down and and I said
[2:10:51] Just prayed for my brother and I was
[2:10:53] waiting for it I was I was trying to
[2:10:54] draw it Lord I want to hear from you
[2:10:56] because I want to know and he prayed for
[2:10:58] me when I went back to Brother Richard
[2:11:01] he says because he wasn't far away he
[2:11:03] was just sitting there just sitting
[2:11:04] there he
[2:11:05] said did I hear him say what I thought
[2:11:08] he said I says you sure
[2:11:11] did he addressed it you see the
[2:11:15] government should be upon his shoulder
[2:11:16] but one of the things that he said was
[2:11:18] and I have a struggle with is that
[2:11:20] people I talk with people and they say
[2:11:22] and I said Hey Brother B never said that
[2:11:24] yeah he
[2:11:26] did I said no he he didn't you know the
[2:11:29] balance is on our inside we got to have
[2:11:31] a witness and I thought I don't witness
[2:11:34] you know maybe I haven't I haven't read
[2:11:35] everything but or or got a memory that I
[2:11:39] can but it didn't witness with the
[2:11:41] message that I follow and I
[2:11:44] says and and and and his brother older
[2:11:47] brother he says he
[2:11:50] did I said no no he didn't and then a
[2:11:54] sister that was sitting there was about
[2:11:55] four people with me she said I just read
[2:11:57] it two days
[2:12:01] ago and I said because saints of God
[2:12:06] there's no way I want to tell you
[2:12:08] something that the prophet didn't say
[2:12:12] and also I don't want to say he didn't
[2:12:14] say something that he did say so I said
[2:12:17] to them still without a witness in my
[2:12:18] heart I says can you forgive me and how
[2:12:21] I've missed that but all the time I
[2:12:23] saying Lord why why aren't I feeling
[2:12:26] your your
[2:12:28] witness they went to make a cup of tea
[2:12:30] and I said I'll just sit here and I I
[2:12:31] went through my iPad and I I looked and
[2:12:33] I narrowed the field down and I and I
[2:12:35] and I tried to find it I went
[2:12:38] in and I says
[2:12:40] brother can you tell
[2:12:43] me where he says that I can't find it he
[2:12:48] says well maybe he didn't say it maybe
[2:12:50] somebody else said it
[2:12:53] and I thought I went through agonies
[2:12:55] even not having a witness I were right
[2:12:57] but but I went in case I'd said
[2:12:59] something the prophet said one way or
[2:13:00] the other see that's how important it is
[2:13:02] to me but to this brother well maybe
[2:13:04] somebody didn't care Saints I hold us
[2:13:07] dear to me my life is resting upon this
[2:13:11] and then and the
[2:13:13] sister and I looked at her and I says
[2:13:15] but well no no it wasn't by the brother

[2:19:21] and their land shall be soaked with

[2:19:25] for it is the day of the Lord's
[2:19:26] Vengeance and the and the year of
[2:19:28] recompenses to the controversy of
[2:19:30] Zion in
[2:19:37] Deuteronomy just hold it there just the
[2:19:40] thoughts come no no no it's all right
[2:19:41] it's right just bear with me don't look
[2:19:43] at
[2:19:46] that Joshua is
[2:19:49] Grace Moses is LA
[2:19:52] Joshua goes into into Jericho and he
[2:19:54] takes the people into Jericho and they
[2:19:55] take
[2:19:57] Jericho right
[2:20:00] Grace and and Grace says to the two
[2:20:03] spices says go and get the
[2:20:06] hot and not just a harlot this is Grace
[2:20:09] we can see this he is not just the
[2:20:11] Harlot but a family and everything and
[2:20:15] bring them to me right and we go see
[2:20:20] that's great Lord she's aot she's not
[2:20:22] only aot she's not even part of Israel
[2:20:24] she should be
[2:20:26] killed by Grace saves the hot and her
[2:20:32] family with the red
[2:20:36] thread and they won a great Victory on
[2:20:39] this massive City and then Joshua sends
[2:20:42] people down to
[2:20:44] to a town of a place of a city of AI I
[2:20:48] don't care how you spell pronounce it
[2:20:49] doesn't matter but but he sends them
[2:20:51] down and they go down and they come back
[2:20:52] and they says hey don't send a whole lot
[2:20:55] down it's just a little city after the
[2:20:57] victory we' had here this is easy peasy
[2:21:00] two 3,000 take it easy because they had
[2:21:04] this wonderful
[2:21:05] Victory but while they're having this
[2:21:07] wonderful
[2:21:08] Victory
[2:21:10] aen takes to the accursed
[2:21:14] thing right and so Joshua sends them
[2:21:18] down just two or 3,000
[2:21:22] and to this little easy peasy place and
[2:21:24] this little easy peasy place routs them
[2:21:27] and 36 men die none die in Jericho but
[2:21:30] in this little easy peasy bit of
[2:21:33] warfare and and they come back and
[2:21:36] Joshua is is distraught and Joshua lays
[2:21:41] on his face and he's saying Lord why did
[2:21:43] we even come across
[2:21:46] Jordan amen if you got the Holy Spirit
[2:21:50] and you have time you say Lord what is
[2:21:51] this
[2:21:52] happening don't let Satan tell you you
[2:21:55] haven't got the Holy Spirit the holy
[2:21:57] spirit in
[2:21:59] Joshua amen could start the
[2:22:03] question and so when we hear of Joshua
[2:22:05] we're talking of Joshua we see of Joshua
[2:22:07] and the scriptures we just see this
[2:22:08] mighty man of God he's Victorious and he
[2:22:11] is but it doesn't mean he doesn't have
[2:22:13] moments moments of
[2:22:15] trial hen yourself with that I just want
[2:22:18] to encourage you don't let that devil
[2:22:21] cause your cause the doubt that he can
[2:22:23] bring into your Battlefield to cause you
[2:22:26] to wonder whether you even got the holy
[2:22:28] spirit
[2:22:30] amen and God says to Joshua he says he
[2:22:34] says what are you doing land down like
[2:22:36] this see God does Lord I'm your son why
[2:22:39] you talk like that to me what are you
[2:22:42] doing here get
[2:22:44] up he said the reason that this has
[2:22:46] happened isn't because I brought you
[2:22:48] over Jordan the reason this has happened
[2:22:50] isn't because you haven't got faith the
[2:22:52] reason that this has happened is because
[2:22:55] there's a cursed thing has been brought
[2:22:57] into the
[2:22:59] body Joshua's Grace we just saw it with
[2:23:04] Rahab it says actually says Joshua says
[2:23:06] because she hid The Messengers that
[2:23:08] Joshua sent she found that Grace
[2:23:11] Hallelujah this man he h he also hides
[2:23:15] something but he's not hiding the
[2:23:16] messengers of Grace that Joshua sent
[2:23:19] he's hiding the accursed thing in his
[2:23:23] tent and so so it singles
[2:23:27] out and now Grace says why have you done
[2:23:31] this and Grace says under Moses when
[2:23:34] when people did things wrong under
[2:23:36] Moses God says to Moses Moses just stand
[2:23:40] back and God smites him with fire and
[2:23:43] things open up and smitten with fire and
[2:23:44] so forth Moses didn't have to do it un
[2:23:48] Joshua Joshua says take him
[2:23:51] Grace says take him I'm not having any
[2:23:54] accursed thing we can't have an accursed
[2:23:57] thing God won't even hear us while
[2:23:59] that's in the
[2:24:00] church and take him and take see the
[2:24:05] parallel to the Other Extreme with Rahab
[2:24:08] he says take him and his and his family
[2:24:13] and his children and his oxen and
[2:24:16] everything he has and stone him and burn
[2:24:18] him with fire that's our Grace you can't
[2:24:22] have Grace one side and Grace the other
[2:24:24] see the people think Grace is
[2:24:27] hey that's why they want to put Prophet
[2:24:29] off the scene that's why they want to
[2:24:31] make the prophet
[2:24:32] Moses amen it's not it's not for
[2:24:35] preachers to preach law and and
[2:24:36] everything that's not and bring people
[2:24:37] under under subjection and that but it
[2:24:40] is to say let God get rid of the
[2:24:44] accursed thing amen hallelujah
[2:24:52] I'll just be a few M moments more now
[2:24:54] coming down is that right coming down I
[2:24:56] I do want to get to
[2:24:58] this and Joseph and brother Bram said I
[2:25:01] read that Bible and there was a man that
[2:25:02] was nothing against Abraham Isaac Jacob
[2:25:04] and all of them had something against
[2:25:06] them but not Joseph what a man a perfect
[2:25:09] man a perfect type of Christ okay so now
[2:25:12] we're talking about Joseph and let's say
[2:25:14] a perfect type of Christ we're talking
[2:25:15] about
[2:25:16] Christ and he said blessed the Lord be
[2:25:19] his land for the PRI precious things of
[2:25:20] Heaven for the Jew and for the deep that
[2:25:22] couches beneath and for the precious
[2:25:25] fruits brought
[2:25:27] forth things of the earth and fullness
[2:25:30] thereof for the Good Will of him that
[2:25:31] dwelleth in the bush that dwell in the
[2:25:33] bush let the blessing come upon the head
[2:25:36] of
[2:25:38] Joseph let the blessing come upon the
[2:25:40] head of
[2:25:43] Joseph and upon the top of the head of
[2:25:46] him that was separated from his Brethren
[2:25:48] this is Joseph and hisor GL is like the
[2:25:50] firstling of his
[2:25:52] bulock and his horns are like the horns
[2:25:54] of unicorns he's talking about the
[2:25:56] perfect type of Christ his horns are
[2:25:58] like the horns of unicorns with them
[2:26:01] shall he push the people together to the
[2:26:03] ends of the Earth and they are the
[2:26:05] 10,000s this is the sons of the sons of
[2:26:09] Joseph are the horns of Joseph that are
[2:26:13] going to conquer he says and with these
[2:26:15] horns of
[2:26:17] Joseph they shall push the he he shall
[2:26:20] he shall Joseph push the people together
[2:26:23] to the ends of the Earth and they are
[2:26:24] the 10,000s of Ephraim and they are the
[2:26:26] thousands of Manasseh Joseph so Jose and
[2:26:30] that's it brother Joseph and I'm closing
[2:26:32] now in a superiority of power is likened
[2:26:34] to the
[2:26:36] rim this Joseph can't be domesticated is
[2:26:40] what and this is under an anointing when
[2:26:43] he's blessing
[2:26:45] Joseph brother B said perfect type of
[2:26:47] Christ he said
[2:26:52] is liken to the rim of which his two
[2:26:53] sons Ephraim and Manasseh were the two
[2:26:55] great horns which were to P push the
[2:26:57] people to the ends of the Earth and to
[2:26:59] this Mighty untamable and Invincible ARX
[2:27:01] the Messiah Compares himself in
[2:27:03] connection with a great judgment upon
[2:27:05] this wicked world for then his horn
[2:27:07] shall be exalted like the Horn of the
[2:27:08] rim towards his church he is the lamb
[2:27:10] but towards the unsanctified world he
[2:27:12] finally becomes a temporal Rim if we
[2:27:14] looking at that type and says to God I I
[2:27:17] read this out in three meetings and I
[2:27:20] of that little
[2:27:23] church speaking to these new people and
[2:27:26] I and they caught it the same time as I
[2:27:28] did and I didn't see the type I'm
[2:27:31] talking about I didn't see but we are
[2:27:34] those horns of Christ that Christ is
[2:27:35] going to drive them with and I tell you
[2:27:37] what when I saw it as I'm preaching I
[2:27:39] couldn't I couldn't keep
[2:27:40] talking the enormity and so we think oh
[2:27:43] we're just
[2:27:45] nobody you know brother Bram says in a
[2:27:47] place he says you know hey you can you
[2:27:49] know you can preach that's all right and
[2:27:51] that just live your life he says what
[2:27:53] what what we need now is thousands of
[2:27:55] lives lived he says he says swelling
[2:27:58] words and preaching like Billy Graham
[2:28:01] and all that he says that that the devil
[2:28:03] can laugh at that but he says what
[2:28:05] really shakes the enemy it's to see a
[2:28:08] life am it's to see a life you know and
[2:28:11] you say Lord I want to do something for
[2:28:13] you if you're just living a life and
[2:28:16] people are watching you all the time and
[2:28:18] they
[2:28:21] Saints we might think we're just nobody
[2:28:24] and that's pretty good because you can
[2:28:27] they can help keep you humble you know I
[2:28:30] I hear heard preacher say like Paul you
[2:28:33] know well yeah when Paul was saying the
[2:28:35] things I do I do not da and I said well
[2:28:37] that was when he was a teenager or a
[2:28:39] youth
[2:28:40] no Paul was fighting the flesh all the
[2:28:43] time but he overcome because his faith
[2:28:46] wasn't in this but his faith and trust
[2:28:48] was in who he was yes sir who had called
[2:28:51] him amen and my faith is in what I can
[2:28:53] do or anything but my faith is in what
[2:28:56] he's
[2:28:57] done I don't want to try to govern
[2:29:00] anybody why wouldn't I want to try and
[2:29:02] impose my government on
[2:29:05] anybody amen because I have a
[2:29:09] governor amen I have a
[2:29:13] government I don't need
[2:29:15] any praise the Lord look Saints I
[2:29:20] thank you for putting up with an old
[2:29:22] man but don't talk negative about
[2:29:25] yourself don't allow Satan to bring
[2:29:27] negative sure we confess our
[2:29:32] faults once said can I just one more I'm
[2:29:36] breaking my word all the time said I'm
[2:29:38] closing
[2:29:39] that I had a situation once many years
[2:29:42] ago and I might have testified once when
[2:29:44] I've been down before but this is years
[2:29:46] ago and a door swung was halfast 8 at
[2:29:49] night had I on the Lord very long don't
[2:29:51] think because somebody's got a bit of
[2:29:53] time on them that they know things that
[2:29:55] you can't know the fact that we know
[2:29:58] Jesus is all we need to

[2:31:23] she she was really desperate and we went
[2:31:26] up and she says I don't know what's
[2:31:28] wrong but something's just twisting his
[2:31:30] body and and he thinks he's dying I
[2:31:32] think he's dying we went up and the and
[2:31:36] as I went through the bedroom door and
[2:31:38] his the headboard of the bed's here by
[2:31:41] the door and he's like this and as we
[2:31:43] went in I saw this this thing about this
[2:31:45] far out a demon and I just s go back
[2:31:48] into him and I knew so I knew I was
[2:31:51] dealing we dealing with a demon I'm a
[2:31:52] very young Christian you don't have to
[2:31:54] be an old Christian before you could
[2:31:55] deal with demons he you just got to
[2:31:57] trust
[2:31:58] him and uh we went in now this other
[2:32:01] brother I I let him do the leading of
[2:32:03] things and I didn't say anything and we
[2:32:06] prayed till I think it was nearly half 1
[2:32:08] in the morning and nothing was happening
[2:32:11] and this thing would just all of a
[2:32:12] sudden grab and his whole body would
[2:32:14] twist and he'd scream that was a
[2:32:15] horrible thing but I I actually because
[2:32:17] I'd seen what I saw I wasn't looking at
[2:32:19] what was happening to him in the in a
[2:32:22] way that I thought Lord you showed me
[2:32:24] that for a reason so I'll just wait
[2:32:27] sometimes we just need to wait amen oh I
[2:32:30] know what it is and waited and so after
[2:32:33] a time it was about 1 half 1 in the
[2:32:35] morning the brother he'd had a he'd had
[2:32:37] enough and he was getting tired and I'd
[2:32:39] just been sitting there all the time
[2:32:40] just praying just saying Lord what would
[2:32:42] you have me do and so they went out he
[2:32:45] wanted a cup of tea and they went out
[2:32:47] when they went out I was left alone with
[2:32:48] the brother and now I now I got it from
[2:32:51] the Lord what to do so Lord just leave
[2:32:54] me and I said brother I said you've done
[2:32:58] something and this is caused by you've
[2:33:00] done something and it's caused it's
[2:33:02] caused the demon to come in and I said
[2:33:05] I've seen it and I says you need
[2:33:06] deliverance from
[2:33:07] that and he says no I haven't done and
[2:33:10] and this thing happened again and so
[2:33:13] because it it happened again he he says
[2:33:16] oh you know and he told me something
[2:33:18] from his past
[2:33:21] and I
[2:33:23] said I couldn't tell you what he said
[2:33:25] because I knew I had I was waiting on
[2:33:27] the Lord and I said brother that's not
[2:33:29] it because the Lord never showed it to
[2:33:31] me you know brother brand said if the
[2:33:34] Lord done he couldn't if you do
[2:33:35] something the Lord can't show it even to
[2:33:38] his prophet and I said brother and I got
[2:33:40] and what it was I had no witness nope
[2:33:43] not that and he told me about three
[2:33:45] things so he brought three things he
[2:33:48] allowed three things to come out of his
[2:33:50] past that were dealt
[2:33:54] with we shouldn't let Satan bring th
[2:33:56] things up out of our past you know
[2:33:59] remember when you did
[2:34:01] that Satan that was that's dealt with
[2:34:04] that's your that's your that's your
[2:34:06] that's your problem you know and then
[2:34:08] the brother told me something it wasn't
[2:34:09] very it would not seem very much and now
[2:34:13] I I knew what and then I the Lord showed
[2:34:15] me that was it I said oh brother now we
[2:34:17] can pray and that thing left him amen
[2:34:20] came out of him left him never had
[2:34:21] another problem after that you know but
[2:34:24] but what I wanted to say was that the
[2:34:26] devil was saying you did this you did
[2:34:28] this and here he is an extreme he's
[2:34:30] bringing things up that go when it's
[2:34:33] dealt with it's done right since when
[2:34:36] it's dealt with it's done if Satan tries
[2:34:38] to tell you yeah about call yourself a
[2:34:40] Christian what what about when you did
[2:34:42] such and such don't even don't even
