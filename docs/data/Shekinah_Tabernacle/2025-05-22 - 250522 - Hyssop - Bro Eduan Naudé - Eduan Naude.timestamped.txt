[30:06] let's read uh a few scriptures
[30:10] we'll start with a couple
[30:13] i don't know if i'm putting someone on
[30:14] pressure but uh on on the spot but
[30:17] were we not supposed to have a special
[30:19] tonight
[30:21] i don't know was that is it for
[30:22] afterwards
[30:24] oh okay
[30:26] [Music]
[30:27] i thought so okay well
[30:29] i prepared better okay
[30:32] hopefully hopefully it'll come
[30:33] afterwards
[30:36] okay let's see if i can drive hey
[30:39] there we go
[30:41] exodus 12
[30:42] verse 21 to 24.
[30:47] then moses
[30:49] now this is very very familiar to you
[30:52] this is nothing i i'm absolutely i'm not
[30:54] bringing you anything new anything
[30:56] anything new but
[30:58] um
[30:59] and and some testimonies will come later
[31:01] on that i want to refer to um it is now
[31:05] the time that this needs to be preached
[31:07] i've um i've talked to brother ben
[31:10] and what he's brought over the pulpit as
[31:12] recently as this sunday it is all lining
[31:15] up and i
[31:16] said brother ben
[31:20] they're going to think i'm
[31:21] just just stealing your notes i'm just
[31:23] taking your you know he said no no you
[31:25] claim it you claim it first you you go
[31:28] with it so this thought started when i
[31:30] was supposed to bring a message uh
[31:33] oh when i had covered or when our family
[31:35] was sort of um not be able to come here
[31:39] so within that time i was i was getting
[31:41] these thoughts and then all put it
[31:43] together but yes thank you brother ben
[31:45] that um
[31:46] that you kind in that way
[31:48] let's read then moses called for all the
[31:50] elders of israel and sit unto them draw
[31:53] out and take you a lamb according to
[31:56] your families and kill the
[31:58] and kill the passover and you shall take
[32:00] a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the
[32:02] blood and that is in the basin
[32:05] strike the lintel and the two side posts
[32:08] with the blood that is in the basin and
[32:10] none of you shall go out at the door of
[32:12] his house until the morning for the lord
[32:15] will pass through
[32:16] to smite the egyptians and when he seeth
[32:19] the blood
[32:20] uh upon the lintel and on the two side
[32:23] post the lord will pass over the door
[32:26] and will not suffer the destroyer to
[32:28] come in unto the house to smite you and
[32:31] he shall observe this thing for an
[32:33] ordinance to thee and to thy sons
[32:36] forever
[32:39] and then one
[32:40] let's see if i can there we go
[32:43] psalm 51
[32:45] i've said verse 7 that's just sort of
[32:47] the highlight here but
[32:49] let's read
[32:51] behold thou desires truth in the inward
[32:54] parts and the hidden path that shall
[32:57] make me to known wisdom
[33:00] purge me with hyssop and i shall be
[33:02] clean and wash me and i shall be whiter
[33:04] than snow make me to hear joy and
[33:06] gladness that the bones that what which
[33:10] thou has broken may rejoice and we know
[33:13] about the lamb
[33:15] that was broken you may have your seeds
[33:17] god bless this
[33:18] word that is
[33:20] truly living
[33:22] in this day
[33:24] i was quickly trying to find what is a
[33:26] good definition of awesome it's just a
[33:29] such a powerful song you see the simple
[33:31] songs with the with a with
[33:33] not these big long
[33:35] um
[33:37] explanations or and and those are good
[33:39] as well but
[33:40] you awesome god
[33:43] you awesome he is awesome and
[33:46] i just thought i saw i saw that here
[33:48] extremely impressive
[33:50] or daunting inspiring or
[33:54] as in this awesome power of atomic bomb
[33:57] so we're talking large scale here right
[34:00] sorry this is nothing to do with my
[34:01] sermon
[34:03] extremely well and excellently
[34:06] beautiful brother andy you can preach
[34:08] maybe one day on that and
[34:10] give us the proper termina uh
[34:11] terminology
[34:14] okay
[34:16] hess up
[34:18] his up small little plant
[34:21] and um
[34:22] [Music]
[34:24] and i'll show you
[34:27] that
[34:27] or from from from the previous ones you
[34:30] could see there's a zip on the right
[34:32] and um definitely not impressive
[34:35] definitely not huge definitely nothing
[34:37] to to look upon
[34:40] but
[34:42] it ties in with my idea and my and and
[34:45] what the lord's placed in me in terms of
[34:47] faith it all started actually
[34:49] with the word on the right hand side
[34:51] order now coming from a bit of a
[34:54] background of where we come from in the
[34:56] south africa very proud proud
[34:59] nation and and yes it's a rainbow nation
[35:01] but within that is very
[35:03] uh you have to be proud of where you are
[35:06] from and what you've achieved and all
[35:08] that kind of thing
[35:09] and with that where my sort of family
[35:11] tree and everything comes from from this
[35:14] not not my heavenly family tree praise
[35:16] the lord but this earth one oh maybe i
[35:19] can tell just tell you you probably see
[35:20] i've got glasses on last sunday i i tore
[35:24] one of the one of the contact lenses and
[35:26] that was my last order so if you haven't
[35:29] seen me with glasses this is how i look
[35:32] hey
[35:33] hopefully you won't see me too much for
[35:35] that
[35:36] hey
[35:37] should my beard brother keep it so it
[35:39] just looks more slim
[35:42] so um order order so yeah from a from a
[35:45] uh dutch germanic sort of background
[35:49] forefathers you know before 1650
[35:51] whatever um
[35:53] there was this was this this order and
[35:55] this regiment and this all and from that
[35:58] angle and from a denominational
[36:00] perspective i found
[36:02] i found
[36:05] i found order good go order in the
[36:08] church it needs to be office there needs
[36:10] to be this they need to be that and
[36:11] everything needs to be in order
[36:13] and
[36:15] to the extreme where
[36:17] sometimes in a
[36:18] certain church i won't mention names
[36:21] it'll be 25 minutes preaching it'll be
[36:23] five minutes talking about tires or
[36:25] offerings that will be um
[36:27] three songs two of them assams and
[36:31] and then three other hymns and then you
[36:33] will be on the hour you will be done and
[36:35] finished and out of there so
[36:37] the reason they had clocks in the church
[36:38] is to
[36:39] see that you don't go over that
[36:43] and now yeah i've come a long way
[36:46] the lord the lord the lord has broken a
[36:48] bit so um
[36:50] and i were talking to brother jeremy um
[36:53] that was briefly here for the funeral
[36:54] and he said that's one of the
[36:56] impressions that there was left with him
[36:58] with brother month our man sorry i'm
[37:00] throwing you under the bus
[37:01] but um this long
[37:03] why is the church why does it take so
[37:05] long and why do you know like i would
[37:07] spend the whole day now here man i was
[37:09] just the whole weekend so anniversary
[37:11] weekend coming up so prepare yourself
[37:14] we're going to have a jubilee
[37:15] throw away all your watches
[37:18] right
[37:20] faith and order hyssop so
[37:23] the idea of god is a god of order
[37:25] um
[37:26] he is he's not he's unchanging
[37:31] just think about the the um universe and
[37:34] what order there needs to be
[37:36] and if you just take in a scale where
[37:38] our little mother earth is is rotating
[37:42] what what will happen if it goes a bit
[37:45] off
[37:45] off sink you know or when when when when
[37:48] we get a bit too heavy or a bit lopsided
[37:51] or we spin too fast or twos too i mean
[37:53] and the scientists can all
[37:55] um sort of delve into that and then
[37:57] explain you in real detail what will
[37:59] happen
[38:01] but god has four in that god has
[38:04] made us
[38:07] in order
[38:08] and that's why we well that's why i can
[38:10] stand here physically that's why i can
[38:12] see the screen
[38:14] so from here i just want to sort of
[38:18] start to explain
[38:19] the idea and this is also again multiple
[38:22] times done
[38:24] can we can we can we try and step into
[38:28] um
[38:29] into the time
[38:30] where moses
[38:33] and and and and he called all the elders
[38:36] right so here comes all the
[38:38] all the
[38:39] elderly gentlemen i i assume
[38:42] and tell them
[38:44] this is this
[38:45] this is what the lords tell me told me
[38:47] you need to go out and do this tell your
[38:50] families tell do not do and and and
[38:53] giving this this order right
[38:56] and
[38:59] would you not think there was someone
[39:00] standing there
[39:02] maybe one of the kids or whatever
[39:04] and
[39:06] dad comes in and he says okay
[39:08] we need hyssop we need lamb we'll sort
[39:11] it all out you know like the in an idea
[39:13] house we would do a bit of delegating so
[39:15] you do this you do that and you so and
[39:18] you and you scatter you go okay you get
[39:20] the hyssop we'll grab a lamb on the way
[39:22] you sharpen the knife we get everything
[39:24] ready we've got to be ready before
[39:26] midnight right before so
[39:29] there goes one of the one of the
[39:31] children let's take children if it's for
[39:33] example and he runs off and he grabs the
[39:35] first
[39:36] bush that he can find get a bunch of it
[39:39] dad's going to be so impressed they
[39:41] that's going to be so impressive big
[39:43] bunch of big brushes and everything of
[39:45] of um
[39:47] i don't know what was the end her toy
[39:49] origami or something like that you know
[39:52] um
[39:52] lavender lavender was quite a popular
[39:55] thing so grabbing that oh it smells so
[39:57] beautiful looks so good dad's gonna be
[39:59] so impressed i'm getting this big bunch
[40:01] of that and put that there yes i've got
[40:03] time to spare they're not even back with
[40:04] the lamb yet so you know all good here
[40:07] comes dad
[40:08] see okay so
[40:10] i took a bit longer than usual and i
[40:12] come in and open the door and as a
[40:14] oh it's lavender why is it lavender
[40:17] why is lavender did did moses not say
[40:19] um what did he say hyssop it was hyssop
[40:22] yes um who brought her who brought the
[40:25] lavender why is the lavender we need to
[40:27] go we need to get hyssop we need to
[40:29] apply
[40:30] we apply the blood with hyssop
[40:32] okay a simple thing like that
[40:34] so do you not think that people israel
[40:38] the the the physical israel the jew
[40:41] was was running around and grabbing all
[40:44] the hyssop do you think there was any
[40:45] hyssop left
[40:47] it was hyssop that was in the order
[40:50] you do not apply anything else
[40:53] now i'll come to why i'm saying that and
[40:56] and and yes god is a god of order and
[40:59] from the smallest to the biggest thing
[41:01] he's placed in order and he's and has
[41:03] given us instruction
[41:05] so that we can follow
[41:10] just imagine
[41:12] while you there
[41:13] that
[41:15] where they came now this is one of the
[41:16] last plagues well this is the last
[41:18] plague sorry and
[41:20] when they get to this point jew
[41:23] gentile
[41:24] have seen destruction have seen thus
[41:27] saith the lord in action
[41:29] have seen all these um absolute
[41:32] tumultuous times with with you know
[41:34] crops being destroyed and and
[41:36] everything sort of taken away
[41:39] you would think
[41:41] that god means business
[41:43] he's he's not here to to play around
[41:46] he's not here to to to to be
[41:50] satisfied with just picking up a stick
[41:53] and applying some blood
[41:55] maybe just on the top lentil maybe just
[41:57] on the two posts and then forget about
[41:59] and walk in
[42:01] that that there was a structure there
[42:03] was an order there was a lord
[42:07] and the lord said do this
[42:09] there was no if but some babies right
[42:12] so we've seen
[42:13] that line that
[42:15] coming up from there and saying here's
[42:18] the
[42:18] now you apply the blood and this is how
[42:21] you apply the blood
[42:24] i'll jump quickly to
[42:28] one kings now this um he's talking here
[42:32] about about um solomon and
[42:35] oh man it's it's so wonderful that the
[42:38] some of the sermons i'm listening to
[42:40] the one in particular today um was
[42:43] talking about all about solomon
[42:45] and it was interesting because i only
[42:47] found this today and i thought i have to
[42:50] i have to throw it in
[42:51] and he spake of trees from the cedar
[42:53] tree that is in lebanon even unto the
[42:56] hyssop that springeth out of the wall he
[42:58] spake also of beasts and a fowl and of
[43:01] creeping things and of fishes
[43:04] so something as significant as the um
[43:08] as the cedar tree so so the cedar trees
[43:11] were were quite impressive
[43:13] impressive in those days and and and
[43:16] um
[43:17] i will quickly maybe jump to there the
[43:19] cedaw of liminen
[43:22] um the cedar of lemon and like a one and
[43:24] only tree now this is something i found
[43:26] just online that that sort of ties
[43:28] everything also from a scripture uh
[43:31] scripture a spiritual sense
[43:33] um one and only tree in scripture grows
[43:36] up so one and only in terms of a very
[43:38] unique one a one that's that's sort of
[43:40] standing um amongst the other trees out
[43:44] you know
[43:46] grows upright majestic and distinct and
[43:48] stature resilient and enduring as lumber
[43:51] for construction and temples and palaces
[43:54] these cedars flourished in a
[43:56] one-of-a-kind location the cooler
[43:58] mountain heights of lebanon
[44:00] to the north of the land promised to
[44:02] abraham's sea uh descendants
[44:05] so he's
[44:07] here he he he's referring to
[44:10] to to the cedar of lebanon something
[44:12] that is that is magnificent that is big
[44:14] it is 100 feet tall um
[44:17] you know and then in the same breath and
[44:20] in the same sentence referring to hyssop
[44:23] something insignificant something small
[44:25] something doesn't grow
[44:28] crow bigger than a meter you know
[44:31] it's a shrub it's not even a bush i was
[44:33] thinking you know maybe it was hessop
[44:35] that was the burning bush but then i
[44:36] thought
[44:37] bush is bigger than a shrub it's
[44:39] beginner you know a herb so um
[44:43] i thought okay no let's leave that i'm
[44:45] not gonna not gonna play around with
[44:47] what was it potentially and what was
[44:49] burning
[44:54] yes
[44:57] so
[44:59] now there was a set vessel full of
[45:01] vinegar
[45:02] and they filled the sponge with vinegar
[45:05] and put it upon hyssop and put it to his
[45:08] mouth
[45:12] the application
[45:14] of this hessep and where it was used
[45:17] to
[45:19] thinking now of the cedar of lebanon
[45:22] is here's the cedar for me
[45:24] here's the one tree here's the tree of
[45:26] life here's our tree v tree
[45:29] and hyssop is being applied or used to
[45:32] apply something
[45:34] something insignificant right it was
[45:36] most probably growing from amongst you
[45:40] know on golf
[45:42] how do you pronounce i say
[45:44] golfer
[45:48] um it was probably growing sort of
[45:50] everywhere in the crevices and in the
[45:52] walls so that's why i've put up these
[45:54] pictures of words growing in the in the
[45:57] crevices
[45:58] in the in the walls it's quite a it's
[46:01] quite a
[46:03] let me let me let me show you
[46:07] so from the the city of lebanon
[46:09] plummeting down to hyssop
[46:12] see the treetops soaring near you
[46:14] hundred feet tall
[46:16] descend to the humble herb
[46:18] spilled out across the hot arid common
[46:20] grounds of the holy land sprawling at a
[46:22] lowly 18 inches or so
[46:24] a herb from the mint family there's a
[46:27] lot of um
[46:28] a lot of research trying to being done
[46:30] and and controversy about about whether
[46:33] it was part of this mint was it part of
[46:35] the oregano was it part of um you know
[46:38] what hyssop family or family from the
[46:41] hyssop was used but i won't go into that
[46:43] i've got something here called is off so
[46:46] i'll go into that now
[46:48] a herb from the mint
[46:50] family hessop is a hardy plant that
[46:52] grows without complaint and the most
[46:54] challenging of circumstances
[46:56] intense all day sun with little water
[46:59] herbs have a forgiving culture growing
[47:01] back easily when branches have been
[47:03] broken or removed and no fussiness for
[47:06] fertilizer
[47:07] this modest plant is mentioned in
[47:09] self-depleting sinful and brushed with
[47:11] death moments across scripture it was
[47:14] waved over door frames for the angel of
[47:16] death to pass over
[47:18] israel households and used to cleanse
[47:20] those struck by skin diseases
[47:23] and it does go on
[47:26] so there's my cedar and there he's being
[47:29] applied he's he's he's receiving hyssop
[47:32] hyssop has touched his tongue has
[47:35] touched his lips
[47:37] right
[47:41] the application of faith
[47:43] this application now i want to tie this
[47:46] hessip to faith
[47:48] our
[47:49] beloved
[47:51] prophet speaks of a about hisp and tying
[47:54] it to faith now i want to bring in that
[47:56] picture of where we've
[47:58] we've had
[48:00] we've had uh exodus
[48:03] being applied that is that is yes the
[48:05] god is a god of order
[48:08] but if you take that hyssop and you
[48:10] apply that
[48:11] what are you left with you walking into
[48:14] your house and you sitting there and you
[48:17] probably hear the death angel coming
[48:19] over
[48:20] feeling it death is not a good thing
[48:22] death is not a a thing that is sat
[48:25] subtle
[48:26] and they are sitting in there and the
[48:29] only thing they have is what the lord
[48:31] said i applied this lord this is
[48:33] according to your word for now for this
[48:36] season and due season i've done what
[48:38] you've asked me through a prophet i've
[48:41] applied now i'm sitting and what am i
[48:43] doing
[48:44] am i
[48:46] am
[48:46] i am i in doubt
[48:51] so now faith comes
[48:53] now
[48:54] the believer comes out now he's saying
[48:57] there was probably people that were
[48:58] sitting and dancing and praising the
[49:00] lord for they've seen all these miracles
[49:04] they've received this word from the
[49:06] prophet they've done what they should do
[49:08] and now they're rejoicing because
[49:10] they've received that faith already but
[49:12] there's people inside there saying
[49:14] lord the only thing i have left now is
[49:16] faith the only thing i have now is faith
[49:19] is believing that what you've done for
[49:22] the descendants from the children
[49:25] when you've kicked them out of edom from
[49:27] there to now you've shown us time and
[49:30] time again where you come and you rescue
[49:33] us
[49:34] here please lord come and rescue us
[49:36] again the only thing that was sitting
[49:38] inside there
[49:39] was um was faith
[49:42] and what i wanted to throw in here is
[49:44] faith
[49:45] is
[49:46] faith is punctual
[49:49] faith is is never too late now i tie
[49:51] faith to the lord jesus christ right
[49:53] it's it's not it's not a separate thing
[49:55] that i'm saying here but it's punctual
[49:57] because it has a appointment yes
[50:00] faith's divine appointment is perfectly
[50:04] in season
[50:05] when it's met with action
[50:08] right now all of a sudden
[50:10] faith runs when it when it leaves your
[50:13] mouth you we i need to hear sorry about
[50:15] that i need to hear you
[50:18] i need the lord is saying speak
[50:21] let it happen
[50:22] let faith run
[50:25] let it leave the mouth and let it that
[50:27] it that it can
[50:29] find its divine appointment
[50:32] the woman touching the hymn of jesus's
[50:34] garment
[50:36] pushing through the crowd
[50:38] but faith has a divine appointment
[50:42] it was not made easy for her
[50:44] pushing through those crowds so if you
[50:45] can't imagine and praise the lord i've
[50:48] been having this wonderful time where i
[50:50] can place myself in a time in the
[50:53] scripture and i can see what's happening
[50:55] around me and all of a sudden i'm seeing
[50:57] this woman pushing through this crowd
[50:59] this was not 20 30 people
[51:02] we're talking about a crowd
[51:04] and she's pushing against this she's
[51:06] she's she's she faith has got a divine
[51:09] appointment i just need to get to that
[51:12] hem of that garment i just need to touch
[51:14] any part of him just to
[51:17] what then everything stops and i see it
[51:20] in myself as there was a stop there was
[51:23] a pause there was a silence and the
[51:24] crowd got
[51:26] quiet
[51:27] why is this man stopping what has
[51:29] happened what has changed what was
[51:31] different from a few steps ago to now he
[51:34] says virtue has left me who has touched
[51:36] me what do you mean who's touched you
[51:38] look around you you've got a crowd of
[51:40] people following you
[51:43] but one had a divine appointment
[51:51] i'll quickly give two testimonies and
[51:53] then we can move on to that wonderful
[51:55] piece in the scripture
[51:57] uh
[51:58] and um
[51:59] in one of the our messages
[52:01] and that's
[52:02] um a small thing so i want to i want to
[52:05] let you understand that faith is
[52:09] faith
[52:10] is not
[52:12] is not in any way
[52:14] connected to size
[52:16] now when i say that
[52:18] um
[52:19] we can pray for rain
[52:21] from one sense this is big from one
[52:23] sense this is small
[52:24] we can pray that i foun and and brother
[52:28] honestly said it lord i need a new car
[52:31] right something that could be
[52:32] insignificant to one is big and
[52:34] significant to the other
[52:36] so faith is not connected to
[52:40] what is being asked right
[52:44] lundy so we we had these little storms i
[52:47] think it was a week or two weeks ago
[52:49] we had the storms coming through
[52:52] jumped in the car and it's exactly at
[52:54] that time that everyone need to be
[52:55] dropped at school and all that and it's
[52:58] pouring down it's bucketing down and
[53:01] landing goes citizen cars and say oh
[53:03] lord just gives us that little gap just
[53:05] to drop the kids to run and to get out
[53:07] and just you know so that i i'm not
[53:09] soaking wet
[53:10] now if she was soaking wet
[53:13] nothing would have happened she would
[53:14] not have melted but she was saying just
[53:17] lord just give me that grace
[53:20] and i'm not saying
[53:22] it stopped and it was dry and the ground
[53:24] you know all of a sudden was you know
[53:26] where i was walking was dry
[53:28] but
[53:29] there was a significant change in
[53:31] difference in the climate so as soon as
[53:34] she left the car and i was driving
[53:36] around the block because now we're in a
[53:38] storm and i'm saying okay i'll circle
[53:40] the block twice when you come out you
[53:42] phone me we do this whole
[53:44] little routine and i'll fit you and you
[53:46] jump in the car so you don't get too
[53:47] much weight you know to wait
[53:50] and
[53:51] she strolled and she strolled out get in
[53:53] the car started pouring and rain again
[53:56] we go but lord i can't forget you in
[53:57] these moments
[53:59] i can't say that's not you lord
[54:02] oh my
[54:04] so that was there was that was really
[54:06] and that makes you happy you know you
[54:08] can sit and you can cry sometimes
[54:10] because because
[54:12] faith had that divine appointment but
[54:14] sometimes you just you feel sprightly
[54:16] and alive and you just wanna you know
[54:18] sort of leave this earth with joy
[54:21] uh because of small little moments like
[54:23] that but the lord can trust us then in
[54:26] the small moments he can trust us then
[54:28] in the big moments he will give that to
[54:29] us
[54:30] the big moment so
[54:32] the next example also quite recent in
[54:35] the last week
[54:36] my
[54:37] my sister previously contacted me with
[54:39] one of the kids that's either in their
[54:41] school or one of the family friends
[54:43] that's that's gone through a bit of a
[54:45] muscle
[54:46] um
[54:47] problem so some of the people that's
[54:49] here ck levels i i'm not too sure from a
[54:51] scientific level what that means but the
[54:53] ck levels in the body was very very very
[54:56] high and um the doctors were quite
[54:58] concerned about this this
[55:00] logan is his name
[55:02] and
[55:04] what happened is so now this is lead up
[55:06] so see the doctors there's a six weekly
[55:09] cycle and every four weeks they need to
[55:11] do this and this and that and um
[55:14] and the doctors were getting a bit more
[55:16] concerned so what happened is i i assume
[55:19] uh my sister then asked my dad can can
[55:21] we pray for her
[55:23] and um
[55:25] now and this this shows you that the
[55:27] lord
[55:28] you can you can tie this to the
[55:30] scripture to to this message tonight in
[55:32] terms of the god as a god of order it
[55:34] had to happen that my dad probably
[55:37] wasn't that comfortable with giving
[55:41] a prayer in english sorry dad if you're
[55:43] watching
[55:44] um
[55:45] so he asked me he said can i can i just
[55:48] make do a little prayer do a little
[55:50] prayer in english and i can send it to
[55:52] these and these uh you know english
[55:54] people so
[55:56] i said yeah sure and i started typing a
[55:57] message right at the end when i sent it
[56:00] i go oh i actually just could have left
[56:02] a voice note you know
[56:04] and i said what do you prefer do you
[56:05] want to send like a text do you want to
[56:07] he said no no no the voice note will be
[56:09] fine
[56:10] so next morning i sort of i had the
[56:12] prayer that i typed open and i thought
[56:14] okay
[56:15] i'll pray that but you know i'll just
[56:18] i'll just pray as i want to pray
[56:20] i sat and knelt at the bed
[56:22] and prayed and um
[56:24] and i and i and i sent the voice note
[56:27] so now you know um
[56:29] and actually i sent the miracle working
[56:31] god one of one of these recordings to
[56:34] them
[56:36] and um
[56:37] one of the church recordings so so um
[56:39] sent that and they were very happy
[56:41] lucinda my sister was very happy and
[56:43] very grateful and it was received and
[56:46] and the message came back from the
[56:47] parents saying they they were so happy
[56:50] they were so um filled with joy to to
[56:54] have people that they don't know from a
[56:56] borrow soap and that will they will
[56:58] enter in and pray and and and give this
[57:00] um sort of honor and glory to god
[57:03] and and
[57:05] asking where the faith has got a divine
[57:07] appointment
[57:09] so what happened is
[57:10] um uh
[57:12] the long and short is logan was meant to
[57:14] go
[57:15] for another checkup
[57:17] uh monday so monday south african time
[57:20] and um
[57:22] if the ck levels didn't drop enough then
[57:25] you know they would have had to do a
[57:28] muscular biopsy i think it's called so
[57:31] quite a significant thing i actually
[57:33] don't know how old logan is but from
[57:35] what i understand he's not that old and
[57:38] um
[57:40] and
[57:41] was it was it because i could climb into
[57:44] that burden and see but lord i see young
[57:46] healthy
[57:48] children of my own and i do not want any
[57:51] child to go through
[57:52] trauma and and and a limitation in the
[57:55] body to to be active and jump around and
[57:58] was it that or was it that divine
[58:01] appointment of
[58:02] that
[58:04] all of our faith the family's faith
[58:06] pulled together to to to bring testimony
[58:09] and what i've what i've recently also
[58:12] discovered um
[58:14] actually that was revealed to me is
[58:16] ask ask a reason
[58:18] why
[58:19] why somebody needs to be healed why
[58:22] somebody needs a car why somebody needs
[58:26] a restoration in their in their soul or
[58:29] coming back to the lord why
[58:31] is it
[58:32] i want to be healed lord
[58:35] so that i'm not sick anymore
[58:37] or is it can i go and give a testimony
[58:40] when you come on the scene and that the
[58:42] devoid appointment is met and it's
[58:45] completed can i go and praise your name
[58:47] and and
[58:49] and and ask that you come into my life
[58:52] because of this you know is the is there
[58:54] is a significant reason why you asking
[58:57] um
[58:59] for faith to run
[59:02] so logan came back or sorry the message
[59:05] uh message came back
[59:06] and maybe i could just quickly read that
[59:08] if you don't mind
[59:10] um
[59:12] this morning my heart overflows with
[59:14] thanks thankfulness so this was
[59:16] yesterday our time
[59:19] god is good all the time i see his
[59:20] miracle in my little logan and i don't
[59:22] know how to thank him enough we finally
[59:25] got logan's results
[59:26] now previously um the ck levels was i
[59:29] think between four and five thousand so
[59:32] i don't know what's the what's those
[59:34] levels logan's results and logan ck
[59:37] levels come back to 310
[59:40] over the next week or two it should be
[59:42] fully back to normal along with the
[59:44] enzymes that's a bit high in his liver
[59:47] all glory to god
[59:48] this has been such a difficult two weeks
[59:51] and she carries on
[59:53] now
[59:54] yeah i mean i'm not a guy for numbers or
[59:56] science or anything that just sounds
[59:58] that there was a significant change
[1:00:00] within a couple of feet within a couple
[1:00:01] of steps there was virtue left me who
[1:00:05] was touching the hem of the garment and
[1:00:07] i can sit on this side twelve thousand
[1:00:08] kilometers away and say who touched that
[1:00:10] hem of that garment
[1:00:12] amen lord's everywhere and you know what
[1:00:14] the squeeze that's coming from the left
[1:00:16] and right onto us and we're squeezing
[1:00:18] upwards that means we can look over all
[1:00:21] these little walls of denomination and
[1:00:23] all these little things that's been
[1:00:24] erect and we can say we will pray for
[1:00:26] you regardless we will love you
[1:00:29] regardless and we will cross all these
[1:00:31] boundaries
[1:00:32] into that
[1:00:34] heavenly vision and that
[1:00:35] liberty that we will have
[1:00:37] of praying
[1:00:40] in faith
[1:00:43] the token
[1:00:44] oh i think it's a great lesson for us
[1:00:47] now this has also come
[1:00:49] it was good timing because i was
[1:00:51] preparing this and that was one of the
[1:00:53] first thing i i threw into my into my
[1:00:56] notes and then i think it was sister
[1:00:57] vanessa or someone that shared it with
[1:01:00] you know with lundy or something like
[1:01:01] that i thought yeah no i was i was
[1:01:03] literally still on the page when all
[1:01:06] this this this happened so i thought
[1:01:07] well thank you lord
[1:01:09] seeing the believing worship as he was
[1:01:12] identified by the token of blood
[1:01:14] he had to the believer had to get the
[1:01:16] lamb slay the lamb a lamb for a house
[1:01:18] take the lamb at the blood the hyssop
[1:01:21] which was just a little brush that grows
[1:01:23] up there in the country
[1:01:24] common weeds we call it and how to apply
[1:01:26] the blood it shows by the applying of
[1:01:28] the blood with his hyssop hyssop
[1:01:30] represents faith many times people think
[1:01:33] they have to have some supernatural
[1:01:35] faith to be a believer it isn't
[1:01:38] the fight the hessop speaks for that
[1:01:40] just common with like you could get it
[1:01:43] anywhere pick it up dip it in the blood
[1:01:45] and apply the blood i just want to
[1:01:47] quickly go back and show you that's
[1:01:49] hyssop
[1:01:51] it's it's not big it is not significant
[1:01:55] but it is in order
[1:01:57] and it represents for us it represents
[1:02:00] faith
[1:02:02] um
[1:02:03] the blood tonight is applied by simple
[1:02:05] faith just not nothing supernatural is
[1:02:08] just around you everywhere
[1:02:10] just simply like a child reach out and
[1:02:12] get a hold of it and apply the blood the
[1:02:15] hyssop is just a simple childlike
[1:02:16] faithful to believe it isn't something
[1:02:18] out of your reach
[1:02:20] not out of your reach as a ten
[1:02:23] eight five year old not out of your
[1:02:25] reach as a 65 year old a hyssop
[1:02:28] you don't have to reach very far to get
[1:02:31] at this heist that grows in this in that
[1:02:33] country it grows out of the cracks of
[1:02:35] the walls
[1:02:37] out of the cleft of the rock
[1:02:39] was my thoughts that i thought there
[1:02:41] kind of a diamond shaped leaf you can
[1:02:42] pick it up anywhere just as grass or
[1:02:44] weeds would be and in the country here
[1:02:46] now just pick it up and apply it
[1:02:49] that's the way
[1:02:51] faith is to be applied take faith rather
[1:02:55] and apply the blood of jesus christ by
[1:02:57] faith to the heart's door this was going
[1:02:59] to separate and make the difference
[1:03:01] between those who were going out of
[1:03:03] egypt and those who were going to stay
[1:03:05] in egypt and perish with egypt it made
[1:03:08] the difference strange how god you
[1:03:11] always works through science signals
[1:03:13] tokens and so forth and i would say
[1:03:15] order as well he always has done it
[1:03:18] because he hasn't changed that's his way
[1:03:20] of doing anything he never does it
[1:03:22] outside of that god never makes a move
[1:03:24] until he does it that way
[1:03:26] the way the the the way god starts
[1:03:29] that's the way god finishes he's
[1:03:31] infinite in ineptant omnipresent
[1:03:34] omniscient he needs nobody's help he
[1:03:37] doesn't need our interpretation praise
[1:03:39] the lord for that praise the lord for
[1:03:42] that and i just want to and i just want
[1:03:45] to quickly
[1:03:47] change the little angle from where what
[1:03:50] we read here from faith
[1:03:52] and that little hyssop that's
[1:03:53] insignificant
[1:03:55] that's something that's got so much
[1:03:57] power
[1:03:58] when it's when it's in order when it's
[1:04:00] stepped into that position when it's it
[1:04:03] it
[1:04:04] it's it's it's it's where it needs to be
[1:04:07] it's waiting for the divine appointment
[1:04:10] changing the dynamics slightly to look
[1:04:12] at the individual
[1:04:14] and i want to talk to you
[1:04:16] what do you think what about you
[1:04:18] you if you think
[1:04:20] that you are insignificant in the
[1:04:23] greater economy of god well praise the
[1:04:25] lord because watch out because that will
[1:04:28] be halfway down the road for you
[1:04:31] to becoming part of god's order god's
[1:04:35] economy if you think you're
[1:04:36] insignificant well you've got something
[1:04:38] coming
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:44] i want to yeah i want to leave you with
[1:04:47] something that
[1:04:50] faith
[1:04:51] hyssop
[1:04:52] and love love how love ties how
[1:04:56] how can you not love
[1:04:58] um the lord of
[1:05:00] uh of of isaac and jacob and abraham
[1:05:03] lord
[1:05:04] if
[1:05:05] you've seen all these things happen
[1:05:07] how can you not love him
[1:05:09] and
[1:05:10] something that struck me
[1:05:12] very recent it is not a new song
[1:05:14] in any
[1:05:16] matter
[1:05:19] but this is
[1:05:20] this is the bridge of the song and i'll
[1:05:22] read it for you
[1:05:23] this is a a divine appointment from
[1:05:27] almighty god with you
[1:05:30] this is what i saw here there's no
[1:05:33] shadow
[1:05:34] you won't light up
[1:05:35] there's no mountain you won't climb up
[1:05:38] coming after me there's no wall you
[1:05:40] can't kick down
[1:05:42] lie you won't tear down coming after me
[1:05:45] there's no shadow you won't light up and
[1:05:48] mountain you won't climb it and start
[1:05:50] singing there's no wall you won't kick
[1:05:53] down and lie you won't tear down as the
[1:05:56] musicians come
[1:05:59] there's no wall
[1:06:01] you want he
[1:06:03] he you lord
[1:06:05] won't kick down
[1:06:07] and lie down
[1:06:08] coming after me
[1:06:10] that is a divine appointment that the
[1:06:12] lord's got with each one of you
[1:06:14] if you have that little small
[1:06:17] insignificant
[1:06:20] faith
[1:06:22] and that faith leaves your mouth
[1:06:24] and that faith's got a divine
[1:06:26] appointment
[1:06:28] you better watch out
[1:06:30] something will change
[1:06:32] we cannot
[1:06:34] it cannot not happen
[1:06:37] in the greater economy of god
[1:06:40] thank you lord for this can we close our
[1:06:42] eyes
[1:06:44] lord jesus
[1:06:48] what a wonderful victorious time
[1:06:51] that we live in
[1:06:53] lord
[1:06:54] what a time that
[1:06:57] that you've come
[1:06:58] and and and come behind this little
[1:07:00] message lord and say but i will take you
[1:07:03] through this
[1:07:04] to to to show you what to say
[1:07:07] lord i
[1:07:08] you you would bring something on my on
[1:07:10] my heart lord but then you would test my
[1:07:13] faith
[1:07:14] lord and
[1:07:16] i pray i and i'm grateful lord
[1:07:19] that i could say that i could that i

[1:07:27] met them i don't care whether they
[1:07:31] i care for their soul yes lord
[1:07:34] but i don't care where they're sitting
[1:07:36] with you at that point if they
[1:07:38] acknowledge that you are the true
[1:07:40] creator and that's what i said in my
[1:07:42] message as well
[1:07:44] i said if you can get logan to believe
[1:07:48] if you
[1:07:49] my sister if you can get
[1:07:51] the parents to believe
[1:07:53] something will change
[1:07:56] and they started believing and i believe
