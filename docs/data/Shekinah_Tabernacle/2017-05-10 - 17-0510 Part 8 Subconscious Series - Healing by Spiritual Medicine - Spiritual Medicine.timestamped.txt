[3:23] [Music]
[3:40] you
[3:43] [Music]
[3:51] brother Chris is here so we can start I
[3:57] was good to see you all here tonight
[4:01] thank you for making the effort to come
[4:03] out and set aside a night of our week to
[4:10] gather together end be in the presence
[4:12] of God and to be enriched and to further
[4:20] [Music]
[4:22] learn our way through the unseen you
[4:26] know as Christians we sometimes think oh
[4:27] you know we just sometimes it feels like
[4:29] we just go to church and home and we
[4:30] maybe there might not be a lot happening
[4:32] but every week we're learning about the
[4:36] unseen we're learning about the unseen
[4:38] realm where people think there's nothing
[4:40] in that but maybe we and everything's
[4:43] going to right it doesn't matter but
[4:45] when things don't go right when you know
[4:48] your way through the unseen that's such
[4:50] a blessing when you get when you hit
[4:52] hardship and these unseen things start
[4:55] to affect you and it just thoughts come
[4:56] and everything comes we if you know your
[4:58] way through it you can coast through it
[5:00] easily that's why people have midlife
[5:02] crisis and the drastic thing will happen
[5:05] and they their life falls apart because
[5:07] they they haven't dealt with the unseen
[5:10] they've only dealt with the seen and
[5:11] what they do and everything and when
[5:12] these when these thoughts come and they
[5:14] hit these times they don't know how to
[5:15] make their way through it but as
[5:17] Christians we came here and we learn
[5:19] about the unseen and learn how to
[5:20] navigate through it and it's faith you
[5:22] know you can't see but you believe and
[5:23] you just know by faith this is the
[5:25] direction I'd hidden by faith this is
[5:27] the way I go and as you trust in the
[5:30] Lord more and more it becomes easier and
[5:32] easier just to have faith and say Lord
[5:33] this it doesn't matter what it looks
[5:35] like this is the way it will be the Word
[5:37] of God saves us this is the way it will
[5:39] be and it's so I pray oh I think we'll
[5:43] be in for another blessing tonight amen
[5:45] brother Andy said to me on Monday he
[5:51] said I'm going under the pillar of fire
[5:52] tonight
[5:53] what what are you talking about so
[5:56] that's what he calls it when he goes and
[5:57] studies and under the anointing and gets
[6:00] his thought so he said that's what I
[6:02] call it let's um let's open up we will
[6:06] stand up will open a prayer Lord Jesus
[6:10] we thank you that we can be here again
[6:11] this evening and to learn more about you
[6:15] bought into as as Paul said a little way
[6:19] we look not to the things that are seen
[6:20] but the things that are unseen for the
[6:22] things that are seen the temporal but
[6:23] the things that are unseen are eternal
[6:24] Lord and we want to look at the unseen
[6:26] things this evening Lord and may our
[6:28] minds switch on to that and may we
[6:30] receive all that you have for us Lord
[6:32] may we look through spiritual eyes and
[6:35] just receive all that you have may we
[6:37] just put off all the natural things with
[6:39] this life just for a while and sit at
[6:42] your feet Lord and learn from you this
[6:43] evening we just come at the service to
[6:45] your hands lord I pray please brother

[27:16] tonight we're going to speak on healing
[27:19] by spiritual medicine amen hallelujah
[27:22] he's so glad for spiritual medicine I'm
[27:25] so thankful and so happy that we have
[27:27] spiritual medicine amen hallelujah amen
[27:31] hallelujah so we'll just carry on now
[27:33] and so we're just read here in Ephesians
[27:35] 4 21 to 23 I think we've pretty well
[27:39] familiar with this we could probably
[27:40] turn that off and read it by memory but
[27:44] that's alright that's good actually if
[27:45] so be that you have heard him hallelujah
[27:48] amen I've heard him and I hear him and I
[27:51] speak with him and I have a conversation
[27:53] with him and I I constantly hear from
[27:57] the Lord amen and I hear him through
[28:00] ministry I hear him personally I hear
[28:02] him through song he speaks his voice is
[28:06] heard and the all the earth
[28:08] his voice is being spoken now but as
[28:10] what we do with that voice and what we
[28:12] do with what we hear how we act upon it
[28:15] and have been taught by him as the truth
[28:17] is in Jesus and the truth shall make you
[28:20] free
[28:20] Amen that you put off you put off don't
[28:25] wait for some miraculous revelation all
[28:28] the time God can give those things but
[28:30] he doesn't have to all the time and he
[28:31] won't all the time he wants you to put
[28:34] it off he wants to show you what's wrong
[28:36] and then you do you you act upon it and
[28:39] then you'll get the understanding and
[28:41] revelation about what you were actually
[28:43] imprisoned by you know and it's because
[28:46] God does things sometimes by miracle and
[28:48] sometimes he heals by medicine so that
[28:51] you put off concerning the former
[28:52] conversation the manner of life the way
[28:56] it used to be the old culture the old
[28:58] things that you did and your fathers did
[29:01] and whatever outside of Christ put it
[29:03] off that old man that ol nature the old
[29:07] things is going to kill you which is
[29:10] corrupt according to the deceitful lusts
[29:12] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[29:15] mind
[29:16] amen hallelujah may the Lord had his
[29:18] blessing to the reading of his word you
[29:20] may be seated
[29:21] god bless you it's good to be here amen
[29:24] hallelujah life and death are in the
[29:27] power of the tongue and they that rule
[29:29] it shall eat the fruits thereof proverbs
[29:32] 18:21 now that's a very striking
[29:35] Scripture life and death you know we eat
[29:40] life and death are in the power of the
[29:42] tongue there's a that puts a lot of
[29:45] weight on this little piece of muscle
[29:49] you know and it's not really the muscle
[29:52] in the movements and all of that and
[29:53] learning how to talk it's the concept
[29:55] that's the power of the what you're
[29:58] speaking and that power there's
[30:01] different levels of that power the first
[30:04] level is the power if you speak the word
[30:07] that's got God's Spirit in it now we're
[30:09] Network it spoken by the anointing and
[30:12] in season and under an inspiration and
[30:15] even if you just speak that word in
[30:18] faith to yourself or to others
[30:21] however there is a power contained in
[30:24] that word he said my words are spirit
[30:26] and they are life so there is power and
[30:29] network but then there's also another
[30:31] type of power in the tongue and that is
[30:33] when you
[30:34] speak positively and you are constantly
[30:36] talking good about people and just
[30:38] speaking positively there's a power on a
[30:41] natural level as well that's going to
[30:43] help you it's going to help your
[30:45] subconscious it's going to help your
[30:47] spirit it's going to help your memories
[30:48] and your affections and all those things
[30:50] are going to get washed by a positive
[30:51] speech by uncorrupt communication coming
[30:55] out of your mouth you know and and so
[30:58] that's why there is life and the power
[31:00] of the tongue but there's also death and
[31:03] that can cause a lot of trouble when you
[31:07] start to take things and start speaking
[31:09] things over this tongue that aren't good
[31:12] that are negative that aren't the will
[31:15] of God you know and you start taking
[31:17] things and mixing them together and and
[31:20] and using your tongue as a weapon for
[31:25] the for the enemy well and so this
[31:28] tongue what drives the tongue is a
[31:30] spirit yeah what's behind that tongue
[31:33] what's behind what that tongue saying
[31:35] what's the mode of an objective of what
[31:37] that tongue is saying and so you take it
[31:40] right back now we're not going to this
[31:42] whole session is not going to be about
[31:44] the tongue but I just wanted to show you
[31:46] that there is a lot of power in this
[31:49] little helm of this tongue that directs
[31:52] you know you've got this giant big
[31:53] Titanic ship huge big ships and they get
[31:59] turned by these little parts you know I
[32:01] don't know how big they are but they're
[32:03] not that they're not really in
[32:04] relativity to the size of the ship
[32:06] they're very small I don't know very
[32:09] small a meter maybe what size is the
[32:13] rudder on an inter islander Wow and they
[32:21] that rule it shall eat the fruits
[32:23] thereof aren't you so glad that you know
[32:24] when you can get the mastery when you
[32:26] can get when you can start to utilize
[32:28] your dominion over your spirit amen
[32:31] when your spirit stops controlling you
[32:34] and you can start controlling your
[32:36] spirit because you've been given that
[32:37] dominion and you can start you can
[32:39] recognize your position and the Lord can
[32:42] start healing you and doing things in
[32:43] your life so that you can actually get
[32:46] rulership over this time
[32:47] because it's possible now it's not by
[32:51] your own strength either man it's
[32:53] actually by the Holy Spirit
[32:55] without the Holy Spirit you will never
[32:57] get control of that tongue that tongue
[32:59] will just destroy your life and they
[33:02] that rule it shall eat the fruits
[33:03] thereof amen what are the fruits
[33:05] love joy peace longsuffering goodness
[33:08] temperance meekness and the fruits of
[33:11] the spirit this fruits in there is other
[33:14] fruits you know there's fruits of
[33:15] bringing forth children to the Lord
[33:18] speaking words of in season I think in
[33:21] some know Isaiah 50 it says that you've
[33:24] given me the tongue of the Loon that I
[33:26] may know how to speak a word that is in
[33:27] season to him that is weary amen and so
[33:32] there is a lot of power that's invested
[33:34] in this tongue and life and death so the
[33:37] one extreme to the other the very whole
[33:40] reason we're here is to choose between
[33:43] life and death and it hinges on this
[33:46] little helm that's going to steer your
[33:48] ship in a certain direction and life
[33:49] it's going to steer your ship now you've
[33:52] got to discern now what spirit is
[33:54] driving this tongue amen hallelujah I'm
[34:00] not going to go too far into this
[34:01] because I want to talk about it later
[34:03] because it's such an amazing verse
[34:05] Philemon 1:6 and it says that the
[34:09] communication of thy faith may become
[34:12] effectual now when something says the
[34:16] communication of your faith may become
[34:18] effectual now that's going to turn faith
[34:21] into something that's virtuous something
[34:23] that's got power something that's going
[34:25] to happen it's going to be effectual
[34:27] it's going to have an effect so you know
[34:29] you're it's because you've all been
[34:31] given faith right and I said I wasn't
[34:33] going to go into it now but I just can't
[34:34] help it but you've been given faith
[34:37] everyone a measure of faith now you
[34:41] don't want to keep that just buried down
[34:43] and like you know under under restraint
[34:47] by all the enemies that it's been placed
[34:50] on site because you know like Israel got
[34:52] placed in a promised land there's like
[34:54] faith right it got placed in the in the
[34:56] land and right around everyone the whole
[34:58] thing came Confederate against them
[35:01] everyone was against them and they'd
[35:02] been built up for 400 years to resist
[35:04] them and everything was against them and
[35:07] against all odds they took it because
[35:08] God was with him but you see now that
[35:14] faith can be just dormant
[35:19] and it's sit there and do nothing
[35:20] because it's can being shrouded by fears
[35:23] complexes demons all sorts of things
[35:26] that can enshroud their faith and stop
[35:28] it from doing anything complexes in and
[35:31] and end bruises and scars and actual
[35:35] real ruptures and people's spirits that
[35:39] will keep that faith from becoming
[35:40] effectual and now the powerful part of
[35:44] this and it's so simple and so
[35:46] elementary and so practical and so easy
[35:49] and yet it's not easy because it becomes
[35:51] it's not just a quick fix it's a it's a
[35:54] lifestyle change it's a lifestyle that
[35:57] reflects the word and it's not legalism
[36:00] it's actually it's realism it this has
[36:04] to happen it has to happen and it will
[36:07] happen by the grace of God he will help
[36:09] you he'll help me I need help when I
[36:12] read these things that I don't I haven't
[36:13] got it all I don't know how to do all of
[36:16] the stuff and I don't practice it
[36:17] completely perfectly all the time but I
[36:19] I need the grace of God I need the Lord
[36:23] to help me live this life
[36:25] I need his grace I depend on him amen
[36:28] yeah Alleluia so the acknowledging now
[36:31] here it is your faith is going to become
[36:33] effectual by the acknowledging of every
[36:35] good thing which is in you you've got to
[36:38] acknowledge it you've got to recognize
[36:39] it recognize who you are recognized
[36:42] what's within you recognize what Jesus
[36:45] has invested in you in Christ Jesus of
[36:48] course not in you and your flesh but in
[36:51] you in Christ Jesus what Jesus has laid
[36:54] in the soil of your life amen and I've
[36:58] said it a few times you know like there
[36:59] you want to dig down some times and find
[37:02] out you know there's that you know in
[37:04] your hearts like in the soil in its
[37:06] fertile soil in and he's placed a lot of
[37:08] seed in there and there's a lot of
[37:10] harvest to get to come forth and
[37:13] something you know when you hear the
[37:14] word
[37:15] here preaching and then you get a
[37:16] revelation it's like you know the
[37:17] ministry just comes in here and they dig
[37:19] out a gym and they polish it up and they
[37:22] were and und in you realize wow it was
[37:24] already in me I already had this amen
[37:28] now brother Branham says this because
[37:36] you'll see now how much your physical
[37:40] body and and your thoughts and what they
[37:42] can do to stop you from actually
[37:45] perceiving reality by negative mindsets
[37:48] and where those negative Minds it's how
[37:50] the devil can come in and possess your
[37:52] life through those negative mindsets and
[37:55] blind you to reality blind you
[37:59] completely to reality and you can reject
[38:01] everything by just having negative mind
[38:05] a negative physical mind and so he says
[38:09] here brother as it was in that case so
[38:12] as the many a hypo needle stops the
[38:15] deathbed confection confession
[38:17] oh she thought she was right but when it
[38:20] came the time to die even a backslidden
[38:22] pastor had got around she was all right
[38:25] she sure she was a good member of the
[38:28] church and she paid into the church and
[38:31] she was a pianist in the church and what
[38:33] more what more could she do
[38:37] intellectually she was thinking she was
[38:40] right but when it came to a place you
[38:46] remember your mind is it's governed by
[38:49] the blood cells by the brain cells
[38:52] remember neuroplasticity and that's a
[38:56] big word for us you know but the mind
[39:00] and what you think all the time and what
[39:02] you practice and what becomes your
[39:03] manner of life it actually forges
[39:06] physical or electrical neuro patterns in
[39:09] your brain and news and it becomes easy
[39:12] to do that all the time and it's a
[39:13] default setting and your mind and your
[39:16] brain physically speaking now now here
[39:18] he says here that your mind is governed
[39:22] by these things it's governed by these
[39:24] brain cells and so that becomes a big
[39:27] problem if it's
[39:29] who's now here's this lady and she's
[39:31] been in church and she's doing all these
[39:33] religious practices and she wants to be
[39:35] right and she's been told lies by her
[39:38] pastor because they let them go because
[39:40] they just put money in the offering
[39:41] plate and whatever they do huh but
[39:45] anyway she was completely blind because
[39:46] real ministers that she came from and
[39:48] all of that that would come to her and
[39:50] tell her the truth she would refuse it
[39:53] but as we're going to read and then when
[39:57] them blood cease when them blood cease
[40:00] to function to those brain cells and
[40:02] then the mind begin to the intellectual
[40:04] part begin to die out of the woman and
[40:06] when it began to die out and she begin
[40:09] to see see that that mind that have been
[40:13] twisted into a certain way all the time
[40:16] when that started to fade away
[40:18] yeah the reality started coming now you
[40:22] know we really we pray that this reality
[40:25] comes to us before we get to that stage
[40:27] Amen Alleluia because you know that's
[40:30] the grace of God only the grace of God
[40:32] can show us that we can begin to see
[40:35] before our physical brain has to die but
[40:37] yet you see you've got to choose for
[40:39] that physical brain to die you've got to
[40:41] choose for all those mindsets and all
[40:42] those things that you used to enjoy and
[40:44] all the things that you used to love and
[40:45] those things that you got entertainment
[40:47] from is so used to a passive
[40:49] entertainment lifestyle that you don't
[40:50] even have to sit down and energy do
[40:52] anything you know and that really has to
[40:56] die now you've got to take a choice now
[40:59] over your you you the soul you've been
[41:03] given a choice now you can choose now
[41:06] I'm gonna I want to die to those things
[41:09] I don't want them anymore
[41:11] they don't need to be in my life then
[41:14] you'll begin to see really see waking up
[41:18] out of sleep when that this spirit down
[41:22] here in her heart which is her soul went
[41:24] toward God death means separate and if
[41:28] you sin just believe wilfully after the
[41:30] Gospels been presented to you that soul
[41:33] nature of yours will gradually move away
[41:35] from you and you'll feel it no more just
[41:39] wrought away you won't not that we just
[41:41] want to carry on
[41:42] you say well I know I believe I'm right
[41:44] that's what's the matter with Michigan
[41:46] tonight that's what's the with the
[41:49] matter with Indiana tonight that's
[41:50] what's the matter with the world tonight
[41:52] they have been smothered to sleep by
[41:54] petit Hollywood impersonation of
[41:57] Christianity what we need today is the
[42:00] old-fashioned Hellfire brimstone
[42:02] preachers back in the pulpit again to
[42:04] preach the truth write a Hell for
[42:06] sinners and accept the man be born again
[42:08] he will have no eyes into the kingdom
[42:10] now this whole fort of hell fire
[42:13] brimstone preachers some guy that's
[42:14] angry and just rough that's not what
[42:16] he's talking about he's talking about a
[42:18] man of conviction that preaches the
[42:20] truth and then the truth is the truth
[42:21] and and it's not in hate or is not an
[42:24] anger it's not just this whole one
[42:26] minded thing you're going to go to hell
[42:28] and repeat no it's the truth it's but
[42:30] it's actually pinpointing things so that
[42:33] you can make a real decision we're so
[42:35] privileged to what we're here we are the
[42:37] most privileged people on the earth that
[42:39] we can sit under ministry and we can sit
[42:41] under this message that has it's got a
[42:43] hell for sinners and accept the man be
[42:45] born again he shall in no wise into the
[42:48] kingdom not all you might go the Swale
[42:50] that way no you must be born again it
[42:52] must happen amen and really the truth
[42:56] shall make you free
[42:57] the truth amen amen shall make you free
[43:04] I miss something me on on a minute
[43:20] praise go on a raid here now we see that
[43:26] we see that influence and we can see
[43:29] that thoughts now and we've studied it
[43:31] over the last many parts that thoughts
[43:33] change your brain cells they change the
[43:37] makeup of you they change what the way
[43:40] you are by your thinking your thoughts
[43:43] have a lot of power and a lot of push
[43:45] inside your complex ecosystem inside you
[43:50] that makes up you all right and so here
[43:54] we're going to just hit a bit of medical
[43:55] side now and I'm going to show you and
[43:57] just this just let this make you
[44:00] recognize the the privilege you have
[44:03] that you know this stuff is only new
[44:06] discovery
[44:06] it says here now this is new discovery
[44:10] in science but we've been we've actually
[44:12] been exposed to this for a long time see
[44:15] the Bible has been teaching these things
[44:16] for 2,000 you actually longer all the
[44:18] way back from the Garden of Eden the
[44:20] Lord's been teaching these things and
[44:22] these principles have been laid out in
[44:24] the scriptures all the way and all the
[44:26] time and God's shown in all the lives of
[44:28] the Old Testament and then he brought it
[44:29] out in the message of the hour through
[44:31] the Prophet now just giving instruction
[44:33] of these things and now these guys are
[44:34] now coming to see it and we're very
[44:39] privileged to know that these things are
[44:41] very they're very normal for us gene
[44:46] activity can change according to
[44:48] perception according to doctor Bruce
[44:50] Lipton gene activity can change on a
[44:52] daily basis if the perception in your
[44:55] mind is reflected in the chemistry of
[44:58] your body and if your nervous system
[45:02] reads and interprets the environment and
[45:04] then controls the Bloods chemistry so
[45:09] what you perceive that's happening
[45:11] around you what you think now if you've
[45:14] got a clean mind and God healed you and
[45:16] you're not full of complexes or demon
[45:18] powers and things you're going to
[45:20] perceive things the way they really are
[45:21] you're going to catch what's really
[45:23] happening and discern it by the word but
[45:26] you see now there's in digest your
[45:28] perception after your perceptions
[45:30] negative and it's based on all these
[45:31] complexes and things that's happened
[45:33] and it's all about other people and
[45:35] blame and all those things your
[45:38] perception and most of 60% of humans was
[45:42] like there may be more outside of
[45:44] Christianity probably almost everybody
[45:46] you know there's very few people that
[45:48] aren't so complicated and they can't you
[45:50] can't actually you know they just push
[45:52] things around it says here that but then
[45:57] now your perception of that's going to
[45:58] control the physical makeup of your body
[46:01] so it's how you interpret the
[46:03] environment and then controls the blood
[46:05] chemistry then you can literally change
[46:08] the fate of your cells by altering your
[46:10] thoughts in fact up the Lipton's
[46:13] research illustrates now before this
[46:15] whole article I was reading the research
[46:19] was above so all of the things that they
[46:21] had gone through in the experiments but
[46:23] I didn't want to bring that out because
[46:25] you know we know we already know that
[46:27] this stuff is actually true but it's
[46:29] actually a really good synopsis of what
[46:31] I'm going through into so I thought I'd
[46:34] read it and it also makes you appreciate
[46:35] the Bible and appreciate the message of
[46:37] the hour that's already preaching these
[46:39] things without an actual education what
[46:41] see brother Branham had a divine
[46:43] education amen hallelujah we've got a
[46:45] divine education amen hallelujah I'm so
[46:48] glad for that in fact up the Lipton's
[46:50] research illustrates that by changing
[46:52] your perception your mind can alter the
[46:55] activity of your genes and create over
[46:58] 30,000 variations of product from each
[47:00] gene I don't know what that means to be
[47:03] honest but P but i but you can see what
[47:05] I'm talking about here there is of your
[47:07] mind and your thoughts whether they're
[47:09] positive or negative what's coming out
[47:11] of your tongue and what's motivating
[47:12] your tongue has got a very big influence
[47:14] on your physical well-being on the
[47:16] balance of your body on your mood swings
[47:18] and on your on your perception of
[47:21] reality amen
[47:22] what you're thinking so you can see now
[47:25] when you can start thinking on the word
[47:27] and I'm going to give you some tools
[47:28] later on in the service on how to
[47:32] overcome specific things and now I don't
[47:36] say that I'm going to cover everything
[47:38] but we'll just cover a few things to
[47:40] show you and then you'll get the drift
[47:42] and then I pray that you put it into
[47:44] practice
[47:45] I pray that you diagnose and put it into
[47:47] practice and actually start doing it
[47:49] because these things sometimes God will
[47:52] heal by miracle and then sometimes God
[47:55] will miraculously healed by medicine
[47:57] he'll take you through things and he'll
[48:00] teach you stuff and he'll want you to
[48:01] express your Dominion because he's
[48:03] teaching you how to rule and reign he's
[48:05] going to teach you how to become a good
[48:07] leader and he will start your leadership
[48:09] role in your own life how you're going
[48:11] to lead your spirit how you're going to
[48:13] lead your flesh and leave it and leader
[48:16] a part of you that is revolting all the
[48:19] time
[48:20] that doesn't really want to be led
[48:21] properly but when it can actually come
[48:23] into a balance it becomes happily
[48:25] dormant because it doesn't want it's not
[48:29] upset you know but when your flesh is
[48:31] all upset and it's not happily dormant
[48:34] it's going to it's going to overcome you
[48:36] and it's going to overwhelm you and all
[48:37] those emotions and all those things are
[48:39] going to rise up and it's going to
[48:40] become too much but if now these
[48:44] thoughts now that can change genetics
[48:47] contain within the nucleus of the cell
[48:49] and you can rewrite those genetic
[48:52] programs through changing your blood
[48:55] chemistry what changes your blood
[48:56] chemistry your thoughts your thinking
[48:59] now these guys have done experiments to
[49:01] find to actually see this happen in the
[49:04] simplest terms and I like that when I
[49:06] read that I was like I'm good I can
[49:08] understand something there this means
[49:10] that we need to change the way we think
[49:12] if we are to heal cancer now remember
[49:15] these guys don't understand about divine
[49:17] healing it's not us that heals it it's
[49:19] actually God on us there's the God's
[49:21] life in us right and our faith in the
[49:24] word but these people in doctors and
[49:27] medical have seen people that have
[49:30] positive thinking get over all sorts so
[49:36] you see but they don't understand that
[49:38] God made their body God breathe that
[49:40] breath of life into them even as corrupt
[49:42] as it is and how much it's been soiled
[49:45] by the human race and Satan and all that
[49:47] it still has the power in it to do
[49:50] things to accomplish stuff so how much
[49:53] more the Holy Ghost how much more a life
[49:55] that's coming to you can actually when
[49:57] you start thinking on those four
[49:59] the wavelength of those thoughts goes
[50:01] skyrocket us through the roof and what
[50:03] these guys even delving into skyrocket
[50:06] those thoughts there's power in the form
[50:08] of God and you let that thought come
[50:10] into your mind and you think on that you
[50:12] start speaking that you start confessing
[50:14] that you start singing that whatever it
[50:16] may be God puts it on your heart but you
[50:18] see the change amen says the function of
[50:24] the mind is to create coherence between
[50:27] our beliefs and the reality we
[50:29] experience dr. Lipton says what that
[50:33] means is that your mind will adjust the
[50:37] body's biology and behavior to fit with
[50:43] your beliefs my if you've been told
[50:47] you'll die in six months and your mind
[50:50] believes it you'll most likely will die
[50:53] in six months yeah that's called nocebo
[50:56] effect the result of a negative thought
[50:59] I mean this the only reason I put this
[51:03] up because it just synopsize a good
[51:05] synopsis of what we've been going
[51:06] through which is the opposite of the
[51:08] placebo effect where healing is mediated
[51:12] by a positive thought my you really get
[51:18] what I mean you know thoughts yeah I
[51:20] mean you type in what is a thought and
[51:24] you don't they don't even know because
[51:25] it's and we know what a thought is
[51:28] that's actually God God gave us those
[51:32] thoughts you know that's the Word of God
[51:33] it's the it's actually general thought
[51:36] is generated by the nature of God or the
[51:38] nature of Satan it's two powers on this
[51:42] earth and there's good thoughts and then
[51:45] there's evil thoughts it's only two
[51:47] really so any thought that you think it
[51:52] can be traced back with a how far you
[51:54] need to go back to - yeah that's it amen
[51:58] amen
[52:01] my
[52:03] so you see thought is powerful now when
[52:08] you can catch God's thought catch the
[52:11] concept that God has revealed there is
[52:16] great power in that the dynamic points
[52:20] to a three-party system is the part of
[52:24] you that swears it doesn't want to die
[52:27] the conscious mind trumped by the part
[52:32] that believes you will the doctor's
[52:35] prognosis mediated by the subconscious
[52:40] mind you see now in the doctor comes and
[52:45] tells you you're going to die you got
[52:47] six months prepare there's nothing we
[52:49] can do all those fears and whatever
[52:52] movies you've watched it if you've seen
[52:54] in all those things and traumas and
[52:56] stuff that you've gone through in your
[52:57] life and the emotions it all just comes
[52:59] and overwhelms what is it doing because
[53:02] in that same subconscious as that seed
[53:04] of faith and it's to all those enemies
[53:07] that Amalekites Confederate together
[53:09] hallelujah
[53:10] sorry I just have to say they
[53:12] Confederate together and all that fear
[53:14] and all that fear mongering and all
[53:16] those complexes and they just try and
[53:18] that faith and they're pushing
[53:20] it down
[53:21] hallelujah but you know what happens
[53:23] when when you know that faith you know
[53:25] when it goes under pressure
[53:27] hallelujah it just performs better amen
[53:29] hallelujah
[53:30] you cannot crush faith hallelujah no
[53:33] matter what you do you cannot crush
[53:35] faith because if God placed it faith
[53:37] Alleluia something's going to
[53:39] something's going to give
[53:40] amen something's going to give I believe
[53:43] that a real faith that's why you see you
[53:46] know the syrophoenician woman that the
[53:49] disciples rejected her the demons were
[53:52] tormenting her and all of whatever was
[53:55] wrong and everything is going wrong in
[53:57] her life and even Jesus called her a
[53:59] doll yeah hallelujah but she did not
[54:02] give up Amen no matter what people did
[54:05] or what anything there was nothing that
[54:08] could stop because there was faith
[54:10] inside there no matter what happened no
[54:12] matter who rejected her no matter what
[54:14] people called her a do to
[54:16] no matter how much she thought it was
[54:17] wrong about something deep down was just
[54:20] just had to get that amen and faith was
[54:24] never destroyed faith fail not Amen
[54:27] Alleluia amen
[54:29] and so you can be criticized you can be
[54:32] ostracized you can be kidding you can be
[54:35] so hard done by by a message church you
[54:39] know and people have been and a lot of
[54:42] people have left and gone maybe there
[54:44] was nothing there and then there's a lot
[54:47] of people that stayed and I continued on
[54:49] there was nothing that the pastor can
[54:51] say wrong
[54:52] that will keep kick them make them go
[54:57] well they talk to me no nothing
[55:00] they just keep very oh no they say oh
[55:02] well you know maybe the Lord needs to
[55:04] help them a little bit or whatever the
[55:06] pastor's a bit mad at me or he doesn't
[55:08] understand or whatever or you just need
[55:10] to move on or what I don't know I mean
[55:12] this is not for us but this is just a
[55:14] general comment but this has happened
[55:17] now what I'm trying to say is that faith
[55:20] will not be deterred like by anything
[55:23] that man can do or anything that Satan
[55:25] can do it's going to conquer hallelujah
[55:30] amen but you see still in that
[55:33] subconscious now that's where the war is
[55:35] all taking place and so you see now the
[55:40] conscious mind he's saying here is
[55:42] trumped by this subconscious mind
[55:44] because the conscious mind is 5% of your
[55:46] spirit and the subconscious is 95% so
[55:51] you can see there's a lot more influence
[55:52] that your subconscious head and this is
[55:54] what really generated my interest in
[55:56] this whole subject was if there's so
[55:58] much influence in your life by your
[56:01] subconscious and then brother Brandon
[56:03] says everything is actually in there
[56:04] your faith is in there your soul is
[56:06] actually nested inside your subconscious
[56:09] because it goes sole subconscious and
[56:12] then body you know it's actually all of
[56:14] its nested inside there and then it
[56:16] grows from in there and pushes and comes
[56:18] in to conquer it comes to dominate it
[56:21] comes into its Dominion from within the
[56:24] land God places you within the land and
[56:27] then he asks you to now
[56:29] go tour them take it and see and you see
[56:33] now ratsy brother Bram says that when
[56:36] you get the Holy Ghost says it's God's
[56:39] life now comes and is blending with your
[56:42] life and eventually all that little
[56:46] darkness and things that's actually
[56:47] that's why it's so important we need the
[56:49] Holy Ghost because if you don't have the
[56:51] Holy Ghost it's just going to stake that
[56:52] listen yeah but when the Holy Ghost
[56:54] comes in it's like a light comes on and
[56:56] it just blends over now you don't lose
[56:59] your identity because you are you and
[57:02] God made you thus but all the darkness
[57:03] that's in your diet entity starts to
[57:05] fade away it starts to leave and it
[57:08] happens amen
[57:10] life anyway the doctor's prognosis
[57:14] mediated by the subconscious mind which
[57:16] then throws in together chemical
[57:18] reaction mediated by the brains
[57:21] chemistry so this is probably quite
[57:23] complicated but I just didn't want to
[57:26] really understand everything that's
[57:27] going on in here but just the main floor
[57:29] here to make sure the body conforms to
[57:31] the dominant belief neuroscience is
[57:34] recognized that the subconscious
[57:36] controls 95% of our lives now what about
[57:40] the part that doesn't want to die
[57:42] the conscious mind isn't it impacting
[57:46] the body's chemistry as well dr. Lipton
[57:48] says that it comes down to how the
[57:50] subconscious mind which contains our
[57:52] deepest beliefs has been programmed it
[57:55] is these beliefs that ultimately cast
[57:58] the deciding vote my and so you can see
[58:02] now why we've been so interested and
[58:05] getting this subconscious mind and
[58:08] harmony with the word and why the
[58:11] Prophet puts so much weight on the
[58:14] subconscious actually getting fixed
[58:17] getting healed getting in line with the
[58:21] word he says when you can get the man
[58:24] upstairs this is the conscious mind in
[58:27] harmony with the subconscious mind in
[58:30] harmony with the word you're lining up
[58:33] the three and then he says whatever you
[58:36] say will happen because there will be
[58:38] nothing in your life to cast a false
[58:42] deciding boat
[58:43] there'll be nothing to overthrow the
[58:45] vote and so for me I got very excited
[58:48] when I heard this because I was like man
[58:50] how do we actually change this thing
[58:52] then and what where does it because you
[58:54] always want to know okay what part does
[58:56] God play in this what does he do for me
[58:58] what is he going to do what are his
[59:00] covenants and then what does he expect
[59:02] from me what does he want me to put into
[59:05] practice and that's where it all opened
[59:07] up that you become a doer of the word
[59:10] and not just the hearer and now what
[59:13] we've been doing over the series is
[59:14] identifying what parts of the word that
[59:17] you can that you should normally just
[59:20] practice anyway but we're just we're
[59:21] just shining a light on what you should
[59:23] normally practice so that you can go
[59:25] okay I'm going to put a bit of emphasis
[59:26] here because I can diagnose in my own
[59:29] life I've got a deficit in this part of
[59:31] my character and I've prayed and gods
[59:33] healed me
[59:34] I've been delivered maybe at the initial
[59:36] stages there was demon power in there
[59:38] you might have been possessed by a demon
[59:39] and it's taken over your life and you
[59:41] got delivered and then you over the
[59:44] years you got healed of it but there's
[59:46] still the habit and that that neural
[59:50] pathway that plasticity inside your mind
[59:52] that still does that and it's a
[59:54] character form sometimes and many times
[59:56] we don't even see it in ourselves it's
[59:58] actually the our wife or husband that
[1:00:00] points it out and it's the thing that
[1:00:02] probably annoys them a lot you know and
[1:00:04] and other people that you're close to
[1:00:05] they know those things too I know those
[1:00:09] things and so now by diagnosing those
[1:00:11] things you actually and you and being
[1:00:15] healed of it and died and you're
[1:00:16] diagnosing you've been healed of it and
[1:00:18] you've been delivered whatever but now
[1:00:20] it's time and you've been up for prayer
[1:00:23] baby three four five times whatever to
[1:00:26] get rid of this thing and it just keeps
[1:00:27] coming back because saying actually I
[1:00:29] want you to actually start doing putting
[1:00:31] off the old conversation I want you to
[1:00:34] start actually putting into practice my
[1:00:36] word which is the antidote remember what
[1:00:39] we spoke about the antidote antidote
[1:00:41] brother branham actually put a lot of
[1:00:43] weight on the antidote he said that at
[1:00:45] all actually
[1:00:46] but at all he says he put the word he
[1:00:49] actually applied the word anything he
[1:00:52] said it will actually change anything
[1:00:54] amen
[1:00:55] so whatever
[1:00:56] the floor is in your life the antidotes
[1:00:59] going to is an antidote for it and by
[1:01:02] acting upon that and deliberately doing
[1:01:03] that because you have dominion because
[1:01:06] this grace of God because you're not
[1:01:07] feeding the black dog anymore and and
[1:01:10] overcome by the evil and you're feeding
[1:01:12] that white dog you're strong enough to
[1:01:14] actually start making a conscious
[1:01:16] decision to do the antidote to do the
[1:01:18] right thing to start rewiring the system
[1:01:21] to start retraining the crew downstairs
[1:01:26] that subconscious mind to change your
[1:01:30] deepest beliefs because remember your
[1:01:35] soul believes the whole litical sealed
[1:01:38] if you're sealed seal it believes the
[1:01:41] soul believes there's no question never
[1:01:43] questions it but now you've got to get
[1:01:46] the subconscious to believe and what the
[1:01:49] deepest beliefs are in that subconscious
[1:01:52] will cast the deciding vote and I like
[1:01:54] it how they've word it there so right
[1:01:55] it's exactly what brother Branham seed
[1:01:58] said he's the one that gives you all the
[1:02:00] trouble yeah and actually if you if you
[1:02:06] bring it over thought together into a
[1:02:08] consolidated thought that's the only
[1:02:11] part of you that's actually stopping you
[1:02:14] from becoming a full manifested son of
[1:02:16] God and it's kind of and then when I saw
[1:02:19] that I thought well that's actually
[1:02:20] time-lock then it's time locked by the
[1:02:23] Lord's deliverance in your life it's
[1:02:26] time locked because the Lord doesn't
[1:02:28] it's not the season he's well it is the
[1:02:31] season but it's you know we're right at
[1:02:32] the end of the season but it's still
[1:02:34] this development still to heaven this
[1:02:35] furtherance in our lives you know
[1:02:38] there's an advancement to happen in our
[1:02:39] lives now that is actually if you are
[1:02:43] surrendered to God you're going to
[1:02:45] unfold according to the program
[1:02:47] according to what God has done and is
[1:02:50] doing in your life and when it when
[1:02:52] you're ready when you've got maturity to
[1:02:54] handle a bit more freedom and a bit more
[1:02:56] power and a bit more effectual faith
[1:03:00] he'll give it to you he'll Drive that
[1:03:02] enemy away you'll drive another any of
[1:03:06] my way to one day just before the
[1:03:09] rapture
[1:03:10] maybe I don't know just just one day
[1:03:12] there'll be nothing in your life nothing
[1:03:15] that will cast a false deciding vote
[1:03:18] it'll all be positive faith there'll be
[1:03:21] you whatever you say now you'll have the
[1:03:24] maturity in the character to handle that
[1:03:26] that's actually that's supreme power
[1:03:29] omnipotent that's a militant now you'll
[1:03:33] have the character to actually be
[1:03:35] completely submitted to the Lord
[1:03:38] completely you'll never do anything
[1:03:41] outside of his mind outside of his wish
[1:03:43] will outside of him it'll be completely
[1:03:46] connected your what you desire He
[1:03:50] desires what you love he loves what you
[1:03:52] hates he hates and we'll all be
[1:03:54] connected and I believe we're coming to
[1:03:55] that place you see in and the way we
[1:03:58] come to that place is by hardship trials
[1:04:01] and will the way we get trials is by
[1:04:04] doing the will of God
[1:04:06] that's all connected you know by
[1:04:08] actually putting into place surrendering
[1:04:10] your gifts to the Lord laying your life
[1:04:12] down becoming a real threat to Satan and
[1:04:15] all his help and that's when they start
[1:04:17] attacking that's when they start going
[1:04:19] in petitioning Father about how they
[1:04:21] want how they want to get you and the
[1:04:25] Lord says all right he's got enough
[1:04:26] character now do whatever you need to
[1:04:29] whatever just don't take his life and
[1:04:31] put a few boundaries on them and then
[1:04:33] he'll you know it'd be exactly - to
[1:04:37] refine you exactly and you know that
[1:04:40] would race as the battle is there is the
[1:04:44] fight and it's predestined its
[1:04:47] pre-planned it's actually pre-planned by
[1:04:50] God your whole fight your whole battle
[1:04:54] your race that you're running with
[1:04:56] patience it's been preached you know
[1:04:59] you're very patient because you want
[1:05:02] your conscious mind all I need to get
[1:05:03] this done and or there's so many things
[1:05:05] in my life that need to be delivered and
[1:05:07] you want all those things done but you
[1:05:08] see now you're going to be patient
[1:05:10] because God has got a plan
[1:05:11] and he's gonna he's got divine
[1:05:13] appointments to happen he's got some
[1:05:15] enemies to come across your path he's
[1:05:17] got things to happen things to annoy you
[1:05:19] and things to make you squirm and things
[1:05:22] to embarrass you
[1:05:23] and failures for you to make to get rid
[1:05:27] of pride and to get rid of anything
[1:05:29] that's going to hinder the work work of
[1:05:31] God in your life I'll just keep reading
[1:05:38] this that's a complex situation said dr.
[1:05:41] Lipton people have been programmed to
[1:05:43] believe that their victims and that they
[1:05:46] have no control we're programmed from
[1:05:49] the start with our mother and father's
[1:05:51] beliefs so for instance at home aren't
[1:05:54] you so thankful and these children need
[1:05:55] to be really blessed and really
[1:05:57] recognize that you're programmed by some
[1:06:00] pretty good beliefs man there's a lot of
[1:06:03] children out there and I was one of them
[1:06:04] that was not programmed by these things
[1:06:06] and so you see there's a lot of battles
[1:06:08] in my life that that like the life had
[1:06:11] to go through because of these false
[1:06:13] programs that you children and children
[1:06:16] whoever hears this you know an
[1:06:17] appearance we all must our children need
[1:06:21] to recognize how blessed they are amen
[1:06:24] in it and the Lord gives you grace and
[1:06:26] me grace to be able to convey that to
[1:06:27] them and they see that and actually on
[1:06:31] another level or god help us that they
[1:06:34] see Christ that they see that image
[1:06:37] because it's not so much yes it is what
[1:06:39] we say but it's a lot on what we do and
[1:06:41] in our body language and and in our
[1:06:44] actions and our reactions and the way we
[1:06:46] conduct ourselves and carry ourselves
[1:06:48] mine in the middle of this Babylonian
[1:06:51] mess our children are watching
[1:06:56] so we're programmed from the start with
[1:06:58] our mother and father's beliefs so for
[1:07:00] instance when we got sick we were told
[1:07:02] by our parents that we had to go to the
[1:07:04] doctor because the doctor is the
[1:07:07] authority concerning our health we all
[1:07:09] got the message throughout childhood
[1:07:11] well we're all okay so this isn't him
[1:07:14] that we we got the message throughout
[1:07:16] childhood that doctors were the
[1:07:18] authority on health and that we were
[1:07:20] victims of bodily forces beyond our
[1:07:23] ability to control that's exactly what
[1:07:26] my upbringing was exactly there was no
[1:07:29] other option it was just whatever you
[1:07:32] know it was that was it was hopeless
[1:07:34] there's a hopelessness
[1:07:36] and so you can see now anyway the joke
[1:07:42] however is that people often get better
[1:07:45] while on the way to the doctor that's
[1:07:48] when the I Nate ability for self healing
[1:07:50] kicks in another example of the placebo
[1:07:52] effect I don't know about that but
[1:07:54] anyway
[1:08:03] we're just going to teach this
[1:08:16] dealing with nervousness I'm just going
[1:08:22] to go through this is just laying a
[1:08:23] foundation for what we want to show you
[1:08:25] later brother Branham says now the first
[1:08:28] thing the lady is suffering with a
[1:08:29] tremendous nervous condition she's just
[1:08:32] on the verge of a breakdown she feels
[1:08:34] like that she's about lost her mind
[1:08:37] the reason is is because of a burden
[1:08:39] she's burdened about somebody she has a
[1:08:42] burden on her heart and a person is her
[1:08:44] husband and the man has got something
[1:08:46] like a stroke or something that's
[1:08:47] bothered him and she's pulled around
[1:08:49] with him until it's caused due to have a
[1:08:52] breakdown that's the truth is that right
[1:08:55] if it is raise your hand so R is under
[1:08:58] the discernment now this is God speaking
[1:08:59] do you believe now with all your heart
[1:09:04] there's a lot of lessons in this a lot
[1:09:07] and the way he's dealing with that and
[1:09:10] she in and he's now the question he puts
[1:09:14] there is a lot of wisdom in that
[1:09:15] do you believe with all your heart now
[1:09:18] she's actually going to think about that
[1:09:19] do I actually really believe that and
[1:09:23] she's and really in her she's going to
[1:09:26] actually master up that kind of faith
[1:09:29] and say yes I do because faith got her
[1:09:34] to this position a lot most of the time
[1:09:38] faith was what got people a prayer card
[1:09:41] you know they believed in God answered
[1:09:43] their faith and gave them a prayer card
[1:09:44] or or they got called out unto thee into
[1:09:47] the you know they were out in the
[1:09:49] congregation and brother Branham called
[1:09:50] them out by faith they touched the hem
[1:09:53] of Jesus garment so she got faith to get
[1:09:56] so far and now she's got faithful all of
[1:09:58] her heart do you really believe this
[1:10:00] with all that's within you all your
[1:10:04] heart has to be all your heart
[1:10:08] look Satan is just now you feel alright
[1:10:12] now see you feel better because as soon
[1:10:14] as you accept that it that feeling left
[1:10:17] you see it's gone now that's right
[1:10:21] see you don't feel it now do you it's
[1:10:24] gone from you if that's right raise up
[1:10:26] your hand if that weary feeling left you
[1:10:29] see because I seen it when it left see
[1:10:32] but that's just the shadow now it can't
[1:10:34] hurt you it's the devil see and he won't
[1:10:37] come to you no more if you'll believe it
[1:10:40] now you see brother branham here he said
[1:10:43] the first thing is diagnose it he
[1:10:48] exposed the devil diagnosed it she asked
[1:10:52] her do you believe with all your heart
[1:10:53] and he prayed and the demon left she was
[1:10:57] delivered of a demon a devil left - but
[1:11:03] you see now even when the devil's left
[1:11:05] there's still some things to take place
[1:11:07] it needs to be healing take place there
[1:11:09] needs to be something that's going to
[1:11:10] replace them because I seen it when it
[1:11:19] left okay now he's preaching to her and
[1:11:22] now he's telling her and he won't come
[1:11:26] to you no more now he's actually
[1:11:27] speaking vision speaking to her telling
[1:11:31] her positive things he's actually
[1:11:33] speaking a positive vision to him but
[1:11:36] she needs to believe it that's always by
[1:11:39] faith everything that you do and all
[1:11:41] that I've told you do it in faith say
[1:11:44] the things that I tell you to say say it
[1:11:46] in faith these words that you speak
[1:11:49] positive testimonies positive
[1:11:51] affirmations confessions don't just
[1:11:53] confess it on an intellectual level
[1:11:54] confess it by faith amen because you see
[1:11:59] everything you confess there's nothing
[1:12:01] that I've put in here that - for you to
[1:12:03] confess that isn't what the word says
[1:12:04] about you and if the words is that about
[1:12:07] you it is the wound that's what the word
[1:12:09] says about you it might not be a
[1:12:10] verbatim scripture but it is the it is
[1:12:15] the scripture it is the Bible that's
[1:12:17] what the Bible says about you now you
[1:12:20] can if you
[1:12:21] why that way and you want to just
[1:12:24] confess in a bottom verse feel free
[1:12:27] nothing wrong with that
[1:12:28] sometimes verses are a bit long and it's
[1:12:30] hard for you to remember but if you can
[1:12:32] memorize it praise God
[1:12:34] but I'm going to give you some things to
[1:12:36] say that that are the what the word says
[1:12:40] about you
[1:12:40] now when you confess that confess it by
[1:12:43] faith believing that there's power in
[1:12:45] that word to change your life to
[1:12:50] restructure your spirit to restructure
[1:12:52] your subconscious mind to change what
[1:12:55] you believe about yourself to retrain
[1:12:57] the crew downstairs so that that crew
[1:13:00] can steer the ship when you give it
[1:13:01] directions when you hear something you
[1:13:03] get excited up here and you're like yes
[1:13:05] I believe that but downstairs it's like
[1:13:06] no no no fear fear fear to unbelief
[1:13:10] doubt all those things because all those
[1:13:13] years you fought negatively about stuff
[1:13:15] and you keep thinking this and you
[1:13:16] thought that oh if I don't say it
[1:13:18] doesn't it's not as long as I just don't
[1:13:21] say it that you thought about it and all
[1:13:23] those thoughts for all your life of went
[1:13:25] downstairs and retrain and trained that
[1:13:27] crew to be negative so that when you get
[1:13:29] excited about some promise of God and
[1:13:31] you say yes I'm going to take that I'm
[1:13:33] going to believe that but downstairs the
[1:13:34] crews been trained so long the opposite
[1:13:37] way so there has to be a change there
[1:13:40] has to be a lifestyle change a
[1:13:42] confession change a thought change and
[1:13:44] it actually isn't an easy thing because
[1:13:48] you become so engrained in the way you
[1:13:49] think and the way you react to things
[1:13:51] that you actually got to make a
[1:13:53] conscious effort and you it's going to
[1:13:55] take prayer it take perseverance but
[1:13:57] there is a faith in you and that faith
[1:13:59] needs to confess the word and that power
[1:14:02] and that word will actually come and
[1:14:04] God's grace will change you God's grace
[1:14:06] will give you the ability to do it
[1:14:07] because he asked you to put off that old
[1:14:10] conversation to put off that old manner
[1:14:12] of life and put on Jesus Christ which
[1:14:14] has created a new creation and a new way
[1:14:17] of life a new walk all things made you
[1:14:21] Alleluia so says here and this is where
[1:14:24] it gets really good he says you believe
[1:14:26] that you're standing by Jesus Christ now
[1:14:28] which is a supernatural being here
[1:14:31] that'll keep him away from you all the
[1:14:33] days of your life hello
[1:14:35] so you see you can be delivered by a
[1:14:37] devil from it sorry delivered from a
[1:14:39] devil and then the Lord can keep that
[1:14:41] devil away from you all the days of your
[1:14:43] life and that will not exhaust the
[1:14:45] energy of God he will kick that thing
[1:14:49] away from you and it will try come back
[1:14:51] at all those things but as long as you
[1:14:52] just walk in faith and you continue and
[1:14:54] sin no more but see you can get
[1:14:57] delivered of something but if you just
[1:14:58] go back like a pig towards wallowing in
[1:15:00] the mire then you'll just get that demon
[1:15:02] has just as much legal right to come
[1:15:04] back but if you get delivered of a devil
[1:15:06] and then you sin no more as Jesus said
[1:15:09] to those many people is it I've now
[1:15:11] delivered you I've now healed you now
[1:15:13] sin no more don't go back to those
[1:15:15] things that that actually cause that
[1:15:17] devil to come into your life don't go
[1:15:19] back to it ever again because you're
[1:15:22] free now you've been given the grace and
[1:15:24] the power to change and now the word of
[1:15:27] God come forth to give you instruction
[1:15:29] and righteousness and how to conduct and
[1:15:30] how to actually apply these things so
[1:15:32] that the habits can go as well because
[1:15:35] that's really what can actually get
[1:15:37] people back is the habitual side of it
[1:15:40] as the bit that's ingrained in your
[1:15:42] thinking and ingrained in your culture
[1:15:44] and ingrained in your flesh and all your
[1:15:46] neural plasticity and in your brain and
[1:15:49] all your neural pathways and all those
[1:15:50] things that's what gets the people back
[1:15:53] after they've been delivered and healed
[1:15:55] of the scars and whatever trauma they
[1:15:57] went through the habits bring them back
[1:16:00] and then you know what comes back the
[1:16:03] demons come back the Devils come back
[1:16:05] and they start plaguing and the very
[1:16:09] emotional things that went on in
[1:16:11] subconscious come back and it all comes
[1:16:13] back and you end up seven times worse
[1:16:15] you're going but he says but now listen
[1:16:19] he says that'll keep them away from you
[1:16:21] all the days of your life you're going

[1:16:29] rejoicing you have to he's preaching a

[1:16:49] being delivered from that and now
[1:16:52] provisions been preached to her you're
[1:16:55] going to be under protect divine
[1:16:56] protection but now you've got to make a
[1:16:59] conscious choice to go out and be happy
[1:17:02] and rejoice now when you start doing
[1:17:06] that it's going to start changing your
[1:17:08] neuro-pathways it's going to start
[1:17:10] changing your habits it's going to start
[1:17:11] changing your subconscious it's going to
[1:17:13] start retraining the crew downstairs so
[1:17:15] that they start becoming a rejoicing
[1:17:17] person
[1:17:18] it's that rejoicing about the Lord and
[1:17:19] all of a sudden you'll start really
[1:17:21] recognizing how much you need to rejoice
[1:17:23] because you just rejoice because you're
[1:17:25] so happy that what you have you get
[1:17:28] happier and happier and more joy and

[1:18:14] happy as you can be singing hymns and
[1:18:16] praising God so she's been given now a
[1:18:19] practical instruction to do the opposite
[1:18:22] of what her actual makeup was because
[1:18:26] her makeup and the way her disposition
[1:18:29] and her culture and whatever a-fixin her
[1:18:31] life and her upbringing and all that
[1:18:33] stuff had brought it to a place of
[1:18:34] nervousness and the things that she went
[1:18:36] through and the burdens that she carried
[1:18:37] and she just got overwhelmed by them all
[1:18:39] now the Prophet or God through the
[1:18:42] Prophet now telling her you need to do
[1:18:44] the opposite I'm going to give you a
[1:18:45] different way of life a different

[1:18:49] change the way

[1:18:52] positive person that's happy because if
[1:18:55] you don't you'll end up down more but
[1:18:57] again and you'll start agreeing to demon
[1:18:59] power lice and then if you excite
[1:19:00] agreeing to the demon power lies you the
[1:19:02] demons will come back because you agree
[1:19:05] to them and you start welcoming them
[1:19:07] back in and you get down and morbid and
[1:19:09] depressed all those things are nervous
[1:19:11] and shaking and all those things and you
[1:19:13] actually lose your identity you start to
[1:19:17] become spiritually amnesia you forget
[1:19:22] who you are
[1:19:23] you see some when someone's really
[1:19:25] rejoicing about something really
[1:19:27] genuinely rejoicing and they recognize
[1:19:29] who they are they're like I'm so happy
[1:19:31] that I'm a Christian I'm so happy that
[1:19:33] I'm a son of God and you get so excited
[1:19:36] about the prospect of your future about
[1:19:39] what you're actually going into and like
[1:19:40] what's happening next in you you know
[1:19:42] that novelty of being a Christian and
[1:19:44] what God's got for you and what is
[1:19:46] unfolding to you you're so it's exciting
[1:19:49] it's so exciting being a Christian amen
[1:19:52] when you're connected to that identity
[1:19:54] man when you're connected to that you
[1:19:56] know it's and you rejoice about it
[1:19:59] there's all these practices that
[1:20:00] actually is so amazing it's so simple a
[1:20:04] well-trained crew is a great asset
[1:20:07] hallelujah you can imagine you know your
[1:20:11] crew is basically you know them if your
[1:20:15] crew is a real negative crew your poor
[1:20:17] conscious mind has got a very bad
[1:20:19] environment to work on it's like having
[1:20:22] a business that has a whole bunch of bad
[1:20:24] stuff and they just you know you tell
[1:20:27] them to do something and they do the
[1:20:28] opposite or they do stuff that you they
[1:20:34] do their own thing and with that
[1:20:36] business especially if it's a bigger
[1:20:38] business it will just never really go
[1:20:41] with the vision of the of the owner of
[1:20:44] the business the you know and so you see
[1:20:47] it's the same as a ship actually won't
[1:20:52] go there yet the conscious mind you see
[1:20:54] now you if the crew downstairs is all
[1:20:57] good because when you make a decision to
[1:20:59] do something because you get excited
[1:21:01] about the word
[1:21:02] and you reason it out and it's
[1:21:04] reasonable and you reason with God and
[1:21:06] you reason together he says come and let
[1:21:08] us reason together and you like yes and
[1:21:10] I agree with that it's so clear now
[1:21:11] downstairs if they're all ante and
[1:21:14] whatever has been trained so many years
[1:21:16] wrong and false you know there it
[1:21:18] becomes a bad environment because you
[1:21:21] see now that bad environment is not able
[1:21:24] to get become wholesome and and healed
[1:21:27] and well and and happy a happy spirit a
[1:21:31] happy wife keeping the house you know a
[1:21:34] happy body a happy balanced atmosphere
[1:21:36] and so that conscious mind is dealing
[1:21:39] with a whole lot of thing and it's a
[1:21:40] sandwich because your soul believes the
[1:21:42] word and there's the Holy Ghost inside
[1:21:44] your soul if you're born again got a
[1:21:47] certain thing to do and he's convicting
[1:21:49] you of this and you've putting his
[1:21:50] finger on this and your conscious mind
[1:21:52] says yes that I can't because the
[1:21:57] subconscious has got so many fears and
[1:21:59] problems and anxieties and dispersed the
[1:22:01] depressions and unable to communicate
[1:22:03] and can't can't receive love and can't
[1:22:05] give love and all those things because
[1:22:07] of all these things that's gone on all
[1:22:08] and so you your conscious mind which is
[1:22:12] the hub of your ten senses the hub of
[1:22:14] all your see taste feel smell in here
[1:22:16] and the hub of your you know your
[1:22:18] affections and reasons and conscience
[1:22:20] and all those things it's all hub than
[1:22:22] your conscience that's why it's the
[1:22:23] control tower you know it's there it's
[1:22:24] the bridge of the ship brother branham
[1:22:26] calls it that's where it all kind of
[1:22:27] takes place you know the the decisions
[1:22:30] and the direction and where we're going
[1:22:31] to go so now that poor bridge of the
[1:22:35] ship has got no air conditioning and so
[1:22:38] the atmosphere is very bad and it's got
[1:22:40] no heat up displays and so there's no
[1:22:42] vision you can't see amen
[1:22:45] it's got no stabilizing power because
[1:22:48] you can't push the button to stabilize
[1:22:49] the ship and there's no navigation
[1:22:51] because it's just getting torn about and
[1:22:53] tossed by all of the crew downstairs and
[1:22:55] they don't even run all the machines
[1:22:57] properly and so and there's no comms so
[1:23:01] all of the stuff is just going awry
[1:23:02] because really the stuff the mechanical
[1:23:06] downstairs in the body it's not playing
[1:23:08] the game it's not balanced it's not
[1:23:10] entombed it's not under submission happy
[1:23:14] it might be under submission by duress
[1:23:16] you might be ruling your spirit by
[1:23:19] malevolent rulership by legalism and
[1:23:22] that's not happy and so yes you're just
[1:23:25] performing just enough to sit in church
[1:23:27] and make everyone think you're so good
[1:23:29] but really what's going on is there's a
[1:23:32] big revolt happening downstairs it's
[1:23:34] causing trouble and causing pain and
[1:23:36] then on the other side the soul is
[1:23:39] wanting you to do ride and and your soul
[1:23:42] is saying the word of god and the word
[1:23:45] of god is so true and here's the will of
[1:23:47] God for your life and in this conscious
[1:23:49] mind is in a bad environment a very torn
[1:23:52] - minded environment but a well-trained
[1:23:56] crew is a great asset amen and all the
[1:24:00] navigation machines are all working able
[1:24:03] to be led by the Spirit amen connected
[1:24:05] to heaven hallelujah can in every
[1:24:07] situation a balanced reaction hallelujah
[1:24:10] you know through a stabilization brother
[1:24:13] Brennan said the stabilizers have been
[1:24:15] put on the ships you know the the great
[1:24:18] waves are roaring in this day but the
[1:24:21] stabilizers have been placed hallelujah
[1:24:24] the ships now going to crest every wave
[1:24:26] amen
[1:24:27] hallelujah see now that crew that's in
[1:24:32] tune that crew that's been trained well
[1:24:35] retrained because now you know you've
[1:24:38] been given the wisdom you've been given
[1:24:40] the knowledge you won't perish
[1:24:41] you're not going to perish by coming
[1:24:44] under an emotional storm of this
[1:24:46] Babylonian age you're able to create an
[1:24:52] atmosphere its air-conditioning in the
[1:24:55] bridge and the communication because
[1:24:58] your circles you see up here you can
[1:24:59] reason it out in your soul yes in the
[1:25:01] subconscious yes that actually is being
[1:25:04] healed that can receive love
[1:25:13] you need to really make the conscious
[1:25:15] environment to bring a real clear
[1:25:19] navigation a stabilization and air
[1:25:21] conditioning a comms in an HUD so that
[1:25:24] the ship can actually be stared right so
[1:25:27] that the ship can actually go in the
[1:25:29] direction of the Holy Ghost so that the
[1:25:31] ship can move with the pillar of fire
[1:25:33] and what the Lord's doing and the ship
[1:25:36] can actually Crist and brother Bram said
[1:25:39] very soon the Lord we will we're going
[1:25:42] to we're going to we're going to
[1:25:44] whatever you call it we're going to
[1:25:47] disembark upon the new world amen we're
[1:25:49] going to we're going to we're going to
[1:25:51] reach the shores hallelujah and we're
[1:25:54] going to go and have a winning supper

[1:26:09] - it's a whale we got a dock Amen
[1:26:17] Alleluia

[1:26:19] navigation you've got to be supported by
[1:26:21] the crew hallelujah got to get all of
[1:26:23] those three in alignment amen
[1:26:25] we're about running out of time here and
[1:26:27] I want to get to the point here so here
[1:26:29] we've got now I ask these questions what
[1:26:31] are you speaking in where are you
[1:26:32] heating a wholesome tongue is a tree of
[1:26:36] life but a perverseness Theron is a
[1:26:39] bridge and the spirit remember the in
[1:26:42] the same book of Proverbs this is he
[1:26:45] there has no control over his own spirit
[1:26:47] is like a city broken down without walls
[1:26:50] so the spirit is he is the soul and the
[1:26:54] spirit is what you need to get control
[1:26:56] over by a true benevolent leadership by
[1:27:00] a loving leadership in your own life
[1:27:02] because you see the Lord holds you
[1:27:04] accountable on how you lead and he's
[1:27:07] going to teach you to lead in your own
[1:27:12] life by your own spirit teach you to
[1:27:15] lead your spirit right not under duress
[1:27:18] or you better behave or no actually
[1:27:22] coming
[1:27:23] drawing on the eternal resource of God

[1:27:29] and to act in a certain way to be a
[1:27:31] certain way by faith to see a real
[1:27:34] change a lasting change a lifestyle

[1:27:45] much so
[1:27:46] amen a wholesome tongue is a tree of
[1:27:50] life man butter / versus the breach in
[1:27:53] the spirit you see now we go into
[1:27:56] healing by spiritual medicine brother
[1:27:58] Branham says in order to stay with God
[1:28:00] stay gentle God is gentle in order to
[1:28:03] stay with God stay with love God is love
[1:28:05] they make not Nevers be self-sufficient
[1:28:09] don't think of yourself as this big
[1:28:11] sufficient thing and able to do all
[1:28:13] these things always rely on God always
[1:28:17] conduct yourself with meekness and
[1:28:19] lowliness as low and as making it humble
[1:28:21] in this kind as you can be because you
[1:28:24] are human and there are still fleshly
[1:28:26] things that are going to annoy other
[1:28:28] people and so if you should become this
[1:28:30] dominant it's going to start annoying
[1:28:33] people you caused wrong atmosphere
[1:28:35] that's why yes God wants us to develop
[1:28:38] into who we are and all of that but you
[1:28:41] see even if you're so you're gifted and
[1:28:45] whatever always carry those gifts and
[1:28:47] humility always be meek it always you
[1:28:50] know be think about us you know and
[1:28:52] think about others before yourself and
[1:28:54] those things in the reason he sees that
[1:28:55] is because he he wants an atmosphere he
[1:28:59] wants the church he wants the local body
[1:29:02] to be in an atmosphere and when
[1:29:05] everyone's meek and kind to each other
[1:29:07] in that atmosphere the devil can't use
[1:29:10] their floors to annoy each other and
[1:29:13] start causing pains and problems and
[1:29:15] troubles and fighting amen
[1:29:18] always rely on him never use your own
[1:29:21] mind take his thoughts let his thoughts
[1:29:25] be your thoughts and take them into your
[1:29:28] carnal mind and repeat them over Amen
[1:29:33] Alleluia and that's going to be a theme
[1:29:36] for
[1:29:36] so the plan of attack and I'm just going
[1:29:39] to we will not preach now he's going to
[1:29:41] teach purely because I don't have time
[1:29:43] to preach here diagnose uncover what God
[1:29:47] is dealing with now don't get
[1:29:49] overwhelmed by the whole battle like I
[1:29:52] said before you can you'll probably pick
[1:29:54] a few things in your own life that you
[1:29:56] know is the trouble don't try and have
[1:29:57] God deal with all of them all at once
[1:29:59] God doesn't work like that well maybe he
[1:30:02] does sometimes this is but generally and
[1:30:04] what we've seen in the types is that God
[1:30:07] deals with one thing at a time he'll
[1:30:09] deal with one enemy at a time he will do
[1:30:12] one thing at a time for you right in
[1:30:15] your own life so don't get overwhelmed
[1:30:18] with the whole thing with all your
[1:30:21] faults and all your problems because
[1:30:22] people do that and then they think
[1:30:23] they're useless and they're down and
[1:30:25] they can't ever get anywhere in life
[1:30:26] they're never going to amount to
[1:30:27] anything and they've been told that all
[1:30:28] their life maybe don't get overwhelmed
[1:30:32] by the whole thing
[1:30:33] by all your problems and all your fault
[1:30:35] but find out what God is dealing with
[1:30:37] right now
[1:30:37] find out that fault that character
[1:30:40] defect or that complex or debt that scar
[1:30:43] or that whatever it may be it's severe
[1:30:47] or as Unser veer significant or
[1:30:49] insignificant as it may be whatever
[1:30:51] God's dealing with what have you failed
[1:30:53] it lately what have you been going
[1:30:55] through lady what are your trials themes
[1:30:56] been lately find out what that is
[1:30:59] because you see God wants to deal with
[1:31:02] it he's dealing with it don't go down
[1:31:06] that mountain another time yeah let it
[1:31:08] be dealt with there you might need
[1:31:11] deliverance and healing you might need
[1:31:14] counseling it depends on what it is it
[1:31:18] might just be a little insignificant
[1:31:19] thing but you see God wants to deal with
[1:31:21] it amen he wants to in those little
[1:31:24] things you might think of small but it
[1:31:25] could cause a major thing later on or it
[1:31:29] could be the the little link between
[1:31:32] major things in your life and he wants
[1:31:35] to deal with that first
[1:31:36] and then he'll deal with the major thing
[1:31:37] so you don't know we've just got to hold
[1:31:39] his hand they kept another host he's
[1:31:41] going to take us through the land so you
[1:31:45] might need deliverance healing because
[1:31:48] you see
[1:31:49] a demon might be in your life and I'm
[1:31:52] not saying you this is just hypothetical
[1:31:54] now that can be delivered but there
[1:31:57] could be scar there could be a real hurt
[1:31:58] that's happened a trauma because you
[1:32:01] know a way a devil can get into
[1:32:03] someone's life is through a traumatic
[1:32:05] experience a real traumatizing
[1:32:07] experience and they lose their mental
[1:32:09] faculty that go insane for a short
[1:32:11] period of time or whatever their walls
[1:32:13] break down and the demon comes in and
[1:32:16] but the thing is at that traumatic time
[1:32:20] a great breach or a great rupture can
[1:32:24] happen in the emotional realm and
[1:32:26] actually cause deep damage that needs to
[1:32:30] be healed and so yes deliverance needs
[1:32:34] to happen but then healing also needs to
[1:32:36] happen the person needs to actually
[1:32:38] relive the thing and talk about it and
[1:32:40] actually go through it with somebody and
[1:32:42] pray and actually get real supernatural
[1:32:46] healing from the issue from whatever it
[1:32:50] is that's that's why it's so important
[1:32:52] to diagnose and a lot of the stuff you
[1:32:54] know you need to do if the pastor
[1:32:56] especially if it's something that's
[1:32:58] quite serious you need to go through it
[1:33:00] with somebody because it actually can
[1:33:05] you don't just want to mess around and
[1:33:07] play Church with that sort of stuff
[1:33:09] that's quite serious but it you see
[1:33:11] those are the things can actually hold
[1:33:12] you back from receiving more of God as
[1:33:16] things in your life so that's why it but
[1:33:18] it's so good that you can actually find
[1:33:20] out what what God wants to deal with by
[1:33:22] the trials you're going through what has
[1:33:24] fingers on and what you're convicted
[1:33:26] about and what you're failing it deal
[1:33:30] with that now go into the battle prepare
[1:33:32] to finish stay with it don't just give
[1:33:35] up and think oh it's just not going to
[1:33:37] happen it will happen some things just
[1:33:39] take time and you really need to stick
[1:33:42] with it you never go into a battle
[1:33:43] unless you're prepared to win the battle
[1:33:46] amen
[1:33:47] you're mentally prepared now because all
[1:33:50] these things that we're going through
[1:33:51] here I'm not that these aren't overnight
[1:33:53] fixes these aren't even weekly fixes
[1:33:54] these are life style changes that can
[1:33:57] take months and months of going through
[1:34:01] and in on the other hand
[1:34:03] the supernatural God if you can put his
[1:34:06] finger or something and you can be
[1:34:07] healed instantly of it there is
[1:34:10] different ways that God can heal so
[1:34:14] don't ever rule anything out always just
[1:34:17] what with God and know what God is going
[1:34:19] to do and when you walk close with them
[1:34:21] you'll know apply the medicine is
[1:34:24] directed by the doctor amen amen and
[1:34:26] there's a certain way we're going to
[1:34:27] apply this there's a certain type of
[1:34:29] medicine that I'm talking about here and
[1:34:31] we'll show you what I'm talking about
[1:34:33] always rely on the power contained in
[1:34:36] the word you are speaking by faith not
[1:34:39] just by intellect yes put brother Browne
[1:34:42] and said take their thoughts and put
[1:34:44] them in your carnal mind your intellect
[1:34:46] because we want to put that intellect
[1:34:49] into its place don't we we don't want
[1:34:52] their intellect being a wild child
[1:34:53] that's unbalanced we want their
[1:34:56] intellect to actually be a happy
[1:34:58] intellect
[1:34:59] that's balanced and is actually happily
[1:35:01] dormant that's fresh so we can just take
[1:35:05] that you know a happily dormant because
[1:35:07] in Romans 6 it says here that is knowing
[1:35:11] this that your old man is crucified with
[1:35:13] Christ and just old man is destroyed
[1:35:17] that we're destroyed is not annihilated
[1:35:18] yet it's just dormant so their old
[1:35:22] nature by the grace of God by the power
[1:35:24] of God by the revelation of God actually
[1:35:26] gives you dominion to Rickon that old
[1:35:29] nature dormant so that it's dead is
[1:35:33] destroyed but it's actually not
[1:35:34] annihilated yet it's still there until
[1:35:38] you put off this old tabernacle but you
[1:35:41] can actually end but it can it can be
[1:35:45] happily balanced ly dormant amen
[1:35:48] so that the chemicals in your body come
[1:35:50] under the influence of God's thoughts
[1:35:53] that you've decided to think that you've
[1:35:55] chosen to think and the actions that
[1:35:58] you've chosen to do and the antidotes
[1:36:00] that you've chosen based on your faults
[1:36:03] so whatever faults that you diagnose in
[1:36:05] your life the issues you know find the
[1:36:08] antidote talk to a minister talk to a
[1:36:11] pastor about the antidote go through it
[1:36:13] together
[1:36:13] that's what it says confess your faults
[1:36:15] one to another because you need someone
[1:36:17] much
[1:36:17] actually why don't you do this let's
[1:36:19] pray and do that and this is the
[1:36:22] opposite stand they might have a
[1:36:23] testimony actually I did this and it
[1:36:25] worked
[1:36:26] it's what's so important now we're in an
[1:36:27] environment where we can this is not a
[1:36:30] place of where we're competing against
[1:36:32] each other we can confess our faults
[1:36:34] whatever no one's going to judge you
[1:36:35] they love you we all love each other
[1:36:37] it's so good
[1:36:38] amen always so remember they don't take
[1:36:44] it just it's always rice it always rely
[1:36:47] on the power contained in the word you
[1:36:49] are speaking by faith not just by
[1:36:53] intellect so one of them and now there's
[1:36:57] so many one of the issues that you might
[1:37:02] face and now this is all hypothetical
[1:37:03] so don't but if something does come up
[1:37:07] it might just bring to my memory
[1:37:10] something that you've gone through so
[1:37:13] some people have a difficulty believing
[1:37:15] every word and these are some of the
[1:37:17] things that can actually cause that lie
[1:37:19] to by parents always endured unfulfilled
[1:37:22] promises by parents or loved ones
[1:37:24] leaders churches these things mentally
[1:37:27] soil by Western education curriculum of
[1:37:29] unbelief and that's my that was me you
[1:37:33] just get taught stuff that's completely
[1:37:35] the opposite of the Bible but also I
[1:37:38] don't think I was lied to by parents
[1:37:40] really they didn't really need to lie to
[1:37:41] me because they just openly did
[1:37:43] everything they wanted to do always
[1:37:45] enjoyed unfulfilled promises my parents
[1:37:47] people this can actually cause people
[1:37:49] trouble now not everyone is built in the
[1:37:52] way with this you know some people
[1:37:53] everything that ever happened negative
[1:37:56] has been a big problem in their life and
[1:37:58] they've just never overcome it and they
[1:38:00] always remember they always speak about
[1:38:02] it and it's just and then there's some
[1:38:04] people that don't even remember it but
[1:38:06] yet it doesn't matter who you are there
[1:38:08] are some things that have affected you
[1:38:10] some things head now I'm glad you're
[1:38:15] sitting down so you don't fall off your
[1:38:16] seat because it's not too far but this
[1:38:18] is so simple the resolution for this I
[1:38:20] believe the Word of God with all my
[1:38:22] heart that's all you need to say that's
[1:38:25] all you need to confess I believe the
[1:38:28] Word of God with all my heart that's not
[1:38:29] some big fancy thing
[1:38:31] it's the most simple thing and this is
[1:38:33] how it's so exciting all the stuff you
[1:38:37] know maybe you have trouble when some
[1:38:38] people have trouble leaving the Word of
[1:38:40] God and a lot of our subconscious is
[1:38:42] already doubting you know because of all
[1:38:44] the false thoughts that have gone
[1:38:46] through
[1:38:47] 3550 16 whatever years of our life we've
[1:38:51] been negatively thinking all these
[1:38:53] things but now it's time to start
[1:38:55] changing it now it's time to start
[1:38:56] thinking actually I believe the Word of
[1:38:58] God with all my heart let that thought
[1:39:00] stay in your mind let that thought come
[1:39:02] out of your mouth when a doubt comes no
[1:39:05] I believe the Word of God with all my
[1:39:06] heart brother Branham asked that lady
[1:39:08] did you believe it with all your heart
[1:39:09] yeah that encapsulates the whole thing I
[1:39:12] believe the Word of God with all my
[1:39:14] heart
[1:39:14] amen say it just keep saying it you can
[1:39:17] say it now when vain repetition I looked
[1:39:21] at the supper because I didn't want to
[1:39:22] get start teaching vain repetitions a
[1:39:24] vain repetition is actually a repetition
[1:39:27] that has no value but there is actually
[1:39:29] a valuable repetition Jesus actually
[1:39:32] said you know you go to the you go to
[1:39:34] the unjust judge and you just keep going
[1:39:36] and you keep praying you be perseverant
[1:39:39] amen now and that was actually now he's
[1:39:42] talking when he talked about payment
[1:39:44] petitions he was talking about praying
[1:39:45] now this is not even praying this is
[1:39:47] actually a testimony your testimony is I
[1:39:51] believe the Word of God with all my
[1:39:52] heart
[1:39:52] and you can say that over and over if
[1:39:55] you like actually this brother Brennan
[1:39:57] said repeat them over because these
[1:39:59] people that have gone through these
[1:40:00] traumatic experiences that have been
[1:40:02] nervous and they've gone to their prayer
[1:40:03] line and they need to do that because
[1:40:05] they're getting hounded by that devil
[1:40:07] believe you me see that devil might not
[1:40:11] be able to harm them but he'll still try
[1:40:12] and he would have been that lady would
[1:40:14] have been bettered and that's what
[1:40:16] brother pam said just go rejoicing
[1:40:19] singing her giving her instruction no
[1:40:22] matter all the stuff and the fiery darts
[1:40:24] that gets fired at you for the next 10
[1:40:26] five months or years whatever that
[1:40:29] people try to get you back you just sing
[1:40:32] instead you start testifying a word
[1:40:34] instead and he said it you know get them
[1:40:36] into your carnal mind and repeat them
[1:40:39] over and over and so you know for me I
[1:40:41] before I go to sleep
[1:40:44] and I've got my little I know I've
[1:40:46] diagnosed my life and I know my things
[1:40:48] that are that are that in my troubles
[1:40:50] and so I've prescribed myself some
[1:40:53] medicine these are exact opposite of the
[1:40:57] things that I have in my life that are
[1:41:00] troublesome that I know there's probably
[1:41:02] many that I don't know but if you care
[1:41:04] to tell me please I'm all is so before I
[1:41:12] go to sleep and I pray and I meditate on
[1:41:15] the word I meditate on these things too
[1:41:17] and I think to myself and I say it I
[1:41:20] believe the Word of God with all my
[1:41:22] heart because you see my subconscious
[1:41:25] was programmed by the soiled by Western
[1:41:28] education and my parents were soiled by
[1:41:31] the same education so they taught that
[1:41:32] to me as a child
[1:41:33] so my upbringing in school everything
[1:41:35] was all unbelief and so I need this
[1:41:39] because yes I believe the Word of God
[1:41:42] with all my heart and I believe it I
[1:41:44] really do and I've seen it you cannot
[1:41:46] not believe it but that doesn't mean
[1:41:48] that downstairs that Cruz still needs to
[1:41:50] be retrained it still needs to be
[1:41:52] retrained and I but the good thing is
[1:41:54] that I'm at a point now and I've been
[1:41:56] doing this for quite a long time I can
[1:41:58] see the results and so if you are
[1:42:00] struggling not all of us struggle with
[1:42:02] this not all of us do some of us have
[1:42:05] been raised in faith raised by parents
[1:42:07] that taught faith some cultures like
[1:42:09] African cultures in that that they don't
[1:42:12] have unbelief like that Western culture
[1:42:13] does because everything spiritual and
[1:42:16] their supernatural going on in all
[1:42:17] religions and it's just open they don't
[1:42:20] have any trouble believing for miracles
[1:42:22] and believing for did being raised that
[1:42:24] all that sort of stuff because it's just
[1:42:25] normal that's actually just normal there
[1:42:28] there's no other way that's it you need
[1:42:31] to get healed you go to God or you go to
[1:42:33] the witch doctor whatever religion you
[1:42:35] go do and they go and get healed things
[1:42:37] actually happen there's not so they're
[1:42:38] raised like then they have been for
[1:42:40] hundreds of generations but over here
[1:42:42] there's a bit different you know and so
[1:42:43] for me I need to do that and I've
[1:42:46] actually seen it work and I've seen
[1:42:47] things happen in my life where now I
[1:42:50] pray and you know there's the more of an
[1:42:52] affinity going on between my conscious
[1:42:54] and subconscious now that doesn't mean
[1:42:57] to say that
[1:42:58] God can't change you supernaturally
[1:43:00] instantly and get your subcultures
[1:43:02] cleaned out he can if he decides to do
[1:43:05] it that way for you hallelujah and that
[1:43:08] does and with and if you find that your
[1:43:10] now I'm not dealing with the soul here
[1:43:13] because my soul believes the Word of God
[1:43:14] it does it is the Word of God you know
[1:43:18] you cannot not believe what you are
[1:43:20] because that's what you are
[1:43:22] amen so I am i clear do you understand
[1:43:25] you follow good I just want to make that
[1:43:29] real clear because I don't want anything
[1:43:30] y'all know Andy is now teaching about
[1:43:32] not believing the word anymore I believe
[1:43:35] the word and I believe it really
[1:43:37] strongly you know and I see it happening
[1:43:39] hallelujah but the subconscious now is
[1:43:42] actually starting to actually believe
[1:43:44] that and actually coming on board and
[1:43:46] what brother brems said the three are
[1:43:48] coming into alignment because I'm
[1:43:50] applying the doctors medicine spiritual
[1:43:53] medicine which is actually taking the
[1:43:55] thoughts of God into your carnal mind
[1:43:58] and repeating them over as the Prophet
[1:44:00] said and now I just put there I believe
[1:44:04] the message with all my heart which is
[1:44:06] the Bible anyway but I believe the
[1:44:07] message with all my heart
[1:44:08] amen some people fail to really connect
[1:44:12] with church family and maybe perhaps
[1:44:15] they're suffered rejection at school and
[1:44:17] have got all sorts of drawn up resent
[1:44:20] our reserve Minh cebause letting go of
[1:44:22] their affections towards people outside
[1:44:27] of their immediate family and some
[1:44:28] people even in extreme cases can't even
[1:44:31] connect with their immediate family and
[1:44:33] so it depends on how severe you've been
[1:44:36] in through a trauma in your life just to
[1:44:38] make you emotionally detached and and
[1:44:40] restricted from actually loving somebody
[1:44:42] because you're scared that you're going
[1:44:43] to be rejected maybe they've been
[1:44:46] ostracized from peer groups experience
[1:44:48] rejection when you opened up to people
[1:44:50] you know when you get to know someone a
[1:44:53] bit more and then all the sudden you
[1:44:54] feel a bit freer and you say something
[1:44:56] real stupid or you do something you like
[1:44:58] you just express yourself and they're
[1:44:59] like what an out of it go and then they
[1:45:02] they don't call you anymore you don't
[1:45:04] get the phone call to go hang out the
[1:45:05] next day here but weird
[1:45:08] ha I have an experience there by the way
[1:45:12] I have been through a lot of this those
[1:45:14] trust me yeah I have been through these
[1:45:16] things now but I I now parents always
[1:45:20] warned about trusting people outside the
[1:45:22] blood family you know sow seeds of fear
[1:45:25] into the children but the solution my
[1:45:30] church family loves and cares for me and
[1:45:32] I for them it's all you know I'm not
[1:45:34] saying you have to say this verbatim but
[1:45:36] if you find you're struggling with
[1:45:37] connecting with your church family there
[1:45:39] is medicine there is something that you
[1:45:42] can confess and you can say it you can
[1:45:45] believe it and say it by faith my church
[1:45:47] family loves and cares for me and I for
[1:45:50] them I am safe to trust and love my
[1:45:55] church family you can just say that and
[1:45:59] if you're struggling with that here you
[1:46:01] go say those things just say them
[1:46:04] believe them don't just say them in your
[1:46:05] intellect
[1:46:05] actually take them and believe them by
[1:46:07] faith they are these are actually these
[1:46:10] are God's thoughts there in the Bible
[1:46:12] there's a unity that he brings there's a
[1:46:14] love amongst rhythm that he brings so
[1:46:15] now I'm paraphrasing a theme in the
[1:46:18] Bible
[1:46:18] I'm encapsulating a biblical theme of
[1:46:21] love and unity and trust and being able
[1:46:25] to confess your faults one to another my
[1:46:27] church family loves and cares for me and
[1:46:29] I for them I am safe to love and trust
[1:46:34] my church family I am safe to open up my
[1:46:37] heart to my church family safe Alleluia
[1:46:41] my church family will not laugh at me
[1:46:43] when I start confessing my fault so amen
[1:46:46] they will not judge me Amen Alleluia now
[1:46:49] when you do these things and if you want
[1:46:51] to you want something you want to say
[1:46:54] something that's opposite or whatever
[1:46:56] never put it into the future of the past
[1:46:58] it is the present it has to be I am this
[1:47:01] or verse is this not this will be or I
[1:47:05] hope no it's not faith faith Caesar is a
[1:47:08] man that's what I'm talking about here
[1:47:10] these are statements of faith these are
[1:47:13] positive thoughts of then catch you
[1:47:17] later blue cool
[1:47:18] truth about you and then
[1:47:21] truth is not something out of you it's
[1:47:22] in you already Alleluia
[1:47:24] let's move fast because it's late
[1:47:26] struggling with the last thing after the
[1:47:28] opposite gender this is a big one this
[1:47:31] is a big one long association with this
[1:47:34] is some of the reasons why long
[1:47:36] association with ungodly lascivious
[1:47:38] people was not connected to parents
[1:47:41] emotionally or found connection
[1:47:44] elsewhere exposure to explicit material
[1:47:47] as a youth to soil their thinking and
[1:47:50] make them lust now there's a big subject
[1:47:54] on that whole thing that we know but
[1:47:56] this we're not going to go into it but
[1:47:59] the solution i have no pleasure nor
[1:48:02] comfort and lusting after woman so what
[1:48:04] you need to say now it might not happen
[1:48:06] overnight if you're mentally engrained
[1:48:09] in a certain way and you're thinking a
[1:48:10] certain way and you've allowed yourself
[1:48:11] to go and lust after woman for so many
[1:48:13] years or woman to lust after men and
[1:48:15] it's just become an ingrained part of
[1:48:17] your habit and your your way of life and
[1:48:19] you struggle with it you actually really
[1:48:22] are going to take time and you've got to
[1:48:24] discern and talk to the pastor to know
[1:48:26] whether it's a spirit because if it's a
[1:48:28] spirit that spirit needs to go first and
[1:48:30] then if there is things that's happened
[1:48:32] in your life that's you know and there
[1:48:35] might have been you know you weren't
[1:48:36] connected and you connected to something
[1:48:38] you've got to find out what that
[1:48:39] connection was and where it happened and
[1:48:41] where you went off and actually go
[1:48:43] through it with somebody and posture and
[1:48:45] pray about it and get healing from there
[1:48:47] and ask the Lord to take take that out
[1:48:49] of you and change those habits and go
[1:48:52] through it specifically and say I said I
[1:48:55] wasn't going to go into it but there is
[1:48:56] a way through these things now if it's
[1:48:59] just the habitual thing that you're
[1:49:01] struggling with and you've been dealt
[1:49:02] with and you've been prayed for and all
[1:49:04] those things and you know that you've
[1:49:05] been delivered if there ever was a
[1:49:06] spirit there then you there is a way out
[1:49:09] and that is actually changing what your
[1:49:12] subconscious has been programmed so long
[1:49:15] doing and that way is by taking that
[1:49:18] thought into your carnal mind and
[1:49:19] actually changing it and doing the
[1:49:21] opposite so here you're saying the
[1:49:24] opposite you're actually telling
[1:49:26] yourself now because what you tell
[1:49:28] yourself and the thoughts that you put
[1:49:30] down into your subconscious that
[1:49:31] faithfully believes everything you say
[1:49:34] and whether it's positive or negative
[1:49:36] whether it's a lie or the truth it's
[1:49:37] believing what you tell it so if you
[1:49:40] tell it I have no pleasure nor comfort
[1:49:42] and lusting after women or men if you're
[1:49:45] a woman
[1:49:46] it will believe that now I won't believe
[1:49:49] it straight away but it might take a
[1:49:51] long time
[1:49:52] it might take they actually did Studies
[1:49:54] on this stuff on what the on this
[1:49:56] because this is actually also in the
[1:49:58] medical field on how to overcome all
[1:50:01] sorts of things and they say it takes
[1:50:02] about three months I'm actually doing
[1:50:04] this everyday and everynight of actually
[1:50:07] saying these things and testifying them
[1:50:08] and declaring them it actually takes a
[1:50:10] long time for their subconscious to go
[1:50:12] click because the subconscious is
[1:50:15] designed so that it takes a bit of time
[1:50:17] for things to click otherwise everything
[1:50:20] will click and you just become swayed
[1:50:21] around by everything but it actually
[1:50:23] takes a bit of time is like it's a
[1:50:25] protection for you but also that
[1:50:27] protection works in a disfavor if you
[1:50:29] have negatively enforced thoughts on
[1:50:31] your subconscious for so long because it
[1:50:34] takes habits and you've got to form
[1:50:36] habits new habits and now you're telling
[1:50:38] yourself your subconscious here a truth
[1:50:42] that's based on a righteous life now
[1:50:46] brother Branham actually said in this
[1:50:48] subject he said that if you you need to
[1:50:52] run your life through a thinking man's
[1:50:54] filter now if you if you run your life
[1:51:03] through a worldly man's filter you will
[1:51:05] develop a worldly man's taste if you
[1:51:08] start and end therefore and if I bring
[1:51:11] it into this subject if you're walking
[1:51:13] through the city and every undressed
[1:51:15] female that walks around you you cannot
[1:51:17] stop looking and you keep looking and
[1:51:19] you turn around and then you look back
[1:51:21] again you're developing the world
[1:51:23] immense taste you're starting to develop
[1:51:25] habits that are going to lead you into a
[1:51:28] place which makes it very difficult for
[1:51:30] you to get out of it becomes very hard
[1:51:32] very very hard because you because it's
[1:51:36] enticing and these spirits attached to
[1:51:38] those people that wear those clothes and
[1:51:40] those spirits start to come on you and
[1:51:42] they start to affect you and they start
[1:51:44] to affect your emotions and they affect
[1:51:46] your whole life
[1:51:50] but on the opposite and this is so
[1:51:53] freedom free and you can make a
[1:51:55] conscious choice now it takes a bit of
[1:51:58] strength and a grace of God for you to
[1:52:02] make a conscious choice to do the
[1:52:03] opposite and actually say no I'm not
[1:52:05] going to look and even though your flesh
[1:52:08] is saying look look look look will you
[1:52:09] say no I'm going to look away and it's
[1:52:12] at first and maybe for the first month
[1:52:13] that's going to be a bit difficult but
[1:52:16] then after that brother Branham says
[1:52:19] that if you run your life through a holy
[1:52:21] men's taste you'll do a holy man filter
[1:52:24] you develop a holy man's taste and your
[1:52:28] spirit will start to desire to look away
[1:52:30] and you'll start to form new tracks in
[1:52:33] your mind and you're thinking that
[1:52:34] actually enjoy looking away and enjoy
[1:52:37] doing what is right and you start
[1:52:39] remembering the fellowship and it goes
[1:52:40] through your imagination your conscience
[1:52:42] your affection your reasoning and all
[1:52:45] your everything it goes through the
[1:52:46] whole lot and it starts retraining in
[1:52:49] all your thinking and everything all of
[1:52:50] a sudden that you're out of it you've
[1:52:52] developed a will a holy man's taste now
[1:52:55] on the other side of their action
[1:52:56] because that's doing it that's actually
[1:52:58] doing the antidote acting upon it you've
[1:53:00] you can also start telling yourself I
[1:53:04] actually don't like this because really
[1:53:06] you don't your soul hates it your soul
[1:53:10] hates unrighteousness your soul hates
[1:53:14] that your your conscious mind hated and
[1:53:16] it gets into a mess of turmoil if you're
[1:53:17] involved in this and I know firsthand
[1:53:19] because I've been and down this road
[1:53:21] very bad I wasn't the past that I had
[1:53:23] was very bad and so coming into
[1:53:25] Christianity it took a long time for me
[1:53:27] to get through all these things so I can
[1:53:29] preach this from a very strong
[1:53:30] experience and I know that these things
[1:53:33] here work I know that it works and not
[1:53:37] all of us struggle with us not all of us
[1:53:39] have this issue but many do any
[1:53:43] red-blooded male can fall into this trap
[1:53:45] I have no pleasure nor comfort and
[1:53:51] lusting after woman if you're married
[1:53:53] I am completely satisfied with my wife
[1:53:56] it's two-pronged approach actually
[1:53:59] there's a three pronged approach because
[1:54:01] either status Jesus is the source of my
[1:54:04] comfort these are things that you can to
[1:54:07] clear amen these are things that you can
[1:54:10] if you are in the middle of a storm then
[1:54:12] you'll stuff up with this and and the
[1:54:14] devil's trying to get you done down this
[1:54:16] track you could just stop and say no I'm
[1:54:18] looking away and I have no pleasure or
[1:54:20] comfort and lusting after women
[1:54:22] I hate unrighteousness I hate
[1:54:24] lasciviousness as David said I hate the
[1:54:26] work of them that turn aside so you can
[1:54:30] imagine you can see and and that's just
[1:54:33] some I'll just read out a few things
[1:54:36] here to you just so you get a more of a
[1:54:40] an idea and believe me is about is
[1:54:44] thousands of them that I've gone through
[1:54:47] but for now and for the purposes of
[1:54:50] being 930 we're not going to we're not
[1:54:54] going to go through it but you can
[1:54:56] declare these are some of the things you
[1:54:58] can declare I believe the Word of God
[1:55:00] with all my heart
[1:55:02] covetousness is unrighteousness my
[1:55:04] identity is in the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:55:07] what the Word says about me I'm an eagle
[1:55:09] and overcomer the bride I'm blessed

[1:56:37] growing in God's grace the spoken word
[1:56:39] is already within my mouth I have the
[1:56:41] blessing of Abraham in my life God
[1:56:43] speaks to me and I can hear him I am
[1:56:45] resting in the promises of God I have
[1:56:47] everything I need in Jesus Christ
[1:56:49] whatever I touch is blessed you start
[1:56:52] saying some of these things about
[1:56:54] yourself and eventually you'll really
[1:56:56] start believing them and when you really
[1:56:58] start all three you're lined up to
[1:56:59] believe those things your identity is
[1:57:01] very secure and you're going to
[1:57:03] recognize who you are and you're gonna
[1:57:05] leave hallelujah amen when the bride
