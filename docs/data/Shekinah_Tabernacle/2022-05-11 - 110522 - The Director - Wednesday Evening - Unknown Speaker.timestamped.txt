[26:14] you can take your seats because i i
[26:16] don't have an opening scripture i don't
[26:18] want to
[26:19] seem like i'm not spiritual but i have
[26:20] lots of scriptures i just don't have an
[26:22] opening one
[26:25] you know sometimes we do it just because
[26:27] you think we have to do it but
[26:29] we'll get to the scriptures eventually
[26:32] because you know we can say a lot of
[26:33] things but
[26:35] what we say
[26:38] could mean nothing it usually is but
[26:40] when we when what we say is
[26:42] is based on the word of god or is is the
[26:44] word of god then it's value you know
[26:46] it's eternal thank you musicians thank
[26:48] you davo
[26:50] good
[26:51] [Applause]
[26:55] i was um
[26:57] i told him i might share a little
[26:58] testimony before i start um
[27:01] and i said i don't know whether i'll do
[27:02] it or not but i will so i was standing
[27:05] about over here
[27:06] maybe
[27:08] six months ago when were you down south
[27:10] jenny
[27:12] when were you in christchurch
[27:14] a year ago wow was it
[27:16] oh well okay
[27:17] so
[27:18] so it was a year ago you know
[27:21] um
[27:22] david wasn't quite doing what he was
[27:24] doing today a year ago
[27:27] and um
[27:28] you know
[27:29] you try and raise your children in the
[27:30] fear and abolition of the lord and and
[27:33] you know you do the best you can you do
[27:35] do what you can but there comes a point
[27:36] where you understand that it's all in
[27:38] god's hands you know we we think we're
[27:40] pretty good and we can do listen to all
[27:41] that but you get to a point where you
[27:42] realize you can't i can't do much you
[27:44] know it's only by the grace of god
[27:46] it's only by his grace it doesn't matter
[27:49] you can take every parenting
[27:52] technique there is and read all the
[27:53] books to all the stuff you know it
[27:55] doesn't matter
[27:56] you know they're all good they all help
[27:57] here and there yes but you know for god
[28:00] to meet a man that's that's god's domain
[28:02] not ours you know
[28:03] and that's what
[28:05] that's what we as parents believe for is
[28:07] that god would meet our children not not
[28:10] we can teach them these things and they
[28:11] could become this and that you know
[28:13] that's what we know as value
[28:15] you know and we and that's something we
[28:17] can't teach we can't
[28:19] put in them we you know we do the best
[28:20] we can i understand but that's something
[28:22] we lay hold on by faith
[28:24] i believe that and we don't let that go
[28:27] that's one of the things that we don't
[28:28] let go we say no i'm not letting that go
[28:31] we can do that with the promises of god
[28:32] you can say no i'm not letting this go
[28:36] there are many things in life that i've
[28:38] i said lord you can take this take that
[28:39] do whatever you want with me throw me
[28:40] around do anything anything so you know
[28:43] kick me to the curb whatever you want
[28:45] but i want that
[28:46] when it came to my children i said i'm
[28:48] not budging on that i don't mean to be
[28:50] rude but i'm not budging that's it
[28:52] that's like that was one thing i said
[28:54] lord i'm just
[28:56] not moving
[28:57] not
[28:58] so and um
[29:00] you know but the devil gets at you when
[29:01] things don't appear like they're going
[29:03] as well as what they could you know
[29:04] maybe their son or daughter goes
[29:06] a different direction you know and the
[29:08] devil was i remember one
[29:10] week he was just playing at me all the
[29:12] time you know
[29:13] you can tell when the devils when it's
[29:14] the devil speaking to you because it's
[29:16] always opposite to what the promises of
[29:17] god are yeah he's always saying oh i
[29:19] know it's not going to happen because of
[29:20] this it's because you did that it's all
[29:21] these other things and it's not going to
[29:22] happen and no you just give up and all
[29:24] that it's always the opposite to what
[29:26] his promises that's how you know it's
[29:28] the devil because if it if it doesn't
[29:30] say amen to a promise of god then you
[29:31] know it's you know where it comes from
[29:33] you know you don't have to listen to it
[29:34] even though at times it might seem very
[29:37] convincing and very inviting to listen
[29:39] to we might even be in a bit of a downer
[29:40] mood so we kind of feel like i just want
[29:42] to embrace that because you'll just go
[29:43] down with that you know yeah that's the
[29:45] what happens right let's all be honest
[29:47] but don't go there
[29:49] and so
[29:50] i um
[29:52] but but i'm not saying the fight is easy
[29:54] because it's not easy we can stand up
[29:56] here and look back and say it but at the
[29:57] time it's hard we're not going to say
[29:59] it's easy
[30:00] you know standing on a promise of
[30:01] goldman it all looks bleak is not easy
[30:03] you can't tell me that jonah was in the
[30:04] belly of a whale just having a grand old
[30:06] time was the greatest thing that's ever
[30:07] happened to me i just can't believe it
[30:09] well what a blessed guy i am
[30:11] things weren't looking too good for him
[30:13] in that whale's belly and he couldn't
[30:15] really
[30:16] he didn't have a lot to smile about but
[30:17] he said god i believe if i look to your
[30:19] holy temple
[30:21] you know then he only had faith to look
[30:23] to
[30:23] and you know that's where god often gets
[30:25] us in the trial is we only have faith to
[30:27] look to because nothing else looks like
[30:28] it's going to happen like hezekiah when
[30:30] he looked out all he saw were armies all
[30:32] around him the soldiers and that
[30:34] there was nothing good going on for him
[30:35] at that point in time he only had faith
[30:36] to look to lord you're going to deliver
[30:39] me
[30:40] so
[30:41] so after weeks and weeks of this
[30:44] that they will let you at you at you
[30:47] and i thought you know what i'm gonna i
[30:49] think i'm gonna pen a song
[30:51] and i'm gonna deliver him my response
[30:53] you know when when you
[30:55] i can imagine two armies coming together
[30:57] you know one one army is
[30:59] saying what they're gonna do and they
[31:01] send out a they send out one of them in
[31:03] this they're um
[31:06] they're
[31:07] messengers to go see the other army and
[31:08] they say um you guys need to surrender
[31:10] otherwise this whole army is going to
[31:12] wipe you out and you know you can make
[31:14] you have terms of here's our terms of if
[31:15] you surrender to us this is what we'll
[31:17] do for you you know they try and make
[31:18] you surrender you know that's what
[31:19] devil's trying to do just give up
[31:21] surrender and he's at you you know
[31:23] and i like those i like those stories
[31:25] where the leader of the other army even
[31:27] though they might look like a ragtag
[31:29] bunch the leader of the other army says
[31:31] uh you go and tell the guy that sent you
[31:33] we'll never surrender
[31:34] we're never going to back down and we're
[31:36] coming after you so peter we'll give you
[31:38] the chance to run where you can
[31:39] otherwise we're going to wipe you out
[31:41] there might be only 100 of them against
[31:43] a thousand i don't care we're coming
[31:44] after you you're like why these guys
[31:46] look crazy when they're really gonna
[31:47] come
[31:48] you know but that's what a christian
[31:49] does in the face of all odds you just
[31:50] sign up i'm
[31:52] like like goliath and i was coming out
[31:54] bring me a man bring me a man all week
[31:57] he was saying oh for
[31:58] days and days months bring me a man
[32:00] bring me a man
[32:01] and then david said okay i'm here bring
[32:03] it on you know and then he delivered his
[32:06] response back i'm gonna your head's
[32:07] gonna be off you
[32:09] you know it's like you're gonna be done
[32:11] that was his response you know so i
[32:13] thought i'll pin this similar response
[32:15] so that
[32:16] i wrote a song that night sitting up
[32:18] here and then i came and sang it the
[32:19] next day i was that one no matter what i
[32:21] see no matter what i hear no matter what
[32:23] i feel i believe
[32:26] no matter what i'm told no matter how it
[32:27] seems no matter what it costs i believe
[32:30] and if i look and it seems like it's
[32:32] broken
[32:34] i'll lay a hallelujah on the altar and
[32:35] if i look and it seems like it's over
[32:37] hallelujah on the altar
[32:39] because he's a miracle working god
[32:41] you know
[32:42] and
[32:43] and
[32:44] i that
[32:46] you know things weren't looking good
[32:47] when that was pen but that's not what
[32:49] you look at you look at the promise it's
[32:50] gonna be all right he's a miracle
[32:52] working god i don't care how much it i
[32:53] don't care what it appears like so
[32:56] i just want to declare to you guys and
[32:59] confess to satan he's a miracle working
[33:01] god
[33:02] that's the god that we serve
[33:04] and
[33:06] this isn't limited this is everybody
[33:08] it's all the same we're all in the same
[33:10] terms there's there's no one that oh i
[33:12] can well he does it because he got this
[33:14] and that no no it's all the same terms
[33:16] we all just believe and god fulfills the
[33:18] same way there's no
[33:19] he doesn't have any little special i
[33:20] think i'll do it for him at all you
[33:21] haven't really been that good i won't do
[33:22] it for you it doesn't work like that we
[33:24] all come by faith it's the same it's
[33:26] exactly the same
[33:27] just sometimes god put some of us up we
[33:29] have to our ones have to play out in
[33:31] front of everyone you know to but maybe
[33:32] that's just to encourage you know to say
[33:35] look that's the god we believe
[33:37] i mean and i had hannah on the woods
[33:39] down there too so we had a it was good
[33:41] fun
[33:43] um
[33:44] okay
[33:47] i'm not gonna um i've got a little
[33:49] thought when i was trying to get
[33:50] something together nobody i've got to
[33:51] say what's this
[33:53] modern technology
[33:57] um
[33:58] so
[34:03] i just was i was wanting to talk about
[34:05] something quite simple tonight i just
[34:06] felt like i'll just do something nice
[34:08] and light and simple
[34:10] it's not really but because the things
[34:12] of god even though he might god may say
[34:14] simple things like oh so i went out to
[34:15] sew you know and he said just say the
[34:16] nazi you might appear like oh that's a
[34:18] children's story not actually a
[34:19] children's story when you think about it
[34:21] you could dwell on that for a long long
[34:22] time and the
[34:23] the the depth in that is phenomenal
[34:27] and yet he would just deliver a simple
[34:28] story so maybe this is one of those but
[34:29] um
[34:31] it's
[34:31] i but i did want to just make something
[34:33] quite quite simple tonight and it's
[34:37] i don't really even have a name for it i
[34:38] couldn't figure out what it was called
[34:40] but it's about god being a director a
[34:42] movie director in our lives
[34:44] being a director
[34:45] and and how god's creating something in
[34:47] each and when you're all part of a
[34:49] you're all part of a
[34:51] you're part of a movie you're part of
[34:52] god's movie god's a great movie maker
[34:54] and he's crafting this awesome movie
[34:56] that you're the star of it
[34:58] you like that eh
[35:02] and um
[35:03] but just to
[35:05] just before i before i get too carried
[35:07] away now the reason why i'm talking
[35:08] about this is because i i in the natural
[35:10] realm i do that so i understand movies i
[35:13] direct stuff but because i want to make
[35:15] the movie on brother brown after that i
[35:16] couldn't really care less you know i'm
[35:18] done with it
[35:20] but i just need to
[35:22] that say these few disclaimers like the
[35:24] trade in itself is a great trade like
[35:26] it's a very
[35:27] it's a very complex making a movie is
[35:30] those of us that do it to us it's just a
[35:31] trade you know we we do it we learn the
[35:33] skills we do this and that
[35:35] and it's a very complicated trade and
[35:37] it's a funny trade because people will
[35:38] do it
[35:40] directors will do it for a long time
[35:43] 30 40 years and still want to make
[35:45] another one
[35:47] and they've got all the money in the
[35:48] world they don't need to make another
[35:49] movie they need to make a single dollar
[35:51] more and you'll make another one
[35:53] you can't show me many people that are
[35:55] like a builder once the builders made
[35:57] his money man he's out i'm off the tools
[35:59] i'm done
[36:00] most trades right we as soon as you make
[36:02] enough money you're done but this is a
[36:04] it's such a complicated trade that
[36:06] there's just something about it that
[36:07] even though these people
[36:08] like the guy james we deal with you know
[36:10] he's he's he's a
[36:12] he's made movies he's one of the biggest
[36:14] directors in the world and he's he can
[36:16] sit back and do nothing the rest of his
[36:17] life doesn't need the work doesn't need
[36:18] nothing but he just he spends all this
[36:20] time making another movie because it's
[36:22] it's such a fascinating the art in
[36:24] itself is very complicated but
[36:28] it's one of those trades that's very
[36:29] powerful
[36:30] it has a very powerful aspect of it that
[36:32] can deliver a message
[36:34] so satan loves it because it's got an
[36:37] ability to deliver a message and he
[36:39] wants to deliver his message and there's
[36:41] only two main powerful trades as as in
[36:43] the world as movies and music are the
[36:45] two most powerful trades that that
[36:48] exists you talk you take someone that's
[36:50] a that's got the ability to make a movie
[36:52] i would suspect that there's going to be
[36:54] more demons hanging around him trying to
[36:56] have their little message out through
[36:58] him rather than someone that's i don't
[36:59] mean to say this this way but like
[37:01] you're in the front but if there's a
[37:02] builder
[37:04] he's going to try and work through a
[37:05] builder to get a message out it's
[37:06] probably going to have a reasonably hard
[37:08] time
[37:09] there isn't as much of an avenue
[37:11] so as a result of the power of this
[37:13] trade
[37:15] satan is all over it
[37:17] he's all over it like he now that
[37:19] doesn't mean to say everyone in the
[37:20] trade or evil people because there are
[37:21] there are many good people in there that
[37:23] genuinely might want to tell good
[37:24] stories and things but
[37:26] but i can assure you once they get along
[37:27] a bit satan is at them and he he wants
[37:29] to he wants that he wants that talent to
[37:31] use it and and
[37:33] and of course the more that
[37:35] because it's such a
[37:37] an ability there's an ability for that
[37:38] to make so much money
[37:40] the love of money is the
[37:42] root of all evil the love of money and
[37:44] these people that that run the movie
[37:46] studios have a love of money
[37:48] and they will just they don't care what
[37:50] story they tell as long as it's going to
[37:51] make money and so the morals and values
[37:54] go out the window because it's going to
[37:55] make us money we'll tell the story we'll
[37:57] tell that story that's why the new
[37:58] stories are anything progressive that's
[38:00] going to sell
[38:01] we'll tell that story and we'll promote
[38:03] that not because they believe in the
[38:04] story because they want to make money
[38:06] you see and then and then that's what
[38:08] that's the stories they want to make and
[38:09] they go out and try and find directors
[38:10] that want to make that because hey we've
[38:12] got the story we've got this money to
[38:13] put in it you want to make it then you
[38:15] make it
[38:16] now that movie director will just make
[38:17] it just because i'm getting paid
[38:19] he doesn't he probably doesn't care
[38:21] about it either in in that realm but you
[38:23] see the whole
[38:24] it's more the love of
[38:25] money that drives this whole thing um
[38:28] so i don't i'm not promoting the
[38:30] industry like it's a good industry
[38:31] because it's not
[38:32] on that
[38:33] on the whole of it it's one of the
[38:34] industries that satan's got hold of and
[38:36] that he he drives you know so
[38:39] i don't want to promote it like that
[38:41] um
[38:43] that's why is that a good disclaimer
[38:45] yeah you understand that good okay
[38:46] that's that's my
[38:48] that's that's that one right now i want
[38:50] to read some quotes from brother and
[38:51] before i and i'm just going to get into
[38:52] this
[38:54] this is brother i'm saying did you see
[38:56] uh cecil
[38:58] i don't know his last name the mills
[39:01] ten commandments he's saying the ten
[39:02] commandments the old one in the 50s 60s
[39:04] i guess many of you did i don't believe
[39:06] in going to picture shows all the stuff
[39:07] but i recommended
[39:09] to the church that anybody that if they
[39:11] didn't have nothing but that they wanted
[39:13] to see it it would be all right if they
[39:14] went to see it because
[39:16] i would not let um first some of my
[39:18] brethren went then they came telling me
[39:20] i hadn't been i hadn't been around
[39:22] one for many years
[39:24] finally i went down here
[39:26] when i was at this drive-in i looked at
[39:28] it i seen what it was i said to the
[39:30] church if you want to go see that it's
[39:31] all right there it was it was lovely
[39:33] beautiful so he went down and watched
[39:35] the ten commandments and he was taken
[39:37] back by what he saw he's got another
[39:39] quote here
[39:40] did you ever see cecil demille's ten
[39:42] commandments did you notice
[39:46] when the commandments was written how we
[39:47] caught it i didn't know there was two or
[39:50] three things that i seen in it i really
[39:52] liked first thing is that emerald light
[39:54] that's exactly what it looks like i
[39:56] thought that was quite good
[39:57] because he said i watched the movie then
[39:58] the emerald light that's what the pillar
[40:00] of fire looked like
[40:01] he said the pillar of fire that i see he
[40:03] looks to see
[40:04] so
[40:05] i think he actually
[40:06] um
[40:07] here's a picture of it here that he he
[40:09] described this scene here he said when
[40:10] the pillar of fire came and wrote the
[40:11] commandments he said and he said when it
[40:13] went away you see that's what it looks
[40:14] like when it comes in and goes out
[40:16] when i make the movie i'm going to use
[40:18] this as a reference because if brother
[40:19] ramsey this is what the pillar of fire
[40:20] looked like i'll tell the vfx guys make
[40:22] it look like that
[40:24] that's what he said it looks like man
[40:27] but now he also said this he said yes
[40:29] sir it's all moved up to us brother
[40:31] sister why is it
[40:32] in the last few years never has the
[40:34] movie world ever done what it's done on
[40:36] the screen comes the story of the ten
[40:38] commandments by cecil de mills on the
[40:40] screen comes the life of jesus christ
[40:42] through being here on the screen comes
[40:44] the life comes the big fisherman the
[40:46] conversion of peter and all these
[40:47] religious plays
[40:48] which the movies has refused and dirtied
[40:50] and thrown away but god and his mighty
[40:52] power blasted it forth just the same
[40:56] and there was a time they called it the
[40:57] golden age in the 60s where there was
[40:59] just these phenomenal movies being made
[41:01] massive blockbusters like
[41:03] and this is before vfx so these guys
[41:06] were building whole
[41:07] cities to film the stuff in
[41:09] um and a lot of them were these men here
[41:12] were doing it a lot of them were um
[41:14] christian based ones like um
[41:16] well this one here was the ten
[41:17] commandments and what brother brandon
[41:19] was saying was there was he said
[41:21] the the industry didn't want these
[41:22] because they're christian ones they were
[41:23] like no we don't want to make that stuff
[41:24] but they got made anyway and they were
[41:26] massive they were they were millions of
[41:28] dollars poured into these and they they
[41:29] made these and even the the brother um
[41:33] i think brother brown had a lot of time
[41:34] for cecil because he he said even before
[41:36] he showed this he had a viewing in his
[41:38] studio and he invited all the ministers
[41:39] around the country to go and watch this
[41:41] movie first the ten commandments and to
[41:42] critique it and let him know what they
[41:44] thought about it i think he genuinely
[41:46] wanted to promote
[41:47] god and through his trade
[41:49] of course the money takes over and now
[41:51] this won't have a market these days but
[41:52] back then
[41:54] and brother brown seemed to notice he
[41:55] said there seems to be this time where
[41:57] these ones are just all going forth the
[41:58] other one he mentioned was been her who
[42:00] seemed been here
[42:03] been her
[42:04] don't get me started on being her
[42:08] overcome being here after a while when i
[42:09] when
[42:10] she
[42:12] so he's in the scene i've got i've got a
[42:14] picture later on with the baddie you
[42:15] know he's in the scene
[42:18] and he has a run-in with us with um
[42:20] what's the bad guy's name
[42:24] masala yeah
[42:26] and then they they come to a
[42:27] disagreement on how they're going to
[42:28] deal with the jews in that and
[42:32] and masala says what's it going to be
[42:33] you know are you are you with me or
[42:35] against me
[42:36] and being here says if that's the only
[42:39] choice i have
[42:41] then i'm against you
[42:46] so that's always my response to shannon
[42:48] if we're at a disagreement where she
[42:49] wants to go to like
[42:52] a certain place to eat not i want to go
[42:53] there if that's the only choice i have
[42:56] then i'm against you
[43:00] so
[43:02] yeah man he's like he was a he actually
[43:06] he actually starred in both of these
[43:07] this was him there too
[43:09] he was massive in that time and
[43:11] and this was the other one brother
[43:12] brandon mentioned the big fisherman this
[43:14] was about the life of peter so there was
[43:16] a time in the 60s where a lot of these
[43:18] massive movies got made
[43:20] this was just something that i thought
[43:22] was interesting um
[43:24] was this one
[43:26] this was made by mel gibson which didn't
[43:28] really have much of an interest in the
[43:30] things of god as far as his his past
[43:32] history was concerned but for some
[43:33] reason he wanted to make this movie
[43:36] i think up to this point there were a
[43:37] lot of jesus movies but they weren't
[43:39] really
[43:41] they were made by churches they were
[43:42] pretty soft you know there was no they
[43:43] weren't really hard hitting like it
[43:45] would impact you it was pretty mellow
[43:47] stuff you know mellow little whips and
[43:48] that but i think he had a different
[43:50] vision to make it like let's tell it the
[43:52] way that it was
[43:54] i find one thing interesting about this
[43:56] i don't know whether it's true or not
[43:57] but we've got this modern thing
[43:59] happening today called cancel culture
[44:01] you know where as soon as someone
[44:02] uncovers something bad about even big
[44:04] stars oh no that guy did this he was a
[44:06] womanizer right let's cancel him and
[44:07] he's done right there there have been
[44:09] many many big names from the 80s and 90s
[44:11] that they look back and they think well
[44:12] that guy was a womanizer or something
[44:14] right let's cancel him and then he
[44:15] doesn't get any more work in the
[44:16] industry nothing he's cancelled
[44:18] been a good you know a lot of the times
[44:20] it's good because these guys were they
[44:22] had a
[44:22] when they you know when they had ability
[44:24] to
[44:26] choose they chose the wrong things and
[44:27] they
[44:28] kind of they read from what they saw and
[44:29] right but one person that
[44:32] the the
[44:33] the if you follow the stuff that the
[44:35] sort of movie world that people can't
[44:36] understand is why isn't mel gibson
[44:38] cancelled like he's done all these
[44:40] things but he just he's he's got this
[44:41] ability he just carries on he gets work
[44:43] he's just you can't you can't hurt him
[44:45] you just can't
[44:47] he the other guy's in the same league as
[44:49] some of a lot of them have been
[44:49] cancelled but people are this is the one
[44:51] person many people write about they say
[44:53] we don't know why but mel gibson just
[44:55] seems to he just has got this inability
[44:57] to be canceled although he should be why
[44:59] hasn't he been cancelled
[45:00] sometimes i wonder it's because he made
[45:02] something like this and he you know and
[45:04] it's like the lord said right you're
[45:05] gonna i'll just leave you to carry on
[45:06] then you can i don't know maybe maybe
[45:08] maybe not but
[45:09] but he made this movie just because he
[45:11] felt like he wanted to and i think it
[45:12] was a lot of it was on his own
[45:14] what
[45:15] money was you know his own investments
[45:17] in that but
[45:19] one one interesting thing was when he
[45:21] was talking to
[45:22] um mel when mel gibson was looking for
[45:24] an actor he looked to this guy jim
[45:27] cavazo
[45:28] kaveezel
[45:30] to play the part of jesus and but mel
[45:32] gibson warned me said you know if you
[45:34] take on this role that'll be the last
[45:35] you ever work in hollywood you know no
[45:36] one's going to want to touch you so he
[45:38] actually
[45:39] advised them off but he said no actually
[45:41] jim i like you're a great guy i don't
[45:42] want to ruin your career you know
[45:44] and jim said no no look i want to do
[45:46] this he and then he said look mal think
[45:48] about it my name my initials are jc and
[45:50] i'm 33 years old let me do this
[45:52] it was true
[45:54] so
[45:55] and even in that world i think this
[45:57] there's something sometimes in all this
[45:59] that god is god god does these these
[46:01] things
[46:02] so
[46:04] now
[46:07] as god is a great movie maker the first
[46:09] thing he needs is this first thing you
[46:10] need if you want to make a movie you
[46:11] need a good script you need a good
[46:12] script the problem that we have today is
[46:15] a lot of scripts that's so negative and
[46:17] down and boring you know but a good
[46:19] script has got a good happy ending like
[46:20] a story you know think of all the good
[46:22] stories they always have a happy ending
[46:24] a good story does does it
[46:27] you know you got a happy you don't want
[46:28] to you don't want to finish the story
[46:29] then this
[46:30] the good guy dies everything's bad and
[46:32] then you just left
[46:34] finishing your story and all of this
[46:36] you're worse off than when you came
[46:39] right
[46:41] you think of the greatest story ever
[46:43] told because there was a movie made of
[46:44] that too the greatest story of it all
[46:45] which was the gospel it's got a happy
[46:47] ending you know in all of jesus stories
[46:49] you've got happy endings now for the if
[46:50] you're on his side like you know david
[46:52] went out this man was coming against him
[46:54] but then david went out and he defeated
[46:56] him you know and they they won you know
[46:57] or
[46:59] or elijah there were all these men
[47:00] coming and then god the angels were
[47:01] around and then elijah was delivered or
[47:03] hezekiah was delivered or jesus came
[47:05] down and the romans they put him to
[47:07] death but then he rose again and now
[47:09] he's alive forever more you know we've
[47:10] got happy endings
[47:11] you know and
[47:13] that's those are the sort of stories
[47:14] that we're a part of you know our script
[47:16] of our
[47:17] if god's making a movie about you your
[47:19] script has a happy ending your script
[47:21] the good guy doesn't die in the end
[47:23] the good guy lives in the end you stay
[47:24] alive you you you make it through all
[47:26] the enemies the world around you but you
[47:28] make it out and you
[47:29] you just escape all the baddies and you
[47:31] make it through that's that's the sort
[47:32] of that's your story that's your script
[47:34] you know it's a
[47:35] and that that's the story that god has

[48:17] different you know we're all
[48:19] now in the
[48:20] in the visual world people like to see
[48:22] something with a bit of action they
[48:23] always marvel like they have these silly
[48:26] um police programs where they follow
[48:29] police around that arrest people you
[48:30] know
[48:31] now
[48:33] some guy is has i don't know ridden a
[48:35] bike on the wrong side of the road and
[48:37] oh we've got to arrest this guy running
[48:38] after him and tackling him to the ground
[48:40] and
[48:40] you know and
[48:41] strong in jail we know that but it makes
[48:43] for good viewing right because you're
[48:44] seeing the police run stop buddy and
[48:46] they're chasing after this guy and they
[48:48] tackle him and you know we're all glued
[48:49] to the screen watching where they're
[48:50] gonna get the baddie and they get him on
[48:52] the ground he tries to wrestle him and
[48:54] the other 10 cops come in and smash him
[48:56] and get him
[48:57] you know yeah i mean this guy might have
[48:59] stolen a lollipop from down the road you
[49:01] know
[49:02] you know but
[49:04] but it's viewing we're like well this is
[49:05] this is good viewing the viewer wants
[49:07] that
[49:08] they're a blue cot they're like white
[49:10] collar criminals out of stata in the
[49:11] process of stealing millions fleecing
[49:13] families up there the family will work
[49:16] and save up fifty thousand dollars for
[49:18] their retirement and they'll invest in
[49:19] some scheme by some
[49:21] cannot and lose it all their whole
[49:23] family's destroyed their financial
[49:25] life's destroyed they've got no way of
[49:26] making it all back up again
[49:28] but it's not good viewing they're
[49:29] knocking the door hey buddy we're going
[49:30] to reach you because you stole that
[49:31] money oh you caught me
[49:33] you know
[49:34] not good viewing he's done something far
[49:35] worse but
[49:37] you know we we
[49:38] we we like when you tackle the guy to
[49:40] the ground and boot him you know this is
[49:42] yeah catch them
[49:44] but
[49:45] i don't know why i said that but all of
[49:47] the
[49:47] but all of our stories are different
[49:49] right you got like your lives you know i
[49:52] i said that to to actually say like
[49:55] just because something looks like a
[49:56] small action it doesn't mean it's any
[49:57] better like like we like to hear stories
[50:00] oh this science went overseas and went
[50:01] on this big mission and went there and
[50:03] faced the raging
[50:04] seas here and there was you know
[50:06] attacked by robbers here and then there
[50:07] were there a wild beast got him over
[50:10] here you know and then we compare that
[50:11] to someone that maybe is just going to
[50:13] the job down the road and at work
[50:14] teaching somewhere and there and they
[50:15] are they look pretty boring you know but
[50:17] it's not it's just a different story
[50:19] like these ones one is a drama story
[50:21] one's an action one's a political one's
[50:23] a family story we all have different
[50:25] stories and god likes a variety of
[50:27] stories he doesn't want he
[50:28] you know he doesn't want to just sit
[50:29] down and watch a war story the whole
[50:31] time he wants a bit of drama maybe a bit
[50:33] of romance i don't know
[50:35] like he wants so so
[50:37] everybody you're all different you all
[50:39] have your different stories you know
[50:40] it's we and and they're all important
[50:42] they're all you know the god knows that
[50:44] the the viewer might think oh this one's
[50:46] a bit more important because they you
[50:48] know wrestle this guy to the ground but
[50:49] god knows their all of our stories are
[50:51] important
[50:53] now and
[50:54] the the when god is the story he has
[50:56] what you call a cast list you know in a
[50:58] film you get this okay who do we need we
[50:59] need all these characters and you get
[51:01] what you call a castle list so you've
[51:03] got to
[51:04] you've got to find out who you're going
[51:05] to cast for that
[51:07] and
[51:10] you don't cast people there like that
[51:13] you just cast people that are going to
[51:14] be a good right
[51:15] but there are there are many times where
[51:18] someone gets cast in a story to play a
[51:20] role that they they they are not that
[51:22] like like this guy here
[51:24] you know how many times you get
[51:26] this is this guy
[51:28] this guy
[51:29] is
[51:30] so that's that's the normal guy on the
[51:33] this guy bradley right he's like a quite
[51:35] a skinny like probably never
[51:37] never shot a gun in his life sort of guy
[51:39] you know like a you know wellington the
[51:41] people that grew up in the city that
[51:42] most of the people that come out of the
[51:43] acting school
[51:44] you know i run a mile from them which
[51:46] have none of the listing they're all the
[51:48] city folk never most have never seen the
[51:51] sun
[51:52] white skinny arms you know they're like
[51:55] you know
[51:56] just
[51:57] and then you you go to
[51:59] you you go to try and like i do a war
[52:01] film you know you need guys to play
[52:02] soldiers and you look at the crop that
[52:04] come in and apply for your role you're
[52:05] like oh man you guys don't look like
[52:07] soldiers you know you just you've got no
[52:09] veins in your arms or nothing man you've
[52:10] got to have like
[52:11] you know you're just
[52:12] you're all
[52:14] and you walk all
[52:15] you know
[52:16] soldiers like they their bodies are
[52:19] tough you know
[52:20] they're ready to go they when they move
[52:21] they quit you know their reactions but
[52:23] and maybe this guy was not that
[52:26] you know he doesn't
[52:28] out of film school out of acting school
[52:30] you know
[52:31] but but he gets the job so they say
[52:34] hey bradley your role is to play this
[52:36] this
[52:37] american sniper you know there's a guy
[52:40] that's a warrior from his youth you know
[52:42] so
[52:43] i mean
[52:44] he he had to beef up he ate 8 000
[52:46] calories a day apparently to just put on
[52:48] not fat but just bulk his body up you
[52:50] know and he he lifted weights
[52:52] and
[52:53] a lot of the stuff he did himself in the
[52:55] movie because he got he basically
[52:56] trained like a soldier and became a
[52:58] soldier to do that role
[53:00] now
[53:01] the reason why i'm telling you that
[53:03] is because it doesn't matter what you
[53:05] are yeah
[53:06] god says this is the role you're going
[53:08] to play
[53:09] right so in this situation he had david
[53:11] this little boy coming in
[53:13] uh he comes in and god says yeah this is
[53:14] the guy that i'm going to cast so little
[53:16] david comes in all like that your role
[53:19] is going to be i'm going to cast you as
[53:21] a king amen you won't look like much of
[53:23] a king it doesn't matter what you look
[53:25] like
[53:26] your role is to play the role of a king
[53:28] that's your role you're a king and he he
[53:31] went to gideon hiding away
[53:33] you know
[53:34] threatening his wheat to hide away from
[53:36] the enemy so it wouldn't get stolen uh
[53:38] get in i've gotta i'm just making this
[53:39] film and i'm gonna cast you as the main
[53:41] character in it
[53:43] oh really what am i going to play the
[53:45] guy that's
[53:46] you know hiding away threshing wheat
[53:48] nothing like that no no you're going to
[53:50] play the role of a mighty warrior that
[53:52] slays all the enemies
[53:54] me
[53:54] yeah you that's your role you're the
[53:57] you're the mighty warrior
[53:58] you're a powerful warrior i don't feel
[54:00] like one doesn't matter
[54:02] you're gonna act like one and you're
[54:04] gonna become one and in the film you are
[54:05] gonna be one
[54:06] now
[54:07] that's why they have this singing film
[54:09] called in character heard about in
[54:10] character or they call it method acting
[54:13] it's like
[54:14] it's where the characters
[54:15] when you have to play someone you study
[54:17] who is that person that i'm going to
[54:18] play then you study them and then you
[54:19] become so much like them that when you
[54:21] start filming you just act like them all
[54:23] the time you're in character so
[54:25] so if you're if you're like if i was
[54:27] playing an american
[54:29] and a film then all the time i talk
[54:31] american hey you know even when i'm at
[54:33] doing my coffee hey john how's it going
[54:36] i'm always american i don't just like
[54:37] talk okay we action now we actually oh
[54:39] hey john you know
[54:41] okay
[54:42] and all the all the americans are called
[54:44] john as well for some reason they're all
[54:45] john
[54:46] [Laughter]
[54:48] see
[54:51] you get in character and you you instead
[54:53] of just acting like the character you
[54:55] become the character and you just are
[54:57] always the character
[54:58] you always it right there's a reason why
[55:00] i'm saying this
[55:01] so this is daniel day-lewis he played
[55:03] the role of abraham lincoln
[55:05] and he studied that role for a year
[55:07] and
[55:09] and he he became so much like abraham
[55:11] lincoln that even when he when he was on
[55:13] set he never broke character he was
[55:15] everywhere he went he was abraham
[55:16] lincoln he talked like him so if you
[55:18] talk to if you would go up and ask him a
[55:19] question he's going to answer you like
[55:21] he's the president of the united states
[55:22] of america he spoke to you always like
[55:24] abraham lincoln all the time
[55:26] and
[55:27] you know the guys that do that they're
[55:29] the guys that get really good
[55:31] because they embody that's who i'm going
[55:32] to play then i'm going to be that person
[55:34] you know and
[55:35] god's got a role for us to play he says
[55:38] this is who you're going to be now we
[55:39] can be like a
[55:41] this guy won three academy awards by the
[55:43] way for his acting because i just read
[55:44] you this one i want to just i want this
[55:45] to sink in this is an important
[55:46] principle in god's movie making what he
[55:49] wants from us
[55:50] this is this is
[55:51] this is just in the natural but we can
[55:53] type this to the spiritual
[55:54] so with abraham lincoln it said he
[55:56] always spoke like him and the last of
[55:58] the mohicans when he played an indian
[56:00] warrior he learned to build a canoe and
[56:02] skin animals and just go out in the bush
[56:03] and then the boxer he learned to become
[56:04] a boxer so he wasn't just playing the
[56:06] role of a boxer he was a boxer
[56:08] right
[56:09] now
[56:11] you want to win an academy award in this
[56:12] in god's movie
[56:14] then then then don't just be like this
[56:17] little
[56:18] gideon guy here think lord if that's who
[56:20] you've maybe that's what i'm going to be
[56:22] lord i'm going to be there all the time
[56:24] um you know and the good actors when
[56:26] they they just become it all the time
[56:27] it's not like on sunday i'm i'm this
[56:29] mighty man of valor then on monday
[56:32] no monday i'm this mighty man of valor
[56:34] too i'm gonna i'm gonna stay in
[56:35] character all the time you know all the
[56:37] time i'm in character you know the good
[56:39] ones you want to win an academy award to
[56:40] stay in character because that's it
[56:42] shows that you mean business you know
[56:43] you're serious about this i'm not i'm
[56:45] serious about i'm not that person i'm
[56:47] not that okay
[56:48] yeah sure that might be me but no the
[56:50] lord said i'm this so i'm a man of faith
[56:53] i'm a woman of faith i'm not just this
[56:55] little that's what i was but that's not
[56:56] my character this is the character god
[56:58] wants me to play
[56:59] so
[57:00] then then we get on to the set you know
[57:02] we start we we do our we're gonna we're
[57:04] gonna start acting jenny knows all about
[57:06] this she was acting
[57:08] and the director yells action and then
[57:11] you stutter on your line like
[57:14] there's a term that
[57:15] in the film industry you have um
[57:18] yeah you have this what they call a um
[57:21] uh continuity person and they've got the
[57:23] script
[57:24] always they tell
[57:25] they're listening to make sure the
[57:26] actors say the right thing so those are
[57:27] the that's the person if you forget your
[57:29] line
[57:30] i've got a few actors that them they're
[57:32] most the line they use the most is line
[57:36] line you know what that means that means
[57:38] i forgot my line can you please tell me
[57:39] what my line is they go
[57:42] line
[57:43] and then the and then the
[57:46] um
[57:47] continuity person says
[57:48] hello my name is john thank you
[57:51] all right
[57:52] and then you do it again right there
[57:55] but
[57:56] when that happens
[57:58] it's a mistake
[58:00] it's not where the word mistake comes
[58:01] from but because mistake is an older
[58:03] word but it's uh because it's called a
[58:05] take then it's a mistake oh we made a
[58:07] mistake
[58:09] and
[58:11] sometimes when you're making a film you
[58:13] could go through 10
[58:15] 15 takes of the same scene to get it
[58:16] right
[58:17] you know like you do one take and they
[58:19] get it they get it wrong at the start
[58:21] then they go through a bit further and
[58:22] then they mess up but further it could
[58:23] be 15 20 takes to get this thing right
[58:25] it's called a mistake
[58:27] right
[58:28] i just want to show you that just out of
[58:30] interest have you seen ben who this is
[58:32] how they did it back then look at that
[58:34] like you'd never get away with that
[58:35] these days but they built these big
[58:37] they basically built that whole
[58:40] arena these are all people these are
[58:42] real things about and they strapped the
[58:43] camera onto some use in a way they went
[58:45] flying around there and the guys on the
[58:47] back you know videoing these horses
[58:49] but you would never get away with that
[58:51] these days you know it don't have to be
[58:52] over there's probably remotes and all
[58:53] cameras and you know
[58:55] but
[58:56] i wonder how many mistakes they made
[58:57] here
[58:59] but
[59:00] well the reason why i told you that is
[59:02] because
[59:03] we make a lot of mistakes
[59:05] sometimes our line might be lord i
[59:07] believe that you're gonna that you're
[59:08] gonna fulfill your word that's our line
[59:10] right this is your line you when you
[59:12] come up against the end and you say lord
[59:13] i believe you're gonna fulfill your word
[59:16] but we got to say a line and we say
[59:19] i just don't know if i can ah the
[59:20] director got that cut cut cut no that's
[59:22] not your line
[59:23] that's not your line let's reset you
[59:25] know we have this thing called reset
[59:27] means you go back to where you were all
[59:28] right let's let's give this another go
[59:31] picture this in your own life you know
[59:32] because this doesn't happen instantly
[59:33] but maybe one day you you're supposed to
[59:35] say that but you don't that's all right
[59:37] the lord said don't worry reset
[59:39] maybe the next week you come up against
[59:40] the same situation right action you come
[59:43] up against it you're supposed to say
[59:45] lord i believe in your word and
[59:46] we're going to overcome through your
[59:47] word
[59:48] you say lord i believe your word
[59:51] but i only usually
[59:53] just don't know i just don't know
[59:55] uh cut
[59:57] reset
[59:58] reset we're going to do this one again
[1:00:00] it was a mistake
[1:00:02] you know and god's a good director a
[1:00:03] good director just keeps on going
[1:00:05] and and what this guy's a director here
[1:00:07] saying okay and sometimes you've got to
[1:00:09] get the actors aside say hey come here
[1:00:10] come here look that's tough but you can
[1:00:12] do this man you've got this you can do
[1:00:13] it this is your line man this is you
[1:00:16] you you could just go out there and
[1:00:17] deliver it you i know you've got this
[1:00:19] you know that's what the lord does to us
[1:00:20] he we're going to deliver the perfect
[1:00:22] line
[1:00:23] we're going to be that we're going to be
[1:00:24] that actor he's not just going to say oh
[1:00:26] that'll do no we're going to go and
[1:00:27] deliver the line lord i believe in your
[1:00:29] word and i believe you're going to
[1:00:30] overcome we're going to deliver that
[1:00:31] line he's going to do heaps and heaps of
[1:00:32] takes till he gets the perfect line
[1:00:34] whether it takes weeks months and years
[1:00:36] he's going to keep on doing it till he
[1:00:37] gets the perfect line
[1:00:39] one of the other funny things in that is
[1:00:41] sometimes you're on set
[1:00:42] and you've got all the crew you know
[1:00:44] that this is a very very small crew you
[1:00:45] know a lot of sets here got like 30 40
[1:00:48] 50.
[1:00:50] and you know in this one here you've got
[1:00:51] probably that's probably the director
[1:00:53] here talking to the actors this camera
[1:00:55] operator the two boom operators you've
[1:00:57] got probably the
[1:00:58] the probably the first assistant
[1:00:59] director in the blue the the girl in the
[1:01:01] back there
[1:01:03] is
[1:01:04] she is probably that she's got the book
[1:01:06] she's probably the continuity person i'm
[1:01:07] not making sure they're saying the lines
[1:01:09] the person with the hair yellow here
[1:01:11] she's probably the focus puller so she's
[1:01:12] focusing the camera
[1:01:14] the
[1:01:16] the other two as the holder in film
[1:01:18] there's about
[1:01:19] 10 people working about 20 people
[1:01:21] standing around watching getting paid
[1:01:23] that's how the industry works
[1:01:25] but
[1:01:26] and and they'll get paid a premium
[1:01:28] dollar too and you've got to buy them
[1:01:28] lunch
[1:01:30] you believe that
[1:01:32] these guys get paid more than most
[1:01:34] people in the industry and you have to
[1:01:35] provide them lunch as well i it where's
[1:01:37] my lunch man and it can't just be a
[1:01:39] sandwich you know it's got to have a
[1:01:40] variety you could have like this that
[1:01:42] that
[1:01:43] see
[1:01:44] we we have that problem here because we
[1:01:46] we get all the contractors that have
[1:01:48] worked on like avatar and well we'll
[1:01:51] international movies that that hollywood
[1:01:54] are just pouring their money into so
[1:01:55] they get bought a nice lunch you know so
[1:01:56] we try and get these same contractors on
[1:01:58] our films they're like oh where's lunch
[1:02:00] that's lunch oh you got to be kidding me
[1:02:04] and they have they form a little
[1:02:05] committee you know and then there's a
[1:02:06] committee spokesman and they
[1:02:08] they they put forth their demands what
[1:02:10] they want for lunch you know and it's
[1:02:11] got to be a you know you've got to cater
[1:02:13] to the different dietary requirements
[1:02:14] some are gluten free some of this some
[1:02:16] of that man
[1:02:18] there but the reason why i wanted to
[1:02:20] point out the crew
[1:02:22] when you have to reset
[1:02:24] some of them like could reset
[1:02:26] like we might be filming you know and
[1:02:28] it's like three or four takes and i want
[1:02:29] to get another one i'm like
[1:02:31] okay i want to get one more of those i
[1:02:32] think the guy can do better sometimes
[1:02:34] the people like no one
[1:02:36] i'll think to myself hang on hang on you
[1:02:38] get paid bro what does it matter to you
[1:02:40] i could you wouldn't do this all day it
[1:02:42] means nothing to you this is costing me
[1:02:44] here i'd do another one it cost me i pay
[1:02:46] you to do this i pay all these people it
[1:02:48] costs me all this money why are you
[1:02:50] saying another one
[1:02:51] you just get back there reset and we're
[1:02:53] going to do this again you do this all
[1:02:54] day if we have to it's just the way it
[1:02:56] works
[1:02:57] now the reason why i said this because
[1:02:59] you know we got to watch out in the
[1:03:00] fellowship you know if someone's having
[1:03:02] a hard time and then they want to try
[1:03:04] again well we're never going to go
[1:03:05] through this again with this guy hang on
[1:03:06] hang on what does it matter to you
[1:03:08] what does it matter to you
[1:03:11] you get paid all the same
[1:03:13] our job will just go we're doing again
[1:03:14] yep let's do this again you've got this

[1:03:27] why why do we what are these guys saying
[1:03:29] we don't do it again
[1:03:31] but somewhat we just leave it
[1:03:33] don't get to take and move on how does
[1:03:34] that work
[1:03:36] a good director i'm going to get this
[1:03:37] tape we're not moving on
[1:03:39] sometimes we get to the end of the day
[1:03:41] and there's
[1:03:42] my first idea is telling me oh if we go
[1:03:45] from now on it's over time we're going
[1:03:47] to be paying thousands of dollars an
[1:03:48] hour
[1:03:49] and we've got to stop now i used to get
[1:03:51] so angry i'm like we're stopping we're
[1:03:53] getting this take i don't care if we
[1:03:54] have to pay 10 grand we're not packing
[1:03:57] up we can't make the film's gonna get
[1:03:59] the stake this is how it works you know
[1:04:02] god's gonna finish it off and we have to
[1:04:04] cooperate lord yeah we go okay we go
[1:04:06] again let's do it i've got all day you
[1:04:08] know our job is to serve when we serve
[1:04:11] in the in the kingdom of god if it's
[1:04:13] reuben's movie then i serve it was my
[1:04:15] movie he says me you know
[1:04:17] and and if there's dave's movie i serve
[1:04:18] him we all serve each other that's what
[1:04:20] we're here for you know
[1:04:21] are we going to reset with them let's go
[1:04:23] reset
[1:04:24] let's do this you know 10 years later
[1:04:26] still in the same scene i don't care
[1:04:28] let's do this you know that's the way
[1:04:29] that we work in the kingdom of god
[1:04:33] now as in all these films you always
[1:04:34] need a in film they call it an
[1:04:36] antagonist you know
[1:04:38] but that's because everyone tries to be
[1:04:40] like
[1:04:41] show their intelligent right who's the
[1:04:43] antagonist the protagonist you know that
[1:04:45] means
[1:04:46] why don't they just say goody and baddie
[1:04:50] you know honestly but people like to
[1:04:52] show their intelligence it's like a
[1:04:53] medical world they call everything greek
[1:04:55] names like come on man we speak english
[1:04:57] just call it a knee
[1:04:58] to call it some other greek name we
[1:05:00] don't speak greek man knee
[1:05:02] foot
[1:05:05] hey we try and we try and show our
[1:05:06] intelligence and yet we just that's why
[1:05:08] people like warren buffett so much as
[1:05:10] the
[1:05:11] you know the we used to be the richest
[1:05:13] man in the world because you've got the
[1:05:14] ability of explaining something really
[1:05:15] simple
[1:05:17] he's explained to people he says look
[1:05:19] if you bought a car young fellas he says
[1:05:21] if if i if you turn 18 i give you money
[1:05:23] to buy a car that he's trying to give a
[1:05:25] lesson on the young people look after
[1:05:26] their bodies right he says young people
[1:05:27] if you turn 18 i'm gonna buy you a car
[1:05:31] and i'll give you five thousand dollars
[1:05:32] to buy you know no no i'll buy you any
[1:05:34] car you want when you turn 18 i'll buy
[1:05:35] you any car you want you'll be like man
[1:05:37] this is awesome he's going to buy me any
[1:05:39] car i want then i say to you but the
[1:05:40] only catch is it's the only car you're
[1:05:42] ever going to have in your life
[1:05:44] you're like oh
[1:05:45] well i better get a good car b i'd
[1:05:47] better look after it that's what you're
[1:05:48] going to say it's the only car i'm ever
[1:05:50] going to have man i'm going to park this
[1:05:51] thing in the garage if i didn't tell you
[1:05:53] that you probably have to i'll get a bit
[1:05:54] slack park it outside this net if it
[1:05:56] gets run down i'll buy another one but
[1:05:57] i've said to you that's the only cave
[1:05:58] you're ever having
[1:06:00] chances are you look after today
[1:06:02] yeah man because it's the only one
[1:06:03] you've ever got he's like so it goes
[1:06:05] with your body it's the only one you get
[1:06:07] look after it you don't get another one
[1:06:09] you can't go and i'll just grab another
[1:06:10] one now if you break it you're done he's
[1:06:12] like guys are turning 40 and 50. their
[1:06:14] body's broken it's like man you ripped
[1:06:16] it
[1:06:16] you have looked after it man
[1:06:18] you know
[1:06:19] it's the only one you get
[1:06:20] i don't know why i said that but
[1:06:22] so the the
[1:06:24] here it is here look here's the scene
[1:06:25] here this is the goodies and the baddies
[1:06:27] you know this is masala if that's the
[1:06:29] only choice i have
[1:06:32] then i'm against you
[1:06:34] so
[1:06:36] and every good story in every good story
[1:06:38] there's got to be a goody and a baddie
[1:06:40] where all the goodies
[1:06:41] and the lord is what we call the goodie
[1:06:43] you know and
[1:06:45] but in every film
[1:06:46] and in every good script it has to be a
[1:06:48] baddie
[1:06:50] job there was a
[1:06:51] but you know the the thing with the
[1:06:53] thing with this is is that it's all
[1:06:54] scripted the baddie never can never ever
[1:06:56] ever get the goodie
[1:06:57] never
[1:07:00] his script is all you do is listen no
[1:07:02] more that's all you do you never ever
[1:07:04] get the goodie no matter how bad he is
[1:07:06] how much he wants to get the he wants to
[1:07:08] get the goodie it's like sorry man but
[1:07:10] when i read the script all you can do is
[1:07:13] this and that's what happened to job one
[1:07:15] time
[1:07:15] the lord said if you consider my servant
[1:07:17] job
[1:07:18] and satan's he's essentially saying yeah
[1:07:20] i haven't but if you let me adam he'll
[1:07:22] curse you he says no he won't but um
[1:07:24] okay
[1:07:25] you can do this to him that's all you
[1:07:27] can do i'll give you this piece here's
[1:07:28] your script here
[1:07:30] he says
[1:07:31] here's the next one
[1:07:33] and the lord said unto satan has thou
[1:07:34] considered my servant job there is none
[1:07:36] like him and all the earth are perfect
[1:07:37] and upright man one that feareth god and
[1:07:38] assureth evil
[1:07:40] and the lord said unto satan it's the
[1:07:41] lord said satan
[1:07:43] then said you know he only serves you
[1:07:45] because you bless them you've put a
[1:07:46] hedge of protection around him but then
[1:07:47] god said
[1:07:48] the lord said to satan behold all that
[1:07:50] he hath is in thy power only upon
[1:07:52] himself
[1:07:53] put not forth on hand so satan went
[1:07:55] forth from the presence of the lord
[1:07:57] so saying all right here's your script
[1:07:59] here's your script baddie you can do
[1:08:01] anything you want to his stuff just
[1:08:02] don't touch him and that was no matter
[1:08:04] how much satan wanted to mess with job's
[1:08:06] body he couldn't touch him sorry not in
[1:08:08] the script
[1:08:09] cut you want to try to go towards him
[1:08:11] cut
[1:08:12] back sorry that's that you cannot touch
[1:08:14] him
[1:08:15] now
[1:08:18] now god let him go a little bit further
[1:08:19] a little bit further he said okay he can
[1:08:20] touch his body but you're not having his
[1:08:22] life
[1:08:23] because see these baddies they're
[1:08:24] limited they in god's great script the
[1:08:27] baddies can't touch you
[1:08:29] they're only there to test you
[1:08:31] so they're just a tool in the see the
[1:08:33] baddie just makes the goodie
[1:08:35] gives a bit more spice to the story you
[1:08:37] know imagine there's no baddie you know
[1:08:38] no resistance
[1:08:40] he's just at all
[1:08:42] that's why brother adam says satan don't
[1:08:43] have one right or nothing he's only a
[1:08:44] bluff he was stripped of everything he
[1:08:46] had at calvary when jesus taken the
[1:08:48] sinner's place and died at calvary satan
[1:08:50] has no legal rights over nothing no more
[1:08:52] hallelujah
[1:08:54] or he cannot do anything to you he's
[1:08:56] just a
[1:08:57] has anyone seen pilgrim's progress or
[1:08:59] read this read the book that's that was
[1:09:01] the two lions right when he when he came
[1:09:03] in and they look really like these big
[1:09:05] bad lions but he realized you know if i
[1:09:06] just walk through the middle here
[1:09:07] they're actually chained up they can't
[1:09:08] touch me i just walk through
[1:09:10] it's all right you know
[1:09:12] the baddies in this script never get you
[1:09:15] don't matter what satan tries to say or
[1:09:16] how he's chosen to say he's going to win
[1:09:18] or nothing he never wins he the the
[1:09:20] baddie in this film never wins
[1:09:23] there's something else they have in
[1:09:24] films called a stunt double you know
[1:09:25] because all these you know the actors i
[1:09:27] talk about the skinny guys never
[1:09:30] you know
[1:09:31] they they jump and they break you know i
[1:09:33] shouldn't say
[1:09:34] i'm just so bad i hope no one ever sees
[1:09:36] this
[1:09:40] but
[1:09:41] they go to
[1:09:42] the actual reason why they don't why
[1:09:44] they get start doubles in in real life
[1:09:46] is because these actors are insured for
[1:09:48] millions of dollars you know you can't
[1:09:49] hurt them you can you get a scratch on
[1:09:51] them there's a lawsuit coming from their
[1:09:52] lawyers you know you scratched my guy
[1:09:54] you know so so when there's anything
[1:09:57] when there's a bigger scene that needs a
[1:09:58] bit of rough and tough action a bit
[1:09:59] dangerous then
[1:10:01] then comes the stunt double that's you
[1:10:02] know that comes in and these are that
[1:10:05] that
[1:10:06] go and
[1:10:07] do the stunt work that they don't want
[1:10:09] these guys to do because they don't want
[1:10:10] them to get hurt
[1:10:12] and maybe they can't do it some things
[1:10:14] the actual actor cannot do like man
[1:10:15] that's you want me to swing off that and
[1:10:18] do that jump there and then land on that
[1:10:20] man you know i know i'm trying to play
[1:10:22] the role as best i can but man i i can't
[1:10:24] do that
[1:10:25] i'm just i'm limited in my ability
[1:10:28] i'm limited in my human strength lord
[1:10:30] there's things i can't do i just lord
[1:10:32] i'm just gonna need you to take over in
[1:10:33] this situation lord you do this lord you
[1:10:36] know the lord's our stunt double you
[1:10:37] know when there's situations in our life
[1:10:38] where we just lord i just can't do this
[1:10:40] you know when you go through a situation
[1:10:41] you think lord how did i ever get
[1:10:43] through that yeah and it seems like the
[1:10:45] lord just comes in steps in and just
[1:10:46] thing suddenly it's all you make it
[1:10:48] through like well i don't know i don't
[1:10:49] know how i did that it's like the lord
[1:10:51] did it well he did
[1:10:53] there's times where he's our stunt
[1:10:54] double he comes in and he does it now
[1:10:56] people think it's us you know they when
[1:10:58] the film comes out man you did a good
[1:11:00] start there it's like it wasn't me man
[1:11:02] it wasn't me
[1:11:03] because you guys said
[1:11:05] sometimes you can't even tell who's who
[1:11:06] look these guys look which one's who's
[1:11:08] who
[1:11:09] which one's the tom i can't figure it
[1:11:10] out i think the guy on that side with
[1:11:12] the watch maybe he's wealthier but a
[1:11:13] watch
[1:11:15] i don't know who's who though
[1:11:17] but you know that's why you know when we
[1:11:19] when we become like christ it's hard to
[1:11:20] tell who's who about the lord when he
[1:11:21] steps in
[1:11:24] oh god i know i'm unworthy
[1:11:27] i'm weak my strength is gone but dear
[1:11:29] god thou art strong and i know
[1:11:31] that i'm unworthy but you are worthy and
[1:11:33] it isn't me after all and i'm so vile
[1:11:35] but in the light of calvary on perfect
[1:11:37] jesus made me that way by his grace you
[1:11:40] know he's our stunt double that you know
[1:11:41] and when we can't when we can't he can
[1:11:43] he steps in
[1:11:45] and and he does the things
[1:11:47] there's another concept in film which is
[1:11:49] very very popular these that's called
[1:11:50] vfx video effects where it means that
[1:11:52] puts some things that aren't there
[1:11:54] so later on the things get added
[1:11:57] it's it's almost disappointing to see
[1:11:59] like you think you know you
[1:12:02] it would almost be hard to act a reuben
[1:12:03] like if you if you're acting against
[1:12:05] that green screen and they tell you the
[1:12:07] director tells you reuben you're in this
[1:12:08] old setting with all these cars driving
[1:12:10] around you and you're sitting over there
[1:12:11] thinking man i can't see nothing
[1:12:13] you know you're like but then when the
[1:12:15] movie's finished they that's what
[1:12:17] actually you that's that's what was
[1:12:18] there the director's like no don't worry
[1:12:20] all this is there you just can't see it
[1:12:22] but it's all there
[1:12:24] often times in our life we think it's
[1:12:25] what we do is insignificant like i don't
[1:12:27] know i just turn up go to work it
[1:12:28] doesn't seem like much going on and that
[1:12:31] there's nothing like that in god's movie
[1:12:32] it's all significant there's so much
[1:12:34] more going on there then then there is
[1:12:36] nothing that's just average i can tell
[1:12:38] you that now when you wake up in the
[1:12:39] morning there's nothing average about
[1:12:40] your day nothing you might think it's
[1:12:42] like that up against the green screen a
[1:12:44] lot going on
[1:12:45] like like this guy you know oh this is
[1:12:47] average i'm just sitting in this basket
[1:12:50] no no that's not average there's a
[1:12:51] raging torrent around you and you're
[1:12:53] flying down in this basket down this
[1:12:54] river i am it doesn't feel like it feels
[1:12:56] like i'm just going along but when it's
[1:12:58] finished that's what it looks like
[1:13:00] you know none of our lives are
[1:13:01] insignificant and times i remember
[1:13:04] brother was it um
[1:13:06] i heard a story maybe it was at
[1:13:09] a testimony from the easter convention
[1:13:11] or something
[1:13:13] but someone was very sick a daughter was
[1:13:15] very sick and she she'd actually died
[1:13:17] and went away from her body do you
[1:13:18] remember that story
[1:13:20] who
[1:13:22] did brother andy say the story
[1:13:25] and remember they said that when the dad
[1:13:27] came in and prayed and when he spoke the
[1:13:29] name of jesus
[1:13:31] she said i saw this like power come into
[1:13:33] the room when he said jesus could you
[1:13:35] help he said pat that she said i saw
[1:13:36] just power come and then he would say
[1:13:38] some more things in but when he
[1:13:39] mentioned
[1:13:40] when he prays the name of jesus because
[1:13:42] the lord says he inhabits the praises of
[1:13:44] his people
[1:13:45] he couldn't see anything he would have
[1:13:46] just been sitting there maybe laying
[1:13:47] hands on his daughter lord jesus help
[1:13:49] you know
[1:13:50] nothing looked like was happening there
[1:13:52] was a lot happening in that room it's
[1:13:53] like this you know look maybe there's
[1:13:55] not much happening though these things
[1:13:56] happening all right there are big things
[1:13:57] happening you just can't see it
[1:13:59] there are massive things happening like
[1:14:00] this
[1:14:01] this you know it seems almost
[1:14:02] disappointing when you see what it what
[1:14:04] it is to what it was when it was you
[1:14:06] know but our movie is going to be epic
[1:14:08] of our life this i think you're going to

[1:15:09] we might think it's mundane but it's not
[1:15:11] this one i like the editing room
[1:15:14] i like the editing room it's a great
[1:15:16] place
[1:15:17] it's a great place for us
[1:15:19] there's a saying in film and it's
[1:15:20] probably translated to a lot of things
[1:15:22] that oh that's going to get left on the
[1:15:23] cutting room floor
[1:15:25] don't you like that
[1:15:28] you do a bad take you do a mistake you
[1:15:30] know oftentimes when we film
[1:15:32] i don't use that saying but i'll film
[1:15:33] and then it's a bad take i'm like that's
[1:15:34] the right i won't be using that one yeah
[1:15:36] it's going to get left on the cutting
[1:15:37] room floor never to be seen never to be
[1:15:40] heard never it's done away after that be
[1:15:41] put in the fire it's gone
[1:15:44] all of our mistakes we ever made
[1:15:46] everything
[1:15:47] all the bad takes all the mistakes
[1:15:49] everything like that
[1:15:50] when god goes into his editing room to
[1:15:52] edit it all together at the end
[1:15:54] he's only going to get all the good bits
[1:15:57] all the rest of the stuff every all the
[1:15:59] mistakes all the bad things are all
[1:16:00] going to get left on the cutting room
[1:16:01] floor gone
[1:16:03] they're not going to exist anymore he
[1:16:06] doesn't use those takes
[1:16:07] even if you did a hundred takes if
[1:16:09] there's one good one the 99 are gone
[1:16:12] no one's and and
[1:16:13] and the editors in control never can oh
[1:16:15] why don't you put this taken i don't
[1:16:17] want that
[1:16:18] take like this one then
[1:16:21] then i heard a loud voice in heaven
[1:16:22] saying now salvation and strength
[1:16:24] now salvation and strength in the
[1:16:26] kingdom of our god and the power of his
[1:16:28] christ have come for the accuser of our
[1:16:30] brethren who accuse them before our god
[1:16:31] day and night has been cast down
[1:16:34] you know the someone might come and say
[1:16:36] oh that guy was a terrible actor i saw
[1:16:37] him remember and that take he did that
[1:16:40] uh which one no this is the take here
[1:16:41] you mean this take oh that wasn't that
[1:16:43] one it was another one which one oh the
[1:16:45] other one oh this is the only one i've
[1:16:47] got of that scene this one here perfect
[1:16:48] take look at this perfect
[1:16:50] oh where's the other one don't matter
[1:16:52] where it is gone are we cut that out i'm
[1:16:54] not using that one
[1:16:55] when we ask god for forgiveness and it's
[1:16:57] under the blood is gone he cuts it out
[1:16:58] and it doesn't get used in the final
[1:17:00] take in our lives and the final cut it's
[1:17:03] just all the good stuff
[1:17:04] all the good takes all the perfect takes
[1:17:06] you know that's what he had us together
[1:17:07] not the
[1:17:08] no bad takes on this one it's all the
[1:17:10] perfect stuff that's why when he said of
[1:17:12] um
[1:17:13] people's often say you know the the new
[1:17:15] testament is the final take you know the
[1:17:17] old testament's all the the all the
[1:17:19] takes you know the new testaments where
[1:17:20] it's all been added together like like
[1:17:22] he said of god said of abraham he
[1:17:24] staggered not of the promises of god's
[1:17:26] unbelief did he stagger not
[1:17:28] well there were times where he staggered
[1:17:31] but not in the final cut he didn't
[1:17:32] stagger he was strong in faith and
[1:17:34] believed god when you see his life it
[1:17:35] was he was strong in faith
[1:17:37] even sarah says of sarah
[1:17:39] through faith also sarah received
[1:17:41] strength to conceive and was delivered
[1:17:43] over trial when she was past age because
[1:17:45] she judged them faithful who had
[1:17:46] promised is this the same sarah that
[1:17:48] laughed in one of the takes
[1:17:50] that take didn't get used that they got
[1:17:51] left on the cutting room floor
[1:17:53] the only type god used was the good take
[1:17:55] that's and
[1:17:57] when god makes our movie and it's school
[1:17:58] got the music and everything it's just a
[1:18:01] by his grace
[1:18:03] you're the hero of the story and you
[1:18:04] make it through
[1:18:06] and hey
[1:18:08] i think i think i can say that god likes
[1:18:10] a good story too you know he doesn't
[1:18:11] just like to sit back and be bored he
[1:18:13] likes a good story he likes it to be a
[1:18:14] bit of action a bit of
[1:18:16] a bit of suspense oh they're going to
[1:18:17] make it or they're not going to make it
[1:18:18] he even likes to show off to people you
[1:18:20] know oh look at that girl that oh it
[1:18:22] doesn't look like that guy's doing so
[1:18:24] well you know like the children of
[1:18:26] israel you know when they would sin and
[1:18:27] they would sort of seem like they're all
[1:18:28] going bad and everything's going
[1:18:30] downhill i think the enemies will sit
[1:18:32] back
[1:18:33] let's watch this story unfold you know
[1:18:36] and god would enjoy and and even they
[1:18:38] will be taken out to babylon and away
[1:18:40] but god's like don't worry there's a you
[1:18:42] haven't the script isn't finished yet as
[1:18:43] brother codra dixie to be continued
[1:18:45] there's more on the story at a certain
[1:18:47] point one of them is going to say god we
[1:18:49] want to call upon you again
[1:18:50] and then they're going to i'm going to
[1:18:52] start to move amongst them and they're
[1:18:53] going to start to rise back up and then
[1:18:55] they're going to get stronger and
[1:18:56] stronger they're going to overcome you
[1:18:57] that's in the script you know
[1:18:59] and
[1:19:00] oftentimes in our lives that happens you
