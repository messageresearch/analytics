blessed time um yeah I didn't touch anything yeah I was going to say then it didn't work but I wasn't I didn't touch anything before any stress levels go up um yeah but I want to thank you all for going to the rfbf camp in the convention in Stratford um God bless you um you know it says in Genesis 12 you know about Abraham he says I'll make thee a great nation I'll bless thee and thy name great and thou shall be a blessing so be blessed but will also be a blessing so thank you for going there and being a blessing to to everyone there I'd like to also thank brother Isaac brother upon Brother Andy for speaking while we're away um I gave Brother Andy Wednesday because I know when we'd come back so you're standing but I'll let you sit down soon um but yeah thank you for that maybe let's just read the scripture then we'll just um yeah let's just go to Luke 13. I know brother Andy's heard this a few times so we're just gonna go back again we had such a good time in Africa and as such if you ever get a chance to travel with Brother Andy urine for a great time I tell you what it was such a blessed time to travel with haven't we we just enjoyed ourselves enjoyed him enjoyed him enjoying Africa you know so praise God it was awesome so yeah it was such a blessed time um so Luke 13 and verse 10. and um so she's here um and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of um of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself and when Jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her Woman Thou Art loose from thine infirmity and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified God and the ruler of the synagogue arms him with indignation because that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the Sabbath day that just blows my mind amen let's just bowheads in the word of prayer he can have your seats gracious Lord we want to thank you Lord that you thought of us Above All you thought of me above all oh God one of eight billion people upon the Earth let yet Lord Jesus you thought of me thank you Lord we love you so much thank you dear God for this great privilege of being gathered with your redeemed Lord the purchase of your blood Lord which have gathered in this room I pray you'll touch each life Lord May bless every heart o God and Lord I just pray you'd also Lord those who maybe couldn't be here today their second body who couldn't travel I pray you'd be their portion father Lord we want to remember brother could be in sister Vanessa and the family as you're on holiday may give them a blessed rest away oh God and may bring them safely home to us Lord anyone else is still traveling Lord keep them keep them on the road dear God and father we've read a portion of your word but Lord we need you the great author Lord because it's you we need oh God you're the one we're looking for today oh God you're the one we're looking to see walk down and touch our hearts like only you can so may you do it for your glory Lord we invite you here Lord we invite you to every heart to every life today today God May touch each one we thank you for this coming year Lord all that you'll do in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seat so I get nervous if I leave people standing too long but yeah I'd like to thank them for all preaching um you know I liked uh you know his brother Isaac was saying you know we we do have a big group of young people coming forward um and I just you know the other take home thought I got from that is you know I don't want to be one of job's friends when a family goes sideways you know let's not be job's friends you know so criticizing and so on and but yeah but as long as everyone gets around the corner of going from a child to an adult but they know the grace of God I know they've got around the corner so it doesn't matter how well or bumpy whatever as long as they get round that's the main thing amen so I believe that so amen so and then also thank you to all those who have volunteered to be Sunday school teachers uh this year brother Armand and I are going to have a have another crisis session of planning how that works but there may be a big change because we've got a big group of people um and by them I haven't heard your service yet but I'm trusted it was a blessing but thank you very much amen so God bless you all love you there's no place like home it's good to see all your smiling faces amen praise praise the Lord So yeah thank you very much uh yeah so we're home praise God so happy New Year and um yes I'd like to speak on uh about formality today now formality comes in very many different forms but I just want to you it's amazing I just read the scripture in South Africa is interesting the things I wanted to preach on I didn't preach on the things I weren't weren't planning on preaching I preached on and I guess it's just how God works but you know it's amazing how you think about you I like to put myself in Bible stories who likes to put yourself in the gospels it's like you're there and everything goes on but it's amazing how you think about here here was a sister now she had she had this problem in her body for 18 years a spirit of infirmity had bound her that she could not even stand up straight about her over so you think about it that for 18 now who's younger than 18 here there's a few people younger than 18. so so this this woman had this problem where she was bowed over like this and she's coming to church maybe it was just about over the whole time and and for 18 years the church got used to her being in that condition and she became part of the service she they got people got used to her being in that condition now to me that really bothers me because you think they here were the here were the Believers of great Jehovah God you know they had the testimonies of Moses and Daniel and you know and David and you know Mighty Men and Caleb and Hannah and all the different testimonies down through the scripture and and you know the same God that that lived back then lived then you know but it was amazing they could get used to one of their own being bound by a spirit and to me this should bother us immensely you know when we see we should have such a love and a care and compassion for one another that you know it should drive us to prayer drive us to desperation the Lord would undertake for one another you know we should never ever look down on one another and say well they deserve it you know we all deserved hell be it the Lord Jesus interceded on our behalf he went to hell for you that you didn't need to go I say thank God for that amen I don't need to die a sinner because he died a sinner for me amen praise the Lord he took my sins upon his shoulders so we should never look down on one another when trouble strikes or when when a spirit comes in or something because you know we're all fighting this battle together you know this is not meant to be a Blue on Blue you know Friendly Fire kind of exercise but no our guns should be trained at the enemy and only at the enemy you know our criticism should be trained at the Devil you know all of our ill feeling whatever it shouldn't be at one another should be only at Satan and all of his devices right this is how we should be but it's amazing how she was in this condition 18 years it's a long time think about the just have a pause all right you know by the end he went through three interpreters in polokwati they couldn't keep up eventually the third one got there anyway praise a lot anyway praise God um yeah but but here she was for 18 years you think about that service after service should come in the front door bound she'd walk outbound you know service after service camp meeting after camp meeting Fellowship lunch after Fellowship lunch 30th birthday after 30th birthday 40th birthday after 40th birthday special meeting after special meeting should come in and go out the same way now we know God has a time and seasons for everyone right you know everyone God has a time and season to loose everyone now I I I I personally believe that that we're living in this season where the bride of Christ is no longer bound that God is here to loose us of all trouble of every Spirit of Affliction wherever it may be now I want to talk more about about spiritual being bound spiritually because we can be bound physically but if we're loose spiritually God can still work for us in a powerful way you know and you know and and sure physical binding oh God is here to heal but you know someone can come and bow and service after service and if we're not careful it can just become something we get used to instead of us interceding and praying that God in a season will will touch them and because remember God has no other voice on the earth lips but your lips he has no other hands but your hands no other feet but your feet no other heart but your heart no other mind but to use your mind right so God is depending upon you and I to call upon him that he can come upon the scene for for one another so yeah that's amazing because there came a day when when the very Jehovah God they claim to believe in walked in the church Messiah stepped in this was more than a prophet a more than a holy man more than just a Man from Nazareth but here was here was the Messiah the very the very one they are looking for the very hopes and consolation of Israel walked in the door and it's amazing because whenever he steps into the presence of his children and his children are hurting and they need a touch they need a hand he calls them to his side I mean I believe that's what the word does he doesn't just push us away you know if we're hurting if we're struggling if we're in pain God doesn't leave us in that condition amen but he comes and searches and finds us to gathers to himself as the grace of God I mean when when she could not lose herself he came to loose her and I'm I'm so thankful that the power of God nothing can conquer him amen he is the unconquerable one amen he is the mighty Victorious one so then she had said that he called her amen called her to him and said Woman Thou Art loose of thine infirmity amen and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified God now you think the whole church would just erupt you know it would just be a praise break and God would just fall and you know the anointing would just touch everyone and it would just be a four or five hour meeting of just saying hallelujah but you know you'd think that right because here's your sister that's had this trouble been bound but yet she's yet she's persevered She's Come Faithfully to the house of God she's still a Believer she hasn't thrown her faith away but her faith has held of those 18 years she's been overcoming even in the bondage she's still Victorious but then the Messiah comes and touches her loses her you think the whole place would just erupt but the chief priest in the Pharisees and so on they said with indignation this is out of church order this is not how we do things around here this is not the day for this to happen this is not part of our program it's not part of our church service hey around here we just have three songs 45 minutes preaching then another song then we go out that's our order right no one says that Pete this is how it should be but you know Messiah walked in you know so it's amazing how people can get into a form of worship but yet they can miss the very God who steps on the seat and people can get upset when someone gets blessed I get happy when someone gets Bliss you know we watch some of the camp videos and things we saw people shouting rejoicing I thought man praise God lord pour and more touch more of them Hallelujah bless everyone more Lord Jesus it just makes me happy when God touches someone Hallelujah all right man brother Ben price other than the testimony on the scene 1962 he says you're still God you're still Jesus the Risen one we thank thee for these they're standing here they're your children there there's only one thing they can do is come and confess they're wrong and that he will confess his sins Shall Have Mercy he that hides his sin shall not Prosper you said so God and pray God that you'll break up the old cold formal spirit that tries to hold this revival in captivity that we will take it over in the name of the Lord Jesus and break the powers of Satan by the gospel of the resurrection and the presence of Jesus Christ in this dark evil hour so the your God yeah yeah the devil doesn't want us to to break into Revival he wants to hold a Revival captive to to to limit its influence limits it its effect limits it limit its power but I believe the Lord is here to break that cold formal Spirit now I'm going to go into formality because some people think being quite formal but it's not some people think dancing is not formal but it can be you see so we're going to get into that so don't just you know but you see you see but there's a spirit that wants to hold back a real heartfelt Revival in the word amen God wants us in Revival he wants us to be rejoicing and to be happy and to be thankful and you know just just appreciate him and love him more remember he can't love us anymore he showed his the fullness of his love that day on Calvary right he manifested his love to you that day on Calvary and he's told you that he loves you right and that is that is enough right he said so and he is a god of his word so I can rest in the fact he loves me amen amen and we also know his love because he has called you right his love is is an elective love it's not like a parent that you know parental care lovers like we want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap you know and keep them from all danger right who's who kind of parents are like that what's wrong with you parents you know what I mean you don't want your kids to run out on the street and maybe there's a truck and hey have some fun no you want to protect them right you don't want them for pancake you want them alive but you see God doesn't like that God allows us to go through trouble allows us to go through trials but his love is not shown in keeping us from trouble his love has shown in his election and his calling right he may allow you to go through trials remember he'll take you through the trial remember he is our great Shepherd he's not a Shepherd like New Zealand with dogs and quad bikes and sticks and whistles driving sheep he doesn't drive us he leads us so he steps into the trial before you ever get there Hallelujah and he doesn't leave you there he leads you all the way through you've got to remember that there's an end to every trial remember the devil has an expiry date every trial has an expiry date and when there's no more trials no more devil no more trouble we shall still be because we will be Eternal in the heavens glorifying God and all of that will just be an afterthought Hallelujah I mean I believe that dear you know normally normally yeah normally stuff in the fridge you throw away you kind of oh man I want him to eat that but the you know what I mean but you know I've never been happy yeah anyway we'll leave that one but you know the devil the clothes has expiry date gets the happier I get this guy's gonna not be thrown in the bin but in a lake of fire and he's not going to mold up my fridge no more not mold up my life he's gone praise a lot Hallelujah so we can Rejoice so so I pray that God would break up the old cold formal spirit that tries to hold the Revival in captivity maybe because God cannot be bound amen he will refuse us to be bound I believe his children refuse to be bound amen we refuse to be bound by culture or by criticism or by trouble or just our skin color whatever it is we refuse to be bound you know I was you know one of the last Services yeah everyone was dancing in the church in polokwanean I couldn't get through the Ark of all the sisters of dancing all the brothers around the pulpit so I could have snuck out the side and go around I start dancing with them and you know and then and then the song later got up the next morning says man I've never seen a white man dance like an African I thought praise God I must have some Rhythm somewhere but but then I said I didn't you know but I'm not a white man I'm a Christian I'm a Christian that's why I dance because I'm a Christian right so you know I just wanted to get rid of any kind of any any kind of you know we had a ball down walls eh I don't like walls well it should be just demolished and take out the foundation let's just Plum get rid of all that stuff Amen to the great people of God can rally together around him praise the Lord amen but you see we live in perilous times right we live in perilous times as it would say in second Timothy the Apostle Paul would say in the last days perilous times should come then he lists many troubles that would happen but he'd say that people would have a form of godliness because remember I mean normally people will read second Timothy we won't read the whole thing but you know your list being unthankful to Parents Without affection all those things be able to oh that's unbelievers but then it comes to he comes down to verse five he says having a form of godliness but denying the power of the thereof from such Eternal waste there'll be people upon the Earth that will have a form of godliness but they'll deny the power thereof so they'll be Christians now whenever I speak about these things like brother John Andy said at the camp you know we used to people we used to preach about come out of denomination and that's all wrong and blast those things and you know and in that few Generations ago people came out of the nomination they came out of systems but most of us didn't come out of those things we were raised in the truth so what's the point of saying we're free of that when we're well we're born free what do you mean you know so so when I look at these scriptures I always try and apply it to myself and not someone out there because the Bible you know we're going to bring it on home right so when it says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof I don't put it out outside in some other church I said this this Spirit can come into the ranks of the believer because remember we're not immune from anything right just because you met God you don't get a free pass right actually the battle gets harder because the devil because you have something the devil wants but you can't give it to them because you've already given your life to the Lord right the reason he fights you is because he wants your life but you won't give him your life because you've given your life to the Lord hallelujah so so he fights you amen then then sure yeah but so it's expected but you've got to realize the one in you has already overcome whatever trial whatever Spirit whatever's come against you he has already overcome it the one in you so it's like brother Brahm says you know just say you got cancer you really have cancer some people just try and deny everything that's not overcoming brother and says when you recognize the enemy but also recognize the one in you has already conquered him that is overcoming Hallelujah so we don't bear it we're not a bunch of ostriches eh no we're Eagles right we don't bear our head in the sand we fly in the heavens right when the storm comes we go above the storm we don't bear our heads in the sand amen so sure trouble may be there you may be having the greatest trial of your life but there's one greater than the trail and he's with you in the trial he wants to show himself in the trail Hallelujah so we can have such you know I'm so glad being a Christian who's happy to be a believer doesn't matter what comes or goes we can say praise God anyhow holy that our Lord is in control he's greater than everything all the world he's greater than it all he's in control of this world over the devil's the king of this world yeah but who's who allows the devil to do certain things like the devil would come before God about job and and you know God would tell uh the enemy you can come this far but you can't cross this line so the first line was you can't touch him you can do what he wants just don't touch him amen and then so the devil pushed as hard as he could but he couldn't cross the line and he said well you know you can touch his body but he can't take his life he took him to the eighth degree but he couldn't take his life what God sets boundaries for Satan Hallelujah you know we're contending with a defeated foe we're contending with a limited foe he can't cross God's command he wants to he thinks he's in control no no he's just allowed to do certain things so we should never despair at this world we should say praise God God you're in control and even in this chaos we can walk as overcome as Victorious Hallelujah aren't you glad you know people walk around sad and you know empty but we can walk around rejoicing amen and happy and say Lord I think brother Tesla put a status on WhatsApp a while ago he said Lord may I live such a life people will easily find you I thought that is such a powerful I said Lord may that be me that I that you live in my life in such a way Lord that people easily find you when they come into my presence amen because because we have what the world needs the world doesn't need more zeros in the bank right it doesn't need less interest rates it does it needs the Lord Jesus Christ amen because all those things they'll fail eventually but he can never fail Hallelujah is having a form of godliness now this this word form it means a a a a a a a a shaping it means the mere form a semblance it means the you know it's the it's the outward form it's a structure but it's not it's the you know it's not actually the real thing it's like when you put boxing for you know brother Albert puts a boxing for um you know foundations there's a form is it called a form yeah there we go that one you know but you see it's not the it's not the foundation it's just a you know it's you know it's just the boxing whatever it's the outside and we can have the we can have the form just right so we can so so the outward form we can have the dress just right we can quote the word just right we can believe just right we can be baptized right never put a foot wrong when it comes to anything but that's just the outward four that's not that's not the real thing that's just the outward form so we can have a form of godliness even even among Believers amen we can be we can even dance around the church and I'm all for dancing you know being brother Andy's saying man we need more space up here this is this ain't gonna work no more praise a lot but you see formality comes not if you're quiet or if you're loud but formality is if your heart is not in it if there's not a heartfelt religion then it's just a form see because a form can just be where you conform to what your culture dictates to you right so so so here well we're well I don't know who it is but so apparently some people are conservative I don't I don't I don't that's not me I can't put myself there or maybe this color but I'm not that I'm a Christian right but but some people think well it's Godly to be formal and quiet and and reverent you know and then people fit into that and they say well they've really got it praise God they're a real believer but they can just be conforming to a culture and then it's the same thing you know you know even in Africa everyone dances around but it can just be a form there's people there dancing who really know God and they're having a rejoicing time but there's people dancing because everyone else is dancing just like here people are quiet they can be rejoicing tear run down their cheek and they can be having the greatest moment ever in the presence of God you know brother Brahman deep calls the Deep there's a man standing in front of him in the prayer line he's just standing like a bit of stone brother says no I can see you're excited he said he doesn't look excited but what brother Brown was saying is this man's excited because his life is being discerned by the angel of God rights you can never really tell on the outside really what God is doing on the inside sure what is inside does come out eventually but you know someone can be shouting and jumping amen and jumping on the chairs but no life and it can just be a form of godliness right or someone can be sitting there quiet and just say well actually and some people say well that person's got nothing but that could be God could be living in their life in a powerful way you know that the very God of heaven lives in that person in such a powerful way but you say well that person's just formal are they see we gotta we're gonna break formality even here we're a bit loud or what I don't know but you know people can just conform yeah to the church or go to another church they change to that church they just conform to that church we shouldn't conform to a church right we should worship God how we feel led to worship God because remember if the Holy Ghost is leading you it's never out of order right it's never out of order you may be like the priest you're criticizing that woman for being loosed and shouting and glorifying God but she was right in order why because Messiah touched your life Messiah changed her life she was no longer bound by that Spirit but she stood upright and glorified God and I believe when the blood of Jesus Christ touches someone amen bound down by a sin by complexes pains and hurts the law can touch that person they stand upright they say that thing won't bow me down no more amen it's under my feet the Lord has conquered I am free Hallelujah I believe we have something to Rejoice about amen this morning Hallelujah in this 2023 we can praise God I mean why because he is loosedus I mean this message is a this message is not a bunch of rules and bind people down if you've got that idea about our Lord you haven't met him I mean you've just made a message culture that is wrong I mean no this message is the most liberating message that's ever struck the earth I mean that we're not bound by Church culture not bound by religion not bound by Creeds or anything of man or culture whatever we are loosed in the Holy Ghost that we can walk with God like he wants us to walk with him look he walked with God then one day he just took a step further and went from this world to the next and it's like you and I the Lord wants us to walk with him I mean he wants us to walk with him in his word amen that we have a relationship when we read his word it touches our lives and when we hear the message it touches Our Lives I mean when we pray to him it's not some cold formal ritual but it's a heartfelt prayer now you may be emotional or not but you'll know when God touches you hey man you can be very expressive that's fine you can be quiet that's fine but when God touches your heart I mean that's when you're no longer formal why because God is dealing God is working hallelujah amen and that is the most blessed thing that's what brother Braham said the end of the church age book this one thing he wanted to established was a true relationship with God and man that's what he wanted that was the summation of that church age because that's what he wanted to see amen and that's what we want to see that everyone here would have a true relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ they wouldn't just know about him they would know him amen and in the good times they would know him in the good and on the hard times they would know him in every moment of Life trouble sometimes they would depend upon him that's what he wants Hallelujah I'm so glad our God is Not Just up in heaven someplace amen but he's a living God that's present Among Us amen and not just in these four walls I mean but in our everyday life Hallelujah I mean we can turn our Help Cometh From The Lord hallelujah I'm so thankful that we have a guy aren't you glad Hallelujah I'm simple I just get happy about simple things I just get happy I met him you know he found me hallelujah hallelujah praise God you know some people are afraid of what the Holy Ghost might might cause them to do yeah you know you might speak in tongues you might not you might shout a cry or dance or you might not but are you willing to let the Lord live through you that's why a lot of people are afraid of the new birth is because they're afraid of what God might have them do but are you willing to let God do it Hallelujah that's how we should be because if we're not willing to let God live it because it becomes a form amen it's you know we don't want to just have a form of godliness but we want the character of the Lord Jesus Christ the word living in US amen a real heartfelt religion Hallelujah because formality is manifested by not allowing or letting the Lord change our lives amen because of our hearts are soft towards him we want him to meet us and speak to us that's a heartfelt religion God connects on that level I mean not in our heads you know a lot of people they want to learn the message or they want to learn the Bible this is not some I praise God not a university it's not some trade school you've got to sit some exams praise God hallelujah I sat in a lot of exam times I'm so thankful I'm not here setting exams I'm so thankful this is not some calculus or some chemistry lecture and you've got to absorb some teaching and then try and regurgitate it later and those that regurgitated well they've really got it no they just remembered something no it's when the Holy Ghost comes and changes the life amen that our character becomes like his character that is the most important thing amen see people are afraid of fanaticism but I say if the Holy Ghost is anointing you he will never lead you into fanaticism he will keep you in the middle of the road right he will keep you in reality not going into fanaticism he will keep you in his word Hallelujah see no he says here then doesn't Jehovah Jireh he says now that's about the way our church is gone it just took in a bunch of under cold formal profession some Mystic dance or some sensation what do they do just believe the word till they got a nest full of rotten eggs it's time to clean the nest and start over again I mean until they're in contact with the male Christ Jesus get born again of the word then they got to hatch because it's life so you're saying that people can have some kind of a dance or some sensation but that's not Etsy it's got to be a heartfelt religion where you've surrendered to the word of God Amen then that breaks all formality because you're not just coming to church just like you know that you know that you know that uh Rabbi or whatever he wanted his his synagogue just to be a formal thing we come in well this day we read these these certain pages from the Torah and we go out and we come back and we go out that's what the devil wants we come in we go out nothing happens God doesn't do nothing you know we just go through a form of religion nice songs better motivational talking and then we go out but God's not looking for that kind of a church amen but that's what that's the kind of church the devil's looking for but God wants a people our sons and daughters of him full of a spirit where everyone is part of the spiritual worship see it's not just not just an anointed preacher and then the people are trying to grasp things but the people are just as anointed as the preachers we are we are all just anointed as a song leader or the musicians we're all Anointed with the Holy Ghost we're all here to be partakers of the same Holy Ghost worship Hallelujah that's why we're here right I ain't meant to worship Him in spirit and in truth this is our portion this is your inheritance oh look it's better than uh I don't know a new house so this is your inheritance to worship Him in spirit and in truth Hallelujah he says here in as a message Abraham he says now he says the Pentecostal church is getting cold and formal going right back into the depths of organization and then he says and as long as we belong to the church that's all that's necessary so it's linking organization with Justice Just this Mantra or the slogan while we belong to the church that's all we need we got a more than this there's no membership here any church I know in this country there's no membership if there's any membership I'm gone I resign see you later goodbye but see there's a mentality comes in well I'm in the message what does that even mean you know I'm in Stokes Valley what is that you know what does that mean here I am but and you know I'm in the message A lot of people are in the message but are you is the message in you is Jesus Christ the word in you see that's the thing see we we never get into heaven by association right we're not going into Rapture because we come to this building this is not you don't go through that door now you now your raps are ready because you come no this is not how this works well you know him it doesn't matter where you go you're ready you know people are asking me about is this age long or short how long's the lady in church age gonna be I just say well as long as the people are in the Holy Ghost they are ready if they go by the way I don't actually care how long the ages as long as I'm ready if I go by the way the grave I'm ready because it did in Christ's race first if I'm alive and remain well I'm ready doesn't matter if I'm asleep or if I'm awake whenever the Rapture happens I could be snoring my head off but I'll wake up in Glory Hallelujah why because he has made me ready right and that's the main thing amen it's not about dates and ages and times whatever no no are you ready do you have your token in your heart do you have the Holy Ghost in your life if you do then you are Rapture Ready everything you have needle for life's journey is within you the prophecy the Rapture is within you if you have the Holy Ghost what a Blessed Assurance we have I mean we can be so relaxed not lacks but relaxed it's big difference Lex says you don't care you just float along in life but if you're if you're relaxed you can rest in God I believe we can do that Hallelujah well you're just so bound down and eternal security absolutely I believe in eternal security I believe the Lord did not save me to lose me right he saved me to keep me he come to seek and save that which was lost so I was in his in his mind I was found but I was born into the Earth I was born last he came to find me Hallelujah so I can have full Assurance maybe I'm just too far on that limb but I well I I don't think so because I believe our God is a god of stability he doesn't make us guessing and troubled and worried am I going to make it am I not no he wants to eradicate that question out of your heart he wants you to know that you're going that you've actually if you've got the Holy Ghost it's as good as if you're already there why because you are sealed to the day of your destination amen you're sealed to that time right so you know we got our ticket in our hand praise God now if you think on those things all formality should go away because remember the our our enemy does not want us to have a heartfelt religion and he wants us just to cabbage down and just get this idea well as long as we belong to church that's all we need well our kids are raising the message and you know we've applied the token it's all they've got to meet God they have to have their own experience and I believe it's their right to have a holy ghost Revival a powerful Holy Ghost revolve we are so bless you Melanie and Christine were singing she'll kill me later but you know you know those two started a Revival in Tauranga by prayer they pray take God moving our church when I see you live and the Lord spoke said I'm gonna move Hallelujah and God put his Spirit out and he also said I'll cause some to come and some to leave that's exactly what happened right the power of God moved just two two young people praying in a bedroom had a burden for God to live see their siblings meet God in the church everything and what happened that happened yes yeah Hallelujah and I believe every generation has a right my children have a right to see God move in their lives to see the power of God where they come and start testifying to me Daddy I was praying we're praying in our room and God came down yeah try and wake them up the morning why are you so tired well we had a prayer meeting last night God just came down and I don't know what time it was we're shouting and praising that would just bless my heart Hallelujah I'd say no I want some of that Hallelujah can I can I come in and join you that's what I would love to see because every generation deserves a Revival they deserve to see God alive hallelujah amen that's how I feel so we should live in such a way Lord may we not be a stumbling block to our own children because remember they said us at our best and at our worst they do and they see everything in between God help us so you know may we may we not get in their way Hallelujah amen but we can't have this mentality well just as long as our children church and you know they're in the message that no they have to have their own personal experience we all must know him personally remember we're not we no one will get in by association it's only by knowing him they're going in a rapture amen so it's absolutely important you know let's see now it's amazing if we go to Matthew 21 I I like it when Jesus goes to church he causes he causes trouble some love it some don't love it Hallelujah so now he's coming to the temple this is Matthew 21 verse 12. so Jesus goes into the temple now you can put it up or not that's fine you know he goes to the temple and you see immediately he begins to rearrange everything see man had changed the temple from a place of a house of prayer to where God comes on the scene to a money-making religious system it had just boiled down to three songs 45 minutes one song at the end that's all we do now if people do that that's fine but if you just keep it as a full stop that's it you know you can't be rigid right you've got to let God move amen Amy you got to get you let the Holy Ghost move in a service right that's what we want all right yeah I trust that's what you're looking for that's what I look for why are you away from the supernatural God is Supernatural this message is Supernatural the word is Supernatural amen so we should see God move Hallelujah so so remember the temple was a place where where where uh where Isaiah would come and see see the vision of God high and lifted up and God would commission him to go and be a prophet and you know Hannah would pray there you know when it was just a Tabernacle in the wilderness and she would get a prophet son you know there are many powerful things would happen there you know they'd go and pray they'd call upon God because the enemies were all around and God would anoint someone and speak and tell them what to do but you see it had become because over time tradition had crept in and and and and the fire of Revival had gone out see we must never let the fire of Revival go out see some people say well every Revival will just be three years well that may be someone else's experience but I I'm not claiming that for me Hallelujah well it's been three years it's all over now just no who says who said that has to be that way can't we have a rejoicing heartfelt love of God see him live every day of our life brother Graham said a man can be drunk on the spirit every day of his life till he leaves this Earth Hallelujah now to me that's not just pie in the sky I believe that's we can have that do you want it are you addicted that bad that you've got to have another drink oh my your whole life is just just just molded around I've got to get the bottle I've got to get the bottle I've got to have another drink Hallelujah praise God hallelujah there's underage drinking allowed in this place by the way well it's not just for adults amen it's for everyone praise God hallelujah amen but you see they had turned it into this kind of just yo yo yo all they were interested in in selling sacrifices and and you know but but there was still a form of godliness they still come according to the word they offered the right sacrifices according to the word the Levites were the Levites all those things they you know but it turned into just a form of worship and then the Lord comes in and he gets rid of the thing that the people are holding in the highest esteem which is making money out of the sacrifices because he always attacks that religious spirit right on the head right so so he goes and he kicks all that out and you see it says that see my house shall be called a House of Prayer or the House of Prayer now when you think about prayer prayer is not just us speaking into the ceiling or us kneeling on a you know speaking down into the ground no prayer is communion with God Paris communion with God you know I you know I put the brother and he made the poster for one of our camps and I put it out the front door where it says that God how we thank you we can speak to you we're so thankful to be on speaking terms the blood of Jesus Christ puts us in this condition see it's not us that puts us in that condition but his blood puts us in condition to speak to him amen it's not us that does it it's his blood that has done it so you know brother Braham says that someone who just gets saved right then has more Authority with God in heaven than an archangel that never fell so here you are you've stumbled in darkness you've been bound with sin unbelief and Gabriel's there Michael's they're the archangels they're talking to God but then you surrender your life to the Lord you give your life to him and then you start talking to him they have to be quiet because he says my son or my daughter's talking to me and it was just a second ago they gave their lives to Lord he tells them to be quiet for you to speak to him yeah Hallelujah How Great Is Our God he's more interested in your voice than the archangel's voices that never fell your voice your prayer Hallelujah so prayers prayer is a communion right so that you call on God who's that answered prayer before hallelujah what is that you talk to God and then God supernaturally did something back according to your prayer see prayer wasn't just a form but it was but it it is fellowship with God prayer is to change our minds to match his mind right prayer is to intercede for one another prayer is the one of the most powerful weapons ever placed in your hand not just in the preacher's hand and everyone's hand you can be a little child you know I often remind you know I tell it quite a lot around you know because there's a five and a half year gap between Gabriella and William now tell the story how Annelise came to us and said well we want a baby and and she said well what do you mean she said well we voted three against two where's our baby I said well it didn't work that way yeah it doesn't work that way and she and she looked at me with that serious face she has and says and says well we're gonna go pray six-year-old girl or I know what age seven there he is but that was prayer prayer had to change my heart prayer had to bring life a life-giving prayer little little girls praying for life life came Hallelujah so praise powerful right never ever diminish your prayers no God wants to hear you talk to him he knows all about it but he wants you to tell him how you're feeling what you're going through what you're facing what help whatever it is even just if you can't think of anything to pray just just tell him how much he means to you yeah then you'll start having a prayer meeting Hallelujah so they were people were praying people still would have been praying there even though you know it turned into a den of Thieves you know it says that the you know it says that the um blind and the lame came to him in the temple so they would have been sitting there they would have still been there they didn't just turn up because Jesus turned up they were already there praying but they turned into a den of Thieves now that what had become a cold formal way of worship but then when Messiah when our lord Jesus stepped into that Temple he began to rearrange it to how it should be and then and then they blind and the lame came to him because they couldn't get any help from the priest but they came to the one who the priests were claiming to worship and then he healed them and then a real Ruckus begin to happen because it says in all the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did now you think that there'd be just an eruption from everyone from the top to the bottom and then the children were crying in the temple saying Hosanna to the son of David so so now the young people started getting vocal where once they were sitting quiet and not understood then they began to praise God why because the Messiah walked into church Hallelujah and they began to praise God so you know never ever dampen a young person when they get a bit happy we should encourage that we should encourage it never say well if you're a Christian you shouldn't do this no no no no encourage them and the Lord if they sing a special praise God where's Debbie where's Debbie she sang at the camp that was the most blessed special I ever heard of that whole meeting God bless you and I mean that I was I heard that song I was crying like praise God that blessed me that really did see we should always encourage our young people when they sing when they do anything for God hallelujah so they're crying and praising God the children were and all the scribes and chief priests they saw these things they were so displeased they weren't happy about it they're saying this is out of order where's the contact order Doctrine book this is not right this is not how we do things why what happened is because when the Lord came into the temple he came to restore a heartfelt praise a heartfelt religion not a formality but these ones these ones were so bound up and rituals they were not happy with what he was doing now what are we going oh boy okay you see man made the house of God into a money-making ritual form but it was a house it should have been a house of prayer and deliverance and then you know and then and then the scribes and Pharisees said to the Lord don't you hear what these ones are saying and Jesus said unto them yea but haven't you read out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise so here was a response to what God had done in their midst and it was a perfect praise out of the young people's lives I say praise God this is how it should be amen that that really because remember church is in a way it's generational but it shouldn't be generational it shouldn't be the old people and the young people and there's the young people here's the like it's some big golf no we're all brothers and sisters by the way we're actually all the same age in God Amen We're All in This Together amen because remember in eternity they're going to be the same age as you you're going to be the same age as them amen so we should always pull up our children put everyone around and say let's rally let's rally around the Lord and worship and praise him Hallelujah amen see they didn't like that going on see now where Jesus is always normally a lot of noise then Jesus came and called you know because when God comes on the scene how could it not bring forth a praise how can it not bring forth a heartfelt religion right but now if people just join in because others are doing it that's a form to them see it's got to be an individual on the heart to God praising the Lord I'm just repeating this because you know we don't want to get formal in any way Hallelujah we always want to have a heartfelt remember but the devil doesn't want us to have a heartfelt religion he wants us to be bound by by pain or misunderstandings or hurt you know or or are falling out with a brother or a sister or hard times in the fact you know we are always going to have hard times right but remember I come to church to worship God I don't come to church to worship my hard times right I don't give my hard times place we should we should come to church to worship God not our hard week or a hard month or whatever's going on no no our worship should be dictated to by our revelation of what he's done right sir so so if you're feeling like you've cooled off go back to what he did for you go back into your testimony and they're going to draw out those memories you know like you go look at photos or videos from holidays and stuff and then it brings you back into that place brings you back that feeling and the you know the atmosphere and you know you know the emotion that's why it's so important take your testimony out from the Shelf and bring it into the present day that's why God always reminded Israel remember what God remember what he did for you with Moses and Joshua and all the ones down Through the Ages he's the same God today and it should be the same thing with you and I remember where he found you remember where he found you the state you're in maybe the place you're living remember where he found you but remember when he found you he didn't leave you there he called you to himself you may be imbound by a lot of things maybe outwardly you look the part but inwardly you are not the part you're just the form but when the Lord saw you he said I don't want to leave you like that that is not your inheritance I did not die on Calvary if you just to have a form I'd Die that you would have me in reality and then he came your way maybe you're in church maybe wherever you were but he found you there he was looking he knew that that woman was in that synagogue just like in you with a woman at the well was he knew and he knew where you were he knew where I was and then he came your way Hallelujah he came your way and he touched your life you couldn't Lose Yourself no doubt that woman would have been for that 18 years so you know tried to push yourself up try and move again but that Spirit kept her bound down she made me cry at saying Lord why has this happened to me but in God's season he came her away because that did not stop her being a believer that did not stop her being a Christian that did not stop her coming to church she went anyway what a testimony that's powerful to me someone who's so bound up they can barely walk but yet they come anyway Hallelujah so then the Lord came and loosed to Hallelujah but yeah you need to we need to go back into our testimony because remember the devil doesn't want us to be in our first love I pray this is the year of our first love 2023 is the year of our first love I remember where it just gets greater and greater and more Hallelujah where he means more to us than than our entire life combined amen hallelujah because if he means less to us then we're in danger of going into a lukewarm condition and we remember the world is lukewarm but that spur can come unto us you know it's interesting when you go into Nations you actually see the national Spirit working you know like sadly in South Africa there's this old division racial division whatever it's all you can see it but in New Zealand it's all Easy Come Easy Go she'll be right no worries you know that's just kind of it's It's a lukewarm Spirit I'm glad I'm getting some nods because it's true right so we must be very careful that that Spirit doesn't influence our walk with God right because we are not easy come Jesus Jesus wasn't an easy cut I'll just easily go to the cross and then I go here and then that's if I go down to Hell and now I'm up in the resurrect no he it was it was it was a it was an incredible thing he went through it wasn't an easy come easy go he says for this course I've come into the world remember he was led by vision he says that he I see the father do that the son doeth likewise right so he saw by Vision what he had to do so so when he saw by when he's knew what he had to accomplish on Calvary and what he and the beatings he had to take in part of the Judgment Hall he saw that by vision and then he willingly walked into that vision he saw it and it wasn't easy come easy go it's like father if you'd be willing take this cup from me he he he wrestled wrestled it out in Gethsemane and there was a heaven was waiting for an answer will he say yes will he do it Hallelujah my life was at stake there I trust you you could recognize that too my eternal destination was at stake in that moment and then he says father not but not my will thy will be done and the yes goes back up to heaven because remember he had to choose God doesn't Force us to do anything he did not chew he did not force his son to do anything he had to willingly give his life amen so we should not just be an easy come easy go kind of believer no the violent take the kingdom by force it's going to take actually a real selling out and a real dedication and a real surrender a real consecration see if you really surrender to the Lord then the law can work through you it's not a physical violence that you and your human ability that could do it no it's in a fully surrendered life amen hallelujah Lord praise the Lord that's right that's right amen hallelujah so now our God is a god of power he's not a god of ritual he's not some formal theology see he says in the great coming revival outpouring the Holy Ghost so yeah I'll be I'll be done soon he says their Messiah was a god of power not some formal theology their God is a god of power he's the one that could can perform Miracles he's the one who knows the secrets of the hearts of the people he stands as Jehovah that's right Jesus Christ Jehovah May Flesh on Earth has raised from the dead and living among the people today and the Gentile days is finishing so he is not some formal theology now if this message is ever diminished to an argument then we are defeated when the when the Devil comes and diminishes the message the Bible to just an argument that person has been defeated because this is not an argument right it's not an argument it's not a list of doctrines it's not some persuasion or whatever no no the message is a res is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ that's what the message is and and and and if we have true Doctrine then it will be accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost because it says in Luke 4 and 32 and they are astonished at his Doctrine for his words was worth power hey man so this message should never become an argument he is the resurrection and the life Hallelujah but the devil wants it to diminish into an argument why because then we just begin to adopt a form amen but praise God we don't have to stay as a form amen but he's here this morning Amen to loose us that we can walk with a real heartfelt walk with God you say this is all very Elementary no we've got to have a first love love is a Feeling is right I can't say I love my wife and have no feeling that's right no that that's a fake but if I really love her I'll have an emotion they'll be you know because people say well the word comes into your soul there's no feeling in the soul and you know no hold on but love has an emotion with it right we're not a bunch of robots that don't feel anything because that's just a spirit realm and no we are human beings oh here okay we've got one we've got a human being here okay we've got a few more so we have emotion we have feelings right Hallelujah but so our our religion our walk with God must be a heartfelt one because that way he can mold us and shape us that that our walk doesn't become formal and indifferent yes Hallelujah see many people throw away a lot of things that God can do because of what others have done with it but it's amazing you know you take the you take the restoration of the Bright Tree you take the restoration of the church you know we love justification don't we to be justified by faith who believes is justified by fight amen all right see but then if we look at Martin Luther's life he was a trinitarian he you know he was a beer drinking pipe smoking trinitarian that hated the juice we don't throw away justification just because he did that but it was the truth being restored there's a lot of error but there's the truth we take that part of the truth don't we right now Wesley believed in sanctification who believes in sanctum you know a holy life who believes in that right now but Wesley we know had a method of sanctification a human method that's why they're called methodists but a true sanctification is actually the power of the blood comes into us and sanctifies our life from all unclean things right but then Wesley you know didn't didn't baptize correctly had all kinds of wrong things but we don't throw away sanctification just because he taught Samira because remember truth was being restored no amen anyone loves that kind of thing but the question is then why do we throw away the power of Pentecost just because of what the Pentecostals have done see why do we throw it away see people will throw away the gifts the moving of the spirit because well the Pentecostals went to seed on that look what they'd done look at what they do but why do we throw that away when that was a restoration of the gifts that was a work of God bringing restoring back his word see so we shouldn't see if we throw something away because of what someone else has done it can just become a form hey man it does see in my opinion man I'm very simple I don't it doesn't matter what other people have done with this they'll be accountable but it's for me hey man right yeah Joshua and Caleb did not throw away the promised land because of what Cora and Nathan did or anyone else no they said the promises for me that should be the same thing it may not be for someone else but it's for me I mean to everything that is of god is for me amen justification is for me sanctification is for me the gifts of the Holy Ghost as for me if God wants me to speak in tongues it's for me if he wants me to prophesy it's for me if he wants me to dance in the spirit it's for me whatever he has I want I don't just want part of him I want the whole word I want all nine spiritual gifts manifested in the local body that's what I want to see Hallelujah I want to see the spirit of God move I want to see a heartfelt religion on everyone's face amen why because it's for me Hallelujah that's how we want to be amen so thank God now Hallelujah though we live in a time of great indifference and great argument and great fussing and great coldness and people saying they have need of nothing in other words they don't need the Lord yet we can stand in this darkest of Ages you know I was thinking of maybe I'll preach at another time where it's incredible well where where we Rejoice being freed from the world from drugs or alcohol pornography whatever in the world lust whatever more but to me a greater Miracle is to be freed from a lukewarm spirit to me that's a powerful thing because someone who's lukewarm can look so right but they can be so wrong it can be so deceptive amen so that we can Rejoice if we're being freed from that lukewarm Spirit of formality where where our hearts hunted anymore but the Lord restores us back we can rejoice in that Hallelujah so I'm gonna I'm Gonna Leave It just there but I pray this year would be a year of our first love right and I believe the Lord wants us to give us a closer walk with him than ever before Hallelujah you say well I just seem to have a form you don't have to have a form he wants to walk with you more than you want him he waited all thousands of years for you to be born he rejoiced when you came to the Earth he rejoiced that day when he had it on his calendar the countdown I'm gonna meet them amen I'm going to meet them they get so excited you yo Adam Adam was sad because he was alone but he was manifesting God's loneliness he it's not good that God's alone say he thought of you and he put you upon the Earth and he put a date in the calendar at this time in this place they may not expect me but I've been expecting them and he came and found you that he would walk with you and know you and the power of his resurrection and he would be with you and your sufferings and your pain and your hurts and your glory and your rejoicing he's been looking forward to this day so I pray o God that this would be a day a year of our first love that whatever happens has happened in the past let's just put it under the blood let's not let us hold us back anymore let's press the mark of the high calling in Christ whatever's happened has happened we can't change last year we can't change whenever our birth or our family or whatever upbringing we can't change that but we can let him change us and our future Hallelujah amen so let's just stand to our feet this morning hallelu let's have the musicians please I mean I like to sing that song um thank you Jesus
