take it away i sing my natural family but also church family the bride amen praise the lord uh let's go so we're in john chapter one i'm going to read from verse 24 down to 37 then we're going to go to hebrews chapter 12. um here i'd like to say god bless the tech team who got a lot younger appreciate you very much god bless you amen i didn't see anyone twisting their necks around seeing what's going on so obviously went fine i mean that's a big indication of how things are going amen if you're not noticed there it's going well i mean it's a god bless you appreciate that filling in amen so john chapter 1 verse 24 here we're going to read down to verse 37. um we have it here um and so so this is uh we'll actually start from verse 23 sorry he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet isaiah and they were sent and they which was and they i'm yeah i'll get there i can read and they which were sent were of the pharisees sometimes there's questions about that but apparently i can and they asked him and they said unto him why baptize thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom you know not he um he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe latch it i am not worthy to unloose these things were done in beth abba beyond jordan where john was baptizing the next day john saith jesus coming unto him and he saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that i should but sorry that he should be made manifest israel therefore am i am i come baptizing with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it bowed upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou see shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record this is the son of god again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walketh he saith behold the lamb of god and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus amen and we're going to go to hebrews chapter 12 and just verses 1-3 here i'm sure these are very familiar scriptures to us all so hebrews 12 and verses 1 to 3 it says here he says wherefore seeing you also can pass about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that has set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endureth such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds amen let's just bow heads in a word of prayer this morning you if you ever need you just want to talk to the lord as we're praying or raise up your hand as however you feel to express yourself to the lord let's pray together gracious father we thank you lord that we can look we can look away to jesus as we sang the song here lord this morning thank you dear god we can see that crimson stream of blood that flows from calvary thank you lord that we can come into your presence this morning and just to give you praise and honor and glory and i just want to ask lord may you come once again father sometimes i feel like i say the same kind of prayer every service but lord we need you to come and anoint the word to our hearts lord we're not interested of some lecture or some man's idea lord i'm not even interested in my own ideas lord we want your word lord your thoughts oh god your intent lord jesus father to come and you'd fill our lives and lord you'd leave such a permanent impression on our souls lord by the seal of the baptism of the holy ghost i pray that you touch each life here lord jesus may you be with those who are streaming as well who couldn't make it today may be their portion father they're as they're the unseen uh uh ones in attendance lord as we have gathered ourselves together unto you this morning i pray you'd anoint them bless them keep them strengthen them as well for those who are sick and body o god we want to live before your throne of grace once again as well lord may he touch each one father may you heal them may they know that thou art with them lord you are their strength and their comfort we love you so much lord we just pray you'd have your way for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so i'd like to uh continue on from a couple of sundays ago i was talking about look away to jesus and i want to continue about that just saying look um john the baptist here his whole his whole ministry had had had come down to this moment and this was the purpose of his of him coming to the earth was that he would identify the messiah now i know this is probably all very familiar but you know if we could just realize if we could look and see what god has done then we can gain the benefits of what he has done and it's very important that we look especially in this hour we need to look to jesus amen we need to look to him so john the baptist he was he was there to prepare the way of the lord as we read he would quote uh malachi and he'd say i am the fulfillment of that of that scripture and the thing is now brother brown would was saying the message look and you know in that message he's preaching after the seals are open he's trying to get the people to see something he says he says now he says i'm um he says but the voice that i'm trying to say to you this morning is like the writer of this epistle we believe to be paul which is saying looking for the coming of jesus christ the second time looking for him in order to do it you've got to see something before you can tell somebody else to look at what you're seeing i mean so so if you haven't seen it you can't tell but if you've seen him you can tell i mean so we've got to be very careful that we know what we're looking at because we can be looking at something but we can't see it you know there can be something in a picture uh it can be right in front of you but once you see it i mean if if you can't see it you can't see it but once you see it you cannot stop from seeing it amen you know so it's got to be you know i remember um years ago now well i don't know how many years ago i was up in the far north of brother malcolm one i went off as a gentlemanly uh pig hunt and um we were on our way back any any and and then across the you know a couple of fields and in this bush by this bush there was this white dog sitting there it was one of the neighbors or something he says look can't you see that dog and i couldn't see it you know but it was right there he said no no look see that dog right there then i saw it and then once i saw it i couldn't unsee it because i saw it and it's the same thing with the lord today i mean you can look at the you can look at the picture but but but when the lord opens your eyes to see it then you look then you're really looking amen and i believe that in god's great sovereign grace and spirit is is here i mean it's in our lives it's working that we can look we can look to jesus now john we know he he he he was there to identify the messiah and his and that was the purpose of him being there now he had to be shown by god what he was to point out i mean so he said you know the lord told him that the one he sees a spirit come you land upon and descend like a dove that's the messiah and then so because jesus looked like anyone else he didn't have any kind of fancy robe he didn't look any different he looked like just a common man you know even the bible would say that you know when we see him there's nothing in him that we would desire him he just looked like a common normal man so john would john would see uh in a vision he would see that happening of the spirit coming down descending upon the lord and say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world and so those who are looking for who who john was pointing out would see the one he's identifying amen and it said that those two disciples followed the lord jesus so in order to to to to see you have to be able to look now this may i hope this doesn't sound like a circular thing but when i'm saying you know when people say look what i'm talking about they're saying can you see can you understand can you comprehend and even that word which says looking under jesus means to consider attentively to look i mean so john pointed the lord out and then and then people began to follow the lord now he had to look in order to point if he wasn't looking he couldn't point him out now it's very easy to point out things that aren't important in life you know there's a lot of things we could actually if we look at the grand scale of the world there's a lot of things that aren't important really you know when you bring it into consideration with eternity and what god's doing upon the earth there's some things that aren't really important the price of cucumbers isn't really important the price of tomatoes you know the price of meat it's really not that important i mean sure on on the scale it's important in terms of food prices have gone up but in the grand scheme does it really matter i mean it's just the conditions of the time we're living in so we can point those things out but you know we we should be pointing out the important thing you know brother graham says in one message i couldn't quite find the quote but the paraphrase he says you know we can easily spend so much time telling people what not to do but we should really tell them what they should be doing which is to believe on the lord jesus christ and thine of thy house shall be saved so so paul paul said that to the philippian jailer because the philippians said what shall i do he says believe in the lord jesus christ and thine in thy house in other words he said look to the lord the one we've been singing about the one we've been testifying about in the jail look to him and and and you will get i mean what he wants to give you he will give you salvation for you and and and for your house so the apostle paul told them to look now the believer i believe the lord's given us sight that we can see by faith amen now really what you can see shows where you're living now brother brown would uh parallel the the um the tabernacle in the wilderness and he says it's you know you know it's it's like the three areas of the tabernacle is the three stages of the christian walk first is you come into the outer court where the where the sacrifice was offered okay so so you're justified by faith it's good you've come and it's good you've been justified by faith but don't stop there we have to go into the holy of holies and then and then once that you go into the inner court where the whether with the with the shoe bread is and there's the menorah there's the seven golden candlesticks all those things you know that's that sanctification it's good to go in there but you don't want to go and you you just don't want to stay there you've got to go into the holy of holies and the presence of god into the baptism of the holy ghost and because the thing is when you go into the inner court there you're living by an artificial light you're living by a church light now brother braham says and if i can find it maybe i should have just stuck with my notes being printed out but he says here he says see so it really shows where you're living in that area i mean in those places it shows your experience so if you're in the arctic court there's no roof over your heads if it rains you get wet if it's cold you get cold if it's sunny you get sunburned it's all based on the atmosphere of the environment of the world dictates to you your experience right but if you go into the inner court you've got a roof over your head but you've got to keep putting oil into the into the cold um seven golden candlesticks to see it's man-made light it's man-made effort right but then once you go through the veil into the holiest of all you don't have to pour any oil in the shekinah glory of god is there amen life comes forth he you don't it's it's not you trying to be the christian it's him pulsating out of you him being the christian right so so it really depends what you look at is where you live he would say in the inner vale in 1956 he says now you've seen miss jones over there who's supposed to be a christian do something wasn't right you say well i wonder if there's anything to it see you've still got your eyes on miss jones see you're still walking with artificial light so if we look at well brother so-and-so did this sister so-and-so did this this church said this this preacher did this and it dictates to us our christian walk and i wonder if there's anything to it is it really true you know you're still living in an artificial light i mean but if you go beyond that that our christian walk shouldn't be based on what each other's doing right our christian walk is up and us in god us and the lord jesus right so so it doesn't matter what's going on around us sure it will affect us if we have a heart we will be burdened if something you know someone's struggling or there's pain or hurt or you know because we're not robots right we do care for one another church yet amen i hope right so but you know it that shouldn't push us off the journey right we should just keep going on so we don't want to um our victory should not be based on how others are going our victory should be based on who the lord is and what he's done so but the man who walked in behind the holiest of holies it didn't matter whether the sun shined or not didn't matter whether candles burned or not he lived in the light of the shekinah glory where the pillar of fire dwelt under the interlock winds of the wings of the cherubim and all the time he's walking in the perfect light and fellowship he didn't look to the outside to the rainy days there was never a rainy day never a doubt never a time when he was hungry for god because in him was stored up the manner of god the word built up unto a righteous foundation he had not to worry no more certainly not he was inside the world was outside that's what the church needs today is an experience that will take them under the shekinah glory where all the curtains will fall and hide the man from the things of the world till you live in the presence of god and under his great power under the interlock wings of the holy ghost and in the cross you'll stand and the cross don't become a burden anymore it picks up wings and flies away i mean i like how he puts that i mean so if we if we're looking to what each other's doing and that and that and that affects our walk i say let's go to the shekinah glory amen so john pointed out the lamb of god now the reason he pointed him out is because his his ministry was for the people to follow the messiah for the people to become one with the messiah and receive eternal life so he was actually saying look at him he is the fount of eternal life he's the lamb of god that will take away the sin of the world i mean so it's the same thing today you know we have to we have to look and if we look by faith then we'll get what he wants to give us amen like he would say here with um um and and second second corinthians three he says now the spirit i mean the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with uh with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so he's saying we are looking amen when the lord when the lord takes away i mean takes away the veil that you can see you are looking at something now where it's not obscured anymore the word is not obscured the lord is not is he three or two or one or you know all these questions they're gone because you see him as he is right you see that it's not man's ideas that put the bible together but this is the word of god this is god in print form amen and then so now you're looking you're looking at the lord and now you're being changed into what you're looking at amen because now if we can look by faith to what he has done and what he is doing then the power of what he has done can flow into our lives and manifest in us i mean you know that's why john pointed out the messiah says behold the lamb of god what was he pointing out you walk with him and he'll give you a pentecost you'll walk with him he'll give you eternal life it's in him he wants to give it to you but look on him amen because remember there's no there's no virtue and worry worry hasn't helped anyone since adam till now worry has helped no one if you look to worry if you look to anxiety if you look to problems that won't help you i remember faith can deliver that's why you should look to faith i mean you should look away from worry be safe but it's so real yes it is real you know we can't just bury our heads in the sand we're not a bunch of ostriches that just bury their head in the sand right sure this worry sure there's trouble we're in a time of trouble we're not exempt from trouble but we can look on him i mean he can give us strength to to to go through the trouble i mean to go through the anguish it doesn't mean just because you feel troubled it doesn't mean that you're not an overcomer right but you're overcoming by what you look to i mean by by your source of strength as david said my help cometh from the lord i mean he had a lot of trouble he had a lot of pressure and trouble going on but he knew who his source of strength was and he looked to the right one he looked to the one who gave him the promise you're gonna sit on the throne he looked to the one that that that the spirit of god you know the anointing that was poured upon him by a vindicated prophet he looked to the one who gave him the promise it wasn't samuel the you know that gave him the promise it was god himself so he looked to him amen and if we can look to the lord who said you're going in a rapture you'll be made in my image amen you will amen you have eternal life in you by the baptism of the holy ghost that my blood is enough amen that you are here you're more than able to overcome this age because of what what i have done we've got to look to him amen amen now now by saying this i'm not saying you're not looking i just want to encourage you just look amen look to your source of strength i mean we need him more than ever before in this age we need god more than any other age i believe because this world is so much darker it's so much nastier it's so much more terrible trouble on every hand but yet our god is stronger our god is greater our god is still capable amen he's not panicking he knows exactly what he's doing but we've got to look to him amen and but i think we can rejoice this morning he's made us that we can look i mean the scribes and pharisees looked at the same jesus as as those disciples you know and they said well he's beelzebub he's just you know he's a fortune teller one bible whatever i mean they looked at the same one that the disciples looked at but peter looked at him and said but to whom shall we go you have the you alone have the words of eternal life because he had faith he was given grace to look amen aren't you glad for that grace this morning hallelujah amen that because what we're looking into will transform us or deform us this world is a bunch of it's a deformation not a restoration it's a deforming world it wants to take our identity from us even our gender anything just wants to make it all grey and the same amen but but god wants to transform us into his image amen but it depends what you're looking at amen so i say if you're looking at something that deforms you that troubles you that weakens your faith you're looking at the wrong thing amen but if you're looking at the lord amen it'll he'll build your faith whoever feels encouraged you just read a couple of promises and you feel your faith just shoot up and praise the lord i can i can press the battle why because the lord is because you're actually drawing strength amen from because you're looking at the right thing hallelujah now as i'm sure as we go along in our christian walk we begin to realize that you know our walk becomes more by faith than by sight as we walk with god because god wants to mature us right and and but but there's a victory in maturity because we can look back and say what we once did we don't do no more well who did that to us it was god it wasn't just because we got older and became more set in our ways no that can be actually a hindrance you know you can't teach an old dog new tricks they say but you know if you can look back and say you know you can see the things i once did the things i once saw my attitudes have changed everything who did that it wasn't yourself it was god i mean so so there's a victory in maturity because the more mature we become now when i talk about maturity here i'm not talking about a physical maturity i'm talking about a spiritual maturity so you can be 12 years old and you can be the most mature christian there is amen it's not about age oh no i'm fully no no it's it's spiritual maturity i'm talking about right so so the more mature we become in the lord i believe the more we walk by faith and not by sight i mean so so our faith actually overrides our five senses more and more every day now abraham looked one day remember god told him come out of this land i'll give you a new land and so he looked at the one that was talking to him and he followed that voice we know it was the voice of the lord now he came to a point in his life where his faith overrode his conditions now you think about abraham he was 99 years old cyril was about 90. but yet the promise was was was was hanging over them you're going to have the promised son they were living under that yo that promise was theirs it wasn't for someone else it was them i mean when you can see your name in the word it's not just for someone else it's for you it changes your whole life i mean it's abraham because he looked at the one giving the promise and he began to realize that that the one that's told me to look on him the one who's saying look on me amen he realized the one who gave the promise was able to fulfill the promise now if you look at abraham's circumstances it was literally it was impossible and this is not stretching the imagination at all it was literally impossible for them to have the child they he was 99 years old cyril was about 90 you know they were well up in age well past you know menopause had come and gone for sarah all those things that happened they couldn't have children even from when they were young so he felt old he looked old he would have sounded old i mean he would have probably thought old well how do you think old well i mean like even now the last time i ever tried to play indoor soccer you know i pulled muscles just warming up and that wasn't that long ago i'm not old but a few years before that you just run and you jump and yeah you don't think about you're not worried about pulling anything you know but you're not bad i did some damage you know anyway but and and that was just to myself so i realized so so you're gonna think now hold on can i you know can i do this you're making a thing old you don't feel old but you i mean you and yourself you still feel young but you gotta you realize this thing man what's happened to the guy where can i get a warrant of fitness where can i you know i need to trade up or something you know what i mean i need some parts replaced so the older you get the more you think you know can i do this like i used to so he would have thought old he looked old he felt all this he spoke old so all of his five senses declared he was old and sarah she looked old she sounded old she acted old right but then as as he walked with god his faith overrode the his own present condition right his faith overrode it amen so so his present condition did not hinder the revelation that god had put in his heart that they were going to have the promised son it did not hinder it amen because the apostle paul would speak in romans and he would say that abraham when when when he would write the commentary of abraham's life he says that is as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and caught those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that that what he had promised he was also able to perform amen so abraham came to the spot in his life he didn't stagger he laughed you know their son was called isaac not just because sarah laughed abraham laughed he laughed in the prince of god god came down supernatural being came down and said you're gonna have the promised son and there's abraham laughing and the prince of god saying how can this be but there came a point where the revelation that was deposited in overrode his his unbelief amen and and so he came to a point where he staggered none of the promise of god now i pray when god writes about my life this will be my eulogy he didn't stagger at my promise he was strong in faith giving glory to god and it was fully persuaded what he had promised he was also able to perform i mean that's what i pray the lord would say about you and i amen we may abraham had his ups and downs sure but he came to a spot where he didn't stag him hallelujah why because he was beholding he was looking at the one who could give him strength amen he was able to look and he saw that god was not just a god that led him to the promised land but he looked and saw that god is also the strength giver amen our trust is the same thing with you and i he's not just the one who saves our souls but he gives us strength i mean he gives us strength that the promise can become manifested in our lives as as as the lord would appear we know that he appeared to abraham in many different names but it was the same god wasn't a different god it was the same god and so in genesis 17 and 1 it says the lord appeared to abraham when abraham was 99 years old now if you go down into the hebrew that word lord if you go down to the root meaning of the word it means which is al-shaddai which is which is the breasted god like a woman that breast feeds a baby the strength giver amen so here was a um abram before he became abraham 99 years old but god says now i'm going to reveal myself to you as the strength giver as the life giver so now when i call you you're going to look upon me as the strength giver because remember we need to look and when we look as god reveals himself we receive what he wants to give us i mean so he was a str strength giver like a baby you know a baby nursing from a mother's breast drawing strength and growing he says here this is a from from jehovah jireh he says and he appeared him in the name of god almighty and the hebrews el shaddai which probably means the breast of a woman said abraham i'm appearing to you now as the breasted one i am the mother you're old your strength is all gone but i'm the breasted god in other words your strength is gone but i am the one who can nurse you back to strength again god almighty if he was that to abraham he's got to be that to abraham's seed for the same promises no matter how sick you are how far you've gone lay hold of god's eternal promises and nurse your life back again how far you're in sin how you know you may be a prostitute from the street but that same promise is to you if you'll dare to take hold of god i mean so he's saying now that the same god that gave strength to abraham to fulfill his promises in the word is the same one if we draw strength from his word we'll we'll change our bodies i mean if we realize actually our god has not just given us promises that now we have to fulfill them in our own strength but he gives us the promises and then he gives us the strength to fulfill those promises then because salvation is of the lord it's got nothing to do with you and i god gives the ability to fulfill his word that's why the holy ghost is so vital because it enables the believer to fulfill his word i mean this is not us trying to be christians in our own strength this is not us trying to be message believers in our own strength and keep the word our own strength no it's our surrendering to god and letting him come and fill us with his goodness with his word that he lives out of us amen but it's so important because the more a promise can linger that's the more important that you nurse off that promise i mean abraham had 25 years to nurse off you know god's strength you could say because the promise had lingered for 25 years but he nursed strength from the lord so the more something seems to linger don't give up don't quit i mean just keep nursing strength from god almighty amen because in his time he wants to fulfill it you know what kind of character would we have if god gave us everything like this what kind of character would we have amen because remember they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength we wait for god's timing yeah we want everything like this this is an instant age you know you do a google search and how it tells you how many hits and how long it took you to you know get them all those things and it's all instant but with god god's timing's different than our timing but he wants to give us the character that we can wait upon him and the more we wait upon him the more strength we should have and the more rejoicing we should have in our and our being because god is in control but we just got to draw strength from him it depends who you're looking to abraham was looking to god amen brother brown would say there before before the visitation in genesis 18. you're on the plains of memory you know he said that even your brother brown would dramatize it he'd say well you know sarah was a bit fussy and but then abraham brother braham said kept the spiritual atmosphere around him why because he'd been drawing strength he means drawing strength god had visited many times but now was coming the season where remember abraham had had his visitation but now sarah needed her visitation genesis 18 was actually sarah's visitation that the church would receive a revelation that that that she could have the promised son amen just like us the church has been waiting two thousand years for the you know you're for us to meet the lord in the air but now god has sent a visitation to the earth through malachi 4. i mean that same ministry has come back again to turn our hearts back to the original faith that we can receive strength amen that we can receive the promised son hallelujah so so abraham kept the spiritual atmosphere around him how do you do that well a soft answer turns away wrath i mean don't get caught up in the nitty-gritty of the argument you just go beyond it amen you be loving you'd be kind you know you know be the peacemaker in the family don't join sides just be the peacemaker look beyond the situation you know don't be caught up in the will this happened listen no look beyond it right when you know our home shouldn't be parliament whereas a debating chamber which seems to be full of kindergarten kids you know it shouldn't be oh there's the opposition yeah i remember one of my maths classes as in uh year year 11 if that's it now you know we were seated based on score of test results and there was the government started the prime minister was the head of the class then went to the opposition then the bottom was the greens so you can see what that teacher thought of them but anyway it was funny but uh yeah but you know but out our our family shouldn't be like that well madame speaker did it mr speaker did it literally you know no no no hold on they should be peaceful the only opposition we have is the devil and he's not welcome in my my chamber amen so you know be the peacemaker so abraham drew strength from the lord and remember he if he was our shadow back then he's still the same today because he hasn't changed so we can draw strength amen we can be nourished back to health again if we just draw from him he's still our shadow tonight amen even even in genesis 35 when the lord appeared to jacob again um when it says in god appeared to jacob again there he's actually revealing himself in the same way to jacob so that we know it was abraham isaac and jacob so as a future generation the lord appeared to himself as the strength giver so to me that shows that he's the same yesterday today and forever i can't encourage you enough if you need spiritual strength draw strength from him draw strength from the word amen don't be don't don't don't draw strength on social media don't draw strength from just mindless scrolling what they used to call it with covert doom scrolling or gloom scrolling just people scrolling they just read bad news all the time don't be caught up in that is it going to make you happy is it going to make you rejoice is it going to make you a better person no it's going to do the opposite so why not why not feed off something that's positive i mean something that's been proven having something that's alive something that's real something that can help you something that can deliver i mean which is the word of god you know the devil does the devil will never encourage you to read your bible he will never encourage you to pray he'll never encourage you to put on a message he'll never encourage you to put on good spiritual music he'll never encourage he won't say no no i know i'm giving you a hard time but you should really go pray it'll help you he will never tell you he he'll give you a million things you need to do and you know what's wrong with this person why are you offended with this person what's going on with this person all those different things that's what he'll tell you and if you again to agree with him you're looking at the wrong person my help does not come from satan my help cometh from the lord amen and that's how we want to be hallelujah now the apostle paul would make this great statement he says for we walk by faith and not by sight now before he would make that statement he'd begin to talk about our earthly um you know though this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan desire earnestly designed to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven for for uh if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groans this one being burdened not for that which we should we would be unclosed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life so he's saying that the reason we've grown is not that we just want to quit and leave the world no we just want to be in heaven and then he and then he continues down here he says now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing as of god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord and he says but we walk by faith and not by sight so here hear the apostle paul would say we have a building in the heavens already we have what we call it the office it's already there it's been revealed so he looked and he saw the lord on the road to damascus and as he kept looking unto jesus the lord began to reveal more and more to him about his future home what he's meant to do upon the earth you know all the things that were going on and he said the reason we but this is me basically the reason we walk by faith and not by sight is because we have a home in the heavens so basically what happens upon the earth is not going to change the fact when this heart stops beating i'm going to step into an eternal body and it's already there for me it's not it's not being made right now the finishing touches aren't being put on it right now it's not on the assembly line about to come off it's already there waiting for me and it can't be dissolved it can't go away it can't it can't be deleted based on me down here it's already there i mean if you're an elect of god you have one in the heavens already so the reason he could walk and overcome and be victorious as he looked and he saw the lord and he saw hey this one this is god this is the messiah he's the god of the old testament i thought i was worshiping but i'm actually worshiping creeds of man but but he's a real true and living god and he's revealed to me that i have a body waiting in the heavens that's why he could say death where is your sting grave where is your victory but thanks be it the god who gives us a victory through our lord jesus christ i mean so his his his walk was not by sight now you think about his walk who was by sight he would have quit a long time ago you know he meets the lord on the road to damascus and then he goes to damascus and and it comes a time where people in damascus want to kill him he's got to be light over the wall by a basket run for his life you know he's stoned he's beaten he's chased from city to city he preaches in one city goes to another the ones that hate him in the previous city follow him to the next city and they stir the people up who are beginning to believe and yeah there's all this bunch of trouble going on chained to roman soldiers in dungeons shipwrecked bitten by the you know aspen all these or viper whatever it was on yo so he had a lot of trouble but he walked by faith and not by sight because his faith overrode what he was what his five senses were declaring because he looked amen and that's why the apostle said looking unto jesus now it was revealed to john that uh who the messiah was now faith is a revelation now when when it's revealed when something's revealed to us the reason it's done is that it would become reality and be manifested right when it's really revealed to you that you're healed then you become healed right when it's really revealed to you that your sins are washed away your life is different when it's revealed to you that calvary is more than a story but it's for you your life is different you can't help living different gods revealed to you hey i took your sins that day up calvary it's not just for someone else it's for you your whole life has changed amen when he gives you the baptism of the holy ghost there's a revelation god's in me amen not just anointed me but he dwells in me your whole life is different amen and we know revelation is more than just a mental understanding but you know your life has changed because of revelation now if you could if if we could just this may seem quite elementary but if we could just really recognize what the lord has already done for us not will do but has already done and we look at that i think it will change our lives i mean so even if we could go back into the old testament we know there's many uh laws and ceremonies and things which well we know all the law uh represented you know all the feasts and and and all the offerings they represented and shadow the lord jesus christ now the reason the jubilee trumpet blew was because the blood had been offered so we know in the old testament there was every 50 years was a jubilee and now every year the high priest had to had to take the blood of your blood offering into the holy of holies and sprinkle the mercy seat for the sins of the people so that was done every year but on the 50th year there was a jubilee which is a release right so those who are in slavery they could go free on that jubilee year if they chose to now the trumpet did not blow before the blood was offered it was all done after the fact right so so the high priest went in the blood was offered after he came out then the trumpets blew telling all of israel that the blood had been offered on their behalf so now they had to look i could say not with their physical eyes but you could say by the ears right and and if they believed it they could look to see the blood was applied for them and they could walk free i mean they could look and say it's the year of jubilee i have a right because of what the high priest has done on my behalf i can walk free because of what he has done so if they could look and say my sunday's been paid it's all been taken care of i have a legal right i can leave my slavery there's no sin dead upon me no more because the blood has been applied i mean they could walk free if they would just look right so so the blowing of the jubilee trumpet was a recognition that this had already been done hallelujah it wasn't going to be done it had already been done and so those who heard the jubilee trumpet and they walked free they because they had faith that the high priest went in and did it for them now they couldn't see the high priest going there was no live stream there was nothing they could physically go and see him physically do it but by faith they had to look and believe it and receive it then act upon it and walk free because it had already been done for them and it's the same thing our lord jesus is our high priest right he is offered by his own blood i mean he took his own blood into into glory for an atonement for our for our salvation amen and then now he came back down to earth he filled his church with the holy ghost and now that became the jubilee trumpet amen and now the prophet stood here and he was a jubilee trumpet to this age right no it's not it's not a physical instrument no more it's it's a living voice i mean so now the message to me it's never been rules and regulations it's been divine love expressed saying you can go free from sin you can go free from heartache you go free from trouble you go free from your past and you can you can you can forget those things and walk on with the lord jesus and be made a new creature to me it's been liberty amen now even even the scapegoat which which would be performed as well where where they'd take two goats and they would they would kill one and they would they would offer that blood but then they would they would put two hands on the head of the living goat and then so the high priest would do this put his two hands on the living goat's head and they would confess all the sins of the people and all their inequities you know all their transgressions and then they would they would take someone a chosen man would take that goat and would lead him into the wilderness and leave him there now some people would attribute this this scapegoat actually as a devil but no both of those goats represent christ because he's our offering but he's also our scapegoat walker's living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away the devil has no part in the atonement he's not even he's not even in the agreement with with us and god it's not him god and you this is not a three-way agreement it's actually a two-way agreement god and you amen he advanced some glory to you saying i purchased your salvation amen i've taken your sins far away i'm going to make you in my image i'm going to take you in a rapture i'm going to give you overcoming power this is this is what the lord did right he and in the old testament are in the oriental times like that if two men made an agreement they would they would kill an animal and they and they would say those who cannot fulfill their end of the bargain may they be like this dead animal so the lord came down he knew you couldn't keep it could could adam keep a conditional covenant no could israel no it was given to abraham by grace i have made you father of nations it's not if thou will i will but he saw man it wasn't in man to fulfill his end of the bargain so he he didn't put us on a conditional covenant he just said no no yeah we're we're going to make this a um covenant but i will be like the dead animal that's why he gave himself on calvary because he knew you couldn't keep you into the bargain amen so now atonement is all of the lord the devil has no part in it so so both of these goats are actually our representations of our lord jesus christ so now he had to be this goat had to be taken by a chosen man into the wilderness now with goats i think i think it's like sheep they can if they if they know who you are they can follow you so apparently this one who is to lead the goat into the wilderness had to cover their head so so the goat wouldn't recognize him take him into the wilderness and then he had to basically just abandon him there in order for the wild and you know and then the wild beasts and things would have tore that goat limb from limb because it wouldn't know where it was now our lord jesus was gladly our scapegoat because the joy set before him he endured the cross despising the shame amen so brother braham sit here and and living dying buried rising coming he says now he was also in this berry he represented in the old testament he said they had a sin offering at the cleansing of the sanctuary and that sin offering was that they'd taken two goats one guy was killed and the other goat had the sins were placed upon the dead goat put upon the live goat remember jesus was a sheep he was a lamb but in this case he became a goat he was righteousness because he was god the sheep but he became a goat sin that he might be the sin offering for you and i from a sheep to a goat and jesus was represent represented in both animals both goats for he died he died for the atonement the sick and the sins from the atonement was put on the scapegoat and the scapegoat took the sins of the people and went far into the wilderness to bear the sins of the people what was it it was the death and burial of our lord jesus dying living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away he took the sins of the people upon himself and carried them plumbed down to the lowest of hades he was the sin offering he had the sins of the people he died for them and also the sins was placed upon him and he took our sins far away so far that god could never see them no more hallelujah think of it now you could just he says he says oh the church could scream hallelujah for such a savior not only is the sins forgiven but they're buried in the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more see if you really realize you're you're not just forgiven your sins are carried far away i mean that there there should be no more condemnation upon you because our scapegoat the lord jesus christ carried them far away and he didn't bring them back amen that they are put in the sea of god's forgetfulness you know the it says one place in the scripture that the sea is so deep even the adders can't get down to the bottom of them amen to the sea of god's forgetfulness is so deep the devil can't swim down and pluck up what's in the bottom of it hallelujah so now our sins aren't remember our sins aren't just put in god's folder for for one day where he gets anointed us and pulls out says remember what you do no no that's not how it works the blood of jesus christ annihilates sin amen they've been carried far away and the devil will have their answer for that sin on the day of judgment not you it's not attributed to you anymore it's gone hallelujah amen so remember if we could just look remember look if you look to the lord that he's carried your sins far away then all the condemnation of your past it just goes because he's taken it away it's gone hallelujah amen see you've got to look see the devil will try and get you to look at your memory but don't be haunted by a memory right just just bring the memory into the present so hold on yes i was that person once upon a time once upon a time but devil hold on i'm just going to update you let's just scroll the video forward let's scroll the video actually no no let's scroll the video back way before there was time before the foundation of the world the lamb was slaying and in that great slam lamb amen i was in him there i was an attribute of god hallelujah and satan that's why that's why god asked job where were you before the foundation of the world where the sons of god the morning stars shouted for joy you know satan god was trying god was telling job to look and to see you were back there and me rejoicing i didn't see you on the ash heap in your great trial i saw you overcoming this thing shouting rejoicing on the other side and that's why the prophet would say that we justified we never did it in the first place well the first place was god's mind before the foundation of the world so when god thought of you and i he didn't see us in this thing troubled and you know in this fallen condition now he saw us as perfect redeemed sons and daughters of god maintenance image sinless and you know sinless perfection hallelujah that's why the prophet said you never did it in the first place we'll go back to the first place because remember this message well actually all of life if i put it this way we are going back to our point of origin right so natural life is staying here if i put it that way but eternal life we're going back from where we came from that's why we can say i have a body in the heavens waiting amen eternal in the heavens so this message is actually a one calling people who are actually attributes of god it's not haphazard you're a believer it's not because of your family it's not because of your grandparents or your lineage natural lineage whatever you know it's far beyond that and god put a seat of predestination in you and he called you by his word and here you are a believer because remember when the lord does something he attributes to all it to all of his children that's why jesus did not have to die on the cross when i accept him as my savior he'd already done it right he didn't have to shed any more blood to heal me he'd already done it right he's already done it i remember when he did it i was on his mind it was attributed to me that's why in whenever year it was when you met the lord it became alive to you because he did it back there for you remember god doesn't run his business in a haphazard way he doesn't he's got purpose right he doesn't have collateral he has no he has his children and he died on calvary to redeem his children his family i mean that's why it means something to you no matter how much you fail fall whatever there's something in you saying lord you purchase my salvation i want to get up one more time i want to keep serving you i mean because he put a desire in you i mean far greater than your failure and your own um you know your own discouragement far above those things to get up and keep walking on amen amen hallelujah not only is our sins forgiven i just want to read this again because it makes me feel happy for they're buried in the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more isn't it amazing god can forget the one who made all things and can see through time through foreknowledge he can forget hallelujah you know the devil can't forget god can forget you know it's amazing we can god can fully forgive us of something take it from his memory and then the devil brings it up again and we can feel so burdened by it and we can cry to god god forgive me for such and such a thing and then as he's praying to us he looks through his great record book and he finds your name and all he sees is a blank page there's no what do you mean there's no you know what do you mean that sin it's not there it's gone why cause his blood cleanses our book hallelujah amen he takes it all away it's gone amen now there there are certain uh it's very important that we keep looking not just once but keep looking now peter after the resurrection you know i'm amazed by peter peter peter would be the one who would who would who would curse denying the lord try and kill a cataman's head off but because he wasn't a swordsman just cut off his ear you know did all these wild things we'd say you know but but peter peter was a kind of a man you know there was there was such a great quality in him he knew that the lord was the messiah and even though he denied the lord and god told him he would do it but he was so proud he wouldn't listen but he denied the lord he went badly after doing it all those things but then after the resurrection peter said to some of the disciples i'm just going to go fishing again i'm a fisherman this is just who i am let's go fishing again and and some of the others said yeah we'll go fishing with you and then so and they caught nothing there's a breaking of the dawn they see a figure standing on the seashore saying children have you caught anything i doubt very much they would have in a sing-song voice said no that would have been grumpy fishing all night throw the net here throw it here take the boat there nothing but yet the lord came to him because the lord wanted him to look he did not want peter to stay in this discouraged downcast state this same thing with us he doesn't want us to stay that way he wants to bring us through those things then it becomes a victory it becomes a testimony so there's this peter he's denied the lord three times he's whipped bitterly he's a miserable failure of a you know of a disciple he feels he's washed up he's he's done too much wrong but the lord appears on the physically on the seashore calls out because he doesn't want to leave peter in that state and then so peter peter looks you could say and he says noah caught nothing but then john tells peter look again i'm just i'm just rephrasing it look again look again at that figure it's not just a casual observer look again it's the lord and peter looked and he saw the lord there and there was something in him but he says i've just got to get to him so i'm not just going to look from afar i'm going to get into his presence it's the same thing with you and i we don't want to look afar and say we want to get into his presence he didn't know if he'd be accepted but there's something in the believer i'm going anyway hallelujah greater than discouragement pain hurt disappointment in their own selves that he was going anyway it's the same thing with you and i hallelujah so so the lord wanted peter to look because he wanted to take away the discouragement take away the disappointed on himself aren't you glad that our god's like that hallelujah but you've got to look amen john looked there up in the yo up in glory he was taken up in revelations 4 and 5. he looked he said there was no man found worthy but an elder came and said you know look again look again remember he had he had he had walked with jesus he had talked with jesus he was loved by jesus he had he had eaten with jesus seen many yeah the lord did many mighty things he saw jesus die he saw the tomb open he saw jesus resurrected but yet he had to look again because he was he was he you know he went much because no man was found worthy to open the book and read it let alone look upon and as his weeping one of the elders said basically look again you know the lord wants us to look again remember he is the answer to every problem he is the answer to every discouragement the answer to every pain and and the answer comes when when the lord reveals his word to you and i he brings comfort you know like the psalms mean a lot when you're going through something because it because beforehand you just read it saying oh that's a nice psalm but when you're going through the same pain you say that's a real nice psalm hallelujah or you know you see paul going through something trouble going on and you can really relate amen because you looked again but you see a deeper a deeper meaning something is a lot more comforting in it i mean so john john was told to look again and he was told look and you see the line of the tribe of judah and when he looked he saw the lamb of god same being amen and then his his weeping turned into rejoicing because he looked hallelujah so the one that he saw purchased salvation and and and rose from the grave is the same one that he saw walk from the eternities and take the book amen to to to claim everything that he purchased amen and if we can just look remember john looked at was looking for someone who was already there to do the job amen jesus did not appear like he wasn't there he was in the eternities and the seating but now he steps forth to take the book he was already up there right so if we can just look and and realize the lord has already done it he's already done it right that's why we're called to look amen amen aren't you glad like i just go back to the whole scapegoat again you know you're an israelite you realize the scapegoat's got to be given your burden your sin is still there it's been painful but your sin is still there but and you don't know the scapegoat's gone but someone will come to you say hold on no no it's being carried far away hallelujah so you mean it's not in the camp anymore no it's not in israel anymore no it's in the wilderness the la the goat's gone where did he go in the wilderness can we find him no we don't want to find him it's god has been carried far away you could rejoice if you're a real israelite say praise god my sins have been carried away amen it's already happened amen so the same thing with you and i if we can just look and realize the lord's taking care of it all not just a part of it the whole thing amen he's purchased our entire salvation amen he's purchased our healing amen he's purchased everything we have need of even the taking of the book it's happened amen now he's here to claim what he purchased which is you and i hallelujah you know brother brown would say here you know he would say many times the visions don't heal your faith heals you your faith in the finished work of calvary heals you he says visions just actually prove that he's here and he's still the living word but as far as healing you it doesn't it only lets you know he's here he's already healed you amen he'd say in a couple of places if jesus was standing on this platform in this suit and you came to and said can you heal me he says i'm sorry i can't i've already healed you i've already done it because many times we have in our mind lord can you do this for me he's already done it you just got in faith accept it and receive it hallelujah amen if you're sick you were healed when jesus was wounded for your transgressions amen with the stripes we are healed it's already been done we're not looking for our messiah to come and purchase our healing purchase our salvation purchase the salvation of our family and our loss your loved ones no it's already happened he's already done it amen we've just got to accept that he's done it hallelujah he says he says here to greater than solomon is here he says god if heaven knows both of us he knows why you're here he knows why i'm here but to know you i do not i have no idea what you're here for but if god of heaven will reveal it to me what you're here for will you believe me to be his prophet he says i could not heal you you know that but it'll only raise your faith to healing i mean so the healing's there but our faith needs to be raised to receive it so it's the same thing when we gather you know this should be every service should be a faith raising service no matter if it's teaching evangelism whatever it is pastoral ship it should be faith raising because the promises are there brother ram says that the holy ghost is pillow fires there in the meetings to to release our desires to us i mean to our desire to be free if we are desire to be healed i mean desire for our lovers to come and desire for more of god he's here to release that desire to us hallelujah amen he says here in resurrection of lazarus he says you know sometimes wonder how the lord feels about us sometime when he does um when he does so many things for us and yet we just sit like we're in like we're in a subconsciously don't we aren't we all guilty i am we just sit and say well lord i wish you'd do something for me this is what he's saying lordo who's who's been in that category i just put my own hand up lord i wish you'd do something for me he says he can't do nothing no more for us than what he's already done he's already healed us he's already saved us he's already given us joy he gives us his peace he's he's our shield our buckler everything that we have is in him and he's done paid the price of redemption to redeem us back as sons and daughters of god amen he says it's the only thing in the world that's left undone is physical death but that's going to be taken away he purchased the taking away of that but so really we should really realize you know you know the blood puts us in speaking terms with god amen well we can actually go before the throne of almighty god say father i have a need you've purchased it you've healed me you've saved my family but i've come in faith because i want to see it become manifested i mean i don't just want to be floating around and say yes but i want to see it become sight amen because that's really because remember he's purchased it it's like if someone bought me a house i've always wanted now i'm not putting out any thing enough but but i just want to give an illustration i was thinking how could i an illustration you could see the house you want and you say that's a perfect house for me and then you could say maybe see a for sale sign in front of it but you know you don't have the money in the bank to do it but then what if someone came along and well maybe the next day you come and you see a sold sticker on it no doubt there'd be a disappointment there because you're still enjoying the dream of you know but then it's sold but then what if what if a person came along and said now here's the keys to the house here's the case you know you would say it's the same thing with healing you you'd say but how's this so i haven't bought it i haven't purchased someone else did someone already bought it for you you don't have to go buy it it's already been bought here's the keys to possess the house now i could rejoice that the house is mine but i need to go and live in it well i need to believe that this key is what's needed to open the door to go into the house it's wonderful to talk about the house but when you're in the house when you put your furniture in when you live there that's a whole different thing on paper it's yours anyway right it's under my name there's the deed there's my name i am the possessor of this house on paper so on paper it's all the same we are possesses of eternal life all healing is ours redemption every blessing god died for it's here right on paper because remember this our names are uh in this book we have fallen heir to everything that jesus fell there too right but he's given us a key of faith to go in just like a key to a house we have a key of faith already it's already in us right and if you say lord increase my faith you say well here you go he it's already been purchased our rapture has been purchased the body changed the dead in christ resurrecting that's already been purchased everything you can imagine god doing it's already been purchased hallelujah so but he gives you the key but now you've got to take that key of faith put it in the door and unlock it now the key that opens every door is faith in the finished work of calvary brother bram says it's faith in the finished work of calvary now ask you the question has it become real to you that he died for you right has it become real to you that he carried your sins far away he died and he became a sinner that you could become like him amen he became sin that would become the very righteous of god through christ right so so we believe that eh we believe he rose again we believe his holy spirit is in us amen you can go back in your life and see we where you met him where his word become real he transformed your life you're now a new creature okay so if he's done all that then he'll do the rest hallelujah amen isn't that because he's the same god he doesn't say now well this offerings for this and then now this offerings for this and now this offerings for this you know so it's not like he said well i'll shed this blood here for salvation but not for healing and then i'll come and do this sacrifice and shed it for healing but not for the baptism of the holy ghost and now i'm going to do this here and then i'm going to do this one for overcoming power and then you've got to go through all these different sacrifices to receive the body change no it's one that's one so if he did it once for everything and he's become part of you and i he's given you the key of faith faith in the finished work of calvary because remember that opened up everything when he purchased our salvation he purchased our body change when he purchased our salvation no demon can stand before the church of god i mean when he purchased our salvation he unlocked the door for god to come and dwell in man again hallelujah when he purchased our salvation he was purchasing the resurrection of the dead saints past president future when he purchased our salvation he purchased the redemption of this whole world so he he he purchased by dropping his blood upon the earth he was actually claiming i'm going to put my new jerusalem right here i mean by purchasing our salvation he was he was actually purchasing this place he's going to burn the devils off you know a place that's unkept you've got to get a weed whacker out spray you just got to deal with it you know so god's not just going to spray the earth he's going to burn the atmosphere burn up the devils burn everything off it but that was purchased on calvary amen so now he's given us faith if he's given you faith to repent if he's given you faith to receive the holy ghost be baptized you know if there's any faith for that he's given you faith for all things you say well i don't feel i have the faith well then say lord help my unbelief i believe lord help my unbelief and he'll give it to you amen so now he has purchased all things for us all we need is a pure unadulterated faith in the word of god and the finished works that god required at calvary this isn't the token knowing that there is nothing we could do to save ourselves we just accept what he did for us abraham believed god was reputed for him for righteousness then god gave him the seal of circumcision as a token that he had received his faith there is a gospel now when we claim that we believe god then god will identify our faith pardon me will give us a token of the blood of the lord jesus that finished work that finished the work for us at calvary then our our life is his the life of our sacrifice is in us that's why it is it is finished amen it's done so now all we need and all we so you know the faith we have we actually stumble at the faith we have the blood was applied in israel i mean i mean there in egypt in the passover it was it was a common weed hyssop was a common weed so if we're in wellington you know i don't want to say this is a joke but you know if if the passover was happening in wellington he could say go get some ghosts or go get some blackberry it grows everywhere you have to go up some mountainside to find some rare little shrub and no faith is so common that we stumble over it the same faith that we use to turn on a light switch to turn on the light is the same faith we can actually use to approach god with but we stumble over we think we've got to work something up no no we just have to accept that he's already done it for us and walk into it amen so i'm just going to finish with this scripture here in romans 8. he says but we know this is romans 8 28 but we know that all but we know that to the ones wait hold on what okay i don't know what version i have here can you um can you put that up i can't even read the king james half the time how am i going to read this out loud now romans 8 i'm going to read from verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god and to them which are called according to his purpose this message calls us to his purpose right his purpose is rapture his purchases redemption has purchased the gathering of his bride what does the message do brother ram said the bridegroom call cut will come right through this what it's a call to a union so we we love him and we're called according to his purpose it's you know it's neat when you find yourself in the scripture amen and and he's the one who shows you yourself in the scripture i'm glad about that for whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren what is the image of his son his word so we are predicted to be conformed to the image of his word so in other words we become living bibles right amen moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified so notice it's not saying he will he has he has not well he has amen so we're not looking for all one day lord when's it no no he's already done it amen remember irrespective of how you feel about yourself see don't don't try and put what you think about yourself in front of what god has said about you what you take privacy abraham abraham could have said i'm old i'm real i feel old i'm acting old i'm old now i'm old and and he could have kept putting that in front of him you know in front of god's promise no i'm old i'm old i'm old but no he said no god your word's true it's true it's true you've promised it lord and he put what god said about him father of nations he put that above what he thought about himself alright no not more than thought actually his current life state which is far more than just thinking about it amen so so when it says moreover him also did predict now i'm just going back to verse 30. moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified he's already done it we've just got to step into it you know it's like oh lord can you heal me he already has healed me but by faith you accept he's already done it for you that's manifested in your life lord can you give me the holy ghost well he purchased it that you can receive the holy ghost amen it's already he's already paid for it lord can you save me he already saved you that down calvary it's already done we just gotta buy faith accept it it's so simple i think we go over the top of it oh lord i need to know you more well he purchased a way for you to know more just just just keep walking with god oh lord am i raps you're ready if you have the holy ghost in you you're ready for the rapture if you're sealed to the day of your redemption by the holy ghost not just anointed but he's in you you're ready amen well then what's the purpose of the rest of his life to build character to mature to have victories to give us more to praise him for over on the other side amen we're going to have eternity to give him glory that's why he gives us a whole bunch of testimonies to praise him for and it's not we're not gonna you know sometimes you think you know someone tells you a testament like christine you'll tell me a testimony something happened a few years ago in our lives i'm like really yeah oh yeah that happened that's right but me and my dumb mind i just forget things you know but on that side there'll be no done mine you remember it exactly all the details hallelujah what shall we say then to these things i don't know can it really no no no if god be for us then who can be against us amen he that spared not his own son but delivered up for us all how shall not he how shall not how shall he not with him also freely give us all things amen if he's already done that why don't you give us all things hallelujah so if god would be for me who can be against me that's why you've got to look at the one who's for you the world's not for you the devil's not for you social media is not for you your opinion is not for you your country is not for you he's for you so look unto him look that's all i can say and i was finished with that word look look and the more you look the happier you'll get the more you rejoice the more of his peace will come into your life you'll be more stable in your thinking and your actions everything you do because you look you say i'm going through the worst trial of my life i just say look he's the answer to every trouble he's he's the answer to every problem he's still a peace peace giver he's still a waymaker hey man he's still the light in the darkness he's the answer to every situation but just look remember faith this is i think it's just so simple but brother bram said it's all through his ministry faith in the finished work of calvary is what you need to receive every divine blessing right and if you've had faith to be saved then you have the faith for your loved ones your faith for healing your faith for the holy ghost because remember it's one sacrifice opens the whole thing so look don't be discouraged the devil doesn't want you to look but look look unto the lord where will it be manifested i don't know but be like abraham just keep looking just keep looking amen god answers prayer amen let's have the musicians uh this morning amen god bless you amen i want to look hallelujah amen praise the lord amen i'm so glad we can look are you thankful you know he's not like some shadow that hides no no he reveals himself he wants you to know him more i mean to his bride
