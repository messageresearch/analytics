[27:02] evening everyone
[27:03] so glad you could all come out on this
[27:05] typical spring evening god bless you
[27:09] appreciate it amen
[27:16] well if you got your Bibles handy let's
[27:18] go to 1st Peter 1 & 6
[27:30] just you've had a good start to the week
[27:33] and we know that everything we face in
[27:38] life God has has a plan and God has got
[27:42] it through so first Peter 1 and 6 sees
[27:45] here wherein you greatly rejoice though
[27:50] now for a season if need be
[27:53] yea and heaviness through manifold
[27:55] temptations that the trial of your faith
[27:59] being much more precious than that of
[28:02] gold that perisheth though it be tried
[28:05] with fire might be found unto the praise
[28:07] and honor and glory at the appearing of
[28:10] Jesus Christ whom having not seen you
[28:13] love and whom though you now see him not
[28:16] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[28:18] unspeakable and full of glory I trust
[28:20] you can say that's me receiving the end
[28:23] of your faith even the salvation of your
[28:25] souls Amen may Lord blesses word you may
[28:28] have your seats tonight I want to read
[28:32] that verse first Peter white and 7 from
[28:34] this is from the NIV normally I don't
[28:36] read other other versions but this is
[28:39] this is what it says it says these have
[28:43] come so that so the manifold temptations
[28:46] these have come so that the proven
[28:49] genuineness of your faith of Greater
[28:53] worth than gold which perishes
[28:55] even though refined by fire may result
[28:58] and praise glory and honor when Jesus
[29:01] Christ is revealed so it's the it's it's
[29:04] so that the genuineness of your faith is
[29:08] showing that's why a that's why the
[29:10] trial of your faith it's to prove if
[29:13] your faith is genuine or not you know we
[29:17] are living in an hour where God is
[29:19] separating from from the believers not
[29:23] people from people but he's taking our
[29:26] human part and our human reasoning a
[29:28] human ideas and separating it from us to
[29:32] really bring forth what's in us you know
[29:34] this message identifies two seeds it
[29:37] identifies God's children and identify
[29:40] God's children
[29:42] and it feels that I believe by grace
[29:43] where all the children of God I trust I
[29:46] trust you can say yes I'm one of him and
[29:48] so now so this message is calling the
[29:53] bride to her bridegroom and so now it is
[29:58] this message reveals really what is in
[30:00] us even though we are not aware of it
[30:01] when we were born but the Prophet tells
[30:04] us that we had a gene seed within our
[30:08] soul that was placed in there before the
[30:09] foundation of the world and that may
[30:11] have laid dormant for maybe many years
[30:13] maybe not many years but in your season
[30:15] in your time God God brought that seed
[30:17] to life and God quickened you and God
[30:20] spoke to you and God's drawn you and the
[30:22] reason he's done that is because there's
[30:24] a seat there but their seed has to come
[30:26] to life and he wants to now prove what
[30:29] is placed now Abraham so this word trial
[30:34] it means a testing there's in the Greek
[30:37] this word trial it means testing about
[30:39] implication or trustworthiness a trial
[30:42] or a trying now Abraham we are the
[30:45] children of Abraham by faith Amen we are
[30:48] the children of Abraham and so Abraham
[30:50] it says in Hebrews 11 and 17 it says by
[30:54] faith Abraham when he was tried offered
[30:56] up Isaac that he that he that had
[30:59] received the promises offered up his
[31:01] only begotten son now this would try it
[31:04] means to scrutinize it means to si to
[31:09] examine and this word si here yo there's
[31:16] something called an essay or an asset
[31:17] test where we're a geologist we'll take
[31:20] a column of rock take take big columns
[31:22] of rock and they will take that and
[31:24] they'll take sections of it and they'll
[31:27] pull put it in a thing called a ball
[31:28] mill they'll crash it to powder then
[31:30] they'll examine what's in the rock and
[31:32] so this is what Abraham he went through
[31:34] this essay test this great test where he
[31:37] was reduced to powder because God was
[31:39] going to examine down to the detail what
[31:41] sinew Abraham what sin you what's been
[31:44] placed in you Abraham because you know
[31:46] many times it's not us or not rather God
[31:49] wants to show what's in you I mean when
[31:52] we can look back and say I overcame God
[31:55] help me over
[31:55] come this test and God and I was going
[31:58] through a trial and I didn't know that
[32:00] where I was going but my sheep hear my
[32:02] voice is stranger and I'll follow and I
[32:05] followed his voice and and it says in
[32:07] the scripture though we walk through the
[32:09] valley of the shadow of death I'll fear
[32:10] no evil for thou rod my staff they
[32:13] comfort me
[32:14] I mean so many times he lead us because
[32:16] he leads us every day of our lives
[32:18] really cautious of it or not
[32:20] and so he wants us to look back at our
[32:22] life and say God helped me caused me to
[32:25] overcome in that trial and even if I
[32:28] fail that's not him that falls at him
[32:29] that gets back up and says Lord try me
[32:32] one more time I'm sure we've all been
[32:34] there a few times you find yourself face
[32:36] down on the on the mat and the boxing
[32:39] ring and you're saying you your opponent
[32:40] Satan and many times actually yourself
[32:42] you find yourself you know you've been
[32:44] you've been knocked out and then you
[32:47] come to yourself and say how did it come
[32:49] to this but then you say Lord try me
[32:51] again I want to go another round
[32:53] hallelujah I'm not satisfied with being
[32:56] defeated by this thing whether it's the
[32:58] enemy or yourself
[32:59] you know that you're the Prophet tells
[33:01] us Satan was defeated at Calvary so our
[33:04] greatest enemy you have is you brother
[33:07] BAM says the grace enemy I have is
[33:08] William Branham if I can get him out of
[33:10] the way I think God can do things I know
[33:11] nothing about I mean so now abraham was
[33:16] essayed he was s8 he was tried
[33:20] hallelujah and he came forth as gold
[33:22] because he is willing the blessing that
[33:24] he received he is willing to give it
[33:26] back now the root word of this word
[33:30] tried actually comes from a word through
[33:33] the idea of piercing amen so so so when
[33:37] your tribe is actually a piercing goes
[33:39] on I mean when your hardship or God
[33:42] Himself he Pierce's you I mean through
[33:44] the trial remember trials aren't yo it
[33:46] says count it all joy how can I count
[33:49] this joy and being pierced I'm being s8
[33:51] I'm being I'm being crushed to powder
[33:53] I'm being examined hallelujah it's not
[33:57] an easy thing
[33:58] amen yeah you may look I might be going
[34:01] through a trial and you may look at it
[34:03] say that's nothing but it could be it
[34:05] could be big to me and of it and and and
[34:07] vice versa because godly
[34:09] ages children in a specific way because
[34:12] he wants to bring us forth as gold I'm
[34:14] so glad that's the case so it comes
[34:16] through the idea of piercing this test
[34:19] Amen to to essay us because he wants to
[34:24] prove the genuine of our faith let's go
[34:30] to John chapter 6 because I want to I
[34:37] want to ask the question tonight I think
[34:40] I think I asked many questions but I
[34:42] want to ask you this question how
[34:44] genuine is your faith why why have you
[34:47] become a believer why are you here I'm
[34:50] not talking about these four walls I'm
[34:51] talking about walking with the revealed
[34:53] word of the hour why have you come to
[34:54] him why have you gathered why have you
[34:58] gathered to him many gathered to the son
[35:01] of man in his first coming they gathered
[35:04] to him but their motives weren't pure
[35:06] all of them some of them had pure
[35:09] motives many didn't have pure motives
[35:12] and Jesus said some things and did some
[35:18] things because he wanted to prove the
[35:20] genius of their faith and it goes all
[35:23] the way from the multitude to the
[35:25] seventeenth to the twelve and they came
[35:29] a test
[35:30] don't don't misunderstand me - no please
[35:34] because even Peter Peter got assayed
[35:37] Peter got tested because there's a part
[35:40] of him that he was still very much alive
[35:41] but there's a part of him where God
[35:43] revealed that crisis only living God but
[35:47] the human but had to go away because
[35:49] when you si for gold when you're looking
[35:51] for golf you know when you when you get
[35:52] a whole bunch you are out of the ground
[35:54] that not all that is gold not all yo it
[35:58] could be a big massive boulders just a
[36:00] little bit of gold I mean but but the
[36:02] miners they know that God's there and
[36:04] they'll do anything they know it's worth
[36:06] it to get the gold out it's the same
[36:08] thing with God he looks over the earth
[36:09] maybe you're a part of earth you're a
[36:11] part of the earth and he found you it
[36:14] begins the SAU because there's some gold
[36:17] in there that he wants he doesn't want
[36:19] the human but he wants the good he wants
[36:21] himself in you
[36:22] wit come forth as gold hallelujah so you
[36:26] know when we're when were battling
[36:28] through something it seems like we just
[36:31] kind of almost just in the gravel on the
[36:33] side of the highway and well you know I
[36:35] mean there's a ravine and you're just
[36:36] kind of holding on while he's driving
[36:38] anyway but you should just be happy Lord
[36:40] you're dealing with me thank you I'm
[36:42] glad you're dealing with me
[36:44] amen because it's good if he's dealing
[36:46] with you because he has a purpose in
[36:49] doing it now John 6 and where are we
[36:52] we're in verse 22 it says here the day
[37:00] following when the people were on the
[37:02] other side of the sea saw that there was
[37:04] none other boat there save one where and
[37:07] to his disciples were entered and that
[37:09] Jesus went not with his disciples into
[37:12] the boat but that his disciples were
[37:13] gone away alone howbeit there came other
[37:16] boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
[37:19] where he did eat bread after the Lord
[37:21] had given for thanks when the people
[37:24] wherefore saw that Jesus was not there
[37:26] neither his disciples they also took
[37:29] ships they also took shipping and came
[37:32] to Capernaum seeking for Jesus and when
[37:34] they had found him on the other side of
[37:36] the sea they said unto him rabbi when
[37:38] camest thou jesus answered them and said
[37:41] fairly Vili I said to you you seek me
[37:44] not because you saw the miracles but
[37:47] because you did eat of the loaves and
[37:49] were filled labor not for the meat which
[37:51] perishes but for the meat which endureth
[37:53] unto everlasting life which the Son of
[37:57] man hath given unto you for he hath God
[38:00] for he hath God the Father sealed shall
[38:06] and then then they then said and him
[38:09] what shall we do that we might work the
[38:12] works of God many people ask the same
[38:14] question today jesus answered and said
[38:16] this is the work of God that ye believe
[38:18] on whom he hath sent so here was a bunch
[38:22] of people here was the Messiah they came
[38:26] for food this is why they gathered to
[38:28] him they're the reason they gathered to
[38:31] him it wasn't out of because here's the
[38:34] lamb here's
[38:35] ridhima he's the one who's going to
[38:37] purchase my salvation on Calvary's tree
[38:39] he's the one who can set me free from
[38:41] darkness now I just want food so there
[38:44] so their motive of coming it wasn't a
[38:47] genuine but now God's know Jesus is
[38:49] going to prove the generous of their
[38:50] faith because they believe he could do
[38:52] it again they had some kind of faith in
[38:54] him but it's just a human faith and so
[38:58] and then and then we can continue
[39:01] reading down but we won't read the whole
[39:03] chapter but then then Jesus begins to
[39:06] speak about eating in flesh and drinking
[39:08] his blood and he started with about
[39:11] 5,000 people there and they're there at
[39:14] the side of John chapter 6 he ends up
[39:16] with 12 after after one service because
[39:20] he's asking the question now why have
[39:21] you come you've just come four loaves
[39:24] and fishes and then he says yeah and
[39:27] then even the seventy that he that he
[39:28] ordained to do supernatural miracles
[39:30] they left him and it says in the
[39:32] scriptures that many of his disciples
[39:34] walked with him no more so now they're
[39:36] going through an essay why what why why
[39:41] have you gathered to the Son of Man in
[39:43] this hour Jesus Christ who is the
[39:45] message of the hour why have you come I
[39:47] just I really want to want you to think
[39:49] about this what is my mode of an
[39:52] objective people have a lot of motives
[39:56] people gathered to Jesus you take Judas
[39:59] he was a thief he had the money bag he
[40:03] wanted to get rich this was his before
[40:06] coming he had a motive some people want
[40:10] to come because they want to have a
[40:11] great name or they want some kind of
[40:13] name and that's why they come some
[40:16] people want popularity some people want
[40:18] money what's your motive for coming have
[40:22] you ever thought about it what is your
[40:26] motive some people just want to
[40:28] influence on some people they want to do
[40:29] another thing but what's your motive
[40:31] only John only only the Gospel of John
[40:34] says that Judas was a thief and because
[40:37] of the prophetic anointing on that
[40:39] gospel had actually showed what was in
[40:41] the man it's got a Deuteronomy chapter 8
[40:43] and 2
[40:50] there's a reason why we go through
[40:52] things in life there's the reason why
[40:55] Trials come deuteronomy Adin Adin 1
[41:04] we'll go down to verse 3 to fix that
[41:10] this is Moses speaking now they've been
[41:13] journeying 40 years this is his last
[41:16] address to the people of Israel and he's
[41:19] going to show them why they went through
[41:21] everything I went through God needs to
[41:23] show us sometimes why did I go through
[41:25] this why did I suffer this Y is actually
[41:27] life seem to be harder since I being a
[41:29] believer since when I was in the world
[41:30] why is it more challenges why is there
[41:33] more struggles why is there it's because
[41:35] you're going through an essay because
[41:36] the genuineness of your faith is being
[41:39] tried it's being proven and because God
[41:43] is not a saying or testing you to show
[41:45] that you're a that that your wasn't
[41:48] fool's gold you know you know these rock
[41:50] that looks like gold that's called
[41:51] fool's gold
[41:52] God doesn't put you through a trial to
[41:54] say hey you're actually fool's gold he
[41:56] puts you through a trial to show you
[41:57] you're a real gold and you're the
[41:59] highest grade of gold there is
[42:01] hallelujah this that's why he allows you
[42:04] to go through things he wants to show
[42:05] you I trust that the genuineness of your
[42:08] faith is a hundred percent genuine
[42:09] you're here with a pure motive pure
[42:12] objective I've heard his voice in this
[42:14] our baby I'm jumping ahead of myself too
[42:16] far but I don't want you to feel like oh
[42:18] bit of a slump why am I here I don't
[42:20] really like this kind of thing but I
[42:21] want you to see when you see when you
[42:23] see your life and where you've been and
[42:25] where you're going
[42:25] God wants to prove what's in you Satan I
[42:29] told you they were gold and look at them
[42:30] they're shining like the Sun hallelujah
[42:33] they're shining like me they look like
[42:34] me Alleluia hey it makes makes parents
[42:38] real proud when they see their children
[42:40] they look just like me and they act just
[42:42] like me now they can be good or bad but
[42:44] hey Alleluia with God there's no bad
[42:47] characteristic so you know Deuteronomy
[42:50] 18 1 all the commandments which I
[42:52] commanded thee this day shall ye observe
[42:55] to do that you may live and multiply and
[42:58] go in and possess the land which the
[43:00] Lord
[43:01] we're unto your father's and thou shalt
[43:03] remember all the way which the LORD thy
[43:05] God led thee these 40 years in the
[43:07] wilderness to Humble thee and to prove
[43:11] thee to know what is in thine heart oh
[43:14] this is why Trials come whether thou
[43:17] could escape his Commandments or not and
[43:19] he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[43:21] hunger and fed thee with manna which
[43:23] thou knewest not neither did thy fathers
[43:26] know that he might make thee know that
[43:28] man does not live by bread only but by
[43:32] every word that proceedeth out of the
[43:34] mouth of the Lord
[43:35] Duffman live by raiment wax not old upon
[43:39] me neither did thy foot swell these
[43:42] forty years
[43:43] thou shalt also consider a 9 heart that
[43:45] as man chest either says son so the LORD
[43:49] thy God chastises thee hallelujah
[43:53] therefore thou shalt keep the
[43:55] commandments of the LORD thy God to walk
[43:56] in his ways and to fear Him Alleluia
[44:00] then no that's not a terror but a
[44:01] reverential fear and Trust that's what
[44:03] the word fear means
[44:04] amen so now he's so saying now this is
[44:07] why you went through the wilderness this
[44:10] is why you're in slavery this is why you
[44:12] went through the Red Sea this is why
[44:14] after the rich City you came to the
[44:16] waters of Marah which were bitter that's
[44:18] why he had no food in the wilderness and
[44:19] I sent manner and all the different
[44:21] things that happened that's why when the
[44:23] enemy came against you you know I fought
[44:25] your battles for you I proved myself and
[44:28] I proved what was in you because when
[44:30] the pressure came on now what were the
[44:33] people going to do there are a couple
[44:35] there that are Joshua and Caleb said
[44:37] we're more than able to take the land
[44:38] only because here was the trial the
[44:41] trial of their faith now the genuineness
[44:43] many people that said a mixed multitude
[44:45] left Egypt a mixed multitude win with
[44:48] Moses and so there would have been
[44:51] people there they went for whatever
[44:53] reason they went but there are a few
[44:56] that sit remember what our grandfather
[44:58] Abraham or great-great-great whatever
[45:00] grandfather Abraham said we're going to
[45:03] a promised land and God will send a
[45:05] deliverer and he's here and that's that
[45:07] man there Moses that's the fulfillment
[45:09] of the scripture and he's taking and God
[45:11] will take us into the Promised Land
[45:13] let's go
[45:14] hallelujah and they went and it was and
[45:18] then he came the pressure now can they
[45:20] take the land can or not take the land
[45:22] and ten spies said no to said yes and
[45:25] God was with the - hallelujah one was
[45:28] called Caleb and Caleb I think his name
[45:30] it means a dog
[45:31] Amen he was he wasn't didn't have some
[45:35] great princely name but he comes he says
[45:38] Here I am
[45:39] I want this mountain the genuine of
[45:43] genuineness of his faith was tried and
[45:46] proven he genuinely believed the promise
[45:48] he generated believed he was called he
[45:51] generally believed that there was a
[45:52] possession the land for him
[45:53] each any we believe God will give it to
[45:55] him and he genuinely believed that
[45:57] wherever he would walk Amen God would
[45:59] give him the victory and and it happened
[46:03] how lujah and was under the blood of
[46:05] bulls and goats not even under the blood
[46:07] of Jesus Christ amen and they conquered
[46:10] you know he took his position and there
[46:13] he was his faith was proven to be
[46:16] genuine hallelujah so now God God
[46:23] gathers God gathers his children he
[46:26] proves what's in them so there's a
[46:29] reason why we go through hardship and
[46:31] trial because he God really wants to
[46:33] prove what is it 9 heart and is not in
[46:35] the good times where we can really prove
[46:38] if we're believers or not the good times
[46:41] really we can be on the mountaintop
[46:43] shouting and rejoicing having a glorious
[46:45] time but it's really we're in the
[46:47] valleys ever in the battles ever in the
[46:50] hardship that's really where God can
[46:52] show you this is what's in you you know
[46:54] the believer you know if you're a
[46:56] believer tonight everything you have
[46:58] need of us in you by the new birth
[47:01] everything you have need of your fully
[47:03] equipped you just don't know what's in
[47:05] you you don't know what the power you
[47:07] know I know when God God really got a
[47:09] hold of me I didn't fully know what was
[47:11] going on I knew he called me I knew I
[47:13] knew he was leading me to fully
[47:15] surrender to him and you he transformed
[47:18] me but that's all I didn't really know
[47:19] too much apart from apathy begins to
[47:21] open his word and take you through
[47:23] experiences like David David's faith was
[47:26] proven to be genuine
[47:27] he was a man now this is genuine faith
[47:30] God will take care of my enemies God
[47:33] will take care of everything
[47:34] soul soul was still kindly minded the
[47:38] Spirit of God was with Saul and with
[47:39] David but he still calmly minded he was
[47:42] scared he used fear to try and keep his
[47:44] kingdom together
[47:45] he used fear to bring the men of Israel
[47:48] together to fight you know and he was
[47:51] worried because he believed you know
[47:53] Samuel said that the kingdoms taken from
[47:55] you and now he's living in fear and now
[47:58] he's trying to kill his opposition all
[47:59] these things David wasn't like that
[48:01] he was angry at the man who claimed that
[48:03] he killed Saul on the battlefield
[48:05] how deed had killed the Lord's anointed
[48:07] you'll lose your life you know he was he
[48:10] was angry he was angry at these ones he
[48:12] could have killed him a few times you
[48:14] know the story but he was a man with
[48:16] genuine faith I'll take care of my enemy
[48:19] God will take care of them there's a
[48:22] reason why I'm on the run from them
[48:24] God's wanting to prove and gods won't
[48:26] approve what sin you amen sometimes
[48:30] sometimes we defeat our enemy sometimes
[48:33] we have to run from our enemy Paul went
[48:36] into a city smote a man blind and then
[48:39] and then a couple of cities later
[48:40] there's a coppersmith he says beware
[48:42] this coppersmith he's talking to one of
[48:44] the disciples he did be much how he
[48:46] drove now the city sometimes it happens
[48:50] that way do you know your New Testament
[48:53] so different things happen but God
[48:58] really wants to prove now do you know
[48:59] what's in you do you understand it's not
[49:03] a like David he used the sling against
[49:05] Goliath you never use the sling again he
[49:09] had a sword or he had a different kind
[49:10] of weapon and sometimes God said go
[49:12] attack them here at the time he said no
[49:14] do something else and God was showing
[49:16] him he was leading him in different ways
[49:18] because we because he wants to prove
[49:20] himself in different ways you know God
[49:22] doesn't just control alt delete' he
[49:25] leads us in a different ways you
[49:28] understand he's not just one hit wonder
[49:30] this is one-trick pony kind of thing but
[49:32] he leads us in different ways because he
[49:33] wants to show you that mean but we are
[49:36] his disciple are we no and a disciple is
[49:39] made by doing
[49:41] not by theory it's by practical
[49:43] experience you become a disciple I Luis
[49:46] that's why he takes you through trials
[49:47] and hardship because he's making your
[49:49] disciple he wants to prove himself in
[49:51] this situation and in this situation in
[49:54] this situation and he's also willing to
[49:56] prove now now how are you going to treat
[49:58] the other person how you gonna treat the
[50:01] other person because the enemy oh you
[50:04] know David said you know David said Oh
[50:09] God will take care of them and many
[50:12] times our enemies carnally they're our
[50:15] enemies but in reality they're our
[50:17] friends and the devil's got us shooting
[50:19] each other instead of shooting the devil
[50:22] amen
[50:23] and brother Brown speaks about zeals now
[50:26] we need wisdom and the seller problem
[50:29] says he says about zeal he says he says
[50:32] people get too zealous actually they
[50:34] actually cause denominational splits
[50:36] they fight for their denomination so
[50:38] much because they're so zealous that
[50:40] they actually hurt other brethren we say
[50:44] we're not a denomination we can still be
[50:46] too zealous in the wrong way zeal
[50:49] without wisdom is not as it's just like
[50:52] a rapid fire and I'll hit something as
[50:55] long as I hit something but it's not
[50:57] ways because there's too much blue on
[51:01] blue you know shooting the same side but
[51:05] my my course is just that God won't say
[51:08] hold on hold on
[51:10] you got a I want to teach you some
[51:12] wisdom don't fly off the trigger too
[51:15] quickly yeah he needs
[51:17] David was showing David was spirit lead
[51:21] he didn't just kill Saul he didn't just
[51:24] come against his enemy no he didn't know
[51:25] God will take care of that amen
[51:30] you follow I think I'm and they were men
[51:34] that gathered to David and their faith
[51:37] they believed he was coming to power and
[51:40] you know there is a story there but now
[51:42] our faith has to be proven genuine the
[51:49] Apostle Peter
[51:52] let's go to let's go to John 6 if you're
[51:55] still there let's go back there
[52:11] John sixin and 66 so Jesus is already
[52:18] spoken about at least you drink my flesh
[52:20] eat my blood you have no life in you you
[52:22] know he says these things basically if I
[52:24] left them and then from that time many
[52:27] of his disciples went back and walked no
[52:28] more with them then said Jesus unto the
[52:31] twelve will ye also go away now listen
[52:37] to this great eloquence of declaration
[52:39] of faith the in Simon Peter answered him
[52:42] Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the
[52:45] words of eternal life and we believe and
[52:47] assure that thou art that Christ the Son
[52:50] of the Living God that sounds like a
[52:52] good confession of faith but then Jesus
[52:55] just looked at them and jesus answered
[52:58] them said have not I chosen you twelve
[53:00] and one of you is the devil so he was is
[53:05] Jesus basically said no no no no the
[53:08] disciples are basically saying we will
[53:10] not how can we leave you you have the
[53:13] words of eternal life
[53:15] we can't where else can we go we'll
[53:17] never leave you Jesus and you think that
[53:19] Jesus say good on your boys I'm proud of
[53:21] you I knew you had it in you I knew you
[53:24] were you know when I called you I knew
[53:26] that you had come all the way he didn't
[53:27] say anything like that
[53:29] he said have I not chosen you who want
[53:32] of you as a devil and he just left it
[53:34] like that because he wanted to prove the
[53:35] genuineness of their faith now we
[53:39] understand the next verse he says he
[53:41] spoke Judas Iscariot the son of Simon
[53:43] for he for he it was that should betray
[53:46] him being one of the twelve
[53:47] now here's Peter thou art the Christ of
[53:50] so loving God when he's asked ya when
[53:53] Jesus asked his disciples and Matthew 16
[53:55] who demean say that I am he says who do
[53:58] you say that I am he was the only one
[54:00] that said at that at the crisis a Living
[54:02] God and probably would have felt maybe
[54:04] proud himself all good hallelujah I gave
[54:07] the right because it's his blessed art
[54:08] thou simon barjona ho the Messiah said
[54:11] I'm blessed got what over you John
[54:14] something you know he would have felt
[54:16] proud in himself that part had to go
[54:19] because this human face and his revealed
[54:23] faith
[54:24] and the revealed faith because we mean
[54:26] to live by the faith of Jesus Christ by
[54:29] the faith his faith in us it's how we
[54:31] live it's not here it's not faith this
[54:34] is not a play on words it's not our
[54:37] faith is not meant to be now I got to
[54:40] get this right because I get things
[54:41] mixed up all the time we mean to live by
[54:43] the faith of the Son of God Paul says by
[54:46] his faith we mean to live the just shall
[54:48] live by faith which is the faith of God
[54:51] himself
[54:52] and youth it's not meant to be human
[54:54] faith in Him
[54:55] it's meant to be revealed faith in him
[54:58] right faith cometh by hearing and
[55:00] hearing by the Word of God every person
[55:03] in the world has human faith even the
[55:05] Atheist beliefs well 10 billion whatever
[55:08] a million years ago you know in a deep
[55:11] sea hydrothermal vent there was there
[55:14] was active there was a porous column
[55:17] made by the volcanic activity which came
[55:19] out and it made iron sulfur sites and
[55:22] then organic compounds came and they
[55:24] bonded these iron sulfur sites and then
[55:26] eventually amino acids came it's
[55:29] actually what they believed I studied at
[55:31] uni I know I'm talking about they
[55:33] actually believe that's true
[55:35] that's what they believe but they can't
[55:38] prove it in the lab so what happens
[55:42] there's an element of faith and they and
[55:45] they won't they're not willing to go
[55:47] down to that part of the beginning
[55:49] because their own science disproves it
[55:52] so I'll go to a basic single-cell
[55:54] organism they're multiplying whatever
[55:57] evolution but they won't go to the
[55:58] beginning because they can't prove it
[56:00] will say well that requires faith
[56:02] because they have to because they can't
[56:04] prove it they have to believe it's
[56:05] happened so every human being has a
[56:07] faith but it is human faith it is not
[56:11] revealed faith well what does reveal
[56:14] faith when God speaks to your heart and
[56:16] it becomes more than just something in
[56:17] here do you understand what that is when
[56:21] God speaks to you when God speaks units
[56:24] more than just in here but it's in here
[56:26] something happens to you that is now God
[56:28] revealing himself to you that is
[56:31] revealed faith hallelujah so now but
[56:34] Peter he had he had human faith
[56:37] and then he had revealed faith but then
[56:40] now when the pressure came on him God
[56:43] was going to si him to bring forth that
[56:47] a revealed faith and get rid of the
[56:49] human faith because Peter went through a
[56:53] great trial are you following me so far
[56:56] because remember Peter said we'll die
[56:58] with you I'll die with you Lord you know
[57:01] took the sword Jesus saw the vision of a
[57:03] man here getting cut off do we ever
[57:05] sword we've got to or wine or whatever
[57:06] Jesus is it's enough Peter give me that
[57:09] sword
[57:10] I'm just dramatizing John Andrew I'll
[57:12] take the sword big fisherman big rugged
[57:14] fisherman he's going to pack this thing
[57:16] to this fight that may happen and here
[57:19] he is maybe no doubt with the flourish
[57:21] draws it I'll protect you Jesus he can't
[57:24] use a sword so he cuts the man's ear off
[57:26] and said of the head because it just
[57:28] swings it wildly Peter Jesus stop and
[57:31] maybe Peters in the heat of the moment
[57:33] what do you mean I'm defending the faith
[57:36] that's how some people are I'm going to
[57:39] defend the faith against these heathens
[57:40] this message is true this is how it
[57:43] should be this is the doctrine I'll
[57:44] defend the faith they just cut off
[57:46] someone's here so they can't hear it
[57:47] anymore God these Jesus needs to heal
[57:49] that wound I trust I'm not looking at
[57:52] any Peters tonight it's true isn't it
[57:56] cuz of zeal with no wisdom so now and
[58:00] then Jesus put the sword away heals a
[58:02] man's ear and then and then all the
[58:05] disciples fled and I may be wrong but
[58:08] from reading the from being the Gospels
[58:10] maybe this is a test was Peter the only
[58:13] one that went to where the trial was
[58:15] this is now was Peter the only one that
[58:19] went to outside where the trial of Jesus
[58:22] was was he the only one was he more than
[58:25] one other disciples well here's the only
[58:29] one question that I know of but here he
[58:31] was he's here he's one is they where
[58:34] where Jesus is and then a woman comes
[58:37] along aren't you one of those disciples
[58:39] of Jesus no I don't know him he comes a
[58:42] trial of his faith he was struggling
[58:44] with a sword thing he's doing the right
[58:45] thing but now he's on he doesn't know
[58:47] what's going on this pride this human
[58:49] pride that he has religion
[58:51] message pride must die and now he's
[58:55] gonna be s8 and he buckles under the
[58:58] questioning he doesn't stand for the
[59:00] faith anymore and he any denies of Jesus
[59:03] tells him you'll deny me thrice and P
[59:07] doesn't Peter basically without saying
[59:09] it he says I don't believe you cuz he
[59:12] didn't he didn't say no lord please I
[59:14] don't have to do that you know he
[59:16] basically said no I'll never do that in
[59:18] his heart this is me this is the Gospel
[59:19] according to Ben coloring in the picture
[59:22] I hope it's still part of the picture in
[59:23] the lines but he said within himself
[59:25] basically I won't deny you and now here
[59:27] comes the pressure on he denies him
[59:29] three times
[59:29] sui's doing it because he's a human
[59:32] pride a human faith that must go
[59:36] hallelujah
[59:37] but then now but they no but there's a
[59:41] good place to be because what if what if
[59:44] Jesus just let Peter go on like this he
[59:48] couldn't be the spokesman for in the
[59:49] book of Acts he couldn't be used by the
[59:51] Lord
[59:52] that's why trials and you know that's
[59:53] why the Lord looks down into you you
[59:55] know you open the word and he puts his
[59:57] finger on your life there's this pride
[59:59] there's this arrogancy this is this and
[1:00:01] this and this and this and you say oh
[1:00:03] god take it from me well you can only do
[1:00:06] that we ask him and you can only do it
[1:00:09] when he shows you because we have we're
[1:00:12] we're you know horses got blinders on
[1:00:15] you see if I see a horse like this their
[1:00:17] vision is like this now horses are prey
[1:00:19] animal with their eyes are on the side
[1:00:21] the hits that they can see quite a lot
[1:00:23] then the blinkers just they can only see
[1:00:25] this much this is like us walking along
[1:00:28] in life how lujah I'm a believer but
[1:00:32] then sometimes God and then there's all
[1:00:34] the stuff here you don't see it they can
[1:00:37] be pride jealousy small man syndrome
[1:00:39] small woman syndrome and comforta land
[1:00:41] your own skin whatever you want to put
[1:00:44] there can be right here and can be
[1:00:46] affecting your whole life then one day
[1:00:48] he goes like this and you see this big
[1:00:50] horror story I have I really been like
[1:00:53] this for so long oh god take it from me
[1:00:56] but before but before he takes the
[1:00:58] blinker off you're just walking along
[1:01:02] Alleluia isn't he good
[1:01:05] he's so gracious because he shows member
[1:01:08] he he doesn't show us things in our
[1:01:10] lives to basically give us a death
[1:01:13] sentence by that thing
[1:01:14] he shows us to take it from us
[1:01:18] Alleluia so now here he is and then and
[1:01:23] then the you know then Jesus crucified
[1:01:25] he bodies put in the tomb the woman go
[1:01:28] to the tomb and they come back saying
[1:01:30] he's risen and his people but then Jesus
[1:01:32] says go tell my disciples and Peter he
[1:01:36] must have been pretty happy when he
[1:01:37] heard those words and Peter huh I'm so
[1:01:39] thank you Lord because you'd think cuz
[1:01:41] cuz he went and worked when and wept
[1:01:43] bitterly when he heard the crow and
[1:01:46] I think he saw Jesus when Jesus walked
[1:01:48] out and his mind went back where Jesus
[1:01:50] said you'll deny me three times
[1:01:51] and his heart would have God like a lead
[1:01:53] balloon I've failed them I've really
[1:01:57] failed them the oh I've gone too far
[1:01:59] there's a man there was a man Judas he
[1:02:02] went too far but he hung himself he
[1:02:07] didn't you know he should have gone to
[1:02:10] Pentecost he really should have gone to
[1:02:13] Peter cost but Jesus I mean Peter
[1:02:17] somehow somehow he knew there's more
[1:02:22] somehow I can still be maybe forgiven if
[1:02:25] I see him again and then they're fishing
[1:02:29] in Galilee there's a man on the on the
[1:02:32] seashore have you caught any fish
[1:02:34] children and in John looks over at Peter
[1:02:38] or not maybe one of them says no we
[1:02:40] haven't caught anything and then he says
[1:02:42] put your net on the other side of the
[1:02:44] boat maybe I thought we've done there
[1:02:47] for office okay we'll do it
[1:02:49] say yo so they throw they know on the
[1:02:50] other side hundred I think the Bible
[1:02:52] says like a hundred and fifty three fish
[1:02:54] God is in detail hallelujah
[1:02:57] and then John looks at sister Peter it's
[1:03:00] the Lord and then Peter puts up the
[1:03:03] member he's bowed down by this his own
[1:03:06] condemnation I've denied him I've done
[1:03:10] wrong and it's great I'll win it when he
[1:03:12] needed me I failed I failed bitterly
[1:03:16] unjust fell a little bit I do
[1:03:18] I just failed miserably I buckled under
[1:03:22] questioning of woman and in those days
[1:03:24] woman were second-class citizens in
[1:03:26] Israel he buckled under questioning a
[1:03:28] woman he couldn't even stand there
[1:03:30] saying yes I wasn't your I am his
[1:03:31] disciple but then he sees him on the on
[1:03:34] the seashore he puts on his Fisher's
[1:03:36] coat and he begins swimming
[1:03:39] hallelujah he's a man God knows how to
[1:03:42] humiliate us sometimes we have to be
[1:03:45] humiliated in order of him to separate
[1:03:48] to 2si us hallelujah because we are we
[1:03:52] would Naaman the powers resurrection but
[1:03:54] the likeness of his sufferings hey Jesus
[1:03:57] was hanging on a cross and he was naked
[1:03:59] before the people he was humiliated that
[1:04:02] day and there's a part of that suffering
[1:04:05] and humiliation for us but there's a
[1:04:08] reason for it and see here comes Peter
[1:04:11] with his weight of condemnation he comes
[1:04:14] he just comes to him hallelujah he just
[1:04:17] comes to him and then Jesus begins to
[1:04:22] speak to him to one side Peter do you
[1:04:27] love me now here's the genuineness of
[1:04:29] faith here's the genuine you say well
[1:04:32] how do i how do you know because i've
[1:04:35] throw it out a lot of questions well how
[1:04:37] do you know your faith is genuine well
[1:04:39] Peters being asked a question and
[1:04:42] Peter's being asked this question by
[1:04:44] Jesus himself do you love me and to me
[1:04:49] if you have genuine love and whom you
[1:04:51] have genuine faith if you genuinely love
[1:04:54] him then your faith will be genuine amen
[1:04:58] your faith will be genuine if you love
[1:05:00] him he says Lord I love you he says feed
[1:05:04] my sheep and then feed my lambs and then
[1:05:05] the third question Peter just says Lord
[1:05:07] you know I love you you know my heart
[1:05:10] hallelujah
[1:05:12] so Peter went through an essay he went
[1:05:17] through a great essay and Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:05:21] and his disciples don't change either so
[1:05:26] he allows these to happen because he's
[1:05:29] really look at you
[1:05:31] and he's asking you the question do you
[1:05:32] love me as your faith genuine that the
[1:05:36] genuineness of your faith will be tried
[1:05:38] or be proven that's the great question
[1:05:43] in this day because if you have genuine
[1:05:46] for him then you'll have genuine faith
[1:05:48] because if you genuinely love him not
[1:05:51] humanly but divine love comes in because
[1:05:55] here's that the whole the holy God the
[1:05:57] love of God is she'd abroad in our
[1:05:59] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[1:06:01] unto us and that love is not human love
[1:06:03] that varies worth worth with condition
[1:06:07] and and how people treat you first
[1:06:09] divine love which is a constant love
[1:06:11] that doesn't change if things are good
[1:06:14] of things are bad things are up things
[1:06:16] are down is it love hallelujah and and
[1:06:19] that's a genuine love it will produce a
[1:06:22] genuine faith I trust you have that now
[1:06:26] hallelujah it doesn't matter what
[1:06:28] happens in life Paul said I'm going to
[1:06:30] be offered up you know I don't think he
[1:06:32] may be you know humanly when he was in
[1:06:36] the prison near the the mammoth time
[1:06:38] prison whatever it's called there you
[1:06:40] know he was he was in this place and he
[1:06:42] was beating a near shipwrecked and all
[1:06:43] different kinds of things happened but
[1:06:45] God allowed that to happen to him
[1:06:47] because God was proving to him your
[1:06:48] faith is genuine amen he didn't have an
[1:06:52] easy road he had enemies without em with
[1:06:54] us when he said he fought the beast in
[1:06:56] Ephesus it wasn't it wasn't Lions in an
[1:06:59] arena it was people it was religious
[1:07:01] spirits on people and I believe just
[1:07:04] like brother bear Amir brother bear has
[1:07:06] I think Billy Paul said about his father
[1:07:08] he spoke of his enemies and his friends
[1:07:10] to say she couldn't tell who was what
[1:07:12] and that was now that was the son of man
[1:07:16] revealing an a son of men a mature
[1:07:19] believer this is how he this is how he
[1:07:21] spoke of others
[1:07:23] now what about us what about us because
[1:07:28] here was a mature son here was gold that
[1:07:30] was refined in the fire and he was in a
[1:07:34] real fire Alleluia to show us remember
[1:07:37] we're norm in the pelvis resurrection
[1:07:39] and we love that part of the verse don't
[1:07:41] we see God come down transformed people
[1:07:45] turn us from death to life hallelujah
[1:07:46] God move it open his word and all these
[1:07:50] things but in likeness of the sufferings
[1:07:52] we would know him in the likeness of his
[1:07:54] sufferings Alleluia we have some
[1:07:57] musicians to come find us in the
[1:08:01] sufferings praise God for suffering I
[1:08:04] know that sound you say brother Ben
[1:08:07] that's crazy
[1:08:08] praise God for suffering because if he
[1:08:11] is if he is our Shepherd and he he's not
[1:08:14] a New Zealand Shepherd that gets a whole
[1:08:16] bunch of dogs and chases some some sheep
[1:08:18] but he calls him by name and he speaks
[1:08:21] to them and they know his voice and they
[1:08:23] come to Hermes he's gonna lead you
[1:08:25] hallelujah but the Sheep loved the
[1:08:28] shepherd the sheep loved the ship and I
[1:08:31] trust you love him so if he's leading
[1:08:32] you now if he's leading you through
[1:08:35] something you would have confidence he
[1:08:37] won't leave me here because he won't
[1:08:38] lose one of hers amen and then he said
[1:08:42] to Joe I'm John's disciples John is now
[1:08:44] in prison and brother Graham says his
[1:08:47] Eagle eyes have have clouded over and he
[1:08:49] sends disciples to Jesus asking are you
[1:08:51] him or should we look for another and
[1:08:53] then Jesus tells the disciples of John
[1:08:55] sit down we could have a meeting and
[1:08:56] I'll show you what happens there you're
[1:08:58] the lame walk and the blind see in the
[1:09:00] sick of heal that all different things
[1:09:01] happen then they take the report back to
[1:09:04] John and Jesus says blessed is he
[1:09:05] there's not offender than me so he's
[1:09:08] saying to John blessed are you if you're
[1:09:10] not offended that you're now in prison
[1:09:11] at the end of your ministry amen so the
[1:09:14] question is now do we get offended when
[1:09:16] God leads us through dark places do we
[1:09:20] get offended by oh I shouldn't have done
[1:09:21] this shouldn't have happened to me and
[1:09:23] this is wrong and what's going on God
[1:09:24] and you know but in an angry way because
[1:09:26] we know I think we can't ask him what's
[1:09:28] happening that's your approach but I'm
[1:09:30] the Bride of Christ and this shouldn't
[1:09:32] happen to me and this should all be fine
[1:09:33] and everything should just work out fine
[1:09:35] well is that what was that God stepped
[1:09:37] for you or do you get offended at it I
[1:09:42] trust Lisa to see that's not offended in
[1:09:45] him I mean you know do we get offended
[1:09:48] if we lose our jobs or if we or if we
[1:09:52] don't have enough money in the bank or
[1:09:53] if we can't buy that new car or if our
[1:09:56] family maybe begins to fall apart or
[1:09:58] someone goes sideways or do we get
[1:10:00] offender than that I trust we don't but
[1:10:05] we had this ideal picture of how things
[1:10:07] should be but is it God's plan for your
[1:10:09] life
[1:10:09] God you know God you know sometimes God
[1:10:12] will take someone like and the majority
[1:10:15] really experience can be four years but
[1:10:19] God is revealing himself in that life so
[1:10:24] so some people seem to have a great
[1:10:26] overcoming life they just crest every
[1:10:28] wave other people are submarines and
[1:10:29] they're dragging on the bottom but
[1:10:31] they're moving but God it doesn't mean
[1:10:34] God's pleased with one and displeased
[1:10:36] with the other one God has ordained the
[1:10:38] steps of you know the steps is a good
[1:10:40] manner ordered of the Lord and he
[1:10:42] delighteth in his way though he fall
[1:10:44] lower for how he shall not be cast down
[1:10:47] so that's why we should never doesn't
[1:10:50] matter what other people are doing you
[1:10:53] know to be honor okay so it's been my
[1:10:56] family because we're one but everyone
[1:10:58] now well it's it's God at us and God and
[1:11:01] your family and God in your family you
[1:11:04] have to walk sovereignly it's it's not
[1:11:07] my hand your hand in his hand in a way
[1:11:10] at the end of the day I'm not going to
[1:11:12] be standing next to you you know what I
[1:11:14] mean it's you and God individual affair
[1:11:17] between you and God and he will lead you
[1:11:19] the way he's going to lead you and he's
[1:11:21] not going to lead you in a way that is
[1:11:23] just gonna send you to ruin he's gonna
[1:11:27] let you walk down a path for a reason
[1:11:29] because he wants to express part of
[1:11:31] himself in your life and that part will
[1:11:33] be different for all of us
[1:11:37] hallelujah because he wants to sa you
[1:11:40] you see you see David's essay was
[1:11:44] different to Abraham's essay which is
[1:11:46] different to Moses essay which is
[1:11:48] different to Isaiah as I say at Jeremiah
[1:11:50] Elijah they're all tested just like
[1:11:53] Peter James and John their testing was
[1:11:55] different John the Baptist was different
[1:11:57] it's all different si
[1:11:59] but God is proving their gold their gold
[1:12:01] they go their gold their gold Alleluia
[1:12:05] and God doesn't change amen
[1:12:08] let's um I want to sing
[1:12:12] I believe the true report I believe the
[1:12:15] true report hallelujah to the lamb amen
[1:12:20] I trust your faith the trust the
[1:12:25] genuineness of your faith has been tried
[1:12:27] that's why we go through things God
[1:12:29] wants to see how you're going to react
[1:12:31] how are you going to react to the
[1:12:33] situation it's like Joe let's see how
[1:12:36] he's going to react God knew how I'd
[1:12:37] react but Jobe actually he wanted to
[1:12:39] prove to Joe hey this is how you reacted
[1:12:41] in this situation and with his mouth he
[1:12:44] didn't curse God didn't actually speak
[1:12:45] against them at all
[1:12:46] so God God actually allows it see how
[1:12:49] you gonna react
[1:12:50] how you gonna wreck that the ones you
[1:12:52] love the most turn against you I make
[1:12:56] gaku cause the whole church to turn
[1:12:57] against you how you gonna react oh they
[1:13:02] hate God would never have caused that to
[1:13:03] happen how do you know
[1:13:06] God could cause the goodness of things
[1:13:09] to happen misunderstandings then he
[1:13:11] asked the question have you looked
[1:13:13] What's in you how you gonna react you
[1:13:14] get around to going to the sky or the
[1:13:16] faith that's in you
[1:13:19] is the challenge I believe the true
[1:13:22] report I believe the trip all the laughs
