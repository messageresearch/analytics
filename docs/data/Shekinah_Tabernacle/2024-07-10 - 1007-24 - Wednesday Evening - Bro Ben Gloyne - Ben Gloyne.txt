may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high plac wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith yeah you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there onto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight if you have a need you slip your hand up before the Lord amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord that's our heart's desire Lord we want to be holy separated Lord into your hands Lord God that you can do whatever you want to do when you want to do it through our lives Lord

what Only You Can Do Lord we love you so much and we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh tonight I want to I want to take this aspect I've been I've been pondering on it about uh from verse 15 here that your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen we know uh you on Sunday we're talking about taking the sword of the spirit which is the word of God or the inspiration of God and um brother Braham tells us that we know this Armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it's not a second thing you need to get but if you've been filled with the Holy Ghost you you you have the full armor of God Amen that's the only way to stand in this evil day so now this uh your feet sh with the preparation of the gospel of peace now this word I really enjoy this word preparation here because uh yeah it's there so so it has many many of course to be be uh the act of preparing it's the condition of a person or a thing as far forth as prepared Readiness is being you know but but I like it where where the root meaning of this word it means part of it means to prepare the minds of men to give the Messiah a fit reception and secure His blessings amen so if your feet are shod with the gospel with the prep preparation of the gospel of peace I say you are prepared you are ready to make a fit reception for the Messiah amen because it's the biggest fear I think that would strike a Believer is am I ready amen isn't that right we want to be ready we want to be ready to move amen and I say that the Lord has made us ready amen that you know it's not our ability that makes us ready but it's what's been given unto us to put on that's what's matters amen as the Apostle Paul say take under you the whole armor of God Amen the the reason he would say that is because there was armor to put on Amen that it wasn't they didn't have to work out what they needed to where it was already there for them amen as as um as John as he saw in Revel ation 19 one of my favorite favorite parts of the Book of Revelations and you know as and and and and John would say and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and the voice of many Waters and is the voice of Mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready amen so she is prepared and to her was granted that she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God Amen so the so the bride has made herself ready because she's been granted to put on these garments amen that's not something that you know that that the bride works out how to do in her own strength no the word has been given and there's something in us that puts it on Amen I mean to be fashioned in this word now we know the strength that we walk in is the is the strength of the Holy Ghost himself amen it's not our human ability that allows us to walk this walk but it's but but it's God's ability amen and it's our Footwear is very important you know I remember when I um you know I was at boarding school many years ago now and you know the first the first morning of the Year we'd have to get up about 6:00 in the morning the whole boarding house had to go for a run round the field one one time I decided I'm going to run bare feet that was a bad idea it was Frosty it was cold and we had to run a long way my feet weren't prepared i w I wasn't wearing the right kind of shoes to make the journey comfortable amen I still made it I've still got all 10 toes I can still count with them you see but you know some people can go far enough for long enough in the wrong conditions with the wrong Footwear and they get Frost bright they start to lose part of themselves but but the and and and how you walk is really based on the Footwear you have if you have no grip on your shoes and you know you have no grip on your shoes and it's slippery and muddy and wet you got to be careful how you walk right you can be sliding along and doing the splits and falling over and covered and my the person right next to you is just kind of strolling along why cuz they've got the right Footwear now there's only one kind of Footwear that can make this journey there's not two there's only one what I'm saying if you got the right Footwear you can walk with confidence amen you don't have to walk in fear that you're going to fall over and trip and something's going to snag you and you're going to slide no you have confidence that the that the one who gave you these shoes is going to carry you through amen so now as as um in the first Exodus here you know Israel was told to to take the lamb we know it had to be without blemish the male of the firstborn and you know either the sheep or the goats and they had to keep it up for a certain amount of time they had to take the blood and strike it on the two post of the you know door and the you you the upper post of the house and they had to eat it that night they had to roast it with bitter herbs and have it with unleavened bread but you see but then even Moses would give or God would give the instructions this is how I want you to be dressed when you eat the lamb that you got to be dressed to leave amen you're not dressing to stay you're not you're not here to have a big long feast and staying go should know this is the last night you're going to be in this place you're going to be dressed to leave this world or leave Egypt amen it's the same thing with us friends we are as we eat the word as we eat the lamb as we draw strength amen and virtue and peace and love and joy from the word of God Amen we're dressed to leave amen we're dressed to leave amen as as as God would tell them you got to you got to eat it with your loins GED your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand amen you got to eat it in haste amen so don't just sit around and no eat this with purpose amen and so we're going to realize that it didn't matter how weak the Israelite was all they needed to do was eat the lamb maybe there's old Grandpa Grandma they couldn't even get out of bed they bedridden and maybe they would tell the family just just leave me here you can't carry me it's too far and look I just can't walk anymore I've been beding for so many years and I just can't do it you know I just can't get up and you know maybe the head of the house maybe their son would say you know you know Dad Mom just eat this lamb eat this lamb that God's provided amen have this unleaving bread and you know maybe they'd start eating it they'd find strength come into their body I mean where they once bed they couldn't walk they troubled and they look at their own Frailty and their insufficiencies but they begin to draw strength from that land I mean they begin to stand up and say look I can walk I can move my feet amen and then hallelujah then then the first thing in knew they were ready to leave when the trumpet sounded amen and God would come down and he would tell them in is um Deuteronomy 29 that for for the 40 years they are in the wilderness that their shoes didn't get old amen and their clothes didn't wear out why is that because and there wasn't a feeble one among them amen if you read Deuteronomy and so on why is that because they walked out of Egypt under the power of the Lamb I mean under the power of the blood I mean and that strengthened them sustained them for their 40-year Journey hallelujah we're not journeying 40 years upon the Earth We're Going upward amen and is a natural the strength of a natural lamb amen a sacrifice there and under the Old Testament there could get them from that place strengthen them and they could walk in that way how much more this amen we can realize that the clothing we've been clothed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it doesn't wear out amen it doesn't get holes in it amen this armor cannot be punctured amen it can't be dented it you may receive a lot of strikes amen but it can't be dented amen it can't be it can't be holes it doesn't have to be replaced it doesn't need to be patched up with a new idea but no the word of God is as given is just as good today as it was when it was given amen so it shows just goes to show that we can walk in confidence amen because these these feet that we these shoes that we're shot with this preparation of the gospel of peace has made us to have such an attitude that Messiah is very welcome that Messiah can receive a fit reception I'm just reading that bottom part in the yellow there I me no no notice now how differ how different we were before we were dressed this way with our attitude towards the Lord to how we are now before I ever met God I would never have come to a place like this I just be honest I would never be standing here I wouldn't be reading this I would never have come to a place like this but God said you are dressed wrong I'm going to get a hold of your life I'm you're going to willingly give yourself to me and I'm going to dress you I'm going to I'm going to put the right shoes on your feet amen that you are now fit to to to receive the Messiah amen that you can you can be fit that when he comes back again to catch his bride away you are prepared you are ready you're not just standing there watching events unfold and seeing what's happening in the world no you are the main event amen because the Rapture the secret going of the Bride of Jesus Christ is the main world event that's taking place right now I mean there's a people around the world out of every nationality am mean are being dressed in the word of God they're being prepared they're being transformed by the AP ISM of the Holy Ghost and they are getting ready to leave amen and if you're not ready get ready let God get you ready Amen Let Him transform your life and change you to match his word amen so now so so we because there's always a question that can come up up in a believer's mind the devil loves to plague people with it am I ready to leave and it says in Ephesians 4:30 grieve you not the Holy Ghost whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption am mean so there's a sealing that takes place that you're sealed to the the day of your Redemption that that means now that you're sealed to your destination y yep amen amen my destination's glory where are you going am mean the seal on your life will dictate to where you're going am me it's like you put a package you put a address on it you get a cuer sticker whatever and that goes to where it's being sent to that's right amen we're not being sent to some part of the earth we're being sent to glory amen amen the Holy Ghost is packing us amen it's going to carry us away amen and it's to secure his blessings hallelujah amen amen we're a blessed people tonight we're are very blessed people tonight amen you're the most blessed people in the earth amen I'm talking about the bride around the world we are a very blessed people amen amen well we don't just have some of his blessings amen we don't just have some of his blessings it's a blessing to know that he lived it's a blessing to know the tomb is empty it's a blessing to know that this word is true it's another thing to see that same God step out of history and prove as word in our lives amen that's the Supreme blessing amen that we don't believe he rose just cuz the tomb is empty we believe that he rose because he when he said he would and two he stepped out of History to you and I in this day amen he's proved himself alive in 2024 sir Amen to me that's a what an incredible thing and and we secure His blessings so don't they don't slip they're secured well how how do I secure them he makes sure you hold on to them amen hallelujah amen amen amen and I and and I'll say it this way and if any blessing gets stolen it's going to be returned come on Amen like I heard someone say a story about a young boy I think he had a sailboat you know he made the sailboat and he went sailing in the river and and you know but but but one day the current was too strong and the sailboat just went down the river the boy couldn't catch it so this boy's very sad that he lost his sailboat he's all upset cuz he spent a lot of time making the sailboat but then one day he was walking down past the cash converters and he looked in the window and he saw his sailboat you know what he did he saw the price on that sailboat he went home broke his piggy back open or transferred some funds I don't know what he did but you know he got the money that was his money right amen and he went to that place he bought the sailboat he walked out and then he said sailboat now you're twice mine you're twice mine sailboat hallelujah it's like the Lord Jesus we we were his before the foundation of the world but then we came into this Earth we're born lost he came looking for us and he grabs us a hold of us picks up and says now you're twice mine and I'm not letting you go no more hallelujah hallelujah amen so if Joy was once yours it can be twice yours if it's been taken amen if the peace of God that pass all understands been taken it can become twice yours am amen you take any any any blessing of God Amen it can become twice yours I tell you when it becomes twice yours it means twice as much to you amen cuz you know what it's like to have it you know what it's like to lose it but you know what it's like to get it back again amen and when you get it back back again it means a lot more to you when you maybe you first had it am hallelujah amen so there's a Hallelujah so it makes us fit isn't that wonderful that he makes us fit give the Messiah a fit reception amen so there's a there's a heart of love and Thanksgiving and joy that gives him a fit reception he feels welcome when he comes into your presence amen there's not a spirit of unbelief and skepticism that would push him away there's a welcoming Spirit like many times brother Ram would stand in the prayer line or you discernment line someone comes up before him and says you are a Christian you have a welcoming Spirit wouldn't that be a wonderful wonderful thing to be told of you and I that there's a spirit in us that's so welcoming that the lord loves to be around us amen that we don't have a we don't have a a a spirit that gives him the wrong kind of reception that gives him rejection that makes him not feel welcome but no the Lord has made us in such a way that we give him a fit reception yeah amen hallelujah as second Timothy uh the Apostle Paul be writing to Timothy he says I've fought a good fight I've finished my course I've kept the faith henceforth there is laid off me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing amen so you know that you've been made you're wearing the right shoes when you love is appearing amen when you love the manifestation of his Spirit when he begins to move Among Us amen you can be in your car you can be at home and you just feel that sweet presence of God come around you and it just Thrills your soul it makes your day I mean what is that you love his appearing amen and you love his appearing because there's a crown of righteousness laid up for you on that day am hallelujah amen isn't that oh to me that's tremendous amen whether there something in us that loves is appearing amen we don't get angry when he moves we don't get offended when he touches someone else's life we don't get annoyed when he blesses someone else no we're happy for that person we're happy when God fulfills his word amen we're pleased when God moves and does something in our midst amen we are thankful for that amen why is that because we love his appearing praise God praise the Lord hallelujah now now these these these feet that we're sha with or the or the shoes that we're shod with are going to take us on a journey and it's a glorious Journey amen I'm I'm sure everyone can relate to that it's a glorious Journey it's not always an easy Journey but it's a glorious Journey amen I say the the the destination is well worth the journey amen amen and now in order to in order to Walk This Way see these shoes have a have a very interesting thing about them they have a mind of their own right the shoes I wear I decide where they're going to walk unless someone else is run unless William's got them and he's running off somewhere walking in them but the shoes of the preparation of the gospel of peace have a mind of their own because it's the mind of Christ amen and if we stay surrendered because we got to stay surrendered to the mind of the Lord right that's why David would pray in Psalms 119 he says look thou upon me and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do uh unto those that love thy name Glory order my steps and thy word and let not my and let not any iniquity have dominion over me so his prayer was Lord order my steps in thy word Lord I need a certain kind of Footwear that I'm going to walk in thy word I'm not going to walk in my ideas and my opinion and what the world is hasht trending on some Instagram stream somewhere no we our our steps must be ordered in his word amen and if we but the thing is if we realize if we allow God to order our steps in his word there's tremendous blessings to have amen there's there's such a rich relationship we can have with our Lord Jesus Christ that before we start walking we could never imagine how great it is amen if you look at any of the Heroes of Faith down through the Bible amen they would have I believe if they could you know you know if they could be resurrected and placed right here and they and they gave their testimony and You' ask them about the hardest time of their walk and you'd say maybe would you want to change that they'd say no why because God proved himself in those moments am mean I do not have the testimony that I have without those moments amen and I treasure those moments because the lord always showed up in those moments you see these shoes these shoes are incredible shoes amen because they got a security detail that walk around these shoes amen the Lord himself he says you know that the angel of the Lord encamps about those that fear Him and delivers them all amen so so we're not walking alone in this journey now I don't know if I have it here but um if I can find it no I don't but you know we know the scripture well that Enoch you know it says that Enoch walked with God right we know that scripture well now in other translations it said that Enoch habitually walked with God so it became a habit of Enoch to walk with God now a a a habit can look like something that's just done subconsciously that's part of a habit right you know but the thing is a habit when it comes to Walking with God is your heart's got to be in it now I was thinking the other day now this may seem a bit of left feel but you know some people you know the devil puts it on people's minds do they feel like they have faith or do I feel like do I really feel like a Christian and I was thinking so my last name's gloin as we all know what does it feel like to be a gloin I have no idea but the reason I know I'm mlin because I was born one so I'm not one day feeling oh yes I'm a glory next day I don't feel cuz I don't know what that feeling Baseline is I just there's nothing tangible I can say yes it's this and I feel like this and it's the same thing with being a Christian feeling like you're full of Faith feeling like you're not feeling like you're a Christian that's irrelevant you're born one I mean like brother R said they I've been in the Brandon family 53 years they never asked me to join I was born in it amen so when the Devil comes on and ask you do you feel like a Believer do you feel like the word is true do you feel like you're overcoming you say I have no idea cuz I don't know what that means hall hallelujah amen so we don't walk by faith we don't we don't worship or walk with God because we feel like it cuz what does that even mean it's so to i' just been thinking about this like what does that even mean it's like if you ask me what you ask any of my children what's it like to feel what does it feel like to be glowing they'll look at you with some funny stare I'm sure cuz it's so it doesn't make any sense and the devil asks you the same thing about being an overcomer I don't know what that feels like I was born one that's the main thing amen I'm born I was born and overcome by the Holy Ghost amen I was born to be full of Faith by the Holy Ghost AM mean I was made a Christian born a Christian by the Holy Ghost so whenever the enemy makes you oh do you feel what do you not well you say well I don't know you're asking the wrong person you ask yourself that you don't know the question either so we don't walk by feelings we walk by faith so a habit can be the devil come along and say oh you're just walking with God by habit no but in truth you're walking with God by Revelation by desire am mean that the Lord remember Enoch there was 65 years of his life he didn't walk with God we don't know what he did but he was doing something but then in the 65th year of his life something happened where God said no no no you're walking wrong you got the wrong shoes on I'm going to give you the right kind of shoes and and and ultimately these shoes are going to take you into glory amen so so so he put on I say I say Enoch wore the whole armor of God Amen and so he was now dressed right to walk with God and he habitually walked with God but it wasn't just going through the motions his heart was in it my Lord amen it was the main thing of his life amen and that's why I said before any hero of Faith through the hard times where God came on the scene that's I I loved walking through that moment why because God built his relationship with me in that moment amen those things mean the mean mean the world to me because God proved himself in those Hard Times amen so walking through the fire walking through the flood walking over mountains or down through valleys through Bri patches it's all worth it cuz God wants to prove himself in those things amen that's why God God would allow us to walk through those places now let's go to let's go to Psalms 23 Jus let's read this I don't I don't have it on here so we're going old school we're going to be turning uh yes whatever this paper's called I don't know anyway Psalms 23 the thin paper how's everyone tonight wonderful has everyone got the right shoes on Amen praise the Lord hallelujah remember H Jimmy where's he gone he's out the back yeah but I remember being in um being in Chile with brother Jimmy I mean no sorry brother Pedro's brother you know walking around just in bare feet or socks in the house no no you don't you don't wear that here you need shoes on you need shoes on wherever you go you need shoes on okay in the Christian walk you need shoes on you need the Lord's shoes on hallelujah amen Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to light down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he leads me he restores my soul he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path Paths of righteousness for his name's sake ye th I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod on thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointeth my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen now now now for those who are wearing the right kind of shoes this Psalm means a lot this SSM means an incredible thing to them amen where where where where they have a revelation the Lord is my shepherd yeah now we know a walk means a progression we don't sit still sure we're sitting and maybe I'll preach on that one day resting and fighting and walking at the same time I don't know we'll see how we go but you know but but but this see a walk speaks of a relationship ship a walk speaks of a different day speaks of spending time together having new experiences amen and so David knew what it was like to be a Shepherd he knew what it was like to have a a relationship with his sheep and so he had a revelation now the Lord as I am the Sheep Shepherd the Lord is my shepherd amen and he causes me to go through all kind of different situations but I will fear no evil amen amen why because thou art with me as I said before these shoes come with a security detail amen we're never alone in this walk amen sometimes we may feel lonely but we're never alone amen because the Lord said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee amen so so now this Psalm is an incredible Psalm because you think about it now where where David would be inspired to write these words and Believers from that moment down to this time have drawn strength from these words now those those who have these uh shoes on Amen walk through the rally the shadow of death and they fear no evil they are not worried about what will happen to them because their Shepherd goes before them amen amen we don't walk God never sends us into something without first stepping into it amen amen so now Daniel and shadra mishak and abedo they had the whole armor of God they had the right kind of foot we on Amen and so so Daniel Daniel would habitually walk with God just like Enoch would every day he would walk with with God and if you have the right kind of shoes on nothing is going to stop you from um allowing you're not going to allow anything to break your walk with God things will try and break your relationship things will try and come between you and God situations will come times of Life trouble whatever it is we'll try it but but as as as Paul would say in Romans chapter 8 nothing can separate us amen from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing and and so so Paul I'd say these shoes were put to the test in the Apostle Paul's life he was Shipwrecked he was beaten he was chased from City to City amen he was he was in Peril by those who are without the church those are within all kinds of things happen but but but he became he he became persuaded nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen why because he he had what what he was writing to the Ephesians about the whole armor of God he was already wearing amen so now Daniel Daniel no doubt would have taken this Psalm 23 with him into into Babylon now we know Daniel and shadra mesach and B too they were young people when they left Jerusalem they weren't old people they were young they were in their teenage years and their in their formative years that would shape their character shape the way that they would go they made up their made up their mind we're serving God Amen where are we going babyon do you know what it is I don't know but we're serving God that that's what they decided wherever wherever God would take them or allow them to go they're going to serve him the lord they're going to be Believers and I say the reason they could do that is because they had the right kind of foot we on Amen so now when Daniel up in years he was an elderly man with this happened but then Daniel you know heard the decree because he had enemies in the cabinet there or in court there with the King and and those enemies had the law written that that that no one was allowed to pray to any other God or Man Apart from the King for 30 days now Daniel had was habitually Walking with God and when he prayed to God three times a day it wasn't just going through the motions though sometimes it can feel that way his heart was Lord I want to talk to you I want to I want to I want to maintain my relationship Lord I want to report in and he opened those window shutters that were looking towards Jerusalem maybe said oh Al Shai Adonai Lord God Almighty it's Daniel again Hallelujah glory to your name you've made a covenant with me God hallelujah amen you know and so so what it was he was building his relationship with with God and when that decree came it didn't change who he was because he was not willing to let anything s his relationship with God Amen because we know prayer is a communion it's not just us speaking some words and yo that's it no no it's God we talking to God and God talks to us and as we're talking to God God's changing our heart and our mind to match his heart and mind amen and he's giving us Direction I was thinking really you know there's nothing new Under the Sun right Ai and and chat Bots and stuff AI stuff that's just a cheap copy of God because what what do people do when did this happen or explain this to me just a minute you know that's a cheap copy of people praying to God isn't it it's just a cheap copy the thing is you can't trust a chatbot you can trust God Amen so you know don't don't be pouring your heart out to a chatbot pour your heart out to God and God will answer in the season amen God will prove his word God will show you the way to go amen So Daniel refused Amen to to to uh let anything s his relationship with the Lord amen so so he continued praying and of course he got busted being a Christian I mean he got thrown to the Den of Lions now he didn't know that he didn't know that um you know what would happen when he got thrown into the den but that didn't change his mind he knew the threatenings of the king he knew the law of the king and he knew the King was a man of his word but that didn't stop him why CU he had the right kind of Footwear on am mean so when he got thrown into the you see you see these these shoes we wear Supernatural shoes they'll cause you to stand in some places amen where you don't you don't work it out you don't plan it beforehand but you find yourself standing in a position it's amazing because it causes you to stand amen and in face of anything it causes you to stand remember it's not us that that in our own ability that stand as a Christian every day no it's the ability of God in our lives causes us to be a Christian every day amen so he' stand there he knew the threats of the king he said well just throw me in King but I'll see you in the morning hallelujah amen so those shoes took away into a lion's den Hallelujah did he try and take them off before he got thrown in no cuz they were part of him yes amen so so those shoes caused him to walk into a lion's den am mean but the one who gave the shoes stepped down to the Lion's Den shut the mouth of the lion he pulled up maybe I know Leo the Lion fluffed his man made a pillow put him put his feet on Simba and had a good sleep that night maybe there's a good s log snore going on down there you know he was sleeping the king wasn't sleeping because the king didn't have these kind of a shoes so he was worried he was stressed what's going to happen now if Daniel got eaten up well his last breath here would be as then the next breath he would take would be up there cuz these shoes transcend Dimensions up Hallelujah so the next morning you know Daniel you know you the king came early in the morning play bags and bags under his eyes and you know all worried and stressed with his slippers on his dressing going on and comes down and says Daniel are you still alive and maybe maybe heard a stretch verse and a yawn oh good King live forever you know I'm still here you see nothing could stop Daniel Walking with God Shadrach mesach and abedo had the same kind of Footwear on we know the story as well but it's good to go back to these things I think I me so now Dano they would they would not allow see see it's amazing how you know they did not allow anything to become come between them and their God so when when when controversy came they walked into it because their walk with God was far more important than what everyone else was doing amen I mean they stood before the king and said oh good King live forever we will not worship this image that you have created isn't it amazing how people will make images of the word their opinions or fashion ideas or brother Ram said this the message says this the Bible means this I'm not bowing down to those kind of images he had already seen God come on the scene sadra misho had seen God the the Living God come down on the scene of Babylon for them I mean they were worshiping the true God so how on Earth could they bow to man's opinion when they already met the true and living God I mean the true and living God had turned up before the king's idea had already come amen so nothing could make them bow to man's IDE idea basically they could have said oh King because the king even said will you not bow to the image I have made so the king wasn't trying to pretend this was actually God made this statue no he said no I built this thing and if people were honest with their websites and their ideas and things I'd say no no I have made this image the image I have made will you bow down to this image this opinion I have made and the believer with the because these Footwear do not allow you to bow to anything but the word of God it doesn't it it doesn't cause you to bow to man's opinion doesn't matter how uncomfortable it may feel there's something in you say I'm going to stand this is wrong I'm not bound to your image that you've set up because your image is dead there's no reality to it it doesn't prove the word of God it doesn't Manifest this word I mean they could say no I've seen the god of the Bible step out of history I mean I've seen the god that spoke to Moses spoke to Abraham spoke to Noah I mean spoke to David now speaks to us I mean we've had prayer O King and God has come down far greater than your image far greater than all your pump and your music The Very God Of Heaven stepped down and given us visions and revealed himself so we're not going to bow to you we are going to so what will you bow to I'm going to bow to the Lord God Almighty which is his word doesn't matter who gives the opinion doesn't matter who Fashions an image I'm not interested amen yeah and they said oh good King we will not be careful how we're going to answer you our God can deliver us but but if not we're still not bowing amen so so these shoes took them into a furnace it took them through peer pressure it took them throughout see they would have felt no doubt very uncomfortable they knew what was coming they saw the image being built it wasn't built overnight they saw it be built they probably would have seen the plans of it in the king's Palace they knew the day of the ceremony of the unveiling they knew they were invited they knew the circumstances if they don't bow they still went they still went they knew the repercussions they still went so they went so these shoes took them through all those feelings of sticking out in trouble and the mind battles and what may happen all these things they walked right through those things and now they found themselves standing in a furnace amen but the one who gave the shoe stepped down into the furnace Hallelujah and you know what brother R says he says he says when shad mesach and abedo were in the furnace the Lord Jesus himself was in there telling them of what they were going to enjoy Hereafter he was standing there telling them of their future Hallelujah so these shoes will take you into a very hard situation where God steps down proves himself and as he's proving himself he's saying this is not your end we're having a marvelous time here but I'm going to take you over there amen and over there there's no furnaces streets of gold amen you'll be in you'll be in Eternal bodies hallelujah amen you'll be dancing around my Throne redeemed Hallelujah this why this is where these shoes take you amen so so they had a glorious time and you what's amazing where these shoes because our steps are ordered of the Lord they know what's going on in here so they will take you places that cause complexes to be broken yeah they cause you to go to places where things that bind you are loosed Hallelujah why because they were actually thrown into the furnace back and they walked out free am me so they walked they were thrown in they couldn't move they couldn't do anything they were thrown in there but then they walked out and they didn't even smell like the furnace Hallelujah that's how great these shoes are I should be a shoe salesman no these kind of shoes yes but these are the best kind of shoes hallelujah amen these are the best ones and I pray you're wearing them tonight amen now you've got to realize that we we walk we possess I'm just going to maybe wipe up Round Up finish up with this kind of thought now these shoes in the natural took them out of Egypt and took them into the promised land now we're going from this world into glory amen right and we're going to make some footsteps amen amen today you made some footsteps spiritually amen every day we should be climbing higher so it doesn't feel like I'm really climbing high but then if you look back long enough you'll see I've actually ascended what you were a year ago I'm trust you're not the same person tonight amen now Joshua was told by God wherever you put the soul of your foot is yours amen so wherever he stood it was his amen so it didn't matter what the promise was it didn't matter how big the enemy was stopping him getting that promise God said you're going to stand there you're going to possess it amen so so so Jericho looked like a big city but there came a moment after God gave him the instructions he stood in Jericho he didn't he didn't just walk around at see a um Rahab in her house no he stepped into Jericho and Jericho became their I mean AI um AI was a disappointment at first but there came a point where he stepped into AI it became his amen when they crossed Jordan it became his amen every every place they stood became theirs and that's why Joshua when he got those five Kings out of the cave he told us princes stand on the neck of your enemies am mean cuz he's telling them listen that's your possession amen these five senses are your possession amen the gates into the spirit are your possession I mean you can stand on the neck of your imagination of your conscience your reason your affection your memory all these things you can have dominion over things over those things amen that's why the Lord says that we have we have the ability to bring every thought subject to Christ amen hallelujah amen but when he was walking amen he didn't just conquer cities and take out enemies no he got blessings amen Rahab got Deliverance because he walked Hallelujah person who was bound up in Jericho couldn't get out amen because because Joshua walked amen according to as God instructed him they came out alive amen and the you the burial place that Jo um you that Joseph was buried that became the possession of Joshua Hallelujah huj and he was he was buried where Abraham Sarah Isaac Jacob all the Patriarchs was buried was where Joseph was buried in the promised land amen so a place of Resurrection became his possession praise God Amen we possess a place of Resurrection amen there's the there's no Resurrection in Egypt in the world Amen there's no place of there's no Rapture in that place amen but in Christ Jesus our lord amen there is resurrection there is Rapture amen so bury me in Christ don't bury me in the world don't bury me in some church system somewhere some religion of man some idea bury me in Jesus Christ the word amen because those who are buried in Christ he'll bring with them Hallelujah so it doesn't matter if I'm alive and remain my body's changed I go by the way of the Grave first amen if I go by the way of the Grave before the Rapture I'll come find youall I'll come find you no I don't think I'm dying but I just want to tell you if I go first I'm going to come find you Hallelujah praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen how can you do it when you're still thirsting wanting to be like the world how can you do it when you're still eating longing for garlic the flesh pots of Egypt no keep in step with Joshua that's right get the new grapes and new Pentecostal wine get drunk on it brother amen you won't even look to the world anymore something will happen to you there was a lot of Vineyards in the promised land they got drunk you get drunk on the Holy Ghost I mean you'll realize that that that what you're enjoying has no hangover has no Hang-Ups has no has nothing negative of the world there's no sin involved amen we can be we can be the biggest group of Alcoholics known to man brother Braham says a man can be drunk on the Holy Ghost every day of his life till he leaves this world Amen Here I Am Lord amen hallelujah Hallelujah Lord can you really get Joy from drinking in the Holy Ghost absolutely absolutely I guarantee some of you came in here troubled we start singing the first song by the third song you're going like this you're feeling free well what's happening you're drinking from the sorcer you're drinking from the goodness of the word the word Goes Forth you start enjoying it am me the troubles you came in with where' they go I don't know you're getting a bit tipsy getting a bit drunk hallelujah hallelujah amen something will happen to yeah let us go forward following the steps of our great leader the and Conquer remember God told Joshua every place is SS you footsteps that's possession brother them footsteps mean possession let's just keep walking into the promised land Not Looking Back to see what happened back there not what someone else is doing keep your eyes on Jesus the Joshua the leader keep but just keep moving on deeper depths and higher Heights until you possess everything that God has promised you in his word amen now I'm just going to keep now all men can not receive this this is hid from the eyes of the world and foolishness to them but those who are born and elected to eternal life believe it we see we see they are we're living let's go forward remembering this that we have something behind us Jesus said when he sent his disciples all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me good that's behind us what every promise that he made because all power is given to him the father's given all power unto the son and everything that's in heaven everything that's in heaven belongs to me and Jesus says I'm with you something to back us up yes now when he says something that's behind us it doesn't mean we've moved on from there no that's backing us up that's what it means hey if someone Big's got your back they're behind you I got your back amen amen and my daddy's bigger than all the daddies he conquered all the daddies all the fake daddies all the what he conquered hell death in the grave my daddy's the biggest one amen gave him a real black eye and deal with him and and Carries trophies around with him the keys of Hell death and the grave am me he's backing us up so of God before us who can be against us amen remembering this when we go there's something there's something behind us something in Us and something before us amen that uh that is to come believe and go something behind us something in us something going before us he was he is and shall come the same Jesus that was in um that was sorry that was is the same Jesus tonight the same Jesus that shall come the same yesterday today and forever come believe and go and tell someone else about it amen oh I love that glory to God Amen so what we can see what he was behind us what you read and hear right what you hear in the message you hear testimonies down Through the Ages that was what he was and what he was he still is and what he is he shall be amen so we can draw strength from testimonies in the word of God and say God you're the same yesterday today and forever so what you were you still are and shall be you know brother ramam says the Keystone of the whole Bible the thing that holds it together is the fact that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen let say okay I'm just going to finish with this quote and then and then the musicians can come I don't want to keep you too late brother speaks about a apple tree he says did you know every bushel of apples every Apple every Blossom every leaf that would be ever on that tree is on it right then did you know that you know you might uh gather 200 bushel of Apple off of that tree and every one of them is in that little tree when it's that big if it isn't where did it come from tell me who puts it on there it's it's in the tree when it begins and that's just the way what you have what you have to do with the tree you take the tree and you plant it in the ground and then you have to water it and as you water it it doesn't do nothing but drink drink drink it has to drink more than its portion and the more it drinks the bigger it swells out it just pushes out limbs then it pushes out leaves and it pushes out blossoms then it pushes out apples is that right and that's the way a Christian is we're planted together in Christ Jesus who is the in exhaustible Fountain of Life we are planted in Christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out everything we have need of for the Earthly Journey Divine Healing the power of God and all of these things is in every individual here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost for your planted in Christ am mean what you drink drink drink you push out to Joy I mean you drink drink drink you push out to peace peace grows Joy grows overcoming power grows why because you're drinking and pushing out it's a life that's within you it's pushing out it's not you trying to produce a fake peace no it's God produces his own peace amen everything in US everything for this Earthly journey is in us this is how great these shoes are these are good shoes I like these shoes I hope I don't sound sacrilegious saying things like that amen the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of for uh for this life's journey even the Rapture is in you right then why because remember this remember the these shoes which the preparation pie of the Gospel prepares us to give the Messiah a fit reception amen so that's why I can say that the Rapture brother say the Rapture is in you right then don't resent that that's the truth the Rapture is in us now I'll prove it by the gospel those who he called he justified and those who he justified Heath glorified Hallelujah then in heaven today we are glorified in the presence of God right now I'm just pushing out to it amen glory god is in his word do you believe it all right huah so just drink and push out that's it right you want to go walking with God drink and then push out to that walk you want a closer walk with God drink it in and push out that's why this world is so full of nonsense that fills our minds cuz the devil doesn't want us to drink and push out because he knows if we drink we're going to push out Victory amen we're going to drink and push out his demise amen we're going to drink amen and push out we're going to tread on his head amen have victory in every part of our life amen we drink we're going to push out overcoming power that that overcomes this flesh amen so this is why friends you say well I want to habitually walk with God how to do that drink in his word and push out enjoy the goodness of God you say the devil says well you don't feel like reading your Bible what does it even mean cuz you're not a Christian I'm just going to go back to that cuz I like that though you know you don't feel like an overcomer today the devil tell tells you what does that even feel like just I say what does it feel like to be a Glo I'll never tell you what that means cuz I don't know what does it feel like to be a Christian I don't know but I'm one cuz I believe it amen we believe it by faith do we not amen these are Faith shoes so let God let these remember when brother Braham left the scene he left us with shoes that work right he would he would he would explain it uh in a slightly different way and it is the rising of the sun he would speak about a car two cars just came off the assembly line perfect everything's perfect about them one has spark plugs the other does not have spark plugs so both can talk about what they are but only one can prove what it is I mean both can say the specs of the engine and how fast it go from Z to 100 all those things only one can prove it amen only one can prove that's gasoline in the tank yeah amen and so and so that car if you got in that car it would take you where you needed to go a car that works like my car works it's going to take me home I know it's going to take me home cuz it got me here I have confidence I believe my car works right and when brother Bram left he left a car a gospel that works amen he left shoes that he walked in himself and said these shoes work amen that everywhere he went he had Victory he had victory over himself he had victory over the devil amen he had victory over religious Spirits he had victory over skeptic ISM science whatever it is he had victory over everything why because he let the shoes that he was that got put on his feet walk him into Victory amen and when he left he said put on these shoes yes amen so we've had one that's proven these shoes work hallelujah amen he so let's not let's not mess with the shoes let's just wear them and what it will walk you to Healing it will walk you to peace they'll walk you to Joy they'll you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll walk you to anything you have need of they'll walk you to understanding they'll walk you to counsel to to to anything you have need of in this life's journey amen they'll walk you there if you let them walk you there amen hallelujah let's have the musicians tonight but I'm just thankful for that that that that one bit down the bottom to prepare the minds of of men to give the Messiah a fit reception even just that but to me means the world we don't have to fear he's made us ready he's made you ready if you believe it amen you take God at his word he made you ready remember salvation is not the cross and your own Good Conduct that was a Methodist era we've moved on we're now in the bright age whereas the blood in reality it's not the blood and your good contact it's the blood only salvation is God alone remember you're saved by grace and your Walkers by Grace what is that a Divine influence upon your heart and the reflection in the life that's what the grace means in the Bible dictionary amen so praise God to be that that our feet are sha with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen let's stand shall we tonight amen and let's um let's sing that song of you know I I know we sung it first but um yeah we're looking for a city who's looking for
