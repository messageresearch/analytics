There's a young man in the back called Raymond. He's just sorry to put you on the spot, bro, but just stand up for a second. This is Raymond. So, so I tell you a little story. We Raymond is about similar age to me, hence the young man thing. [Music] [Laughter] I grew up in a small um tiny little country school about an hour south of Oakland towards the like out just out in the country out in the coast. And um we would have these like a Huntley district. So the quite a big district would get together and have big sports days and um one of them was like a big cross country race that we would do and all the schools around the district will come to this one particular year it was at our country school. So there were hundreds of kids all from the surrounding districts and we would have this big cross country race. Um and funny thing was Raymond was there at the cross country race. Now that particular race that day was won by um so that day I was the victor. Okay. But I was talking to Raymond out here and he said I'm victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this weekend in Christ, Raymond is victorious. [Applause] [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; And we are victorious. &gt;&gt; So, let's stand tonight and just worship the Lord.

[Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, God bless you believers. Um Kim doesn't really have a voice, but if she did, I know she would say it's such an honor and a privilege um to be here and it feels like a family reunion. But really, I just want to say thank you to Shakina Glory Tabernacle for hosting these meetings. It is just been such a refresher for me. Um these services have just been a blessing. Um, and when brother John preached this morning, um, yesterday morning about um, the sheep calling and the lambs bleing, it made me think of a time when I was outside and I saw the lambs in our neighbor's yard and one of the lambs lost his mom and he was crying. And I remember just thinking, "Oh, that was such a helpless cry." And that was me. I came here as a lamb with helplessly crying out. And um God is so gracious and so faithful that he he always answers. And um this song is just about when I'm losing my way, I hear the shepherd's call and I trust it's a blessing. [Music] I wanded far from the fold where I was safe. And it wasn't long till I found I'd lost my way. [Music] And I cried with fear as the night began to fall. [Music] One more lost lamb. [Music] Then I heard the shepherds call. [Music] He saw my steps as they walked right into the dark. [Music] And though I went astray, I never once left his heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] That night long ago, how I still recall [Music] when I lost my way. I heard the shephers call. And he left the fold to search out that one last. Thank you, Jesus. He left 99 for there was one to be saved. And there on that ledge, one step would have ended it all. [Music] But I felt the hesus and I heard the shepher [Laughter] [Music] because he saw my steps as they walked right into the dark. And though I went astray, I never once left his heart. And that night long ago, how I still recall [Music] when I lost my way. I heard the sheepers call. [Music] And that night long ago, [Music] how I still recall [Music] when I lost my way. I heard the shephers call. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Praise the Lord. What a very fitting song that was. Amen. Let's just stand tonight. [Music] [Music] The Lord bless you and keep you, make his face shine upon you, and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face towards you and give you peace. The Lord bless you. The Lord bless you and keep you. Make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face towards you and give you peace. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

The Lord turn his face towards you and give you. Praise the name of the Lord. Why don't we just bow our hearts in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we exalt the name that is above every name. He's above every sickness, every disease, every heartache, every struggle, anything that the devil could throw at us that would try to weaken our hands and weaken our hearts, weaken our vision, but we exalt the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you are our king. The world may not recognize you, but we have set you upon the throne of our hearts. And we set you above every complex and every struggle. We set you above this age of gross darkness, of wickedness and perverseness, godlessness. But Lord Jesus, you are our king. You're the amen of our lives. You're our absolute. You're our strength. and you're our courage. You're our vision. And oh God, we ask that you would reign supreme and have preeminence in this service as the atmosphere has been created. The songs have been sung. Songs of victory. Songs from the lips of the redeemed. Hearts of gratitude. Worshippers that realize that they're not what they used to be, but they have been changed and they've been set free. And it's all because of your divine favor upon our lives. Oh God, we worship you, oh God. We exalt you, oh God. And oh father, I pray that you would bless your children. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you died for this purpose to sanctify us and consecrate us with a holy calling that you can move and work among your people and to manifest yourself as the living God. Now, oh God, we give this service over to you, Father. Lord, you move among your children the way that you want to move, Lord. We invite you, Father. We welcome you, oh God. We welcome you as our champion. Oh Lord Jesus. Thank you for these musicians. Thank you, Father, for the song leader. Lord, as they have just tirelessly in the mornings and the evenings just created an atmosphere, we pray that you bless them, oh God. Bless all the singers, fathers, Lord, the congregation, Lord, all of the families that have come from far and wide and they've come to just put their licks of fire together, Lord, to make this meeting a success. And oh God, I pray a real special blessing upon them and all of their churches and the pastors and the ministry, Father, that is preaching the message of this hour, Lord. Oh God, we're confident that it's what is needed in this hour to change our bodies, Lord, to change our attitudes, change our vision. And I pray, oh God, a special blessing upon our our pastor, our host pastor here and his wife and his family and their church. Father, I pray God that you would strengthen their hands, Father. Lord, as you've given them this vision, I pray God that you would continue to to strengthen them and bless them, oh God, and just pour out your blessings upon them. And now father as we come to this last this last evening service and Lord so many things have already been said and Lord we've seen you already do great things among us and now father we would ask Lord that just once more you would move among us and I pray God that you would discern our hearts and just change lives and move as only you can move Father For Lord Jesus, I am but a man and I I'm not a prophet and I'm not the son of a prophet, but Lord Jesus, you're the prophet of the hour. Your word is here to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. And oh God, we ask Lord that you would go and you would just divide between soul and spirit and that you would touch hearts and men lives and restore and just move. Let your desires be made manifest in your children, Father, and we'll give you the glory and the praise for it, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God richly bless you. You can have your seats for just a few moments. We just want to say what a an honor and privilege it has been minister to you. You've just been in such a lovely audience and uh been so attentive and respectful to the word and uh we see the uh we see the fire that is burning in your hearts and uh the zeal and and the passion that you have for our our husband which is our lover Christ Jesus. And uh it has just been a real uh a real privilege to be here and and uh to witness the harmony uh that that only God can can produce and in the hearts and lives of his children. And uh it's just been a real uh honor to get to know Brother Ben and Sister Christine and uh just see the spirit of Christ uh in their lives and and uh see their heart and uh you know uh it's very evident the the heart that brother Ben has and and that is to uh just to promote the message and to see a unity in the body of Christ. And I salute our brother for that. And uh uh you know it shows that his heart is in the right place. And uh you know our brother uh it's very evident that he's not trying to build a kingdom for himself but he's trying to just promote the kingdom of God. And I admire men like that. And I I say God richly bless you, Brother Ben, and and your family and your church and just all of the pastors that have come and to support the meeting and all of the ministry and and uh you know uh dismissing your services and bringing your flocks here. It shows uh your heart as well and your vision for uh for harmony and unity and and um and uh you you know you you have confidence uh to to bring your churches here. And I I just say God richly bless you. And I pray that uh you you leave here more strengthened and better Christians and and uh in greater harmony than ever before and and uh just have greatly uh just appreciated uh brother John's ministry and and uh the opportunity just to minister with brother John. We've known each other for a number of years, but this is our first uh time getting to minister together and and uh just to see his love for the people of God and and uh wanting to just uh give you something that will help you and encourage and strengthen you and and I I know you've been greatly blessed by the ministry of our of our brother and and uh you know, as as he says, he's got he's got money in the bank and and uh you know I think someone was joking around and saying his his balance is getting to zero and uh but uh you know I there was a little joke there but uh I I see his love for for you and the people and and uh I tell you we won I I think that's the spirit of Christ in this hour as we hold the baton in our hands that uh I just think the body of Christ is is uh has has drawn a line in the sand, if you will, and saying we we're we're tired of the clicks. We're tired of the fighting, and we're tired of the kingdom building. We're tired of uh one man trying to take a piece and say, "Well, I've got the kingdom of God, and you know, and I've got the ministry, and I I I I think we're just a little tired of it, to be honest with you." And uh I think we need to get back to promoting what the message is all about and that is Jesus Christ. And it's a living gospel. It's a living word. It's the it's the power of Jesus Christ moving and working among his people. And uh it's not my people. It's God's people. and and uh and you know we're just uh we're just uh shepherds and and uh we're just ambassadors of Christ trying to preach the message of the hour to strengthen the people. We want to get out of here and uh I think we're crying for one uh you know as the the more we go we just we've we've got one voice and that is even so come Lord Jesus. I don't know about you, but I don't want to be here another year. Uh it it wouldn't offend me at all if uh the Lord would just take us in the next five minutes, and I I didn't even have to preach. I you know, that just means that we've already we've done what we're supposed to do. And and uh we're just ready. And uh but you know, uh if we knew that the Lord was coming in the morning, we'd still plant our potatoes tonight. and uh we we want to try to get souls to Christ and we we know that there's uh bleeding sheep and and lambs and that are needing a real touch of God and and uh and we're all a part of that, aren't we? Uh it doesn't matter your age. It doesn't matter if you're uh well, the prophet of God said it like this. We're all ministers and uh so we're all trying to reach the lost and you know uh it's been the greatest privilege of my life to be able to preach this message and uh you know uh it doesn't mean that it's been easy. There's been a lot of trials and a lot of struggles and the devil's tried to derail us along along the way and and uh you know I've I've reached uh I guess I don't know if I'd say it like like this but I'm 43 and I I guess I've kind of uh hit a milestone in my life that I'm not I don't think I'm old and but I'm not &gt;&gt; young and uh but you know I I think I've hit a milestone stone in my life that I can say that I can look back through through life and say, you know, the devil just doesn't have enough. &gt;&gt; He He's tried to defeat me. He's tried to discourage me, tried to get me to quit. And, you know, there was those times that I thought I would, and there was times that I I I grew a little discouraged, and I I thought that I wouldn't have enough to do it. But but you know, we we've come through uh enough hardships now that we can just simply say, you know, devil, you just don't have enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you know, the devil's just whooped. He's defeated. And uh it's just uh the greatest privilege that that I've got in life, and that is to just proclaim this good news to the children of God that the devil doesn't have enough over your life either. He can't defeat you. Amen. He He doesn't have enough to defeat you. The purpose of God is already settled in heaven and it's now being made manifest in earth and and that's this earth. And and uh so you know this message changed my life as a as a young person. Uh I was raised up in Pentecost and but then the message found me when I was just about uh 12 13 years old and and it got a hold of my life. And you know as a young person it changed my life and uh set me free from so many things. And you know, I I I see the effects of this message and just just preaching it, just saying what a prophet said and knowing that it's the words of of life that can liberate God's people. And it did it for me and I'm I'm seeing I'm seeing it do it for God's people as well. You know, we're in a season where uh I I'm seeing prodals come home. Uh I I've I've been able to witness it uh just over and over. uh young people that were hurt by church splits and things of that nature and went into the world and and just just God in his sovereign grace coming down and and uh see the makeup and the worldliness and fight trying to hold back the tears and then they lose the battle and the tears begin to flow and they come back and give their heart to God and I you know I I'm seeing it over and over again the prodals coming back to God. And again, it just shows the devil doesn't have enough. I I know he tries to he tries to, you know, puff himself up as if he's something and he's got, you know, he's got the final say over our lives, but you know, in the leodys church age, the Bible shows us that that the the amen of God, the faithful witness of the word comes among the church. and he's the amen. The devil's not the amen over your life. It's God that is the final amen. And uh so, you know, there's a lot of things that we can look at and grow discouraged and fearful and all of those things, but you know, the prophet of God told us to look and he never he never pointed us to the the the problems that is in the world. He never pointed us to the church problems. He never even pointed us to uh Leoa necessarily. He just pointed us to Jesus Christ. And he said he just said that if you'll look, you'll live. And if you can't find him, look again. And I I think that's where we're at. We're in the season of looking again. This message has been vindicated. It's powerful. It has the power to change lives. It's the answer. And I think we just need to look again. I I think as our brother said it this morning, Amen. Let's just put the past behind us and let's get a fresh vision of this message because we are it's a special season that we're living in. And uh I believe it. And so, you know, uh this is my last service, so I just want to take a few mo of these moments, you know, and we're we've we've uh we've we've got to see make new friends. And I say God richly bless you. Uh we've we've got to renew old acquaintances. It's hard to believe that uh we come to New Zealand the first time. I think it was about 10 years ago and I feel like I was a kid. And some of you are looking and saying, "You're still a kid." And uh uh we we pray we've grown a little bit and uh but there's one thing we we have grown in and that is confidence in this message. And uh so we just pray for you, you continue to pray for us. And I know that uh if we never see each other again on this in this life, we'll see each other in eternity. And that's what we're longing for is the rapture and the change of our bodies. And I just want to say to you young people, press the battle. It's your time. It's your season. Amen. Take courage. And uh and you you just look to some of these elders. Uh they didn't get here by accident. They've weathered a few storms, a whole lot of storms. And there's some oak trees that you can just uh come under their shade. And they'll tell you, son, daughter, it's because we just surrendered our life to Jesus Christ and we're witnesses of what this message can do. And so, amen. We just want to say God richly bless you. I, you know, I want to read this quote and we're going to then we're going to turn to our in our scriptures, but the prophet of God is referring to Mark 11:24 and he says, "Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe you receive it." Lord, we prayed for a meeting. We've been fasting for a meeting. We've been crying for a meeting. Yes, Lord. I believe the meeting's on the road. Then stand there like, "Oh, till the power of God comes down." When it hits it says, "Yes." Next man says, "Yes." Look, you got double power. Yes. Yes. Triple power. Yes. Four times power. Yes. First thing you know, it becomes thousands powers of yes. Then the Holy Spirit moves in and confirms the word of God with signs and wonders following. That's it. That's what we need. An expectation. And so as we minister the word of God, I just want your heart to begin to agree with the word and just simply say yes to the word of God. Amen. All you need is one person to say yes. Then if another person will say yes, you've got two powers of yes. then the three power and a four power. And if we could all get together and begin to say yes to the word of God, then omnipotence is coming to omnipotence and something has got to take place. I just want to encourage you, get your eyes off of your situation, off of your problems, off of what you're going back to when you go home, and just look to Christ this evening. Amen. And so, Zechariah the 4th chapter, we read this uh last night and we're just going to read the same scriptures again if you don't mind. And we're just going to take uh our text, faith and grace. Faith in grace. And we're just going to take a part two of this if you'd like to stand to your feet with us. Zechariah 4 and verse one. And the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me, "What seeest thou?" And I said, I have looked, and behold, a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof, and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?" Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Zerubable? thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it and then Psalms 110 and verse three reads like this thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power if I should ask who is thy people. Amen. How many can say that you are that people? Amen. &gt;&gt; Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. Now, let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, we just express our appreciation for all that you have done for us thus far. And now, Lord, we just ask that you would move by your spirit. Take us, Father, in your hands and speak through us, Lord. And fathers, just take the people in your control and in your hands, Lord. And Father, let us be willing this evening to receive what you would have for us by your grace. And now, Father, we give you all the glory and the praise in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God richly bless you. You can be seated. And so again the prophet would say do you see the message will not come by some great might or powers but by the spirit of God and this is not an ecumenical move that we are in but this is a Holy Ghost move. It's not by might it's not by power but it's by my spirit saith the Lord. And in the day of his power, the people shall be willing and be they'll be willing to be placed that the Holy Spirit can flow through the church of the living God through individuals where God can say there goes my spirit flowing freely. And uh you know the prophet of God would say the secret to the success of his mis ministry was what he surrendered himself to. He would actually say that it's not me the son of man. It's only what I am surrendering myself to. And his ministry was to introduce us to the son of man Jesus Christ the word. And so, brother Brandham would say that it's only what I surrender myself to. And the success of the bride in this last days is going to be the surrender of herself to the grace of God. That it's not by might, it's not by power, but it's by his spirit, it's by the grace of God. We would find that in 2 Corinthians the 3rd chapter the 17th verse Paul would say now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty. So he is identifying that the lord himself is that spirit and we find these scriptures so so relevant to our age. Amen. that we find there in 1 Thessalonians the 4th chapter the 16th verse that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout or with a message and what is that message to do is to gather the bride together. Amen. Because where the body word of the son of man is there the eagles will gather together. But then there is the voice of the archangel and the prophet would identify that as the voice of the resurrection and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first. So we're we're seeing that the Lord himself shall descend and the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty to the children of God. Then we can go to Revelations the 10th chapter and in the in the first verse and how that there is a mighty angel and he's got a he's got a rainbow over his head and the prophet of God identifies that this is the covenant angel and this is Christ none other it can be. It is the anointed one. It is Christ. And what is he doing? He is descending unto the earth. Amen. So, it's like Elohim descended the word made flesh and he and he's got dust on his clothes and he comes down to Abraham and Sarah and he and he begins to let them know, I remember my covenant. I remember my promise that I have made to you. And it's a grace covenant. It was not what you can do, Abraham. But I I'm actually going to bring you to a condition that you can't fulfill it. There there was a season, amen, that it looked like they could fulfill it in their flesh. But God allowed them to go to go years and years until after 24 years, Sarah's womb is dried up. Abraham's uh uh life is dried up. They're old people and yet they still have a promise. And it's in that season that God descends and reminds them that I am come and I remember my promise. You see, it was a season of grace that you can't fulfill it, but my favor is upon your life. And I am here to take away your complexes. I am here to take away the the the the the humanity that you're seeing in the mirror. I I'm coming to change your view from what you see to what I see. And what I see is a divine promise. Now, that's exactly what has been prophesied over this bride is Malachi 4. I'm going to turn your faith back. You are identified in Malachi 4. the faith that has been restored back. I say our faith has been restored back. Amen. We're identified. Amen. In all of these scriptures and the promises, the works that I do shall you do also. For I go unto my father, but I've got a portion of ministry in the last days that only the bride can fulfill. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's going to take the Lord himself stepping in on the scene and saying, "I remember my promise." Now, Abraham, I swore by myself. I didn't swear by you. I didn't swear by a creed. I didn't swear by church. Amen. A man is full of mistakes and failures. But I have swore by myself, by my power, that I will keep my word. Amen. Now you see there was a a a cloud and a constellation of angels and and how many remembers that the prophet of God actually says that's my Lord up there. Amen. Do you remember? Amen. If you can just put that that first picture of the cloud up on the screen. Amen. Remember they they they had the picture of the of the of the first one there that says a high cloud ring of mystery. and and everyone's looking at that and and they're turning it this way and they're turning it this way and and the prophet of God is saying it's seven angels up there and he's saying that there's one with the swept back wings and and they're all looking at it. But then the prophet of God in 65 in it's the rising of the sun. remember that he begins to take you to Revelations 1 and how that there was the son of man and that he had uh he had white hair and he says it's like the it's like the old judges how that they put a wig on which is symbolic of supreme authority. Amen. That they've got the final say. And and and and he begins to take you through all of that and then he says, "Now we've been looking at it. We've been wondering how to look at it. But you see, it was God that spoke to his prophet and said, "You've got to look at it the right way." &gt;&gt; You see, for for a couple of years, they've had the picture, but they didn't know how to look at it. So, God came down and told his prophet, "You've got to turn it to the right way." And when he turned it to the right way, he said, "That is my Lord up there." So what was promised is that the Lord himself shall descend. And he is descending through a message that is going to catch the attention of a bride. And it's the bread of life that is going to manifest a word bride in the last days. And it's going to be the grace of God to her. Now you say, "Well, now now I don't know about all of that." Well, let's just take what a prophet says. If you'll turn the picture like this and look now, there he is. And he says, "See, it's Christ." See his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth. Can you see his eyes, his nose, his mouth? just turn the picture from this the way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be. Oh my. It takes a prophet just to fix things and put it in its right order. Just take it put it the way it's supposed to be. Can you see it? He is supreme judge. There is none other but him. And that is a perfect identification again of vindication that this message is the truth. This is the truth. It is true. And making him not a third person but the only person. Now watch how the prophet he's going to take it now a little step further. He's already identified that this is the judge with supreme authority. But now he says with the white you see the dark his face his beard and his eyes and notice he is looking from him comes this light shining on the right side right hand side to which he's looking to and on the cross that's where he looked to the right where he pardoned the sinner in the light of his resurrection we still go forth in his name so He's letting you know that the message is the light of his resurrection. And this message is a pardon to the church of the living God. Those that are bound in sin and trespasses, this message has come as grace to pardon you of all your sins. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God would say that he looked to the right. And you can see he's looking to the right just like he did on the cross. Now, the prophet of God would actually tell us that grace is sovereign and it's got to come from a sovereign one. And he's identifying that that sovereign one is a king. So, it takes a king or someone with supreme authority to give grace. Now, you take the thief on the cross. You've got two of them. one on the left, one on the right, but the one on the right is the one that's saying the right thing. And what he's saying is, remember me when you come into your kingdom. &gt;&gt; Now, there was something within him, though he was vile, though he was dying on a cross, though he was sentenced to death, and there was no way he's getting out of this mess. There's no way that he can change his condition. &gt;&gt; But he's in a season of grace. &gt;&gt; There's no preacher there saying this is what you need to do and you need to do this and there's no prophet there. It's Christ the word. And they've rejected Christ the word and they put him to an open shame. And there is an elect there that is saying, "I know who you are. Now the prophet of God would actually let us know that this thief that God had never come across his mind in his life. &gt;&gt; Now what I'm trying to do is let you know the season of grace you're in. &gt;&gt; And this thief between the groves there came a sound. Lord &gt;&gt; be merciful to me. &gt;&gt; And there come another one back through blood, tears, agony. Grace took a hold and said today thou shalt be with me in paradise. Grace did that. How could that thief thief help your help himself? I just want to ask how can how can we help ourselves? &gt;&gt; But you see the prophet of God is showing us that's our pardon. And that's our Lord up there. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; And you know what that liberty is going to do? It's going to change you. It's going to change you. Transform you from glory to glory to glory to glory. I'm not what I want. I I'm not what I want to be, but thank God I'm not what I used to be. There's something that has got a hold of my life. There's an inspiration. It's changing me into his very image. It's grace that's doing it. You see? Amen. In the visitation of the son of man, will will I find faith when the son of man comes? We preached on that on Friday. Will I find faith to go to that judge in the season of grace and ask what you will? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Will I find faith? Will I find a recognition that that is my judge and my judge has become my attorney? And the prophet of God and the token says that you know you did it. You know you're guilty but yet you've got an attorney and the attorney knows the law and that eternity and that attorney amen knows that he can get you off. It's because the judge become Jesus Christ. And the prophet even would say he become judge, attorney, and jury. It's a stack deck. It's a stack court. &gt;&gt; Then let me ask you in this season of grace, how can you lose? &gt;&gt; I know the devil's been trying to derail us. He'd been trying it for the last 50, 60 years, but we're still here. &gt;&gt; I know he's tried to put scars in your life, but you're still here. &gt;&gt; And you're trophies of grace. And when you get up there on that day, you will stand there not as a know-it-all. You'll stand there as Mrs. Grace, and you'll begin to say, "It's amazing grace that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost. I was so lost in hybrid religion, in some man-made creed and dogma, but I'm here by grace. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You're not going to get there because you were under some great preacher. &gt;&gt; And yet, we thank God for great ministries. But I think anyone that preaches this min this message has a great ministry. &gt;&gt; But it's grace. &gt;&gt; It's a grace covenant. And Christ is God's covenant. And it's not if you will, but it's I already have. &gt;&gt; And so, Revelations 10:1 is Christ. It's God's covenant coming into full strength. It's the son of man, the Holy Ghost, not as a baptism, not in his emotion, but it's the covenant of the Holy Ghost. It's Christ himself coming in full strength. Not partial light, partial revelation, partial understanding, but it's a full revelation of who you are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "All that the father hath given me will come to me, and I will not lose one." &gt;&gt; That is the confidence this bride has in the son of man. He will not lose you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's coming into full strength. Everything he died for is coming into full effect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan is doing everything in his power to kill the effects of this message. &gt;&gt; He's tried to make the blood ineffective. He's tried to make the word a cold, powerless, ineffective gospel. But you see, we're living in the calling out time of the bride. We're living in the pulling out time. We're being magnetized to the headstone. Come out of all unbelief. Come out of fears of failure. Come out of the condemnation that tries to keep you, Amen, keep you under fear and complexes and tormenting you of your past. Come out of those skeptic spirits that is always criticizing the move of God and criticizing this and criticizing that. Hallelujah. Come out of those earthbound senses. Amen. of what you see and hear and and how you feel and your imagination and what you reason and your conscience come out of it. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God said that he went to a certain factory and there was a magnet &gt;&gt; and it would go over the workplace and everything that was that was magnetized was pulled up. &gt;&gt; He said then there were some other things that weren't pulled up and he said because it was aluminum. But then he seen some things that was should have been magnetized. He said, "What's the problem with those?" He says, "Well, they're too I was going to say they're too earthbound. &gt;&gt; They're too bolted down." &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, what the message has come to do is cut the bolts. &gt;&gt; All that the Father given me will come to me, and I'm not going to lose one. So God brings a power to break the strongholds of these earthbound senses. Grace is doing that, friends. &gt;&gt; Grace is breaking the strongholds of unbelief over your life. &gt;&gt; Come out of it. You see, the greatest draw is the power of the gospel. &gt;&gt; The word of God is in full effect. It still heals, delivers, sets the captives free, breaks generational curses. The devil says, "Well, you know, things that was in your family tree and it's just passed down from generation to generation, you're stuck with it." No, you're not. &gt;&gt; The greatest draw that this that this generation has is the power of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, young people. Amen. This Holy Ghost new wine is greater than any alcohol you'll ever get a hold of. the sensation of the revelation of the Holy Ghost just stimulating our souls. It's greater than drugs. It's greater than sex. It's greater than anything the world has to offer. And I say it's drawing. I say come unto this living Christ and he'll make you so drunk on the Holy Ghost you'll love everybody. You'll want to you'll you'll pray for your worst s your worst enemy. It's the drawing of the word that does it. It's because it's effective. &gt;&gt; This gospel is effective. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a season of grace. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying to save my voice a little bit. You forgive me. &gt;&gt; You see, it'll be out by the end. I promise. I try to be dignified. I really do. I I I try to be all dignified and it ain't in me. &gt;&gt; It just ain't in me. &gt;&gt; I see Brother John preach and I'm thinking, why can't I do like that? Some some of us just sweat and slobber and everything else. And I that's just my lot in life. the prophet of but but the prophet of God would bring us to the scripture there in &gt;&gt; there at the pool of shalom &gt;&gt; and how that there was a certain season that the angel of the Lord would would trouble the waters &gt;&gt; and there were sick people and diseased and and and all kinds of ailments and they're all by the by the thousands they're all around this water &gt;&gt; and they're waiting for this water to be troubled &gt;&gt; you see because in the Old Testament, &gt;&gt; there was a brazen serpent &gt;&gt; and that the angel would come. He came upon that brazen serpent and the prophet told him, "If you'll look, tell the people to look, they'll live." &gt;&gt; But you see, they they made that into some idol worship and then they had to destroy it. &gt;&gt; God forbid that we turn this message into something idol worship. But you see, then God's always made a propitiation for the for the sick and and and and to help his people. So he sent an angel upon the water. &gt;&gt; And they knew that the angel was on the water when it turned from the natural to the supernatural. &gt;&gt; The current, how they knew the current was going one direction, but when the angel of the Lord moved upon the water, the current reversed and went backwards. And they knew it moved from the natural to the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God would he you see you see water is a type of humanity &gt;&gt; and the angel of the Lord moving upon the waters. Now there it was a natural water and the B and the prophet of God would say that the people would test their faith with the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; fighting. Sometimes they would stab one another trying to get into that water. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God, I love how he said that, test their faith with the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And whoever could get there in there first, they were healed. But you see, now it's changed &gt;&gt; because the water is now humanity. &gt;&gt; And the Bible and the prophet of God in the sermon, looked, he says, "What are you looking to church?" Oh, these last days, he's been right among his people and we forget it. He's sit right among us and we didn't know it. The Holy Spirit is here this morning and maybe many will go away and forget it. Maybe many that sick will forget to believe and anchor their faith right where it should be. Now, truly, the pool is troubled. The waters are whirling backwards from the natural, showing the supernatural. The Holy Spirit is here taking a normal bunch of people intelligent sitting here well-dressed well educated looking the Holy Spirit fall among them and something whirls around them they holler glory to God hallelujah what's the matter the troubling of the water sinners sitting there backsliders prostitutes drunkards and everything else are saintly godly you can't put a finger on their lives anywhere since they receive it what Is it the troubling of the waters? What are you looking at? The Holy Spirit fall among us. I was sitting there a while ago with brother Outlaw pointing people to him here with diseases and things and could be done right now. Showing the different things that's happening in lives and things. What is it? It's the Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. What are we waiting for? The troubling of the water. It's already troubled. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say it's still troubled. &gt;&gt; I say the Holy Ghost is still moving upon humanity. &gt;&gt; I say the Holy Ghost has been troubling our hearts and stirring us to believe for all things all throughout this meeting. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would give us another example. and would tell us about Paul Rider and how that he was had a sickness and he looked like he was going to die and he couldn't get past it and over it and but then God put him to sleep and he and he dreamed a dream &gt;&gt; and Paul Rder was a logger and in this dream his boss told him to cut down a certain log with a certain size and so he's a logger he knows what he's doing he knows how to do it so he goes down there and he finds the log he cuts it down but then he tries to move it and he can't move it. He moves and all of his best efforts and all of his best, all of his strength, he can't move the lock. But then all of the sudden he hears a voice and he thought it was the voice, Amen, the sweetest voice. It was like the voice of his boss. But when he turns around, it was the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Paul, why are you fighting against it?" He said, "There's a stream right there. Roll it in the stream and ride on it." And Paul, amen, be to scream, "I'm riding on it. I'm riding on it." &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "Amen." He says, "Brother, sister, Jesus Christ promised these things to happen in the last days. I believe that we are living here. I believe that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I don't know how it's happened, but I'm riding on it. I believe that it's the truth because it's the gospel, God's provided way. I believe it's the message of the hour, the time that we're living in. It's God's provided way. I'm riding on it. Oh, live or die. I'm riding on it. I'm not fussing with it. I'm not trying to fuss about it. I'm just hook I'm just hooking. I'm riding on it. Let the critics rise. I shoot every riffle. I'm coming into camp one of these days riding on the word of God. I'm certain to arrive there. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, it's grace. Don't have to fuss about it. Don't have to argue about it. Just get in it. &gt;&gt; We're not trying to debate with the message. We're not debating about the message. We're not fighting this one about this one about the message. We're getting in the message. &gt;&gt; And the message is the power of Jesus Christ under redemption, under salvation, under rapture, &gt;&gt; riding on it. I can look at my family and say, "I know we're going to make it." They say, "How? How, honey? How, Dad?" I'm riding on it. &gt;&gt; God promised me my wife. God promised me my home. God promised me my children. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something that may blow some people's socks off. I don't have serpent seed. I've got sons and I've got a daughter. &gt;&gt; And they are they are predestinated seed. And you can't talk me out of it. I'm riding on it. I claim their souls. I claim their souls. I hold it. I am holding up my token with my Godgiven faith. And I know it's going to be by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; I've towed the line with every devil in hell. &gt;&gt; And I say Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; The sword is in my hand. &gt;&gt; We're fighting a battle. And we're Christian soldiers &gt;&gt; trampling every devil under our feet. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would give us another example of grace. He would say in the sermon, "Humble thyself." He would say, "How that was a minister and he told one of his congregation, he said, you know, you think that I can walk this log?" And he said, "Yeah, sure, pastor. The Lord is with you. How many of us house ministers heard that you pastors? Oh, sure, &gt;&gt; pastor. You can do anything. &gt;&gt; That's that's kind of the way everyone looks at the prophet. Oh, if the prophet was here, if the prophet was here, &gt;&gt; it's only with the prophet. &gt;&gt; The bride's revival is the prophet's revival. Well, I I'm I'm sorry. I I don't mean to be confrontational, but it it's just not true. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I the problem of it is I may be ignorant, but I'm not that ignorant. &gt;&gt; I can read the Bible. I read the message and I see that the spirit is bearing witness with my spirit is for me. &gt;&gt; This bride's revival is my revival. &gt;&gt; So much so that I heard a prophet say that I am the revival. If you want to see the bride's revival in action today, and you're looking at it, &gt;&gt; you're looking at an overcomer, you're looking at a son of God that has stepped into my dispensation, and I'm saying, "Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world." I'm riding on this victory. I'm riding on this power. It's taking me to my bridegroom. All I've got to do is just keep watering it. Keep watering this camel. Keep watering this p this power and my and my eleaser is telling me everything I need to know and I know him in the power of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, sure pastor, you can do it. Then the pastor says, "Well, I I can pack a log across my back when I go across." Sure. The Lord is with you, pastor. He says, "Well, I I can pack a log and and and and and will a wheel will be barrel across at the same time." Oh, sure, pastor. The Lord is with you. Your faith can do anything. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "I can put you in the wheelbarrow and pack the log." Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet says it's different &gt;&gt; when you're included in it yourself. &gt;&gt; Let that sink in real deep. It's different when you're the revival. You're the overcomer. You've got the sword in your hand. You're the one that's overcoming those giants in your life. You're the one that is a part of this third pull. I don't see myself in the first two pools. I don't have a sign of Messiah. I don't have the sign in my hand. But I do see myself in that third pull. I see myself a part of this word vision. I see myself going from glory to glory, from victory to victory. &gt;&gt; Now, some people want to point out all of the valleys. And let me tell you something. I'm the guy in the valley. I know all about the valley. &gt;&gt; I know about all of those demons telling me I can't make it. I know about all of the sickness and the discouragement telling me that I'm never going to make it. I know all about the ba the valleys. So, don't try to drag me back into the valley. But I just want to tell you the faith in my soul is upon a mountain pe a mountain top and that mountaintop is not in the valley but it's it's it's standing tall and it's saying I'm an overcomer devil. Greater is he greater is this conqueror. Greater is this uh lily of the valley that's just opium the anointing of the Holy Ghost bubbling in my soul. &gt;&gt; I don't need someone telling me all about the valley. I know the burdens on my shoulders. I know the sickness. I know about the discouragement. But what about the faith &gt;&gt; that'll get me out of this leashia mess? [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's different when you're included in it. &gt;&gt; You know, well, you can't shout. you know, you just you're shouting too much because your fruits will freeze up there. Why do we have to have preachers tell us of that all the time? &gt;&gt; We're the ones living it. &gt;&gt; You're the ones living in it. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, it's it's it's in the valley and it's up on the mountain. &gt;&gt; But you know what the scripture has taught me? I can shout and I can dance on the mountain. And I can dance and I can shout on the valley. The Bible didn't tell me that I stop being a priest when I'm in the valley. &gt;&gt; It's a sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; And it didn't say that you stop being victorious when you're in the valley. And dancing is a sign of victory. And I think we need to dance the more when we're in the valley. Let the devil know whose side you're on. &gt;&gt; That you're not just a mountaintop Christian. I'm &gt;&gt; so sick of people trying to say I'm just a mountaintop Christian. I am a Christian. &gt;&gt; I am a Christian in the valley. I am in the Christian when I'm trying to keep my head above the river. I am a Christian on Monday, on Tuesday. I don't need someone trying to tell me you need to tone it down. I'll just say this. The concord that is in me refuses to knock down for the devil. Ah. I I I just Sister Christine, you've been a blessing to me. I just want you to know I never even knew that she was going through a trial. &gt;&gt; The smile on her face, the bubble in her spirit. &gt;&gt; Why? Why someone had to actually tell me that she almost died &gt;&gt; and the devil's been trying to destroy her life? &gt;&gt; It's because there's something within a believer. &gt;&gt; Now, now do whatever you want to with that. That was free of charge. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you, finish this what a prophet says. It's different when you're included in it yourself. &gt;&gt; Now that it's mighty good for us to stay to say here, amen. It's mighty good for us to say, "I believe that's true." But then put it in action. &gt;&gt; You've got to put it in action. It's it's it's wonderful to hear about the opening of the word and the seals. And we are not mystery preachers. Every mystery concerning this bride has been revealed. &gt;&gt; There has been an understanding. The wise shall know their God, and they shall do great exploits. &gt;&gt; But with that, you got to put your faith into action. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God put us in the wheelbarrow. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Now, you put your faith into action. &gt;&gt; You got to get in the message. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, the bride has recognized her message &gt;&gt; and has recognized this is her hour of visitation and this is her season of deliverance. Quite frankly, it's her season of grace. &gt;&gt; She realizes that the grace of God is the inspiration over her life. &gt;&gt; To empower her. &gt;&gt; That word empower means to liberate. is to liberate her to to believe to to release that that deep calling unto the deep &gt;&gt; to realize that that everything that God put in her before the foundation of the world now it's her time to manifest &gt;&gt; you see it's a it's a conquering grace &gt;&gt; and as we heard this morning you can't have grace without love &gt;&gt; because they're the same thing the prophet of God says that that that that grace is love and love is grace and and and this this capstone is charity. &gt;&gt; It's grace. &gt;&gt; And we're in this season, the anointing of grace. &gt;&gt; Now, I know the world has turned grace into disgrace. &gt;&gt; But the bride is the one who's needing grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; The rest of everyone is going to go through the tribulation period &gt;&gt; and they're going to be washed &gt;&gt; through trump through through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; And we believe that there's going to be thousands, maybe even millions that make it. &gt;&gt; That are not even bride. &gt;&gt; But it's the bride of Christ that needs the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the bride of Christ that needs grace &gt;&gt; because it's her responsibility to manifest the promised son. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, prove that." Okay. The prophet of God would say, notice elect come from the word elected lady. One lady amongst all the other ladies was elected. &gt;&gt; And then he says, like the virgin was to bring forth the body of God on the earth. She was an elected woman. &gt;&gt; God chose Mary. And also God has chose an elected lady which is his bride. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest. And I say that's what this son of man anointing is grace that has prepared our hearts to believe for all things to manifest the promised son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, it's a place that has been prepared. I believe that I've been prepared for this time. &gt;&gt; I I I believe that the baton there there's been brothers that have been running the race over the last 60 years, but I believe it's my turn. I believe the baton is in my hand. &gt;&gt; I believe that I just believe, amen, that there's a generation that is going to finish the race. &gt;&gt; And it's when you're going to finish the race. It's the last leg of the race. That's when you're exhausted. &gt;&gt; That's when you want to quit. &gt;&gt; That's when your muscles are trying to seize up. at that that's when all of the training kicks in. &gt;&gt; The training doesn't kick in at the beginning, &gt;&gt; not even at the middle, but it's the last section of the race. I tell you friends, the preparation of this vindicated message has got us to this point. And now is the time you got to dig down deep and say, "I'm a son of God. I've been birthed under this vindicated message. It's not by my might. It's not by my power. But it's by the spirit of grace that is working in my life. &gt;&gt; As I've already told you, we're under the greatest vindication of omnipotent omnipotence the world has ever known. &gt;&gt; We've heard omnipotence speaking and we are the miraculous that has taken place. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this day there will be a will willing people in the day of his power. Amen. That is spontaneous. That's that's what that word willing means. Spontaneous. Our little sister when I held up that do that money. But someone else was spontaneous. It even surprised me. Someone else had had done this program before. And I tell you that's exactly our expectation. There should be something down in our heart while the word is being preached. There should be something that says, "Yes, that's me. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's mine. Yes, that's my promise." &gt;&gt; And as we're reaching out, healing's taking place. Joy is being restored. Salvation is being ministered. It's because there's omnipotence. &gt;&gt; Omnipotence is coming to omnipotence through the power of your agreement with the word. [Applause] Now, I'm getting to somewhere because the prophet of God says the seven thunders of Revelations 10 has unlocked the mysteries of the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; Now, I know a lot of people have made false doctrines out of that, the thunders, but let's just make it very simple. A thunder is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And the thunders are the mysteries that were contained in the seals. And now we see oursel in an open book &gt;&gt; because it's no longer thundering. It's the voice of God personally to you. &gt;&gt; No mystery, no confusion. It's just God speaking to his wife. &gt;&gt; Now, now why did John have to seal it up? Why did Daniel seal it up? &gt;&gt; Because he was waiting for this time. &gt;&gt; And God did it for the purpose. Now, now I want you to catch this now. giving faith for that rapture rapturing grace for that church. The thunders were revealed in the last days to give faith for rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it's going to take grace. &gt;&gt; But not just any kind of grace. It's going to take rapturing grace. It's going to take something so powerful &gt;&gt; that'll take your humanity &gt;&gt; and it'll be a bleach of his blood that washes you spotless white that you can stand there under the freedom of the Holy Ghost and say, "I am free. I am clean. There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. I am made perfect by one sacrifice and the blood of the word just keeps washing. When I find out there's something else that needs to be out of my life, I'm under the blood and I just say, "God, forgive me of it." And there's a grace that washes me. &gt;&gt; There's a grace that allows myself to see when I'm needing to make something right. It's grace that shows me that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's grace that is changing me. It's changing my direction. It's changing how I view my situation. It's grace that changes how I'm viewing life, how I'm viewing my trial, how I'm viewing my family, how I'm viewing my own complexes. It's grace that has worked in the supernatural in my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, the opening of the word came to give faith for that rapture in grace. &gt;&gt; And the world can't understand it. &gt;&gt; But Christ came to show you, to show the bride how to prepare for the great translation, faith. &gt;&gt; He's showing you how to prepare to be changed, &gt;&gt; to have a faith &gt;&gt; that'll change you in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye. Okay. Okay. I I'm I'm ready. I want to be a scholar. &gt;&gt; I want to be taught. &gt;&gt; I want to be prepared for this great translation faith. &gt;&gt; Well, the prophet of God would begin to teach us just only believe. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God &gt;&gt; brings us to a a message called perfect faith. And he starts out not in confusion. He just starts out simply saying just take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Let's just simplify the whole thing. You want translation faith, say what the word says. &gt;&gt; You want to be prepared to be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, just go through life saying, "Yes to the word. Yes to the promise. Yes, I'm a son of God. Yes, I'm a daughter of God. Yes, I'm an overcomer. Yes, greater is he that is in me. Yes. Yes, my family will be saved. Yes, this trial is to mold character in my life. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm healed. Yes. The joy of the Lord is my strength. Yes. I am not a part of dark denominationalism. I'm a part of the liberated bride that is stimulated with the new wine of the Holy Ghost. [Applause] You don't need a great education. You don't need to be a scholar at the message. &gt;&gt; Seminary, you just got to listen to this message and say yes to it. Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him. He just was simply saying yes, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; yes. He was the seventh from Adam. He was your type. You're not a type of Enoch. He was your type. And God put it in the scripture so you could go back to your type and say, "Well, &gt;&gt; all Enoch did was just walk with God." &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "If you're going through sickness, walk with God. You're going through trials, walk with God. Your family's falling apart, walk with God. The devil's trying to defeat you, walk with God. The devil says, "Hey, I've got you now." Walk with God. Just walk with God. Footsteps means possession. Victory upon victory, possessing your promised land inheritance, and all the sudden translation faith. &gt;&gt; Don't have to work it up. Don't have to work it down. Don't have to pray it into existence. You are what you are by the grace of God. Let me look at you young people. You you young men for a second. You're going to make it. You're the overcomers of this age. &gt;&gt; And I say this that with the utmost confidence, not because I'm looking at your hairstyles. Amen. You got longer hair than him, so he's got a he's he's got to be. And I'm jealous of your hair, by the way. Why can't I have hair like that? But anyways, getting off subject. I'm not over here looking at the sister saying, "Well, you know, her her skirt's a little bit longer than hers, so she's definitely going." And uh you know what? And uh oh, she got a beautiful smile. So I bet I bet God's looking at her and I'm looking at a promise. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at your hang-ups. I'm not looking at at how the devil is entrapping you and and going to pull you out this way or pull you out this way. I am looking at a at a covenant. &gt;&gt; It is unconditional and it's by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; And it's Christ the descendant as the covenant of God to make good every promise. I have a bride without spot, without wrinkle, without blemish. And it's his responsibility to save you, rapture you, fill you with the Holy Ghost. I can't work it up. I can't work it down. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Be careful. I'm starting to feel good. You see, he's he's he's preparing you to believe for all things. &gt;&gt; You got to He's preparing you to break through your own sound barrier. &gt;&gt; Some people get scared of noise. I'll tell you what that noise is about. It's an atomic blast. It's an aon sonic boom because some people are breaking through their own sound barrier. &gt;&gt; They've come in contact with angels. &gt;&gt; They've come in contact with grace. &gt;&gt; Half of the time people are shouting and rejoicing and you don't even know what they're shouting about. It's because last week the devil was dragging them into Leosa. But now they're free by the grace of God. If you got your old critical spirits, let that old hateful spirit. Why? Look at them. You know what? I pray to God that we all break past our own sound barrier. &gt;&gt; Break past our own dogmas. Break past our own reasoning. Break past our circles. Break get into the message. &gt;&gt; Get into Christ. Get into the passion of Jesus Christ, which is having a love for one another. If we said what a prophet said, we'd find out that maybe sometimes we don't have enough victory. &gt;&gt; Ah, man. I told you I'm feeling good. I don't have money in the bank, &gt;&gt; but it's my last service. &gt;&gt; You better be scared. It's my last service. denominational strongholds. You say, "Oh, we we've come out of those denominations." Yeah. Well, nickelanism is a spirit. &gt;&gt; And it's preachers trying to conquer the ley, &gt;&gt; telling them what they could believe, what not to believe, who could to listen to. Well, that's just with a prophet. Nickelanism. &gt;&gt; Well, that's just for our church. Nicoleism. &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God came here to break the strongholds. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. And the Lord himself has descended. &gt;&gt; And the covenant is in full effect. &gt;&gt; Which means I can believe for anything that is in my covenant promise. I don't need permission. &gt;&gt; I don't need a pope. &gt;&gt; I don't need a high priest other than Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't need someone to come and beg for their for their permission to believe for my body change, to believe for my revival. &gt;&gt; I'm in grace &gt;&gt; and I can believe for anything that I see in this word. Now you see I told you the other night we're under an eagle anointing &gt;&gt; and this then the prophet of God said don't forget this church cuz how could men do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them. &gt;&gt; This is an earth not an earthbound anointing. &gt;&gt; This is not a I'll box you in anointing. &gt;&gt; This is a I'll make the circle bigger anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is anointing that we see in Revelation the 4th chapter that the same voice in Revelations 1 is saying now come up higher John. &gt;&gt; Come out of that lukewarm condition. &gt;&gt; Come where the power of God is falling and revelation is stimulating. &gt;&gt; You see, we've we've heard a and received a message of grace and this message didn't come like a motivational talk. Have y'all ever heard of those TED talks? You know, every everyone wants a good TED talk to motivate them. And and and if you're want to be a good businessman and have business smarts, then you find someone that's successful and then you go listen to it and and and and you make your notes and and then you try to go live that carry it out. But you see, the message didn't come as a good TED talk. It's not something trying to motivate us. &gt;&gt; The message came in power and vindication. &gt;&gt; To convince you, the bride of your position. &gt;&gt; You see, the power of God recognizing your day in this message will put the people in the bride. &gt;&gt; The world forces this way and the world forces that way, but God forces upward. The spirit of God, which is the word of God, my word is spirit and life, will put the bride in her place, her adoption. &gt;&gt; That's what placing is. It's your adoption. She'll cause she'll recognize her position in the word. Then she's in Christ will put her in her place. &gt;&gt; You see, I I I'm looking at a grace woman. I know that's not proper English, but it's just the way that I'm trying to convey it in my heart. I'm looking at a grace woman. I'm looking at what the prophet of God would say. You are Mrs. Grace. &gt;&gt; You see, you have been endowed or empowered with unmmerited and unlimited. &gt;&gt; You say unlimited? Well, yeah, because the bride can't even blasphe now. You're saying you're stepping out on a limb. No, I'm in the message. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said that there is so much confidence that God has in this bride that she is going to be in the bride and in the rapture. This bride will not fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a season of grace &gt;&gt; that you can have faith in grace like we have never had before. &gt;&gt; You say you're just making that up. No, I'm not. It's the message of the hour and it's the season of maturity to be able to look at grace and see in your heart. I'm wanting to manifest all of these promises, but I keep getting it my own way. But there's a deep calling to the deep and the and the spirit of God is saying, "Look at my message. I've already prepared the way." &gt;&gt; Quit looking at the different pastors. Quit looking at the past. The prophet of God says, "You look at the past, you're going to wreck up. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's coming." The prophet of God gave us another little illustration about a about a bike race. Y'all y'all remember that? &gt;&gt; And how that if if if they win a city block riding a plank about six inches wide and and if they could do this this deal this ride this plank without falling off, they would win a brand new Swin bicycle. And all of them were good riders. Y'all like riding bikes? Does anyone like riding bikes still? Yeah. And and and and they could they could go to the store and get groceries for mama and they could hold those groceries in their arms and and they didn't even have to hold on to the hold on to the uh what do you call that thing? &gt;&gt; Handlebars. &gt;&gt; Don't even have to hold on to the handlebars. And they're just making the corners and they're just riding. Don't even have to worry about it. There was another boy. He was just kind of the kind of the nerd kind of kind of the kid that you know he wasn't the cool guy and he had to hold on to his handlebars &gt;&gt; and everyone were like well he's he's going to come into the race but we're not worried about him. And he began to watch him and one by one all of these good riders fell off. One by one fell off. But when it was his turn, he grabbed those handlebars extra tight. But you know what? He finished. &gt;&gt; He went all the way. &gt;&gt; They all came to him as a celebrity and said, "How did you do it?" &gt;&gt; He said, "We know we're better writers than you." He said, "That's right, boys. You're better writers than I am." He said, "But I'm going to tell you the secret. &gt;&gt; I had the privilege of watching you, &gt;&gt; and I noticed that you kept looking down. You were, now I'm going to tell you how the prophet said it. You were worried about this one. You were worried about that one. &gt;&gt; You were listening to what this preacher was saying. &gt;&gt; You were listening to what that critic was saying. &gt;&gt; He said, "But when I got on there, I learned from your mistakes." Well, I just want to say that there is a season of riders that we have learned from the past, &gt;&gt; but we are not fearful of the past. We are the riders that have the baton in our hand and we're going to finish the race. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the secret of it is we're not looking at what this one says and what that one says. Our ears are plugged to what the critic says. We believe this message. &gt;&gt; We know that we are anointed to finish as the mighty victorious conquers of the age. &gt;&gt; We've been endowed with unmmerited favor. It's that very favor that changed Ra Rahab's status &gt;&gt; from a harlot to a lady that was married to a famous general &gt;&gt; that she was no longer Rahab the harlot. &gt;&gt; Her status had been changed. &gt;&gt; It was this unmmerited favor that came upon Tamar that even though it looked like she played the part of a harlot and she did but it was God grace to give her seed &gt;&gt; and it was grace that put Rahab in the lineage of Christ. Tamar and the lineage of Christ and everyone else could point their fingers, but it was grace. &gt;&gt; It was grace when Sarah part of the lineage of Christ. But yet with all of her complexes, unbelief, and yet son of man came and told her, "You're not church any longer. You are Sarah, a princess with God." It was Esther who was an orphan girl but yet came with the right attitude to the chamberlain. &gt;&gt; All the other ladies wanted to wear whatever they wanted to, but not not not Esther. She had a she had a spirit that said, "I want to be dressed the way that you say the king likes it." &gt;&gt; And when she stepped into into the presence of the king, she found grace. And then she found out what it was all about. She was there for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; The king positionally placed her in a place where she could intercede for her people for such a time as this. Now, Satan has tried to hybrid this bride, &gt;&gt; but but again, the prophet of God says the power of God will raise the bride into glory out of all the denominations, &gt;&gt; all the high breeding. &gt;&gt; You see, I'm I'm going to skip way down. We could go into a lot of good stuff, but I've been having too much fun. You see this ministry, the son of man ministry is to make the word so real to bring an invisible union. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom call has come through this message &gt;&gt; to unite you to the capstone &gt;&gt; and that is the that is your husband. And it's grace grace over your life. &gt;&gt; He didn't marry you and then try to beat you into submission. &gt;&gt; He married you out of love. He married you because you were in the hundred parts of his mind before the foundation of the world. And he's been waiting for this season of grace to reveal who you are. We we have come into such a perfect union. Oh, that spiritual union of Christ and his church when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say there's been churches, churches, brides, brides, churches, brides, brides. But there has got to come one. There has to come a real bride. There must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection. The move is on. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at this mighty move of God. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for a bride to come. I'm saying you're it. &gt;&gt; Now we're fighting a real devil. &gt;&gt; Will you give me just a little bit more time? We're fighting a real devil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says in the sermon, "How can I overcome?" He says, "You've got to recognize him real." &gt;&gt; This is not mind over matter. &gt;&gt; It's not psychology. &gt;&gt; It's not, well, I'm just going to ignore my problems and it'll go away. &gt;&gt; And my mind is stronger than than what I'm going through. It's stronger than my symptoms. And one of these days, it's just going to disappear. Disappear. Nothing. You are fighting a real devil. &gt;&gt; Let let let's just face the reality of this. There's a devil after your souls. &gt;&gt; There's a devil that's trying to wreck you up and destroy you and drag you to hell. It's a real devil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "Now, the secret to overcoming is first you got to recognize that he's a real devil." &gt;&gt; You can't say, "Well, you know, uh, you know, you're diagnosed with cancer." Then you say, "Nope, I don't have cancer. No, you got cancer. &gt;&gt; And that cancer is a demon that's trying to take your life. &gt;&gt; Now, these the prophet's words. &gt;&gt; He said, "But then at the same time that you recognize that the devil is real and he's out to destroy you." &gt;&gt; Then you've got to recognize that Jesus Christ has already did battle with the devil and he has already overcome the devil. and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; So to recognize that the devil is a real devil is not to give him preeminence over your life. It's just only recognizing your adversary. &gt;&gt; Now that's why when John was weeping, he was weeping because there was no one worthy to open the seals. Revelation the 5th chapter he said but then that then there's an angel a messenger that says weep not John for the line of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and when he turned to see a a lion he saw a lamb &gt;&gt; it was the prophet of God says it was a lamb that had been in battle. &gt;&gt; It was a lamb that was bloody. It was a lamb that had been torn and he did it all for you. The lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed. &gt;&gt; So it's a real devil, but the lamb took your place and he has already conquered death, hell, and the grave. And if you can by the message of the hour, give the word preeminence, you can see that greater is this mighty conqueror in you. than your symptoms, &gt;&gt; then your struggles, &gt;&gt; then your heartaches. &gt;&gt; Y'all see that? &gt;&gt; You see, it's a real devil. &gt;&gt; You're going to go, you you came to this camp fighting battles and you're going to go back and still fight battles. &gt;&gt; But the revelation &gt;&gt; is that there's omnipotence on the earth, all powerful, &gt;&gt; and the power of God is greater than the power of the devil. And that mighty conqueror is living in you, &gt;&gt; giving you grace &gt;&gt; to defeat the devil in your flesh. [Music] &gt;&gt; So the prophet of God says, "You got to tow the line." You know what to the line is? Can you stand up for a second? I'm not trying to embarrass you, but you're there and you're you're trying to bluff me and you probably could do it. But I've got to believe &gt;&gt; that it's not by my might. It's not by my power, &gt;&gt; but it's by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I've got to tow the line. You know what that You know what that means? It means that you got your fist up. I've got to put I got to stand there right there &gt;&gt; and I got to put my fist up and I got to have a revelation that you're a bluff. &gt;&gt; Now, you're trying to get me to back up, but I know is he that is in me than he that's in you. &gt;&gt; And even though you're saying I can whip you any day of the week, &gt;&gt; I've got to tow the line and say you're a bluff &gt;&gt; and I challenge you. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, I challenge you to a duel of faith. &gt;&gt; I believe that my God &gt;&gt; is greater &gt;&gt; than any power of hell that would try to defeat you. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; that's what you got to do. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, you got to tow the line. &gt;&gt; You got to step up to the plate. &gt;&gt; And you got to say, "Satan, &gt;&gt; in myself, I'm no match for you. &gt;&gt; But recognizing that that I am the dwelling place of Almighty God." &gt;&gt; Now, let's look what the prophet of God says. We are dealing with a defeated enemy. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to get to it. Everything is defeated. Say everything. &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; Sickness is defeated. Death is defeated. Hell is defeated. Temptation is defeated. &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against you shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Because we are dealing with a defeated enemy. He conquered the gate of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification. And now we are more than conquerors. We just walked right into it as an inheritance. More than conquerors, we are dealing with a defeated enemy. Sickness defeated, death defeated, hell defeated, everything's defeated. The prophet says, "I wish I was twice my size. Maybe I'd feel twice as good." Well, I'll tell you, that's the way I feel right now. &gt;&gt; We are disputing with a conquered enemy. But not only did he conquer it for us, but after 2,000 years, he now stands among us, vindicating that what he conquered on Calvary is in full effect. &gt;&gt; He is identifying himself the mighty conqueror. He's still alive here. He's still here alive, vindicating his promise, royal seed of Abraham. He'll conquer the gates of his enemy. He stands here alive to vindicate himself to who? Those predestinated seeds that can see it. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God. Now those possessing the gate of the enemy after trial. Now the prophet of God and the mighty God unveiled before us. He says he's he says doomed devils are on the run. He's the mighty conqueror. Doomed devils are on the run. They always are when he's around. &gt;&gt; That's what I've been trying to tell you for three services now. He's here. &gt;&gt; Omnipotence is here. &gt;&gt; And if you can believe in the grace of God that has been that has been propitiated, the headstone has come down and it's grace. Grace doomed devils. &gt;&gt; Sickness is doomed. Hell is defeated. &gt;&gt; Discouragement is defeated. Oppression is defeated. Fear is defeated. Homosexual spirits is defeated. Pride is defeated. Hate is defeated. Jealousy is defeated. &gt;&gt; This bride is not like the first Eve. She has predestinated to receive grace. &gt;&gt; She's predestinated not to fall. She's predestinated to prove to the devil &gt;&gt; trial after trial and test after test. But she's anointed by grace &gt;&gt; to put her shoulders back to the line, have the sword in her mouth and say, "Greater is he that is in me." Hebrews 13:80 is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The same anointing, the same word, the same Christ, the same covenant that was with William Brham, that he would not let one word fall to the ground is the same anointing that's upon this bride. That as long as you are confessing this message with the right attitude, with the right Holy Ghost anointing, it will not fall to the ground. [Applause] Doomed devils. &gt;&gt; Doomed devils. What are you facing tonight? It's a doomed devil. &gt;&gt; You ready for some more? &gt;&gt; Now, what I'm doing is I'm giving you some ammunition. &gt;&gt; He's absolutely legally defeated in every place. legally. &gt;&gt; Well, the prophet of God is showing us that when he was tempted by the devil, Jesus did not bypass the word. &gt;&gt; But he told the he told the line with the devil with it is written. &gt;&gt; He did not come to do away with the law. He come to fulfill the law. It was God the judge becoming our attorney. And he was skilled in the law to know how to defeat the devil. &gt;&gt; And he knew that by the law he had to offer himself up on Calvary. &gt;&gt; The only way he could save you is through his blood. And because the lamb prevailed, he absolutely legally &gt;&gt; defeated the devil in every place. &gt;&gt; The devil Oh, I feel like shouting. The devil hasn't got one legal right at all. Nowhere. He's just a devil &gt;&gt; and a password. That's all. &gt;&gt; He hasn't got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ. He's whipped. He's whipped in sickness. He's whipped in disappointments. He's whipped in everything. He's whipped in death. He can't scare me. He can't scare you. That's all he is is a big old shadow. So, he just might as well get on down the street. &gt;&gt; I just seen his red light go over the hill a while ago. Didn't you? He's gone. &gt;&gt; Well, if the prophet of God said that, I say that's the word of the Lord for my life. The devil is defeated. I've seen his red lights. He cannot stay in the presence of God. But now listen, &gt;&gt; this is where your faith comes into action. &gt;&gt; You're in the wheelbarrow. &gt;&gt; You're a part of this third pull. &gt;&gt; You're a part of this faith in action. &gt;&gt; Now the devil's left. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Let the sick say, "I'm healed." &gt;&gt; I seen his red tail lights &gt;&gt; go over the hill. You're healed. &gt;&gt; Well, I've got a demon of depression. &gt;&gt; It's already left you. &gt;&gt; You say, "What gives you the right?" Do I need to read it again? &gt;&gt; He might as well get on down the road, down the street. I just seen his red light go over the hill a while ago, didn't you? He's gone. &gt;&gt; He can't stay in the presence of our mighty conqueror. And he can't stay in your presence either because you realize who you are. You're the dwelling place. You're a powerhouse of the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he will flee from you. &gt;&gt; Why don't you go ahead and put your faith into action? You're a part of this third pull. &gt;&gt; My children are saved. &gt;&gt; My children are going to make the rapture. Sir, &gt;&gt; I say my children are going to receive the token. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am the revival. &gt;&gt; It is for my pastor. It is for my pastor's wife. It is for my pastor's family. It's for my family. It's for my church. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now listen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it too, buddy. You go confessing it. &gt;&gt; In the day of my power, my people will be spontaneous. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; My people &gt;&gt; will be willing &gt;&gt; to take a step upon the water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't you hear the savior call? Come. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of spooks. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of looking at the Holy Ghost move as spooks. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of seeing Christ walking on the sea of humanity in my life and getting scared. I say step out of the boat. &gt;&gt; Get out of your comfort zone. Get out of your complex. Get out of your fear. Get out of the confusion. Claim it for your as your inheritance. Walk into it. Speak to the sun. Speak to your mountain. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you're sure bold." I'm telling you, we're in the season of it. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I'm not under justification. I am not a stalk. I'm not a tassel. I'm not a shock. I am weak. The same ministry of Jesus Christ that was waved over us through a vindicated word prophet is now in my life. And I say it's my inheritance. Let the prodals come home. Let the marriages be healed. Let the let the churches receive revival. It's rapture time. Rapture faith in rapture grace. Don't be feared of the past. &gt;&gt; That was another season. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I wish I could preach it the way that I see it. &gt;&gt; Quit being fearful of repeating the past. This is another season. &gt;&gt; You know why people make so many mistakes? Because they get fearful. &gt;&gt; But perfect love came to take out fear. And perfect love is grace. &gt;&gt; And we are made perfect in love. &gt;&gt; And faith works by love. &gt;&gt; And I release my faith in God's perfect love for my life. And I say the grace of God &gt;&gt; is all over me. &gt;&gt; It's all over you. Now, &gt;&gt; now we're we're we're still getting somewhere &gt;&gt; because the prophet of God says, &gt;&gt; he says that Joshua &gt;&gt; when he stopped the sun, he didn't even think about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He just knew that &gt;&gt; he was told to defeat these this enemy. &gt;&gt; And that if they could go regroup, &gt;&gt; he'd lose more men. &gt;&gt; So just spontaneous in the day of my power, my people will be willing. And so just because he understood his position as a Joshua generation, &gt;&gt; you're a Joshua generation. &gt;&gt; He simply just says, "Well, I can't have this, &gt;&gt; and I'm anointed as the leader, &gt;&gt; so I'm just going to say, son, &gt;&gt; stand still. Moon, you stay where you're supposed to be. and it stayed there for 24 hours &gt;&gt; and he didn't even think anything of it. &gt;&gt; Now maybe on maybe later on he went whoa &gt;&gt; but right then he had a need for it. &gt;&gt; There's some of us that's got needs &gt;&gt; that are that are as high as Mount Everest &gt;&gt; and you're so scared to speak to that thing &gt;&gt; because it's got you bluffed. But I'm here to tell you that Mount Avarest demon is nothing &gt;&gt; but a whoop devil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet and Jesus told us how to get rid of that thing and that is to speak to it. &gt;&gt; Quit cowering to it and speak with the faith of God and cast it into the sea. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I tried but nothing happened." It happened. It was just only a teaspoon. And then the devil came back and bluffed you into unbelief again because you didn't see anything happen. And the prophet of God says God never promised me us miracles. He promised us results. &gt;&gt; And that could be a teaspoon at a time. &gt;&gt; But it'll get to a shovel &gt;&gt; and then it'll get to a wheelbarrow and then it'll get to a semi. &gt;&gt; It may not happen in one day. It might not be one year. It may not be in 10 years. But it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; I'm so &gt;&gt; And here I go again. &gt;&gt; I'm so sick of preaching about the third pull, which is the opening of the word, which is to give us rapturing faith in grace. &gt;&gt; And there's always a hashtag, be careful with it. That was free. &gt;&gt; You see the prophet of God says where the ministers failed. He says in this last revival where the ministers there is where we fail. There is where the church fails. When this revival that we just had, now this is 63 in paradox. He says, "This revival that we've just had, this great campaigns that started across the country, when we had the enemy running, &gt;&gt; we should have kept him on the run." &gt;&gt; Now, I'm telling you, the prophet of God says, "I've seen his tail lights go over the hill." &gt;&gt; A prophet said that. A vindicated word prophet told you that your enemy is nothing but a bluff and he's defeated &gt;&gt; and he's running from you. &gt;&gt; And then here the prophet of God now that was in that was in 53. Now he is telling you 10 years later the problem with this last revival is we had him on the run &gt;&gt; and we let up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you know the prophet of God also said &gt;&gt; he says that he will weep with those who weep. &gt;&gt; He will laugh with those who laugh &gt;&gt; and he's in victory with those who is in victory. Let's keep him in victory. &gt;&gt; I just want to say that when I read that quote, I took a vow. God, &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep the devil on the run. Right. &gt;&gt; I believe the devil's defeated. &gt;&gt; I believe that cancer's defeated. &gt;&gt; Discouragement's defeated. &gt;&gt; Spirits that are trying to wear you down and oppress the saints is defeated. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And I say this bride's revival has got the devil on the run. And for one, this preacher is going to keep him on the run. I say let's keep him in victory. &gt;&gt; If you want to if you want to have a sob story about your blues and about all the problems in life, he'll actually come along and he'll cry with you. &gt;&gt; If if if you want to say, you know, everything's falling apart and and that's the kind of high priest you're wanting, then that's what he'll be to you. But if you're looking for victory &gt;&gt; and you're and you're looking to wave this bloodstained banner and say this is the mighty conqueror. He's already conquered death, hell, and the grave. Then that conqueror is here. &gt;&gt; I say let's keep him in victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan, you lost. &gt;&gt; We're coming over now. We're marching over into the promised land. What is that? What is this mountain before Zerubabel? Who is this stands before there? You'll become a plane. Why with a two-edged sword will chop her to the ground? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're under the ministry of Zerubab. &gt;&gt; How do you defeat the devil? With the word. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God says as much faith as will be released, that's how much power you can have. Now, I I'm closing. I built it all up to this. The prophet of God, Brother John, I read this the other day, and I I I I've read it many times, heard it many times. But when I read it, it did something to me. The prophet of God in the message of grace, if you haven't heard in a while, it probably do you do you good. Go listen to it. Brother Brandham says that he was hunting. He went out hunting and it was still dark out. He said it was rainy. He said as he was going out in the woods there he said he seen three rainbows come up. He said went about 30 feet tall and he goes through that. He said and then after that experience there he was in the presence of God. He said then something turned him around. He said he looked. He said and there was that tree that the year before he spoke those squirrels into existence. Y'all remember that? &gt;&gt; You remember when the prophet of God said that he was thinking on that scripture &gt;&gt; that if you say under this mountain, he's meditating upon that, how could that be? And that was before redemption, all these things. And and then he took him to Moses speaking the word and then all of a sudden he heard that voice &gt;&gt; and brother Bam's talking to that voice and then all of a sudden he gets he spins around and says, "Who's there? Who's there?" Y' y'all remember that? Yeah, &gt;&gt; he was so beside himself. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "What do you need your hunting game? What do you need?" And he speaks the squirrels into existence, he tells them, "Well, exactly what it's going to how it's going to happen." And remember, he said he got so excited that that squirrel ran down and before it got to the place that he said, he just pulled the gun up and shot and he missed. &gt;&gt; Y'all remember that? &gt;&gt; He said and and he shot and then he Oh, wait. I said that it'll happen this way. And he then he went over there and he shot and he hit the squirrel. That was a year earlier. Now the prophet has come to that same tree and he's and he's described the tree and he said all of a sudden here comes that same voice and he says, "What would you have now? &gt;&gt; What do you have need of?" He said, "Oh, now notice he doesn't spin around now. Now he's confident. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, I guess just like last year, &gt;&gt; the limit." He said, he said, "Then speak it." He said, "I'll have the limit by 10:00." He said, "And then he said there was there was just a nest of of of of uh what are those?" Mosquitoes. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Not one of those will trouble me the rest of the day. He said, "And then in 30 minutes the sun will come out." He said, "Every single one of those things happened." Exactly. &gt;&gt; He said later on in the day, he said, "I I I I heard a a noise." He said, "Oh, there's one, a mosquito." He said, "I stopped and I listened." He said, "It was just a truck on a road way off in the distance, the word." But he said no sooner than he had spoke that he said all the sudden he heard something behind behind him and he said it was a chatter chatter chatter. &gt;&gt; He said oh he said I turned around. He said there was a young red squirrel just like last year. &gt;&gt; He said it was about 70 yards away. He said I just put up my gun. He said with that high powered scope, he said I could barely even see the eye. He says I just through those powerful scopes see his eye. He said just shot. That's all. I didn't even have an aim at no more than over the squirrel and the bullet was just exactly smack at the eye where it was the other time. Brother Ben, when I read that, I went, "Whoa, &gt;&gt; wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Who told the prophet, how did the inspiration strike his heart &gt;&gt; that he didn't have have to calculate the distance? &gt;&gt; He didn't have to measure how far he's going to have to aim over that squirrel to hit it in the eye. He can barely even see the eye. But the prophet says, "All I had to do is no aim. just raised it over the squirrel and pulled the trigger and it hit it exactly in the eye. &gt;&gt; I thought, "My goodness." Last year he was wondering, "How's this going to all happen?" Even missed a squirrel. This year he doesn't even hardly aim. &gt;&gt; Just push it up, &gt;&gt; pulls the trigger, &gt;&gt; and shoots the squirrel in the eye. And you know where he's telling us this now? He's going to take us to Zerubabel, Zechariah the 4th chapter, &gt;&gt; and he's going to preach &gt;&gt; a message of grace from this experience. &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord, the spirit of the Lord, as I begin to meditate on that, the spirit of the Lord just quickened. He says, you know, that's scriptural. I began to think of David and how that when David just a little old ruddy boy. &gt;&gt; He wasn't a part of the army. &gt;&gt; They didn't want him because he was too scrawny. &gt;&gt; But God had him on the back side of the desert. &gt;&gt; And he was he was entertaining omnipotence. &gt;&gt; The presence of God would come down and David would begin to sing songs while he was watching over the sheep. And then all of a sudden, here come a lion and took one of the sheep and something quickened David and he grabbed that and he didn't run. He was a shepherd boy anointed with the presence of God and he took that slingshot and he ran after that lion and he and he slung that stone and he smoked that lion and he killed it. Another experience came with the bear. He chased that bear, he killed it. &gt;&gt; Now he's also been anointed king. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's still a secret. But there he comes into the presence of his brethren. And his brethren, which is supposed to be the mighty army of the living God, is all cowarding down, hiding behind rocks. &gt;&gt; And David is looking around saying, "What in the world is this?" &gt;&gt; What's wrong with y'all? &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh, David, you better get down and hide because there's a giant over there." And about that time, that old big big old ugly giant &gt;&gt; stands up and begins to make his boast. Notice how he makes his boast. I challenge the armies of Saul. &gt;&gt; Now, David turns around and says, "We're not the armies of Saul. We're the armies of the living God." &gt;&gt; Who is this uncircumcised Philistines? &gt;&gt; That he would defy the armies of the living God. You know what the rest of them were doing? They were they were identifying themselves with the head of their organization. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it took David to recognize a cause to tell his brethren, we are still the armies of the living God. &gt;&gt; And about that time, Amen. Goliath is saying it's been 40 days. 40 days is judgment. 40 is judgment. &gt;&gt; 40 days they've been under that thing, hiding day after day. Day after day. But all the sudden, David says, "I'll go fight him. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't do that. They're speaking naughty. They're speaking against him. We know your hearts. We We know that you've you've got you've got a motive." &gt;&gt; He says, "Is there not a cause to see a living God in action today?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saul tried to put his armor on him and says, "I've not tried that ecclesiastical armor. &gt;&gt; I'll go with what I'm trained in." The prophet of God says the anointing of the Holy Ghost was upon David and he be to dance. &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up, friends. David be to dance in the spirit into the battle. &gt;&gt; He said that by faith he saw that giant falling down and he spoke it. You will fall at my feet. &gt;&gt; David just began to dance. [Music] &gt;&gt; He danced all the way to the brook. &gt;&gt; So anointed of the Holy Ghost that he knew he couldn't fail. He couldn't lose because he was anointed for this season of grace. &gt;&gt; And he reached down there and he got five smooth stones. And then he just went on dancing to the battle. This is what your prophet said David did. &gt;&gt; And he danced all the way to the battle. He put that stone in that sling. And David said, "Oh, a scrawny little runny boy." Amen. Coming to do war against me. I'm going to put you on the end of my spear and I'm going to put you up for the fowls of the air. And David said, "You're going to be like one of them." &gt;&gt; He spoke it. Prophet of God. Why cry? Speak. He spoke it. &gt;&gt; And then he went forward to make good what he spoke. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet of God said by faith he already saw the victory. &gt;&gt; All of his brethren. &gt;&gt; Look at him. Look at that holy roller. Look at that fanatic. Does he know he's in the valley? &gt;&gt; Doesn't he know he should be discouraged? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; The bigger they are, the harder they fought. &gt;&gt; And then the prophet of God says that when he released that stone, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost got a hold of that stone. [Music] and the Holy Ghost. Amen. That stone went a thousand miles an hour and it hit the only place it could hit that was not armored, right between the eyes. When I seen that, I thought, "Oh my goodness, he didn't even have to aim." All he had to do is have confidence in grace. All he had to do is to believe that this is his season of grace. This is his season of victory. Just let it go. You know what the prophet of God says? He says, "Why are you putting the gun over the mantle and saying, "Oh, look at my gun. It's a pretty gun." He says, "Get the gun off of the mantle. Put it on the devil and squeeze the trigger." &gt;&gt; Why are we scared to pull the trigger? &gt;&gt; Well, I've got my complexes. Well, I just don't know all the quotes just right. When are you ever? &gt;&gt; When are you ever? &gt;&gt; Please tell me. &gt;&gt; Cuz I want to go to your school so I can get better. &gt;&gt; Because we are not under law. &gt;&gt; We're under a season of grace &gt;&gt; and we need to believe that we're in a Holy Ghost move. And if you will stay on the stay in the word and speak the word, the Holy Ghost will get a hold of it. Well, &gt;&gt; I'm just so uncertain. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I just, you know, I just little old me. I can't fulfill the promise, and I don't know if I can pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Well, it's for the pastor. Get in the wheelbarrow. &gt;&gt; Well, the pastor's got all faith. That's not what the prophet said. He said, "You get in the third pole. You get in the wheelbarrow and put your faith into action. &gt;&gt; I'm not joking. &gt;&gt; We've got we we're so tied up in fear. &gt;&gt; I just don't know if I can do it. And just like those denominations &gt;&gt; that have caused the people to live a million miles below their privileges that they're still the people of so many people are still wondering if we got rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; And they keep going back to the same old quote. Well, we can't have faith for a headache hardly. How are we going to have faith for the rapture? They couldn't have faith for a headache because the denominations were saying they couldn't believe for it. But we've been liberated. &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. And he sent the spirit of truth to get into our hearts to teach us to believe for all things. &gt;&gt; But not only that, this is a different kind of a grace. This is rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; It's time to pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Put another bullet in it. Pull the trigger. Put another promise in the barrel. Pull the trigger. Just keep pulling it. Just keep pulling it. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's time to get our dance back. &gt;&gt; It's time to realize we're in the victory. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I I I just want to read this because I think it'll help someone. You see, you see, Goliath made his boast and then he said, "Here I come in the name of the Lord." And the prophet of God says, "David didn't have to get all prayed up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to pray through. &gt;&gt; He was already prayed through. &gt;&gt; God prayed him through before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; Now, I know that hurts legalist, &gt;&gt; but I got to say what a prophet says. We believe in fasting. &gt;&gt; We believe in prayer meetings. &gt;&gt; But quit trying to label that &gt;&gt; as if that's how we're going to get our victory. &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't fast, so &gt;&gt; no victory for you. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that is an enticing spirit &gt;&gt; that is trying to hinder your faith. that is trying to get you under law &gt;&gt; that well I've got a chart here &gt;&gt; and I got to check this off and check that off and check this off. That is not grace friends. &gt;&gt; But everything we do is out of love &gt;&gt; and God gave us the secrets to victory. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you right now, I'm prayed up. &gt;&gt; I'm prayed up before the foundation of the world for this great victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was anointed for the job. He had to speak and go forward. That's all there was to do about it. Just speak and go and speak and go forward. That's all there was to it. Now, the prophet of God says he spake and took over the situation that day. If there ever was a time that man should speak, &gt;&gt; it's now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, God, now the prophet of God said that God has raised up a generation for the last great kill. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that the power of the Holy Ghost is the word in flesh in you and I. &gt;&gt; And I believe that I am looking at a generation of Goliath killers. I'm looking at a generation that is more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at a generation that knows that they can take this message and this word and push it out there with a perfect faith and a perfect confidence that the Holy Ghost will take a hold of it because you don't have the wrong motive. &gt;&gt; You don't have the wrong objective. Your heart is pure &gt;&gt; and you believe that God has sent you a message &gt;&gt; for your victory &gt;&gt; and your overcoming grace. &gt;&gt; Then speak. Speak. You say, "Brother Jonathan, I just get so scared. What am I supposed to speak?" Well, okay. Let's just let's just line us up on the target because the prophet of God's took us through a little life example. You remember he he had a he had a 22 and he shot it through the same hole nine times and actually had it sick ass signed as proof and then he went and he went to shoot a squirrel and he hid in the body or missed and he got all tore up and then come to find out that his wife was saying well the Winchester company says that that that it's not supposed to do what you're saying it's to do and brother Blam says but I've always I've already proved it and there He was sitting in the woods. All the other brothers could hit a squirrel anywhere. And he's crying and he's saying, "God," he was so tore up and nervous. He said, "God, why did you make me this way?" And God said, "I made you thus because you you're made this way because you know that if it hit once, it'll do it again." And you know, if Paul hit the mark &gt;&gt; Yeah. and you line it up on the same gospel that Paul preached, it'll hit the mark. &gt;&gt; Now, Revelation 10:7, the mysteries are revealed, but Revelation 10:8-11, the bride is go to is to go to that covenant angel and take that book of redemption &gt;&gt; and is to eat the book &gt;&gt; and is to prophesy again. So, I'm I'm I'm telling you, you want to know what to speak? &gt;&gt; We have got a vindicated message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Start speaking it. &gt;&gt; Start confessing it. &gt;&gt; Because confess is to say the same thing as. And if God vindicated this prophet, he's going to vindicate this bride. &gt;&gt; And I say we've got every right. It's our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Step into it. &gt;&gt; You're anointed for this last great kill. &gt;&gt; You're anointed to kill devils. You see, the prophet of God says, "And let the musicians come to give you some hope." He says, "You know, it's a true shooting gun. I hang it up on the wall and oh sure, I got a gun." I just paraphrased this. He says, "What do you do with it?" He says, "It hangs on the wall." Said, "That's faith." People say, "Oh, I'm a Christian. Oh, I believe God can." But what do you do about it? Put it to work. Turn it loose. Do something with it. Get out and hunt up the devil where he says you still hurting. You got to hunt him up and say you're a liar. &gt;&gt; Pull the beat on him. Get him in the scope. Don't be afraid to pull the trigger cuz it'll go off as sure as anything. You know what you got to have? You got to have this kind of an attitude. I didn't say arrogance now, but a kind of attitude. The right mental attitude toward any divine promise will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Just take the word of God and cut your way through every doubt." &gt;&gt; You see it? Sure. That's it. If that's the next job, let's get it done. &gt;&gt; Next thing I know to do is get away from my doubts. Cut it down. That's my next job is get all my frustrations away. If my senses tell me, well, you feel bad. The next thing to do is cut that thing away. That's right. You say, "Well, they tell me, you know, my conscience tell me, Brother Brandon, that I can Well, you might as well cut that thing away. You ain't going to get no further than that. Just get your next job done. Take off your coat and barrel right into it. Just keep on going. One objective. I'm going to win. I can't lose. I'm going to win. &gt;&gt; Now, that's your prophet in the greatest battle ever fought telling you how to deal with symptoms, &gt;&gt; how to deal with discouragement, how to deal with imagination, conscience, reasoning, affections, what you see, what you hear, all your feelings. you you know the this may not mean a whole lot to you but but the prophet of God says how you uh uh brother John was talking about the civil war and and one of the generals was General Grant and he's actually the general the last general that that actually overcome General Lee's army in the south but when he come to Richmond the the prophet of God says how did General Grant overcome Richmond. He says, "Well, he overcome it just how he came to it." What the prophet of God was trying to tell us is the next devil that comes up to you, the next situation in your life, you just defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you're going to want to shout the victory and praise the Lord because God's given you a testimony. &gt;&gt; And to keep that testimony hid in your heart and not tell someone else, that's being ashamed of him. &gt;&gt; So you got to you got to you you got to let the praises out and say, "God's a mighty conqueror." But then you're going to come against a you're going to come against another enemy. And you know how you conquer that enemy? Just the way you come to it. &gt;&gt; You see, you're not fearful. You're not wondering if you're going to fall. You're not wondering if you're going to be defeated. &gt;&gt; You defeat the demons that come against you. &gt;&gt; Is that simple? Am I just too simple? &gt;&gt; So tonight, there's some real situations in your life. &gt;&gt; But you know how you're going to overcome that thing? &gt;&gt; Just the way you come to it. If you've got a if you've been fighting a spirit of depression, then you just stand up to that thing and say, "Satan, I'm taking my unwavering faith &gt;&gt; and I'm saying, Satan, you're not coming back anymore." &gt;&gt; You say, "It's too simple." Well, I'm telling you, he's already left. But it's your faith that's got to stand up to him and say, "Satan, you're a bluff and you're not welcome here any longer." &gt;&gt; Go ahead and just just play something softly. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know, this is a real spirit of grace, and you forgive me for taking too long. I I I I'm sorry for for wearing you out tonight. I I hope I didn't too much, but I it it's it's something that has just been so bubbling up in my soul that I I I'm I'm so overwhelmed by it. You say, "Well, Brother Jonathan, apparently you don't have too many battles." No. I'd say the last couple of years have probably been the greatest battles one after another after another after another that I've ever faced in my entire life. But God has revealed his grace to me and my wife, my children like never before. &gt;&gt; There's people that would have thrown in the towel for me and just said, "Well, looked like that I was going to lose my daughter. Looked like that my wife was being diagnosed with some kind of thyroid and and and and the devil trying to take her out. [Music] But I stand here as a testimony &gt;&gt; of grace. You say, "What gives you the right to preach it that way?" Well, first of all, a vindicated message &gt;&gt; that everything I preached is right here in this message. But I've also experienced it. I've experienced the power of omnipotence. You see, I I've went through that season as well as, well, look at the failings here and look at those over there and look look what they're trying to do. But I've come to a point in my life, Brother Ben, that whatever people's going to do, they can do it. &gt;&gt; But as for me in my house, we're in this promised land, &gt;&gt; and we're going to serve the Lord. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; If if if I if if I just if I'm always worried about what everyone else is doing, if I'm just pushing against what other people are doing, then you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to lose my balance. [Music] &gt;&gt; But you see, I'm standing for something. I'm not fighting against something. I'm standing for something. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm standing for Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; I'm standing here as a witness. I've seen God filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I I I've seen the Holy Ghost take a hold of young people and so transform their lives and change their natures. And &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, people would have would was actually want to give up on them. I've got a cousin that that ever since he was a young boy had been in had went in drugs and and and had become a heroin addict. Got married to a girl that for a birthday present I I believe it was a birthday present. Her grandmother gave her uh drugs as just a little girl. teeth all rotted out, liver bat, just an addict. But when they were homeless, something happened and my cousin said, "You know, I know I know I have a cousin and told him about my brother and his church." And they were over there a thousand or so miles away, homeless. He said, "But I if we could just scrape up enough money to get a bus ticket, I believe if we go there, we can get some help." And and and and they come there and I'm tell we had been through a whole a whole lot, many years, but grace came down and my brother and the church there began to love him. And it didn't happen overnight, but by the grace of God, that's been about eight years ago. And they've been sober. God took away the addiction out of their life. [Applause] Not only that, but she needed a liver transplant. And when she went back to the doctor, the doctor had been her doctor for a long time. And the and the doctor the doctor's just frustrated with her, but she says, "I I want you to check me." And says, "I I've already checked you before." And D, just aggravated. Said, "Oh, I want you to check me again." He says, "When when she went and checked her liver," he said, "I got to check this again." And he went and did another test. He says, "I don't know what happened, but your liver is brand new. [Applause] says, "Well," she's about to leave and she says, "Well, you know, this medication that you've got me on, you know, I I guess I need a refill." She He says, "You don't understand. You didn't hear me. You don't need it any longer. You've got a brand new liver. I don't know what's happened." She said, "I know what's happened. I gave my life to Jesus Christ and he's changed my life. [Applause] I I just feel like sharing just a few uh just just another testimony. I I was there in Canada a few months ago and I'd had my sermon all ready and I went to bed and then the Lord woke me up in the middle of the night and I I I had a little story that was just playing in my head and it was just the lines of you're twice mine. You're twice mine. you're twice mine." And I I'm I'm jogging and I'm thinking, "What what is that about?" And I thought, you know, it seems like I heard a story like that. And so I actually Googled it and it's about a little boy that built a sailboat and then he took it into the into the stream and he loved that sailboat and and then it got in the current and it took it a long ways away and he lost his sailboat. Then a couple of months later, he was walking down the street and he seen his little sailboat in the pawn shop and he ran in the pawn shop and he and he said, "Hey, that's my sailboat." He said, "Oh, no. That's my sailboat. I'm the one that found it." He said, "How much is it?" He said, "It's $5." He said, "I want you to hold it for me. Please hold it for me." He ran and and he got he got his piggy bank and he broke it open and he counted it exactly $5. He took that money and he went to the pawn shop and he paid for it. He took the boat and he said, "You're twice mine. You were mine when I made you and you're mine now when I bought you." Hallelujah. I thought, "This is strange. I've not heard that story for years." I told the pastor that morning, I said, "As we were driving to church, he I told him, I said, 'You know, something odd happened last night. I had my sermon already, but God changed the whole thing around." He said, "It's God. He's going to do something this morning." As as we were going to the front, he said, "I told you God's going to do something. I'll tell you later." I got up there. I preached. We had a powerful powerful service. But I be I began to notice that there was a young lady over there in the back and my she was trying. She was resisting. She had makeup all over, cut hair. I mean, she had so much makeup on her face and eye shadow and bless her heart. As I be to preach and I noticed that her lip was quivering, but she was fighting it. And it come to the very last part of that sermon. And I told about that story at about that time the floodgates open. She come to the front. She had lost the battle. The tears, the eye shadow, the makeup was all just, it was just a runny mess. But she she was a part of a church split and her life had become a wreck and she lived about six hours away. But it just so happened that it was her birthday and she wanted to come into this town in St. John's, Newfoundland. and she wanted to come into town to go to dinner for her birthday. So, she told her family, "I want to go to that little church and go to eat." And God got a hold of her life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Just another just another testimony. Amen. I preached again. I was in Canada and I was at brother Ed Hammermeister's church and as I preached and and and and the anointing was just so thick and just the people worshiping. I had just went over there and I sat down and I was just worshiping and then here come a young lady. She'd come to the front. She had piercings on her face and everything else. But then she began to just she's weeping and come to find out her testimony and how that she had been running from God and but God got a hold of her and she repented and came back to God and said, "I'm tired of this. I'm tired of running. I want to serve Jesus Christ." We're in a season of grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne Lawson was preaching at Tim at Brother Tim Puit's church and and and he was actually it was when they were building his church, Brother Tim's church, and brother Wayne knows how to work do dirt work and and he he was there on a Wednesday and he had come in to do some of their dirt work and it was getting late and it was later than than he was anticipating and he had to preach that night and he was thinking, "My I've got to get this done and I got to get some notes prepared." And all of a sudden he said that God spoke to his heart. Something supernatural is going to happen tonight. Just rest. He said, "Brother Wayne just went on." He said, "Okay." Then just went on went on and did the dirt work. Barely made it made it back home. Got dressed for church and came in. Didn't even look at any notes. But the power of almighty God fell that night on a Wednesday night. Had an impromptu prayer line. There was a young lady that came up and said, "My brother, I've got a burden for my brother. He He's in a rock and roll band. He's ran from church. He don't even go to church any longer." And they prayed right then. Said that young man, unbeknownst to them, that young man was home in bed. And because that the service had had ran, it actually ran over five hours on a Wednesday night and he woke up and mom and dad wasn't home and and he panicked and you know what his first thought was? The raptures took place and I've missed it. He said he got a hold of the he got a hold of I I I got the phone and he called a deacon and the deacon didn't answer and he said I've missed it. He said there he was in his pajamas and he got in his in his feet to a vehicle. He began to sobb and cry. He said, "I can't miss the rapture." And he began to he began to run to the church and he actually missed a turn and went and went off the road and went into a fence and knocked the fence down and wiping tears. and he got back on the road and he came back and and he got into the church parking lot and there just so happened to be a deacon that had stepped outside and he seen that young man turning that corner flying came into the parking lot threw it in park and and and he got out and he's like well there's that young man and he went out there and that young man just fell on his knees and he said I got to get right with God I don't want to miss the rapture. I want to get right with God. They had just prayed for him 30 minutes ago. &gt;&gt; And that young man comes walking up the aisles in his pajamas. [Music] &gt;&gt; And that whole family comes to the altar and they rededicate their lives to Jesus Christ. And he's still serving God, filled with the Holy Ghost, married and having a victorious life. That's the gospel we're proclaiming. Let the dead bury their dead. But as far as the church of the living God, we are proclaiming the good news. We are pressing. We are pressing toward the mark. And we can't miss. Are you hearing me, church? It's time to let your faith loose. Believe for the impossible. Pull the trigger. You can't miss. I'm just wondering if you need prayer tonight. I invite you to come. You need prayer. You've got something in your life. You say, "Well, you you've taken on We're at a camp meeting. &gt;&gt; We're a family camp." If you've got something that you've been struggling with, I'm telling you, doomed devils are on the run. and this is your hour and this is your season of grace. But you've got to turn your faith loose. But I believe that if there's something in your heart that says, I I'm going to come in with a heart of faith, a perfect faith, saying, "God, I believe your word. I believe you'll come up here and you'll leave here totally different. You'll be totally changed. I don't care if it's pornography addictions or any other addiction. I don't care if it's alcohol, it's drugs. I I I don't care if it's a religious spirit. [Music] If you need to pray through at an altar and receive the Holy Ghost, then come and pray through. &gt;&gt; Why wait? &gt;&gt; But come knowing it's a promise. The prophet of God said that when I pray for someone needing the Holy Ghost, he said, "I don't I don't shake them. I don't beg for it. I don't demand it. I just simply say, God, you promised it. It's a promise." Ministers, why don't you come? Brothers and sisters, I'm telling you, this is your season of grace. It's time to have faith in grace. I'm telling you, it's time to have faith in grace. It's not by your works. is not by your power, but here in the season of the son of man, will he find faith to come to that judge, that wicked one with supreme authority over your life and say, "God, I believe the promises." If you want to if you're if you're if you got a need, &gt;&gt; I'm not going to beg you, &gt;&gt; but I'm telling you, there's a special anointing there. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, it's grace. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Let's just um stand this evening. We'll just sing. Turn your eyes upon Jesus. [Music] Jesus [Music] on the earth will grow straight.
