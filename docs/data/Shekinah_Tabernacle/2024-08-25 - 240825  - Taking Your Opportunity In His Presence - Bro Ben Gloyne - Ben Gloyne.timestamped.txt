[5:59] Good morning.
[6:02] God bless you all this morning. How are
[6:03] you? Good.
[6:05] Happy.
[6:08] Be like brother. He's always happy.
[6:13] Let's stand. And I've got a Bible verse
[6:15] this morning. It's um Psalm 40:es 1-3.
[6:20] And it says, "I waited patiently for the
[6:21] Lord, and he inclined unto me and heard
[6:23] my cry. He brought me up also out of an
[6:26] horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and
[6:28] set my feet upon a rock and established
[6:31] my goings or my steps. He hath put a new
[6:34] song in my mouth, even praise unto our
[6:36] God. Many shall see it and fear, and
[6:39] shall trust in the Lord."
[6:42] It says here, "Put a new song in my
[6:44] mouth."
[6:46] When you're a bit of a songwriter,
[6:49] sometimes I I say I think to myself, I
[6:51] think, you know, in heaven there must be
[6:52] a lot of songs there that we haven't
[6:54] heard. A lot of new songs. And if I want
[6:57] to try and write a new song, it doesn't
[6:58] always happen this way, but maybe it has
[7:00] once you you say, "Lord, can I can I
[7:03] just have one? Can you just give me one
[7:05] of the songs that you that everyone is
[7:06] singing up there and give it you'll just
[7:08] enjoy it so much. It's a new song. It
[7:10] just and it will say everything that you
[7:11] feel, everything that you want to the
[7:12] way you want to worship, everything. It
[7:14] will just express it in a perfect way.
[7:16] It'll be a new song. Amen. Let's just
[7:18] pray this morning.
[7:21] Lord, we thank you that we have such
[7:22] glorious hope in you, Lord, that we're
[7:25] not following just cunningly devised
[7:28] fables,
[7:30] Lord, that are made up by somebody,
[7:32] Lord, but we we come to the living God
[7:35] this morning and we follow, Lord, the
[7:37] true and living God. We hear the word of
[7:40] God, Lord. And we just thank you so much
[7:42] for your truth, Lord. And we believe,
[7:46] Lord, that you are the way, the truth,
[7:48] and the life, Lord, and you're the
[7:49] mighty conqueror this morning, Lord,
[7:51] over everything that that would come
[7:53] against your word, Lord. You're the
[7:55] mighty conqueror, Lord. So, we just want
[7:57] to submit to you this morning. May you
[7:58] bless us in a powerful way. May you
[8:00] bless the ministry. Bless the songs,
[8:03] Lord. And may you just continue to put a
[8:04] new song in our heart, Lord. A song of
[8:06] praise, a song of worship, Lord, a song
[8:09] of victory, song of rejoicing.
[8:12] We just thank you so much, Lord, for for
[8:14] what you've done for us and for bringing
[8:15] us thus far. And we just love you and
[8:17] trust you with all of our heart, Lord.
[8:18] We just commit the service to your hands
[8:20] in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Praise

[36:32] musicians. Thank you very much, brother
[36:34] Isaac. Thank you all. Amen. Let's uh
[36:36] turn to the scripture this morning.
[36:38] We're going to go to uh John
[36:49] And we're going to read
[36:52] we're going to read John chapter 1 and
[36:54] verses 1 to4 here.
[37:08] Now I know this is all very familiar I'm
[37:10] sure to to everyone. We're just going to
[37:14] start here. It says, "In the in the
[37:16] beginning was the word and the word was
[37:19] with God and the word was God. The same
[37:21] was in the beginning with God. All
[37:23] things were made by him and without him
[37:25] was not anything made that was made. In
[37:28] him was life and the life was the light
[37:31] of men." Amen. May the Lord bless his
[37:33] word. Let's uh bow our heads in a word
[37:35] of prayer this morning. If you ever need
[37:36] say, "Lord, don't pass me by today. Come
[37:38] meet me, Lord Jesus, today." Amen.
[37:41] Gracious Father, you see Lord all the
[37:42] hands that are raised. We just want to
[37:44] invite you this morning to where we're
[37:45] at today. May come speak to our hearts,
[37:48] Lord. May this be a very personal
[37:49] service. I pray. May you come and take
[37:51] supreme control over all of our lives.
[37:53] Sort of plead your blood over the
[37:55] service, dear God. Us here and those who
[37:57] are watching. May you just take complete
[37:59] control. We surrender our beings into
[38:00] your hands. We want to thank you. We can
[38:02] come into your great um your great
[38:04] supreme presence, Lord. Your great
[38:06] presence, oh God. Just pray, dear God,
[38:07] that you touch our lives. Have your way,
[38:09] Father. Those who are sick and body, may
[38:11] you heal them, Lord Jesus. Those who are
[38:13] troubled, whatever is going on in life,
[38:15] I pray that your anointing would come
[38:16] and take away every enemy, Lord Jesus.
[38:19] And may you prove your word today in our
[38:20] midst for your glory. In Jesus Christ's
[38:23] name we ask. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[38:25] friends. You can have your seats this
[38:26] morning. So, I want to take a want to
[38:28] take a a a uh title if I could about
[38:31] taking our opportunity in his presence.
[38:33] Now, this is a very uh important because
[38:37] you got to really think why do we come
[38:38] to church? It's more than just to hear a
[38:40] preacher preach more to hear than just
[38:42] sing or you know sing songs and that's
[38:44] all the natural part of it. But there's
[38:46] a supernatural element to this message
[38:48] which is actually the most important
[38:49] element. Amen. Where our our Lord Jesus
[38:52] Christ is brother's battle cry was Jesus
[38:54] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[38:57] forever. So he is the same as he was
[38:59] when he was standing there and talking
[39:01] to the woman at the well. He's the same
[39:03] God today and all of his power, his
[39:05] ability, his promises. Amen. Everything
[39:07] he is is exactly the same. It's just his
[39:10] corporal body's not here. We're going to
[39:11] meet him in the air. But his presence is
[39:13] here. His word is here. And his word has
[39:16] creative power. Amen. It's not just the
[39:18] words of a of a man, but you know, um,
[39:21] his word is creative power. In the
[39:22] beginning, you know, we didn't read it,
[39:24] but you read Genesis 1 and 1, you know,
[39:26] and, you know, verse one and verse two
[39:27] and so on. He says, you know, let there
[39:28] be the sun, let there be the moon, and
[39:31] let there be all these things. And and
[39:34] God believed his own word after you know
[39:36] you know as he spoke it and it became
[39:37] material what he said. Amen. He didn't
[39:39] say let there be you know light and
[39:41] there wasn't any light. Light came into
[39:44] material. Why? Because his word has
[39:45] creative power. He is creative power.
[39:47] Amen. He is the supernatural God. Now
[39:50] the same God that spoke all things into
[39:52] existence. Uh if we could just keep
[39:54] reading down, we drop down to verse 10
[39:56] in John. You don't have to have your
[39:57] Bibles open, but if you want just want
[39:59] to follow, he says he was in the world,
[40:01] and the world was made by him, and the
[40:02] world knew him not. He came unto his
[40:04] own. His own received him not. But as
[40:07] many as received him, to them uh gave he
[40:09] power to become the sons of God, even to
[40:12] them that believe on his name, which
[40:13] were born not of blood, not of the will
[40:15] of the flesh, nor the will of man, but
[40:17] of God. And the word was made flesh, and
[40:19] dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory,
[40:21] the glory is the only begotten of the
[40:23] father, full of grace and truth. So that
[40:26] same word, that same God condescended
[40:28] down and became flesh. Now I'm just
[40:30] going to jump to this day, the same God
[40:33] has become flesh today. Amen. This this
[40:36] word is no longer it's no longer if we
[40:38] can just be back in Jesus' day. No, the
[40:39] same Jesus is here, but now he's in a
[40:41] multimembered body. A he's not just in
[40:43] one man in the redeemer. He's now in his
[40:45] redeemed. Amen. So that same God that
[40:48] made the worlds is in you. Amen. that
[40:50] same creative power. I just I just I you
[40:53] I've probably said this many times, but
[40:54] I just pray it sinks in. We think who is
[40:56] in our midst when we come to church? Who
[40:58] who walks among us? Who speaks to us?
[41:00] Who deals with us when we're driving,
[41:02] when we're maybe brushing our teeth, or
[41:03] you the God begins to deal with us and
[41:05] speak to our hearts? And you know, who
[41:07] who joins us at our family altars? Amen.
[41:09] Who joins us when we read and when we
[41:11] pray? And you know, who's this great one
[41:14] &gt;&gt; that walks among us? Amen. Who is this
[41:16] supreme one who made heavens and earth
[41:18] that is with us? Cuz remember, brother
[41:19] Bram said, "Dear is not just in heaven,
[41:21] it's in you." Amen. So that same God
[41:23] that made all things is in you. Amen. So
[41:26] we got to realize we can't look back in
[41:28] memory lane. Sure, we enjoy what God did
[41:30] yesterday year. We appreciate that. We
[41:32] don't throw away anything he's done. We
[41:33] actually we gather those things with in
[41:36] our hearts and we remind ourselves the
[41:38] same God back there is the same God
[41:40] today. Amen. But we don't look back
[41:42] yesterday saying I wish I could be back
[41:44] there when the same one is with you
[41:45] right now.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I could say he would, you
[41:48] know, I don't want to put words in his
[41:49] mouth, but he'd say, "Why are you
[41:50] looking back in the past when I'm here?"
[41:52] &gt;&gt; The same God that answered prayer there,
[41:54] the same God that found you there, the
[41:55] same God that was with you there is the
[41:57] same God today right here.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, he was made flesh
[42:01] and dwelt among us. Now, as um
[42:05] I was thinking about the woman at the
[42:07] well, you know, you go read John chapter
[42:10] 4. I've got it here, but we won't read
[42:11] it, but you read just just chapter 4.
[42:13] It's about five minutes to read. Okay?
[42:15] Let's just say that that whole thing was
[42:18] literally a five-minute conversation.
[42:20] What caused her
[42:23] to to receive or to recognize
[42:27] God in flesh? What caused her to do it?
[42:30] Because you think about it, the same God
[42:32] that was there was the same God in the
[42:34] synagogues. And he didn't actually do
[42:36] any physical healing to her. He just
[42:39] revealed her life. He began to speak to
[42:41] her. He began to speak about worship and
[42:44] all these things and her response is we
[42:46] know when Messiah cometh he'll do these
[42:48] things and he simply said I'm he and she
[42:51] dropped her water pot she ran into the
[42:53] city and told the men come see a man
[42:55] who's told me all I ever did is this not
[42:57] the Messiah you know not the Messiah but
[42:59] the same God was in the synagogue with
[43:01] the people who are looking for him and
[43:03] there's a man with a withered hand or a
[43:04] woman that was bent over for 15 odd
[43:06] years with an affliction and you know he
[43:08] healed people in their church you know
[43:10] God manifested himself. And they didn't
[43:13] say, "We know where Messiah cometh.
[43:15] He'll do these things." He uh they said,
[43:17] "Get out of here. You shouldn't be
[43:18] healing on our Sabbath day. You're
[43:20] breaking the word." You know, so so what
[43:22] caused what caused her to recognize him
[43:25] when they couldn't recognize him? The
[43:27] actions of the Messiah. I say it's the
[43:29] same thing that's in you that caused you
[43:31] to recognize him in your day. I mean,
[43:34] cuz the word, the anointed word is the
[43:36] Messiah. It's always been through the
[43:37] ages. Amen. When when Noah was anointed
[43:40] with a message, get in the ark, you're
[43:41] going to die. He was Messiah to the that
[43:44] age, he was standing in the ark
[43:46] preaching, get in ark of safety. That
[43:48] was the Messiah manifested in his day.
[43:50] When Noah, I mean, when Moses went down
[43:52] to Egypt, what was he? He was the
[43:53] anointed Messiah for for Egypt. I mean I
[43:56] mean I mean for the Israelites. Is this
[43:58] okay? Right. Well, he was the anointed
[44:00] word for his day, right? And then our
[44:02] Lord Jesus was all the the entire word
[44:04] made flesh.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happens? He says, he
[44:08] says here, he says, "Then Jesus said to
[44:11] them again, this is after he's
[44:13] resurrected, "Peace be unto you. As my
[44:15] father has sent me, even so I send you."
[44:18] Amen. So the same God that sent Jesus
[44:21] went in Jesus, if I put it that way.
[44:23] Amen. And the same God that commissioned
[44:25] him now commissioned the disciples, "And
[44:27] I'm going to go in you and I'm going to
[44:29] send you off into the world." Amen. That
[44:31] your words when you speak under
[44:33] inspiration are not your words, they're
[44:35] my words. Because remember when Adam
[44:37] stood in the garden before the fall when
[44:40] he spoke things happened. He had that
[44:42] place under his entire dominion. He had
[44:45] a perfect oneness with God. Right? I
[44:47] mean it wasn't his carnal desire saying
[44:49] move things. It was actually God's own
[44:51] nature living through him. If he didn't
[44:53] want that tree there say tree move over
[44:54] there. The tree would move and different
[44:56] things and the wind would blow. You
[44:58] know, like brother Brand would
[44:58] dramatize, you know, with Eve was there
[45:00] and you know, that wind would blow and
[45:02] you know, um, you know, Eve would say,
[45:03] "Oh, it's a bit cold." And, you know, so
[45:05] so Adam would say, "Peace be still to
[45:06] the wind." And you know, he had supreme
[45:08] control, right? It was not, it wasn't
[45:11] his carnal self speaking those things.
[45:13] It was God, that deity part of him
[45:15] speaking, right? But then when man fell,
[45:18] then it's when our own human will says,
[45:20] "Well, I want this and I want that and
[45:21] what about this?" and you speak that, it
[45:23] just doesn't come into anything because
[45:26] it's a carnal will speaking, right? But
[45:28] then when man man gets out of the way
[45:30] and God steps in, it's like Moses before
[45:34] the burning bush, he could stand there
[45:36] and say, "Let there be fleas all he
[45:37] wanted. There'd be no fleas coming or
[45:39] let there be frogs or turn the water
[45:41] into blood." He could have done that all
[45:42] he wanted before the burning bush, but
[45:45] it would have been his own own human
[45:47] will speaking, right? And and those
[45:49] words just fall to the ground, right?
[45:51] But then when the Lord commissioned him
[45:52] in the burning bush and said and he
[45:54] says, "I've heard the cries of my people
[45:56] and I'm sending you." And basically God
[45:58] said to Moses, "I've come down to
[46:00] deliver. I'm going to step into you and
[46:02] I'm going to through you do the job."
[46:04] Right? So now under the blood of bulls
[46:06] and goats, Moses by inspiration could
[46:08] say, "Let frogs come and frogs come. Let
[46:12] flies come and flies come." Right? Why?
[46:15] Because because it was the anointed
[46:17] word. Now that creative power that said
[46:19] let there be sun, moon and stars now was
[46:21] speaking through a man. And brother
[46:23] Brand makes a like an incredible
[46:25] statement to me. He says now if a man
[46:26] under under the blood of bulls and goats
[46:29] can be led by God and speak a word and
[46:31] creative power can become material.
[46:33] Amen. How much more are people under the
[46:35] blood of Jesus Christ? How much more are
[46:38] people under a perfect atonement where
[46:40] they're not just their sins aren't just
[46:41] covered but God annihilates their sins.
[46:43] He cleanses them. He dwells in them. He
[46:45] lives through them. How much more are
[46:47] people under the blood of Jesus Christ?
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. To me, it's an incredible thing
[46:52] when you think about that. God God
[46:55] dwells in us and he wants that same
[46:58] anointing, that same logos to speak.
[47:00] Amen. He is the logos, right? He is the
[47:02] word. So now what happens is that in the
[47:04] New Testament era, God steps into a
[47:07] person and speaks his word and then when
[47:10] that is spoken, then that's your
[47:12] opportunity to grab that promise.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a that that's why that's
[47:18] why I said taking our opportunity in his
[47:20] presence. See, brother Bram says that
[47:24] the the pillar of fire is here to
[47:26] release our desires to us. Amen. He says
[47:30] when God steps down into a service, God
[47:33] wants to release your desires to you.
[47:35] Well, what's our desires? Salvation,
[47:37] healing, deliverance, the baptism of the
[47:40] Holy Ghost. Amen. Peace to come. God,
[47:43] the devil to be driven out. healing to
[47:45] come. That's the desires of our heart.
[47:47] Is it Lord? I want to see you live. I
[47:49] want to see your word put on flesh in my
[47:50] life. Lord, I want to see your promises
[47:52] become material. I don't just want to
[47:54] come to church and just have an
[47:56] intellectual conception and go home
[47:58] empty, but I want to go home with
[47:59] revelation. I want to go home with a
[48:01] rock in my soul of revelation that I
[48:03] know that you're more than able to do
[48:05] it. And because remember, when
[48:06] revelation strikes you, you know it's
[48:08] done.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And you're not hoping. Amen. Hope is
[48:11] gone. Faith has taken a hold. And you
[48:13] know it's done. Amen. and you can walk
[48:14] forward in confidence. God, you're in
[48:16] control. I pray that all unbelief and
[48:19] skepticism just just driven from the
[48:21] building right now. I to realize our God
[48:23] is more than able.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's more than able to fulfill his
[48:26] word.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman at the well just had a
[48:30] moment, but she took her moment.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how much more now you and I,
[48:35] as Jesus would even promise, verily I
[48:37] say unto you, whatsoever you shall bind
[48:39] on earth shall be bound in heaven. And
[48:41] whatsoever you shall loose on earth
[48:42] shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say
[48:44] unto you that if two of you shall agree
[48:46] on earth as touching anything. Say
[48:49] anything.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Anything that ye shall ask it shall be
[48:53] done for them of my father which is in
[48:55] heaven. Well how do you agree? It's got
[48:56] to be in your heart. Yes I agree. Not
[48:58] not just in here. How how do we how do
[49:01] we cause that to happen? We create an
[49:03] atmosphere of faith.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're you're an
[49:06] atmosphere generator. You want to walk
[49:08] around like a thundercloud. You'll have
[49:10] a thundercloud atmosphere, frowns and
[49:13] grumpy and everything's wrong and
[49:14] problems and this person did this and
[49:16] this and this. You'll be causing an
[49:17] atmosphere, all right? But it won't be
[49:19] an atmosphere of sunshine, peace, and
[49:21] joy. It'll be a thunderstorm and
[49:22] everyone will be ducking for cover. Here
[49:24] comes hurricane whoever, right? Because
[49:27] we're atmosphere generators. Now, if
[49:29] that's in the negative, how much more in
[49:31] the positive? Amen. How much more in the
[49:33] positive will we can actually allow,
[49:35] Amen, God to take the forefront of our
[49:37] lives. Not our reasoning, not our
[49:39] emotions, not our not not our
[49:41] imaginations, but his word takes the
[49:43] forefront of our minds. Amen. Well, how
[49:45] do we do that? We begin to speak the
[49:47] promises of God. Amen. We speak love. We
[49:50] speak joy. We speak peace. We take the
[49:52] word of God and say, "Lord, anoint your
[49:53] word as I speak it." Amen. And you treat
[49:56] others with love and respect and
[49:57] kindness.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we begin to encourage each
[50:01] other. The Lord is here for you,
[50:02] brother. The Lord is here for you,
[50:04] sister. He's interested in your
[50:06] situation. Amen. He cares about you. He
[50:08] is the same yesterday, today, and
[50:10] forever. He will answer in his time. You
[50:13] don't need to be upset about the
[50:14] lingering promise. Trust me, it will
[50:16] come.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will come. You say, "It's been
[50:19] taken a long time." It will come. Just
[50:21] let revelation anchor in your soul and
[50:24] keep feeding that revelation with praise
[50:26] and joy. Amen. And you'll find the
[50:28] problems won't bother you no more. Why?
[50:30] because there's an anchor in your heart.
[50:32] It's coming. It's already anchored in my
[50:34] heart. God cannot lie. God cannot fail.
[50:38] You say, "Well, my five senses are
[50:40] telling me a lot of things." When we
[50:42] create an atmosphere of faith,
[50:44] the five senses shut up.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz faith is the boss. Faith is supreme.
[50:50] Faith has muscles. Faith has hairs on
[50:52] its chest. Faith is not some bashful
[50:55] little person in the background. No.
[50:56] Faith is rugged. Amen. Faith is shut up
[50:59] five senses. I'm in control. Shut up
[51:01] reasoning. I'm taking the floor. You let
[51:03] faith take the floor. Amen. I'll tell
[51:05] you what, things will begin to take
[51:06] place in your life. Why? Cuz you've
[51:08] chosen, I'm only going to believe.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Faith starts with a choice.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, God can't really do the supernatural
[51:15] no more. The prophet's not here. The God
[51:17] of the prophet. What did he do? The
[51:21] ministry of brother Bram was to
[51:22] introduce the Messiah to the bridegroom,
[51:25] &gt;&gt; right? And not just in an intellectual
[51:27] understanding. Yes, I know he's here.
[51:28] But in reality, I mean, where that same
[51:31] anointing, that same pillar of fire
[51:32] would come and live in your life. Amen.
[51:34] Where the where that transforming power
[51:36] of God, Amen, would take control of your
[51:39] being. Amen. Where your flesh would
[51:41] become subject to it. Amen. Where God
[51:43] would now be walking, talking, living in
[51:45] a people. That's what the message of the
[51:47] hour has come to do. Amen. To restore us
[51:49] back to the position Adam had before the
[51:52] fall. Amen. You say, "Oh, in the
[51:54] millennium when we have new bodies." No.
[51:56] God wants to prove it now.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to prove the power of
[52:00] the blood now. Amen. The full power of
[52:02] Calvary is not just that you're
[52:04] forgiven, though we are forgiven. Amen.
[52:06] Now, the full power of the blood is that
[52:07] God would forgive you, cleanse you, fill
[52:10] you with his word. Amen. That you become
[52:12] a living epistle ready and known of all
[52:13] men. Amen. That these bodies would come
[52:15] to the fullness of adoption, the change
[52:17] of these bodies. Amen. But Calvary is
[52:19] more than just forgiveness. No, it's
[52:21] that God can dwell in you.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So why not open your heart and
[52:24] say, "God, manifest in me the full power
[52:26] of your blood."
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will you come and change my life
[52:29] and live in me and take me from glory to
[52:31] glory, victory to victory?
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we have such a such a
[52:35] great moment this morning. I mean, such
[52:38] a great opportunity when you think
[52:40] about, you know, for where two or three
[52:41] are gathered together in my name, here I
[52:44] am in the midst of them. Amen. That's
[52:45] why we got to start agreeing with the
[52:47] word.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Start agreeing with the word. Don't
[52:49] agree with your circumstances. Don't
[52:51] agree with your problems. No. agree with
[52:53] the word. It doesn't mean we put our
[52:55] eye, you know, we put blinkers on and
[52:56] ignore problems. We see the problem, but
[52:59] we see the promise. Amen. David saw
[53:01] Goliath. He actually pointed Goliath
[53:03] out, but he had a revelation in his
[53:04] heart. This is an uncircumcised
[53:06] Philistine. This guy's going down. He
[53:08] can't hinder us no more. Amen. So, he
[53:10] did not ignore Goliath. He said, "Yeah,
[53:12] you're there, but you're going down."
[53:13] Amen. So, it's got to be the same thing
[53:15] with our problems. You acknowledge it.
[53:16] You Yeah. You say it's there. It's like
[53:18] brother Bram says, you know, about
[53:19] overcoming. You got to recognize the
[53:21] enemy. He says, you know, people say,
[53:23] try and deny sickness and cancer and so
[53:25] on. He says, no, no, no. That's not
[53:26] overcoming. You got to recognize you've
[53:28] got it, but recognize the God in you has
[53:30] already conquered that cancer. Amen.
[53:32] He's already conquered that mind battle.
[53:33] He's already conquered that problem.
[53:35] He's already conquered that anxiety,
[53:36] that fear. He's already conquered it
[53:39] that day on Calvary. And he's here to
[53:41] manifest that victory in your life.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're well aware of the enemy.
[53:45] We're not afraid of him.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; We look beyond him to the promise.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil wants to get up in your
[53:51] grill, up in your face, and just be so
[53:52] intimidating. You got to push him back
[53:54] by the word of God. Oh, God's got to do
[53:56] it. He wants to use you. I mean, he
[53:59] wants to use you for you actually stand
[54:00] on the word yourself. See, faith is an
[54:03] individual thing. I mean, young people,
[54:05] you can't rely on your parents' faith.
[54:07] No, you've got to come to a point where
[54:09] their God is your God. Amen. Where you
[54:11] can stand in the word yourself and say,
[54:13] "No, I'm a Christian. I've been washed
[54:15] in the blood, Satan. Get back in the
[54:17] name of Jesus Christ." Amen. where it's
[54:18] actually no longer just them praying for
[54:20] you, you're praying for them. Amen.
[54:22] You're lifting up your parents saying,
[54:23] "Let's let's go on, mom. Let's go on,
[54:25] Dad." There's greater heights and deeper
[54:26] depths to enjoy in the word of God.
[54:28] Amen. And you begin to create an
[54:30] atmosphere. You're not relaying on the
[54:31] relying on them.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you begin to have your own
[54:35] walk. And I believe you are having your
[54:36] own walk. But take it with all your
[54:38] hands. Take it with both hands. Take it
[54:39] with everything within you. Amen. This
[54:41] is your opportunity
[54:43] &gt;&gt; to shine.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. that God can do what he wants in
[54:48] our lives. Amen. This is this is the
[54:50] young people's time for a revival. This
[54:52] is time for the middle-aged people's
[54:54] time for a revival. Amen. Because the
[54:56] awakening of the bride. Amen. This
[54:57] message awakens the bride to who she
[55:00] really is. Amen. We our eyes come open
[55:02] because we know we are the bride.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like it says in Galatians,
[55:07] you receive the Holy Ghost because you
[55:08] are sons.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; You don't become a child of God by the
[55:12] new birth. No, you are born again
[55:13] because you are Hallelujah.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That takes all the fear out
[55:17] of my life. Amen. No, I'm his son.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; I'm his child. Amen. I've got a right to
[55:22] take him at his word. I've got a right
[55:24] to come into his presence with boldness.
[55:26] Amen. Why? Because he said, "I want you
[55:28] to come."
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he came down the Garden of
[55:31] Eden, when Adam and Eve fell, he was
[55:33] looking for them to restore fellowship.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wanted to, you know, he wanted
[55:37] to bring them back into his presence
[55:39] again.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is why our Lord Jesus
[55:42] manifests himself because he wants to
[55:44] bring you back into fellowship. That you
[55:46] would recognize I'm his son. I'm his
[55:49] daughter. Amen. He can't lose me cuz I'm
[55:51] part of him. I pray that that's just is
[55:54] settled in our hearts as we just go
[55:56] along. May 2025 be the year where it's
[55:58] settled in all of our hearts. I can't be
[56:00] lost. This is the most This world that
[56:03] I'm in now is the closest I'll ever get
[56:05] to hell.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the closest I'm ever going
[56:09] to get to the le regions of the lost is
[56:11] is this plane of existence because I'm
[56:13] I'm a child of God. I ain't going down.
[56:15] I'm going up.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, it doesn't matter if I fall, I'm
[56:18] going to get back up. I'll fail. He'll
[56:20] trip me up. You know, he'll use my
[56:22] desires against me, use my own flesh
[56:24] against me, but I'm going to get back up
[56:25] and I'm going to keep walking cuz I'm
[56:27] his child. Amen. Doesn't matter how
[56:29] disappointed I get in myself. I'm going
[56:30] to get back up and keep walking.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Cuz I'm part of him and he
[56:34] can't lose me.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray that just anchors in
[56:38] all of our hearts.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; See, we live in a condition of victory.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; The blood puts us in that condition.
[56:44] Amen. It puts us puts us in that in that
[56:47] state.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; We've won it all.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he won it all.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's done it all. Now we just
[56:54] enjoy it all.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; So why not enjoy it all?
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why not enjoy his presence?
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have this we have this
[57:04] we have this um opportunity. Brother
[57:06] Bram says, "Do you believe with all your
[57:08] heart the angel of the Lord accompanies
[57:09] the message always?"
[57:11] Amen. So that same one that led Moses,
[57:14] the same one that spoke to the Apostle
[57:17] Paul, the same one that well the angel
[57:19] of the Lord, what is that? That's God in
[57:21] angelic form. Amen. The same one that
[57:24] became flesh as Jesus Christ is now the
[57:27] pillar of fire that was in the upper
[57:29] room in the disciples through the book
[57:30] of acts down through the ages and
[57:32] portion right is here without measure.
[57:35] Amen. And where the anointed word is the
[57:38] angel of the lord is there to accompany
[57:39] the message. And that's more than just
[57:42] to make you feel good. It's more than
[57:44] just to make you feel, you know, happy.
[57:46] It's there that he he's there to anoint
[57:49] that word to your heart
[57:51] &gt;&gt; to fulfill it.
[57:52] This is why he's here. This is why we
[57:54] have church.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That God would inspire a minister,
[57:57] whoever it is, it doesn't matter, but
[57:59] he'd inspire a minister with the needs
[58:01] that we have,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; the questions we have, the things we're
[58:03] going through. Amen. And God inspires
[58:05] them. They don't know what's going on in
[58:07] your life, but you know, it's like
[58:08] you're driving here to church. You begin
[58:09] to talk about something. And then the
[58:11] brother gets up and preaches what you've
[58:13] just talked about or maybe a
[58:15] conversation, maybe the Sunday school,
[58:17] maybe something like that, you know, and
[58:18] then why does God do that? God wants to
[58:21] get your attention. That that's your
[58:23] opportunity. Amen. To take him at his
[58:25] promises. Amen. To to to take that word
[58:27] that you've heard and say, "Lord, that's
[58:29] for me." I mean, you may be going
[58:31] through a real anxious time, trouble at
[58:33] home and questions and what's going on
[58:35] in the world and all these things. And
[58:36] then God begins to come down that line
[58:37] of thought. He's giving you an
[58:39] opportunity. That's where you take faith
[58:42] and say, "Thank you, Lord.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; That's mine."
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like It's like the woman at
[58:46] the well. Amen. Her faith was always in
[58:49] her heart. We know where Messiah cometh,
[58:51] he'll do these things. She was looking
[58:53] for the Messiah, but she had no idea
[58:55] where to look for him. There was
[58:56] something in her that was crying out for
[58:58] expression. Amen. This is you now I'm
[59:01] talking about. I mean, there's something
[59:02] in you crying out for expression cuz we
[59:04] are the woman at the well.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We tried all different kind of
[59:09] religions. We had all whole bunch of
[59:11] dead husbands. Amen. And then, you know,
[59:13] we tried the world. We tried popularity.
[59:15] We tried all these different kind of
[59:17] things. We tried just being a nice good
[59:18] message person. But then one day the god
[59:21] of the message came our way. Why?
[59:23] Because there's an attribute crying out
[59:25] for expression and none of those things
[59:28] could bring it to life. Just like her,
[59:29] you know, she got married the first
[59:31] time. Maybe that was her true love and
[59:32] it all seemed fine. And you know, but
[59:34] but you you maybe that broke up, there
[59:36] was trouble. She was looking for love in
[59:38] all the wrong places, hurt and damaged
[59:39] and you know, but isn't it amazing? Her
[59:42] complexes did not hinder her recognizing
[59:44] Messiah. Her past did not hinder her
[59:47] recognizing Messiah. Her mind battles do
[59:50] not hinder her recognizing Messiah.
[59:52] Nothing that had happened in her life
[59:54] hindered her from recognizing Messiah.
[59:57] And why is that? Because what we
[59:59] recognize them with is not our mind.
[1:00:01] It's not our intelligence. It's not if
[1:00:03] we're having a good day or not or having
[1:00:05] a, you know, a happy time and we have no
[1:00:07] problems. That does not recognize him.
[1:00:10] It's not our spirit realm. It's that
[1:00:12] faith seed. Amen. It's that
[1:00:14] predestinated seed in our soul. Amen.
[1:00:18] Recognizes him.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know she dropped her word. But
[1:00:25] but she had her she had her moment. She
[1:00:29] recognized her opportunity.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Because it's amazing when they first
[1:00:32] start talking, she basically says, "You
[1:00:34] have no dealings with me. You're a Jew.
[1:00:36] I'm a Samaritan. You shouldn't be
[1:00:37] talking to me." And sometimes we maybe
[1:00:39] feel like that with the Lord. Why? You
[1:00:41] have actually no dealings with me, God.
[1:00:42] But I want to do my own thing. She was
[1:00:44] interested in one thing that day.
[1:00:46] Getting water from the well.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; He had one thing on his mind that day.
[1:00:50] Her.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Finding her. Opening her eyes.
[1:00:54] Praise the Lord. It's the same thing
[1:00:56] with us. Normally, we're caught up in
[1:00:58] our little world. Maybe it's just church
[1:01:00] mechanics. Maybe it's just life and
[1:01:02] different things. But then he's got one
[1:01:04] thing on his mind. I'm going to
[1:01:06] interrupt your life.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to talk to you. I'm
[1:01:08] going to reveal myself to you that when
[1:01:10] we finish our conversation, you're not
[1:01:12] going to be the same person that when we
[1:01:14] started that conversation. Amen. That
[1:01:16] burdens will be dropped. Unbelief will
[1:01:17] be gone. Amen. Faith rose in her heart.
[1:01:19] Cuz she she said, "We know when Messiah
[1:01:21] cometh, he'll do these things." And when
[1:01:23] he said, "He that speaks to thee am he."
[1:01:25] She didn't debate that.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; She dropped her water pot because her
[1:01:28] basically her dropping of her water pot
[1:01:30] was a yes, you are.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; I take you at that. Amen. And she ran to
[1:01:34] the city. Why? Because that was her
[1:01:36] opportunity.
[1:01:38] Amen. And she embraced it and she took
[1:01:40] it.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:47] Amen. Brother Bram says that there's
[1:01:50] when the anointing comes into a church,
[1:01:54] I just read this. He says, "This is from
[1:01:56] God hiding himself in simplicity. So
[1:01:57] help me. I can stand right here and go
[1:01:59] down the aisle after I tell you everyone
[1:02:00] where you're at and what you've done. I
[1:02:02] say that in the name of the Lord Jesus."
[1:02:04] You know that's true. And I see you're
[1:02:06] afraid to turn yourself loose. You're
[1:02:09] scared of something that something's
[1:02:12] there's something wrong. God, don't make
[1:02:13] a promise then go back on it. We can't
[1:02:16] be afraid to turn ourselves loose.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; What are we afraid of? This is God
[1:02:21] trying to get our attention because he
[1:02:23] says that the angel Lord will circle the
[1:02:25] building.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Looking looking for an open heart
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; to come and dwell in. Looking for an
[1:02:30] open open heart that he can anoint that
[1:02:32] person and set them free. This is what
[1:02:35] God does. You see, God puts out an
[1:02:37] opportunity, but then we've got to
[1:02:39] receive our opportunity. We got to take
[1:02:40] God at his word at that moment. Amen. We
[1:02:43] can't just expect him because he's got
[1:02:45] because he respects our free moral
[1:02:47] agency. He doesn't force anything upon
[1:02:49] us, but he but he offers an opportunity
[1:02:52] and it's up to us if we'll receive it or
[1:02:54] not.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he says, "You're afraid to
[1:02:57] turn yourself loose." I say, "Let's not
[1:02:59] let fear hinder us anymore." What are we
[1:03:02] afraid of? Whoa. Well, what happens if I
[1:03:05] open up my heart and then I find myself
[1:03:07] dancing around the church? Is that a
[1:03:09] problem?
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Is that a problem?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Or what if I start crying cuz I never
[1:03:14] cry and I just start balling my eyes
[1:03:16] out. Is that a problem?
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; What are we afraid of?
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; What are we afraid of? Because if it's
[1:03:21] God doing it, that's God.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; God had dancing way before the devil had
[1:03:26] it.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. God had shouting way before the
[1:03:30] devil ever had it.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Why let what the devil's done
[1:03:35] with the truth hinder us from the truth?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Look what the Catholics have done with
[1:03:40] Calvary, with the with the birth of
[1:03:42] Jesus. Do we throw it away?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; No. Those things are true.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Then why do we let these things become
[1:03:49] scarecrows about letting God manifest
[1:03:51] himself?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Well, you say that was in a Pentecostal
[1:03:54] age. God adds to his word.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; God adds to his word. He doesn't
[1:03:58] subtract. Amen. So everything they had
[1:04:00] at Isusa, we've got more because we've
[1:04:02] got the indwelling presence of God more
[1:04:04] than just the anointing.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So you So we
[1:04:09] can't be afraid that, oh, but what
[1:04:11] happens if I get begin to act out of
[1:04:13] order or out of character? Let God do
[1:04:16] what he wants to do. Why are we afraid?
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants us. He says, God, don't
[1:04:21] make a promise, then go back on it. You
[1:04:24] know, when we stand here and give out
[1:04:25] promises, I didn't give a single one of
[1:04:27] them.
[1:04:29] Right? The prophet did not give a single
[1:04:31] one a unique promise that he gave. It's
[1:04:33] all from the scripture. It's all God's
[1:04:35] promises being preached.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Right? So, it's not it's not my promise.
[1:04:40] It's his promise. It's not Malachi 4's
[1:04:43] promise. It's God's promise. Right? But
[1:04:45] God inspired it in the season to show
[1:04:47] that the full word of God has come into
[1:04:49] manifestation. So God So if God gave the
[1:04:52] promise, he's the one that will prove
[1:04:54] the promise or bring it to pass.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the truth right here. If you
[1:04:58] want it, it's up to you. It's your
[1:05:00] death. It's your burial. It's your
[1:05:01] expectation. Um I mean I mean it's your
[1:05:04] exception. Uh there's the word. So help
[1:05:05] me. The Holy Spirit is here. So help me.
[1:05:07] Jesus Christ is in here. Have I ever
[1:05:10] told you anything wrong? He's here. But
[1:05:11] there's something I was standing there
[1:05:13] watching that. See that light circling
[1:05:14] right across the building here. Just go
[1:05:16] back and forth. Oh my. There you go.
[1:05:19] That's it. That's the way. Struck a
[1:05:20] little lady over here. That's the way it
[1:05:21] struck another one. There you go. There
[1:05:23] it is. See that? See there's the time to
[1:05:25] accept it while it's here. see glory.
[1:05:28] Amen. It could it would strike some
[1:05:31] here. Praise be to God. There you are.
[1:05:33] Amen. What's happening is the as as
[1:05:34] people open up their hearts and God
[1:05:36] begins to strike them. You can hear them
[1:05:37] as crying out and screaming as God is
[1:05:39] anointing them, changing their lives.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; He's the same God today.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; He hasn't changed. He's the very same
[1:05:45] God with the prophet is the same with
[1:05:46] the bride. He hasn't diminished in
[1:05:48] power, ability, anointing, or anything
[1:05:50] of his strength. He's exactly the same
[1:05:52] God. Amen. It's like, you know, John the
[1:05:54] Baptist introduced the disciples and
[1:05:57] different ones to Jesus, right? And then
[1:06:00] John went off the scene. Jesus went with
[1:06:02] them or they went with Jesus. Brother
[1:06:04] Bram did the same thing. The same
[1:06:06] Messiah, he introduced the the living
[1:06:09] word, the logos, God himself is the same
[1:06:12] God that's with you and I.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:17] Amen.
[1:06:19] Jesus promised that. He says, "Even the
[1:06:22] spirit of truth in the world cannot
[1:06:23] receive because it seeth him not,
[1:06:25] neither knoweth him, but you know him,
[1:06:27] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:06:28] you." This is more than just to the
[1:06:31] disciples. This is to you and I in 2025.
[1:06:34] He says, "He's with you, but he's going
[1:06:36] to be in you." Amen. He says, "I'll not
[1:06:38] leave you comfortless. I'll come to you.
[1:06:40] Yet a while, yet a little while the
[1:06:42] world seeth me no more, but you shall
[1:06:44] see me. Because I live, ye shall live
[1:06:46] also." Amen. At that day you shall know
[1:06:49] that I am in my father, ye in me, and I
[1:06:51] in you. He says, he that hath my
[1:06:53] commandments and keepeth them. He it is
[1:06:55] that loveth me, and he that loveth me
[1:06:57] shall be loved of my father, and I'll
[1:06:59] love him, and will manifest myself to
[1:07:02] him.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Lord never left in 1965.
[1:07:06] He never left in some other year. That
[1:07:09] same God
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; is with us today. I just want this to
[1:07:14] sink in real good. But the thing is this
[1:07:17] the same one that found you is the same
[1:07:20] one that's still with you. Amen. He has
[1:07:22] not left. He is not there part of the
[1:07:24] time. He says he says I will be with
[1:07:26] you. Brother Ram says it's a personal
[1:07:28] pronoun. You may not have thought of it
[1:07:30] that way. He says it's a personal
[1:07:31] pronoun. I will be with you even in you
[1:07:33] to the end of the world. Amen. The world
[1:07:35] won't see me but ye shall see me. Amen.
[1:07:37] And that's how you know you're not of
[1:07:39] the world because you see him. Amen. You
[1:07:41] see I mean God manifest his word. Amen.
[1:07:44] You see God in in his people.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see God in
[1:07:48] yourself. Amen. There. But the world may
[1:07:51] look at you say, "There's nothing
[1:07:52] special about you. What's going on
[1:07:54] here?" You know, you're just a religious
[1:07:56] person. It's cuz they're of the world.
[1:07:58] But those who are of Christ see him.
[1:08:00] They see the message of the hour. They
[1:08:02] see God unveiled.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we all together this morning?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad you're not of the
[1:08:08] world because you can you you see him?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:14] Amen. Brother Brown makes these
[1:08:15] statements. Sorry for a bit of reading,
[1:08:16] then we'll probably go off the reading.
[1:08:17] But I just want to read this. The
[1:08:18] evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:08:20] today. It's just the same as it was back
[1:08:22] uh uh was back in the day of our Lord.
[1:08:24] It was receiving the word of truth for
[1:08:26] the day in which you live. Jesus never
[1:08:28] did stress the importance of the works
[1:08:30] as he did the word. He knew that if the
[1:08:32] people got the word, the works would
[1:08:34] follow that is Bible. Amen. Now Jesus
[1:08:36] knew that there was going to be a
[1:08:37] terrible drift from the word in the
[1:08:39] Pergamian age which was um was as yet
[1:08:43] 200 years from the Patmos vision. He
[1:08:45] knew that that drift would cause him to
[1:08:46] go into the dark ages. He knew that the
[1:08:49] way man originally got away from God was
[1:08:50] by first leaving the word. If you leave
[1:08:52] the word, you have left God. Thus he is
[1:08:54] presenting himself to the church at
[1:08:56] Pergamos and indeed to all churches of
[1:08:58] all ages. I am the word. If you want
[1:09:01] deity in your midst, then welcome and
[1:09:03] receive the word. Amen. What a great
[1:09:05] powerful statement is. If you want, who
[1:09:07] wants deity in their midst? Who wants
[1:09:09] him? Who wants more than religion or a
[1:09:11] nice idea, but who wants the very God of
[1:09:12] glory to be in their midst? Amen. And
[1:09:15] not just at church, but in your everyday
[1:09:16] life. He says, "Then welcome and receive
[1:09:19] the word." Amen. If your thought is
[1:09:21] contrary to the word, lay your thought
[1:09:23] aside. Amen. If your reasoning is
[1:09:25] contrary to the word, lay that aside and
[1:09:27] receive the word. Amen. That's how you
[1:09:29] welcome it. You say, "Lord, your word is
[1:09:30] right and I'm wrong compared to your
[1:09:32] word." Amen. But you welcome and receive
[1:09:34] the word. Don't let anyone or anything
[1:09:37] get between you and that word, which is
[1:09:39] this which I'm giving you. The word is a
[1:09:41] revelation of myself. I am the word.
[1:09:43] Remember that. I wonder if we're
[1:09:45] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:09:47] our midst.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, are we sufficiently are we
[1:09:50] adequately impressed? Are we adequately
[1:09:53] or sufficiently impacted by the word in
[1:09:56] our midst? Oh, it's just a bunch of
[1:09:58] sermons. It's more than that. Oh, it's
[1:10:00] just a bunch of tapes. No, it's more
[1:10:01] than that. Oh, it's just a healing
[1:10:03] ministry. Way more than that. Amen. Now,
[1:10:05] what is it? It is Jesus Christ, the
[1:10:07] Messiah unveiled.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is he? And where is he
[1:10:10] unveiling himself? In his bride body.
[1:10:13] Amen. He's manifesting his word through
[1:10:15] you and I. Amen. It's not just in
[1:10:18] brother Brand's ministry no more. No,
[1:10:19] that same voice is coming to you. Amen.
[1:10:22] That same anointed word is coming to
[1:10:23] you. Amen. So, are we sufficiently
[1:10:26] impressed with that? Well, what is that?
[1:10:28] God himself, creator of heavens and
[1:10:30] earth, deity is in you.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Are we s sufficiently impacted? We
[1:10:36] think, man, I'd love to be back in the
[1:10:38] days of Jesus when he I would have loved
[1:10:39] to been there, too. Or days of Moses to
[1:10:42] see the Exodus or Noah or, you know, the
[1:10:44] great incredible times of, you know, the
[1:10:47] Bible. But we're living in Bible days.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; The same God is here today. Amen. The
[1:10:52] same one who walked there on the shores
[1:10:55] of Galilee is the very same God that's
[1:10:57] present here right now.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's in you, he's present.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's dwelling in your soul,
[1:11:06] who's who's received a true new birth,
[1:11:09] receive the Holy Ghost, then he's here
[1:11:11] right now.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He's here right now. He's not just in
[1:11:13] heaven. He's here right now. Amen. He's
[1:11:15] here right now. Amen. He's sitting in
[1:11:17] pews. He's standing here. Amen. He's
[1:11:19] He's saying amen. He's preaching the
[1:11:21] word. Amen. He is living through his
[1:11:23] people. Amen. He is manifesting himself.
[1:11:25] You say, "I've never seen God." Look
[1:11:27] around.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've never seen the word made
[1:11:29] flesh. Look around. Amen. And then you
[1:11:31] begin to realize, "Amen. I wasn't saved
[1:11:34] by a religion. I wasn't saved by
[1:11:36] history. I wasn't saved by accepted
[1:11:38] culture. I wasn't saved by a church. No,
[1:11:40] I was saved by almighty God." Amen. That
[1:11:43] that same one who made Sun, Moon, and
[1:11:45] Stars, Amen, found me. And you know, do
[1:11:47] you know the big thing you got to
[1:11:48] realize? What caused you to receive it?
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing that caused the
[1:11:54] woman at the well to receive it. Brother
[1:11:56] Anne began to speak about in the future
[1:11:57] home. He said that the woman at the well
[1:12:00] had representation in heaven. Amen. The
[1:12:03] scribes and Pharisees had no
[1:12:04] representation in heaven which is a
[1:12:06] theophony. So when she saw Messiah, when
[1:12:09] she saw the Messiah living, acting,
[1:12:11] speaking, something in her said that's
[1:12:13] him because she had representation in
[1:12:16] heaven. She didn't work it out with her
[1:12:18] mind. She didn't work it out because of
[1:12:19] culture. She didn't work it out because
[1:12:21] of what she could put together with her
[1:12:22] own thinking. No, it was because she had
[1:12:24] representation in heaven. Amen. It's the
[1:12:27] same thing with you and I, friends. When
[1:12:29] this message becomes more than a voice
[1:12:31] of a man, but you hear that voice behind
[1:12:34] the voice, you hear that anointed word.
[1:12:35] You hear God revealing himself. Amen.
[1:12:38] Through the prophet messenger, what's
[1:12:39] happening? You're hearing from your
[1:12:41] theophony. You are you do that because
[1:12:43] you have representation in heaven.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:48] Praise the Lord. And that representation
[1:12:50] was there. It's an eternal
[1:12:52] representation.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it was there before the devil
[1:12:55] ever was made. Before the devil ever
[1:12:57] fell and became Lucifer, before he ever
[1:12:59] had a scheme in his mind of I'm going to
[1:13:01] destroy the world and I'm going to be
[1:13:02] God over the world and I'm going to take
[1:13:04] the sons of God captive and I'm going to
[1:13:05] be like God. Before that thought ever
[1:13:07] came into his mind and came into
[1:13:09] maturity, you had representation in
[1:13:12] heaven.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why you turn down the
[1:13:14] devil's lie. Amen. in his way. You've
[1:13:16] got representation in heaven.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That should make you shout a
[1:13:20] little bit, shouldn't you? Shouldn't
[1:13:20] you? Yeah. We realize no. Before the
[1:13:22] devil became the devil, there was part
[1:13:24] of me. Amen. That I had representation.
[1:13:27] I had a theophony. Amen. Up in glory.
[1:13:30] Amen. Because that's there. I cannot
[1:13:32] fall. I cannot be lost. Amen. I cannot
[1:13:34] be cast away. Amen. No. Why? Because I
[1:13:37] I'm an attribute of God upon the earth.
[1:13:40] Hallelujah. Are we sufficiently
[1:13:42] impressed by this one? Before there was
[1:13:44] anything thought of you, thought of the
[1:13:46] time you'd be living in, thought of the
[1:13:48] knew the things you'd go through, knew
[1:13:50] the troubles you'd go through, knew the
[1:13:51] world's condition when you were here.
[1:13:53] And he says, "I'm going to prove my word
[1:13:56] by placing them in Lady Oia. I'm going
[1:13:58] to prove my word by putting them in this
[1:14:00] lukewarm country of New Zealand. I'm
[1:14:02] going to prove my word."
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz I'm going to put them here and
[1:14:05] they're not going to be succumbed by the
[1:14:07] enemy. They're not going to be destroyed
[1:14:09] by the spirit. But no, they're going to
[1:14:11] put it under their own feet.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I mean, they're going to walk with me.
[1:14:14] They're going to know me. I mean, I'm
[1:14:16] going to prove my word through their
[1:14:17] lives, and I'm going to reveal myself to
[1:14:19] them. Hallelujah. Are we sufficiently
[1:14:21] impressed?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; You ain't saved by doctrine.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; You ain't saved by human uh human
[1:14:28] influence.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; It's almighty God.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Are we sufficiently impressed?
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; It was him.
[1:14:36] The same one that made all things is the
[1:14:38] same one that's drawing you.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; The one who gave the promise is the one
[1:14:44] here to fulfill every promise.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Has it impacted enough us?
[1:14:51] Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; I wish I could put it in words. I really
[1:14:55] wish I could.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; But has it gripped us? Has it really
[1:14:59] caught our imagination? Caught our
[1:15:01] attention? God more than religion. This
[1:15:04] ain't about Shikina Tabernacle or any
[1:15:06] other kind of church. No, it's more than
[1:15:08] that. It's God bringing his word to you.
[1:15:11] I mean, the same God where people have
[1:15:12] been looking and debating about the lamb
[1:15:14] taking the book and when's it going to
[1:15:16] happen and what the seals are and all
[1:15:17] these things to wind up his plan of
[1:15:19] redemption, that same one took that
[1:15:22] book, gave the revelation of it to the
[1:15:24] prophet. We become one with that
[1:15:25] revelation and now we're speaking its
[1:15:27] contents.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we know where we are in the
[1:15:31] plan of redemption. Has that impressed
[1:15:33] us enough that we've been redeemed by
[1:15:36] the blood of Jesus Christ and this
[1:15:37] message has come to claim you?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I know I'm throwing out some statements,
[1:15:42] but I just want you to think about has
[1:15:43] this thing, wow, I have eternal life.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Has that impressed you enough? Has it
[1:15:48] sufficiently impacted you? I am actually
[1:15:51] I cannot be lost.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:57] Amen. Has it also sufficiently impressed
[1:16:01] us that it doesn't matter what the enemy
[1:16:03] does, he is a defeated being. And our
[1:16:07] God is a mighty conqueror. And there's
[1:16:09] nothing that is too deep, too long,
[1:16:13] seems to be too much of someone that God
[1:16:15] cannot undo.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no unbelief that God can't
[1:16:20] un undo.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; There's no complex. There's no hurt.
[1:16:24] There's no trauma. There's nothing that
[1:16:27] it could be generations of of of trauma
[1:16:29] and abuse, but God can undo it all in a
[1:16:32] moment.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Are we sufficiently impressed? Because
[1:16:35] he made the human spirit. He made our
[1:16:38] bodies. Amen. He made every part of the
[1:16:40] facet of our being. He knows he know see
[1:16:42] the m you like brother said about you
[1:16:44] know there was a man and he was a
[1:16:45] mechanic and he was trying to fix a car
[1:16:47] and he you know took it apart and he
[1:16:49] just tried to put it back together. He
[1:16:50] just could not get the thing going. He
[1:16:52] spent days and he's getting frustrated
[1:16:54] and you know but then one day a man in a
[1:16:56] suit walks into his uh automotive shop
[1:16:59] and there he is. He's you this
[1:17:02] mechanic's all frustrated under the car
[1:17:03] trying to tinker with things and he just
[1:17:05] hears a voice. What's wrong with the
[1:17:07] car?
[1:17:08] And you know the mechanic's no doubt all
[1:17:10] frustrated. Well, if I knew that maybe
[1:17:11] he thought if I knew that I wouldn't be
[1:17:13] here right now but you know he tries to
[1:17:15] explain the problem and you know all
[1:17:17] these things. And then this guy in the
[1:17:18] suit says, "Um, replace that valve, the
[1:17:23] spark plug. This needs changing. I'm not
[1:17:25] a car guy, so I can't just make stuff
[1:17:27] up, but just basically fix this and this
[1:17:29] and this." And the mechanic's like,
[1:17:31] "That's weird, but okay, I'll do it." He
[1:17:34] does it. He puts the key in the
[1:17:35] ignition. The thing just purr like a
[1:17:37] kitten, revs away. And then the mechanic
[1:17:40] looks at this guy and says, "How did you
[1:17:42] know what is wrong with this car?" He
[1:17:45] says, "Well, I designed it. Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; cuz I made the car.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how I know how to fix it.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; We've been made by God.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; He's the master mechanic. Amen. He knows
[1:18:00] every part of our being. Amen. He can
[1:18:02] fix us because he made us.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We don't have to go
[1:18:06] through years of psychology trying to
[1:18:08] work out who we are and our problems.
[1:18:09] Just come into his presence one time.
[1:18:12] Amen. Let him reveal yourself to you.
[1:18:14] Amen. And you will begin to see actually
[1:18:16] this is who I really am.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. The chief
[1:18:20] mechanics here.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I can't he can't fix this. He He
[1:18:25] made the universe, man.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Let's just put this in perspective. He
[1:18:29] made this planet by his spoken word. The
[1:18:32] body that you're made out of is his
[1:18:34] spoken word. The materials, the atoms,
[1:18:36] the, you know, all those things.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; So, if he made that, he just said, "Let
[1:18:40] there be." Boom.
[1:18:43] Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, but medically it's impossible. They
[1:18:49] go by what they see.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; We appreciate them. We go by what God
[1:18:54] sees.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord that heals all thy
[1:18:56] diseases.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm a present help in time of
[1:18:58] trouble. By your by my stripes, you're
[1:19:00] healed.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; I just said that in first person, but
[1:19:04] the Lord says by his strip, you know, by
[1:19:05] his stripes, we're healed, right? Amen.
[1:19:07] That's how he sees it. That's what we
[1:19:08] should be looking to. But then also we
[1:19:10] sufficiently impressed if that same one
[1:19:12] is now in us. Are we sufficiently
[1:19:14] impressed with the power that lays
[1:19:16] within the believer or the authority
[1:19:18] that lays in the believer? Are we are we
[1:19:20] sufficiently impressed by that?
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; You know, because if we realize, no, I
[1:19:25] am a son of God. I'm made as a as
[1:19:28] brother Bram says a messiah,
[1:19:31] right? We are messiahs upon the earth.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; We're not saviors, but the same savior
[1:19:36] is now within us. We're anointed with
[1:19:38] the same spirit. Right? You see a church
[1:19:41] that's fully surrendered to the Lord
[1:19:42] according to his word. I think brother
[1:19:44] says, "I'll show you a Messiah
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; upon the earth. I'll show you an
[1:19:48] anointed people."
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if that same anointing is
[1:19:51] within us, do we realize the authority
[1:19:53] that we have?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Do we?
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like a little bitty
[1:19:57] policeman. Brother Bram says, little
[1:19:58] bitty guy hat half over his ears. He can
[1:20:00] barely stand in the uniform. It's just
[1:20:02] too big. You know, that guy would be a
[1:20:04] pushover. Nothing. He could stop
[1:20:06] nothing. But he's got an authority
[1:20:08] behind him. that when he goes out on the
[1:20:10] street, it doesn't matter how big that
[1:20:12] truck is coming his way. He can blow his
[1:20:14] whistle in order to stop and that
[1:20:15] thing's got to stop because he's got
[1:20:17] authority in the uniform that he's
[1:20:19] wearing.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's got a badge of a policeman.
[1:20:22] He's got the full the full power of that
[1:20:25] police force is behind him, right? And
[1:20:28] then if it gets too heavy, they'll call
[1:20:30] in the military.
[1:20:32] Amen. We have a badge of a believer.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother says, "We don't have
[1:20:36] any power, but we got good authority."
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Right? That we But you have you have to
[1:20:41] use that badge yourself. You've got to
[1:20:43] use your God-given authority. Amen. To
[1:20:45] push the enemy back.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says, "Man is omnipotent."
[1:20:50] That means all powerful. You don't
[1:20:51] believe that he is. A man fully
[1:20:52] surrendered to God is omnipotent. Who's
[1:20:54] fully surrendered to God today? I mean,
[1:20:56] did he not say in Mark 11:22,
[1:20:58] "Whatsoever things you say and don't
[1:21:00] doubt in your heart, it will come to
[1:21:02] pass. You can have what you've said."
[1:21:04] What happens when two omnipotents meet?
[1:21:06] When God and man comes together, two
[1:21:07] omnipotents, something's got to shake. I
[1:21:10] mean, whatever you'd you'd say with that
[1:21:12] creative power of the omnipotence of
[1:21:14] God, knowing that he's promised it. And
[1:21:16] he said it in his word, it creates a
[1:21:18] power that goes out yonder and brings
[1:21:20] things to pass, things that is not, and
[1:21:22] makes them as though they are because
[1:21:24] two omnipotents have met. There he
[1:21:26] stands. Isn't he wonderful?
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when two So that's why I say
[1:21:31] you've got to take your opportunity. I
[1:21:34] mean because you're omnipotent, he's
[1:21:36] omnipotent. When they come together,
[1:21:37] something's got to shake. And when you
[1:21:39] realize the logos of God, God himself is
[1:21:42] speaking and he releases his creative
[1:21:44] word. You take them into your heart.
[1:21:45] Say, "Yes, amen. Lord, you're more than
[1:21:47] able to do it." Amen. Respond with an
[1:21:48] amen. Amen. What's happening then? Then
[1:21:50] what happens? Something's got to shake.
[1:21:52] Something's got to move. Amen. Because I
[1:21:54] think we've been too long trying to move
[1:21:56] things with psychology and nice ideas
[1:21:58] and power of positive thinking. Why
[1:22:00] don't we let God move things? How he
[1:22:02] ordained things should move. Amen. By
[1:22:04] the power of his word by having faith in
[1:22:06] his word. Because even Jesus was asked,
[1:22:08] how do we do the works of God? And Jesus
[1:22:11] said, believe on him who he has sent.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; That's how you do the works of God. Oh,
[1:22:15] I want to do the works of a Christian.
[1:22:17] Believe on him who he has sent.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll find the works of God
[1:22:21] will follow. I believe this word.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I believe God sent this word to this
[1:22:26] generation. I mean, I believe this
[1:22:28] message is for this end time. I believe
[1:22:31] it does make the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:33] I believe it reveals Jesus Christ in the
[1:22:35] scripture.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; And something's got to shake.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to sit there and
[1:22:41] wrestle with things and how we're going
[1:22:42] to work things out. No. Bring
[1:22:44] omnipotence on the scene.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Bring him on the scene and see what
[1:22:48] happens.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't know if that
[1:22:50] could ever happen." Just get a
[1:22:52] breakthrough in prayer.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You know, you know when that peace
[1:22:55] comes, who who's ever prayed for
[1:22:57] something and just a peace comes
[1:22:58] settles.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; What's that? Now something's shaking.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Something's going to shake now. Why? Cuz
[1:23:04] God has given you an answer. You don't
[1:23:06] see it. You don't maybe not hear it, but
[1:23:08] God's given you a piece. I've got this.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's calling omnipotence on the
[1:23:12] scene. Amen. And then God begins to take
[1:23:14] that now and make it material.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've seen that so many times.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our God is more than able.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not back in 2020 20, you
[1:23:24] know, 2012 or wherever when he, you
[1:23:25] know, he's the same God today.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what happens when we let
[1:23:29] ourselves go and let God have his way.
[1:23:31] And that's when we say we're no longer
[1:23:32] afraid of how we'll act. We may not act
[1:23:34] nothing but just let God take complete
[1:23:36] control.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] Hallelujah. He says, "My word," our Lord
[1:23:47] Jesus says, "so so my word uh that goeth
[1:23:49] forth um out of my mouth, it shall not
[1:23:51] return unto me void. It shall accomplish
[1:23:53] that which I please, and it shall
[1:23:54] prosper in the thing whereto I sent it."
[1:23:57] Amen. So God sent his word. It's going
[1:24:00] to produce what he says it will produce.
[1:24:03] Amen. When our Lord Jesus, you know, he
[1:24:05] would he would there stand there in the
[1:24:07] um synagogue. He'd read from Isaiah how
[1:24:09] the spirit of the law is upon me to bind
[1:24:11] out the brokenhearted sit at liberty
[1:24:12] them that are bruised release the
[1:24:13] captives and all these things. And what
[1:24:15] did he say this day is the scripture
[1:24:17] fulfilled in your ears. Amen. And so so
[1:24:20] what was happening is he said he's
[1:24:22] saying this is the word that I sent and
[1:24:25] here I am to fulfill it. Take your
[1:24:27] opportunity. They didn't take their
[1:24:30] opportunity. They said, "But Joseph's
[1:24:31] his father, Mary's his mother, he lives
[1:24:33] here, and they were offended at this guy
[1:24:35] who was a little kid in their village,
[1:24:37] was a teenager, a young person, now he's
[1:24:39] 30. Now he's declaring he's the
[1:24:40] Messiah."
[1:24:42] But he was. They didn't have within them
[1:24:45] what they needed to recognize him.
[1:24:50] But we do, I believe, by God's grace. I
[1:24:52] know I'm kind of going around in a
[1:24:54] cycle, but I want to keep going around
[1:24:55] the cycle. Okay?
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. His word will produce what he says
[1:25:00] it will produce.
[1:25:04] Now, brother Ram says this, "And what
[1:25:05] was the Holy Ghost given for?" That's
[1:25:07] the purpose of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:25:09] father again, God the Father dwelling in
[1:25:11] you, working out his plans to finish his
[1:25:14] plan of redemption, working through you,
[1:25:16] making you a co-worker with him, giving
[1:25:18] you a place. I like that. Giving you a
[1:25:21] part for your fallen, lost brother and
[1:25:23] sister, giving you his spirit and his
[1:25:25] love to go hunt the lost as he did in
[1:25:27] the Garden of Eden. Adam, Adam, where
[1:25:29] art thou? That's what the Holy Spirit
[1:25:31] does to a man or a woman when it strikes
[1:25:33] into their heart and it takes its abode.
[1:25:35] There's a thirst and a hungering for
[1:25:37] lost souls. That's what's the matter
[1:25:39] with the meeting today. There's not
[1:25:40] enough spirit touch in it. Amen. To go
[1:25:42] to the souls of the lost and the dying.
[1:25:46] We must never let the spirit of God
[1:25:48] leave our church.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Every service must have a spirit touch
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; where God comes and anoints his word to
[1:25:55] our lives. It may be very dynamic. It
[1:25:58] may not be. That's irrelevant,
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; right? But it's got to have a spirit
[1:26:02] touch in it that motivates us now. Lord,
[1:26:05] my fallen brethren,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; my family, Lord,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; my neighbor, Lord, someone on the
[1:26:10] street, Lord, that we want, we have a
[1:26:13] hunger for the lost and dying souls.
[1:26:15] It's more than to take a name or a
[1:26:17] church or a building or denomination
[1:26:18] instead of a soul-winning program. How
[1:26:20] pitiful. We could stay on it much. God
[1:26:23] poured himself into Christ. Correct. God
[1:26:26] poured himself into the church.
[1:26:27] Therefore, now watch. At that day you
[1:26:29] shall know that I am in the Father and
[1:26:31] you are in me and I in you at that day
[1:26:32] and you'll know it. For it's the whole
[1:26:34] thing is one plan of redemption coming
[1:26:36] down that God coming back to live and
[1:26:38] dwell with and commune with his to his
[1:26:41] people as he did at the beginning. Now
[1:26:43] then as soon as he gets his church in
[1:26:44] speaking conditions, gets his church to
[1:26:46] a place we can flow himself through and
[1:26:49] love and persuade and fellowship, then
[1:26:51] there will come an Eden. He'll take his
[1:26:53] church back to where it left him uh back
[1:26:56] to a to an Eden again. That's where it
[1:26:59] fell. Uh that's where uh it made its
[1:27:02] first start or fall. That's where it'll
[1:27:04] be taken right back to with every clean
[1:27:06] slate um slate of redemption, bringing
[1:27:08] them back uh straight back to that place
[1:27:11] again.
[1:27:13] Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; So God's given you a place in his plan
[1:27:16] of redemption.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God works through man. He
[1:27:20] could have had the stars preach, the
[1:27:21] wind, nature preach the gospel, but he's
[1:27:24] chosen you. Amen. To be a part of his
[1:27:28] plan of redemption.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this is important
[1:27:34] because we got to realize we have a job
[1:27:36] to do. Amen. You've got a part of this.
[1:27:40] This is not us being passive. No, this
[1:27:42] is us being active in the kingdom of
[1:27:43] God, allowing him to live through our
[1:27:46] lives. I mean allowing him to to to
[1:27:49] prove his word because we want everyone
[1:27:52] to have an opportunity in his presence.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen, don't we? And it's more than just
[1:27:57] within these four walls. So this is a
[1:27:59] good place to start, right? But we, you
[1:28:01] know, because of the Holy Ghost when it
[1:28:03] comes into our life, it creates an
[1:28:04] atmosphere because why? The Messiah has
[1:28:07] put on flesh again. Christ has put on
[1:28:09] flesh again that now people can have an
[1:28:12] opportunity, amen, to get what they have
[1:28:14] need of.
[1:28:16] Amen.
[1:28:18] I'm just going to finish with this
[1:28:19] because time is gone.
[1:28:23] I've been thinking about this a lot
[1:28:25] recently.
[1:28:27] There were four friends.
[1:28:30] They had a crippled friend. He couldn't
[1:28:33] walk.
[1:28:34] But these four friends recognized that
[1:28:37] Jesus was in the house. They recognized
[1:28:40] the Messiah was on earth. Amen. And they
[1:28:43] believed if they could just get their
[1:28:45] friend into the presence of God, then
[1:28:48] God would do the rest. Because they just
[1:28:50] knew if I can just get him to talk to
[1:28:53] them. I mean, him to talk to our friend,
[1:28:56] right? Just get him get him into his
[1:28:59] presence, then now the Messiah can do
[1:29:01] what the Messiah does. Amen. He's
[1:29:03] Jehovah of miracles, right? He's a
[1:29:05] supernatural God. Amen. There's nothing
[1:29:07] he cannot do. Amen. And brother Bram
[1:29:09] says it's like when you come into his
[1:29:11] presence, the supernatural is happening.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, so they had a burden
[1:29:16] on their heart. We've got to get our
[1:29:18] friend to where he is.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Now, they were not afraid to be
[1:29:23] unconventional
[1:29:24] to get their friend into his presence.
[1:29:26] They would have tried the front door.
[1:29:28] They couldn't get near the front door
[1:29:29] because of the press of the people. But
[1:29:31] their faith would not take no for an
[1:29:33] answer. Amen. They had a revelation
[1:29:36] anchored in their heart. Messiah is upon
[1:29:38] the earth. Amen. We must get him there
[1:29:40] and you know he couldn't walk. So they
[1:29:42] pick him up. They go towards the house.
[1:29:44] There's too many people. But their faith
[1:29:46] did not take that as an option. I mean
[1:29:48] their faith said he must get at his
[1:29:50] feet. I mean so they take him up on the
[1:29:52] roof. They didn't ask permission to get
[1:29:54] rid of those tiles. They begin to put a
[1:29:56] skylight into that guy's house.
[1:29:58] Hallelujah. Why? Because that roof was
[1:30:01] an obstacle that they weren't willing to
[1:30:03] stop at. Amen. No, their faith was going
[1:30:05] to go through the roof. and low their
[1:30:08] friend. Amen. It's the same thing with
[1:30:09] you and I. There's a lot of roofs over a
[1:30:11] lot of people. Amen. There's skepticism.
[1:30:14] There's unbelief. There's complexes.
[1:30:16] There's anxiety. There's doubts. There's
[1:30:18] trouble past. There's problems. Those
[1:30:20] are a lot of roofs, right? But we have
[1:30:22] faith to take down the roof. Amen. To
[1:30:25] create an atmosphere. Amen. That we are
[1:30:27] determined. Lord, if you just speak to
[1:30:30] them, Amen. Lord, if you just start
[1:30:32] speaking to them, then you will begin to
[1:30:34] do what only you can do. Amen. That's
[1:30:37] why it's so important when you come to
[1:30:38] the house of God, praise him.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Give him glory. Amen. Doesn't matter
[1:30:42] what you're going through. We're not
[1:30:44] here to worship our problems. We're not
[1:30:46] here to worship what we're going to face
[1:30:47] tomorrow. No, we're here to worship the
[1:30:49] true and living God. Amen. Because God
[1:30:52] inhabits the praises of his people.
[1:30:54] Amen. You begin to praise God. You may
[1:30:56] not be loud. It doesn't matter. It's
[1:30:57] what's in your heart. Let it come out. I
[1:30:59] mean, as long as he's moving, think of
[1:31:01] the goodness of God. Don't get caught up
[1:31:03] in your troubles. We all have troubles.
[1:31:05] Don't let that be your main thing.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Let him be your main thing.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happens? You begin
[1:31:10] to create an atmosphere and God comes
[1:31:12] down. He inhabits that praise. Amen.
[1:31:15] Because he loves to inhabit the praises
[1:31:17] of his people. Amen. Then then God
[1:31:19] begins to move in the service. And then
[1:31:20] you begin to your faith begins to pull
[1:31:22] on whatever gift is standing in front of
[1:31:24] you. God, speak to me, Lord. Speak to my
[1:31:27] daughter. Speak to my son. Speak to that
[1:31:29] brother. Speak to them. And you're not
[1:31:31] in a condescending way, but you know,
[1:31:34] you know what he can do.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he begins to talk to
[1:31:37] someone. And then what does that do? You
[1:31:39] create an atmosphere of love. You begin
[1:31:41] to express yourself to God. And God
[1:31:43] steps into that praise. More than angels
[1:31:45] gathering around. God himself steps in.
[1:31:47] Hallelujah. What's happening? Tiles are
[1:31:50] flying.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Tiles are flying off roofs. Amen. And
[1:31:54] then you get that person down to the
[1:31:55] prince of God and their mind is maybe
[1:31:58] wandering all the way around to
[1:31:59] tomorrow, the next week. Then they start
[1:32:01] to focus in. What's happened? Messiah
[1:32:03] now begins to speak. Begins to speak to
[1:32:06] their need and their trouble and their
[1:32:08] situation. And the whoever is preaching
[1:32:11] has no idea what they're going through
[1:32:12] because that doesn't matter. But God
[1:32:13] knows all about it. And then he begins
[1:32:15] to speak to them. And then they begin to
[1:32:17] be dealt with by God. And what do they
[1:32:19] do? What's the first thing God says? Thy
[1:32:21] sins be forgiven thee. Don't let that
[1:32:23] thing hold you down anymore. I mean,
[1:32:24] don't let that anxiety, that weight be
[1:32:26] your trouble. No, I'm here to alleviate
[1:32:28] that thing. Amen. Then what do you do?
[1:32:29] Instead of being carried in that bed of
[1:32:31] affliction and this is my problem, this
[1:32:33] is what I'm going through. Amen. You
[1:32:35] carry that thing out of the building.
[1:32:37] Hallelujah. You don't need to worry
[1:32:39] about what's going on. No, you're
[1:32:40] carrying that thing as a trophy.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; I was on this bed. This anxiety ruled
[1:32:45] me. This fear gripped me and it crippled
[1:32:46] me. I couldn't walk as I should. And I
[1:32:48] was so worried and anxious. But then he
[1:32:50] spoke to me.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; He spoke to me. Amen. And said, "You're
[1:32:53] fine. My blood's covered you. It's
[1:32:55] everything's taken out. Everything's
[1:32:56] under control. Now take that thing and
[1:32:59] carry it
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; and be a living witness. Amen. That the
[1:33:02] Lord took me off this the other day.
[1:33:05] Hallelujah. And then people begin to see
[1:33:08] that. They say, "What happened to you?"
[1:33:10] Let me tell you. You won't believe it,
[1:33:12] but I believe it because it happened. I
[1:33:15] was once lost. I was in the world. I was
[1:33:18] crippled up with fear, anxiety,
[1:33:20] problems. I thought I could never be
[1:33:21] right with God. I thought I'd gone too
[1:33:23] far. But then my friends,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, they look beyond. We're
[1:33:28] friends, aren't we?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do we love to see when
[1:33:31] everyone comes into church? Praise God.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; My friends are here. Amen. Believers are
[1:33:35] here. Something's going to happen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Messiah's going to come into the
[1:33:39] house. Amen. Touch somebody.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. But then my
[1:33:46] friends got me into his presence. Then
[1:33:48] he began to speak to me
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; and I knew he knew things.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; He knew things no one else knew.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; But he told me one thing. Thy sins be
[1:33:58] forgiven thee. Take up this bed and
[1:34:01] walk.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; This is what church is about.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is because remember it says
[1:34:08] this is why I put it in yellow. When
[1:34:10] Jesus saw their faith,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; it didn't say it nothing to do with the
[1:34:14] crippled man's faith. People think, "Oh,
[1:34:17] but they don't believe and they're not
[1:34:18] even interested in God." Get them into
[1:34:20] the presence of God.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Your faith will cause them to have a
[1:34:24] one-on-one interview with the Messiah.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; When he saw their faith, when Jesus saw
[1:34:29] their faith,
[1:34:32] that same faith is in you.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; That same faith, cuz there's something
[1:34:37] in us, Lord, if I can just get that
[1:34:39] person in your presence. If I can just
[1:34:40] Lord just get rid of those tiles, get
[1:34:42] them into where you are, then you can
[1:34:45] deal with them.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Who believes that
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; that same faith is in you.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; So why not put in some skylights?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you Oh, there's a lot of
[1:34:59] obstacles. It doesn't matter how many
[1:35:01] obstacles there are. Faith does not take
[1:35:03] no for an answer.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is not satisfied with a
[1:35:07] problem and staying there. No. faith
[1:35:08] bulldozes through sir
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; because they had a revelation all we
[1:35:12] need to do is get him there
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; and everything will take care of itself
[1:35:15] because he will begin to work
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:35:20] amen we have the musicians please this
[1:35:22] morning
[1:35:25] I want to leave it there this morning
[1:35:26] now God has moved this morning
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; he's been moving he's been speaking he's
[1:35:33] been anointing this is an opportunity
[1:35:38] Amen. You can receive it in your seat.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; You can come get prayer. You're very
[1:35:43] welcome. But you can receive it in your
[1:35:45] seat as we're singing, as we're
[1:35:46] worshiping God.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is not limited to here or
[1:35:50] the back or wherever. But why not why
[1:35:53] not open your heart and say, "Lord, fill
[1:35:57] me once again.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Refill me with your presence, Lord.
[1:36:00] Lord, all I want is you. All I want is
[1:36:03] your presence, oh God. All I want is to
[1:36:05] see you live that I can return it back
[1:36:07] with praise. Amen. That's Lord. That's
[1:36:10] the only reason I want to see you prove
[1:36:11] your word is so I can praise you. Amen.
[1:36:13] For who you are and what you've done and
[1:36:15] what you're doing.
[1:36:18] Amen. You say, "Well, I can't pull off
[1:36:20] the roof. I know I've got a lot of
[1:36:21] crippled people that I can't get the
[1:36:22] roof off." Let faith grip. Let faith get
[1:36:26] a hold. And you'll see those things
[1:36:27] begin to move.

[1:49:48] Lord Jesus. Lord, to recognize Messiah.
[1:49:51] Recognize you're the same yesterday,

[1:54:22] As you would, Lord, in your great grace
[1:54:24] and I believe a great blessing upon us,
[1:54:26] you would bring the Inquano family,
[1:54:28] Lord, from South Africa here to
[1:54:30] Wellington. Father, it's been such a
[1:54:32] blessing to have them, Lord, to watch
[1:54:33] them grow, Lord Jesus. Not just uh
[1:54:36] naturally of the children growing up,
[1:54:37] but spiritually, Lord Jesus, to see you
[1:54:40] express yourself through all of their
[1:54:41] lives. We want to thank you for this, my
[1:54:43] God. And now, Lord Jesus, there's a
[1:54:45] change of season. They have the Lord,
[1:54:47] they're going to Perth, and we're very
[1:54:49] sad naturally in our hearts to see them
[1:54:50] go because we love them. But Lord, we
[1:54:52] know that our footsteps are ordered of
[1:54:54] you, Lord Jesus. So, Father, I pray you
[1:54:56] continue to guide their steps. Lord, I
[1:54:58] ask Lord Jesus that just naturally
[1:55:00] everything would would would slot into
[1:55:01] place. Lord, the moving, the immigration
[1:55:03] and Lord, everything, Father, finding a
[1:55:05] house, Lord Jesus, all these things just
[1:55:07] just may be such a smooth, easy
[1:55:09] transition. But Lord, more so
[1:55:11] spiritually, Lord God, I pray that Lord,
[1:55:13] they would go from strength to strength,
[1:55:15] Lord, and you. May you continue to pour
[1:55:17] yourself in, continue to mature them,
[1:55:20] continue to flow through their life,
[1:55:22] Lord, no matter where they go, Lord God.
[1:55:24] May people truly say those are real
[1:55:26] Christians.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, they really know you, Lord. That's
[1:55:29] what we want, Lord Jesus. May you bless
[1:55:31] them and keep them, Father. Lord, we
[1:55:33] love you so much and thank you for these
[1:55:34] years we've had together. We cherish
[1:55:36] them and we're so glad that there will
[1:55:38] truly come a day, Lord, when the Lord,
[1:55:40] we'll be reunited together. Father, we
[1:55:42] looking forward to that moment where you
[1:55:43] take us all home. But in the meantime,
[1:55:45] Lord, may they just continue to fight
[1:55:47] this good fight of faith. Bless them
[1:55:49] abundantly, Father, in all things they
[1:55:50] do. And may they see a book of Acts
[1:55:52] written. May they see souls come to your
[1:55:54] kingdom, Lord. Father, as a result of
[1:55:56] this move, grant it, Father. We commit
[1:55:57] them into your hands. We commit Sister
[1:55:59] Sep who's going first, Lord. Help her,
[1:56:01] Lord, as she transitions the new job and
[1:56:03] everything. Lord, we commit her into
[1:56:04] your hands and the families left behind
[1:56:06] as well. Be with them, Lord, in Jesus
[1:56:08] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God richly bless you. God bless
