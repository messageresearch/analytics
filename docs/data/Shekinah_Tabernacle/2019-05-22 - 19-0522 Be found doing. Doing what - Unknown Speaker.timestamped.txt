[2:46] yes okay we are here tonight to worship
[3:07] the Lord you know we have an opportunity
[3:21] to just do this and to be filled with
[3:36] the Holy Ghost to be to be refreshed to
[3:38] be revived to be encouraged whatever we
[3:40] might need in our life from the Lord we
[3:42] can have it this evening and it all
[3:44] depends on our approach if we just come
[3:47] casual don't really hear too much then
[3:50] that we won't get much in return but the
[3:54] Bible says seek and you shall find ask
[3:56] and it shall be given not going to shall
[3:58] be open and that's the we come to the
[4:00] God there are answers it hears that
[4:03] response when we when we enter in and we
[4:05] desire know the lords of gentlemen he
[4:07] doesn't he actually is quite timid he
[4:09] doesn't push in and he doesn't push it
[4:12] into a situation he waits to be kind of
[4:15] welcomed into a situation he wants to be
[4:17] constrained like the the disciples that

[36:23] well feel glory in Jesus Christ's name
[36:24] thought I Lord we ask these things amen
[36:28] they may God bless your friends you may
[36:29] have your seats tonight and yes I want
[36:32] to
[36:32] I heard quite a few months ago heard by
[36:36] the Aaron McGarry preached a a youth
[36:38] camp and he went into the development of
[36:43] the brain and this is probably kind of
[36:47] bit strange but you know we don't
[36:50] understand ourselves growing up our own
[36:53] bodies are a mystery we go through great
[36:56] changes of life and you know we don't
[36:58] understand yeah we go but crazy it seems
[37:00] but there's a reason for it
[37:02] and because but your thing is if we can
[37:07] understand what's going on in us because
[37:09] we're born into chaos this world is
[37:11] chaotic human life is chaotic you know
[37:14] but we're not meant to stay in chaos
[37:16] yeah we're not meant to just flow with
[37:18] the tide and the devil does what he
[37:20] wants we're not called to be that way so
[37:22] the Lord your the wonderful thing about
[37:24] the word is that brings clarity and so
[37:28] as I as I posed the question just from
[37:30] that verse you know Lester does that
[37:31] servant whom his Lord when he cometh
[37:33] shall find so doing and I asked the
[37:36] question while doing what you know
[37:37] because everyone is is busy doing
[37:39] something but what are we doing you know
[37:42] and it's very easy to say well we're
[37:44] following the Lord we're raising our
[37:46] families and it can sound a bit vague in
[37:48] a bit kind of broad but we want to go
[37:51] more than just broad you know we want to
[37:54] come down to really where the rubber
[37:55] hits the road and we want to really say
[37:57] well what does it mean to be raised as a
[38:01] Christian what does it mean to raise
[38:02] children in the message you know what
[38:05] does that mean because it sounds very
[38:06] easy to say while I'm raising my
[38:08] children they're going to serve the Lord
[38:09] and raise up a child in the way it shall
[38:11] go and when it's older shall not depart
[38:13] and that is true but the thing is if you
[38:16] you know and I'll come to it later but
[38:18] this whole society is engineered to
[38:20] break relationships the first world is
[38:24] made to break relationships and we're
[38:28] not in the midst of it happening it's
[38:30] happened you know we are you know it's
[38:33] not all the world yars listening to
[38:34] brother Aaron preached the world is
[38:36] falling apart and I could say the world
[38:38] has fallen apart you know we're not
[38:40] living in a day like in his day where
[38:42] the world was an order to a degree then
[38:44] it fell apart we're living in the time
[38:46] which is broken so it sees in Ephesians
[38:49] if you want to turn with me to Ephesians
[38:50] chapter 4 and we're gonna read from from
[38:53] from verse 6 I'm just going to just just
[38:57] follow me this is this is for everyone I
[38:59] believe because not just children
[39:01] turning into adults is a great change
[39:03] it's when adults had about 40 and
[39:06] there's a big change in life as well and
[39:08] you know there's challenges that come
[39:09] you know there's always we're gonna be
[39:11] happy when these bodies are changed
[39:13] we're gonna be relieved
[39:15] praise the Lord owner to put up with
[39:17] that guy one more day
[39:18] we have overcoming power but we have to
[39:20] overcome
[39:21] so Ephesians 4 and verse 6 it says here
[39:24] one God and Father of all who is above
[39:26] all and through all in a new all but
[39:29] unto every one of us is given grace
[39:30] according to the measure of the gift of
[39:32] Christ wherefore he saith when he
[39:34] ascended up on high he led captivity
[39:36] captive and gave gifts unto men now now
[39:40] that he ascended what is it but he also
[39:43] descended first into the lower parts of
[39:45] the earth he that has seen it as the
[39:47] same also that ascended up far above all
[39:50] heavens that he might fill all things
[39:51] and he gave some apostles and some
[39:54] prophets and some evangelists some
[39:56] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[39:58] of the Saints for the work of the
[40:00] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[40:02] Christ now we know that word perfecting
[40:04] is a maturing it's a completion it
[40:06] doesn't mean perfection
[40:07] a sinless profession because the blood
[40:09] of Jesus Christ prefix us but speaks
[40:11] about a maturity coming to a completion
[40:13] it's something that is growing I mean
[40:16] till we all come to the unity of the
[40:17] faith in the end of the knowledge of the
[40:19] Son of God and to a perfect man and to
[40:22] the measure of the stature of the
[40:24] fullness of Christ that we henceforth be
[40:27] no more children so we're going to
[40:29] spiritually go from being children to
[40:31] adults right tossed to and fro and
[40:34] carried about with every wind of
[40:35] doctrine by the sleight of men and
[40:37] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[40:41] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[40:43] and love may grow up into him in all
[40:46] things which is the head even Christ for
[40:49] whom the whole body fitly joined
[40:50] together and compacted by that which
[40:53] every joint supplieth according to the
[40:55] effectual working in the measure of
[40:57] every part maketh increase of the body
[40:59] unto the edifying of itself and love
[41:01] this I say therefore and testify in the
[41:04] Lord that he hits forth walk not as
[41:07] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[41:09] their mind so we're not called the war
[41:12] for coin to our mind okay the vanity of
[41:15] our mouth a vain thing is empty it has
[41:16] no substance there's nothing real to it
[41:18] it's just just you know something that's
[41:20] not real but the word is real right so
[41:23] we're called to walk not as other
[41:24] Gentiles not as other people because
[41:27] they walk according to the vanity of
[41:29] their mind this world is full of vanity
[41:30] vain things that are empty men have
[41:33] these break great pursuits they try and
[41:35] become these great big things but when
[41:37] you come down to the bottom of it
[41:38] there's nothing to it right it's just
[41:40] like you know this world and and you
[41:43] know I'll just say it now this world
[41:46] that we perceive on the internet is not
[41:48] a real world it is through a filter it's
[41:51] through Photoshop there's things called
[41:54] deep fakes where people take faces of
[41:56] people and put it on others and videos
[41:58] trying to make people be doing things
[42:01] that they're not who's aware of those
[42:02] things yes it's not just Photoshop with
[42:04] photos but now it's video and they can
[42:07] make people say things and do things
[42:08] that they never did but it can look so
[42:11] real what's happening it's it's the
[42:13] world as putting a fake reality in front
[42:15] of us and that fake reality is never
[42:18] like reality
[42:19] so therefore the thing that you behold
[42:21] you want to
[42:21] come but you can't become it so what
[42:23] happens people become depressed because
[42:25] they can never obtain what they see Alou
[42:29] you I mean but with the Lord it's not
[42:31] that way it's the opposite I mean
[42:33] because what God calls great man calls
[42:35] foolish what man calls foolish God calls
[42:37] great amen so we want to we don't want
[42:40] to live in a false reality we want to
[42:44] live in reality in the Word of God amen
[42:48] that's why we have to have a sane
[42:51] sensible walk built on faith
[42:54] Amen we are not going to go on a rapture
[42:56] and a great feeling of euphoria it's
[42:59] faith and faith is a revelation and what
[43:03] that means is it's not a hope so it's
[43:05] like I find you that awaited me in my
[43:09] house was a know a billion trillion
[43:11] dollars and it was told me that it was
[43:13] going to be there I wouldn't hope I knew
[43:15] it was there right even though I haven't
[43:18] seen it but I know it's there and
[43:19] faithless things been revealed to you
[43:21] like if you if the Lord told you that
[43:23] you're healed you don't need to worry
[43:25] anymore you know it's going to happen
[43:26] right you're not striving maybe one day
[43:28] and I've got to work out how it's going
[43:29] to happen you know it's going to happen
[43:31] and you're resting in there it's faith I
[43:33] mean just like if you're if it's
[43:35] revealed to you your children are yours
[43:37] they're going in the rapture you can
[43:38] just rejoice a thank you Lord because
[43:40] you're not hoping Lord save them you
[43:42] know they're saved even though you may
[43:44] not ever may not at that current time
[43:46] see it manifested you have a rest
[43:48] knowing that they will come to salvation
[43:50] and you can be strong and confident
[43:52] saying thank you Lord it is going to
[43:53] happen I mean just like Abraham he knew
[43:55] Isaac was coming he wasn't hoping he
[43:58] knew why it was faith amen
[44:02] no having the understanding darkened
[44:05] being alienated
[44:07] a lien ated from the life of God through
[44:10] the ignorance that is in them because of
[44:13] the blindness of their heart who being
[44:17] who being past feeling having given
[44:20] themselves over unto lasciviousness to
[44:23] work all uncleanness with greediness
[44:25] greediness now we read there that a
[44:29] child that we're to grow from a child to
[44:33] an adult
[44:35] I was going to speak about the mark of a
[44:37] mature Christian or maybe I'll start on
[44:39] that vein maybe this will be a
[44:41] foundation I don't know but you know
[44:43] we're called that we're no longer tossed
[44:45] to and fro and you see a and I want to
[44:48] take the natural development of a person
[44:49] and parallel with the spiritual because
[44:52] you know I can take my own upbringing I
[44:56] wanted to be a cricketer then I wanted
[44:58] to be in America's Cup
[44:59] then I wanted to make computer games
[45:01] they don't want it to you know I want to
[45:03] do all different kinds of things was
[45:04] being tossed to and fro something was
[45:07] put in front of me all I want it now
[45:09] this is fun for me now I want to be this
[45:10] and oh and I read something I want to do
[45:13] this why I'm being tossed to and fro I
[45:15] mean and and and that's what it's like
[45:18] being a child in the Lord you can be
[45:19] tossed to and fro by every wind of
[45:21] doctrine why because there's part of you
[45:23] that's not fully developed now the brain
[45:31] maybe I'll say this so the definition of
[45:34] maturity it's a quality or state of
[45:38] being mature especially a full
[45:40] development and that's that's that's one
[45:44] of the definitions now I want to speak
[45:47] about how the brain develops because you
[45:49] know then take it into the spiritual
[45:53] because because you know we know wisdom
[45:56] doesn't come with age even though it
[45:59] should Jobe speaks about it people can
[46:02] be old but they can be unwise right but
[46:05] what happens really is that this world
[46:07] is engineered that especially men do not
[46:11] become men the same thing with women too
[46:14] but but this whole society is engineered
[46:16] that men physically become men but and
[46:19] their maturity and their emotional state
[46:21] and their thinking they're not men
[46:22] they're still boys the whole world has
[46:25] engineered this way and so that and the
[46:28] reason is because the devil knows how we
[46:31] work he knows how we develop he knows he
[46:35] studied you he studied mankind for a
[46:37] long time so he wants to stop you
[46:40] becoming what God has ordained you to be
[46:43] a meant and if he can't get you on some
[46:46] wild fanaticism or some false religion
[46:49] he'll get you by trying to stop you
[46:51] developing in your emotional realm
[46:54] because therefore you can't handle
[46:56] decisions you can't handle the
[46:58] challenges of life and you just run like
[47:00] a child instead of becoming the person
[47:04] you meant to become now brother Bram
[47:07] says this this is just in the spiritual
[47:09] sighs he's in the seal of the Antichrist
[47:11] fifty five man usually when he's born in
[47:13] the kingdom of God his face sits right
[47:16] straight towards Calvary now if he's
[47:18] just a little bit emotional he will go
[47:21] off on fanaticism if he's just a little
[47:24] if he's just a little bit his shrewd
[47:28] education he will get so starchy till he
[47:31] sits over on this side that's right but
[47:34] the true Church of the Living God goes
[47:36] right down to the center of the highway
[47:38] preaching his Saints old gospel calling
[47:41] from both sides amen that's what we need
[47:43] today a church that he wouldn't be
[47:44] ashamed for anyone to come into it's
[47:47] perfectly governed by the holy spirit no
[47:49] fanaticism no starchy just a good warm
[47:52] church filled with the holy go holy
[47:54] spirit watch that the good solid gospel
[47:56] teaching passes us what we need amen god
[47:59] help us to have it God wants us to have
[48:02] it so he's saying that the devil will
[48:05] use our nature against us so we're a bit
[48:08] emotional we try and get us off into
[48:10] fanaticism amen and then if we are
[48:12] shrewd and educational then he'll get a
[48:14] starchy but if we keep it under prayer
[48:17] we'll go down the middle of the road
[48:19] Amen so I just put that in there because
[48:21] the devil knows how to use our nature's
[48:24] against us now brother Ram says this and
[48:29] divine healing I hope you just don't
[48:31] mind a bit of reading BCS now we must
[48:34] contend it is the new birth if a if a
[48:38] birth is born from the arts I mean from
[48:39] the inside out the child that it grows
[48:42] if it lives if it doesn't it remains is
[48:44] that right well when a birth is on the
[48:46] inside shouldn't it grow Christ is in
[48:48] your heart ought to be growing daily
[48:49] getting better more powerful
[48:51] understanding things better forgiving
[48:53] walking as God would till Christ be
[48:56] formed in you the hope of glory he says
[48:58] we must contend with the weak until
[49:00] they're fully mature in Christ Jesus
[49:02] then the
[49:03] good soldiers then they've got on the
[49:05] full armor talk about them don't hurt
[49:07] them laugh at them make fun of them
[49:08] don't pay don't they don't pay no
[49:11] attention to it they've got one thing
[49:14] they're just so big my just so full of
[49:16] glory the only thing you have to do is
[49:19] drop this old robe of flesh and just go
[49:21] right on to glory see somebody say you
[49:24] know now this is the contending part
[49:26] somebody said well you know somebody
[49:28] said you was a hypocrite mrs. Jones and
[49:31] the answer did well god bless them do
[49:34] you know a certain certain thing is
[49:35] going on at that church you want to be
[49:37] going well I'll pray for it see that's
[49:39] big oh my your little then you say oh is
[49:42] it let me get in which side must I join
[49:45] see that's where you get in trouble
[49:47] that's where that's where you can't
[49:50] mature but when you get big enough large
[49:53] enough you see swelled out not only
[49:55] swelled up but grow it out Christ
[49:57] growing in you growing out melis taking
[50:00] it out if you push it out as God comes
[50:01] in it just pushes out you say oh how
[50:04] little how juvenile it is how much kid
[50:07] it is to argue and fuss but the first
[50:09] thing you know that just grows over the
[50:11] top of it ain't got no more room for it
[50:13] oh I used to hate to see this and hate
[50:16] that but you know I just got so I just
[50:19] got so I just don't pay any more
[50:21] attention to it no more see you growing
[50:23] yes sir
[50:25] hallelujah amen I'm done done groped now
[50:29] from your heart your your love you had
[50:32] for him till you can brighter your
[50:34] tongue brother that's a great thing
[50:37] amen see we're going to grow we're on
[50:39] our Road I mean we're we're we're
[50:42] basking in the presence of the you know
[50:43] your brother Graham said that the the
[50:45] church has just got to sit in the
[50:47] presence of the Sun until it bakes out
[50:49] all the greenness I mean that's why it's
[50:51] so important to be in the presence of
[50:54] the Lord he'll break out the greenness
[50:56] he'll bring the maturity hallelujah
[51:00] now there's two parts to the brain that
[51:07] are developing well in a teenager now we
[51:11] all went through this track I trust if
[51:13] you got two adult brain you adults now
[51:16] so it seems that experiments have shown
[51:19] that most teens often think with their
[51:22] feelings now I'm just going to show you
[51:24] you know kids seem to go so well then
[51:26] they go crazy
[51:27] it seems they had an age and what's
[51:28] happened to them one part of their brain
[51:31] is become fully developed and the other
[51:33] part is still developing and one is the
[51:36] and and and the but that develops first
[51:39] as as the part where they don't think
[51:43] before they act they just do their do
[51:44] crazy things there that's the fully
[51:46] emotional side it just goes wild and
[51:48] then the check of that is to actually
[51:50] sit back and actually examine things
[51:53] before you do that takes a while to grow
[51:55] I want you to on we need to understand
[52:00] our children and children you need to
[52:02] understand yourself I mean so I trust
[52:05] this help somebody
[52:06] right so experiments show this is just
[52:08] off the antenna I did some research
[52:11] looked at a few sites these experiments
[52:12] I have been done to show that teens
[52:14] often think with their feelings if you
[52:17] feel happy you're happy if you're down
[52:19] you're down in your you can't you know
[52:21] who's been there or might just talking
[52:24] about my past you know they often think
[52:28] with their feelings they can't control
[52:29] their emotion why because their brain is
[52:31] developing it's normal it's normal to go
[52:35] you're feeling like you're about to walk
[52:37] into heaven then your brother punches
[52:38] you and you're so angry and you do and
[52:40] you can't control it what's that it's
[52:42] normal or vice versa but you have to you
[52:50] have to know yourself because many times
[52:52] we don't understand how we're built and
[52:55] the devil will use that void against us
[52:57] okay so so scans of the brain have been
[53:00] done to show that different parts light
[53:02] up when they're being used now with
[53:04] adults and teens look at faces showing
[53:07] different emotions the part of their
[53:09] brain that lights up a different now who
[53:11] seen those kind of things you know they
[53:13] they they they scan the brain when when
[53:16] people look at different things that
[53:17] lights up certain because it's not just
[53:19] one part of your brain being used it's
[53:20] multiple parts and we need different
[53:22] things different parts are activated
[53:24] okay so in adults and teens look at
[53:26] faces showing emotions the part
[53:28] different parts of
[53:30] brain light up adults use their
[53:33] prefrontal cortex to look at faces and
[53:36] try and decide what emotion is happening
[53:38] now that part is still developing in the
[53:40] teenage brain teenagers use their no
[53:44] please Amy go okay my G da la there we
[53:51] go that thing rather than their
[53:53] prefrontal cortex most of the time so in
[53:56] other words they use their emotions to
[53:58] try and understand emotion yes
[54:03] pennies drop to understand how this
[54:07] feels
[54:08] imagine you've lost your keys and you're
[54:10] already late for work think about how
[54:13] many times you look for the keys in the
[54:14] same place 10 5 maybe 20 you panic
[54:17] you're no longer using your cortex
[54:20] you'll use your thinking with your
[54:22] emotions you're not thinking straight
[54:24] who's been in the panic what's happening
[54:26] you're now being governed by your
[54:27] emotion now you take that and then you
[54:30] basically apply it to 98% of all
[54:32] teenagers most of the time that's how
[54:35] they are their what their feelings are
[54:36] up the door
[54:37] the world's gonna end it's just here
[54:40] it's fine
[54:41] you know I can't I did this as it's gone
[54:43] all wrong what's happened their emotions
[54:45] are driving them listen you can't you
[54:50] gotta wait for your brain to develop and
[54:52] then it'll come into balance but it's in
[54:55] those crucial years where the devil
[54:58] comes in this whole world is governed
[55:01] against because he doesn't want us to
[55:02] become adults he wants us to stay
[55:05] children and adult bodies who's heard
[55:08] the term man boy or boy man either one
[55:12] what's happened there's a generation of
[55:14] men they're still boys but they're men
[55:16] physically what's happened the devil's
[55:20] garden and he's wired them because our
[55:25] our brains are being wired when we're
[55:27] growing up
[55:28] there's connection neurons connecting
[55:30] and what happens is the devil takes us
[55:34] and why's our brain based on what we're
[55:37] stimulated by and it produces addiction
[55:43] okay as you've won following me so far
[55:47] now often teens can misinterpret
[55:50] emotions and they see anger when it's
[55:53] really just you feeling anxious why our
[55:56] children misunderstand us this can often
[55:59] lead to many moments of miscommunication
[56:01] so when you're talking to teenagers be
[56:03] careful to check what emotion they are
[56:05] seeing in you and make sure you always
[56:08] acknowledge your emotions first and then
[56:10] help them and then help them to be able
[56:12] to think about what they are feeling see
[56:15] many times we don't understand what
[56:17] we're feeling even as adults but that
[56:21] doesn't mean we should just shut
[56:22] ourselves down because there's two you
[56:24] know it's two ends of the spectrum
[56:26] people become emotionally dead being a
[56:30] hard man you don't feel things this is
[56:33] why this valley the this world that's
[56:36] part of where we live is in such a chaos
[56:38] because man has just sealed themselves
[56:41] away and they can't deal with their
[56:42] emotions and then when it becomes too
[56:44] much they lash out very violently become
[56:46] very aggressive because it's either
[56:48] nothing or super aggression this is why
[56:51] this is why where we are here in stocks
[56:53] values like that because society's
[56:56] injured need men that they can't
[56:58] actually express how they feel and deal
[57:01] with how they're feeling you know
[57:03] probably one of the worst things that
[57:05] you know maybe me but when I was growing
[57:08] up how are you feeling you know it can
[57:11] be one of the worst things you could be
[57:12] asked I don't want to deal with it but
[57:16] you know most of the time if you don't
[57:22] want to deal with it it's actually the
[57:24] best thing to deal with they meant now
[57:29] adults so now you have to so this is
[57:38] adults so so what can help in brain
[57:40] development because everything that we
[57:42] we're come in contact with why is this
[57:45] everything okay so our relationship in
[57:49] our family why is this our friends why
[57:53] are this what we behold why is this
[57:57] okay I'm coming down I'm going real slow
[58:00] because oh you know it's not always that
[58:03] jumpy shouting times God's a God of
[58:06] variety and I press yeah I just trust
[58:09] that this help somebody
[58:10] okay adults who talk to children as
[58:13] they're growing up really help is the
[58:16] first thing this website listed adults
[58:18] talking to children as they're growing
[58:19] up really help what's that a
[58:21] relationship and not a relationship just
[58:24] out of well I'm mum or I'm dad your kids
[58:26] therefore I've got to do this now from
[58:28] their heart you know I was going to
[58:30] preach a sermon but I'll do it next time
[58:32] as that the Lord dealt with me a couple
[58:34] of weeks ago saying you're just going
[58:36] through the motions and that's why
[58:38] you're getting annoyed at your girls
[58:39] because you're going through the motions
[58:41] you've shut yourself away and you're not
[58:44] emotionally there for them you're not
[58:45] connected emotionally with them and
[58:46] that's why you're annoyed with them you
[58:48] can't be shut away this is what the Lord
[58:51] was dealing with me so you can be you
[58:53] can be in a family everyone's in a
[58:55] family here even if the families on the
[58:58] other side of the world you can be in a
[58:59] family you can be living in a house with
[59:01] your family and be an individual you can
[59:04] be hidden away you can be all there how
[59:07] you doing good house thanks good you
[59:09] know the Minear lunch good
[59:12] are you listening good now you're not
[59:13] listening to me you know what's
[59:16] happening you become a you're isolated
[59:18] but you're living with your family the
[59:21] devil that's what the devil wants to
[59:23] achieve because if he isolates then he
[59:26] can deal with and his dealing is
[59:28] destruction now a safe environment where
[59:33] they have consistent loving support is
[59:36] vital for brain development to me for
[59:39] the brain to develop well a consistent
[59:41] loving support amen
[59:44] communication consistent loving support
[59:48] if we want who wants your children to be
[59:52] deformed who wants them to be the best
[59:56] they can be
[59:59] love and communication consistent loving
[1:00:03] support this is what the devil's
[1:00:05] destroyed family in this hour they need
[1:00:09] clear consistent boundaries teenagers
[1:00:13] respond better to rewards the to
[1:00:15] punishment I whose teenagers here you
[1:00:24] should have said preach it brother Ben
[1:00:25] preach with me I won't reward and set a
[1:00:29] punishment amen
[1:00:30] come on you can't say Amen - maybe just
[1:00:36] pitchfork anyway any clear consistent
[1:00:38] boundaries and very importantly their
[1:00:40] growing capacity and ability to do
[1:00:42] things independently needs to be
[1:00:44] respected as their brain grows it gets
[1:00:47] connected function functionally they
[1:00:49] need to learn that they don't have to be
[1:00:51] dependent on their parents but can
[1:00:53] become interdependent with other adults
[1:00:55] as they mature basically they will
[1:00:57] become functioning adults adulting they
[1:01:01] call it or we add all thing today have
[1:01:04] you heard that phrase adult you never
[1:01:07] heard that well it's hard to do adulting
[1:01:09] that's what my work colleagues you said
[1:01:10] my old work they're in their 20s no a
[1:01:15] dull thing it's no you're an adult but
[1:01:19] you got to be a fully mature emotional
[1:01:21] adult now so another principals I'll
[1:01:27] just read so so the brain is developed
[1:01:28] in a way that produces a lot of
[1:01:30] connections that are then removed if
[1:01:32] they are not used so take care to
[1:01:34] encourage lots of connections to be you
[1:01:36] so in other words if you have no
[1:01:38] relationship with your children then
[1:01:40] that part of their brain that's
[1:01:41] connected where they communicate
[1:01:43] effectively is shut down
[1:01:45] it's use it or you use it or lose it
[1:01:47] even when they're growing another
[1:01:51] principle and other principles that win
[1:01:54] with when the brain connects they fire
[1:01:58] see so those that fire together they
[1:02:00] wire together the different pathways in
[1:02:01] your brain so so for example if you do a
[1:02:04] lot of physical activity then the part
[1:02:07] of your brain is wired together where
[1:02:09] you're used to it
[1:02:10] you enjoy it
[1:02:11] but if you never do any physical
[1:02:13] activity playing a game can be a chore
[1:02:15] and you don't enjoy it why cuz that part
[1:02:16] your brains not wired or if you have no
[1:02:18] discipline to study if you are you know
[1:02:20] if you're disciplined in you and you can
[1:02:22] study what's happen as a part of your
[1:02:23] pathway is wired you can actually put in
[1:02:25] the time and effort but if you're lazy
[1:02:27] you never do anything that part is not
[1:02:28] connected like it should be or if you
[1:02:32] never help around the house eventually
[1:02:35] you're gonna have to help around your
[1:02:37] own house member occupy blessed are
[1:02:40] those servants that have found doing
[1:02:42] when he comes doing what it comes down
[1:02:44] to everyday life you know this world has
[1:02:46] engineered that we're always looking for
[1:02:48] tomorrow I member even at school a big
[1:02:51] Monday morning kids in class will be
[1:02:53] talking about next weekend what are we
[1:02:54] gonna do next weekend what are we gonna
[1:02:56] do next weekend instead of what about
[1:02:58] today it's we're gonna live in the today
[1:03:01] but the devil doesn't want us to live in
[1:03:03] the today he wants us to wait for our
[1:03:06] holiday or wait for Christmas or wait
[1:03:08] for some summertime or some season that
[1:03:10] we enjoy and you missed now that's why I
[1:03:13] think you know we know time does fly but
[1:03:16] you know we don't want to come to a
[1:03:17] place with life so for example me if the
[1:03:20] Lord should tarry
[1:03:21] I don't want to come to a place where
[1:03:23] there yeah big and I'm shocked how did
[1:03:25] you get that big
[1:03:26] that means I've missed all the age where
[1:03:29] they develop emotionally and physically
[1:03:32] from here to there you know oh when they
[1:03:35] grow up then they'll be good know it
[1:03:37] starts now if you want them good when
[1:03:40] they're adults you need to start now if
[1:03:41] you want to be their friend when you're
[1:03:43] when they're adults you need to start
[1:03:44] now amen
[1:03:48] now now teenage teenage brains are not
[1:03:52] fully developed so some areas aren't
[1:03:54] completely online the most important of
[1:03:57] these areas are the prefrontal cortex
[1:03:58] which controls reasoning and teen
[1:04:02] emotion and self-regulation as a result
[1:04:05] teens can be very impulsive and moody
[1:04:09] yes now it's not when you hit 13 this
[1:04:13] happens you can be earlier than 13 yeah
[1:04:16] and because brain development and
[1:04:19] decision-making are closely related
[1:04:22] adolescents aren't as good as planning
[1:04:24] ahead
[1:04:25] making careful decisions you know I
[1:04:27] often think why didn't I think like this
[1:04:29] when I was a teenager I couldn't because
[1:04:32] I had a teenage brain that's why brother
[1:04:34] am said think there say
[1:04:35] fourteen-year-old think thought
[1:04:37] fourteen-year-old thoughts
[1:04:38] think what you like when you're that age
[1:04:41] they'll probably one like the same thing
[1:04:42] because they are made in your image see
[1:04:45] so your personality they'll have a men
[1:04:49] things you like they like now the brain
[1:04:55] so the brain develops and a back to
[1:05:00] front pattern hits fourth prefrontal
[1:05:01] cortex development as the last part of
[1:05:03] the brain maturation process as a result
[1:05:07] teen brain development is not yet
[1:05:09] complete so the lack of the frontal lobe
[1:05:11] maturity catalyzes as a variety of teen
[1:05:14] behaviors so these so that's because the
[1:05:17] prefrontal cortex now I'm coming to
[1:05:19] something there's a reason I'm reading
[1:05:21] this okay there's a reason I'm reading
[1:05:23] this so so just bear with me
[1:05:25] basically teenagers half your brain is
[1:05:27] working the other half is catching up
[1:05:29] and they're catching up part is what you
[1:05:31] need but that part is the part the devil
[1:05:34] wants to destroy before it becomes
[1:05:36] online now that's because the prefrontal
[1:05:42] cortex is involved with a wide range of
[1:05:44] functions known as executive functions
[1:05:46] these include the following complex
[1:05:49] decision-making planning skills impulse
[1:05:51] control emotional reactions focusing
[1:05:54] attention prioritizing competing
[1:05:56] information received all at once the
[1:05:58] ability to ignore external distractions
[1:06:01] these things have to develop in the
[1:06:03] brain
[1:06:04] now therefore children and teenagers are
[1:06:06] unable to to access certain skills and
[1:06:09] abilities until later and the frontal
[1:06:11] lobe development process consequently
[1:06:13] lack of executive functions can result
[1:06:16] in teen risky behavior and lack of
[1:06:18] emotional self-regulation skills can
[1:06:21] affect teens mental health
[1:06:23] moreover teens are also dealing with
[1:06:25] hormones as a result of puberty now the
[1:06:28] devil knows this and that's why he's
[1:06:32] engineered society that it's a pleasure
[1:06:35] driven world
[1:06:37] because I said those parts of the brain
[1:06:41] that fire together they are wired
[1:06:43] together and that's where diction comes
[1:06:46] in so that's why now why is Facebook so
[1:06:53] big because people use it why is YouTube
[1:06:57] so big because people use it why why do
[1:07:01] people use it because it's addictive
[1:07:06] it's that simple
[1:07:07] why you know any great consumable why is
[1:07:12] it so such a big brand why is coca-cola
[1:07:15] such a big big brand cuz people buy it
[1:07:18] why do people buy it because it tastes
[1:07:21] good if it tasted like dirt no one's
[1:07:25] gonna buy it if Facebook was useless no
[1:07:29] one would be using it it's really quite
[1:07:31] simple the reason that if one use it is
[1:07:34] because it's addictive and it's the
[1:07:37] addictive bit that catches people and
[1:07:41] now this is not just teenagers this is
[1:07:43] adults because this world is the most
[1:07:47] addicted world there is there has never
[1:07:49] been a generation of people on the earth
[1:07:52] that us that are addicts as much as
[1:07:55] today this world society has been
[1:08:00] engineered to break the family
[1:08:01] relationship so that children do not
[1:08:04] become adults but they stay children so
[1:08:07] when they physically become adults they
[1:08:08] are not emotionally or mentally adults
[1:08:13] now you shouldn't be surprised when I
[1:08:17] say that the world is is addicted now I
[1:08:22] remember now it was a key week who's the
[1:08:25] key we could hear my age okay who
[1:08:30] remembers the life education trust
[1:08:33] Harold the giraffe okay now I remember
[1:08:39] in those lessons there's the bus and
[1:08:41] Harold was the puppet and you know stay
[1:08:42] away from drugs kids and it's bad and
[1:08:44] you know so we were told don't hit don't
[1:08:48] do drugs and a
[1:08:50] destroys your brain don't do this but
[1:08:54] did it stop us doing it
[1:08:57] education this world are so educated
[1:09:00] about drug use and misuse and what it
[1:09:03] does but doesn't stop people taking them
[1:09:06] why is that because man has a fall of
[1:09:08] nature that we're born with and will
[1:09:11] always go to the lowest denominator of
[1:09:13] our society and so what that means is
[1:09:16] that there will knows that even if you
[1:09:18] may know mentally something is not right
[1:09:20] if your heart has not been turned you'll
[1:09:22] go that way so so Harold told us that
[1:09:29] drugs will destroy your brain and many
[1:09:33] of the neurons in your brain are still
[1:09:34] forming connections well into your 20s
[1:09:37] so and the more you take drugs the more
[1:09:41] that your you know your your brain won't
[1:09:45] form like it should and that would begin
[1:09:47] to manifest in a person's behavior and
[1:09:49] ability to remember things and so on so
[1:09:52] I said the strange thing is the more
[1:09:54] education we get on the harm of drinking
[1:09:56] drugs and so on it doesn't stop people
[1:09:58] doing them it's because a man's fallen
[1:10:00] nature but this is not just a result of
[1:10:03] taking physical substance by any cuz any
[1:10:06] addiction will do the same now as I said
[1:10:09] this world is the most addictive it's
[1:10:12] ever been consumable technology is
[1:10:15] designed to be addictive that's why
[1:10:17] YouTube is so popular Facebook social
[1:10:19] media Instagram because what it does is
[1:10:22] now who knows about the chemical
[1:10:25] dopamine now this is a different kind of
[1:10:27] service but I trust you're listening now
[1:10:30] dopamine is a chemical it's the main
[1:10:32] chemical of pleasure so when you're
[1:10:34] enjoying something your brain produces a
[1:10:36] chemical called dopamine and you feel
[1:10:38] good it's a chemical because it's
[1:10:41] chemical reactions going on in your body
[1:10:43] though always so when you do something
[1:10:46] you like your brain produces dopamine
[1:10:48] and your brain is now making memory
[1:10:50] saying you enjoyed this you're enjoying
[1:10:54] this and so what happens is so dopamine
[1:10:59] is produced it's the main chemical of
[1:11:03] pleasure
[1:11:04] and what it does then as as that
[1:11:07] actually tell makes you it motivates you
[1:11:12] to do the same behavior again and so
[1:11:15] what it does so in other words dopamine
[1:11:19] the more dopamine your brain produces
[1:11:20] when you do something more you'll do it
[1:11:23] okay so this social mean this is why
[1:11:33] Facebook is addictive it produces
[1:11:37] dopamine in your brain I'm holding up a
[1:11:39] phone because there's normally you know
[1:11:40] why do people live on their phones as I
[1:11:43] see it member the devil's designed this
[1:11:45] world that people don't want to be in
[1:11:47] the real world they want to escape
[1:11:49] that's why this world is full of fantasy
[1:11:52] TV programs or movies or fan stuff and
[1:11:56] people dress up as their favorite
[1:11:57] characters and you know because they
[1:12:00] wanted to escape this world why is that
[1:12:02] because they're addicted why do people
[1:12:06] live on their phones because they're
[1:12:08] unhappy with their current state because
[1:12:11] their brain has become why that they're
[1:12:13] addicted to this social Internet
[1:12:16] addiction social media addiction gaming
[1:12:19] addiction is a real thing and there's a
[1:12:22] spirit all you know it's very easy I'll
[1:12:24] just say this I'll be honest
[1:12:27] drinking alcohol there's a spirit behind
[1:12:29] it as spirit comes in you and feeds off
[1:12:33] the alcohol you're drinking it's an
[1:12:36] addiction there's a thirst in your body
[1:12:38] that's not from your originally that's
[1:12:41] hungry for it and you got to feed that
[1:12:43] desire you can be addicted to your phone
[1:12:47] exactly the same way because you know
[1:12:50] people people that are drunks are
[1:12:53] drinking to cope with life and there's
[1:12:56] such a thing as a as a what he called a
[1:13:01] basically a drunk who can basically live
[1:13:03] their life normally but they're drunk ok
[1:13:06] the term just escapes me just now and so
[1:13:08] now so what is it someone can be drunk
[1:13:10] but go to the job raise their children
[1:13:13] live on essentially a normal kind of
[1:13:15] life but they're drunk
[1:13:16] what's
[1:13:18] they're addicted there's a spirit of
[1:13:20] them they need to feed that spirit in
[1:13:22] order to cope with life and it's the
[1:13:24] same thing why do people live on their
[1:13:25] cell phones because they can't cope with
[1:13:27] everyday life they're addicted you know
[1:13:30] pick yo this been studies proven that
[1:13:33] Internet addiction and depression are
[1:13:35] linked it's a proven fact that social
[1:13:39] media addiction I say Internet addiction
[1:13:41] I'm just going to put it in one big
[1:13:42] blanket because it's all of us it leads
[1:13:45] to depression because people see this
[1:13:48] world and they want this fantasy world
[1:13:50] that they can never actually obtain that
[1:13:52] fantasy world and they become depressed
[1:13:57] same thing with gaming social media the
[1:14:00] internet it's there's a reason why it's
[1:14:03] called the world wide web brother who
[1:14:06] speaks about a web of fashion that that
[1:14:08] women can't get out of this stuck
[1:14:10] I say these it's not just that now but
[1:14:13] there is a web that people are stuck in
[1:14:17] and they can't get out they can the Lord
[1:14:20] can get them out but you got to want to
[1:14:23] get out but the problem is because your
[1:14:25] brain has become wide that you're
[1:14:26] addicted to the thing it's very hard
[1:14:29] unless and this you really want it you
[1:14:32] will still be an addict you know there's
[1:14:35] a there's actually a symptom of people
[1:14:37] who are dry drunks where they don't
[1:14:40] drink but they still show the symptoms
[1:14:42] of those who drink not in terms of
[1:14:45] impairment staggering around but impulse
[1:14:47] decisions rash behavior you know
[1:14:49] breaking your relationships with those
[1:14:52] of the thing you know your others and so
[1:14:54] on what's that they're actually dried
[1:14:56] drugs they're still the spirit of them
[1:14:57] but they've somehow in their own human
[1:14:59] ability have stopped drinking but
[1:15:01] there's still that spirit in them crying
[1:15:03] out so they still have behaviors that
[1:15:06] are as if they were still drinking
[1:15:09] medically proven this is the world we
[1:15:14] live in and it's not just that now and
[1:15:19] the reason I say that is because many
[1:15:22] times you know we say well get the
[1:15:24] shotgun breathe
[1:15:26] b-brother boom boom and blow out the TV
[1:15:28] right brother I said get the shotgun
[1:15:30] blow out the TV
[1:15:31] you know brother boom-boom - two shots
[1:15:35] and it's gone and many times we'll apply
[1:15:38] the same thing get it out the house get
[1:15:40] rid of it but if it's still in here it's
[1:15:43] not going to do any good cuz it'll come
[1:15:45] back it'll come back greater then then
[1:15:48] when it left I remember it was taken out
[1:15:50] of here
[1:15:51] hallelujah then you can live in no
[1:15:54] lemmings and you won't be addicted to it
[1:15:57] it's like I could literally live in a
[1:15:59] brewery now I'll never be I never drink
[1:16:01] a drop because it's not in here to have
[1:16:03] it I mean so somes now so you've got to
[1:16:10] look into it and and that's why people
[1:16:12] you'll see people will be on their phone
[1:16:14] and they'll send messengers around the
[1:16:16] start what's happening everyone and and
[1:16:18] texting everyone because they're waiting
[1:16:20] for a response and when they get a
[1:16:21] response with heaven dopamine is ignited
[1:16:25] in their brain they're upset now okay
[1:16:27] there's nothing wrong with texting
[1:16:29] people you understand but who's even
[1:16:32] been in a place where you feel down and
[1:16:33] then you start messaging people for no
[1:16:35] real reason
[1:16:36] posting things on Facebook how many
[1:16:38] likes might get Instagram whatever and
[1:16:40] you're trying to get a response back
[1:16:42] what's that you're feeding an addiction
[1:16:46] there's been studies done I'm not just
[1:16:50] making things up but the thing is now if
[1:16:53] someone you know you know if someone
[1:16:56] came in here with needle holes in their
[1:16:59] arm you think man that person's in
[1:17:02] trouble they're addicted to a heroin or
[1:17:05] whatever they've got a spirit on them
[1:17:07] but then what about people who are
[1:17:09] depressed and they're addicted to this
[1:17:11] that may sound extreme but I want you to
[1:17:13] think about it why do we need to live
[1:17:15] the devil's real subtle he just wants to
[1:17:18] rob you of the life of God he wants to
[1:17:21] break your channel break your
[1:17:22] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:24] where it's no longer you no longer
[1:17:27] walking with him in victory because if
[1:17:29] you walk with him in victory then your
[1:17:30] family will come I mean because remember
[1:17:33] remember 99% of our Christian Walker's
[1:17:36] not in these four walls Church starts at
[1:17:39] home revival starts at home I mean and
[1:17:42] the thing is 99% of our Christian
[1:17:45] walk that our children see is not when
[1:17:48] we read this to them it's the life we
[1:17:50] live in front of them that shows what
[1:17:53] kind of Christian we are amen
[1:17:56] so we gotta you know it's not just you
[1:17:57] push a button now I'm in message mode
[1:17:59] and Here I am I've got my tie and praise
[1:18:01] the Lord and you know doing some
[1:18:03] stretches before I shout and you know do
[1:18:06] some vocal trait I believe in shouting
[1:18:08] but you know it's not they do some
[1:18:10] stretches and come into church and
[1:18:12] anything you walk out you Misha's yeah
[1:18:14] yo yo message mode off live any kind of
[1:18:17] life no 24/7 we're believers 24/7 so you
[1:18:26] got to see yo what is actually allow
[1:18:28] what is making me cope in life
[1:18:30] what's your coping mechanism is that the
[1:18:33] Lord or is that your phone is that
[1:18:35] YouTube you know what is it what makes
[1:18:39] you happy what gives you peace is it
[1:18:43] watching a football star or is it
[1:18:44] watching something on than thing or what
[1:18:46] you know what makes you happier because
[1:18:48] you know I mean you know we have to come
[1:18:50] to a conclusion that if we are I'm gonna
[1:18:54] wrap this up real quick but when it come
[1:18:56] to a conclusion what makes us happy in
[1:18:58] life what's our source of comfort
[1:19:00] because whatever our source of comfort
[1:19:03] is when the going gets hard that's what
[1:19:05] will retreat to we will hurt that is our
[1:19:09] hiding place to the other Bible says in
[1:19:11] Psalms thirty-two 7 thou art my hiding
[1:19:13] place thou shalt preserve me from
[1:19:16] trouble thou shalt come pass me about
[1:19:18] with the songs of deliverance so what is
[1:19:20] your hiding place as at this or is it
[1:19:24] him Amen because we can we can have a
[1:19:29] bit of the Lord but is he your hiding
[1:19:31] place as a year or all and all because
[1:19:33] you can be you can be hidden away in the
[1:19:36] mountains or in suburbia but you can
[1:19:39] just be hidden away in something it's
[1:19:43] not just geographical location now we
[1:19:46] know that the Bible says in Psalms 1921
[1:19:49] there are many devices in the man's
[1:19:51] heart
[1:19:51] nevertheless the counselor Lord shall
[1:19:54] stand and the different translation the
[1:19:56] word English Bible says there are many
[1:19:57] plans in a man
[1:19:58] heart but pardon me but Yahweh's counsel
[1:20:01] will prevail so there's many plans in
[1:20:03] our heart now many times the devil will
[1:20:05] trick us saying well because you have
[1:20:07] another desire in your heart other than
[1:20:09] serving the Lord therefore you're not
[1:20:11] really a Christian amen
[1:20:14] you know because we have a lot of plant
[1:20:16] you know this flesh has a lot of ideas
[1:20:18] that's why it's got to die that's why
[1:20:21] you've got to come to a death that's why
[1:20:24] I said you know you can kick out all the
[1:20:26] technology you want and say I'll never
[1:20:27] look at Facebook again or you know the
[1:20:29] internet again but if is the desire and
[1:20:31] here then it's still you're basically a
[1:20:33] dry drunk but if you die to that first
[1:20:36] you die to that spirit I mean it will be
[1:20:39] taken from you that's why you've got to
[1:20:41] die to the thing because you you you're
[1:20:43] gonna kill your enemy or your your enemy
[1:20:46] will kill you amen so there's many plans
[1:20:51] in a man's heart and we know when we go
[1:20:55] from children to to being a teenager
[1:20:57] that's when the world opens up to us
[1:21:00] amen if you're a boy you find out that
[1:21:03] girls are not ugly yucky things they
[1:21:05] become nice things amen and vice versa
[1:21:09] they're not so yucky after all so this
[1:21:13] you know so there's many things that are
[1:21:16] going on in your life as if one
[1:21:18] following me so that so therefore you've
[1:21:20] got different desires that you never had
[1:21:22] you now find yourself having there is
[1:21:24] big chaos going on but the thing is it
[1:21:27] doesn't matter I'll say this the Lord
[1:21:30] has given us something to overcome with
[1:21:33] right and many times we think well
[1:21:37] that's the Holy Ghost and it is but if
[1:21:40] you don't have the Holy Ghost God the
[1:21:41] Lord still gives you something to
[1:21:42] overcome with he still gives you
[1:21:45] something that you can overcome because
[1:21:46] you know if we say well you just need
[1:21:48] the Holy Ghost then you'll overcome be
[1:21:50] say well I don't have the Holy Ghost so
[1:21:51] how can I overcome you following me but
[1:21:54] he gives us something that causes us
[1:21:57] that we can get the victory and it's
[1:21:59] real simple
[1:22:00] that victory is athirst their victory is
[1:22:03] a hunger that victory is a desire for
[1:22:06] God amen it can be the smallest hunger
[1:22:09] in your heart but as long as you've got
[1:22:10] it
[1:22:11] hello yeah then you just focus on that
[1:22:13] one I mean that's all you need to do I
[1:22:17] trust this kind of wraps it up a little
[1:22:18] bit for you
[1:22:19] I mean but even the smallest desire to
[1:22:21] serve God I would focus on that desire I
[1:22:24] wouldn't worry but the other ones will
[1:22:25] take care of themselves focus on that
[1:22:27] desire to serve God amen and say Lord
[1:22:30] kill all the rest of them out hallelujah
[1:22:32] because that's the biggest thing that
[1:22:33] people face and they and they wrestle
[1:22:35] what they say well but God's pulling me
[1:22:37] that's where the world's pulling me that
[1:22:39] way I know what that was like I was
[1:22:41] there for years I was stuck in this rock
[1:22:42] and a hard place
[1:22:43] yeah but God's calling me he's dealing
[1:22:45] with me but I don't want to lose my
[1:22:47] friends I want to keep my old life I
[1:22:48] mean it was to thirst going on but one
[1:22:51] had to die hallelujah and it's your head
[1:22:54] it's your own choice I mean which will
[1:22:56] dictate which one will die or not I mean
[1:22:58] if you want the world to live in you
[1:23:00] then your choice will be that way but if
[1:23:02] you want God to live in you and you say
[1:23:04] Lord take me I want to serve you I mean
[1:23:06] not because I haven't gotten by my
[1:23:08] emotion or I feel it but because I
[1:23:09] believe you would I thank you in your
[1:23:11] word
[1:23:11] holy I believe you died free I believe
[1:23:13] what your Holy Ghost is for me
[1:23:15] amen and you focus on that desire I mean
[1:23:18] then God will take that desire he'll
[1:23:20] take you hallelujah I want to take this
[1:23:25] as I want to I just want to read this
[1:23:27] quote and then I might leave it there
[1:23:30] because we're gonna go into another part
[1:23:32] of this another time but he says here
[1:23:34] this isn't to whom shall we go 1916 he
[1:23:37] says and it is tonight if you're if
[1:23:42] you're the least desire in your heart to
[1:23:44] serve God who's got the least Azhar in
[1:23:46] their heart to serve God I mean to
[1:23:49] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:23:50] who's got the least desire in their
[1:23:52] heart this is the interactive part of
[1:23:54] the service I put my hand up revised you
[1:23:59] know not honestly be real be real don't
[1:24:02] worry about who's around you as there's
[1:24:04] having a new stake saying I want to be a
[1:24:05] Christian I want to serve God I want to
[1:24:09] be a Christian I want to be identified
[1:24:10] with them if you've got the least desire
[1:24:12] in your heart to receive God to receive
[1:24:15] the Holy Ghost let get in the right
[1:24:18] atmosphere the right mood before God and
[1:24:21] life will come and you just assure
[1:24:24] and you'll start rising to translation

[1:24:29] least desire in your heart to serve God
[1:24:31] to receive the Holy Ghost get in the
[1:24:33] right atmosphere I believe we're in the
[1:24:35] right atmosphere I believe we're in the
[1:24:37] presence of the Lord hallelujah the

[1:24:52] to be a Christian hallelujah

[1:25:57] server that's found when the Lord comes

[1:26:02] with each other
[1:26:03] and family amen I I trust you got
[1:26:07] genuine love and concern for your
[1:26:09] children amen
[1:26:11] you know not just we have to come to a
[1:26:14] point now maybe I'll just I'll just
[1:26:17] paraphrase it brother Graham's asked a
[1:26:19] question in the and the and the certain
[1:26:22] the seals before the seventh seal
[1:26:23] message and an Deniz asked brother
[1:26:26] Branham when the seals come open or when
[1:26:29] the books taking does that mean grace is
[1:26:31] finished he says no grace isn't over he
[1:26:35] says you just go right on
[1:26:37] planting your potatoes be a sweet humble
[1:26:40] Christian keep going to church he says
[1:26:43] well maybe I should just rebut but he
[1:26:45] says otherwise if you lose the he says
[1:26:54] he says no it's not over don't get it on
[1:26:56] your mind just go right on dig the
[1:26:58] potatoes go to church and right on if it
[1:27:00] takes place in the morning you'd be
[1:27:02] found doing just exactly what you're
[1:27:04] supposed to be doing he says don't start
[1:27:05] see when you do you twist the very thing
[1:27:08] away from the purpose that's intended
[1:27:10] for amen so he's saying no so you saying
[1:27:14] build your church I mean your go to
[1:27:16] church thinking potatoes do your job you
[1:27:18] know go to church
[1:27:19] otherwise you'll be twisted away the
[1:27:22] very purpose of digging your potatoes
[1:27:26] I've gone to church it'll take you away
[1:27:29] from the very purpose of it because at
[1:27:31] the end of the day if you do not and
[1:27:33] I'll just leave you with this if you do
[1:27:35] not know your purpose in everyday life
[1:27:37] you will quit living and you just start
[1:27:40] existing and the devil wants us just to
[1:27:43] exist but if we have a vision because
[1:27:46] where there's no vision as the people
[1:27:48] perish but you have to have your own
[1:27:50] vision you've got to be motivated
[1:27:51] yourself
[1:27:52] this does not make us motivated to live
[1:27:54] this makes us motivated to exist okay
[1:27:59] the thing is if you actually understand
[1:28:02] the purpose you know I learned a ton of
[1:28:06] stuff at university I never use what was
[1:28:09] the purpose of it it was to mold
[1:28:12] something into me it's not the head
[1:28:14] dollars necessarily but it's your
[1:28:16] character being molded when you're doing
[1:28:19] the task you following me
[1:28:21] amen yeah because many times the only
[1:28:24] thing what's the point of learning this
[1:28:25] at school well the purpose is right
[1:28:27] there the reason is for that class is
[1:28:29] that you actually learn a bit of
[1:28:30] character and discipline do too you know
[1:28:32] figure things out might not be well
[1:28:36] who's going to use you know trigonometry
[1:28:38] again or calculus integration
[1:28:44] okay not sure of it okay anyway we'll
[1:28:49] leave that hey you know people think
[1:28:51] what's the purpose and then it's like
[1:28:53] same as why do we why do we vacuum the
[1:28:55] carpet it's just gonna get dirty again
[1:28:57] what's the purpose of it if you see
[1:29:00] there's no if you do not see the purpose
[1:29:02] of keeping your house clean amen you
[1:29:05] will stop you'll miss the whole moment
[1:29:07] of what you're actually doing in terms
[1:29:08] of living in the now it's the small
[1:29:11] things God is in the small things God is
[1:29:14] in God is in washing dishes dropping
[1:29:18] kids off at school raising children
[1:29:20] eating your lunch making lunch
[1:29:22] you know and the small things God is in
[1:29:25] the small things but if you miss the
[1:29:27] purpose of those things in your
[1:29:29] motivation goes you won't be found doing
[1:29:31] when he comes you just be found existing
[1:29:35] so you can't don't quit you know because
[1:29:38] that's the problem with this we see a
[1:29:41] filter filtered photoshopped
[1:29:43] you know rendered picture of somewhere
[1:29:46] like we're we were driving around power
[1:29:48] to new Inlet and one of us in the car
[1:29:51] head was taking photos with filters on
[1:29:53] it doesn't look like that in real life
[1:29:56] it looks cool but if someone showed me a
[1:29:59] photo of that and said go look at this
[1:30:01] place is beautiful
[1:30:02] and then Here I am I go to the place and
[1:30:04] say is there something wrong with my
[1:30:06] eyes
[1:30:06] it doesn't look like this at all and you
[1:30:09] get disappointed but if you're actually
[1:30:12] there and you're enjoying the moment
[1:30:14] enjoying the atmosphere enjoying maybe
[1:30:15] the wind on your face and the sunshine
[1:30:17] on you and you know that's why it's so
[1:30:20] nice just to enjoy a moment and not have
[1:30:21] a phone you know why I live through this
[1:30:25] lens when you can live through this lens
[1:30:31] because you're gonna think you know my
[1:30:34] heart's desire is that if the Lord
[1:30:37] should tarry all you young people who
[1:30:40] are the Church of the Church of today
[1:30:42] should we all die we'll just step into
[1:30:44] our place that's that's my heart's
[1:30:48] desire
[1:30:48] right but in order for that to happen
[1:30:51] then you have to grow and mature and the
[1:30:56] Lord
[1:30:57] that you have the same character
[1:30:58] christ-like character that is I pray as
[1:31:00] in us and so we can have this idea of
[1:31:03] people coming to their position but it
[1:31:06] starts with simple things you go read
[1:31:09] David in the Bible he's anointed by
[1:31:11] Samuel he goes back to his father's
[1:31:13] sheep what was the purpose but he's
[1:31:14] anointed to be king what's the purpose
[1:31:16] of looking after sheep he said he's
[1:31:18] under training and then his dad says
[1:31:20] take the food go see your brothers who
[1:31:23] were there at the battle with the
[1:31:24] Philistines
[1:31:25] he's just serving his dad he's just
[1:31:28] doing everyday things amen
[1:31:32] Jesus was subject to Joseph and Mary as
[1:31:35] a child and he obeyed them and God used
[1:31:41] that to Malta's character so me times
[1:31:45] you that well what's the point there is
[1:31:47] a point in everything but if we if we if
[1:31:51] we say well what's the you know who's
[1:31:53] ever felt I'll just I know times gone
[1:31:57] but who's ever felt like what's the
[1:31:59] point of living this life I'm living you
[1:32:04] know what's the point of going to school
[1:32:06] what's the point of learning this why am
[1:32:08] I here what's this all about the devil
[1:32:11] wants us to focus on that because then
[1:32:14] what he does is he gets us to focus
[1:32:16] because you're us why are we here and
[1:32:17] God put you here
[1:32:19] God put you here that in the everyday
[1:32:21] God will meet you
[1:32:23] amen it's in the everyday I've had them
[1:32:26] you're the most wonderful experience
[1:32:27] that I've ever had with the Lord is
[1:32:29] washing dishes and vacuuming some of
[1:32:35] that well some of the biggest blessings
[1:32:37] I've ever got from his word I've been at
[1:32:40] work tipping human urine into tubes in a
[1:32:47] lab coat in a lab working or I've been
[1:32:54] vacuuming or being cleaning or have been
[1:32:57] you know just doing things doing
[1:33:02] everyday things you know because many
[1:33:06] times you think well we've got to be
[1:33:07] shut along with God somewhere in the
[1:33:09] secret place that's all fine
[1:33:11] but God God doesn't just meet us in full
[1:33:13] wall somewhere he's with us everywhere
[1:33:15] but it depends what your mind is caught
[1:33:18] up in it
[1:33:19] depends what you're caught up if you're
[1:33:20] caught up and and and and your phone and
[1:33:23] what's going on out in the world you
[1:33:24] know the world is gonna continue on you
[1:33:27] know the world is not going to fall
[1:33:29] apart because you don't check your
[1:33:30] facebook for the tenth time in the in 15
[1:33:34] minutes you know or you're on YouTube or
[1:33:36] whatever it is the world will continue
[1:33:38] on I'm gonna quit
[1:33:40] I'm gonna stop but the thing is you know
[1:33:44] you got to be shadowed with God wherever
[1:33:46] you are
[1:33:47] he's with you everywhere okay can we
[1:33:51] just stand I'll just leave cuz otherwise
[1:33:53] I'll continue on and had the musicians
[1:33:56] come please can you come forward we'll
[1:34:03] go into it a bit more in depth later
[1:34:05] what's wiring your brain I want the Lord
[1:34:11] to wire my brain I want my family you
[1:34:15] know the biggest way to fix a family
[1:34:18] problem is to actually spend time with
[1:34:20] the family
[1:34:21] brother Bram walked into his house his
[1:34:25] wife's upset the children are fighting
[1:34:27] let's me see
[1:34:29] you know she cuz she's all stressed out
[1:34:31] Australian this people visiting whatever
[1:34:32] more she's about to break down you know
[1:34:34] what he does to fix it
[1:34:36] he doesn't say now come on woman line up
[1:34:39] or I'm the prophet of God or he doesn't
[1:34:41] go off into his den and pray he puts on
[1:34:43] an apron he starts talking about dresses
[1:34:46] and different things about here for his
[1:34:48] wife and thing and he's praying in his
[1:34:50] heart Lord send your Holy Ghost into her

[1:34:59] kids are playing the whole atmosphere in
