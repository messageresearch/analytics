[35:30] read one verse here of
[35:32] john 16 which will be verse 13.
[35:35] amen i like that david he knew god
[35:38] he wasn't worshiping god through someone
[35:40] else's experience
[35:41] wasn't because of his father or mother
[35:43] sister or brother is because he met god
[35:45] himself
[35:46] amen it must be the same way because if
[35:48] we if it's just us and god walking
[35:51] things can come things can go people can
[35:53] leave people can come trouble can come
[35:55] trouble can go but you'll just stay
[35:57] steadfast
[35:59] and you've got to make sure that it's
[36:00] not you and someone else and god it's
[36:01] you and god
[36:03] amen and then so jesus said here in john
[36:05] 16 um yeah john 16 and verse 13
[36:09] uh how be it when he the spirit of truth
[36:12] has come
[36:14] he will guide you
[36:16] into all truth for he shall not speak of
[36:18] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[36:20] that shall he speak and he will show you
[36:23] things to come
[36:25] i mean so he's going to tell you when he
[36:27] comes to you he's going to lead you
[36:30] this is a one-on-one
[36:32] there's a one-on-one you know we know
[36:34] the rapture isn't sure sure it's a body
[36:36] of people being translated but the
[36:38] rapture is individual
[36:39] christianity sure we're a body but
[36:41] christianity is individual
[36:43] you and god
[36:44] amen let's just bow heads and word of
[36:46] prayer tonight i mean if you want to be
[36:48] removed and pray just want to lift up
[36:49] your hand before the lord

[37:03] high tower my buckler my salvation lord

[38:34] service be it those who are streaming
[38:35] tonight those who couldn't make it lord
[38:37] i pray you'd be their portion as well
[38:39] lord may you grant it for your glory we
[38:41] ask all these things in the name of the
[38:42] lord jesus christ amen amen god bless
[38:46] you friends you may have your seats
[38:47] tonight uh so i just want to um take a
[38:50] bit of time here
[38:52] uh
[38:53] i just as i said i love it how david
[38:55] would say the lord is my rock and my
[38:57] fortress
[38:59] my deliverer my god my strength and whom
[39:01] i trust my buckler and the horn of my
[39:02] salvation and my high tower david knew
[39:06] god in a lot of different situations
[39:08] but the main thing is that god was
[39:10] personal to david he wasn't a it wasn't
[39:12] god david did not worship god through
[39:15] his father or his brothers
[39:17] now this is very important because
[39:19] brother branham when he preaches on the
[39:20] message in absolute
[39:22] he he preaches it a couple of times and
[39:25] many times you know there's actually
[39:26] kind of i can put it this way two
[39:28] different kind of absolutes one is the
[39:31] the word of god
[39:32] right that's you say the external
[39:34] absolute but the author has to be the
[39:36] internal absolute
[39:38] within you
[39:39] and that is the main one you've got to
[39:40] have
[39:41] because really you've got to think about
[39:43] it just say if suddenly every bible
[39:45] vanished off the face of the earth all
[39:46] the message books were gone
[39:48] what is going to guide our lives it's
[39:50] got to be the living word inside us and
[39:52] that's really how it should be anyway
[39:53] remember we know the holy ghost feeds on
[39:55] the word so we should read the bible
[39:57] pray every day you know listen to the
[39:58] message feed but what i'm trying to say
[40:00] is it's more than just ink on paper
[40:02] being being our guiding point right it's
[40:05] the lord himself you think about when
[40:07] the apostle paul was here most of the
[40:09] bible wasn't even written
[40:11] they had the old testament they had a
[40:12] collection of letters that were passed
[40:14] around that that the people felt were
[40:16] were the word of god and we know that
[40:18] they are and it was only years years
[40:20] after the apostle paul died i not sure
[40:22] exactly how
[40:23] how far down the track that someone
[40:25] actually can compiled what we call the
[40:27] bible
[40:28] so what did the believers do
[40:31] you know it was more than just them and
[40:34] and i'm all for this i have myself
[40:35] printed thousands of message books and
[40:37] sent them to places and given bibles and
[40:39] everything but it was more than just the
[40:41] believers the new converts being given a
[40:43] message book
[40:44] they had to have someone in them
[40:47] to make that word live
[40:49] as as brother branham would say you know
[40:51] he would say you know
[40:53] and he is recounting billy graham where
[40:54] billy graham would rebuke ministers
[40:56] saying you bunch of lazy preachers you
[40:58] know i come into the city and 30 000
[41:00] people give their lives to christ and
[41:02] you know but i come back and there's not
[41:04] even 30. and he says it's you lazy
[41:06] preachers because you know instead of
[41:08] you going out and seeing how the people
[41:10] were and trying to disciple them and
[41:12] bring them in and you know
[41:14] it's your fault and brother ram said you
[41:16] know billy i admire what you're saying
[41:18] but the thing is what did the apostle
[41:20] paul do because he went into a city met
[41:23] some people maybe met one person and
[41:25] their and their souls got lit by the
[41:27] holy ghost they came back a year later
[41:29] there was 30 from that one
[41:32] amen why because you could say they came
[41:34] in contact with the absolute
[41:36] which is our lord jesus christ himself
[41:39] and that same one that david met where
[41:41] god was became it was him and god
[41:44] that's it that's got to be the same way
[41:47] for us
[41:48] amen brother brahm says in the message
[41:50] um absolute 1962 this is this is uh this
[41:54] is the 30th of december so the next day
[41:56] he preaches is this the time of the end
[41:58] sirs
[41:59] and anyway he says gracious father so so
[42:02] this is in prayer at the end of the
[42:03] message gracious father i know that
[42:05] sometime we must part it's got to be a
[42:08] time that when we're going to leave this
[42:10] world we don't know what time that is
[42:13] it doesn't make too much difference if
[42:15] our time is finished then we want to
[42:18] come our objective of staying here is to
[42:20] serve you
[42:22] and since on the road
[42:24] to destructions one day as paul was on
[42:26] the road to damascus and made havoc of
[42:29] the church uh light blinded him and oh
[42:32] god that light followed him for it was
[42:34] christ and he anchored there to an
[42:36] absolute that even death itself he could
[42:39] laugh in the face of it and say thanks
[42:41] be to god who gives us the victory
[42:43] through jesus christ you become a
[42:46] complete absolute to that apostle
[42:49] amen you were the amen to him the amen
[42:52] is the final say
[42:54] right you were the amen to him in every
[42:56] sentence you were the star of his life
[42:58] the guidepost you were the compass that
[43:02] guided him through the storm
[43:04] you were the revelation you were the
[43:06] vision you were his hopes his salvation
[43:09] even at the hour of death when he knowed
[43:12] he was going to it you were still his
[43:15] absolute you were daniel's absolute you
[43:17] were all the prophets absolute in the
[43:19] midst of the denominational difference
[43:21] and the trouble of their days and the
[43:23] pharisees and sadducees still there was
[43:25] a man who took you for their absolute
[43:28] and today lord men and women with
[43:30] compassion with love and hearts that are
[43:33] bleeding lord for a real experience of
[43:35] knowing god and to have an assurance of
[43:37] an absolute maybe all the people ever
[43:39] know before lord was to join church and
[43:42] we realized as i've tried to sincerely
[43:45] not to be different i you know my heart
[43:47] but tell them that you cannot join the
[43:49] church
[43:50] you join the lodge the methodist the
[43:52] baptist catholic and pentecostal lodges
[43:54] and i could say you could join the
[43:56] shekinah tabernacle lodge you don't want
[43:58] it there's no joining papers in this
[44:00] place
[44:01] you want to say you want to join
[44:03] you'll probably have some intense
[44:05] fellowship with a couple of deacons
[44:07] you know there's nowhere to join here
[44:09] there's nowhere to join we're not
[44:11] joiners
[44:12] amen
[44:13] amen you cannot join you see you join
[44:16] the lot right um but you're born into
[44:18] the church the mystical body of christ
[44:20] and become members of his body with the
[44:22] gifts of the spirit to make his great
[44:24] body move in action and power god that's
[44:26] what these hands meant this morning when
[44:28] they went up place me o lord take me
[44:30] mold me make me just make my position in
[44:33] life such an absolute tied to christ
[44:36] that i'll think of nothing else but that
[44:38] absolute grounded lord bless them heal
[44:40] the sick and the inflicted save the lost
[44:43] so he said that the apostle paul became
[44:46] tied to the absolute on the road to
[44:48] damascus and that was his revelation
[44:51] that was the vision that was his hopes
[44:52] of salvation everything was him
[44:55] amen and that has to be the same thing
[44:57] with you and i now i'm not saying it's
[44:58] not but you've got to realize i've got
[45:01] an absolute i've got a final you know
[45:03] what brother ram say the umpire in a
[45:05] game and it doesn't matter how how they
[45:08] can you know do the replays and do all
[45:09] the stuff you know that man or woman on
[45:11] the field who's the umpire they have the
[45:13] final say it's out it's out it's in it's
[45:15] in it's a foul it's a you know no ball
[45:18] knock-on whatever it is you know they
[45:20] have the final say and it doesn't matter
[45:22] what the armchair critics say that are
[45:24] watching or you know they talk about in
[45:25] the post-game commentary that means
[45:27] nothing it's what happens on the field
[45:30] and what the absolute the umpire says
[45:32] that's what stands
[45:34] right so it's the same thing with you
[45:35] and i it's what our absolute says i mean
[45:38] what declares to us that which is his
[45:40] word that's what matters it's not the
[45:42] armchair critic or the keyboard warrior
[45:44] or you know the people have all the
[45:46] different kind of opinions it's not even
[45:48] our opinion that matters it's god's word
[45:50] that we should stick to because he is
[45:52] our absolute
[45:54] amen but that absolute has to be in us
[45:58] and i'll say what your absolute is as
[46:00] you become
[46:02] you will become like your absolute if
[46:04] you're absolute as some social media
[46:06] queen you'll become like that person or
[46:08] king or whatever they are there's so
[46:10] many different ones you know
[46:12] but if you know and even you your own
[46:14] self could become your absolute
[46:16] your own self-pity
[46:18] you know people become unthankful and
[46:21] they can't receive things in love that
[46:22] it was given them because it's not given
[46:24] in the way they thought it should be
[46:25] given and so they rejected they turn it
[46:27] down what's happened is actually their
[46:28] own self-pity their own pride becomes
[46:30] their absolute because they're becoming
[46:32] like that pride they're manifesting
[46:34] their absolute the apostle paul
[46:36] manifested his absolute
[46:38] amen
[46:39] right so you become whatever your
[46:41] absolute is tonight you will become
[46:45] or you have become you are becoming
[46:47] right so i trust that you can look back
[46:49] in your life and say once upon a time my
[46:51] absolute was a lot of things my absolute
[46:53] once upon a time was a lot of things
[46:56] once upon a time
[46:57] my absolute was danny morrison
[47:00] some people don't know who that is
[47:02] by the younger generations he was a fast
[47:04] bowler in the black what i didn't even
[47:05] know it was called the black cats back
[47:06] then but anyway
[47:08] i wanted to bowl like him i practice it
[47:10] i you know he was my absolute
[47:12] and then there's some other sports style
[47:14] just kind of shifted shift and shifted
[47:16] but then one day
[47:17] i met the real absolute the lord jesus
[47:19] christ
[47:20] and then it doesn't matter what comes
[47:22] around and you know no i've got an
[47:23] absolute and this one works this one's
[47:25] satisfying this one actually is real
[47:28] hallelujah and he transforms you from
[47:30] glory to glory i mean so whatever your
[47:33] absolute is you know this church could
[47:35] become your absolute god forbid god
[47:38] forbid
[47:39] you know shekinah tabernacle is your
[47:41] absolute
[47:42] you know brother abraham says you know
[47:44] he says he says i think we're not really
[47:46] getting the people to christ
[47:48] maybe i'm just you know if i'm repeating
[47:50] a lot of things that brother john andy
[47:52] said forgive me but it just kind of
[47:53] anchored into my heart
[47:55] right but we're going to get the people
[47:56] to the lord to the absolute you know
[47:58] because if you're absolute as the lord
[48:00] then if i if i backslide and i quit your
[48:04] whole family quits the whole church
[48:05] quits if he's really absolute you'll
[48:07] continue on amen sure you won't have
[48:10] sorrow and trouble you know we're not
[48:11] exempt from those things but you'll
[48:12] still serve god
[48:14] amen
[48:15] and that's how we want to be though if
[48:17] the whole world
[48:19] say there's no no such a thing as god
[48:21] everyone just becomes an atheist if you
[48:22] really have the absolute or if they just
[48:25] become religious if you really have the
[48:26] absolute lord jesus christ inside you
[48:28] you'll continue on
[48:30] and that's how we want to be
[48:32] amen we you know we need him to be our
[48:35] absolute illness in this in this age of
[48:38] voices and opinions and and experts and
[48:43] whatever hashtags going
[48:45] let the hashtags go who cares about
[48:47] hashtags you know someone said i can't
[48:50] remember who said it but they quoted c.s
[48:51] lewis and he said in order to go
[48:54] somewhere you have to leave somewhere
[48:57] which makes sense so in order to come to
[48:59] church i had to leave my home
[49:02] that's not rocket science but
[49:03] if something is holding you back
[49:06] from more of the lord you need to leave
[49:08] it
[49:09] you need to leave that thing if it's
[49:11] unforgiveness if it's some little thing
[49:13] you do in the dark you know something
[49:15] that's caught your affections you need
[49:17] to leave that in order to walk on with
[49:19] god
[49:20] right the apostle paul left
[49:23] his phariseeism
[49:24] he left his reputation he left what
[49:27] gamalia thought of him and all the
[49:29] sanhedrin difference he had to leave
[49:30] that he said i counted it all but dung
[49:34] though i may have this absolute
[49:36] hallelujah so he had to leave that in
[49:38] order to gain something
[49:40] amen and we have to be the same kind of
[49:42] way we're gonna be willing to leave
[49:44] things just just let it go
[49:46] let it go
[49:48] chop it free say i'm done with this
[49:49] thing
[49:50] i want more of god who wants more of god
[49:53] there's more to have so it's a good
[49:55] thing
[49:56] hallelujah we haven't even touched the
[49:57] sides of the you know
[49:59] i just feel like you know i don't know
[50:01] what the biggest like you know you
[50:02] brothers were at that market thing in
[50:04] china you're the all the expo thing i
[50:06] feel like with god we've just literally
[50:08] walked in the front door and and and
[50:09] seen the first kiosk
[50:11] there's so much more of his word to
[50:13] enjoy and experience and to you know so
[50:16] let's not just stop here let's keep
[50:17] walking
[50:18] but if you walk through the front door
[50:20] you've got to leave the front door and
[50:21] keep walking it's still all of god's
[50:23] you're not leaving god to get more of
[50:25] god but you know there's more to have
[50:28] so
[50:28] we don't want to
[50:30] hold on to things that's why the apostle
[50:32] paul would say lay aside every weight
[50:34] and sin that does so easily beside us
[50:36] let's run the race so you've got to
[50:37] leave the weights and the sins
[50:39] to walk on or to run on
[50:42] rather
[50:44] amen
[50:46] so he had an absolute now
[50:48] you can see all the real believers down
[50:50] through the scripture
[50:52] met that same absolute
[50:55] and they didn't care what public opinion
[50:57] said or what the other believers were
[50:58] doing
[50:59] they were determined
[51:02] that they would
[51:03] walk with that absolute it sounds like
[51:05] i'm in a mix of a
[51:07] toilet and a shower and a subway pipe
[51:09] all at the same time up here i don't
[51:10] know what's going on
[51:13] not that i've been in such a place
[51:14] anyway but it sounds real funny up here
[51:18] now caleb and joshua
[51:20] were two of the twelve spies that went
[51:22] into canaan
[51:24] they heard the same preaching moses they
[51:27] all of those spies heard the same
[51:28] preaching from moses they saw all the
[51:30] same miracles they saw they they were in
[51:32] the miracle they walked through the red
[51:34] sea they experienced it you know it
[51:36] wasn't just a you know something they
[51:38] heard
[51:39] they
[51:40] they they heard the screams of the
[51:41] egyptians on the night of the passover
[51:44] you know they experienced all that but
[51:47] their absolute was different to the
[51:49] other 10 spies
[51:50] because the other 10 spies as absolute
[51:53] was based on what they could see with
[51:55] the five senses
[51:56] and that shifts
[51:58] you know who
[51:59] who's woken up and felt grumpy
[52:03] who's woken up and felt happy
[52:06] who's woken up and said i needed about
[52:07] five coffees at least and i can start
[52:09] functioning
[52:11] so
[52:13] so your five senses i mean how you feel
[52:15] goes up and down it changes like the
[52:17] weather
[52:19] right on steroids it changes
[52:22] but that's not an absolute that's a
[52:24] shifting absolute
[52:26] right so the other 10 spies they're
[52:28] absolute shifted
[52:31] that sure it was easy when when when
[52:33] moses was doing everything
[52:35] but then they had to actually testify of
[52:38] what they believed
[52:39] and because the absolute wasn't in them
[52:42] because it says even even in numbers god
[52:44] says that there's a there was a there's
[52:46] a different spirit with caleb and joshua
[52:48] which was the holy ghost right so they
[52:50] had an absolute like the apostle paul
[52:52] and if you really have the absolute of
[52:54] the word then whatever the promise of
[52:56] the word is for you you'll say that's my
[52:59] that's mine
[53:00] i'm gonna take it because you're titan
[53:02] because the absolute in you which is the
[53:04] lord wants to fulfill
[53:06] the promise of your day
[53:08] irrespective of obstacle trouble trial
[53:11] within without
[53:13] those things don't come into it
[53:15] you're tied to an absolute
[53:17] he following me right tied to an
[53:18] absolute so the other spies there
[53:21] absolute wasn't faith like caleb and
[53:24] joshua and they told the people they all
[53:26] saw the same land but they said there's
[53:29] giants they've got big walled cities
[53:30] where grasshoppers in their site and as
[53:32] i've said before i doubt very much they
[53:35] kind of
[53:36] phil took a survey for him and asked
[53:38] some questions do we look like
[53:40] grasshoppers what do we look like in
[53:41] your site a normal size b big c
[53:44] grasshopper d all of the above you know
[53:46] it was just something that they worked
[53:47] out in their mind
[53:49] we're like grasshoppers on their site
[53:51] well
[53:52] you know but the thing is because their
[53:54] absolute wasn't the absolute even though
[53:56] they would have said sure we're
[53:57] circumcised jews we believe in jehovah
[54:00] look moses is our prophet we believe the
[54:01] message of the hour but the absolute
[54:04] wasn't in them
[54:06] but caleb and joshua they saw the same
[54:07] people they saw the same cities they saw
[54:09] the same trouble they said let's just go
[54:11] take it now
[54:13] why because the absolute was in them
[54:16] hallelujah so they didn't look at
[54:19] circumstance they just looked at the
[54:20] promise
[54:22] and i'll say it was the absolute
[54:24] oh you're following me because that was
[54:26] anchored in them
[54:28] what they saw didn't matter it was the
[54:29] promise that mattered
[54:32] amen
[54:33] now brother braham says in the power of
[54:35] god
[54:36] he's talking about a boy flying a kite
[54:39] you know because storms come and go
[54:40] don't they
[54:41] i say the state of your mental alertness
[54:44] varies very much when you wake up you
[54:46] can have a good day a bad day a horrible
[54:48] day a terrible day you know there's a
[54:49] lot of different days you can have but
[54:52] if if you're tied to the absolute it
[54:55] doesn't matter how stormy life gets or
[54:57] how much trouble you can be pitched
[54:59] upside down in a free fall but if you're
[55:01] tied to that absolute
[55:02] amen it's something that is unmovable
[55:06] in our lives
[55:08] he's talking about a boy flying a kite
[55:10] he says we have an anchor amen that's in
[55:12] the veil like the scripture says we're
[55:14] anchored within the veil
[55:16] that's someone who's tied to the
[55:17] absolute that the absolute's in them
[55:18] there's a tie that cannot be
[55:21] broken
[55:22] we can't see it sometimes but we know
[55:25] it's there
[55:26] like the little boy was flying the kite
[55:28] they said where's it at
[55:29] said i can't see it said i know it's
[55:32] still there because i can feel it so
[55:34] this kiter went up into the clouds and
[55:36] he didn't know where it was but he still
[55:37] still felt the tension on the line
[55:39] hallelujah it wasn't just flapping in
[55:40] the breeze he knew it was there but why
[55:42] could he say that but the others
[55:44] couldn't because he's feeling a pull
[55:46] i mean he's feeling a tug i mean i feel
[55:48] the pull of the hour
[55:50] i mean but the others are just
[55:51] spectators but i don't think i'm looking
[55:53] at spectators i think i'm i'm looking at
[55:56] kite flyers
[55:58] oh look at that anchored beyond the veil
[56:01] i don't mean that as a joke but you know
[56:02] what i mean he says here so that's right
[56:04] we may not be able to see it times get
[56:06] dark the clouds may hide his blessed
[56:08] face for a spell remember the clouds may
[56:10] hide his face but it don't hide him it
[56:13] can hide the sun from you but it's still
[56:15] shining beyond the clouds and faith sees
[56:17] the sun beyond the cloud and here was
[56:20] moses mother in the conflict of testing
[56:22] of her faith and every child every son
[56:24] that cometh to god first must be tried
[56:26] god test your faith now look like god
[56:29] would just simply bypass the whole thing
[56:31] and
[56:32] and don't have
[56:34] any appropriate away and just cut the
[56:36] thing off but it's better that he gives
[56:37] you a test and then comes to you when
[56:40] you're in the test i like that don't you
[56:42] the well he comes to you in the test he
[56:45] said i'm going through a trial he wants
[56:46] to meet you in that trial where'd he
[56:48] meet the three hebrew boys in the fire
[56:50] not before the fire and the fire
[56:53] hallelujah so it's good to be in the
[56:55] fire now i
[56:57] um i like that don't you the greatest
[56:59] experience of my life is when i come up
[57:01] against the mountain i can't get over it
[57:03] under it or around it and and just stand
[57:05] still and god will move the thing back
[57:07] he will move no matter how dark the
[57:09] cloud is faith passes it yonder with an
[57:11] eye that looks beyond anything that the
[57:13] devil can set before you because god is
[57:16] our victory amen
[57:18] hallelujah
[57:21] amen
[57:23] now
[57:25] um this is from the this is from the um
[57:28] piece that was
[57:29] printed in the full gospel businessmen's
[57:31] um
[57:32] magazine where they printed the whole
[57:35] account of brother brown talking about
[57:36] going beyond the curtain of time
[57:38] and and this is just a portion of it
[57:40] this is the end of it he says whatever
[57:42] you do
[57:43] lay aside everything else until you get
[57:45] perfect love that we know perfect love
[57:47] is the holy ghost right it's not like
[57:49] you get the holy ghost then you're gonna
[57:50] get perfect love he is perfect love
[57:52] right so
[57:56] get to where you can love everybody even
[57:58] every enemy
[58:00] he says no matter if the plane is
[58:02] rocking the lightning's flashing or the
[58:04] guns of the enemy are upon you
[58:07] these things do not matter
[58:09] get perfect love
[58:10] so you're saying it doesn't matter what
[58:12] the state you're in or the circumstances
[58:14] who's been in a plane where it's rocking
[58:16] and pitching and you know
[58:19] first time with brother adrian to
[58:20] vanuatu there was a big storm and we
[58:22] were landing on a island with a you know
[58:25] dirt runway and it was so wet we skidded
[58:27] off it and the and the road has started
[58:28] cutting the long grass
[58:30] we're fine but you know you know we've
[58:32] had stuff like that going but it doesn't
[58:33] matter what's going on right if you have
[58:36] the lord those things don't matter amen
[58:40] you say but it's very real no no your
[58:41] absolute is more real than the
[58:43] circumstance because circumstances come
[58:45] and go troubles come and go but the
[58:47] absolute the lord jesus christ abideth
[58:49] forever
[58:51] hallelujah so he says these things do
[58:53] not matter now
[58:55] we could you'd say but but they do
[58:57] matter i'm going through something but
[58:59] relative to him
[59:01] relative to him living you're tied to
[59:03] the absolute they don't matter
[59:07] amen he says if you're not saved except
[59:10] jesus christ is your savior now
[59:12] if you have not been baptized in water
[59:14] be baptized now if you have not received
[59:16] the baptism in the holy spirit receive
[59:17] it now press on to that perfect love
[59:20] which will take you to that beautiful
[59:22] and joyful place beyond the curtain of
[59:24] time
[59:26] hallelujah
[59:28] amen and one account where he gives that
[59:31] uh he's singing at the end
[59:34] and and there's a song let us look past
[59:36] the curtain of time and he says lord let
[59:39] them look past the curtain of time
[59:41] wouldn't that help
[59:43] so well
[59:44] wouldn't it help you say well what is it
[59:46] when you feel the brush of angel's wings
[59:48] brother says you feel that real sweet
[59:50] humble feeling come upon he says that's
[59:52] that's angels coming around you that's
[59:54] the lord coming around you what is that
[59:56] that is actually the effects of beyond
[59:58] the curtain of time
[59:59] that's the land beyond the river drawing
[1:00:01] near
[1:00:02] to let you know you belong on that side
[1:00:04] you don't belong here you belong up
[1:00:06] there
[1:00:07] that's why you just you know he's such a
[1:00:09] presence his presence comes around you
[1:00:11] may be in prayer driving in the car
[1:00:13] washing dishes you may be at work you
[1:00:14] may be at school wherever you may be and
[1:00:16] then he drills near
[1:00:18] what is that that's him beyond the
[1:00:19] curtain reaching out
[1:00:22] hallelujah and in those moments you
[1:00:24] realize nothing really matters
[1:00:26] nothing else really matters i've got a
[1:00:28] home in glory land that outshines the
[1:00:30] sun
[1:00:31] amen and he wants you to to to realize
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:36] this life may be shifting sands
[1:00:38] but he is not
[1:00:40] and if you're tied to that absolute like
[1:00:42] the apostle paul he had good days he had
[1:00:45] bad days and he lists off a whole bunch
[1:00:46] of bad days that we've never i've never
[1:00:48] been shipwrecked i've never been beaten
[1:00:50] i've never been stoned i never had to
[1:00:52] run for my life you know
[1:00:55] i've never had who's had anyone
[1:00:58] you know he had a lot of but he was tied
[1:01:00] to an absolute the absolute the lord
[1:01:02] jesus christ and that same absolute i
[1:01:04] trust is your absolute that he is your
[1:01:06] absolute
[1:01:08] hallelujah amen so that you don't we
[1:01:11] don't worship god through another person
[1:01:14] now what do you mean by that well your
[1:01:16] relationship with god if you're
[1:01:18] worshiping god through another person
[1:01:20] then how they they are doing dictates to
[1:01:23] you how your relationship with god is
[1:01:25] doing
[1:01:26] so if they're up you're up
[1:01:29] if they're down you're down
[1:01:32] if they do something that's absolutely
[1:01:33] sideways it just throws you
[1:01:37] right and sure these things
[1:01:39] will throw will will will throw us
[1:01:42] but if you're tied to the absolute it
[1:01:44] won't throw you all the way down
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:49] so are you worshiping god through your
[1:01:51] parents through your brother your sister
[1:01:52] your mum or dad
[1:01:54] you know that if they're up you're up oh
[1:01:56] god's real because look at my parents
[1:01:58] you know or my brother or the pastor or
[1:02:00] the deacons or whatever you know god's
[1:02:01] real cause of them but
[1:02:03] what if they fall
[1:02:06] what's going to happen to you
[1:02:07] and your walk
[1:02:09] see if you're tied to the absolute
[1:02:11] doesn't matter what happens to them
[1:02:13] you'll keep walking on
[1:02:16] amen i trust i trust that we're not
[1:02:18] serving god through someone else
[1:02:20] we're not serving god because of this
[1:02:22] church or serving god through this
[1:02:24] church brother and says the greatest
[1:02:26] deception the world's ever faced is
[1:02:27] right now because people are thinking
[1:02:29] they're worshiping god through a church
[1:02:31] through a system
[1:02:33] but they're not
[1:02:34] amen but i'm glad that he is our
[1:02:37] absolute
[1:02:39] amen is he your absolute tonight
[1:02:41] hallelujah that
[1:02:43] it don't matter what happens
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:47] he's our god and he's going to see us
[1:02:49] through
[1:02:50] the apostle paul would say in ephesians
[1:02:52] 4
[1:02:54] this i say therefore and testify in the
[1:02:56] lord that he henceforth walk not as
[1:02:57] other gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:02:59] their mind
[1:03:01] having the the understanding darkened
[1:03:03] being alienated from the life of god
[1:03:04] through the ignorance that is in them
[1:03:06] because of the blindness of their heart
[1:03:08] who being past feeling have given
[1:03:11] themselves over unto lasciviousness to
[1:03:14] walk to work all uncleanness with
[1:03:16] greediness
[1:03:18] but ye have not so learned christ
[1:03:21] you haven't learned him
[1:03:22] it hasn't been a school to you it hasn't
[1:03:24] been a textbook it hasn't been a theory
[1:03:27] test it hasn't been a seven steps to
[1:03:29] becoming a believer this is not how
[1:03:31] you've you know you have not so learned
[1:03:33] christ
[1:03:34] but
[1:03:34] so so what he's saying is that the
[1:03:36] absolute you've met the absolute
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:41] if so be that ye have heard him not
[1:03:44] heard of him there's a big chasm between
[1:03:47] hearing of him and hearing him
[1:03:50] amen when you really hear his voice and
[1:03:52] he speaks to you directly calls you
[1:03:54] something grips your heart that's
[1:03:55] hearing him
[1:03:57] amen and the voice of god is in the
[1:03:58] bride of christ where is god people say
[1:04:00] he's in his people amen sure he's in his
[1:04:02] word but the words and the people is the
[1:04:04] gods and the people
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:07] so if so that ye have heard him
[1:04:10] and have been taught by him not been
[1:04:13] taught of him but been taught by him so
[1:04:16] he's the inside teacher the spirit of
[1:04:18] truth when he comes he will he will lead
[1:04:20] you into all truth
[1:04:23] amen so it does not say that you have
[1:04:24] heard of him and that have been taught
[1:04:26] of him
[1:04:28] no that ye have heard him he's called
[1:04:29] who's caught has he called you
[1:04:32] amen amen he called david and david said
[1:04:34] he's my god my salvation my buckler my
[1:04:37] shield my high tower i mean when i cried
[1:04:40] with my voice he heard my prayer
[1:04:42] hallelujah
[1:04:44] amen see there's no nothing between the
[1:04:46] believer in god
[1:04:49] the blood
[1:04:50] has annihilated every wall of partition
[1:04:53] there's no chasm no more he just filled
[1:04:55] it in
[1:04:56] hallelujah
[1:04:57] amen
[1:04:58] now
[1:05:00] as the truth is in jesus that ye put off
[1:05:02] concerning the former conversation the
[1:05:04] old man which is corrupt according to
[1:05:06] the deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[1:05:09] spirit of your mind and that you put on
[1:05:11] the new man which after god is created
[1:05:13] in righteousness and true holiness
[1:05:16] wherefore putting away lying speak every
[1:05:19] man truth with his neighbor for we are
[1:05:21] members one of another be anger and sin
[1:05:24] not let not the sun go down upon your
[1:05:26] wrath neither give place to the devil
[1:05:28] let him that stole steal no more but
[1:05:31] rather let him labor working with his
[1:05:33] hands the thing which is good and that
[1:05:34] he may have to give to him that needeth
[1:05:37] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:05:40] of your mouth
[1:05:41] but that which is good to the use of
[1:05:43] edifying that it may minister grace into
[1:05:45] the hearers and grieve not the holy
[1:05:47] spirit of god whereby you're sealed into
[1:05:50] the day of redemption don't grieve the
[1:05:53] absolute
[1:05:54] amen we want to live a life that pleases
[1:05:56] him
[1:05:57] not that we're trying to earn salvation
[1:05:59] we know we
[1:06:01] we can't do that eh
[1:06:03] people do because because people think
[1:06:05] it's man's effort can get them to heaven
[1:06:06] no it's one man's achievement
[1:06:09] that gets us to heaven the man christ
[1:06:11] jesus
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:13] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:06:15] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:06:17] from you with all malice and be kind one
[1:06:19] to another tender hearted forgiving one
[1:06:21] another even as god for christ's sake
[1:06:24] hath
[1:06:25] forgiven you
[1:06:27] hallelujah
[1:06:29] amen i'm just going to read one more um
[1:06:33] i'm gonna read one more quote
[1:06:36] and then we're gonna pray but i trust is
[1:06:38] he your absolute is he your everything
[1:06:40] is he the finals is he the first say and
[1:06:43] the final say in your life
[1:06:45] amen he says now
[1:06:48] now this is how powerful the word of god
[1:06:49] is
[1:06:50] and you and i
[1:06:52] he said now this isn't the conflict
[1:06:54] between god and satan he says but god at
[1:06:56] the beginning gave his children the
[1:06:58] atomic weapon because he's the infinite
[1:07:01] god now seeing that there was going to
[1:07:02] be a conflict and there was going to be
[1:07:04] a battle god equipped his children with
[1:07:07] the right kind of ammunition the right
[1:07:09] kind of an attack the right kind of
[1:07:11] everything that they had need of that
[1:07:14] would sweep them all the way from eden
[1:07:16] to the rapture
[1:07:17] hallelujah what was it the word the word
[1:07:20] that's what defeat satan is the word now
[1:07:23] when i say the word i'm not
[1:07:25] it's when this becomes alive in you
[1:07:28] right because he is the word he's a
[1:07:29] person
[1:07:31] i mean so so if he is in you
[1:07:33] amen that that word will overcome satan
[1:07:37] battles come in your mind
[1:07:39] what happens the lord is the soldier on
[1:07:41] the battlefield
[1:07:43] right whole bunch of things he tossed
[1:07:44] two and three throw in your mind but if
[1:07:46] you really just surrender it to the lord
[1:07:48] he'll he'll he'll come on the scene
[1:07:51] change your thinking show up for what it
[1:07:52] is
[1:07:53] defeat that
[1:07:54] devil amen
[1:07:59] amen uh what is it the word the word
[1:08:01] that's what defeat satan is the word
[1:08:03] it'll defeat him anywhere any place now
[1:08:05] why do we want to substitute something
[1:08:07] else when we've already got the best
[1:08:09] thing there is the word and we find
[1:08:12] jesus on earth just to prove his this
[1:08:14] was the best equipment when satan come
[1:08:17] in hand-to-hand combat with jesus he
[1:08:19] never just reached over with his power
[1:08:20] and tied his hands he just took the same
[1:08:22] weapon that god gave in the garden of
[1:08:24] eden his word and said it's written it's
