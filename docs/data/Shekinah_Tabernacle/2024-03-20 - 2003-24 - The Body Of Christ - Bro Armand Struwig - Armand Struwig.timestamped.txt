[32:28] together tonight and say father tonight
[32:32] Lord may you just go to tuni Lord Jesus
[32:34] and touch that fever and may it leave in
[32:36] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ

[33:14] already discern everything that was in
[33:16] their heart before they even got there
[33:18] father that same God Is With Us Now
[33:20] father and every request spoken or
[33:23] unspoken Lord we ask Lord to lay it at
[33:25] your feet and say father you just go and
[33:27] you win the Battle For Your Glory and
[33:30] your kingdom we pray in the name of our
[33:32] Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God
[33:36] bless you Saints let's go there to Mark
[33:39] 16 I'm going to start the timer cuz man
[33:42] always need a
[33:45] timer
[33:47] Hallelujah so the bride's
[33:51] commission so what triggered this
[33:53] thought is it's great to know that we're
[33:55] the bride and we always speak about
[33:58] ourselves as being the bride of Christ
[34:00] and that's fantastic but what does it
[34:02] mean to be the bride of Christ you know
[34:06] where do we go you know what do we do we
[34:08] you know a lot of Christians they all
[34:10] love God they they all love God
[34:12] everybody that that proclaims the name
[34:13] of Jesus loves God but what is the
[34:15] bride's commission what is what are we
[34:18] supposed to fulfill in this day and it's
[34:20] a good question because if we know this
[34:22] we know where we stand and we know what
[34:25] we need to do with our first next couple
[34:26] of steps am so this is not me I was
[34:30] jumping for joy in my house today I was
[34:31] going through these notes hey and I had
[34:33] a jubilee I was man if you ever heard me
[34:36] shout that was
[34:37] today cuz sometimes God just has to wake
[34:40] you up and show you who you really are
[34:43] now I'm not saying anything else at what
[34:45] brother brandham said all I'm going to
[34:46] say is what the scriptures and what
[34:48] brother brandham showed us who we are
[34:49] that's it there's nothing fancy to it
[34:52] this is actually your true identity okay
[34:54] and if you can realize who you are then
[34:57] just in that because then you have
[34:59] dominion over every devil I don't want
[35:01] to get ahead of myself but let's go
[35:03] let's see if this one works I might
[35:05] switch it on there you go Mark 16 who's
[35:09] there say amen amen man you guys are
[35:12] fast I'm not even there
[35:14] yet I'm inan Matthew let's try that
[35:17] again okay so if we go there from verse
[35:21] 14 and verse 14 Jesus comes to the 11 so
[35:25] this is after he was crucified and after
[35:27] he showed himself to Mary he now comes
[35:30] to the 11 and they they there and
[35:32] waiting upon him and it says afterward
[35:35] he appeared unto the 11 please follow in
[35:37] your word I didn't put the scriptures up
[35:39] because it's time we we read and see it
[35:42] for ourselves handle this word for
[35:43] ourselves if you don't have your Bible
[35:46] next time bring it after he appeared
[35:48] unto the 11 as they sat at meat he up
[35:52] braided them with their unbelief and
[35:54] Hardness of Heart he gave them a makulu
[36:00] Jimmy he was very angry when he got
[36:02] there he actually corrected them and he
[36:05] says your hearts are hard and you've got
[36:08] unbelief because all this time I was
[36:10] with you and now still now you guys down
[36:13] wow and you have all these fluster and
[36:15] all these what's going on but here Jesus
[36:18] comes and he just sets it an on and he
[36:20] goes your
[36:21] unbelief and who you really are and what
[36:25] price I paid for you to be in this
[36:26] position TR amen may it never be
[36:30] us he says the hardness of your heart
[36:34] because they believe not them which had
[36:36] seen him after he was risen not that
[36:40] report how many times have we spoken
[36:44] about that Malachi F Prophet that needs
[36:46] to come people don't believe it God has
[36:49] the same yesterday today and forever
[36:52] people don't believe it days of Miracles
[36:54] Never End people don't believe it but
[36:57] has has it been preached time and time
[36:59] and time again it's like it's like the
[37:01] foundation of the message but people
[37:03] keep seem to just skim over
[37:05] it and Jesus is correcting these
[37:08] disciples and say hey there's greater
[37:10] things going on and the report that you
[37:12] got you don't believe it and this report
[37:15] is about
[37:17] me amen and then he said to them go ye
[37:20] into the world and preach the gospel to
[37:23] every creature and he that believeth is
[37:26] baptized shall be saved saved amen
[37:29] strange that we always have a fight over
[37:31] baptism when Jesus Christ after the
[37:34] atonement was made said that is the way
[37:36] in that's the first step you have to
[37:38] make is to declare to the world who you
[37:42] following and whose name you taking
[37:45] because he says there he says he that
[37:47] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[37:50] and he that believeth not shall be
[37:52] damned and these signs shall follow them
[37:54] that believe in my name they shall cast
[37:57] out death
[38:02] that's
[38:03] right in whose name in my name they
[38:07] shall cast out devils and they shall
[38:09] speak with new tongues and they shall
[38:11] take up serpents and they shall D dread
[38:14] drink any deadly thing and it shall not
[38:16] hurt them and they shall lay their hands
[38:18] upon the sick and they shall recover
[38:21] amen amen May the word the Lord add to
[38:24] his word let's just bow our heads
[38:26] quickly Lord Jesus we have opened this
[38:28] word now and we love you Lord but we
[38:30] need the author to step right in now
[38:32] father and take this service and Lord
[38:35] may you just sinking in so deep father
[38:37] tonight that we know that we know that
[38:39] you are in control Lord and we just say
[38:41] Lord come come Lord and Minister unto
[38:44] your bride we ask in the name of our
[38:46] Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen you may
[38:49] be seated
[38:52] hallelujah amen 34 minutes
[38:56] left I have to or else you know me I'll
[38:59] just go all night brother Andy I'm like
[39:01] you
[39:03] hey but if you knew where we came from
[39:06] amen and you knew where we used to dwell
[39:09] then we would get a chance to speak
[39:11] about Jesus oh boy please you know it's
[39:14] like it it's nervous yet exciting
[39:17] because you always feel the two forces
[39:19] right here in church connecting they're
[39:21] always bashing heads the one wants to
[39:23] keep you out of service and the one
[39:25] wants to draw you closer to him yeah and
[39:27] just which one is going to win tonight
[39:30] children which one is going to win
[39:32] tonight hallelujah amen so we
[39:35] know oh I just lost my place here give
[39:38] me a
[39:40] sec so I want to go to something there
[39:43] which I read earlier on and it and it or
[39:46] didn't read but I wanted to read it it's
[39:48] John
[39:50] 3:15 and um I didn't read it because I
[39:52] thought I wouldn't but it kind of is
[39:54] good for us to go there so John
[39:58] 3:15 now remember Jesus just told the
[40:01] disciples the power that they have in
[40:03] his
[40:04] name and see when we look at
[40:07] denominations and we look at the world
[40:10] they all believe the same scriptures
[40:12] they believe that yeah and they also
[40:15] believe John 3:16 yeah they do believe
[40:18] it God so loved the world that He Sent
[40:20] His only begotten son they believe it
[40:22] but there's something I read and it and
[40:24] it just hit me inside and I thought man
[40:27] maybe if I could just explain it to you
[40:30] how the Lord showed it to me so um John
[40:32] 3 and we'll start there from verse 15 he
[40:35] says and whosoever believeth in him
[40:38] should not perish but have eternal life
[40:40] for God so loved the world that he gave
[40:42] his only begotten son that whosoever
[40:44] liveth in him should not perish
[40:46] believeth in him should not perish but
[40:48] have everlasting life for God has sent
[40:52] his son not into the world to condemn
[40:55] the world but the world through him
[40:58] might be saved we believe it but see we
[41:02] don't only believe that we believe Mark
[41:06] 16 there has to be something come with
[41:08] it amen because if and and brother Ben
[41:11] preached it so many times and and I
[41:13] wonder if it kind of sinks in sometimes
[41:15] it says Grace if you really have
[41:18] received Grace it's the Divine influence
[41:20] upon the heart and the reflection in the
[41:22] life so it's no works anymore it's just
[41:26] you reflecting Christ
[41:28] and whatever he puts on you you just
[41:30] reflect it back because you love him so
[41:32] so you're not trying to work yourself up
[41:35] to go do works for God it's those things
[41:37] are dead because you're going to stand
[41:38] before God and say God I did all this
[41:40] and all this and all this and he goes
[41:41] you never knew me yeah but but the
[41:44] relationship is to between the bride and
[41:46] Christ is a bit more personal than just
[41:48] John 3:16 it's a bit more personal than
[41:52] just the commission to go and preach the
[41:53] gospel it goes further than just those
[41:56] two scriptures
[41:59] yes sir so see Christ is the
[42:02] Cornerstone and that Cornerstone is a
[42:04] foundation so I put up these for the
[42:06] children that's a keystone so that's an
[42:09] arch that they build who knows what that
[42:11] Keystone does it holds together it holds
[42:15] together thank you brother Jonah it
[42:17] holds it together so they build both
[42:20] these stones and when they came come to
[42:21] the last piece they put that Keystone in
[42:24] and then they pull whatever was holding
[42:25] those stones up they go
[42:27] and everything just tightly fits
[42:30] together and it doesn't fall down amen
[42:34] and if you look at a Cornerstone and
[42:36] that building's got one massive
[42:38] Cornerstone look at that thing wow like
[42:41] that's a Cornerstone those guys turn the
[42:43] corner okay like they turn the
[42:46] corner amen but see that building is
[42:50] built upon a foundation stone and if you
[42:53] look at it it says a Cornerstone is a
[42:55] foundation stone um that is the first
[42:59] stone that's set into this
[43:01] construction okay the other stones will
[43:04] be set in reference to the
[43:08] stone so so here we go so there's a
[43:12] Cornerstone that's been preached in our
[43:14] day by Malachi 4 amen
[43:18] amen not not some of
[43:22] it not just that bit no no all of it
[43:28] amen The Good The Bad and The
[43:31] Good the really while it's the bad is
[43:34] sometimes when God is dealing with you
[43:37] and knocking on your door and saying hey
[43:38] what you're busy doing is not right
[43:40] that's the bad amen but see you have two
[43:43] choices you have two choices you can
[43:45] submit yourself to the word of God or
[43:48] you can reject it so you can build
[43:51] yourself upon a foundation where is set
[43:55] and remember Jesus is that stone that
[43:57] the bulus rejected yeah but not just the
[44:00] name of Jesus and the culture of Jesus
[44:03] but the life of Jesus Christ within the
[44:05] believer Hallelujah that's the whole
[44:07] purpose of the Bride Christ wants to
[44:10] come and display himself through the
[44:12] bride to this world cuz they fulfilling
[44:15] the commission that Christ has come they
[44:17] do the Greater Works not bigger but more
[44:20] of it because he's now come and he's he
[44:22] set himself up the day of Pentecost and
[44:25] he and he put himself in 120 so the Holy
[44:27] Spirit came in and more of God was and
[44:29] more of people so more of people can go
[44:32] out to do greater work not greater than
[44:36] Jesus Christ nothing can be greater than
[44:37] Jesus Christ but the work we all do is
[44:40] great am but sometimes we get so caught
[44:42] up in daytoday life that we forget about
[44:45] what our greater work is oh yeah and we
[44:48] go oh it's only by grace and it's not by
[44:50] works and hold
[44:52] on if you say you love me and you don't
[44:56] look me in the eyes and go I love
[44:59] you that's fine but sometimes I need a
[45:03] hug sometimes I need
[45:05] prayer sometimes I need someone just to
[45:08] be there for me God with flesh on yeah
[45:11] the purpose for the bride is not to keep
[45:13] this gospel to herself amen the purpose
[45:16] for the bride is not to believe in
[45:17] miracles and not let it manifest the
[45:20] purpose of the Bride is not to speak in
[45:22] tongues and not have God have
[45:25] preeminence in the service and
[45:26] correcting people people through the
[45:27] gifts see the gifts are important but
[45:30] the giver is more important right we
[45:33] don't major on all those things we need
[45:35] Christ we need the headstone we need the
[45:37] Keystone to our life is Christ and if
[45:39] you don't submit to Christ and the word
[45:42] because remember and I'm way off my
[45:44] notes but I'll tell you this in the
[45:46] beginning was the and the Word was with
[45:50] God
[45:51] and and the Word was God right and this
[45:55] word became manifest it became flesh and
[45:58] it dwelt among us and we beheld the
[46:00] glory and that word was Jesus Christ so
[46:03] we can't say we Believers but we don't
[46:07] believe the
[46:10] word you
[46:12] can't so see the purpose for God is to
[46:15] do this break this seed of discrepancy
[46:19] reasoning you know so when people say
[46:22] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:24] discrepancy comes in when they say serpy
[46:27] discrepancy comes in when anything is
[46:29] that you say and you speak the truth
[46:30] that the word says people that don't
[46:33] want it will always bring doubt and
[46:36] they'll always bring a reasoning to it
[46:38] we don't reason it we believe it amen
[46:41] cuz remember you're the bride of Christ
[46:43] you made different yeah see and this is
[46:45] what you don't understand is you were
[46:47] made different Before Time even began
[46:49] God already knew who you going to be
[46:52] prise the Lord and at least you already
[46:54] knew he knew when you were going to
[46:56] accept him you knew the words you were
[46:58] going to say you know you knew the
[47:00] moment the time down to the second and
[47:03] he can't
[47:04] wait to have that relationship with
[47:07] you but we forget who we
[47:10] are so I want to go on
[47:22] yeah oh that's small but you can read it
[47:25] I'll read it on you
[47:27] Christ was manifested to destroy the
[47:29] works of the devil is that true can I
[47:32] get an amen amen amen so tell me when
[47:35] Jesus Christ was here on Earth did any
[47:38] demon have authority over him no the
[47:43] wind the rain no water anything nothing
[47:47] who was walking on top of the water yeah
[47:49] Jesus come on man do you not see look
[47:53] you think it's just a story but God had
[47:56] so much Dominion that he even put the
[47:59] prophet and said to me you speak to the
[48:02] storm and it will seize
[48:05] amen so why can't you do
[48:09] it can I tell you a testimony it works
[48:13] Amen brother Ben you spoke against the
[48:15] storm amen you just recently shared it
[48:17] with your trip the Solomon Islands one
[48:20] day I was working on a construction site
[48:22] and man it was raining the whole week
[48:25] and I prayed to the Lord I said Lord if
[48:26] it has to rain let it rain your will be
[48:29] done but I ask this if there's any Grace
[48:34] upon your side for me I cannot have
[48:37] another day of rain in here I cannot
[48:41] take another day of rain it's been cold
[48:43] and rainy and I've been working on the
[48:45] road so I might see my heart but Lord I
[48:48] don't care your will be done cuz that's
[48:49] the bride yeah amen still your will be
[48:52] done why am I sick your will be done why
[48:55] is healing taking long it will be done
[48:58] your will be done we still Su the will
[49:00] of the father before we worry about
[49:02] ourselves and I'm going to come to it I
[49:04] don't want to get ahead and we're going
[49:05] to finish this and then I said Lord but
[49:08] let it not rain in the name of our Lord
[49:10] Jesus Christ but I first asked them and
[49:13] I went to work and the guys were
[49:15] scorning and laughing I've told a lot of
[49:17] people this testimony
[49:18] already and I said it's not going to
[49:20] rain today it was raining already but I
[49:22] said it's not going to rain today and
[49:24] the guys laughed at me and the one guy
[49:26] said
[49:27] why would you say that I said because I
[49:30] prayed and he laughed in my face haha
[49:33] you prayed oh M so we went inside the
[49:36] building never forget this and we did
[49:39] saw training how to cut a straight line
[49:41] with a saw still couldn't cut a straight
[49:43] line after that but did that and then we
[49:46] had these roller doors and we were doing
[49:48] was inside the roller doors doing the
[49:50] the the mockup you know practice how to
[49:53] do the blade and all those things is a
[49:55] big road source and then they opened the
[49:57] roller doors and when we walked out from
[50:00] the Middle where we were not from the
[50:02] sides not from the East the West the
[50:03] north the South right in the middle
[50:05] where we were standing the the a hole
[50:08] became like this and just bigger like a
[50:10] donut and bigger and bigger and bigger
[50:12] and before I got to the truck it got
[50:14] bigger and bigger and after that when I
[50:17] got in the truck started truck did
[50:19] everything right the sky started opening
[50:21] up amen I knew I knew what just happened
[50:26] amen
[50:27] they they they said the whole week it
[50:29] was going to rain I knew what happened
[50:31] then and I knew when I asked the Lord
[50:33] that he could do it I just wanted him to
[50:35] know is it in his will yeah so he saw my
[50:38] heart and he saw the intent of my heart
[50:41] and he knew that I was his bride and for
[50:43] him for one second he stopped and he
[50:45] goes if my bride doesn't want it to rain
[50:48] it will not rain today that's the God we
[50:51] serve but we forget what Authority and
[50:54] what terms we have with God amen we
[50:57] forget that he took us out of
[50:59] denomination he took us out of these one
[51:01] verse Bibles and he actually placed us
[51:04] higher with him saying you have
[51:06] authority you can speak you can pray for
[51:10] the sick and they'll be healed we don't
[51:11] believe it because we don't see it every
[51:13] day that don't mean it's not your
[51:15] commission that's so he says here and
[51:18] I'm just going to take a sip of water my
[51:20] mouth so dry and he says Christ is
[51:23] Manifest to destroy the works of the
[51:24] devil is that right the ation says amen
[51:28] he says you all believe
[51:31] that that's why he and that's what was
[51:34] he the word God's word which
[51:38] destroys I'm just going to come back
[51:40] here which destroys the works of that
[51:42] hybrid the devil so we know in the
[51:45] Garden of Eden I'm just going to refresh
[51:46] your memories uh Joshua all you guys
[51:49] that was on Sunday school the Lord did
[51:51] it again the hybrid seed came in in the
[51:54] Garden of Eden and that day God promised
[51:57] there will be enity between me and that
[52:00] seed and I'm going to get that seed I'm
[52:02] going to bruise its head I'm going to
[52:04] stomp at it every day that's your
[52:06] commission don't forget about it your
[52:09] loved ones the sick ones the ones that
[52:11] in need that's your commission that's
[52:13] where God can work through you but you
[52:15] must be there Hallelujah he wants to but
[52:18] we don't make ourselves available for it
[52:20] come on now cuz we forget who we are we
[52:23] don't make ourselves available so God
[52:24] can work through us we get distracted Ed
[52:26] in a lady of see and age cuz we forgot
[52:29] our identity our identity is to finish
[52:32] the works of Christ and he says now his
[52:35] body and we'll finish that he says he um
[52:37] he was done to do that he was born to do
[52:40] that to destroy the works of the devil
[52:42] now his body is to do the
[52:45] same so we know he's The Headstone we
[52:49] know he's the head and when you look at
[52:51] the pyramid and I'm going to go there
[52:52] we'll come back there now if you look at
[52:54] the pyramid when God restored the church
[52:56] ages there's a Capstone that was off and
[52:59] that Capstone is love that's Jesus
[53:01] Christ that's coming down and it's
[53:03] coming on top of Brotherly Love so we
[53:05] know Luther uh sanctification West
[53:08] justification westle sanctification and
[53:11] then the gifts came back that's fine but
[53:13] we not there we went further so he took
[53:16] us out of this he took us out of this
[53:18] and he lifted us into there and and what
[53:22] happened is that Capstone Called Love
[53:24] came down and it's sitting on the BR
[53:27] Hallelujah and now they're
[53:29] won but see what we forget is because we
[53:32] won when the hate SE move the body moves
[53:37] yes sir but sometimes what we do is we
[53:38] think we're not one we think we're still
[53:41] there brotherly kindness we're not we
[53:44] are the most dangerous weapon upon this
[53:47] Earth today come on now that's right do
[53:50] you believe it yes see we get pushed
[53:53] around by every demon on this planet
[53:55] tries to try you because remember those
[53:58] demons are at war with you they're not
[54:01] at peace with you they know they've got
[54:02] a limited time all those like all the
[54:05] denominations and I'm going to shock you
[54:07] the demons also believe in Jesus Christ
[54:09] and they fear and
[54:11] tremble but we don't we don't see it
[54:14] like this when a demon acts out against
[54:16] the bride you know I walked into a golf
[54:18] shop the one day my wife's a
[54:21] witness and the moment I walked in I
[54:23] said hello guy that guy gave me such a
[54:26] look of hatred never saw him in my life
[54:29] not in my life and I just said hi and it
[54:33] looked like he wanted to rip my head
[54:35] off and Shantel looked at me she says
[54:38] did you see that I said yeah know I saw
[54:40] that she goes man that guy really hated
[54:43] you I'm like and I don't know why I
[54:45] don't know him from a bar of soap but I
[54:47] knew why yes because two Spirits
[54:50] collided right there amen because
[54:52] remember I am from God Amen so I'm not
[54:56] saying he's Satan but definitely
[54:58] something was manifesting on his face
[55:00] that did not like the spirit that was
[55:02] within me cuz I'm filled with the Holy
[55:03] Spirit I am sealed to the day of my
[55:05] Redemption but I'm the Bride In Action
[55:08] so that means everywhere you go every
[55:10] demon that goes before you you have
[55:12] authority you can cast out demons
[55:14] remember Jesus said so in my name you
[55:17] can do that but see with the bride it's
[55:19] different with the bride it gets
[55:22] personal because that's Christ actually
[55:25] doing the work through you not you doing
[55:27] the work it's Christ coming and doing
[55:29] the work you just need to surrender to
[55:31] the headship of
[55:32] Christ and this is why we come back here
[55:35] and he says this body will do the same
[55:37] because the body is the head and the
[55:39] body The Head and the body is together
[55:41] that's right if Christ is the head that
[55:45] was the word his body would do the same
[55:47] thing for he's the head is that right a
[55:49] church of the Worden amen so now you
[55:53] start reasoning or talking to people
[55:55] about baptisms and you talk of
[55:58] restoration you talk to people about how
[56:00] God sees a woman and God sees a man and
[56:03] you know he's a he and not a she he she
[56:05] or it or they or and you start telling
[56:08] them that that things like being a
[56:10] lesbian and gay and those things are
[56:12] wrong and now all of a sudden they think
[56:15] you're
[56:16] judging they do but they ask you honest
[56:20] question I got asked by a previous boss
[56:22] of me what do you think about gay
[56:24] people because they know there's
[56:26] something more about you but they want
[56:28] to trap you in your words he should have
[56:30] never asked me that question because I
[56:32] told him what God said about it and I
[56:35] stopped right there so we don't lie we
[56:38] don't take scriptures and hide it to to
[56:40] make ourselves we say the word amen if
[56:43] they can take it they're bride if they
[56:45] don't take it that's between them and
[56:47] God so remember they have eternal life
[56:51] people that love the Lord Jesus he says
[56:52] all that the father has given me now why
[56:55] shall they be cast out and all that
[56:56] comes to me now I so be cast out okay
[56:58] all that the father has given me is is
[57:00] mine shall come to me is mine but now
[57:02] what he says is all that comes to me I
[57:04] won't cast them out so they'll have
[57:05] eternal life don't get it wrong there's
[57:07] people out there that love the Lord just
[57:10] as much as you really some even more
[57:14] than
[57:17] you I'm being honest it's true we meet
[57:20] some people this week we wash windows
[57:22] for old old uh for people and and
[57:25] retirement just thanks Ben you reminded
[57:28] me of that and we met this lady
[57:31] wonderful lady you could the moment you
[57:34] walk into their house great atmosphere
[57:36] you know there's something more in this
[57:38] house godly people asked my wife really
[57:41] nice people and she asked me hey would
[57:45] you like a coffee or a or some water or
[57:48] biscuits or anything and I said yes
[57:49] straight
[57:51] away but
[57:53] why
[57:55] why that's it I want to show you
[57:58] something I'm going to I'm jumping H but
[58:01] I want to show you something I hope it's
[58:03] you yes so there's two scriptures he
[58:06] that receiveth you receiveth me and he
[58:09] that receiveth me uh receiveth him that
[58:12] sent me and he that receiveth a prophet
[58:14] in the name of a prophet shall get a
[58:15] prophet's reward okay and he that
[58:17] receives a righteous man in the name of
[58:18] a righteous man shall receive a
[58:20] righteous man's reward and who shall
[58:22] ever give to drink unto these little
[58:25] ones a cup of water only in the name of
[58:29] a disciple so hold on then I thought oh
[58:33] so what's the name of the disciple so I
[58:36] went and I said and John asked him so
[58:38] remember there was people that was
[58:40] casting out Satan and they there were
[58:42] other people that was praying and doing
[58:44] the work of God and then John goes hey
[58:46] saying master so these others that cast
[58:49] um this Devils out in thy name and that
[58:52] follow um not us and we forbid him
[58:55] because because he followed not us but
[58:57] Jesus said forbid him not yeah don't
[59:01] hinder him yeah don't don't try to now
[59:03] go all of a sudden oh you're not in the
[59:05] message so you can't do the Greater
[59:06] Works and hold on he's busy with God's
[59:08] work don't speak against it that's right
[59:10] let him do what he does Amen okay God
[59:13] wants to bring him God will bring him
[59:15] you cannot convince him into a being the
[59:17] bride he is he is who he is okay the
[59:20] bride's different I'm going to bring it
[59:22] now he says um for he there is no man
[59:27] which shall do a miracle in my name that
[59:29] can lightly speak of evil of me for he
[59:32] that is not against us is on our part
[59:36] for whatsoever shall give you whosoever
[59:39] shall give you a cup of water to drink
[59:41] in my
[59:42] name remember said disciples name just
[59:45] before but in my name this is Jesus
[59:47] talking because you belong to
[59:49] Christ so it's not just any person
[59:52] giving you a cup of water don't get me
[59:53] wrong there is still people that don't
[59:56] like God and will give you a cup of
[59:58] water and they might Reserve eternal
[1:00:00] life but that don't mean they bride see
[1:00:04] this is where it's different God called
[1:00:06] you to be bride because God wants to
[1:00:08] finish his work through you different
[1:00:10] work this work is to get the electing
[1:00:14] this word is to reach the the gospel to
[1:00:17] the elect not just to everyone but the
[1:00:20] ones that God wants us to do how many
[1:00:22] times do we pray and say Lord steer me
[1:00:25] to your El on cuz the reason we're not

[1:03:10] quickly I just I because I didn't want
[1:03:12] to be swayed by any other thing before I
[1:03:14] preach is what Brother Andy said right
[1:03:17] at the end he said he said the Lord said
[1:03:19] pray ye that the Lord will send laborers
[1:03:22] into his
[1:03:24] Vineyard guys there's not much much time
[1:03:26] left wake up that's right it's been
[1:03:29] preached and it's been preached and it's
[1:03:31] been preached I'm the more I walk in

[1:03:35] amen people are getting murdered left
[1:03:37] right and Center even in New Zealand
[1:03:39] that didn't happen 10 years ago if there
[1:03:42] was a casualty rate over the public

[1:03:51] anymore that's right young kids die
[1:03:53] drugs is taking over wake up yeah

[1:04:05] the spirit of rock and roll LED Elvis
[1:04:08] into an early grave with drugs what if
[1:04:10] you follow Elvis where you going to end
[1:04:12] up come on you are a follower of someone

[1:04:19] you're going to follow the world that's
[1:04:21] right and whoever is swinging your
[1:04:23] opinion where they end it up is where
[1:04:25] you you're going to end up because
[1:04:27] you're keeping your eyes on him but see
[1:04:29] he says she will receive this she never
[1:04:31] doubts this she doesn't she doesn't
[1:04:33] doubt this word she clings to it with
[1:04:36] all that she has yes and when she starts
[1:04:39] clinging to this word then miracles
[1:04:42] happen around her because Jesus said
[1:04:44] these signs shall follow them that
[1:04:46] believe shall follow them not lead them
[1:04:48] follow them and Jesus will go and you'll
[1:04:50] be walking one day and all of a go

[1:17:38] we just have little bit of uh uh words

[1:17:49] lot of work in the background Lord to to
[1:17:52] take this bride that came out of your

[1:19:11] must ride this Trail again Lord we must
[1:19:15] show the people and must show Satan Lord
[1:19:17] that your bride is not just a woman that
