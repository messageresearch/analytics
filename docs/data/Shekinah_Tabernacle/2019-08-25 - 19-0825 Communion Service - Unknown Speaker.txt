to South Africa and and question tell wanted to be with a granddad and it seemed like everything we wanted to do was hindering it hindering us to go back thee and we just don't understand why we knew that it was either the attack of the enemy or the will of the Lord so it's hard for a Christian to know when is it the will of the Lord and when is you you under attack and then I started singing this song and I said Lord I'll stand on your promises and whatever comes to pass is in your hands so as a Christian I can't lose so this is just a song I want to sing to declare that do not give up you stand on these promises and the Lord will make everything come to pass standing on the promises of Christ my king through eternal ages ladies places ring glory in the highest I'll shout and sing

thinking of the great price paid for us we thank you Lord bee or less be of those who could make him father in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen god bless you Fritz thank you musicians praise the Lord I mean let's let's turn to Exodus chapter 12 amen I mean let's turn to exist chapter 12 and eight a familiar scripture to us all but we're just gonna go read from verse 12 XS 12 and verse 5 down to verse 13 your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year he shall you shall take him out from the Sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the same and the whole Assembly of the congregation shall kill it and the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses and they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh and that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not have it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire has hid with his legs and with the pertinent parts thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remaineth until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded notice how there are there ready to move your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment I am the Lord and let's just read one more and me and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses which ye are and when I see the blood I'll pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt amen and let some amen this let's just leave it there may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this evening I want to speak about I wanted I wanted to take a scripture where you know notice how when they would as I as I pointed out we were reading in verse 11 that you know the tablet lends a line skirt at the shoes on their feet stuff in their hand eat it in haste they're ready to leave and I and I trust that you know in your own heart you're ready to leave this world you are you know we're so thankful you know you just think what a privilege it would have been in that day to kill the lamb I mean to roast the lamb to apply the blood hallelujah I mean take Castle yo sweep all the living out of your house and and and and be ready Amen for that time when the trumpet will blow and it would be time to leave we're in a leaving time I mean this message it's really you know the rapture is really the secret going away hallelujah of the bride a menace like you know Romeo and Juliet you know there's one night you know Romeo comes along with his letter brother Bram says goes up to the side of the house gets Juliet takes her away it's like that it's a secret going I mean but the bride is not surprised when the bridegroom arrives because he has but she has been expecting him hallelujah and I trust when you see that did in Christ rise and you will Amen you you're the first words I trust you might say as I've been expecting you I've been waiting for you to come hello Lou you here you are let's go hallelujah so you know here we are that we have a great privilege this this day to apply the blood now we understand that to apply the blood in this day is is that the literal life of God is applied in your life that he comes and dwells in you and notice that you know as he as Moses was instructed they had to apply the blood on the two side posts of the two side posts the door and the lintel so showing that it had to be applied to your body spirit and soul not just a part of your life you know but your whole being had to be under this blood and so I'm glad that you know when we apply the blood today we applied the Spirit of God you know we don't just apply it to our flesh we don't just apply it to our spirit I mean but we apply it to our soul to the whole body I mean that our whole life comes and under that blood and you know you you know you think about you know your brother bound dramatizes where he speaks about you know someone comes along maybe an Egyptian that's friends with the Israelites say come on gertie we're going to go out and party tonight and she said no not tonight we're under the blood I mean we've heard the call and you know we're under this blood and no doubt the person who tried to get the daughter to come out you know come out from under the blood she you think man you're trapped in that house what a prison that your parents have put you in I mean but if that daughter had a revelation she say no I'm safe in this place this is where I want to be this night I mean because in the morning we're leaving hallelujah but this night I'm staying under the blood the Death Angel can't get me because the blood is on the doorpost holy a death can't strike me can strike whoever but I'm under the blood amen and we've got to stay under the blood hallelujah this great Liberty to think that our Lord Jesus Christ as the Apostle Paul would say in first Corinthians 5 that he is our Passover I mean that he took his own life hallelujah died in our place took our sin upon himself went to hell in your place with your sin upon his shoulders I mean went down there took the house of your keys of healthier than the grave of the side of the devil rose triumphant holy and now he's here amen to apply his life and to yours amen to the death age you can't strike you a mint if it's in your hollow it should be in your home hallelujah if it's in your home and in you then it should be in your family I mean we have the privilege to apply the blood to apply the life of God how do you do that I mean prayerfully amen create an atmosphere around you that it will actually affect your family members amen hey if you want to create an atmosphere in your home I mean you just go punch a sibling you'll create an atmosphere hallelujah you've done something amen oh yeah but we don't want to create fighting in our homes we want peace we're on the devil to be driven out hallelujah we want eaten and now and our families and our homes they mean so you can create an atmosphere hallelujah but you've got to have the faith to do it I mean I'm glad you know as as an Egypt they were commanded just to take hyssop which is a common weed dip it in the blood and apply it to the door and lintel and it was just a common weed it wasn't something fancy they had to go find some where it was grown all over the place hallelujah but now so we have so it's just common faith applies the blood hallelujah I mean it's not some great big mountain faith it's common faith everyday faith the same faith you do to turn on your car to drive down the road or turn on your light switch you have to believe the light switch you'll work otherwise you'd use another one and with that same faith then you apply it to color the salvation of your house hallelujah but I'm glad that we're not just waving a bunch of hyssop around we have a blood to dip it into I mean we have a word to apply Oh hallelujah but now I want you I just want you to think now they they left Egypt under this by the strength of the lamb when they left Egypt there's not a feeble one among them they are all healthy they are all strong now it doesn't say they weren't feeble before Moses came into Egypt to deliver them so maybe they are some sick maybe some were on their deathbed but they when they ate the lamb you know you just think about your old grandparents or maybe some someone really sick in the home you go we're leaving tomorrow how are we going to leave I can't get off this bed just eat the lamb take the slammer wrap it eat the unleavened bread eat the lamb I can't walk I can't get there just start eating the word start eating the lamb I mean start listening to it start ingesting it start becoming one with it amen it will give you strength they meant to walk the journey hello you know give me strength to overcome Harley the devil always says there's no value in reading him you know what his brother am saying when he's asked how do you become a better Christian read your Bible pray every day and as my girls sing the song it makes you strong I mean so the opposite you get weak but the devil will never say hey listen read go pray go spend all the time no because he doesn't want you to be strong he doesn't want you to overcome him hallelujah but this strength you just eat the lamb grandma eat the lamb hallelujah oh my legs working give me another bite my other legs working now I'm dancing around the house I'm ready to go hallelujah why cuz under the strength of the lamb by the strength of that lamb by their sacrifice they left Egypt now you got to think about it now when when when when you know when when they left when they left Egypt every promise of that land belonged to them already they had every promise I meant their inheritance was already prophesied halia the cities of refuge you already prophesied right I meant where Benjamin would be where nefeli would be with Josh yo you know where where where all the tribes would be in the land it was already prophesied they just had to walk into it I mean they just had to go possess it so everything they had need of to go take the land they already had hallelujah and and going out under the blood lamb was like a downpayment to what they you know yo for the land right now you say that doesn't make too much sense now the Bible says grieve you don't the Holy Spirit we're by your seal to the day of redemption now many days we take that as a warning a negative thing and true we shouldn't grieve the Holy Ghost right we shouldn't we want to do live a life that's pleasing to him but if you're sealed unto the day of your redemption program set us like a railway car I mean it's packed then the inspector comes along make sure it's all packed properly that when it's traveling you know boxers don't move and stuff breaks and he puts a seal on the key closes the door puts a seal on the car and no one can break that seal until it reaches its destination I mean so it cannot be opened it cannot be tempted with until it gets to its predetermined destination I mean and once it gets there then it can come open he says it's the same thing with the seal of God hallelujah where we're sealed amen we cannot be unsealed till we get to the day of our until we get on the other land right and brother it says the the token it's like going on the airplane the stirrings are going to go on the airplane they can't go with money to the ticket counter saying four four tickets to South Africa please and and the end the end the person they would say well I can't give you a ticket what do you mean I've got the money people have the map see it's like people have faith be good to apply the faith to get the token right you say it so here's the money look here's the price and I'd say I'm sorry I can't give you boarding passes with this money well what do you mean you've got to go buy the ticket but I have the money no no you ever go buy the ticket but once you get that ticket and you're booked into the flight you have to go on the flight amen who feels relaxed after they've checked them you know who feels relaxed you've gone through security you check then got your boarding pass gone through security you know where your gaiters wait because you know you have faith that your plane amen if it's working you're going hallelujah so you can now relax because you know you're on your way to your destination and it's the same thing as being sealed into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost we have the down payment it's as if we're already there I mean it's as if we're already there because we're seal to the day of our redemption hallelujah so now we're just walking in victory hallelujah we just walk in victory we're not walking in defeat hallelujah walking in victory it's all mine the whole land is mine I can't be lost I can't be you know cast aside I'm sealed in hallelujah I have redemption be following me so it's like you know because we think won't it be wonderful there I can't know how the song goes but won't it be wonderful there it'll be glorious just think all the saints redeemed a thing you know I can't wait til we get there it'll be glorious but we have the downpayment the believer has what they need I mean because remember remember we have a short token we have the ticket to get on the plane and our names on it hallelujah I mean so we have we have a short token to get there that you take all the fear away should take all the worry away should take all the flus durations away I know where I'm going hallelujah I know that the lamb will get me there hallelujah so you know I think we should be the happiest people in all the world Lord you became our Passover you he became our sacrifice that you can take me to heaven hellooo yeah isn't that what we're living for we're striving for amen but then everything if we are sealed into the kingdom every redemptive blessing belongs to us every single one of them hallelujah deliverance healing eternal life peace joy love suffering I mean all those things but don't let the devil ever rub you to try and make you think it doesn't belong to you I mean if you have the token of the Holy Ghost it's yours hello you fall heir to all things in Christ Jesus hallelujah so your families yours amen healings yours pieces yours the Holy Ghost is yours I mean God works in the impossible hallelujah amen he said well how is he gonna do it I don't know I don't know how he's gonna do it but that's not my he takes care of the details it's like you take a boss he's got a big vision he wants it all done he just tells his workers I want this done he walks away and then now they've got to work out now how are we gonna do this thing we've got a deadline amen you know it's like us we don't need to take care of the details he takes care of the details do we have confidence brother em says the key to every door the door is the promise his faith in the finished work of the of Calvary that opens every door every door is open by faith in the finished work of the cross hallelujah so now so that opens a door to healing it opens the door to our family coming in a manor opens the door to the Holy Ghost moving in our church it opens the door to the Holy Ghost moving in our lives and our family wherever we may be that the faith and the promise work because it's already paid for we just got to go walk and enjoy it hallelujah amen so you say well why why why are you talking about these things because I think when we take the we know that's just symbolic there you know the unleavened bread and the wine but we should have such Thanksgiving in our hearts he became he became our Passover he chose to hallelujah he said to his disciples you haven't chosen me I've chosen you he chose you and he already decided I'm gonna be your son barrier the Death Angel can't strike you if I'm your barrier hallelujah I'm gonna be your shield I'm gonna be your mighty tower I mean I'm gonna be your protection you've just got to come in hallelujah and I've invited you to come in hallelujah and once you're in ain't you glad you're in you think I want yo you think about Noah and his family in the ark in the rain falls and the boat God close the door but then it's that first time the boat actually floats you know what kind of feeling that would have been you know what feeling that would have been I'm so glad Noah dad I'm so glad you kept this vision in front of me for 120 years you showed me the plans you kept in front of me I want to do other things I wanted to go don't know but you kept it in front of me we're building this boat children come on this is what's the plans are they building a boat amen maybe there would have been hard times maybe it would have been quite stressful sometimes gangster's certain beams in place and whatever more but finally the vision became material hallelujah you know and sometimes maybe we think what's the use there's use it's worth it it's worth every every step of the way I mean children young people we've received a word that will change our body I mean we've received pardoning grace I mean this message is pardoning grace to you and I I'm in this but it's got body changing ability in it holy it's gonna take us to heaven and because Jesus died for our sins then he sends a word to transform these bodies I mean to manifest what he did on Calvary for us hallelujah think you got to keep it in front of your children it's worth it don't worry about what everyone else is doing you know the news then uses is the same kind of thing different people we can week at day and day up same thing different people amen what's going around the world it's got to happen but that's not our portion I mean our portion is a rapture Oh our portion is a body changed that's our portion that's our inheritance and he paid that for it to happen hallelujah so keep it in front dad why he putting blood on the door and lintel cause the word seat I'm applying blood to this home but our neighbors will think we're mad I don't care that's irrelevant we received a word from God a vindicated word and said apply the blood and I'm applying the blood and faith and I believe it's going to make a difference hallelujah Amen if he can if he can you know turn the Nile into blood and do all these different things I believe the same commandment amen will make a difference hallelujah are you sure dad yes what's going to happen we're gonna be safe that's the main thing it's gonna save us but I'm the firstborn he sure he's never told us something wrong yet this word has not failed us yet hallelujah that's how I know hallelujah you think why are you dressed dead well you got your stuff in your hand why are you eating like this we're leaving we're not having this Passover to stay we're having this Passover under expectation to leave hallelujah but we've been here a long time but now it's a different time it's a different day amen humanity's been going on no matter how many thousand years but now it's a different our time any tennis time and eternity is blending together hallelujah friends we can not in it and I'm just gonna throw this in there we cannot keep the grace dispensation going forever amen the bride's got to be called we've got to come to our position now I don't say that to mean that I want God to pour his wrath out I don't want him to do it but I want great I want us to go home I mean we're not here to have another seven Church ages we're at the last day in the last time hallelujah and there comes a time where there will be no time I mean and we're living in that hour Hollywood they were in there in Egypt 400 odd years but now was the last night and I tell you there was a cry in that day like they'd never been but for those under the blood it was a rejoicing because that was the last thing that broke Pharaoh's grip and they left haloo you and that's why myself I think we should rejoice but with such a trembling and a Thanksgiving such a sincerity Lord you allowed me remember this is not a democracy this is God's sovereign choosing he quickens who he will he has mercy upon who will he pardons who he will he he washes away the sin of who he will amen you never saw God God sought you and but you had to come to a place where you responded amen it wasn't you deciding I'm going to be a Christian today no no God found you God look God hunted you hallelujah and that's why I should say thank you Lord you allow you invited me I didn't invite myself I didn't I didn't crash this party myself you invited me to come hallelujah you furnish me with the robe of righteousness and when you washed all my sins away you wash the world off my Europe off me you changed me you you invited me and Here I am hallelujah this isn't my choosing Amen I wanted to be a professor I wanted to climb an ivory tower do chemistry or biochemistry whatever that was that was my ambition in life but he had other ideas amen honestly I didn't you would never find me I would never come you wouldn't find me in a place like this but I hate I hate I received an invitation and something in me said I'm gonna receive this hallelujah just like the woman we spoke about who washed Jesus's feet brother Graham said that she gave her best because that was her time she didn't have another opportunity she gave her best she bought the best she gave everything she had into that sacrifice everything so she couldn't turn back to anything amen I like to burn bridges I mean I burnt my bridge with the world I can't turn back I won't go back there's nowhere to go there's no crossing I can't find the way and I'm not looking for the way cuz there's one way I'm and that's up into glory hallelujah that's why I wanna go that's the only way to go there's nowhere else to go what's it gonna be hallelujah there's only but there can't we stay in Egypt no we can't stay they're gonna kick us out I'm glad there's no I can't find the crossing to go back I don't want to go back I'm not afraid I will but there's no where I got everything I all all they're all my old life I put it in his feet say Lord do what you want you've invited me to this feast you invited me to this feast no I don't know what it entails necessarily but here I am hallelujah I didn't have a chance to go to all the hell was the message in the Bible that he found me hallelujah I'm so glad he found me I'm so glad he say I've invited you to sit at a winning supper table I mean I became your Passover I became your lamb I became your sacrifice hallelujah then you don't need to go be lost you don't need to go through a tribulation you don't need to stand before one throw judgment hallelujah facing an angry god but you can receive wrap shrink pardoning grace right now I just said you slaughtered understand but here I come hallelujah and it's been glorious and it is glorious and that's why I think we should say thank you lord thank you I'm not just going with the crowd thank you I'm not just here because mommy and daddy are here but because you called me to become one with you to enjoy myself with you that you took all my shame you think it wasn't exchange we have nothing to give them this good now we have no merit nothing that's not some like oh I'll give you this if you give me that it's not some bargaining thing we just we have shame and guilt and sin and brokenness and questions and frustrations and all we have nothing to go we say Lord take this and these I'll be waiting for you to give it to me hallelujah what we give me in return righteousness eternal life peace joy hallelujah that's what he wants to give us he doesn't want to give us anything bad he has no strings attached hallelujah he they have eternal life my child that's what I want to give you say thank you lord I receive it in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why are we so thankful but lord I have no strength I'll give you strength but I can't do
