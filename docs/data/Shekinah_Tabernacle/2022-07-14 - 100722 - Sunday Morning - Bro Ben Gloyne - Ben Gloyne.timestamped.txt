[45:55] your glory in jesus christ's name amen
[45:59] amen god bless your friends you may have
[46:00] your seats this morning so i've been
[46:02] talking for those who are just visiting
[46:04] i've been talking about the devil's
[46:05] mental health crisis for the past couple
[46:07] of sundays he's having a mental health
[46:09] crisis and um i just want to kind of
[46:12] maybe wrap this up a little bit but it
[46:14] but uh but if i could subtitle this i'd
[46:16] say it's time to plague his kingdom amen
[46:18] we're you know we're living in a time
[46:20] where where you know we're living in an
[46:22] exodus hour and if we're looking back in
[46:24] the first two exoduses we see the
[46:26] pattern repeating where where in the
[46:29] first exodus you know moses was sent
[46:31] down into egypt to deliver a people
[46:34] now there's a saying that it takes uh it
[46:37] takes way less time to destroy something
[46:40] than it is to build it oh yeah now if
[46:41] you just look at egypt to where it was
[46:44] when moses stepped in there and said let
[46:46] my people go
[46:47] there was generations of effort manpower
[46:50] resources great battles were fought
[46:53] buildings were built great cities were
[46:55] constructed it was generations of effort
[46:59] to build it
[47:00] but then i was looking into how long was
[47:03] the gap between when moses first went in
[47:05] before pharaoh and then when they left
[47:07] after the passover and um it doesn't
[47:10] exactly say in the scripture if you can
[47:12] light me on that that'd be real nice but
[47:13] some people said it's around about 40
[47:15] days
[47:16] and even if it was longer than that it
[47:18] didn't it didn't take very long
[47:20] relatively to how long it took to build
[47:22] egypt to tear it down and what i love
[47:24] about this is that the devil can be
[47:26] building complexes and spirits and for
[47:28] generations and families it can be
[47:30] passed down and you know stubbornness
[47:33] unforgiveness business resentment
[47:34] whatever it is it can be generations of
[47:36] work the devil's been working on a
[47:38] family for generations but then just in
[47:40] a moment when the anointing of god
[47:42] strikes that person that's all
[47:43] demolished
[47:44] hallelujah so i'm so glad that we're
[47:47] anointed to tear satan's kingdom down
[47:50] and this is what gives the devil a great
[47:52] mental health crisis we're here to
[47:54] torment his work i mean i'm not talking
[47:56] about remember we do not fight against
[47:58] flesh and blood
[47:59] right but we war against spiritual
[48:02] wickedness demon powers in high places
[48:04] it says in second corinthians 10 for
[48:06] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[48:08] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[48:10] our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[48:12] through god to the pulling down of
[48:14] strongholds casting down imaginations
[48:16] and every high thing that exalts itself
[48:18] against the knowledge of god
[48:20] and bring into captivity every thought
[48:22] to the obedience of christ i mean so we
[48:24] war against demon power but we're here
[48:26] to cast it down we're here to tear
[48:29] satan's kingdom down amen through the
[48:32] anointing of god you just think about
[48:33] those four friends that they carried
[48:35] their crippled or sick friend on on the
[48:38] stretcher they tried to get to jesus
[48:40] they couldn't get through the door into
[48:41] the house they went to the top of the
[48:42] house nothing was going to stop them
[48:45] they began to tear the tiles up they
[48:47] they stole the sunroof free of charge
[48:49] amen because they weren't willing to let
[48:52] anything stop amen their friend getting
[48:55] into the prince of god and it was and
[48:57] when jesus jesus looked and the
[48:59] scripture says when jesus saw their
[49:01] faith not the crippled man's faith but
[49:03] their faith
[49:04] he said you know take up your bed and
[49:06] walk he says but what's easy oh he said
[49:08] thy sins a forgiven thing
[49:10] he says what's easy to say guy sends a
[49:12] figure and then he'll take up thy bed
[49:13] and walk and he picks up his bed and he
[49:15] packs it out the door i mean but it
[49:17] shows that i don't know how long it took
[49:18] to build that house but it took less
[49:20] time to destroy the roof and lower him
[49:23] into the presence of god that it took to
[49:25] build it amen so by prayer we can tear
[49:27] the roof off every situation i mean by
[49:30] prayer we can we can create an entrance
[49:32] for others into the presence of god and
[49:35] when god sees your faith he answers your
[49:37] prayer for them i mean that man could
[49:38] not get in his own strength as it was
[49:40] his friend's strength that got him in
[49:42] there hallelujah so we can do the same
[49:44] thing today remember we're not here to
[49:46] be slaves
[49:47] we're not here just to put up with satan
[49:49] amen no no that's not our job
[49:51] description our job description is satan
[49:53] destroyer serpent bruiser amen we're
[49:56] here to crush demons under our feet by
[49:58] the anointing of god that is our job
[50:01] description that is who we are now we
[50:03] know that the devil kicks the most just
[50:06] before he's going to be cast out
[50:09] that's that's a pattern that you know
[50:10] that's how he works
[50:12] jesus would be uh uh you know a a boy
[50:15] with an epileptic spirit
[50:17] a dumb and deaf spirit rather was
[50:19] brought before him his disciples
[50:21] couldn't couldn't couldn't cast it out
[50:22] but then says here in mark 9 23-29 jesus
[50:26] said unto him if thou can believe all
[50:28] things are possible to him that
[50:29] believeth
[50:30] so it's up to your faith
[50:33] it's not what everyone else is doing
[50:34] what are you doing
[50:36] what are you doing about it and straight
[50:38] away the father of child cried out and
[50:39] said with tears lord i believe help thou
[50:42] might unbelief that's a good way to be
[50:44] lord i believe but help my faith amen to
[50:46] apprehend the promise
[50:48] help my unbelief when jesus saw that the
[50:50] people came running together he rebuked
[50:52] the foul spirit saying unto him thou
[50:54] dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come
[50:56] out of him and enter no more unto him
[50:58] and the spirit cried out rent and saw
[51:00] came out of him and he was as one dead
[51:02] and so much as many said
[51:04] uh he is dead but jesus took him by the
[51:06] hand and lifted up and he arose amen so
[51:10] now the devil is kicking because he has
[51:12] been cast out
[51:13] and and the devil's kicking in this hour
[51:16] like never before because this is the
[51:18] hour of his greatest defeat
[51:19] this is the hour where he is cast out of
[51:22] a people and he cannot like down through
[51:24] the church ages where there'll be a
[51:25] cycle of revival and death revival and
[51:28] death so there'll be revival but the
[51:30] devil say i'll just wait a bit longer
[51:31] i'm going to get them
[51:33] but there's a people upon the earth
[51:35] right now where it's not a cycle of
[51:37] revival and death not just getting
[51:39] excited and calling off and all those
[51:41] things there's just revival into revival
[51:44] into revival where god has called now
[51:46] for a cycle of the bride's revival not a
[51:50] church revival but an unending cycle of
[51:52] revival you know it's very important we
[51:54] keep these things before us because it
[51:56] would change the course of our lives
[51:58] you know i was looking at history and
[52:00] george whitfield who was a who was a um
[52:04] he was a contemporary of of john wesley
[52:06] he was part of actually the uh uh the
[52:10] holiness club or the holy club that that
[52:12] that john wesley was part of when he was
[52:14] at university and he would preach about
[52:17] how everyone must have a new birth he
[52:20] actually brought out he he brought that
[52:22] concept out into you know out into the
[52:24] public arena like never before
[52:26] and he believed that every uh every
[52:29] truly religious person needs the
[52:30] experience of a rebirth in jesus christ
[52:33] and so and he and he didn't care for the
[52:36] for the distinctions of denominational
[52:38] geography so basically he didn't care
[52:40] where you came from
[52:41] how you spoke your nationality well he
[52:43] didn't care about that stuff about your
[52:45] religious passages you must be born
[52:47] again
[52:48] and and he preached in the american cul
[52:50] of the british american colonies and he
[52:52] preached this in the uh early methodist
[52:54] movement and he processed you know he
[52:56] preached this new birth you must be born
[52:58] again and it created an awakening in
[53:00] those colonies where they realized we
[53:02] don't have to be subservient to a
[53:04] government across the sea it was a big
[53:07] part of the american revolution was his
[53:09] preaching not that he was preaching
[53:10] revolution but he's preaching a new
[53:12] birth where people could have a new
[53:13] identity a new life not just a reformed
[53:16] life but a new life be transformed by
[53:18] the spirit of god
[53:19] and it actually generated a revolution
[53:22] amen amen and if we could just keep
[53:24] before us that we are the sons and
[53:25] daughters of god i mean we're born with
[53:27] the price the precious blood of jesus
[53:29] christ that we don't need to bow down to
[53:31] the devil into his lives we are not as
[53:33] slaves we're not as property amen but we
[53:36] are called for you know our position as
[53:39] he is under our feet and we are standing
[53:41] on his head i mean we're standing on his
[53:43] neck amen so it's so important i think
[53:45] to keep before us this is the hour of
[53:47] liberty this is the hour of restoration
[53:49] because god is calling for restoration
[53:52] not that just man is calling for it god
[53:54] is calling for a complete and utter
[53:57] restoration amen where people are
[53:59] restored to the acts of you know the
[54:01] faith of the fathers i mean we're back
[54:03] to an original genuine pentecost before
[54:06] the church ever fell where god walked in
[54:08] power and his people they walked in
[54:10] humility they were surrendered to the
[54:12] will of god they didn't care about
[54:14] anything but him amen and this is what
[54:16] this message has done is called this
[54:18] brought us back to a true restoration
[54:21] hallelujah i've
[54:23] many times but i'll share it one more
[54:24] time i was there in papua new papua new
[54:27] guinea the last time and i was saying
[54:28] this message brings us back to a genuine
[54:30] pentecost and the interpreter stopped
[54:32] interpreting for about three or four
[54:34] minutes because everyone understood in
[54:35] their own language
[54:36] and and and some of the men there
[54:38] they're all stoic men one of the pastors
[54:40] very stock man and he and you're after
[54:42] the service i didn't know what was going
[54:43] on but after the service he came and
[54:45] tried to close in prayers just weeping
[54:47] over the pulpit they were just so blown
[54:49] away what was going on and but the thing
[54:51] is god did that to prove it's more this
[54:53] is more than just words friends this is
[54:55] more than just a nice idea this is
[54:57] reality
[54:58] amen it's not just a bunch of doctrine
[54:59] to argue over and fast and fight and
[55:01] stew no no there's promises that god has
[55:03] released in this hour and they're for
[55:05] you and i
[55:06] amen but the devil will try and stop us
[55:09] from obtaining those promises that's his
[55:11] job but we're here to cast him out now
[55:14] moses would step down and to step down
[55:16] into egypt
[55:18] and you think about the destruction that
[55:20] was laid waste to that kingdom
[55:22] now you type the natural with the
[55:23] spiritual
[55:25] so when when israel walked out of egypt
[55:28] now this is probably not everything but
[55:29] you go read the account of the exodus
[55:32] egypt was literally decimated their
[55:35] cattle were destroyed
[55:36] all vegetation was eaten eaten up by
[55:39] locusts the nile was turned to blood so
[55:42] all fish were dead
[55:44] their army or at least the greatest part
[55:46] of it was annihilated in the red sea
[55:48] their firstborn were dead and they gave
[55:51] the israelites all their riches as they
[55:53] went
[55:54] so before before moses stepped in they
[55:57] were prospering they were doing really
[55:58] well
[55:59] when they walked out the place was
[56:02] literally in ruin that's right amen this
[56:05] is how powerful god is and how
[56:07] determined he is that his children will
[56:09] go free they're not going to stay bound
[56:11] they're not going to stay slaves he's
[56:13] determined that they're walking free it
[56:15] doesn't matter how many plagues are
[56:16] gonna come on satan's kingdom he's just
[56:18] gonna pour it out and pour it out and
[56:21] pour it out and god wants to plague
[56:23] satan's kingdom through you
[56:25] i just jump to the end of my sermon he
[56:27] wants to plague satan's kingdom through
[56:28] you it's not through someone else
[56:30] through your lips amen he wants to tear
[56:32] satan's kingdom down
[56:34] hallelujah
[56:36] amen it was absolutely destroyed
[56:39] you take the second exodus now it wasn't
[56:41] a physical structures that were
[56:43] destroyed or
[56:44] an economy of a people i mean but it was
[56:46] idols of unbelief superstition and sins
[56:49] in people's hearts god just came in and
[56:51] tore it all down
[56:52] no no that's not meant to be there i'm
[56:54] gonna renovate these people i'm gonna
[56:55] transform these people by the baptism of
[56:58] the holy ghost i'm not just going to
[56:59] give them a paint job i'm going to
[57:01] transform their inside
[57:02] the things they once walked with and say
[57:04] well this is just how we are we're just
[57:06] gone
[57:07] hey man it's the same thing with you and
[57:08] i today friends god we're not here to be
[57:11] a patch-up job this is not a renovation
[57:13] center i mean this word transforms
[57:16] changes into new creatures hallelujah
[57:18] that is what it does and that's what
[57:20] we've seen it do amen hallelujah
[57:23] amen praise the lord that's right
[57:26] hallelujah
[57:27] amen amen the third exodus in the same
[57:29] way
[57:31] we know now
[57:34] first exodus we know was leaving israel
[57:36] leaving egypt to a promised land second
[57:38] exodus was the believer leaving the old
[57:40] testament law and formal worship going
[57:42] into the baptism of the holy ghost this
[57:44] third exodus is those who are in the
[57:45] baptism of the holy ghost going into
[57:47] another world amen hallelujah and he's
[57:49] called us for that isn't that wonderful
[57:51] hey bender so so as these exoduses go
[57:54] along i mean there's a there's a there's
[57:56] a repeat of satan's kingdom being laid
[57:58] waste yes amen you see you've got to
[58:01] you've got to look at the enemy in the
[58:02] eye
[58:03] see the problem is time can be such a
[58:05] curse because the longer a promise
[58:06] lingers many people their faith begins
[58:08] to wane but we should be like the faith
[58:11] we should have the faith of abraham
[58:12] where though it may linger though it's
[58:14] coming amen though though the vision may
[58:17] carry it will be fulfilled i mean so we
[58:19] should never look at time and say well i
[58:21] guess it wasn't for me it's for you
[58:23] i mean you'd never let time weigh down
[58:25] your faith it should actually increase
[58:26] your faith because the longer time goes
[58:29] in the human mind the more impossible it
[58:31] gets and the more impossible it gets
[58:33] it's the more god steps in
[58:35] hallelujah so we should never ever let
[58:37] the promise of god slip
[58:39] but we should hold them close
[58:42] hallelujah
[58:43] amen
[58:44] the devil's howling in this hour
[58:47] brother i'm saying christ is a mystery
[58:48] god revealed he says identified as
[58:50] speaking about the bride of christ
[58:51] identified with the word i mean christ
[58:54] living in them oh the devil's howling
[58:55] about this the manifested truth of the
[58:57] promise of the word and her alone
[59:00] they don't have the answer when jesus
[59:01] came why didn't those pharisees he said
[59:03] if i cast out devils by the finger of
[59:05] god who do you cast him out by sea he
[59:08] stood alone and his church stands alone
[59:10] she's not hooked up with nothing but he
[59:12] was identified by god being the body
[59:14] that god dwelt in and the church is
[59:16] identified by his body doing the same
[59:19] thing she is his body the manifested
[59:21] truth of his promised word for the last
[59:23] days and she and she alone stands by it
[59:26] that's why the devil is howling these
[59:28] great organizations to set up something
[59:30] to close her up they'll never do it
[59:33] she'll be taken up not closed up she has
[59:36] now risen by the power of the vindicated
[59:38] word promised to her amen
[59:41] amen so we shouldn't be just expecting
[59:43] some slow motion train wreck going on
[59:46] where we're going to be shut down and
[59:47] blah blah who cares about the four walls
[59:49] anyway
[59:50] but the prophet said she'll she won't be
[59:52] closed up she'll be taken up i mean so
[59:54] when the hour when it gets the darkest
[59:56] member dawn's coming another day's
[59:58] coming the sun's coming it's always the
[1:00:01] darkest and coldest just before dawn i
[1:00:03] mean but the darker and colder it gets
[1:00:05] it means dawn is getting real close i
[1:00:07] mean there's a new day dawning so don't
[1:00:09] get caught up in the darkness and how
[1:00:11] cold it may be now look the sun's coming
[1:00:13] up hallelujah amen she won't be closed
[1:00:16] up she's going to be taken up he says
[1:00:17] they'll never do it
[1:00:19] amen now a bride holds that promise he
[1:00:22] told me he would return for me i'll
[1:00:24] believe it aha yes sir tomato head sheep
[1:00:27] head her headship her redeemer her
[1:00:30] husband her king her lord her lover her
[1:00:32] savior in the promised meeting place
[1:00:34] which is in the meeting of the year amen
[1:00:37] now the devil kicks the most when he's
[1:00:39] about to be cast out
[1:00:41] and he puts pressure on just before
[1:00:43] deliverance comes
[1:00:44] now it's amazing when you look into
[1:00:47] uh
[1:00:47] exodus here if we go to exodus chapter
[1:00:50] four if i have it here you know god
[1:00:52] already tells moses what the end was
[1:00:54] going to be
[1:00:55] he says in exodus 4 and 21
[1:00:58] he said and the lord said unto moses
[1:01:00] when now goes to return into egypt so
[1:01:03] he's not even there yet this is this is
[1:01:04] the by the burning bush god's giving
[1:01:06] these instructions i think it's here
[1:01:08] when though guys to return into egypt
[1:01:09] see that thou do all these wonders
[1:01:11] before pharaoh which i put into thine
[1:01:13] hand but i will harden his heart and he
[1:01:16] shall not let the people go
[1:01:18] so moses already is no knows what's
[1:01:20] going to happen
[1:01:21] and thou shalt send a pharaoh thus saith
[1:01:23] the lord israel is my son even my
[1:01:25] firstborn
[1:01:27] and i say unto thee let my people go
[1:01:29] that he may serve me and if thou refuse
[1:01:31] to let him go behold i will slay thy son
[1:01:34] even thy firstborn that was the last
[1:01:36] plague that came upon egypt so moses
[1:01:39] already knew the in end result of what's
[1:01:41] going to happen he didn't walk in there
[1:01:43] blind saying well yeah i wonder if
[1:01:45] pharaoh's going to do it no it was going
[1:01:47] to come down to this crunch point
[1:01:50] we know what's going to happen in the
[1:01:51] outcome of this exodus
[1:01:53] amen where our where where the apostle
[1:01:55] paul would write in first corinthians 15
[1:01:57] behold i show you a mystery you shall
[1:01:59] not all sleep but you shall all be
[1:02:01] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:02:03] an eye at the last trump for the trumpet
[1:02:05] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:02:07] incorruptible and ye shall all be
[1:02:10] changed for this corrupt rule must put
[1:02:12] on incorruption and this mortal must put
[1:02:14] on immortality so when this couple shall
[1:02:16] have put on incorruption and this mortal
[1:02:18] shall put on immortality then shall be
[1:02:20] brought to pass the saying that is
[1:02:22] written death is swallowed up in victory
[1:02:25] so we know the end result of this exodus
[1:02:27] do we not amen we're not just gonna god
[1:02:29] hasn't called us just to leave us
[1:02:30] halfway right when moses was
[1:02:32] commissioned by god to go down into
[1:02:34] egypt god didn't just quit because
[1:02:37] pharaoh's heart was hardened that's
[1:02:38] right right it never got too hard for
[1:02:40] god god was determined i'm going to call
[1:02:42] my son out of egypt you're going down
[1:02:44] there to do the job
[1:02:46] hallelujah and even before
[1:02:48] you know what i love about it is even
[1:02:50] before
[1:02:51] israel went down into egypt there israel
[1:02:54] as in jacob became israel
[1:02:56] you know and they went down into egypt
[1:02:58] even before it went into the pharaoh's
[1:03:00] mind i'm going to turn these people into
[1:03:01] slaves
[1:03:02] even before israel cried out because of
[1:03:05] the slavery god had already given a
[1:03:07] prophecy to abraham
[1:03:09] that that he said to abraham abraham
[1:03:11] your seat is going to sow during a
[1:03:13] strange land 400 years they're going to
[1:03:14] be afflicted but i'm going to bring them
[1:03:16] out with a mighty hand and with a great
[1:03:17] substance so even before it came into
[1:03:19] the heart of pharaoh i'm going to throw
[1:03:21] these boy baby boys into the nile even
[1:03:24] before he decided i'm going to afflict
[1:03:25] them as as slaves god had already
[1:03:28] prophesied this is what's going to
[1:03:29] happen but then this is what's going to
[1:03:31] happen so you're going to be slaves but
[1:03:33] then you're going to come out with a
[1:03:34] mighty hand so what i love about it is
[1:03:36] that god would god would call us
[1:03:39] he would think of us before the
[1:03:40] foundation of the world he would write
[1:03:42] our names in the lamb's book of life
[1:03:44] before the foundational world before the
[1:03:46] devil ever came into existence before
[1:03:48] lucifer ever decided hey i'm better than
[1:03:50] everyone else i can make a better
[1:03:52] kingdom than god
[1:03:53] before that ever happened god already
[1:03:56] made a way
[1:03:57] amen for us to defeat our enemy so the
[1:03:59] and then he even said to job job
[1:04:02] where were you here's job sitting on his
[1:04:04] sheep he's all in despair doesn't know
[1:04:05] what's going on god comes down to him
[1:04:07] i'm going to answer you job and he would
[1:04:08] say job where were you when i laid the
[1:04:11] foundation of the world where the
[1:04:12] morning stars and the sons of god all
[1:04:14] shouted for joy hallelujah so he's
[1:04:16] telling job job before you ever set foot
[1:04:19] on this earth
[1:04:20] in my mind you're shouting in my mind
[1:04:22] you're praising and you're in my mind
[1:04:25] you're worshiping me
[1:04:26] hallelujah so joke you're in this small
[1:04:28] space of time but i didn't see you just
[1:04:30] as this is not your end
[1:04:32] this is just a transition place i've got
[1:04:34] to use you as a testimony job because
[1:04:36] you found favor in my sight because
[1:04:38] you're a perfect man hallelujah so jesus
[1:04:41] job when i saw you before the foundation
[1:04:43] of the world i didn't see you on this
[1:04:45] ash sheep
[1:04:46] i saw you shouting for joy
[1:04:48] and if god thought of us that way
[1:04:50] there's no
[1:04:51] in eternity before the devil ever came
[1:04:54] into existence nothing the devil can do
[1:04:57] in time
[1:04:58] can disrupt where we're going to end up
[1:05:00] nothing absolutely nothing
[1:05:03] so it doesn't matter how hard it gets
[1:05:05] how much trials come how many struggles
[1:05:07] we have amen if god thought of me before
[1:05:10] the foundation of the world i'm going to
[1:05:11] end up there
[1:05:13] hallelujah
[1:05:14] amen so so it's amazing the prophecy was
[1:05:17] already given
[1:05:19] that they're going to be in slavery but
[1:05:20] they're going to come out with a mighty
[1:05:21] hand
[1:05:22] and it's it's exactly what happened
[1:05:25] hallelujah
[1:05:26] hallelujah
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:29] so now
[1:05:31] as i said before the devil puts pressure
[1:05:32] on just before deliverance comes
[1:05:35] now when moses went into went and spoke
[1:05:37] to pharaoh pharaoh just said well i'm
[1:05:39] just going to just going to increase the
[1:05:40] burdens of the israelites because you're
[1:05:42] going to try and break them
[1:05:43] try and get them to look at natural
[1:05:45] things so he said i'm not going to give
[1:05:47] you any more straw to make bricks you
[1:05:49] got to find your own straw
[1:05:50] and you know i'm going to increase your
[1:05:52] burden i'm going to increase your
[1:05:53] bondage and so what he was trying to get
[1:05:55] them to do was take their eyes because
[1:05:58] what was moses he was fulfilled
[1:06:00] scripture walking in
[1:06:02] i am the man he could have said i'm the
[1:06:03] manifestation of the prophecy given to
[1:06:06] our father abraham
[1:06:08] he was he was the he was the prophecy
[1:06:09] fulfilled
[1:06:11] right so so the israelites could have
[1:06:12] just looked at him and said praise the
[1:06:14] lord
[1:06:16] we're on our way out amen hallelujah
[1:06:19] who cares what the devil can who cares
[1:06:20] what pharaoh can do to us actually no no
[1:06:23] if he's the fulfillment of the deliverer
[1:06:25] and i'm the one that needs deliverance
[1:06:27] i'm being delivered
[1:06:29] hallelujah so they could have just
[1:06:31] rejoiced amen had just walked on anyway
[1:06:33] but then when pharaoh put that increase
[1:06:36] when he when he made the people find
[1:06:37] their own straw increase their tally of
[1:06:39] bricks and different things all it was
[1:06:41] trying to do is get the people to take
[1:06:43] their eyes off the promise that was
[1:06:45] being fulfilled right in their midst
[1:06:47] right there remember this wasn't a one
[1:06:49] day he's coming he was there he was
[1:06:51] walking around in in in sandals with the
[1:06:54] staff of deliverance the deliverer was
[1:06:55] there it wasn't one day he's coming he
[1:06:57] was there they were in the fulfillment
[1:06:59] of the word
[1:07:00] amen but the but but the pharaoh was
[1:07:02] trying to get them to take their eyes
[1:07:04] off the promise that was right among
[1:07:05] them
[1:07:06] and try and get them to look at natural
[1:07:08] things
[1:07:09] of bricks and straw that was their
[1:07:11] burden they even complained to moses
[1:07:13] complain to pharaoh everyone's you know
[1:07:15] this is not fair you've increased our
[1:07:16] burden
[1:07:17] what they should have done is praise the
[1:07:19] lord amen
[1:07:20] hallelujah sure there's a lot of
[1:07:22] pressure right now on this age but we're
[1:07:24] about to leave
[1:07:25] we're about to walk out of here this is
[1:07:27] the hour
[1:07:28] hallelujah he tried to keep them
[1:07:31] looking on natural things instead of the
[1:07:33] reality of the deliverance right in
[1:07:35] their midst we must never ever just
[1:07:37] focus on natural things
[1:07:39] and take our eyes off the promised word
[1:07:41] that's being fulfilled right now
[1:07:43] hallelujah
[1:07:45] amen he does the same thing today
[1:07:47] we're in the season of deliverance he
[1:07:49] tries to get us to focus on things that
[1:07:51] are not promised of god
[1:07:53] try oh we've got to fix this we're going
[1:07:54] to sort this listen to this advice we're
[1:07:56] going to you know sort about all these
[1:07:58] natural things they'll take care of
[1:07:59] themselves
[1:08:00] they'll take care of themselves but what
[1:08:02] are we doing with the promises in our
[1:08:04] midst right now because all those things
[1:08:06] really are is just building more bricks
[1:08:07] for pharaoh sure we've got to live in
[1:08:09] this world we need jobs we need careers
[1:08:11] get an education if you can you're all
[1:08:13] those things sure but don't let it be
[1:08:15] your all in all don't let that define
[1:08:17] you
[1:08:18] i'm not defined because i happen to work
[1:08:20] at esr that's not my who i am i'm a
[1:08:23] christian
[1:08:25] hallelujah it should be the same thing
[1:08:26] with your whatever what profession we're
[1:08:28] in
[1:08:29] that's not our identity we just happen
[1:08:31] to do that because we need to do it
[1:08:32] because we need to live but
[1:08:34] we are defined by the word of god in the
[1:08:36] word of god alone so don't let the devil
[1:08:39] putting pressure on you like that yo
[1:08:42] get your eyes off the promise
[1:08:44] because they begin to complain
[1:08:46] to to moses about this he basically they
[1:08:48] said it's your fault
[1:08:50] that that pharaohs put this burden upon
[1:08:52] us it's your fault and here was the guy
[1:08:54] seen to deliver them
[1:08:56] you know and they were all worshiping
[1:08:58] before that because moses went down with
[1:09:00] aaron and called the elders of israel
[1:09:01] did the signs they bowed their heads and
[1:09:02] worshiped but there was no pressure when
[1:09:04] that was going on it's easy to praise
[1:09:06] god when things are fine
[1:09:08] but what about keeping your eyes on the
[1:09:09] promise when things aren't fine
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:14] no that's right the problem is is israel
[1:09:18] was used to being slaves
[1:09:20] they were conditioned by their
[1:09:22] upbringing
[1:09:23] of being slaves
[1:09:25] it was it was not just them but their
[1:09:27] fathers and so on however long that 400
[1:09:29] years that's a long time of slavery
[1:09:31] that's longer than this nation was has
[1:09:33] been here and the way it is now
[1:09:35] right
[1:09:36] but so they were conditioned it was like
[1:09:38] you know that's longer than america has
[1:09:39] been america right that's a long time
[1:09:42] but you see so they were conditioned
[1:09:43] that way and the problem is as spirits
[1:09:46] become very familiar with us
[1:09:48] you know the bible speaks about familiar
[1:09:50] spirits and it speaks to people who will
[1:09:52] commune with demons and different things
[1:09:54] but i want to take it in other ways that
[1:09:56] spirits can be familiar
[1:09:58] now that spirit of slavery
[1:10:00] was familiar to the israelites they were
[1:10:02] used to it they were born under it
[1:10:04] that's how they and it made them think a
[1:10:06] certain way because when when things got
[1:10:08] hard they appealed to pharaoh pharaoh
[1:10:10] wasn't their king god was their king god
[1:10:13] was calling them out they should have
[1:10:15] appealed remember at first they appealed
[1:10:17] to god because they cried out because of
[1:10:19] their bondage then god brought the
[1:10:20] deliverer in and then they complained
[1:10:23] to pharaoh about the bondage that
[1:10:24] pharaoh is putting them under you know
[1:10:26] but because why they went to the one who
[1:10:28] they really thought was their master
[1:10:32] we never want to think this world or
[1:10:33] some demon spirit is our master
[1:10:36] right we are not here to be dictated to
[1:10:38] by satan and his devices
[1:10:41] we are not here to put up with spirits
[1:10:43] we're familiar with so spirits that
[1:10:45] we're familiar with make us think a
[1:10:47] certain way so someone who's depressed
[1:10:49] they've got a spirit of depression upon
[1:10:51] them so they think like a depressed
[1:10:53] person no one likes me i'm just unhappy
[1:10:55] no one cares about me you know and
[1:10:57] they're just all sad and down and deep
[1:10:59] and promise if you get familiar with
[1:11:01] that spirit at first it becomes a
[1:11:03] strange thing
[1:11:04] at first but then someone gets familiar
[1:11:06] with it and then they begin to identify
[1:11:08] that's me
[1:11:09] right or someone who who cannot forgive
[1:11:12] you know at first it's a shock i can't
[1:11:14] believe i can't forgive this person
[1:11:16] because that spirit's trying to become
[1:11:17] familiar with you but then
[1:11:19] if you allow it to come in more and more
[1:11:21] that's just how you think
[1:11:23] well they're wrong and they did this and
[1:11:25] how did they
[1:11:26] 50 million years ago they said that
[1:11:28] right and you know and that's all
[1:11:30] they're living through and it's why it's
[1:11:31] a spirit of unforgiveness
[1:11:33] and they become familiar with that it
[1:11:35] becomes their identity stubbornness lust
[1:11:37] or pride or whatever it may be envy
[1:11:39] gossip people get your at first it's a
[1:11:41] shocking thing because you're not used
[1:11:43] to it but then when you become familiar
[1:11:45] i mean it becomes part of who you are
[1:11:47] and the and the children of israel i
[1:11:49] mean they became that same way where
[1:11:51] that spirit of slavery
[1:11:53] they were very familiar with
[1:11:55] that's why friends we're not called
[1:11:58] we are people but we're different kind
[1:12:00] of people
[1:12:01] we're the ransomed
[1:12:02] body of jesus christ amen purchased by
[1:12:05] his blood made in his image transformed
[1:12:08] by his holy ghost we are not we are like
[1:12:10] everyone else but at the same time we're
[1:12:11] not like abraham was like anyone else
[1:12:14] but he was caught by god that's what
[1:12:15] made him different and that's the same
[1:12:17] thing with you and i god called us
[1:12:18] that's what makes us different
[1:12:20] hallelujah so you know i'm so thankful
[1:12:22] that we you know we should never well we
[1:12:25] don't need to stay with a familiar
[1:12:26] spirit
[1:12:28] that's right even if even if you see
[1:12:30] well my father was like that my
[1:12:31] grandfather or my grandmother whatever
[1:12:33] more you can see a strain in the family
[1:12:35] come down to you
[1:12:37] yeah we don't have to put up with that
[1:12:39] the blood of jesus christ is here to
[1:12:40] break
[1:12:41] to cast that out to bring deliverance
[1:12:43] amen that that the spirit of god is the
[1:12:46] one that we are familiar with
[1:12:48] he should not be some distant stranger
[1:12:51] that sends you a whatsapp every decade
[1:12:54] he should be closer than your spouse or
[1:12:56] he should be your best friend
[1:12:58] oh you're our spouse our best friend but
[1:13:00] i mean god should be our best best
[1:13:01] friend our bff
[1:13:03] hallelujah we should be very familiar
[1:13:06] with his presence
[1:13:08] not taking it for granted but we should
[1:13:09] be familiar so and then when something
[1:13:11] else comes in it should be a shock all
[1:13:13] right oh god this is not you this is
[1:13:14] funny yes i don't like this
[1:13:17] but then when when the prince of god
[1:13:18] comes around it's like lord this is home
[1:13:21] his presence should feel like home
[1:13:23] hallelujah it shouldn't be a distant
[1:13:26] funny thing that we're just not used to
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:30] hallelujah so they were slaves now i i
[1:13:33] happened to google i you know i asked mr
[1:13:34] google what's a slave and mr google said
[1:13:37] a slave is a person who is the legal
[1:13:39] property of another and is forced to
[1:13:41] obey them that's a slave
[1:13:43] so now
[1:13:44] the israelites though
[1:13:47] pharaoh considered them legal property
[1:13:50] and pharaoh considered they have to obey
[1:13:51] him
[1:13:53] that was pharaoh's mentality and that
[1:13:54] and that mentality was projected upon
[1:13:56] the israelites
[1:13:58] but they were the sons and daughters of
[1:14:00] god
[1:14:00] he says out of egypt i've called my son
[1:14:03] now he said that about jesus but he said
[1:14:04] then his lesser son was israel being
[1:14:06] called out amen so those people were
[1:14:09] never the actually the legal property
[1:14:12] sure and pharaoh's mind was one thing
[1:14:14] but in god's mind it's another so in
[1:14:16] pharaoh's mind they were his legal
[1:14:18] property and they were forced to obey
[1:14:20] him but in god's mind they were the sons
[1:14:22] his children amen they were his property
[1:14:25] i mean so now god has to transform into
[1:14:28] us
[1:14:28] his thinking about us yes
[1:14:30] the thoughts i have towards your piece
[1:14:32] you'll come to an expected end that
[1:14:34] expected end is dancing on streets of
[1:14:36] gold redeemed
[1:14:38] made in his image washed in the blood
[1:14:40] that's god's sauce towards you remember
[1:14:42] if god thought that about you and god
[1:14:43] cannot change your sinking god's mind is
[1:14:45] made up about you
[1:14:47] irrespective of up and down then and out
[1:14:49] whatever you may go like this try to
[1:14:52] walk a straight line but you'll god will
[1:14:53] get you there
[1:14:55] hallelujah have you just surrendered to
[1:14:56] his will amen remember it's not him that
[1:14:58] willeth or runneth but who god gives
[1:15:00] mercy to
[1:15:01] others if god has made up his mind about
[1:15:04] you
[1:15:04] done
[1:15:05] amen but now you've got to make up your
[1:15:07] mind about who you are amen and him amen
[1:15:11] hallelujah
[1:15:12] so now remember they were
[1:15:14] they were never meant to be they were
[1:15:16] never really pharaoh's property
[1:15:18] just like we are not the devil's
[1:15:20] property
[1:15:21] we never ever belong to him amen
[1:15:24] amen some people think well i'm just a
[1:15:25] slave to the devil no no but you're not
[1:15:28] the devil's property amen you don't
[1:15:30] belong on his side you're not mean to
[1:15:32] think like he thinks act like he acts
[1:15:34] amen because remember you know before
[1:15:37] there ever was a devil
[1:15:39] we are gods
[1:15:40] right so we never were the devils we
[1:15:42] were under his dominion once upon a time
[1:15:44] just like israel they were never
[1:15:46] pharaohs but they were under his
[1:15:47] dominion but god came to loose them from
[1:15:50] the bondage of bondage of slavery it's
[1:15:52] the same thing amen with us where the
[1:15:54] lord is here to deliver us from the
[1:15:56] bondage of a of a sin nature that we're
[1:15:58] born with
[1:15:59] hallelujah because it says in first
[1:16:01] corinthians 6 it says what know you not
[1:16:03] that your body is the temple of the holy
[1:16:05] ghost which is in you which you have of
[1:16:07] god and you are not your own for you're
[1:16:09] bought with a price therefore glorify
[1:16:11] god in your body and in your spirit with
[1:16:13] your gods now we don't become god's
[1:16:16] property by the baptism of the holy
[1:16:17] ghost just like we do not become sons
[1:16:20] and daughters of god when we receive the
[1:16:21] holy ghost it says in galatians because
[1:16:23] you are sons
[1:16:25] not because you became sons but because
[1:16:27] you are sons he sent for the spirit into
[1:16:29] your hearts will you cry abba father so
[1:16:31] it's because you are you receive the
[1:16:32] holy ghost you do not become it's
[1:16:35] because you are amen hallelujah so we
[1:16:38] have always been god's property amen
[1:16:40] amen we have always been god's property
[1:16:42] we never actually belong to the devil
[1:16:44] amen so now if we could look at it that
[1:16:47] way now i love it where where jesus was
[1:16:49] saying john 10 and 27 just just just
[1:16:51] hold with me this morning he said now my
[1:16:53] sheep hear my voice and i know them and
[1:16:55] they follow me and i will give unto them
[1:16:58] eternal life and they shall never perish
[1:17:00] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:17:02] my hand my father which gave them me is
[1:17:05] greater than all and no man is able to
[1:17:08] pluck them out of my father's hand
[1:17:10] hallelujah so there's nothing on earth
[1:17:13] or in hell that can pluck a child of god
[1:17:16] out of god's hands
[1:17:17] that means they can never truly become
[1:17:19] lost they may be like a prodigal that
[1:17:21] wanders for a season
[1:17:23] hallelujah hey we all walked in darkness
[1:17:25] the scripture says we're all like sheep
[1:17:26] gone astray
[1:17:27] says one point of our lives we all went
[1:17:29] astray
[1:17:30] that may have been in the world or maybe
[1:17:32] you started walking with god then you
[1:17:34] went australia to bring you back amen
[1:17:36] amen but if you're part of god you're
[1:17:37] going to come back to god amen maybe
[1:17:39] it's a weird so so if nothing can pluck
[1:17:41] them out of his hand we need to believe
[1:17:43] like that for our family
[1:17:45] amen even though they may be wandering
[1:17:47] in darkness somewhere we've got to
[1:17:48] believe lord they're in your hand the
[1:17:50] devil can't pluck them out amen he may
[1:17:52] be dragging around all which way but
[1:17:54] they're still yours
[1:17:55] they're still your property hallelujah
[1:17:58] why because we've got to look beyond
[1:18:00] what we see and look to the promise of
[1:18:02] god
[1:18:03] that's what we've got to keep in our
[1:18:05] forefront and our minds like if like if
[1:18:07] israel when the bricks you know yo that
[1:18:10] all got harder they just kept the
[1:18:11] promise in the forefront
[1:18:13] hallelujah they wouldn't have been
[1:18:15] complaining to to moses and to pharaoh
[1:18:17] about it maybe but they would have just
[1:18:19] been rejoicing saying we're in the
[1:18:20] seasons of season of deliverance
[1:18:23] amen amen remember children of israel
[1:18:25] never actually belong to pharaoh thou
[1:18:26] god's chosen people
[1:18:28] amen and you know
[1:18:31] we live in this time
[1:18:32] we need to realize who we are
[1:18:35] now as as slaves
[1:18:37] as slaves the children of israel were
[1:18:39] not manifesting their name
[1:18:42] because because in genesis 32 when when
[1:18:44] jacob wrestled with the angel and god
[1:18:46] changed his name to israel he says he
[1:18:49] says you'll no longer be called jacob
[1:18:51] but israel for as a prince has thou
[1:18:54] power with god and with men
[1:18:56] and has prevailed
[1:18:57] and even even the name israel just
[1:18:59] looked at the strong's it means he will
[1:19:00] rule as god
[1:19:02] that's his name
[1:19:03] so when they were slaves
[1:19:05] living well below their privilege in
[1:19:07] egypt they weren't manifesting that
[1:19:09] they're manifesting slavery
[1:19:11] right they were not ruling as god
[1:19:13] they were not having dominion like they
[1:19:15] had god given dominion right but they
[1:19:18] were living under slavery so they
[1:19:19] weren't manifesting the name of israel
[1:19:21] now we know the brightest spiritual
[1:19:23] israel
[1:19:24] hallelujah so it's time it's it's it's
[1:19:26] well time oh yes where we throw away our
[1:19:29] slave mentality remember just because
[1:19:31] israel was slaves doesn't mean they
[1:19:33] weren't god's chosen people
[1:19:34] right so they're under all kind of
[1:19:36] complexes pains and hurts and whatever
[1:19:38] more they were still god's chosen people
[1:19:40] amen so just because someone may be in
[1:19:42] that condition you may be that way this
[1:19:44] morning that does not mean you're not
[1:19:45] one of gods
[1:19:47] hallelujah so it's time it's time to
[1:19:50] rule as god upon the earth amen where
[1:19:52] every power of satan is under our feet
[1:19:55] amen that's what the baptism of the holy
[1:19:57] ghost does is put satan in his rightful
[1:19:59] place puts you in your rifle position
[1:20:01] hey once upon a time the devil was my
[1:20:03] slave master
[1:20:05] he beat me made me do all kinds of
[1:20:06] things i'd wake up with regret saying
[1:20:08] i'm never doing that again next minute i
[1:20:10] was doing it again why because that
[1:20:12] unbelief was governing my life amen but
[1:20:14] then but then god richard mercy came
[1:20:16] along
[1:20:17] satan was dethroned there was a
[1:20:19] revolution
[1:20:20] hallelujah not a reformation of trying
[1:20:22] to be a religious person but a
[1:20:23] revolution
[1:20:25] where god changed my nature filled me
[1:20:26] with the holy ghost and now those things
[1:20:29] don't even come near me no more
[1:20:31] hallelujah i'm sure the devil kicks puts
[1:20:34] all kinds of mind battles in your mind
[1:20:35] but hey if he kicks it means he's about
[1:20:37] to leave amen
[1:20:38] hallelujah
[1:20:40] i love the book of genesis you know
[1:20:43] genesis one and two there's different
[1:20:44] laws are put into put into manifestation
[1:20:47] and one of them is when god makes the
[1:20:49] day and night and he and it says that he
[1:20:51] you know let there be lights for the
[1:20:53] firmament of the heavens to give light
[1:20:54] upon the earth and it was so and god
[1:20:56] made two great lights the greater light
[1:20:58] to rule the day and the lesser uh lesser
[1:21:01] light to rule the night and he made the
[1:21:03] stars also so he gave the sun dominion
[1:21:06] over the day
[1:21:07] doesn't matter how many flashlights or
[1:21:09] cell phone lights you put on in the day
[1:21:11] time it'll never it'll never be brighter
[1:21:13] than that sun because that sun rules the
[1:21:15] day right it controls the day it
[1:21:17] controls the temperature upon the earth
[1:21:19] and different things that go on the
[1:21:21] sunlight rules the day now we know that
[1:21:24] the lesser light is the moon and the
[1:21:26] moon actually has no light in itself
[1:21:28] it's just a reflector of the sun just as
[1:21:30] the bride is a reflector we don't have
[1:21:32] our own light it's just the sunlight of
[1:21:34] god shining upon us and reflecting to
[1:21:36] the earth but god there in genesis gave
[1:21:39] gave us dominion just like the moon had
[1:21:41] dominion over the night
[1:21:43] we're living in a night season but the
[1:21:45] light is still shining shining from the
[1:21:47] son on to the bride to the to the rest
[1:21:50] of the world so he said that the moon
[1:21:52] would have dominion he never said that
[1:21:55] the darkness would have them the knight
[1:21:57] would have dominion over the moon
[1:22:00] when god puts a law in place it's there
[1:22:02] it doesn't change it doesn't change
[1:22:04] because of hashtags and different things
[1:22:06] on you know social media it stays
[1:22:08] exactly how it should be right so if god
[1:22:10] gave us dominion over the darkness amen
[1:22:13] i say lord may we take our god-given
[1:22:15] position
[1:22:16] hallelujah we're not just a little speck
[1:22:18] in the galaxy no god built us remember
[1:22:21] he built this it's not us building
[1:22:22] ourselves god built us to have dominion
[1:22:25] over the powers of darkness
[1:22:27] over unbelief over superstition over
[1:22:30] complexes over pain over lust spirits
[1:22:34] unforgiveness bitterness resentment
[1:22:36] whatever it may be pity parties pride i
[1:22:39] mean god gave us dominion that those
[1:22:41] things do not rule us but we rule them
[1:22:44] how do you rule them you cast them out
[1:22:46] you don't you don't welcome them into
[1:22:48] your house you don't welcome them into
[1:22:50] your life you don't make them a cup of
[1:22:52] tea or coffee and say sit down let's
[1:22:53] have a conversation you say we are not
[1:22:55] on speaking terms
[1:22:57] we are not i'm not here to have a
[1:22:58] conversation with you and my mind devil
[1:23:00] you're not welcome here
[1:23:02] hallelujah
[1:23:04] amen that's why we've got to we've got
[1:23:07] to get rid of
[1:23:08] familiar spirits
[1:23:10] amen depression
[1:23:12] reasoning skepticism unbelief doubt that
[1:23:15] can become part of someone but that's
[1:23:17] not the spirit of god amen aiming
[1:23:20] criticism sure ain't the spirit of god
[1:23:22] lust ain't the spirit of god and those
[1:23:24] are all familiar spirits that we are not
[1:23:26] ordained amen to have
[1:23:29] but the spirit of god is the one we
[1:23:31] should be familiar with and his spirit
[1:23:34] will cause you to believe the word that
[1:23:36] it's for you
[1:23:37] not just oh yeah those promises are true
[1:23:39] but for someone else no the promises are
[1:23:41] all mine my brother isaac was all over
[1:23:44] my notes last night a bit saying really
[1:23:46] a christian's all about what's for me
[1:23:49] every promise is mine
[1:23:51] and that's the only way you can help
[1:23:52] someone else to say lord where's all my
[1:23:54] promises
[1:23:55] you purchase them i want them lay hold
[1:23:57] upon every promise in the bible they're
[1:23:59] yours he died he died that you would
[1:24:01] receive them
[1:24:02] hallelujah so if it's my property i want
[1:24:05] it
[1:24:06] i just want to hear about it i want it
[1:24:08] hallelujah amen
[1:24:10] amen his spirit will amen his own word
[1:24:13] in your life
[1:24:15] that it's for you amen it won't be oh
[1:24:17] yeah but this person did this and this
[1:24:18] and this and this no no no that's not
[1:24:20] the spirit of god the spirit of god says
[1:24:22] amen it's for me thank you lord
[1:24:24] amen you see caleb caleb was maybe very
[1:24:27] familiar with the spirit of slavery
[1:24:29] because he was born under that spirit
[1:24:32] but that all changed when the light
[1:24:33] struck the lands hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:36] that all changed when he realized it was
[1:24:38] more than moses giving promises but it
[1:24:40] was god god stepped down and was
[1:24:42] speaking through moses that'll change
[1:24:44] his life the slave mentality just went
[1:24:47] that spirit of slavery
[1:24:49] slavery left
[1:24:51] amen as as moses would say of caleb
[1:24:54] numbers 14 and 20 23-24 says surely thou
[1:24:58] shalt not see the land which i swear
[1:25:00] unto their fathers neither shall any of
[1:25:01] them that provoked me see it but my
[1:25:04] servant caleb because he had another
[1:25:06] spirit with him
[1:25:08] what was that another spirit that wasn't
[1:25:10] a different spirit of slavery that was
[1:25:12] the spirit of christ
[1:25:14] because he said we're more than able
[1:25:15] let's go right now let's go right now
[1:25:18] and get that land god has given us the
[1:25:20] land i know i've even picked out where
[1:25:22] i'm living i want to live there and he
[1:25:24] picked a place where the other there's a
[1:25:26] stronghold of the enemy he says i want
[1:25:27] that view
[1:25:28] i want that place do you care about the
[1:25:30] giants no because god says it's mine i
[1:25:33] want that one
[1:25:34] hallelujah and and then he spent the
[1:25:36] next i think 44 years because he 40
[1:25:38] years in the wilderness i think four he
[1:25:40] was 84 when um you know i think about
[1:25:42] that when he actually got the promise
[1:25:43] but then he says to joshua after they've
[1:25:45] been taking the land says give me my
[1:25:47] mountain
[1:25:48] i'm as strong today as i was then give
[1:25:52] me what's mine i saw it 40 odd years ago
[1:25:55] i just don't want to talk about it
[1:25:56] anymore yo there comes a time where we
[1:25:58] go from just talking about the promise
[1:26:00] to possessing the promise holy there
[1:26:02] comes a time where it's actually not
[1:26:04] just a great hey it would have been
[1:26:05] awesome imagine imagine the atmosphere
[1:26:07] in his tent every night
[1:26:09] atmosphere of faith
[1:26:11] dad tell us about the promised land
[1:26:13] again
[1:26:14] tell us about the mountain again
[1:26:16] tell us about the grapes and the
[1:26:18] different things and where we're going
[1:26:19] to live and what's the view like and
[1:26:21] he'd say children
[1:26:23] i was a slave
[1:26:25] you can see my back there's the marks
[1:26:26] they're real we just weren't
[1:26:28] hypothetical slaves we're real slaves
[1:26:31] but moses came see that man over there
[1:26:33] he came glory and god used him in a
[1:26:36] mighty way
[1:26:37] and here we are we've been here 40 years
[1:26:39] but you know when i went to land with
[1:26:41] joshua we just got excited
[1:26:43] we just got excited
[1:26:45] because we were just coming out we were
[1:26:47] going in
[1:26:48] we were just coming out of the world now
[1:26:49] we're going into every divine promise of
[1:26:51] god and we just got so excited and we
[1:26:54] were playing that game that's mine the
[1:26:55] first one to say it was theirs you know
[1:26:57] how you know kids drive along my car
[1:26:59] your car my house your house
[1:27:01] sorry that sounds a bit ridiculous but
[1:27:03] you know you should like claim to
[1:27:04] everything you see in the world well i
[1:27:06] shouldn't be oh that's for that person
[1:27:07] no it's mine
[1:27:08] if you want to share it come join that's
[1:27:10] good but it's mine
[1:27:12] hallelujah so he'd begin to tell that
[1:27:14] and it would have generated faith in the
[1:27:15] home amen
[1:27:17] the other ones who didn't believe they
[1:27:18] were just would have been complaining
[1:27:19] about sand and trouble and whatever more
[1:27:22] and caleb and joshua they had the same
[1:27:23] stand in trouble
[1:27:25] right but they weren't looking at that
[1:27:27] they were looking beyond amen
[1:27:29] they're looking beyond to where they are
[1:27:31] their final destination
[1:27:33] hallelujah and we should look beyond the
[1:27:36] sand and trouble in life
[1:27:37] right we should look beyond those things
[1:27:39] look to the promise because remember
[1:27:41] remember
[1:27:42] doubt and worry never delivered anyone
[1:27:46] never we could take everyone if i could
[1:27:48] resurrect everyone from adam
[1:27:50] chronologically all the way down now we
[1:27:51] could ask them did did that worry help
[1:27:53] you
[1:27:55] it'd be no
[1:27:56] they'd take a while to do that but you
[1:27:57] know that would be the
[1:27:59] how'd that anxiety help you didn't help
[1:28:01] me none but then when the believer comes
[1:28:03] i'll say how did faith help you yes
[1:28:05] hallelujah faith delivered me
[1:28:08] faith brought down enemies brought the
[1:28:09] dead back to life again conquered
[1:28:12] conquered nations hallelujah heal the
[1:28:14] sick rose of death faith deliver me
[1:28:16] faith help me amen
[1:28:18] that's why we should never let
[1:28:19] complaining weaken our faith
[1:28:21] we should always be positive confession
[1:28:24] god is more than able doesn't matter
[1:28:26] what i see no matter what i hear now
[1:28:28] what i'm told i believe lord your word
[1:28:30] is true amen and you're here to fulfill
[1:28:32] it in my life
[1:28:34] hallelujah
[1:28:35] so caleb had a different spirit with him
[1:28:38] and it's i'm going to finish that verse
[1:28:40] and hath followed me fully him will i
[1:28:42] bring him to the land where unto he he
[1:28:44] went and his seed shall possess it what
[1:28:46] a promise
[1:28:47] i mean what you know we're a bunch of
[1:28:48] calebs
[1:28:50] we're a bunch of caleb's we're going to
[1:28:51] possess every divine promise because god
[1:28:54] is calling for it it wasn't just k
[1:28:56] remember whatever's got whatever's going
[1:28:58] on in here that's of god it was in god
[1:29:00] before it was in here
[1:29:02] right there's a deep calling to the deep
[1:29:05] amen so if there's a longing for the
[1:29:06] promise of god god wants to give you
[1:29:08] that promise because the deepest calling
[1:29:11] to the deep
[1:29:12] hallelujah it's not just in your mind a
[1:29:14] nice idea there's a longing lord there's
[1:29:16] got to be more to you than this lord i
[1:29:17] want that promise i've read in the word
[1:29:19] because it's the season god wants to
[1:29:21] give it to you
[1:29:22] that's not just us saying all this is
[1:29:24] going on you know there's been a
[1:29:25] swarming going on
[1:29:27] there's been excitement around the world
[1:29:29] hallelujah all the all the children
[1:29:31] god's children gathering together
[1:29:34] church walls are busted down we're all
[1:29:35] one big family what's that there's a
[1:29:37] swarming going on why because we're
[1:29:39] about to take a flight
[1:29:40] hallelujah what's dictating the flight
[1:29:43] it's the season
[1:29:44] it's god
[1:29:46] it's not it's not the ducks hello ducks
[1:29:48] how are you
[1:29:49] you know
[1:29:50] it's the season that we're in hallelujah
[1:29:53] just like it was god and caleb saying
[1:29:55] that's yours
[1:29:56] and then he says i want it because it's
[1:29:58] mine what was telling him that god was
[1:29:59] telling him
[1:30:01] amen if god can lead you to believe the
[1:30:03] promise of god it's yours when it's
[1:30:05] revealed to it's yours see it's yours
[1:30:07] hallelujah but you see you've got to
[1:30:09] hate the enemy then you can be free from
[1:30:11] him that's right you can never be free
[1:30:13] from an evil spirit that you enjoy
[1:30:16] you will never be free you worship it
[1:30:18] but if you hate that if you hate that
[1:30:19] spirit of depression you can be free
[1:30:22] from if you enjoy thinking like that
[1:30:23] then you won't be free or that spirit of
[1:30:25] lust or unforgiveness business criticism
[1:30:28] whatever if you enjoy that right then
[1:30:30] you cannot be free but you've got to
[1:30:31] hate that enemy enough then you can be
[1:30:34] set free see we've got to have a
[1:30:36] mentality that would rather die as free
[1:30:39] men and women than live as a slave
[1:30:42] that's how we should be i'd rather die
[1:30:44] as a free man amen
[1:30:46] then live as a slave amen yeah i think i
[1:30:48] said it a while ago i googled i heard i
[1:30:50] think brother ron spencer mentioned it
[1:30:51] so i googled that um
[1:30:53] the the percentage of taxation that the
[1:30:56] british uh the
[1:30:57] the american colonists were under when
[1:30:59] the revolution happened in america and
[1:31:02] it was between 1 and 1.5 percent
[1:31:04] taxation
[1:31:05] and it vexed them so much
[1:31:07] they had a revolution
[1:31:09] so
[1:31:10] i just bring into spiritual terms
[1:31:11] because who cares about the economy it
[1:31:13] can all be gone tomorrow we can walk out
[1:31:15] of these doors look at our phone in this
[1:31:16] and this whole nation's collapsed
[1:31:19] sri lanka's gone
[1:31:20] other ones are falling
[1:31:22] oh but we live here no we're just the
[1:31:24] same it's a global village so if one
[1:31:26] part is burning we're all on fire
[1:31:28] right but but we're not here to live
[1:31:30] don't get caught up in those things we
[1:31:32] have a divine promise of god amen
[1:31:34] amen so so if we just take that into the
[1:31:37] spiritual now between one percent they
[1:31:39] were they were so vexed just by one
[1:31:42] percent of 1.5 percent of the devil
[1:31:44] the devil taking that much of their life
[1:31:46] it vex them so much
[1:31:48] that they are willing to give their
[1:31:50] lives i think was in patrick henry or
[1:31:51] one of them said give me liberty or give
[1:31:53] me death
[1:31:54] he was determined a lot of those
[1:31:56] founding fathers that signed that
[1:31:57] declaration of independence gave their
[1:31:59] lives they were captured by the british
[1:32:01] tortured lost everything many were very
[1:32:04] wealthy people and they lost it all in
[1:32:05] that wall one of them um one of them
[1:32:08] actually has his estate or his house was
[1:32:10] captured by the british and there was
[1:32:12] cornwallis or one of the generals was
[1:32:14] using it as his headquarters and that

[1:32:47] revolution if they were that in the
[1:32:49] natural how about the bride of christ we

[1:33:12] if people were so vexed by a little bit
[1:33:14] of taxation how much more you and i we
[1:33:17] don't want to be i trust that the
[1:33:18] natural doesn't type the spiritual where

[1:33:42] back and tell ourselves our own
[1:33:44] testimony to remember
[1:33:45] we need to give ourselves a good
[1:33:47] testimony meaning with ourselves you
[1:33:49] need to look in the mirror and tell
[1:33:50] yourself your testimony why because that
[1:33:53] takes slave mentality off that takes
[1:33:55] because the devil doesn't try and wear
[1:33:56] us down but we're not here to be worn
[1:33:58] down we're here to walk free but if he
[1:34:00] can wear you down you begin to forget
[1:34:02] who you are you become double-minded you
[1:34:05] become unstable in all your ways because
[1:34:06] you forget what god has done
[1:34:09] amen you need to tell even if he just
[1:34:10] called you you felt convicted that's god
[1:34:13] that's a supernatural thing
[1:34:16] that's that
[1:34:17] the greatest miracle you'll ever see is
[1:34:19] a transformed life full of the holy
[1:34:21] ghost

[1:34:29] the power of god heal control the
[1:34:30] weather all different things but the
[1:34:32] greatest thing is when you see a person
[1:34:35] really born again by the spirit of god
[1:34:37] amen so because brother brown says on on
[1:34:40] that day on calvary what does calvary

[1:35:18] you

[1:35:21] darkness into light
[1:35:22] it wasn't us that decided no god did it
[1:35:24] for you
[1:35:25] hallelujah
[1:35:27] amen and why did he do it because it's
[1:35:28] like out of egypt i've called my son out
[1:35:30] of the world i've called my bride
[1:35:33] hallelujah
[1:35:35] hallelujah now what i love about the
[1:35:37] time of exodus is moses was equipped
[1:35:40] to conquer every every thing the pharaoh
[1:35:43] could throw at him before and all the
[1:35:45] pressures before it ever happened
[1:35:48] before it ever happened he was fully
[1:35:49] equipped
[1:35:50] brother ram said that moses
[1:35:53] uh you know moses after god had given
[1:35:55] him 40 years more of teaching 80 years
[1:35:57] old could you imagine how ridiculous to
[1:35:59] the carnal mind that would be here was
[1:36:01] moses in the presence of the burning
[1:36:03] bush was better equipped in five minutes
[1:36:05] in the presence of god than 80 years
[1:36:07] schooling that he had
[1:36:08] so 40 years in the in the egyptians and
[1:36:11] he was schooled on the back slide of the
[1:36:12] desert his brother ahmad said on
[1:36:14] wednesday
[1:36:15] but those eight years five minutes in
[1:36:17] the presence of the burning bush
[1:36:19] did more for him equipped them prepared
[1:36:22] and better than all that 80 years of his
[1:36:24] life
[1:36:25] and you know you know we can come into
[1:36:27] this that same presence this morning
[1:36:29] where the burning bush can step down
[1:36:31] into our presence and god can speak to
[1:36:33] you and equip you better than all of
[1:36:35] your life all your theology all your
[1:36:36] criticism whatever more and equip you
[1:36:39] for the battle that you're gonna face
[1:36:41] hallelujah that same god still visits
[1:36:43] and equips his people the same way what
[1:36:45] is it it's a supernatural visitation
[1:36:47] where god remember he was he was he
[1:36:49] moses actually was actually he got used
[1:36:52] to living well below his privilege
[1:36:55] he was god's predestinated ordained
[1:36:58] deliverer
[1:36:59] and he was growing
[1:37:01] and and and where was he he ran ran from
[1:37:04] his calling
[1:37:05] raising his family on the back side of
[1:37:07] the desert and that was that he just
[1:37:09] thought that's my lot
[1:37:11] but god said no
[1:37:13] you may think that's your lot
[1:37:15] you may think unbelief is your light and
[1:37:17] just living this way is your life but
[1:37:18] then god says no there's a season where
[1:37:20] it's going to change
[1:37:22] hallelujah and god visited him and
[1:37:24] called him out and we could get used to
[1:37:26] well i'm just never going to get free of
[1:37:27] this thing i'm never going to overcome
[1:37:29] this thing i'm just going to be this way
[1:37:30] the whole time no
[1:37:32] no god is here
[1:37:34] for a total liberty
[1:37:37] amen
[1:37:39] god is here for a total total liberty

[1:38:08] and religion whatever more you don't you

[1:38:18] hallelujah amen the spirit and we know
[1:38:21] adoption is the placing of a son or

[1:39:27] this and we in jesus christ by spiritual
[1:39:29] baptism not by water by spirit we are
[1:39:31] baptized into one body which is christ
[1:39:34] the worshiping place then being in there
[1:39:36] we being on this ground it's like the
[1:39:38] abstract deed you say i bought a piece
[1:39:40] of ground it isn't yours yet until you
[1:39:42] got an abstract but if you've got an
[1:39:45] abstract it shows that everything that
[1:39:46] was ever against this piece of ground
[1:39:48] has been striking off
[1:39:50] and when you become a christian
[1:39:52] and accept christ as your savior then
[1:39:54] when god sends down the abstract which
[1:39:56] is the baptism of the holy ghost it
[1:39:58] shows no matter what your father did
[1:40:01] what your mother did what anyone else
[1:40:02] did your mother daddy might have been
[1:40:05] drunkards prostitutes whatever it was
[1:40:07] every sin is stricken off you've got an
[1:40:09] abstract title there's nothing can put

[1:40:21] by the baptism of the holy ghost every
[1:40:23] gift of god belongs in the church amen
[1:40:25] it's an abstract title deed it's yours
[1:40:27] it belongs to you it quickens your
[1:40:29] mortal bodies oh my if we think of it
[1:40:32] let us take a look at those faithful
[1:40:33] ones at pentecost they were all in the
[1:40:35] upper room there and they was all scared
[1:40:38] they had they had the title all right
[1:40:39] but that was afraid and all at once
[1:40:41] there came a sound from heaven the
[1:40:43] abstract came down to them like a
[1:40:44] rushing mighty wind filled all the house
[1:40:46] where they were sitting and they were so
[1:40:48] quick and
[1:40:49] that till all their cowardness one of
[1:40:51] them was afraid they even denied
[1:40:54] um that even tonight he wasn't a
[1:40:55] pharisee it wasn't a sadducee yet but
[1:40:57] when the holy ghost fell and baptized
[1:40:59] them into jesus christ he became flesh
[1:41:01] of his flesh bone of his bone word of
[1:41:03] his word he was a new creation he was a
[1:41:05] new person it quickened his body look at
[1:41:07] what it did and what it does to you when
[1:41:09] it comes in it doesn't make you go out
[1:41:12] and say i'm a methodist i'm a baptist oh
[1:41:14] i know i ought to smoke i want to do
[1:41:16] this i want to wear those kind of
[1:41:18] clothes i want to do this i or i ought
[1:41:20] to do that it's so quick and you till
[1:41:22] you have to do it it quickens your
[1:41:25] mortal body i mean so when you receive
[1:41:27] the holy ghost every promise is yours

[1:41:33] promise is yours why not go in and
[1:41:35] possess it amen hallelujah amen now

[1:42:21] leaving anything that is ours everyone's
[1:42:24] coming with us if they can't walk we're
[1:42:26] gonna pack them amen we're not leaving
[1:42:28] one hoof behind that was his
[1:42:30] determination he wasn't there just to

[1:42:34] deliverance 80 deliverance 100
[1:42:36] deliverance

[1:46:59] honest we do really what the best thing
[1:47:01] is
[1:47:02] so why aren't we there
[1:47:05] i wasn't raised in this
[1:47:07] god found me that's right oh he found me
[1:47:09] so if this is if this is if there's
[1:47:11] nothing to this why am i here
[1:47:13] hallelujah but there's everything to
[1:47:15] this
[1:47:16] maybe if god has called us out there
[1:47:17] more well let's let's just keep pressing
[1:47:19] on so we're here see sickness comes in
[1:47:21] trouble comes in you make it feel real
[1:47:23] unwelcome in your home
[1:47:26] you begin to pray you mean yo because
[1:47:27] it's the spirit that comes in you pray
[1:47:29] you begin to worship god comes down
[1:47:33] the devil hates the anointing of god it
[1:47:35] makes him shake in his boots
[1:47:37] he trembles when the anointing comes in
[1:47:40] hallelujah brother abraham said that the
[1:47:42] devil got into the car then one day he
[1:47:44] says well i'm going to sink you all the
[1:47:45] way
[1:47:47] and he begin to sing
[1:47:48] yeah because remember the devil
[1:47:50] sometimes we think well i need to be
[1:47:52] void of the enemy then i can really
[1:47:53] worship but the bible says he sets the
[1:47:55] table before me the prince of my enemies
[1:47:58] right so
[1:47:59] it seems a strange thing to me where you
[1:48:01] would invite someone that you don't want
[1:48:03] but you're going to buy them to a feast
[1:48:04] you're going to come watch me eat devil
[1:48:06] oh
[1:48:07] you know that's a bit of an odd odd
[1:48:08] thing but that's what god wants to do
[1:48:10] because god if god wants to prove the
[1:48:12] power of his blood
[1:48:13] he wants to prove it in your life that's
[1:48:15] why that's why it's not well in the
[1:48:16] millennium i'll shout and praise god or
[1:48:18] when i get no no it's now because what
[1:48:20] you are here is what you'll be there
[1:48:22] i'll have victory one day no now's the
[1:48:24] day of victory but when this body's
[1:48:26] changed then i'll be able to overcome it
[1:48:27] no no you ever come now
[1:48:29] right now you don't have to put up with
[1:48:31] this thing ruling your life
[1:48:33] amen because the blood of jesus christ
[1:48:35] cleanses from all sin puts a new nature
[1:48:36] and your holy ghost steps in
[1:48:38] and changes your life
[1:48:40] hallelujah so we shouldn't settle for
[1:48:42] anything less
[1:48:45] amen we're here to plague his kingdom
[1:48:48] others and why christ speak he says now
[1:48:49] notice this how beautiful i love this
[1:48:52] you know finally pharaoh said get out
[1:48:54] see they came to a point get out of this
[1:48:56] place they were so tormented they
[1:48:58] couldn't put up with it anymore all the
[1:48:59] plagues and trouble he said just get out
[1:49:02] god just plagued them with the voice of
[1:49:03] moses
[1:49:05] god wants to plague the devil with your
[1:49:07] voice you've got to address your enemy
[1:49:10] it's not please mr devil can you no
[1:49:12] satan you listen to me you listen to me
[1:49:14] you're not the boss around here
[1:49:16] your own belief is not welcome in this
[1:49:18] house
[1:49:19] your filthy unbelieving ways are not
[1:49:22] welcome in my mind
[1:49:23] this may be the battleground but why
[1:49:25] does it have to be like always a pushing
[1:49:27] back and pushing forward this should be
[1:49:30] like in world war one they set up
[1:49:31] trenches and things that that that
[1:49:33] what's called in like in the military a
[1:49:35] depth of defense where it's actually
[1:49:37] just a killing zone for the enemy
[1:49:40] this is what this should be in a way
[1:49:42] it shouldn't be the devil comes in just
[1:49:43] sets up his camp and just rules our
[1:49:45] lives that's where the devil comes in
[1:49:47] and we just blast him away with the word
[1:49:49] so i'm not familiar with you devil i
[1:49:51] just this thinking is foreign to me this
[1:49:54] is not a familiar spirit amen
[1:49:56] amen that's how it should be and we cast
[1:49:58] them out
[1:49:59] hallelujah
[1:50:01] amen god just plagued them with the
[1:50:03] voice of moses
[1:50:05] amen he struck everything he done
[1:50:06] everything there was to be done i mean
[1:50:08] he put the sun down the middle of the
[1:50:09] day he done everything he blackened the
[1:50:11] days he brought frogs flies lice
[1:50:13] everything else fire smoke death was to
[1:50:16] the families everything else he'd done
[1:50:17] everything till finally pharaoh had to
[1:50:19] say get out
[1:50:20] take all you got and go oh praise be to
[1:50:23] god
[1:50:24] then he says i'm so glad that a man can
[1:50:26] so completely serve god till the devil
[1:50:28] don't know what to do with them that's
[1:50:30] why i just obeyed god so completely till
[1:50:32] the devil said oh my get away i don't
[1:50:34] want to hear it no more that's right you
[1:50:36] can do it so completely hallelujah amen
[1:50:39] amen so we can so completely serve god
[1:50:41] be surrendered to him that the devil
[1:50:42] doesn't know what to do with us and it
[1:50:44] vexes him so much he just says now get
[1:50:46] out
[1:50:47] he's going to be relieved when this
[1:50:48] rapture goes
[1:50:50] the devil's going to be oh finally those
[1:50:52] people that caused me so much trouble
[1:50:54] i came against him i stumbled and fell i
[1:50:56] said another spirit had failed
[1:50:58] do you imagine what you know what hell
[1:51:00] is like
[1:51:01] when the devil sets an assignment
[1:51:03] against you
[1:51:05] and the devils once upon a time said
[1:51:06] well that's an easy job that's like a
[1:51:08] that's like a
[1:51:09] you know a working holiday all right
[1:51:11] it's easy to knock those ones around
[1:51:14] but then god stepped in
[1:51:15] and that same spirit comes against you
[1:51:17] it comes with broken limbs busted up
[1:51:20] face comes down into hell staggers into
[1:51:22] the work room what happened to you
[1:51:25] well i got sent to so-and-so's house and
[1:51:27] then the devil says okay the spirit go
[1:51:29] there no i'm not going hey man i'm not
[1:51:31] gone you know what happened last time
[1:51:33] i've still got this body cast on satan i
[1:51:35] can't do it
[1:51:36] you know
[1:51:38] it should be such a vexation to the
[1:51:39] devil that he trembles even at the
[1:51:41] thought of coming against you because of
[1:51:43] the god that's within you
[1:51:46] hallelujah amen so when this rapture
[1:51:49] goes he's going to be real happy that
[1:51:51] we're gone
[1:51:52] because there's no opposing force
[1:51:54] anymore in the gentile world
[1:51:56] that will stop him doing what he wants
[1:51:58] to do the devil thinks he can run free
[1:52:00] reign but then he comes against you you
[1:52:01] know goliath had a string of victory
[1:52:03] until he came against david and david
[1:52:05] was predestinated anointed of god aiming
[1:52:08] to kill goliath goliath was on his
[1:52:10] rampage as a shepherd boy anointed
[1:52:13] ordained to tear that giant down
[1:52:16] hallelujah that's the same thing with
[1:52:17] you and i the devil can fight all the
[1:52:19] way through whole bunch of people
[1:52:21] nations everything but then he comes
[1:52:22] against a predestinated son or daughter
[1:52:24] of god
[1:52:25] that giant's coming down
[1:52:27] amen so we shouldn't cower remember the
[1:52:30] devil may have a track history but god's
[1:52:32] got to track history too
[1:52:35] hallelujah and my god is always greater
[1:52:37] than him
[1:52:39] so don't be intimidated by the devil say
[1:52:41] well this is just how it is it's in the
[1:52:42] family we're stuck with this who said
[1:52:45] that's right david just said who's this
[1:52:47] guy
[1:52:48] he's uncircumcised who's this
[1:52:50] uncircumcised philistine basically
[1:52:51] saying i said i think last week who's
[1:52:53] this one who has no covenant with god
[1:52:56] and we have a covenant with god we're
[1:52:58] god's people he's coming to our land and
[1:53:00] why is no one fighting him
[1:53:03] amen it should be the same thing with
[1:53:04] you and i
[1:53:05] the devil doesn't have a covenant with
[1:53:07] god that's good
[1:53:09] the only promise god made is i'm going
[1:53:10] to destroy you that was his promise
[1:53:12] right but he gave a covenant with us
[1:53:15] saying you'll be the head and not the
[1:53:16] tail
[1:53:17] i mean in my name you'll cast out demons
[1:53:19] right you have a peace to pass all
[1:53:20] understanding you'll be made in my image
[1:53:22] giant speakable full of glory amen
[1:53:24] that's the covenant he made with you
[1:53:26] that when he sees you he sees himself
[1:53:29] hallelujah he says the word made flesh
[1:53:31] so now why should we put up with
[1:53:32] anything but total deliverance amen amen
[1:53:35] amen amen if we're here to plague
[1:53:38] satan's kingdom
[1:53:39] i say this stop letting him plague you
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:43] you say well the pressure's on it's just
[1:53:45] bricks and straw
[1:53:46] it's just bricks and straw don't be
[1:53:48] don't be sidetracked by those things
[1:53:50] keep your eyes on the promise of god
[1:53:53] keep your eyes on the promise because
[1:53:54] this is the season of deliverance
[1:53:57] the more the devil kicks the closer he
[1:53:59] is to being cast out
[1:54:02] it's a principle so the worse it gets
[1:54:04] the greater it is
[1:54:05] hallelujah
[1:54:07] so the more you say that's so like
[1:54:09] opposite because you think surely if the
[1:54:11] devil's doing nothing then we rejoice no
[1:54:12] no the more he does the more praises we
[1:54:15] should give god
[1:54:16] because he's on his way out
[1:54:18] right and he puts pressure on you
[1:54:20] because you're actually walking out you
[1:54:21] know they were built for an exodus the
[1:54:23] israelites were built for that exodus
[1:54:24] we're built for a rapture
[1:54:26] right we're not built to be slaves down
[1:54:28] here we're built for a rapture i mean so
[1:54:30] if we're built for this rapture we
[1:54:31] should keep that promise around us
[1:54:33] saying no we're not leaving one hoof
[1:54:34] behind me we can pray until the devil
[1:54:37] has to give in
[1:54:38] right for our family for our loved ones
[1:54:39] whoever it may be amen if god has
[1:54:42] revealed you their coming hallelujah
[1:54:45] praise him and give him give him glory
[1:54:48] his word says the promise unto you and
[1:54:50] to your children those who are far off
[1:54:52] as many as the lord our god shall call
[1:54:54] so someone can be so the children the
[1:54:55] holy ghost is for them i'm in acts
[1:54:57] chapter two
[1:54:58] those that are far off so i'm going to
[1:54:59] be far away from god they can be living
[1:55:01] in the same house as you but they'll be
[1:55:02] far away from god it's for them
[1:55:05] and this means the lord our god shall
[1:55:06] call so the promise worked on you
[1:55:09] it'll work on them
[1:55:10] hallelujah so don't look at the bricks
[1:55:12] and the straw what they're acting up the
[1:55:14] devil and what he's doing look at the
[1:55:16] promise keep the promise for you say
[1:55:17] lord your promise is a yay amen
[1:55:20] amen we don't look at what we see
[1:55:23] and bring plagues down a pot remember
[1:55:25] moses i just i just finished with this
[1:55:27] moses rod turned into a serpent
[1:55:30] and on the pharaoh's crown a part of it
[1:55:32] was a cobra
[1:55:33] remember he was a god of you know
[1:55:35] pharaoh was considered god over that
[1:55:37] nation and so moses went in the first
[1:55:39] sign he did is is dropped his staff down
[1:55:41] on the ground or aaron did it turn into
[1:55:42] the serpent and he picked up it turned
[1:55:45] into a staff
[1:55:47] and god was actually telling satan i can
[1:55:49] bind you i can loose you i can bind you
[1:55:52] it's not you that says now i'm going to
[1:55:53] cause trouble now no i can bind you i
[1:55:56] can loose you
[1:55:58] as much as i want to and that power
[1:56:01] is in you
[1:56:03] amen you combine the devil
[1:56:05] you can loose the devil you can bind
[1:56:07] them it's not member the moon rules the
[1:56:10] darkness amen rules the night amen it's
[1:56:13] not the other way around
[1:56:15] so it's not the devil ruling us no we
[1:56:16] have dominion over him but god wants you
[1:56:19] to open your lips
[1:56:21] and speak to your enemy
[1:56:23] amen let's have the musicians this
