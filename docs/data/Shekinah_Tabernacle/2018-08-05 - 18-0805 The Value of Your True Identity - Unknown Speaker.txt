TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so on the sunday school the lesson today is about Samson I know this because I'm married to the Sunday school teacher so I'm not sure the whole theme of it but I know that this morning at about 8 o'clock Shannon was getting on who gumboots and walking down into the bush down the bank by our house looking for a jawbone of a not quite a mule but a cow you know because Samson had a jawbone and he defeated his enemies with the jawbone but about a year ago one of our cows had an unfortunate incident where fell down the bank and rolled down this big bank and basically he died at the bottom of the bank it was about a year ago and so he thought ah there's a jawbone down here say I think they've got a helmet in the air and that's what the banging is is there's a jawbone being smashed on a helmet she was going to use my son some he goes quick hunting and he hears you know they think I'm a big strong hunting when they catch a pig and they take the jaw and they put it up on the front of the house you know because they caught the pig she wanted to use that to smash the helmet but Dave's his trophy jaws so he wouldn't be here but you know in the story the door never broke as a jawbone of him it was basically a piece of bone but but Samson used that for hours and it never broke so maybe David's jawbone may have been fine but I like that story you know people paint Samson like he's a big strong muscly guy and like he's got the ability to defeat his enemies naturally bit brother branham said he wasn't he was it he was a he didn't look like a strongmen and because it wasn't actually him it was the power of God and him they took over that could achieve the things that he could achieve and that's the same in our life yeah we're nothing great really we're nothing great but it's when it's when the Lord takes over our life is when we achieve anything that's that's where all the power is us we as human beings are very very I don't want to put us down because we are significant in the eyes of God but the ability we have to progress anything is very very small when you think about the output we can do the power that we have to actually do anything we're pretty limited really we're very limited but the power of God as such an abundance and if we have him for us that's why Paul says of God before us who can be against us any minute so let's um let's stand and we'll you know what I'm gonna ask brother Chris if he would open and prayer for us this morning come up the front here brother and we'll who knows brother crusty Brown he knows brother Chris let's have him open and

appreciate you all just feel the love amongst us we're just so grateful for what the Lord is doing in this day freakin I'm turn to Philippines I've got three scripture readings that I would like to take before you can have your seat so Philippians chapter 2 verses five the scripture says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross became obedient unto death and it's the same we need to become obedient to death to ourselves and we do to die to us all nature herself and lay down our lives Oh what we were born with and given into Christ's hands and then also in Romans 8:28 very familiar portions of scripture this morning Romans 8:28 read a few verses there and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us I mean they just won lost those short scripture reading from 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 and verses 17 second Corinthians 5:17 as his therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new it's just our heads for rid of three precious heavenly Father o Lord God any man can stand here and read your word can turn back the pages of a Bible and read scripture at all but but all God be fully dependent on your Holy Spirit this man to bring inspiration upon this word all all oh god I just want to come and heal my vessel afresh to you this morning hello God that you administer Lord you know the needs of the hearts of your children Hall oh god I don't know them I don't live with him day by day law but you do you see what happens law behind closed doors you know father the intimate --mess of their relationship with you Lord and I pray father that you administer this morning to each heart to each desire Lord you know touch your hearts of your boat your precious bride this morning hello god I lay myself aside and available for you to use take preeminence this morning well O God if there is any evil spirit that will want to come up against your word this morning I pray you bond and in the name of Jesus Christ Lord just take my complexes and my own abilities and put that aside this morning you just use the gift in my life lord I thank you so much for your presence and your anointing here this morning without that Lord it's a dreaded place to be without that anointing without you coming to anoint this would bless each one this morning in Jesus Christ's name I have you seats this morning we can put up that first slide so I just want to take a little topic this morning on the value of your true identity a value of knowing who you really are and what God thinks of you it's not about how poor Nana how big and how long the tick's may be but it's the value that that has in your life the value that the Scriptures have to you personally that's what it is it's not how long I can minister how long you can pray on how eloquent your speeches and all these things it's not about it it's about its value that you have of that relationship and what it means you so just the meaning of that word value sure you can all see that this morning I'm gonna use a few slides as I go through there's gonna be a bit of reading of scriptures and quotes as we go today so I trust it'll be okay with you all meeting or failures the regard that someone is held to deserve the importance the worth or usefulness of something principles or standards of behavior one's judgment of what is important in life so we put a certain value on something depending on its importance it has to you in life the estimate monetary value so it could have a monetary value of its and you away that's this item abides by its value consider to be important or beneficiary beneficial have a high opinion of so the value that you place on something is because you know it's value and what it means to you you know it's cost to get there but we can all have an object we can all see an object so if I have this bottle of water over here to you might not mean an awful lot but to me standing your ministry I might need a drink of water it has a high importance to me now than what it does to many of you so it's just basically where we put our emphasis on and what our importance is to you in your personal walk with the Lord what is important in your day-to-day life that's what it's about brother Branham talks about that story about a little boy that found its stem it all stamped that he hadn't hear it in his mind he wants an ice cream oh no he's think oh maybe he could sell this little stem and buy an ice cream that's what value he placed on that little stem if he wanted something just temporary that will make him happy and feel good but he went tied me down to the old stem collector the prophet talks about that in a message to her got the story from he says it and he looked over at the stood the stem collector knowing it was a very valuable stem so now we see someone else it has a different perspective of this little piece of paper he knows it's a girl in a greater failure once this little boy might have so he wins and he says he will give him a dollar for their stamp and it was a quick sale to a boy because it's a home now you combine ten or twenty or thirty ice creams with this amount of money it's now I got a lot more than what he thought he would get so here was a quick sale and the profit just goes on it says that he's then that went on to be sold for fifty dollars to somebody else that knew a bit more about and place the higher value and it started to grow and grow and eventually two hundred fifty thousand dollars was placed on this little piece of paper it wasn't really the piece of paper what was oniton it's the its value to that person it had it in their hands so what value we place on the word it might be something small in your life or might be something great it could be that you have a word the Bible app on your phone it might be just a smaller app that you read for what a how does it get its value to you amongst all the other things that you do on that device isn't you've drawn when you turn there the Firestone does it is it something that you want to go to was it was it the last thing weird we want to go to if we use it to read a Bible orbit or a book so the boy placed a small value on that stamp because he wanted something small but the true value was much greater so we sometimes place a value on on the earthly things much higher because we commit a lot more of our time and effort and energy into those things so we focused more on on on the earthly things so just want to take some examples of different items through the scripture that seemingly had no value into one day something quickened and that thing became of such value to that person and straightaway I want to just go through - Rahab Rahab you'll know what kind of a life she lived she was at harlot that was it was there and and she had brought in two strangers to the spires from Israel they came over and went to spy at Elena and she hid them from the main of the city and you you know the whole story but I just want to pick it up now from Joshua chapter 2 Joshua chapter 2 from verses 12 I do have most of scripture readings and stuff up on the slides so it says now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that he should that he will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and that he will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our lives for yours if you utter not this our business and it shall be when the Lord has given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she said then she let him down by a court through the window for a house was upon out on the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall verse 16 and says and she said unto them getta get you onto the mountains lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourself there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may he go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this time which thou has made a sweet behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou Judas led us down bar and they'll scarlet and I shall bring thy father in thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee so now the Scarlet thread that she's now just placing out there is beginning a promise attached to it something has been attached now to the sea it says and it shall be that whosoever shall go out the doors of the of the house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be within the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him so just wanna maybe Bremer Toit's a story a little bit around she might have you might ask where did this this cord at she come from where did this rope end up in her place it might have been left behind from a previous owner but just while we go through this keep in mind that this rope is a type of a token the word that we have today so up to this stage it was just an ordinary cord that was displayed laying there in the corner of her little house and maybe gathering dust she she had no real need for this there was no real importance to her she might have wanted to throw it away one day decide I need to clean up and get rid of this this is taking up too much space and I have no real need for that we just throw it out but the very thing that she did not have need of all that she thought she very did not have need of actually became the salvation for her family was the very thing that saved her and her family now suddenly this rope that that she had had a personal promise attached to it something that she could now hold on to something that she knew that was something special for her that rope means something new it had a different meaning it changed its value to her all of a sudden so it was no it's not just a book of promises now they lay on a shelf it becomes alive to you become something that is real to you then you open it it's now something because there is a promise attached to it for you person because it becomes a personal relationship now with that author of the book now it becomes a value so she had how household it was now under this token that was applied for this rope she would have now treated the scene totally different she knew these relax are coming to destroy them she knew that the head no hope we have no hope we had not hope outside of Christ she didn't she needed a way of escape she did something that she could step out of and get away from from this on sort that was coming against it and that's what in Joshua 2 & 9 it says and she said unto the men I know that the Lord has given you the land she knew that they were in trouble she knew that this great god of the Israelites they could never defeat him and she needed a way of escape she could identify that she needed something that her people did not have she knew they had something real and what she had and what the city had was not real they could not save her in their time of trouble that she could now step forward she needed to take a grasp of something something real something that they could promise to her that's what it was so then the Lord had given you the land and the terror is fallen upon us those people were fearful in a day and age it is so fearful out there that our world is falling apart we have something that has been given us that we can hold on to and that's exactly what this woman wanted she needed something that she could stand firm on and say I am confident now that I'll be saying this is what she needed for we have said and all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you the people around us are fainting it because of us because of what is coming upon the earth for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water they heard about these mighty things at the heaven and he said that how you destroy those other kings so she knew that they were just totally wiped out and she needed something when we need to get that revelation to that we are lost with outside of what outside of the Savior that we have neither because we were born in sin shaped in iniquity until we can actually grasp that we we are in that state until we can actually get that revelation that we need somebody to help us we cannot make it on our own anymore we cannot survive without something more than what we have right and if we need the cross that we need that what Christ had done if we stay in this simple condition we won't have a way of escape and we know that and you can see it but it needs to become a personal relationship so that we can place a higher value on what the cross means because sometimes it is just taken for granted and it's just a nice story but if it actually takes on a meaning to show you that you were totally lost and without that you're unable to get through to the other side without that they all meet the judgment and the wrath that is coming upon the earth so the Scarlet thread was her this escape from death now what was her value of this rope she have would have guarded it now with her why that hope had a different meaning to her from that day forth she would have found a special place to put this she would have guarded it with her life maybe beforehand she would have borrowed it out to somebody lent it out and didn't care if it came back or not but now somebody comes to me borrow their rope no it's mine not maybe I go out of my sight this is mine hi this is my word you can't have it anymore this is for me fine get your oil that you need I've got this holy goes how it is mine and she wins she would have gone to hell maybe wrap this rope around her and went into the town and she might have looked like an odd character to the people there why are you carrying this rope around with you the whole time you look strange it's the same walk around it's good along here you look strange what's a different way why you look why you burden yourself with us no but it was her way of escape she knew her identity she she could hold onto something and she wasn't gonna let it go because that's what they had promised for her she wanna look strange to this world we're oddballs to this world aro laughed at her and mocked her and no matter what they had said to her she wasn't gonna get rid of this token she knew she knew that she needed it and these people in the city didn't really understand what this was all about that she had away the sky one will see goes back to that little wash woman that the Prophet talks about yeah when that um the righteous son was looking for a wife and he went out there and those cousins that were treating you they weren't really badly Anette and he made a promise to her and what did she do she no matter what if accusations came against her she put their wedding gown with her she put it on she she walked around with this thing with a broad in her heart she knew it was her way of escape that he was coming to fetch her and no matter what the mockers and scoffers and or that came against her she hates her confidence in the promise it was given to her she put on that wedding garment and she went out to meet him so then the day came when the Israelites armies approached the city and she had a piece in her heart because she had kept two kept true to that word in the message the token says notice there was given to her a red token that scarlet string that she had let down let the people the spires down out of the window was to be a token God would not destroy the destroying angel God's destroying angel would not come near her as long as she had their token but and what if she would say oh I'll let it down I done I've done a good deed now so now to keep anyone from criticizing me see and seeing that scarlet rope hanging out there I'll pull the rope back up so now he's saying oh maybe she'll feel embarrassed that she's not gonna leave that rope there and she's gonna pull it up and hide it somewhere but no one sees it but he says he says I'll pull that rope back up says then the judgement angel wouldn't have never passed over her house if they token was not on display at judgment angel would have come in she had to have their token displayed it had to remain thee I believe that the scarlet thread had to be displayed or the angel destroying angel would have never honored anything else but their token when it was displayed amen messengers gave her a token and she must keep it display do we sometimes hide out okay do we sometimes hide that we are a Christian when we get into difficult situations maybe at school at work where we are let me hide their token waiter we'll just keep quiet or we'll just pertain to be like them or try and just fit in with the world not to stand out and maybe received some criticism and all those different things I'll be placing a higher value what the Lord has done for us no matter what comes our way are we going to stand and say this is what I believe I do not take that I do not do this because it's not pleasing unto my lord it's not the book of rules that the Lord has given us and that's what we need to understand he doesn't come and lay down rules and say this and this it's out of a reliable relationship that your coming to Christ and then we say because we love you Lord we don't want to do that yes people make mistakes we will fire a will or we'll stumble but Lord forgive me I don't want to do those things that's a different kind of a relationship it's not otherwise as a god that's every time you fall you expecting a smack and I'm gonna beating in a and a ridicule or a breaking down or a hard cutting sermon or whatever it might be and that's what we expect our God is like living under our law but he is here and it's he doesn't want the kind of a relationship with you he wants to be able to have the love relationship with you that you're his wife and how would you how would you treat your wife wants to treat you really had their kind of relationship so what if she didn't take care of this rope you know well it doesn't really matter if it's not the same her bow found another rope at the time and throw it out she might have got the the soldiers to believe it's the same road because they wouldn't have known it but the mighty God knew exactly which one what was the token so no matter how much pretense you might put on the outside what we might dress like away your act like it and that that God knows what the intent of the heart is we can look like brothers and sisters to each other but what about our heart how is there this be expressed what is inside there that we are hiding from everyone we can bring it out to the Lord and say Lord I identified I see myself in the word and I'll see our lack here and there don't beat yourself up because you don't match that you just go to the Lord and say Lord I see this but I can't change myself I can't fix the Lord and that's all he is wanting he wants you to surrender head in through his head and it's such a difficult thing to be able to die the dying process is hard if you just take any human that is sick and dying at all the hard time that they go through and to surrender your will and to surrender you have to the Lord that is a difficult process and the Lord is here to be with us through that different time but at heartens so another another item I want to cover off his Moses let's go to Exodus chapter 4 Exodus for from verses 1 to 5 that rod that Moses head was just an ordinary stick whoever he got it from we don't know exactly no it was just something that he had and Moses and this is from Jenna Exodus 4 verses 1 and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the LORD hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that what is in thine hand and he said a rod just an ordinary stick Lord his sister rod just a vessel just-just-just whereas I am just an ordinary thing and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it now all of a sudden his his stick 34 was just a common stick is got something some other meaning to it all of a sudden it becomes a snake a serpent and he said Coster on the ground and Moses feet look at Moses it reversed voices and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers and God of Abraham and God of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee up until this time Moses might not have given much thought about that rod it was a help to him maybe on his day to day life but he could not be but he could go without it there was days he maybe just left at the dying at home and picked up something else that he needed when he was out with the Sheep he might not have have cared too much I'd have just thrown a stick down in the corner lifted there when you got home he's tired we could just chuck it down are no care about it some mornings we couldn't found the stick and you would leave without it it would just go out on this day with without Ed intending to his daily business without founding his stick sometimes we treat the Word of God like that it's just another stick that's let's say or another book on the shelf so you could have gone many years like they just leave his home when sometimes you would take it sometimes he won't you're off the year off the euro you could have gone like that while he was out there on the backside of the desert a one special morning there was a there was something stirring in his heart there was something that Moses knew he had to go that day with that stick he didn't know why he didn't understand it but he knew he had to pick up that stick and take it with and found it and all now you didn't know where you put it the next day you threw it down somewhere so you got his servants in use what if we helped found the Sonny the stick I need this rod today for something reason something is compelling me I need to take this with me today and take it I need to go out and they would have hunted and looked in and found and he she ever came up with it and it's the same thing there might be a day in the morning in your life where you despite pass the word each day you skip over it okay it's not doesn't show much meaning to you today but there comes a day when the Lord inspires you to pick it up to tell it to a certain scripture and you read it and it is something that is quicken out to you becomes a person or a thing to you it becomes a revelation that the Lord wants to give you that day it sustains you and changes your life and it becomes then you've become a greater value to you you certain scriptures as you go through life that that the Lord gives you it to a difficult time and then all of a sudden it becomes an anchor something you go back to something that you can hold on to and that's what it's about so yes they would have been a lot of maybe heated conversations in their tent that day with them with Moses trying to found the stick but he's got it eventually and he went out and then while he was on the backside of the desert he's seen that strange sight that was just before the scripture was an exodus 3 he saw this the strange side of this burning bush and he turned aside that is an exodus three versus one Somoza skipped the flock as a city was in he came to that mountain of God even even to Horeb and the angel the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when you and when the Lord saw that he had turned aside to see God called unto Him out of the midst of the bush and said to Moses Moses and he said Here I am I was a stopped and turned aside to receive his commission he received his burning bush experience he received that attack that that experience with the Lord then as he was talking with God God said I'll give you a sign as you made earlier not gonna read that whole thing again but we've read that Scripture you'll give him a sign and the stick now became his sign became his token became what he held on to for the whole journey it was something that they used now most this caught the revelation of why you had to pick up that stick that day why he had her taken with him that that wasn't just an ordinary stick there the stick was predestinated before the foundation of the world to be there and to be used at their time and they might have been a Bible lying in your home when you bought it or a message book that you picked up somewhere it was a time where you've walked that path and something caught your attention you need to pick this up you need to take us with you today there is something in this set the Lord wants to reveal to me you might not have even thought that that it means anything but you took it that day but sometimes through their day there was something that quickens out of that word as you started to read it and became alive it became personal to you so now the sticker became a sign to Israel for many years to come and the message why it had to be shepherds it says now going he was going to change nature to make it work for them watch the pole watch the serpent watch the Red Sea and whatever that he did now look at that shepherds go making a way for them to go that stick that was in the Shepherd's I post every bit of Technology and all the things and the priest said the priest had said and that's shepherds rod led them right on down through every impossible thing well Pharaoh tried to think that the cataracts erupted up in the mountains and throw it at water then made it to turn into blood then God rained fire out of heaven he rained hail out of heaven and everything was done through this token to sing it but if Moses had received how Moses would have gone home their day was their different value on that stick he would have gone home and now found a special place to put this this this this rod that he had received with it with a promise attached to it became a special item for him it was the same stickers a day before to everyone else she's still the same stick it's still the same Bible as it was yesterday a hundred years a thousand years it's still the same book but now all of a sudden I was just had a different approach to it a different respect a different way he saw that that stick going forward because it became a personal experiences to me had an experience with the author of that of this book we have that experience then it becomes of a great value you can't go Dave a day without spending time in it [Music] so what value amount of value you place on an item is based on how I said item means to you at times we lose the value of this message at times we lose what a bet you really mean to us the first time became our path what God has done here each and every day Oh in our day what is he actually done it loses some values becomes common or something else gets more attention just the cares of life come in that robs us trials and things steal a joy away still the zeal away still the desires away the problems at work and their burdens and stress and all these things they'd weigh down heavy on us take our attention away instead of drawing us closer to the Lord he wants to kiss so you place a value on their Amen so just want to now just turn the service a little bit up we've looked at the value of an item and what it means in it but now I wanna go and look at the identification your identity because I'm gonna wrap up and tell you what God thinks of you what he says your identity so let's just look at this section now just knowing your true identity is really what I want to get across this morning to each and every one of you there's no what God thinks about you we need to founder our identification in the word we must find ourselves in there in the word and what God has said about us to determine our true value to determine what God thinks of us it's why the scripture says in Philippians 2 in verses 5 to 6 is a third man being you which we read in the opening scripture which was also in Christ Jesus who been in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God and we take on that mind of Christ then we start to see ourselves away God knows we start to see ourselves through his eyes and not the way that we can see herself in the mirror and we can identify ourselves as the Bride of Christ because now we're taking on the mind of Christ and now the way Christ sees us you see says he's bright it's virtuous Cygnus now we can start to say look I want dead wine I'm gonna see myself through that picture to those eyes that's what I want to see and the misidentification it says now just now Jesus gave us an example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into God's mirror we should see ourselves identified with him identified with him in assist that's the perfect example a perfect example is when we can see ourselves identified with him through his identification not on ourselves and our weaknesses and all those things when we look not the way we see ourselves when we look in the mirror but do we see and identify ourselves with Christ that's our true identification it is in God we identifies out of it another part of that message an identification says you you cannot no way ever produce a character like that only accepting their character in you a church cannot do that a creed cannot do that a denomination cannot do that an education cannot do that it must be a bird it's got to be a dying out and let God in by the grace of creb mold this type of character in here let you become him and your life and his is the same then you are the sons and daughters of God our wife and him when we have through that new birth we now fulfill a scripture we are we for furthered that his life is within us it's a dying out to ourselves and we cannot ever make it happen we can never produce that character as a prophet or the Lord is not one thing has to produce it and if we are still trying to produce it let me tell you to lay that there the Lord is not happy with us trying he wants none of our input he wants to receive all the glories I want to look at an example of someone that did not place much better on his life but God had told him he was comes and tells him who he was and that is didya getting in the bible did not see himself as much he was looking through his natural eyes and seeing all the obstacles seeing the enemy is seeing all these things they would come in and steal the wheat every here feeling that here is worthless he was nothing seeing how great the enemy was but what did the Lord declare is our density to be let's have a look at theirs in judges judges six verses 11 and 12 this is now the law the angel of the Lord prophesies capital ll or D which was God Himself came to came to Gideon this day wasn't just some angel it was the angel of the Lord this is then the angel of the Lord this is then there came an angel of the Lord and said under the oak which was in offer and pertained to Joyce the abra zire and his son giddy a threshing wheat in the what by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites now he was he was scared he was fearful he was now hiding his grains so that he could have some food for the next year because they always came in every time the media had to steal and to steal this seems away but look what the Lord says he said in and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto Him the Lord is with thee now mighty man of Valor the angel Oh Lord came to Gideon to declare his true identity to declare to him and say you are not this little one that needs to be running away from people but you are a mighty man of Valor you can stand toe-to-toe with Satan yea you can destroy him because of who I because of your true identity because I am backing you because their power of God is within you coming from me and I can slice a he has no grounds he's got no way to come against God's identification of who you are that counts not what the devil whispers in your ear he goes boo and you step back no we can boo back to him it's my we are my team innovate so the danger of the Lord coding that my team may know better this was not how Gideon saw himself but God saw him this way so many times look at ourselves and we break ourselves down because we see our mistakes our weaknesses our struggles our trials the different things they come our way and we think we are nothing but God's opinion or gods and she god doesn't have a pinion of you he has a fact it's just what it is there is no opinion the devil comes with his opinions and tries to make an opinion and say oh you if you if you are this if you are that he's trying to cost his kind of a DAT opinion God has said you are that settles it his word is final and the message has not I sent thee the proper season when he spake to Gideon Gideon was a little surprised he said now mighty man of Valor he didn't know he was maybe you don't know you are you might be many of those mighty men of vellus tonight sitting here there might be the young ones sitting here to that um this mighty men of era and you don't realize that Edward maybe hasn't come past your way to quicken or to show you to you and I'm just here this morning just to say you are you are that mighty you know that this is who what the scripture says about who you are there was only two to thee him and his daddy there it only has to be to hear you and Christ that's all it takes to be a mighty man of Valor that's right all it takes is Christ to you it all it takes us just him when you operates through you you don't have to do anything he just operates it through your life and you become a mighty man of Valor because of Christ you might be sitting here not thinking much of yourself but the Lord has declared that your is sinless virtuous bride there is nothing held to your account okay we come from God we were taken out of him we are bone of his bone we need was taken from Adam she did not know who she was I read him you Adam you believe came from Eve did not come up to Adam and say Adam I am bone of your and fish your fish I did not know that Adam knew that Adam was the one that says your bone of my bone a fish my fish that's in Genesis 2:21 and 23 and the Lord caused a deep sleep and it says took that rib and verse 22 which the Lord God has taken from a man and made a woman and brought her unto the man so now he takes it and he brings that woman on to the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man it was not even my TAV walked through the garden maybe an endless animal would have said I she look something similar to Adam or something similar to a serpent maybe she's this maybe she's that they would have questioned that and doubt it or maybe try to tell Eve this is who you are but when she came to the one that she came out of he could correctly identify and quiet and all those voices that would have come away through the day through the way through the years to say you not the bride you're not this you're not that here comes your Adam this morning to tell you you are the bride this is my opinion of you here come from me so how can identify who you are in giving you your true identity and not what the devil wants you to be and what this one says you are or what your mom or your dad says you are or how you feel about yourself but it's now Christ he's the one that steps forth and says this is who you are he identifies setting you cease your burn on my bone and flesh of my flesh you have come out of me that day on Calvary you came out of me so now you're coming back to me and this is who you are that's just exactly what Christ is doing is what Adam did there was our example he identified Eve so God is the one that declares to us who we are be a bone of his bone of viciousness not what we think of ourselves or what the devil tries we are a part of him the same way even Eve was taken out of edit I mean it is the rising of the Sun the Prophet says and as he as being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any other has spoken of the Bible it can only manifest if it does something it says it can only manifest . if it does something different from the groom it's not it isn't the bride so then it's a different anointing maybe that's on them I might still be speak make mistakes and do something somebody comes that they've allowed the spirit of something else to to come through a brother or a sister and we can identify that that's not that the Spirit of Christ we don't blame the man or the woman we look at then identify that spirit that is trying to operate through them they did his the bride tip it it isn't the brightest is because she is flesh of his fish bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him she is him as a man and a woman are one and the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the way the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics until the church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if it hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride Amy so will we we will be the same and of the station is because it's not him living through us so what did what what can you expect to be different it's just our complexes our insecurities that stop the moving of the Lord in our lives because we want to speak up too much maybe pride too much things that o will feel ashamed if we do this Oh will will have us in your pride is it no I don't want to do it I don't I look it like this that I want to look up look to be silly or anything like that but just Christ when he comes and takes and surrenders you surrender there to him he then operates on those 16 cylinders of the page there's a mighty machine moving through and there is nothing that can stand against God as those two and the scriptures that knew who they were and the classic example is David David is one that we we love so much because he was a man after God's own heart and when he came to fight Goliath What did he say in 1st Samuel 17 says then David didn't say David to the Philistines thou comest to me with the sword and with the spear and with the shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts and the god of the armies of Israel whom now defiers he was confident he knew who he was he knew who the children of Israel were he didn't doubt those things that he wasn't scared to confess it it's one thing to believe it it's one thing to say it in yourself but you confess it out that's the difference that's when Alexis shows that you have a revelation of what you're saying because you can't confess in the face of the enemy if you actually don't have it drawn down yes that's where needs to become a revelation yeah and God had showing David through the different experiences that he was with him God had proved to David and God proves to you week after week a little bit here a little bit there that he is with you he owns his prayer he undertakes in those times of trouble the times of need when everyone turns against you he is with you he was there to guide you to lead you he says in that day the scripture says in verse 46 this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and take that head from thee what confidence Hey what confidence he headed this devil this Giants and funnyman had no way of taking him out that day he was a mighty man of data he was someone that God had anointed for the job and he knew his God and I will give the get the caucuses of the host of the Philistines so it wasn't just Goliath it was the whole host of the Philistines those caucuses are all gonna be so he claimed the whole army was going to be taking it there not just this big boy I was mighty and take the hid from thee in the caucuses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel David knew who he was he did not question if the Israelites were the chosen people of God Inuit he was so many of their dead seeing what his identity was and knew he could confess it it was not a fright prophet tells another story of their slave it was out was taken from Africa - out of his home raiment and then they were came upon with I wanted to come and buy some of the slaves and they went to never look over the slaves to see which ones they wanted to buy and there was this one young man that was always upright and you didn't have to beat him you didn't have to do anything to him he was just working and committed to everything that he did and in the slave trader came and said he wants to buy that one and he said he's not for sale why why is he not for sale why is he he looks different to the others do you feed him different do you do you do something different for him is he treated if it no he's treated the same every way and what did they you know awesome said why why is he like that and then the slave trader guy said oh I also wondered one day why why he was like it so I found out that he was the son of a king you back in his home country he was a king's son and that made him in a certain way presents himself in a certain way because he knew where his destiny he where he came from and that's what we need to see is where we come from this morning we come from gardening we can act and respond the same way this morning is the free already there because that is our identity this morning even though he was alienated in this world from his from his son hometown he still acted as though he was a king Brennan says it bother you all and now you're alienated in this world with sin and chaos is it is yet stick your chest stick out your chest and throw up your hands your sons and daughters of a king that's how true identity this morning we are sons and daughters of a king we don't need a walk around defeated we don't need to walk around with our heads down low and have the pressure of everything around us we are the sons and daughters of a king I have everything we have ever need of you might not have riches we might not have all the wealth of the world and a Lexi Daisy life but it's not what we here for we're here on this earth to build a character that's the only thing we're taking worth and in a comfortable environment there is no way character is both if everything is just given to you there is no character you've got to work for it we've got a sucker for it there is things that we've got to develop and God allow certain situations to come our way so let's develop a character is because we need character in order to rank it's a value of our identity we go through times as I've said sometimes the news identification eyes get dimmed over and foamed over we get what we call a temporary amnesia we forget what actually we are due to those pressures and do two different things I feel that same way many times I'm the one that escapes this if not I maybe get it the worst get it hard it just comes to me so much that the pressure comes on whatever and you you get them Dover because of whatever the circumstances may be but from we can just step back and start a look at it from God's perspective look at the bigger picture and see their God it's got everything under control somehow as we go through these difficult times and the hard things somehow the grace of God brings us out on the other side we get a glimpse of the light and we get it breaks through we realize God is still with us the God is still in control God is everything will work out right with God Philippians 1:6 says being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ no matter what the outside looks like what your brother or sister is going through if God has started the work in that person he will finish it no matter what it is no matter how difficult it is oh wow Baxter than a brother or sister might be oh how hardships they going through it does not matter God has started that work he will patient if not for us is not for us to come and try and correct or fix that brother it's not our duty to try and make them better Christians it's our duty to get on our knees and call out to God and say Lord I see my brother and sister in this condition would you be merciful to him not stand on a side and criticize and touch this one in charge a one-celled effing serpent see because they're doing this this one is not longer than the message because they do they expose it you got nothing to do with it that's not the attribute of Christ the end of you know Christ will come an intersession for that way in the coming of the seed and come together and say we need a pray for this fight this pray they said get together and really put out praise for these ones Thanks Christ and being confident that he will bring it out don't focus on the negatives then focus on those things especially parents of children you see the thing and you expect them to act like an adult you expect them to be as as mature a Christian is what you are and they do this study thing on that sort of thing and we really call them and we break them down that's not a thing to be doing as parents we need to be encouraging them and and just help them not say turn a blind eye to any of the sinful things but through love show them the right way and allow them they need you ever an environment where they can make their decisions and maybe make a mistake so they can learn from it it's not wrong if they make a mistake because each one of us make mistakes and we don't want God there to come and whip us every time if we can learn from and he can encourage us and help us so we need to accept what God thinks of us but he has said we are we must identify with that and not what Satan wants us to believe we are a part of that original you're part of that original diamond if you take a diamond and you chip it off and you chip their diamond up into smaller diamonds all the attributes that was in their diamond is in those little ones nothing is anything less that's all there and we come from it great diamond we all chipped off of that great one you're a part of that so we reflect back those attributes because that is what is within us in the message in the future change it says a true Church of Jesus Christ the bride is like into pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness we have no righteousness alone the Lord is not one thing has to have righteousness self-righteousness he says his righteousness he gives they done to us her attributes are his his own glorious attributes her identity is found in heaven what he is she is to reflect so we do not produce anything of ourselves we are just a reflection of their great Sun as a moon reflects the sunlight so do we reflect the Sun we don't have anything of ourselves we don't bring anything of ourselves we have no light of our own we only reflect what Christ is he says her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to end she is the work of the law of her of her Lord and all his works are perfect the Lord does not do a half job everything he does is perfect so if he has started a work in your life you're perfect that's the way he sees you he's perfect and that's image that he has of you is your perfect perfect image it is in all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one Featherman how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith who God has spoken how can we accept this great miraculous seeing the God of creation and put the whole earth into in orbits and everything like that this great God how can we be like him it's not for us to figure it out of a feather minute it says the prophecies we are unable to fathom in our there's no way we could have a reason little guess at all or try and make it up says we can only accept it there is no way to understand it Amazing Grace that all it is the word needs to become the most important thing in our lives this cannot happen unless you identify yourself with the word the Prophet says here we can accept it by faith until we can identify that there is us that the word is talking about then it becomes a reality then it becomes a revelation and God reveals that and sinks a deep down into your heart that you're a part of him that you're a part of that word then you can March forth as true Victor's it's often listen to what people say you know listen to what Satan says your place there in a higher value higher regard instead of what God says about you we listen when a brother might come in but somebody might say something to you that maybe it's hurtful and you place there because of whatever the reason is above God point of view of you of God's fact of what you are and what God a said of who you are in the end it is God's thoughts towards us that counts of our own ways and then God is the one it's the judge God is the one that has said something about you no matter what somebody else comes up against you just say for the scripture says in Jeremiah 29:11 it says for I know the thoughts that I had toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected these thoughts towards you is not to have you an evil thought or to bring you to destruction but it's to bring you to an expected end in an end with him in glory that's what is affecting so you might go through hard times to break a certain stubborn nature that you might have the Lord needs to get that out so then you might think all the Lord doesn't care about me but no he does care so much you just don't understand from his perspective and how yet she loves you and what he is trying to achieve in your life man's ideas of you will fade people will come and go God will always remain the same and what he said about you will never change his love you will never change no matter how much bad you do or how much good you do you can never gain more favor and be less favored in his side you are the apple of his heart this morning you are the chosen bride of Christ nothing can take that away you're elected and predestinated fed no condemnation that's what Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit once we had that Spirit of Christ in us and we walk after that there is no more combination this is what the Lord says this is what he says about us we are that you're justified Romans 3:20 forces being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus justified freely just as if you've never done it it means that you've never sinned in the first place God wipes it so far from his memory that it doesn't exist anymore no matter how filthy your background is once you come to Christ and you repent of your wrongs he washes and you cleanse there is nothing that the devil can accuse your God does not remember that again so he cannot the devil will accuse you don't let him get by with that he will he will sit there every day and run and bring it back to your remembrance to try and bring you break down your confidence and who you are but God does not remember it that's why this is your just freely by His grace the grace of God to you you're justified in first Corinthians 6 verses tennessee's nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers or exhorting us shall inherit the kingdom of God none of those things well inheriting is a lot more other things before this in verse 9 that many of us is now Paul says you will see this this is in such inversive him and such with some of you many of us were those things above we were caught up in those things we were trapped in those things from our birth from what we were born into we come into this world speaking lies we are born in trapped in this sinful nature we automatically went that direction that he goes in he says but ye are washed but he are sanctified so he doesn't only wash you he also not sanctified you all but he are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God so then all those things that we had done in our past is gone the slate is clean we can stand here victorious [Music] [Applause] that's what God thinks of us so not too far from wrapping up I have a a little bit of a longest quote only to read but I feel this just sums up how God thinks about us as his bride it's from the message the invisible union of the Bride of Christ I do have it up on there so we'll go through the few slides just listen to what the Prophet is saying this is his message to the church just before he goes off the scene this is 6511 he's got a month left and this is what the Lord is wanting to tell you this is how much importance he has placed on you let's read this this morning he says he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness about the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bride room which foreordained you has washed you by the washing of the water since by the church this is not the Congressional says that don't sound right doesn't know you might find that in an almanac but not in God's Bible by washing of the water by the word in the word see it goes on you're a standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church this is message to the church listen if you are the Church of Christ with a capital C you are the bride this is the prophets message to you he's saying as you as we go off the air just in a minute you're standing if you're standing on God's Word and with God's Word every man every Amen every jot every tittle where you're standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from the shock and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the Sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah talk about Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know it's better than the Thanksgiving off that they were celebrating their time of the year in the state's sees you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the Son of the Living God this is God's view of who you are every man every every woman born of the Spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though that you never send at the first place you are perfect the blood of crisis Christ how can you if a man if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took my place he's saying that if somebody's took your place and stood there to die for you why would you need to die okay he came and took your place he stood there and said I will take all your sin upon our die for you that you can go that's what it is so you can never die because he had paid that ultimate price for you in Jesus the word took my place he became me that sinner that I might become him the word Amen let me hold true to it not the church the word Amen oh the spiritual union of Christ and his bride now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day why it's the culminating so it's culminating so fast out there in those deserts and the thing is taking place that I couldn't even keep up with it we are near the coming of Jesus to be united with his church where the word becomes a word you know it's word becoming that word again we are at spoken word call of the holy spirit searching the hearts the last one on us but it says you're standing completely you are standing completely you never sinned at the first place the who don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed and you're old book of divorcement is put away and it is dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God you are virtuous you're the virtuous Bride of Christ washed in the Bride of Christ precious purchase sinless son of God standing without with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which will predict podesta nature in the bosom of the Father before the beginning the same as he was he was the great attribute of God called love this sums up God's identification of you this is how God feels about you morning this is what he was so are we taking what saying I say Satan is saying which voice do you place more value on this way are we going to believe the report of the Lord are we going to repeat the report of Satan are we going to believe the report of the accuser or what the report of what the Lord has spoken through the Prophet to us and Hebrews Pollard greets us he says wherefore holy brethren how are we holy in ourselves we love sin but he sees you the way God sees you Paul identify this is holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling he identifies you as a holy and identify you as holy this morning forget about your mistakes forget about those things they took you up this morning even coming to children you've confessed it that is gone God sees you perfect sinless virtuous that's what is but no the devil wants to bring a fear upon you he wants to bring a doubt so that you don't see your true identity to make you that man of Valor in this hour he is trying to strip that thing away through you through fear that's exactly what he does because prophecies if you can ever get the scare out of the church and let them realize who they are and what they are positionally healing will be the simplest message to be preached or anything else but you're scared you're afraid you don't realize that your sons and daughters of God and now not we will be we are now science not something in the future you are now you build again you are now the sons in Georgia you know you came from him you're just now accepting you you attribute now the manifestation of it says God not way off in the future and we and we won't some time in the future set in heavenly places now we are seated in heavenly places right now now we are the sons and daughters of God it doesn't not yet appear that we shall be in the egg but we know we will see him for will have a body like his you'll see him as he is so that's my message this morning to you is just to identify who you really are to show you the value that God places on your identity on who you are because it's his identity you're a part of him and that means so much to him he can never let one of his get lost does that help of us stressing and worrying and concerning about this one gone this way or that one gone this way or our children are not saved yet or God we can rest in that they will come upon we can be like a Rahab and we'll take their token and you'll bring it in your house and your family will be safe bring them in show them the love of God and God will work in those hearts you will never lose one of his own we cannot save our children and that's the thing we cannot bring them up with that thing saying that yo there is nothing wrong with you you're fine you there do they need to raise up as a children and realize that they're born in sin the shapes in iniquity that they need a Savior but the out there evolution of knowing that they born in their condition and all contact them on otherwise it's self-righteousness I'm doing okay everything's fine but I'm really below it all they need to realize if they need a Savior and that's what Christ has come and then we can identify now with this Messiah we hire them right of Christ we are the chosen ones we are victorious we are they virtuous bride this morning so this trust has been an encouragement to use we can just um maybe bow our heads and then have a song that we want to see this is pray freshest heavenly father lord I thank you Father for your word I thank you Father for the confidence you have in your bride oh yeah because it's not her you have confidence you have
