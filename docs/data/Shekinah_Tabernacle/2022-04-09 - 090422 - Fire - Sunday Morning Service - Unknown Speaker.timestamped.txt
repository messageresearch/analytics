[57:54] amen it's good to be alive
[58:00] i think christians enjoy being alive
[58:03] who likes being alive
[58:06] when you can wake up and breathe man
[58:08] there's hope
[58:09] there's opportunity there's
[58:11] there's an opportunity
[58:13] for god to move in your life when you
[58:15] can wake up and breathe
[58:17] there's something there's there's an
[58:19] opportunity to lay hold of faith
[58:21] and see god
[58:24] answer that faith
[58:25] in his word there's opportunity if you
[58:27] see this when we die there's no more
[58:29] opportunity to do that
[58:30] so let's not be fearful let's be bold
[58:33] let's make the most of the opportunity
[58:34] that we have that we're alive
[58:37] and that we can have this faith you know
[58:39] as solomon says there's none of this is
[58:40] in the grave
[58:42] now i know we can't carry on living but
[58:43] you know naturally speaking
[58:45] we're not doing anything in the grave
[58:47] but while we're here
[58:49] let's
[58:50] let's make the most of what we have
[58:51] let's and
[58:53] you know i've always said i'm gonna i
[58:54] want to go out on a blaze of glory
[58:56] you know and that's that's
[58:57] but that's what we have as believers you
[58:59] know we're a people full of faith
[59:01] and and
[59:03] i've got a um i've got a thought this
[59:05] morning that i want to um
[59:07] share it's been a little bit tricky the
[59:09] last few times to get something together
[59:11] because we're
[59:12] living in a new place and i think it's
[59:14] psychological you know you kind of your
[59:16] mind's not really settled into your new
[59:18] place and where are all your spots where
[59:19] do you go
[59:22] and it's a bit smaller too so there's a
[59:23] lot more i've got a lot more people
[59:24] around me all the time
[59:26] because
[59:27] the other house was very big so you
[59:28] could sort of
[59:29] it's like we had a few houses here you
[59:31] could be in a separate place but this
[59:32] place is there's people everywhere
[59:34] everywhere you go there's people there
[59:35] people
[59:39] and i haven't quite got outside spots to
[59:41] go yet you know
[59:43] so i have a few but yeah so it's been
[59:46] psychologically it's been a little bit
[59:48] um
[59:49] i haven't really found my little
[59:53] you know
[59:54] i don't think i'm getting old but you
[59:55] know you get used to something and then
[59:57] you have something new and you're like
[59:58] whoa whoa whoa hang on hang on this is
[1:00:00] not what we're used to
[1:00:01] um
[1:00:03] you'd have you'd all have that right so
[1:00:05] you know you have your
[1:00:06] and you're getting your habits and you
[1:00:07] have your little places where you go
[1:00:09] maybe you sit down and you read in that
[1:00:10] spot and you do it in that spot here and
[1:00:12] you get familiar with it so when you go
[1:00:13] back there it's kind of like
[1:00:15] psychologically you can
[1:00:17] just be a bit more peace when you're
[1:00:19] there because it's familiar surroundings
[1:00:20] you know we we like familiarity as
[1:00:22] humans we're like that's that's what
[1:00:24] we're like we get comfortable you know
[1:00:25] we like this is familiar we like that
[1:00:28] i thank god that we can become familiar
[1:00:30] in his presence you know so when we're
[1:00:32] outside of that we're like well this is
[1:00:33] not familiar i'm not i'm not comfortable
[1:00:35] here i like to be in a familiar place
[1:00:38] but
[1:00:39] i have managed to sort of battle through
[1:00:41] and figure out and get some little quiet
[1:00:43] places here and there
[1:00:45] but it hasn't been
[1:00:47] i don't think it's been anything
[1:00:48] spiritual i don't like to give satan too
[1:00:50] much credit that he oh you know i've
[1:00:51] been under such attack you know he's
[1:00:53] always up to that anyway you know i was
[1:00:55] always it was a struggle to come to
[1:00:56] church this morning well when isn't it
[1:00:58] you know
[1:00:59] it always is he's always going to try
[1:01:00] and do his thing but you know you just
[1:01:01] say look i don't care i'm getting up
[1:01:03] you know i've often thought getting up
[1:01:05] and going to church is one of the most
[1:01:06] easiest things a human being can do in
[1:01:07] this day and age really
[1:01:09] all we have to do is just wake our body
[1:01:11] up
[1:01:12] you know put some nice clothes on it hop
[1:01:14] in a car most of us got vehicles you
[1:01:16] know and just drive you know we turn up
[1:01:18] it's not there's not too much of a
[1:01:19] spiritual battle going on there like can
[1:01:21] we just tell our body body wake up hop
[1:01:24] in that car start it up and drive to
[1:01:25] that building and go and sit down in
[1:01:27] there
[1:01:27] you know we have the ability to do that
[1:01:31] you know it's not like we are going
[1:01:33] through a war zone and like wow man
[1:01:34] almost died on the way here you know
[1:01:37] you understand like like we need to we
[1:01:38] somehow sell with such a battle we give
[1:01:40] satan all this credit to that he's doing
[1:01:42] all these things but really you know
[1:01:43] it's quite a simple thing to get up and
[1:01:44] go to church
[1:01:47] that's just well maybe that's just my
[1:01:49] opinion but that's the way i've always
[1:01:50] thought of well do what you want satan
[1:01:52] it's not i can't actually unless you
[1:01:54] physically maim me and i can't actually
[1:01:56] physically hop in my car i can i've got
[1:01:58] the ability to get there and go and do
[1:01:59] it
[1:02:00] you know and
[1:02:02] i think that's what we do as christians
[1:02:03] that's why you're all here
[1:02:05] you know because you you've made that
[1:02:07] effort and god sees the effort you know
[1:02:09] you we
[1:02:10] god sees all the effort we make
[1:02:12] you know and and
[1:02:14] i'm going to get to my sermon shortly
[1:02:15] but i was thinking
[1:02:17] you know that that what when we do that
[1:02:19] it's called the fight of faith you know
[1:02:20] we are battling
[1:02:22] for the kingdom of god and it has an
[1:02:24] effect when you when you make an effort
[1:02:26] for the kingdom of god it has an effect
[1:02:27] on you and it has an effect on those
[1:02:29] around you
[1:02:30] it has a positive effect on the kingdom
[1:02:31] of god like if none of us made an effort
[1:02:33] and came this wouldn't be here but but
[1:02:35] we make an effort we come we fight the
[1:02:37] good fight of faith each and every day
[1:02:39] and it has
[1:02:40] it pushes the kingdom of god forward you
[1:02:43] know and every everything that we do for
[1:02:45] the kingdom of god is not in vain it
[1:02:47] doesn't it doesn't just
[1:02:49] have no effect it has an effect right
[1:02:51] because you could be doing something the
[1:02:52] opposite against the kingdom of god and
[1:02:54] it would have an effect the other way so
[1:02:56] be encouraged everything that you do for
[1:02:58] the kingdom of god
[1:02:59] has an effect
[1:03:01] you know and you're you're all you're
[1:03:02] fighters you every like now you're
[1:03:04] you're what you're doing now is standing
[1:03:06] up and fighting back you're saying no
[1:03:07] i'm fighting back that's what you're all
[1:03:09] doing here your mighty warriors saying
[1:03:11] i'm fighting back i'm making a stand i'm
[1:03:14] pushing forward
[1:03:15] and and
[1:03:16] if you push forward every promise in the
[1:03:17] book is yours there's no promise that
[1:03:19] you cannot have in the name of the lord
[1:03:22] if you want it you can have it just push
[1:03:23] forward and you'll get it some of them
[1:03:24] come straight away some of them take a
[1:03:26] long time but that's
[1:03:27] what it is when you're a soldier you can
[1:03:29] push forward and claim it all
[1:03:30] so what we're doing here is having an
[1:03:32] effect
[1:03:33] it's having an effect lives are being
[1:03:34] changed the kingdom of god is being
[1:03:36] pushed forward the kingdom of satan has
[1:03:38] been shaken and disrupted
[1:03:40] so
[1:03:41] be encouraged amen
[1:03:43] the sermon that i the thought that i had
[1:03:45] on my heart this morning was fire and
[1:03:47] i'm going to go quite fast through this
[1:03:48] if that's right i've got
[1:03:51] i've got a certain portion to get
[1:03:52] through so i want to go quite quick once
[1:03:54] i start
[1:03:55] start doing it and
[1:03:57] i've got lots of scripture verses here
[1:03:58] so i didn't really do any verses at the
[1:04:00] start so this is we're just going to
[1:04:01] make a start so
[1:04:02] i want to talk about fire who likes fire
[1:04:05] when your boys love fire who do you like
[1:04:07] fire boys is
[1:04:08] you know as soon as you make a buy or
[1:04:10] you have like a campfire what's the
[1:04:12] first thing everyone does is grab a
[1:04:14] stick and put it in the fire you know
[1:04:15] and then there and then you get about 10
[1:04:16] little kids around them before you know
[1:04:18] they've got these flaming sticks with
[1:04:19] burning amazon looking around and
[1:04:21] talking to their friends and these
[1:04:24] we have a rule whenever there's a fire
[1:04:25] no
[1:04:26] children allowed to put sticks in the
[1:04:27] fire you know not we're trying to spoil
[1:04:29] the fun but you know you're going to get
[1:04:31] people are going to get branded you know
[1:04:33] with a
[1:04:34] brand mark on them
[1:04:36] we don't want that but you know that's
[1:04:38] we love fire fire is an amazing thing i
[1:04:40] think i think god loves fire
[1:04:43] god made this thing called fire and god
[1:04:45] actually really likes fire it's
[1:04:47] it's it's something special to him this
[1:04:48] concept of fire and
[1:04:51] and i think as as christians we should
[1:04:52] love fire fire such a great thing we
[1:04:54] often think of the fires of hell and we
[1:04:55] relate fire to this darkness but you
[1:04:57] know
[1:04:58] that's not really
[1:04:59] actually fire belongs to us fire is a
[1:05:01] great thing you know and god god's a god
[1:05:03] of fire he loves fire
[1:05:05] and
[1:05:07] i'm just going to take you through some
[1:05:08] of these verses and then i'll
[1:05:10] carry on these are just different things
[1:05:12] i found that god associates himself with
[1:05:13] fire
[1:05:14] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[1:05:16] him unto moses and a flame of fire out
[1:05:19] of the midst of a bush decided to come
[1:05:21] down and appear as a fire you know he
[1:05:23] could have appeared as a person or
[1:05:24] different things but he appeared as a
[1:05:26] flaming fire in this bush
[1:05:29] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[1:05:30] with fire and the bush was not consumed
[1:05:32] that's the fire of god god likes to
[1:05:34] associate himself with fire amen god
[1:05:37] loves fire here's another one
[1:05:39] and the lord went before them
[1:05:40] by a day and a pillar of cloud
[1:05:44] to lead them
[1:05:45] in the way and by night and a pillar of
[1:05:47] fire to give them light to go by day
[1:05:50] and night
[1:05:51] so god led the children of israel with a
[1:05:53] by a pillar of fire at night
[1:05:56] he could have had some other maybe
[1:05:57] object to do it but he chose to be a
[1:05:59] pillar of fire this is where moses was
[1:06:01] up
[1:06:02] on the mountain and the sight of the
[1:06:04] glory of the lord was like a devouring
[1:06:06] fire on the top of the mount in the eyes
[1:06:08] of the children of israel so when god
[1:06:10] was when god was anywhere there was fire
[1:06:12] up on top of this mountain the children
[1:06:13] of israel looked and they saw that the
[1:06:15] top of the mountain looked like it was
[1:06:16] going to erupt with fire because god was
[1:06:18] up there
[1:06:19] i think of the story of brother branham
[1:06:21] when he went up to finger rock
[1:06:23] and god met him there and people said
[1:06:24] that they saw a fire coming down and up
[1:06:27] onto the mountain
[1:06:29] because god's a god of fire he loves
[1:06:31] fire for our god is a consuming fire
[1:06:34] that's what it says about god he's a
[1:06:36] consuming fire
[1:06:39] and
[1:06:40] here's another here's another
[1:06:42] aspect of fire when the when the holy
[1:06:45] ghost came
[1:06:46] there were there was tongues of fire as
[1:06:49] it would seem
[1:06:50] fell across each one so here's this
[1:06:52] great god of fire came down and
[1:06:53] separated himself and all these little
[1:06:55] little piece i wouldn't say pieces of
[1:06:57] god but a separation of god you know
[1:06:59] from a fire you can take out you can
[1:07:00] take out a bit of fire and put it
[1:07:01] somewhere else
[1:07:02] that went on top of each person
[1:07:06] and there appeared unto them cloven
[1:07:08] tongues like as fire and it sat upon
[1:07:09] each of them so here's this fire people
[1:07:12] people looked around they saw fire
[1:07:13] because god's a god of fire
[1:07:15] he god loves fire
[1:07:17] i'm just gonna
[1:07:18] take you through some real simple facts
[1:07:20] about fire that that are so simple we
[1:07:22] all know them but you need three things
[1:07:23] to make a fire well the first thing is
[1:07:25] fire is actually uh
[1:07:27] it's actually uh
[1:07:28] an event
[1:07:30] it's not really a thing it's a chemical
[1:07:31] reaction so
[1:07:33] it's not actually a
[1:07:36] it just comes and goes you know it's a
[1:07:38] fire is a chemical reaction and it needs
[1:07:40] three
[1:07:41] elements to react it needs
[1:07:43] uh fuel which is essentially hydro
[1:07:45] hydrocarbon hydrogen carbon but fuel
[1:07:47] like
[1:07:49] hydrogen and carbon which is essentially
[1:07:51] anything that burns there's a good
[1:07:52] chance it's got hydrogen or carbon
[1:07:53] inside it because it's burning
[1:07:55] and
[1:07:56] it needs oxygen
[1:07:58] and it needs heat and if you get those
[1:08:00] three things together
[1:08:02] then you will create a chemical reaction
[1:08:04] called fire because you could have you
[1:08:05] could have fuel and you could have
[1:08:06] oxygen like this disc and oxygen but if
[1:08:09] this won't catch on fire unless i unless
[1:08:11] this gets to a certain heat and then
[1:08:13] this chemical reaction will suddenly
[1:08:14] trigger at a certain point
[1:08:16] so all if i want to make this catch on
[1:08:19] fire i just have to figure out a way to
[1:08:20] make that there hot because we've got
[1:08:22] oxygen here
[1:08:23] and eventually it will actually burn it
[1:08:25] will catch on fire this chemical
[1:08:26] reaction will
[1:08:28] will kick in and
[1:08:30] we have been man has not so much now but
[1:08:34] up until maybe a hundred years ago fire
[1:08:37] was massive in people's lives it was
[1:08:38] basically your whole life revolved
[1:08:40] around fire you know for since time
[1:08:43] began
[1:08:44] our whole life revolved around fire fire
[1:08:46] was the you know you take out fire out
[1:08:48] of a out of a person's life
[1:08:51] up to about 100 years ago you were done
[1:08:53] life life no longer was going to exist
[1:08:55] very pleasantly for you as what it used
[1:08:57] to with fire it was an essential element
[1:09:00] of survival
[1:09:01] way way back this is uh i was going to
[1:09:03] take you through a few of these because
[1:09:04] most people they they cooked from fire
[1:09:07] and then they got heat from fire that
[1:09:09] was the general idea the indians would
[1:09:11] get creative and make like you know
[1:09:13] american indians they would have like
[1:09:14] smoke signals with fire they would
[1:09:17] if they you know cover over and let the
[1:09:19] smoke go up and then someone in the hill
[1:09:20] a long way away could read that signal
[1:09:22] the chinese used to have um
[1:09:24] fire lights on the on the great wall so
[1:09:26] they could alert someone they would
[1:09:27] light a fire and then someone on the
[1:09:29] furthest part of the wall would see that
[1:09:31] fire and they would relay that message
[1:09:32] so they could get a message back
[1:09:34] hundreds of kilometers within a few
[1:09:36] minutes you know back to to say
[1:09:37] someone's attacking this part of the
[1:09:39] wall and then they could send a message
[1:09:40] back through these
[1:09:41] these
[1:09:42] fire signals but this here is actually
[1:09:45] that looks like a modern day cooking
[1:09:46] appliance say
[1:09:47] that's a roman cooking appliance is that
[1:09:49] the romans cooked so because they had
[1:09:52] iron they they knew how to
[1:09:54] use um fire to make you know heat that's
[1:09:57] a heat iron
[1:09:59] so that that was these guys probably ate
[1:10:01] quite well this is a roman cooking
[1:10:04] these people i don't know this was
[1:10:06] somewhere these guys use pottery you
[1:10:07] know some people would would heat up get
[1:10:09] clay and they would they would do all
[1:10:11] their cooking and looks like a
[1:10:13] clay grill in a clay pot
[1:10:16] some people were a bit more primitive
[1:10:17] just had a fire with a stick over it
[1:10:19] with a pot hanging on it you know
[1:10:21] andy will like this next one this is an
[1:10:23] old pizza oven
[1:10:26] but this this is probably still there
[1:10:28] and it was probably built a thousand
[1:10:29] years ago
[1:10:30] you know some of these things
[1:10:32] but but this this all revolves around
[1:10:34] fire here's some what are these things
[1:10:36] what's this bro there's a big thing
[1:10:38] there
[1:10:40] yeah what's this there's some sort of
[1:10:41] other big oven thing she's cooking in
[1:10:43] there yeah what
[1:10:44] what is it
[1:10:46] it's not like an oven
[1:10:50] mmm looks good if it looks like it'll
[1:10:51] cook some nice food in there this is all
[1:10:54] fire everything this if you took a fire
[1:10:56] away none of this stuff would exist
[1:10:58] here's a this is an old english stove
[1:11:00] you know the cooking
[1:11:01] up till not very long ago was done in a
[1:11:03] it all revolved around a fire you want
[1:11:05] to make yourself some food you like the
[1:11:07] fire same with this one this is
[1:11:09] different
[1:11:10] big old open fires in there
[1:11:12] it has a nice old kitchen doesn't this
[1:11:14] look nice something natural and nice
[1:11:15] about fire you know when you look at
[1:11:16] fire you think this is nice you know
[1:11:18] it's a relaxing how many times have you
[1:11:20] looked at fire
[1:11:21] at a fire burning in the the little um
[1:11:25] sparks are just rising up and it's
[1:11:26] giving this nice glow you know the glow
[1:11:28] is like a yellowy glow and it goes back
[1:11:30] and forth it doesn't just we turn these
[1:11:31] lights on and they just go they're on
[1:11:33] you know there's no
[1:11:35] this thing's falling off my head there's
[1:11:36] no um
[1:11:39] there's no thing on it
[1:11:41] um
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:44] brother it could you just while i'm
[1:11:46] talking could you just i'll see how i go
[1:11:49] you know you see the yellow glow this
[1:11:50] has fallen off me
[1:11:52] it's got no piece on it um you see the
[1:11:54] yellow glow coming up and it's it's very
[1:11:57] nice
[1:11:58] here's here's this is my last one of the
[1:12:02] this is an open fire
[1:12:04] very inefficient but every home back in
[1:12:05] the back in the back until we got like
[1:12:11] back until
[1:12:14] where's that little piece for it
[1:12:20] not very good technology
[1:12:23] it's a new one it doesn't work
[1:12:28] it's all up
[1:12:30] we'll try it
[1:12:36] now who knows how to start a fire
[1:12:39] really easy
[1:12:41] you get like a
[1:12:43] um they call them cigarette lighters but
[1:12:45] that's only because people like
[1:12:46] cigarettes with them but it's
[1:12:47] essentially just a lighter
[1:12:49] that's or matches that's what you know
[1:12:51] and anything with anything else
[1:12:53] generally not how you use a
[1:12:56] what we call a cigarette lighter or
[1:12:57] matches you know and they they create
[1:12:59] like a cigarette lighter the way it
[1:13:01] works is
[1:13:02] is
[1:13:03] you've got the
[1:13:04] um hydro
[1:13:06] hydrocarbon which is basically the gas
[1:13:09] that's what that's your fuel
[1:13:11] you've got a
[1:13:13] you've got
[1:13:14] well that that kind of uses the you've
[1:13:16] got oxygen in the air and then the way
[1:13:18] that the works is when that when you
[1:13:20] turn it it sends off a tiny little spark
[1:13:22] when it rubs over the front you know go
[1:13:24] like that and it rubs the flint real
[1:13:25] quick and it sends a little spark
[1:13:27] shooting forward and it ignites the
[1:13:30] the fuel it's quite a basic little thing
[1:13:32] you know we think well look at this
[1:13:33] lighter but it's very simple technology
[1:13:36] but um
[1:13:37] there was a time where people didn't
[1:13:38] have a lighter or matches you know so
[1:13:40] and that was
[1:13:42] for the whole millennium when people use
[1:13:43] fires they didn't have the simple fire
[1:13:44] lighting equipment like we have
[1:13:47] you know you take for granted like say
[1:13:49] the maori people you know that that were
[1:13:50] here
[1:13:51] how did they light a fire you know
[1:13:54] it's quite a hard thing to do really you
[1:13:55] think man like if we got
[1:13:57] chances are if any of us got stuck in
[1:13:58] the bush without a lighter or without a
[1:14:02] some matches we will probably not be
[1:14:03] able to light the fire
[1:14:05] but you could easily easily get two
[1:14:07] pieces of wood in light of fire it's not
[1:14:09] actually very hard if you want to just
[1:14:10] go on youtube you'll see especially um
[1:14:12] pacific islanders there's one that these
[1:14:14] guys do it's very simple
[1:14:16] this one here was they just had a piece
[1:14:18] of wood
[1:14:19] about that long and another piece of
[1:14:21] wood and you just make a small groove
[1:14:22] and they just rub it back and forth in
[1:14:24] the groove
[1:14:25] if you do it slow at the start and then
[1:14:27] it builds up tiny little dust particles
[1:14:29] because you're pushing it to the front
[1:14:30] and it builds up a tiny little you know
[1:14:31] you might have a square centimeter of
[1:14:33] dust particles then you just go a little
[1:14:34] bit faster
[1:14:36] and it just smokes before you know it
[1:14:38] this little bit of smoking it takes
[1:14:40] about all of about one minute to do it
[1:14:42] for 45 seconds and you've got and it's
[1:14:44] smoking and then they just get a little
[1:14:46] piece of um
[1:14:47] anything anything dry like dry
[1:14:50] hay or you know dry grass or something
[1:14:52] very everything has to be very dry
[1:14:54] and they just pour that those tiny
[1:14:56] little particles they just it's
[1:14:58] basically dust they pour the dust in and
[1:15:00] just blow that and then it
[1:15:02] within about two minutes you've got a
[1:15:03] fire in your hand from two pieces of
[1:15:05] stick it's not it's very it's actually
[1:15:07] very simple
[1:15:08] you think it's very hard then you see
[1:15:10] these guys do it
[1:15:11] the romans that so that that was the
[1:15:14] a lot of the pacific island people this
[1:15:15] is how they started the fire
[1:15:17] and they had lots of fire so this works
[1:15:18] you know they always had fires the
[1:15:20] romans used to have a piece of
[1:15:22] flint or or a piece of fool's gold with
[1:15:25] a piece of steel and they would do this
[1:15:27] and they would get a they would have
[1:15:28] there was a fungus that grew on trees
[1:15:30] and they would take that fungus off and
[1:15:31] they would just scrape tiny little
[1:15:33] particles it's all about getting dust
[1:15:35] sized particles because they would
[1:15:36] scrape off little dust sized particles
[1:15:38] to about a square centimeter on a table
[1:15:41] and and if one spark hit that it would
[1:15:43] just form the tiniest little fire you
[1:15:45] could think of it was only like one dust
[1:15:47] particle was caught on fire it's all you
[1:15:48] needed one little
[1:15:50] dust particle and then they would that
[1:15:51] would catch on to maybe two or three
[1:15:52] we're talking a tiny flame and they
[1:15:54] would just let that go for a bit then
[1:15:56] they would the same they would always
[1:15:58] scrape that dust onto another piece of
[1:15:59] dry
[1:16:00] material and then that would catch on
[1:16:02] fire but
[1:16:04] the indians similar technique they would
[1:16:06] rub
[1:16:07] a piece of wood this way into another
[1:16:09] piece of wood but they would make these
[1:16:11] little grooves on the side so that as
[1:16:13] they
[1:16:14] they what the fire would start in there
[1:16:16] and then the reason why for the groove
[1:16:17] was because then they could pour that
[1:16:18] into the whatever else they wanted to
[1:16:20] light you know so they would go like
[1:16:21] this
[1:16:22] and this is this doesn't you're not
[1:16:24] sitting there for hours doing this if
[1:16:25] your water is dry these guys are
[1:16:28] not as fast as a lighter but within a
[1:16:29] minute these guys have got a fire going
[1:16:31] you know it's
[1:16:32] all the greeks you know how the greeks
[1:16:34] did it they had um
[1:16:37] they had they had glass
[1:16:40] they had um
[1:16:41] they because all you need is heat right
[1:16:42] so they just had they had a little
[1:16:44] substance there and they would just get
[1:16:45] magnifying glasses and use the sun a lot
[1:16:47] of them would just use the sun because
[1:16:48] it's probably the sun's always shining
[1:16:49] in grease and it would just
[1:16:51] it would
[1:16:52] create heat on a certain spot and
[1:16:54] eventually when you get something to a
[1:16:55] certain heat that chemical reaction
[1:16:57] kicks in which is fire and that would
[1:16:59] it would burn you can actually light a
[1:17:01] fire with ice you know you think oh i'm
[1:17:03] in the i'm out in the
[1:17:05] arctic how am i gonna light a fire but
[1:17:08] if you you can people do it they make a
[1:17:10] get a block of ice and you form it like
[1:17:11] a dome on one side shrine it up and the
[1:17:13] sun shines through that onto whatever it
[1:17:15] is they're trying to light and they
[1:17:16] let's say your light fires that would be
[1:17:18] how the eskimos look fires and they
[1:17:20] didn't have wood you know it's quite
[1:17:21] common so if you get stuck in the snow
[1:17:23] and there's icy you could light a fire
[1:17:24] with the ice
[1:17:26] um
[1:17:28] but
[1:17:29] you know god often return
[1:17:32] talks about
[1:17:33] us having a fire in us you know and
[1:17:35] that's the fire of god and
[1:17:38] you know we as well
[1:17:39] as believers
[1:17:41] if we're if we're a christian we've got
[1:17:42] this fire burning in us you know and at
[1:17:44] some point god's letting that fire in us
[1:17:46] you know he's gone to the trouble to
[1:17:48] light a little fire here we are we're
[1:17:50] like this fuel and oxygen but we need
[1:17:51] this little spark somewhere at some
[1:17:53] point we need this little spark to come
[1:17:55] come and light us you know and i've
[1:17:57] often thought you know god's a consuming
[1:17:59] fire so you know if god comes near you
[1:18:00] maybe if our wood's all about wet if
[1:18:02] that fire starts to come near you it
[1:18:03] starts to dry everything out you know
[1:18:05] you see someone when god starts to work
[1:18:07] in their life you just see you see god
[1:18:08] start to draw close to them and it seems
[1:18:11] like they're starting to just change you
[1:18:12] know the things they used to do they're
[1:18:13] not quite doing any more they've got
[1:18:14] more of an interest to come to church
[1:18:16] they're more receptive to the things of
[1:18:18] god it's just all that fuel's drying out
[1:18:20] ready to catch on fire you know because
[1:18:21] it's hard to like wet wood you know so
[1:18:23] that god's drawing close and they're
[1:18:25] just starting to all the water's
[1:18:26] evaporating it's all getting nice and
[1:18:28] dry then at some point
[1:18:30] that that little maybe god just draws
[1:18:32] just just that little bit closer you
[1:18:34] know so there's the flame of god just
[1:18:36] looks over to that to that dry wood that
[1:18:38] that's you that's your spiritual life
[1:18:40] and it just sets you on fire
[1:18:42] it's not always it's not it's not a
[1:18:44] usually fires you know when you light a
[1:18:46] fire people often make a big one like
[1:18:48] this you know and then you light it
[1:18:50] that's not really how you do it you
[1:18:51] actually just make a fire that big you
[1:18:53] just have a small one because after the
[1:18:55] time when you do a fire that big
[1:18:56] nothing burns then you end up you're
[1:18:58] just focusing on a small spot anyway but
[1:19:00] that's actually how you do it you just
[1:19:01] have a little small spot you just put
[1:19:03] little bits of wood bit more bit more
[1:19:05] you just you only need one spark and
[1:19:08] that's how god does it you know
[1:19:09] sometimes you might not see what's going
[1:19:10] on but there's a little someone's warmed
[1:19:12] up and then that little fire started in
[1:19:13] their heart you know i've seen people
[1:19:15] like that you don't realize god's doing
[1:19:16] something but there's a fire now it's
[1:19:17] already listened you didn't know it and
[1:19:19] they tell you months later man that back
[1:19:21] there when i was at that meeting this
[1:19:22] happened to me
[1:19:23] you know there was a little fire burning
[1:19:24] and then it just and god just continues
[1:19:27] to put one on that fire and it gets
[1:19:28] bigger and bigger and bigger that's the
[1:19:29] nature of fire if you just keep putting
[1:19:31] things on it it grows you know
[1:19:32] and
[1:19:34] and i think that's what happened here
[1:19:36] you know these these men were already
[1:19:38] these guys actually these guys have been
[1:19:40] in the presence of the lord for so long
[1:19:41] this was all this dry wood ready for a
[1:19:43] bonfire you know this this and they were
[1:19:44] all together so when when that spark of
[1:19:47] god came down to this gathering it was
[1:19:49] like tinder it was a tinder box in there
[1:19:51] you know the whole thing just caught on
[1:19:52] fire and every heart was just on fire
[1:19:54] there was no you know this this is
[1:19:56] probably a
[1:19:57] i think this was a bonfire spiritual
[1:19:59] bonfire not not all fires start like
[1:20:01] this but sometimes you know you get the
[1:20:02] right fuel it just goes boom
[1:20:04] away you go
[1:20:05] another way that they used to light
[1:20:07] fires in the olden times was they would
[1:20:08] um not let the fire go out it was a that
[1:20:11] was a good you know because you didn't
[1:20:12] want to have to do this all the time or
[1:20:13] rub your wood or do you flint so you
[1:20:15] just generally didn't keep your you
[1:20:16] didn't let your fire go out because then
[1:20:18] you wouldn't have to go through the
[1:20:18] hassle of starting a new fire but if it
[1:20:20] did you could go to your neighbor's
[1:20:22] house hey buddy my f my fire's gone out
[1:20:24] can i have some of your fire
[1:20:26] you know and you could get some of that
[1:20:27] fire and i think there's a good lesson
[1:20:29] in that you know that's that's this is
[1:20:31] about fellowship you know
[1:20:33] if you know sometimes you might be a bit
[1:20:34] down and you're you're all a bit you
[1:20:36] know the fire's gone down a bit you go
[1:20:37] and fellowship with a believer that's on
[1:20:38] fire and it their fire
[1:20:40] burns you off but lights you up you come
[1:20:42] back and you how many have had that you
[1:20:43] know you feel refreshed it's like wow
[1:20:45] i'm on fire again you know that was that
[1:20:47] was a good experience being in the
[1:20:48] presence of those people they've given
[1:20:49] you a bit of their fire
[1:20:51] and that's why they say you got it it's
[1:20:52] a good thing to come to church you know
[1:20:54] because they say the easiest way to for
[1:20:55] amber to get to go out is to take it out
[1:20:57] of the fire to sit it over there by
[1:20:58] itself and before you know it it'll go
[1:21:00] out because you know when you put embers
[1:21:01] in a fire they all actually burn each
[1:21:03] other so that it all keeps each other
[1:21:04] burning so
[1:21:05] if you want to stay on fire for god just
[1:21:07] stay amongst fellowships they're amongst
[1:21:08] believers that are on fire and that
[1:21:10] flame their flame that they are and that
[1:21:12] you are everyone is will be guaranteed
[1:21:13] to light each other it will keep
[1:21:15] everyone burning and with the fire of
[1:21:17] god in between that that's right i've
[1:21:19] got this quote here brother branham said
[1:21:20] like i was saying this morning of hudson
[1:21:22] taylor me being me i'd like to know
[1:21:23] who's hudson taylor well i kind of
[1:21:25] already knew who he was
[1:21:26] he was a um hudson taylor was a um uh
[1:21:30] he was a missionary in china very
[1:21:33] um
[1:21:34] a lot of the there is a still a big
[1:21:36] missionary organization that go around
[1:21:37] asia and he was the one that started
[1:21:40] that organization
[1:21:41] but
[1:21:42] i actually didn't know this but when we
[1:21:44] went to china
[1:21:45] we ended up in a place that we just
[1:21:48] ended up there we didn't know where it
[1:21:49] was and
[1:21:50] what was actually in this hudson
[1:21:51] taylor's hometown that where we ended up
[1:21:53] living in taiwan and you know we didn't
[1:21:56] go there andy you went to south china
[1:21:57] tie you in and so i actually went to
[1:21:59] hudson taylor's house in china where he
[1:22:02] where he lived there
[1:22:04] but brother branham's got this quote i
[1:22:05] want to read it he said like i was
[1:22:07] saying this morning of hudson taylor
[1:22:09] when a man told him a young chinese boy
[1:22:10] said mr taylor i have just received
[1:22:12] christ it's burning in my heart
[1:22:15] that's what christ does
[1:22:17] now i'll have to have four years to get
[1:22:20] my my ba and my doctor's degree and so
[1:22:22] forth
[1:22:23] mr taylor said don't wait till the
[1:22:25] candle's half burnt before you try and
[1:22:27] try to show your light said go do it now
[1:22:31] you're on fire man what are you waiting
[1:22:32] for
[1:22:33] just go you know this is what it's all
[1:22:36] about that fire it's not learning what
[1:22:38] it is it's it that's it you don't need
[1:22:39] to learn about that just let that burn
[1:22:41] just put fuel on it it'll just burn
[1:22:43] amen that's right don't worry around
[1:22:45] this that or the other great big schools
[1:22:47] of theology they're right they was in
[1:22:49] the days gone by but brother what we
[1:22:51] need today is not a school of theology
[1:22:53] we need some lit candles
[1:22:56] listen
[1:22:58] if you don't know
[1:22:59] know more about it go tell them how it
[1:23:01] got lit and let them light off of that
[1:23:04] and somebody light off of that we'll
[1:23:05] have another return to pentecost because
[1:23:07] that's what happened there
[1:23:08] that's right just as soon as it's lit
[1:23:10] that's all you know about it go tell
[1:23:12] someone else how it got lit
[1:23:14] sometimes the cemetery that was a stroke
[1:23:16] or seminaries takes all takes all the
[1:23:18] light out of you that's right you're
[1:23:21] persistent
[1:23:22] just tell them how you got lit say i was
[1:23:24] standing there and all at once the holy
[1:23:25] ghost fell on me if you'll do the same
[1:23:27] thing it'll happen to you tell that much
[1:23:29] if that's all you know then just tell
[1:23:31] that's enough
[1:23:32] hey what more could you what what more
[1:23:34] what greater thing is than getting lit
[1:23:36] by the fire of god so if you've been lit
[1:23:38] on fire just tell someone this is how i
[1:23:39] got lit this is it
[1:23:41] at the end of the day that's what that's
[1:23:42] what god the gospel is all about is the
[1:23:44] fire of god lighting people's hearts so
[1:23:46] if you're on fire just hey i'm on fire
[1:23:48] you want to know about it you want to do
[1:23:50] you want to know how it happened
[1:23:52] do you want to know something because
[1:23:53] and the more you put fuel on that the
[1:23:54] more it will just burn it it doesn't
[1:23:56] have to be taut it doesn't have to be it
[1:23:58] doesn't need man's
[1:23:59] it's not a man fire it's a god fire it
[1:24:01] just you just put spiritual wood on it
[1:24:03] it just keeps on burning man doesn't
[1:24:05] have to do anything to make it work it's
[1:24:06] not from man that spark
[1:24:08] of this fire of god in our life didn't
[1:24:10] come from man so you don't man doesn't
[1:24:12] need to mess with it
[1:24:13] i've got another fact
[1:24:15] that i thought was very interesting i
[1:24:16] like this there's only fire on earth
[1:24:18] you ever thought about that
[1:24:20] there's there's only fire on earth fire
[1:24:22] is just reserved for us you know
[1:24:25] because it needs oxygen there's no
[1:24:27] oxygen anywhere else so this this
[1:24:28] reaction called fire is it's just for us
[1:24:31] you know it's like you know people think
[1:24:33] is their life out there i don't know
[1:24:34] last i checked there wasn't
[1:24:37] the last sign to subject there wasn't
[1:24:39] but you know there's life here
[1:24:40] and where life is is where the fire of
[1:24:42] god wants to be so it's a spiritual type
[1:24:45] you know like you can only have this
[1:24:46] fire here god's just interested we might
[1:24:49] be this insignificant planet but god's
[1:24:51] interested in us here
[1:24:52] and this is where he allows fire to
[1:24:54] happen here because he wants his fire to
[1:24:56] come and be with us here now we might
[1:24:58] think
[1:24:59] you know oh this is modern day we don't
[1:25:01] really use fire these days who thinks
[1:25:02] that you know who's like when was the
[1:25:03] last time you lit a fire
[1:25:06] like this year
[1:25:08] that's oh you've got to fight okay some
[1:25:10] people still have fireplaces in their
[1:25:11] homes right but if you don't if you
[1:25:12] don't have a fireplace there's a good
[1:25:14] chance you think man i haven't lit in a
[1:25:15] fire or seen a fire for oh yeah you know
[1:25:18] never even had a lighter in your hand or
[1:25:19] a candle
[1:25:20] maybe romantic people looking candles
[1:25:22] but
[1:25:24] but you know
[1:25:25] the the simple fact is we use fire is
[1:25:27] still an integral part of our life
[1:25:29] you know it's
[1:25:31] down to very simple basic technology of
[1:25:33] driving a vehicle all that is it's just
[1:25:34] setting gasoline on fire
[1:25:36] and it blows up and then our car moves
[1:25:38] along a bit because it turns the piston
[1:25:40] and then another bit of fire
[1:25:42] petrol blows up you know it's basically
[1:25:44] a lighter doing this
[1:25:45] and
[1:25:47] we you that we basically drive around a
[1:25:48] piece of fire you know well you know you
[1:25:51] think oh that's why you say let's walk
[1:25:53] i'll warm up the car what you're meaning
[1:25:55] is i'm gonna i'm gonna set this car on
[1:25:57] fire
[1:25:58] you know i'm gonna start the fire in the
[1:26:00] car that's what you do you know you have
[1:26:01] this modern key and everything looks all
[1:26:03] modern and slick all you're doing is
[1:26:04] starting a fire in your car
[1:26:06] you know you think i need some heat
[1:26:09] we're gonna it's gonna blow up this air
[1:26:10] that happens because you're little fire
[1:26:11] in the bonnet you know and you some of
[1:26:13] it's even modern you push a button but
[1:26:14] all it's doing is starting a fire in
[1:26:16] your engine
[1:26:18] it's just all contained so it doesn't
[1:26:19] blow the whole thing up but it's just
[1:26:21] and that's what it makes the sound boom
[1:26:22] boom boom boom boom you're burning fire
[1:26:25] and
[1:26:26] you know like even everything that you
[1:26:27] touch like all this it's all been molten
[1:26:29] the it takes fire to and these
[1:26:33] um to mold all this iron and all these
[1:26:35] things here just that that's all been
[1:26:37] made with fire all your phones
[1:26:38] everything it's all
[1:26:39] we actually if we took away fire from
[1:26:41] our existence we wouldn't really exist
[1:26:43] in the capacity that we know today and
[1:26:45] you know even so much so that part of
[1:26:47] the major problem that some would say
[1:26:49] that we've got today is that we're
[1:26:50] actually burning too much fire you know
[1:26:52] this we think oh fire it's a thing of
[1:26:54] the past
[1:26:55] there's because when you when you burn
[1:26:56] fire it creates carbon dioxide as the
[1:26:58] byproduct of it and that goes into the
[1:26:59] atmosphere you know and then you get
[1:27:01] more carbon dioxide there's no more
[1:27:03] carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now the
[1:27:04] more it was when people use fire for
[1:27:06] everything apparently
[1:27:08] there's there are there are more now
[1:27:10] because we're actually burning more fire
[1:27:11] now than what we ever used to there's
[1:27:13] just fire fire fire everywhere we're
[1:27:15] just burning starting off with our
[1:27:16] vehicles every one of us burn a fire
[1:27:18] every day if you commute for an hour
[1:27:19] you're burning a fire for an hour every
[1:27:21] day if there's five of you in the family
[1:27:23] you know you only have one fire in the
[1:27:24] house so that was divided by five now
[1:27:26] you five drive a vehicle you're burning
[1:27:28] fire fires you know
[1:27:30] we there's a lot of fire going on these
[1:27:31] days so if you think oh fire's the thing
[1:27:33] of the past it's not really we use we we
[1:27:35] all use fire these days i want to talk
[1:27:37] about fire as judgment because you know
[1:27:41] a lot of times and through especially
[1:27:43] through the old testament god used fire
[1:27:45] fire was a form of judgment upon people
[1:27:46] was this was fire i've just got some
[1:27:49] scriptures on that and when the people
[1:27:51] complained it displeased the lord
[1:27:53] because god had done so many things and
[1:27:54] they just kept on complaining the
[1:27:55] children of israel
[1:27:57] and the lord heard it and his anger was
[1:27:58] kindled and a fire of the lord burned
[1:28:00] among them so fire burned among them and
[1:28:03] consumed them that were in the outermost
[1:28:04] parts of the camp and the people cried
[1:28:06] unto moses and when moses prayed unto
[1:28:07] the lord the fire was quenched
[1:28:09] and he called the name of the place
[1:28:11] tebura because the fire of the lord
[1:28:14] burnt among them god used fire as a
[1:28:16] judgment because fire has got a
[1:28:17] consuming capability to do something
[1:28:19] that is
[1:28:20] to make it is not you know it's there
[1:28:22] now it's gone
[1:28:23] and and this fire has a capacity to do
[1:28:25] that to take something that exists make
[1:28:27] it not exist like
[1:28:28] this pulpit here could be burnt with
[1:28:30] fire and the majority of it would be
[1:28:32] turned back into
[1:28:33] something that it's like a
[1:28:35] you know like a tree like a fire is just
[1:28:37] burning stored energy like a tree going
[1:28:39] in reverse essentially because the sun
[1:28:41] shines energy down it makes
[1:28:43] photosynthesizes that plant and makes it
[1:28:44] grow up and it stores this energy inside
[1:28:46] it all a fire does is reverse that
[1:28:49] process and bring it back the other way
[1:28:50] because there's energy in it and it just
[1:28:51] releases it
[1:28:52] it's like a tree growing in reverse is
[1:28:54] when you catch something on fire it's
[1:28:56] using up stored energy that was housed
[1:28:58] in it
[1:29:00] here's another one that you all know
[1:29:01] sodom and gomorrah when the synod got so
[1:29:03] bad and god wanted to destroy it he used
[1:29:05] fire to destroy it and the lord reigned
[1:29:07] upon sodom and gomorrah brimstone and
[1:29:09] fire from the lord out of heaven i don't
[1:29:10] know how that worked but i can assure
[1:29:12] you something came out of heaven and
[1:29:13] burnt the place
[1:29:15] i don't know scientifically how it works
[1:29:16] but that's what happened it's like the
[1:29:18] red sea you know people say how did the
[1:29:19] how did the sea open up how did they go
[1:29:21] across
[1:29:22] you know if you blow if because the
[1:29:24] bible said in east wind blue if you blow
[1:29:26] on something for long enough you're
[1:29:27] gonna form ice right you
[1:29:30] like you go on an aeroplane that's why
[1:29:31] you get ice particles form outside
[1:29:32] windows on airplanes and there because
[1:29:33] it's the the air moving really fast
[1:29:36] creates gets really cold and creates ice
[1:29:39] so
[1:29:39] one man said you know it's very possible
[1:29:41] if you blow ice if you blow water like a
[1:29:43] fire blow a powerful water down on a
[1:29:46] stream of water it will actually get
[1:29:47] cold and cold and it will form it will
[1:29:48] form ice walls there and i could i could
[1:29:50] walk across the bible said in east wind
[1:29:52] blue is that how it happened probably i
[1:29:54] don't know but that could scientifically
[1:29:56] happen right
[1:29:58] and
[1:29:59] and all is here's another one in all
[1:30:01] israel we're around about then this is
[1:30:02] when um
[1:30:03] dathan and what was the other person's
[1:30:05] name
[1:30:06] right when they when they
[1:30:09] god opened up the earth and swallowed
[1:30:11] them up with the earthquake
[1:30:13] but then there were still people that
[1:30:15] didn't fall down in that chasm and all
[1:30:17] israel were around about and the people
[1:30:19] that were still there fled at the cry of
[1:30:21] therefore they said lest the earth
[1:30:22] swallow us up so the people that were
[1:30:24] left ran away and then it says and they
[1:30:25] came out a fire from the lord and
[1:30:28] consumed the 250 men that offered
[1:30:30] incense
[1:30:31] so
[1:30:32] the ones that didn't fall down he
[1:30:33] destroyed them with fire here's another
[1:30:35] one and elijah answered and said unto
[1:30:37] the captain of 50. if i be a man of god
[1:30:40] then let fire come down from heaven and
[1:30:41] consume thee 50.
[1:30:43] and there came down
[1:30:45] fire from heaven and consumed him and
[1:30:47] his 50.
[1:30:49] and he did that three times
[1:30:51] sometimes i wonder what were these guys
[1:30:52] thinking this
[1:30:54] 50 men went up and they got burned with
[1:30:55] fire and then they sent another 50 and
[1:30:57] it happened again
[1:30:58] i think man after one time i'm not going
[1:31:00] up there
[1:31:00] say what you want you know i'm not going
[1:31:03] up
[1:31:04] and
[1:31:05] here's i just want to talk about this
[1:31:07] for a bit about god and himself being a
[1:31:09] consuming fire because a lot of the
[1:31:10] times this one here is when
[1:31:12] when the angel came to gabriel and he
[1:31:14] said prepare this prepare some cakes
[1:31:16] prepare that and the angel of the lord
[1:31:18] we need to finish that the angel of the
[1:31:19] lord touched the rock and a fire came
[1:31:21] out and consumed the sacrifice
[1:31:23] you know god's a consuming fire and
[1:31:24] that's that's a that's like a type in
[1:31:26] our life we offer something to the lord
[1:31:27] and the fire of god will consume it
[1:31:30] and that's why i think we talked about
[1:31:32] this last week in gideon once it's
[1:31:33] happened gideon perceived that he was an
[1:31:34] angel of the lord gideon said alas o god
[1:31:36] for because i've seen an angel of the
[1:31:38] lord face to face and the lord said unto
[1:31:40] him peace
[1:31:41] be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die
[1:31:43] then gideon built an altar there unto
[1:31:44] the lord and called it jehovah shalom so
[1:31:46] that's the place where god consumed his
[1:31:48] fire this is another common one that
[1:31:50] you'll all know when elijah was praying
[1:31:53] and you know the prophets of baal were
[1:31:55] there and and
[1:31:56] then the fire of god came down this must
[1:31:59] have been a very very special fire
[1:32:00] because it said it consumed the rocks
[1:32:03] last time i checked rocks weren't really
[1:32:05] hydrocarbon they generally but i think
[1:32:08] you probably could get some fire hot
[1:32:09] enough to burn to
[1:32:11] burn rocks
[1:32:12] you know like 5 000 degrees fahrenheit
[1:32:14] you probably can burn some rocks but
[1:32:15] this fire here that came down
[1:32:17] burnt the wood that burned the meat and
[1:32:19] then burnt the water evaporated the
[1:32:20] water and burnt the rocks
[1:32:22] and it disintegrated the whole thing
[1:32:24] that's the power of fire one more where
[1:32:27] where
[1:32:28] solomon when they when he built the
[1:32:29] temple they offered all the sacrifices
[1:32:31] it said the fire of god came down and
[1:32:32] consumed the sacrifice just came down
[1:32:36] this is the god we serve god loves to
[1:32:38] display himself in fire he's a fire
[1:32:41] breathing god
[1:32:42] and we get near to god we get on fire we
[1:32:44] get this fire in us that's that's
[1:32:46] christians are full of fire
[1:32:48] we're just that that's what we're like
[1:32:49] we're full of fire
[1:32:52] and god's not scared of fire
[1:32:54] lo he said this is the
[1:32:57] lo i see four men loose walking in the
[1:32:59] midst of the fire
[1:33:01] and they have no hurt and the form of
[1:33:02] the force is like the son of god so this
[1:33:05] natural fire is not going to do anything
[1:33:06] to the god of fire just walks in the
[1:33:08] fire this is nothing you think this fire
[1:33:10] is bright you wait till you see the fire
[1:33:11] of my fire this is just your natural
[1:33:13] fire which types of spiritual thing you
[1:33:15] know the natural fire just types the
[1:33:17] spiritual fire of god far more powerful
[1:33:19] far more effective than this natural
[1:33:21] fire that can't even burn you know has a
[1:33:23] hard time burning steel you know god's
[1:33:24] fire just evaporates things
[1:33:28] and
[1:33:29] i want to talk a bit about god's about
[1:33:30] fire being an attribute of god
[1:33:32] because and how god uses fire in our
[1:33:35] life and here's this one here that the
[1:33:37] trial of your faith being much more
[1:33:39] precious than of gold that perisheth
[1:33:41] thou be tried with fire might be found
[1:33:44] unto praise and honor and glory at the
[1:33:45] appearing of jesus christ so
[1:33:47] god uses his fire to
[1:33:49] to burn out any unbelief to to try our
[1:33:52] faith you know it's now fire makes
[1:33:55] things hot and makes things intense it
[1:33:57] gets rid of things that shouldn't be
[1:33:58] there it it disrupts things you know you
[1:34:01] put a fire through a place it's probably
[1:34:02] not going to look the same as what it
[1:34:03] was before the fire went there if god
[1:34:05] comes in and if the fire of god goes
[1:34:07] into your life and goes somewhere does
[1:34:08] something it's going to have an effect
[1:34:10] it doesn't just sort of pass through oh
[1:34:11] did you hear the fire went through the
[1:34:13] city i wouldn't have thought wouldn't
[1:34:15] have guessed you know for fire went
[1:34:16] through the city half the city's gone
[1:34:19] and when the fire of god comes in and
[1:34:21] god uses his fire to refine us to refine
[1:34:24] our faith
[1:34:25] and i like this type here that the
[1:34:28] the things god references that his
[1:34:30] things are unburnable by this fire that
[1:34:32] that
[1:34:33] there are there's a certain substance
[1:34:35] which are the things of god that his
[1:34:37] fire
[1:34:38] they they stay when the fire is burnt
[1:34:40] they stay there
[1:34:41] you understand this that's an important
[1:34:43] principle because there there are things
[1:34:44] that when the fire of god burns they're
[1:34:46] gone they don't exist anymore they've
[1:34:48] been broken down to
[1:34:49] their temporal and that's what you call
[1:34:51] eternal things and temporal things and
[1:34:52] there are a lot of natural and spiritual
[1:34:55] temporal things that the fire of god is
[1:34:57] going to burn naturally and spiritually
[1:34:58] that they're not going to be there
[1:34:59] anymore that's why we say don't focus on
[1:35:01] natural things too much because
[1:35:03] eventually the fire of god is going to
[1:35:04] burn everything
[1:35:06] that will be
[1:35:07] that will that will eventually burn out
[1:35:09] but the things of god are unburnable so
[1:35:12] our we need our faith
[1:35:14] our faith is an attribute of god and all
[1:35:16] this the love the actual attributes of
[1:35:18] god are unburnable when the fire of god
[1:35:20] comes in those things stay it's all hate
[1:35:24] jealousy
[1:35:25] wrong doing things of satan things of
[1:35:26] the world those things are burnable when
[1:35:28] the fire of god comes in they burn they
[1:35:31] they don't exist and that's what we want
[1:35:32] is those things to burn
[1:35:34] and for our faith this is why
[1:35:36] corinthians it says for other foundation
[1:35:38] can no man lay than that which is laid
[1:35:40] which is jesus christ talking about the
[1:35:42] foundation of a believer is christ
[1:35:44] coming into them right and that's that's
[1:35:46] that's like an unburnable substance
[1:35:48] that's god himself
[1:35:50] now if any man build upon this
[1:35:51] foundation gold silver precious stones
[1:35:55] so you can you can build the things of
[1:35:56] god and you could encourage a believer
[1:35:58] to
[1:35:59] to to do right to do the right thing and
[1:36:01] to and the genuine word of god and build
[1:36:03] the house by the word of god and that
[1:36:05] you could do that or you could just
[1:36:06] encourage them to do something that's
[1:36:08] not that because it says you can build
[1:36:10] on that precious stones wood hay or
[1:36:12] stubble another substance that's not
[1:36:14] that and he says every man's work shall
[1:36:16] be made manifest for the day shall
[1:36:18] declare it because it shall be revealed
[1:36:20] by fire meaning one day this fire of god
[1:36:22] is going to burn that person
[1:36:24] and all that work and to see which stuff
[1:36:28] who sowed into his life you guys all did
[1:36:29] okay let's see which one which of you
[1:36:31] people sowed the true word of god the
[1:36:33] things of god that are going to stay and
[1:36:35] which ones have you sowed this nonsense
[1:36:37] on their life that's going to be gone
[1:36:38] once i put this fire on it and it gets
[1:36:40] burnt
[1:36:41] you know and if you wasted your time
[1:36:42] with people in building this other
[1:36:43] nonsense in their life and encourage
[1:36:45] them to do certain things that's just of
[1:36:46] the world and no substance there's a
[1:36:49] time where that's going to be gone
[1:36:50] it'll be gone and you'll be like you
[1:36:52] know and it says here that you'll still
[1:36:54] be saved you know because you're going
[1:36:55] to look at your work and think well that
[1:36:56] was a complete waste of time wasn't it
[1:36:58] all that work i did look it's all gone
[1:36:59] because it wasn't a true it wasn't god's
[1:37:02] substance it was just the man-made it
[1:37:03] was
[1:37:04] you know so we
[1:37:06] and that's what this here is you know
[1:37:08] you put a fire on this i tell you one
[1:37:10] pile is going to stay one pile is going
[1:37:11] to go
[1:37:12] so so when you're sowing into people's
[1:37:14] lives when you're building the work of
[1:37:16] god
[1:37:17] make sure you're building the right
[1:37:18] thing because you can easily we can
[1:37:19] easily and even in our own lives we can
[1:37:20] easily let this stubble this stuff be
[1:37:23] built up
[1:37:24] that's why god says i counsel thee to
[1:37:26] buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[1:37:28] you might be rich because in this age
[1:37:30] we're chasing after natural things god's
[1:37:32] saying that's all just going to burn
[1:37:34] my fire will come and burn that
[1:37:36] naturally and spiritually that naturally
[1:37:38] it's going to burn and spiritually that
[1:37:39] desire that wants that is going to burn
[1:37:41] too that's that's of no substance either
[1:37:43] so naturally and spiritually a natural
[1:37:44] fire is going to burn on this and a
[1:37:45] spiritual fire is going to burn if that
[1:37:47] was your desire it's going to burn that
[1:37:48] too but he's saying buy of me gold tried
[1:37:51] in the fire real substance the the
[1:37:54] unadulterated word of god get have that
[1:37:56] in your life you know come and get that
[1:37:58] from me that's what matters
[1:38:00] and because
[1:38:02] that fire is going to burn everything
[1:38:04] you know
[1:38:05] this could just be the gospel according
[1:38:07] to isaac and this is just in fellowship
[1:38:08] you know but we when you think of the
[1:38:09] fires of hell you think that's a bad
[1:38:11] fire but you know i often think based on
[1:38:13] that
[1:38:14] more than likely that fire of that that
[1:38:16] the fire there is probably more than
[1:38:18] likely the fire of god
[1:38:20] it's because it's going to burn up
[1:38:23] there's a certain point where see
[1:38:25] natural fire can destroy natural things
[1:38:27] i think the spiritual fire can destroy
[1:38:28] spiritual things right so that this this
[1:38:31] same spiritual fire that burns in our
[1:38:33] heart and that burns out the the the
[1:38:35] unbelief and out of our life is the same
[1:38:38] fire that's going to burn
[1:38:40] the
[1:38:40] source of all unbelief and all sin and
[1:38:42] everything that's there it's going to
[1:38:44] burn all that because it's all carbon
[1:38:46] it's all um hydrocarbon sitting in there
[1:38:48] it's not gold that can stay it will all
[1:38:50] actually
[1:38:51] it's all going to burn and i believe
[1:38:53] that the that
[1:38:55] when i look at it that fire of god is
[1:38:57] that's what's going to burn all that
[1:38:58] eventually it will become no more
[1:39:01] that this fire of god is going to burn
[1:39:02] all that stuff just like it's going to
[1:39:04] burn all this world naturally
[1:39:06] i want to just do this and i've got two
[1:39:08] more thoughts for you this morning
[1:39:10] this is a i want to talk about the fire
[1:39:12] of god setting us free
[1:39:13] but i want to
[1:39:15] you know we often like who likes freedom
[1:39:19] freedoms good day you know i often think
[1:39:21] you know there's no real such thing as
[1:39:23] freedom in it and if you just put the
[1:39:24] word like i'm free well there are there
[1:39:26] is but
[1:39:27] you say what are you talking about
[1:39:29] well when you talk about the word free
[1:39:31] you have to be associated with free from
[1:39:33] something like you say if brother ed
[1:39:35] says i'm free
[1:39:36] say i'm free i'm free hey praise the
[1:39:41] see because it has to be in relation to
[1:39:43] something you cannot just be free it's
[1:39:45] like okay what are you free from oh well
[1:39:47] i'm free from this oh i see that's
[1:39:49] you know you can't just exist in freedom
[1:39:50] on its own it has to be from something
[1:39:53] that's why
[1:39:54] that's why you've got two sides of the
[1:39:56] story of this perceived freedom like
[1:39:58] someone would say oh i'm sick of being
[1:40:00] having to be dragged along to church and
[1:40:02] do the things of god and that i want to
[1:40:03] be free from that
[1:40:05] so then they go into the world and and
[1:40:07] they say now i'm free
[1:40:09] well
[1:40:10] you're free from
[1:40:12] that right that's what you're saying in
[1:40:13] fact now you're in bondage to something
[1:40:15] else because everyone is
[1:40:16] everybody is in bondage to something
[1:40:18] right there's no such thing as freedom
[1:40:20] in that sense we're all in bondage of
[1:40:22] something so we we're free from that
[1:40:24] chain me up to you
[1:40:26] right now that's why paul says
[1:40:28] i'm free in christ so he now says i
[1:40:30] don't want the things of the world i'm
[1:40:31] free over here and the lord says and he
[1:40:33] he's now a prisoner of christ right
[1:40:35] chained up to here see so
[1:40:38] there's no real freedom it's just i'm it
[1:40:40] just depends on the revelation god's
[1:40:42] given you i'd rather be free from sin
[1:40:43] and a prisoner to christ then free from
[1:40:46] christ than a prisoner to death you know
[1:40:49] and and that's what this picture here
[1:40:51] i'm gonna if i could if i could in my
[1:40:53] mind just put an image to it you know
[1:40:55] no one's really free right let's get
[1:40:57] that idea out of our mind no one's
[1:40:59] we're a prisoner to somebody you know
[1:41:02] that's like this brother brandon had
[1:41:03] those t-shirts i'm a fool for christ he
[1:41:05] saw that slogan i'm a fool for christ
[1:41:06] who's full of you
[1:41:08] because we're all somebody's full we're
[1:41:10] we're a prisoner to somebody and this
[1:41:12] essentially is how is how it is in each
[1:41:14] one of our lives you know this one on
[1:41:16] and but you know when we talk about the
[1:41:19] fire of god if i could analyze it and
[1:41:21] sort of put it in a visual context you
[1:41:23] know
[1:41:24] you know we talked about breaking the
[1:41:25] chains but you know it's not really the
[1:41:27] chain these chains that hold us are
[1:41:28] powerful things i don't know give too
[1:41:29] much credit but chains i don't think
[1:41:31] humans can break these chains like that
[1:41:33] the chains of the power of god and the
[1:41:35] chains of the power of satan are very
[1:41:36] powerful
[1:41:37] they're hard you know this is just an
[1:41:39] analogy right to break
[1:41:41] it's not the chains that break it's
[1:41:42] almost like
[1:41:44] like when satan puts something on us
[1:41:46] like his wrong idea it's like it's like
[1:41:48] we take it and it gets fixed onto us you
[1:41:50] know and then his chain has got a little
[1:41:52] special you know you have couplings and
[1:41:54] like this certain
[1:41:55] like a vehicle's got a tow ball and then
[1:41:57] this here we'll hook on to that you know
[1:41:58] and it's compatible sometimes when you
[1:42:00] get the wrong size toe ball you go to
[1:42:01] put a toe ball on there it's like oh
[1:42:02] that that that's different than that so
[1:42:04] i won't hook on but you know satan satan
[1:42:06] puts what he does he puts his he puts
[1:42:08] his lies on you puts this thing he says
[1:42:10] he take this and it hooks on you and
[1:42:12] then he chains on to that and that's
[1:42:13] what holds you is that he's got an
[1:42:15] anchor point in your life you know and
[1:42:16] the more you accept all of his ways he
[1:42:18] just gives you more and because you take
[1:42:19] this you take it hooks on that which you
[1:42:21] end up like this you end up with all
[1:42:23] these anchors on you and you're chained
[1:42:24] you know now good luck trying to break
[1:42:26] those chains they're powerful you know
[1:42:28] but that's not really what
[1:42:30] i'll just keep going on but
[1:42:33] this one here right i put this one here
[1:42:35] and as well because you know
[1:42:37] to visualize what happens when sometimes
[1:42:39] people cannot have a not have been moved
[1:42:42] by the power of god not have a real
[1:42:43] experience with god but still try to go
[1:42:44] to church essentially just end up like
[1:42:46] this where
[1:42:47] you've got these chains that like you're
[1:42:50] you think i should really go to church
[1:42:51] because i should be a good person and i
[1:42:53] should do that you know
[1:42:54] that that's what that is i'm you know or
[1:42:56] i shouldn't sin because that would be
[1:42:58] wrong so but it's a natural
[1:43:00] you know because there is a natural we
[1:43:02] can naturally be good you know like not
[1:43:03] not everyone that
[1:43:05] like you understand
[1:43:07] this is what brother brown talks about
[1:43:08] you know can have just as enough
[1:43:10] christianity to make you miserable right
[1:43:12] because you kind of you're sort of being
[1:43:14] pulled this way pulled that way but
[1:43:15] you've you know
[1:43:16] it's all just making this is a miserable
[1:43:18] state because you know you kind of
[1:43:20] it's it's this is a you can be a
[1:43:22] man-made christian quite easily you know
[1:43:23] i should really not do those bad things
[1:43:25] you know but it's a it's that's that can
[1:43:27] also be just another anchor and then
[1:43:29] you've got one this way and you're
[1:43:30] before you know you're the most
[1:43:31] miserable person out you know either be
[1:43:33] god says be hot or cold you know don't
[1:43:35] live in this state if you're gonna sin
[1:43:37] go that way you're gonna serve god let
[1:43:39] the fire god come in and go the other
[1:43:41] way you know
[1:43:43] but
[1:43:43] if i could put it like this too this is
[1:43:46] the way that i look at predestination
[1:43:48] you know like
[1:43:49] there's a there's a there's something in
[1:43:52] us that's the anchor point
[1:43:54] that that's held by the the chain of god
[1:43:56] that you know this is a predestinated
[1:43:58] son or daughter of god that it doesn't
[1:44:00] matter how many chains and hooks and
[1:44:02] everything the devil can have on you
[1:44:04] you can never ever be lost there's
[1:44:05] always that one chain that's eventually
[1:44:07] that's never ever going to break that's
[1:44:09] how many of you have experienced that in
[1:44:11] your life you know you you go
[1:44:12] and you you there's just something
[1:44:14] holding you when it looks like you look
[1:44:16] you see something you think man there's
[1:44:17] no hope for that person but you know if
[1:44:18] there's this here there's there's no
[1:44:20] hope for satan you know
[1:44:22] there will never be
[1:44:24] but you know this is what i want to type
[1:44:26] about the fire of god what happens
[1:44:28] in our life is
[1:44:30] is because everything of satan is
[1:44:31] temporal right it's able to be burned so
[1:44:34] if we if we get this situation here
[1:44:36] where where god is
[1:44:38] you know
[1:44:38] when the fire of gold comes into us it
[1:44:40] just it just burns out all those the
[1:44:42] lies from satan all those little anchors
[1:44:44] that he has because it's and
[1:44:47] and then the chains no longer have any
[1:44:48] effect right because it it
[1:44:50] we just get in the presence of god we
[1:44:52] don't have to try and work it out but
[1:44:53] those those things just get burnt out
[1:44:56] and that's we we then we then call
[1:44:58] ourselves you know i'm free but we're
[1:45:01] free because that thing used to hold me
[1:45:02] it's all being burnt away the chain's
[1:45:04] gone i'm i'm now i'm free from that you
[1:45:06] know and it's a real simple process
[1:45:08] there's no scientific uh answer to it
[1:45:11] you just get in the presence of god and
[1:45:12] all these things of satan just get
[1:45:14] burned away that's how the gospel works
[1:45:16] it's a supernatural occurrence you don't
[1:45:18] have to do these 10 steps to figure it
[1:45:20] all out just stay in the presence of god
[1:45:21] and this is what happens in your life if
[1:45:22] you're just new serving the lord just
[1:45:24] stand as presence all of these anchor
[1:45:26] points all of the stuff will just get
[1:45:28] burnt those chains satan will go to pull
[1:45:29] it and the whole thing will break apart
[1:45:31] because it's the anchor point's gone
[1:45:33] that's this is it's a very simple simple
[1:45:35] gospel we just let the power of god and
[1:45:37] i often look at it like this like
[1:45:39] you know we can either get tried by fire
[1:45:41] now because that's what this is we get
[1:45:42] tried by fire when we go to cross over
[1:45:45] from here to eternity it's like we have
[1:45:46] to pass through this fire you know we
[1:45:49] pass through the fire
[1:45:50] and you know it's like we swing on the
[1:45:52] on the in the crevice of eternity you
[1:45:54] know now if you've got that that if you
[1:45:56] if you've got the anchor of god on you
[1:45:58] you're going to just swing over and get
[1:45:59] to the other side you know but
[1:46:00] people if you don't have that and you go
[1:46:02] to swing over that what's going to
[1:46:03] happen to all your the the couplings
[1:46:05] you're just going to break you're going
[1:46:06] to you're done
[1:46:07] see so that's why we get we get
[1:46:10] what we're hooking on to now is going to
[1:46:12] take us from this world to the next
[1:46:14] because when we pass through that fire
[1:46:15] which everybody has to pass through that
[1:46:16] fire
[1:46:17] we're going to go through to the other
[1:46:18] side
[1:46:19] if you if you're like this you're going
[1:46:21] to swing through right because when that
[1:46:23] passes through that fire it's already
[1:46:25] been through the fire you know you're
[1:46:26] gonna make it through but if you're like
[1:46:28] that you swing through the fire like
[1:46:29] that all those the fire of god's gonna
[1:46:32] it's either gonna burn it now or then
[1:46:34] you get two options you wanna burn now
[1:46:36] burn it later on
[1:46:38] we all we are all going to pass through
[1:46:40] the fire one day
[1:46:41] and
[1:46:43] this is what i want to be when i go to
[1:46:44] pass through that fire because i know
[1:46:46] these anchor points are going to hold
[1:46:47] it's going to it's going to take me
[1:46:48] through
[1:46:49] things of the world all this natural
[1:46:50] stuff things have satan they're all just
[1:46:52] going to burn away it's not going to
[1:46:53] hold the last thought that i've got
[1:46:56] and this is kind of what i wanted to
[1:46:57] point out to us is a world that's on
[1:47:00] fire
[1:47:01] and
[1:47:03] this is this is an important point to
[1:47:05] just see the the magnitude of the the
[1:47:08] amount that the world is on fire you
[1:47:10] know and and this is a real thing this
[1:47:12] is not
[1:47:13] so
[1:47:14] we've got two fires you know i think
[1:47:16] there's two massive fires burning now
[1:47:18] there's the fire of god which we're
[1:47:19] talking about you know that's burning in
[1:47:20] brother anias's heart and this
[1:47:22] then there's this fire of lust there's
[1:47:24] this fire that's burning
[1:47:26] in the world
[1:47:27] i want to talk first about the fire of
[1:47:29] lust because this is a
[1:47:31] this is a massive thing that's happening
[1:47:32] that an actual thing that's happening
[1:47:34] let me talk first about this scripture
[1:47:36] here the bible says there are three
[1:47:38] things that are never satisfied never
[1:47:40] quenched
[1:47:41] uh
[1:47:42] one
[1:47:43] or four sorry four things that are never
[1:47:45] never quenched the grave the baron worm
[1:47:48] the earth that is not filled with water
[1:47:49] and the fire that say i thought it is
[1:47:51] enough like a fire if you put a piece of
[1:47:53] wood on a fire that won't say oh you
[1:47:55] know what i've done enough burning for
[1:47:56] the day i'll just leave that till
[1:47:57] tomorrow
[1:47:59] no it's never quenched never you put on
[1:48:02] it's going to burn it
[1:48:03] the more you put on it the more it's
[1:48:04] going to burn it will just keep burning
[1:48:05] it it never never stops it never says oh
[1:48:07] that's enough i've had enough burning
[1:48:09] for one day you give it water it's going
[1:48:10] to burn it never is satisfied never ever
[1:48:13] ever that's the
[1:48:14] and that's what solomon says
[1:48:16] the this is what fire is like you know
[1:48:18] now keep that thought in mind that this
[1:48:20] thing is never ever quenched this fire
[1:48:22] is never never quenched now the original
[1:48:24] sin that was in the garden of eden was a
[1:48:26] perversion we know that's what it was
[1:48:28] you know so
[1:48:29] as a result the the you know because
[1:48:31] they they
[1:48:32] it was a sexual act and as a result what
[1:48:34] we're going to have now that the fruit
[1:48:36] of this original seed that sin that
[1:48:38] we're in is going to have we're going to
[1:48:39] have a massive harvest
[1:48:42] now
[1:48:42] to that right that's just the way that
[1:48:44] on the laws of sowing and reaping we sow
[1:48:47] that we're going to reap that at the end
[1:48:48] massively
[1:48:50] when the bible talks about this thing of
[1:48:52] this perversion and that when it talks
[1:48:54] about it always refers to it as a fire
[1:48:56] he says can a man take a fire in his
[1:48:58] bosom and his clothes not be burned can
[1:49:00] one go upon hot coals and his feet not
[1:49:02] be burned so he that goes to his
[1:49:04] neighbor's wife whosoever touches her
[1:49:05] shall not be innocent it's always
[1:49:07] relating this thing to fire because
[1:49:08] there's there's this there's this
[1:49:10] passion this fire that's just and i'll
[1:49:12] show you that it's just burning out of
[1:49:14] control amongst this fire of perversion
[1:49:18] is has swept the world
[1:49:20] the whole world is on fire with it it's
[1:49:22] just burning the world up like you
[1:49:24] wouldn't believe
[1:49:26] like never ever before have we had such
[1:49:28] a fire of this perversion in the history
[1:49:30] of mankind every time it happened god
[1:49:32] would destroy that little place like
[1:49:35] like we talk about sodom and gomorrah
[1:49:36] that was what was happening there was
[1:49:37] this fire of perversion was burning
[1:49:40] there that the that you gotta the the
[1:49:43] your answer fire with fire you know that
[1:49:44] it's like god sort of judges it with the
[1:49:46] same thing that it is you know so
[1:49:47] because that was fire of perversion
[1:49:49] burning god just burned it with fire but
[1:49:51] any time it gets to that point god stops
[1:49:53] it and this is this one here and
[1:49:54] likewise also the men leaving the
[1:49:56] natural use of women burned in their
[1:49:58] lust one toward another it always refers
[1:50:00] to it as a burning
[1:50:02] men with men working that which is
[1:50:03] unseemly and receiving them to unto
[1:50:04] themselves
[1:50:06] the recompense and error which was met
[1:50:07] now the reason why i say
[1:50:09] why this why are related to burning is
[1:50:11] because it's something that if you let
[1:50:12] it burn out of control it just keeps
[1:50:14] burning
[1:50:15] this this whole perversion this desire
[1:50:16] thing it it just burns it doesn't say oh
[1:50:19] and i've had enough it'll that's why
[1:50:20] it's so popular why it sells because
[1:50:22] it's just burning it just you know you
[1:50:24] could put a whole lot of fuel on it one
[1:50:25] day you think oh that should be enough
[1:50:27] for the day the next day you can throw a
[1:50:28] whole lot more fuel on it and we'll burn
[1:50:29] it all again
[1:50:31] that's why they say i don't like using
[1:50:32] the whip that's why they say sex cells
[1:50:34] because it just burns the next day burn
[1:50:36] burn and ever it's just burns burns it
[1:50:38] doesn't have an end to how much it burns
[1:50:40] you understand it just
[1:50:42] it will just stop
[1:50:43] then and the bible explicitly talks now
[1:50:45] this is not just about what people do
[1:50:47] this is about what people look at all
[1:50:49] the pornography all that sort of stuff
[1:50:50] it's just a it's a flaming inferno in
[1:50:52] the world
[1:50:53] flee fornication every sin that man does
[1:50:55] without the body but he that committed
[1:50:57] his fornication sinners against his own
[1:50:58] body there's mankind just got this
[1:51:01] damnation against themselves you know
[1:51:02] like not everyone is a thief not
[1:51:04] everyone is a murderer but you'll find
[1:51:06] the majority of the unbelievers almost
[1:51:08] everyone that's not filled with the fire
[1:51:10] of god are filled with this fire in them
[1:51:11] now
[1:51:12] everybody the world is on fire whether
[1:51:14] you're going to either begin to be on
[1:51:16] fire with the fire of god or with this
[1:51:17] fire of lust and this fire of perversion
[1:51:19] it's just burnt the whole world up
[1:51:20] you're going to spend time with people
[1:51:22] they'll just commit you that it's just
[1:51:24] it's just
[1:51:25] this is why i want to this is my analogy
[1:51:27] of it like now god knew that's what god
[1:51:29] knew he was dealing with fire you know
[1:51:30] with adam and eve when he did what they
[1:51:31] were did he's like i'm now dealing with
[1:51:33] fire here
[1:51:34] this thing is fire so he had specific
[1:51:37] guidelines of this is how you can this
[1:51:39] is how you can control this fire this
[1:51:40] way you said you can have a man and a
[1:51:42] woman with anyone else you get together
[1:51:44] you'll be married and that's you you
[1:51:45] contain it and then that's that's that's
[1:51:48] how you do and i'm going to liken that
[1:51:49] to a fireplace like this you know it's a
[1:51:51] it's it's a dangerous apparatus a
[1:51:53] fireplace but if you have it within this
[1:51:55] means you can put a fire in there you
[1:51:57] can burn it and it's going to work for
[1:51:59] you right you can contain this fire it's
[1:52:00] in it and it will do all right
[1:52:02] i'm going to liken that that's like god
[1:52:04] how he said this is how you control it
[1:52:06] he knew it was fire so he said this is
[1:52:08] how you do it you control it this way if
[1:52:09] you open that door of the fire and let
[1:52:11] the embers go on the ground and let it
[1:52:12] go what will that fire do it looks all
[1:52:13] nice and cuddly and warm we'll look at
[1:52:15] that nice fire sparks
[1:52:18] you know a little sound of the kindling
[1:52:20] crackling you open the door and let some
[1:52:22] of the embers go on the ground what's
[1:52:24] going to happen that fire is going to
[1:52:25] burn your house down
[1:52:26] it's a lethal evil
[1:52:28] this hair is lethal and it has no mercy
[1:52:30] a fire won't just stop if it's dry i'm
[1:52:32] going to burn it ain't going to stop
[1:52:34] it's going to burn the house down and
[1:52:35] let me tell you this like in this day
[1:52:37] and age because people haven't done this
[1:52:39] the world is on fire they've just let
[1:52:42] the fire go everywhere it's burnt down
[1:52:43] household spiritually speaking mentally
[1:52:45] marriages everyone's perverted this it's
[1:52:47] just this raging fire has just burnt the
[1:52:50] whole world the world is if you looked
[1:52:51] at the world it's on fire with this
[1:52:53] thing
[1:52:54] it's it's literally burning on fire i
[1:52:56] don't like to read this stuff but this
[1:52:58] is what
[1:52:59] jordan peterson put in a simple way when
[1:53:01] you think of the magnitude and he
[1:53:03] couldn't perceive it but he's it's now
[1:53:04] possible for young men to see more naked
[1:53:06] women in one day than any man in history
[1:53:09] had ever seen
[1:53:11] that's not something that's not nothing
[1:53:12] that's something so he's breaking down
[1:53:14] saying this is where we're at
[1:53:16] it's now possible it's it's now
[1:53:19] we've never been here he's saying that
[1:53:21] society has never been in this
[1:53:22] predicament
[1:53:24] but what he's what he's looking at is
[1:53:26] he's saying everyone is on fire this
[1:53:28] whole thing is on fire
[1:53:29] the world if you looked at the world
[1:53:31] like this it's just burning
[1:53:33] this is why we're going to have a fiery
[1:53:34] judgment on this earth because fire is
[1:53:36] going to meet fire this is this is
[1:53:38] actually the main like the internet
[1:53:40] searches i think 20 percent of people's
[1:53:41] phones are for this perversion you're
[1:53:43] telling me that that the world consists
[1:53:44] of 20 of this there's so many other
[1:53:46] things you could research pianos cars
[1:53:49] whatever whatever 20 is this nonsense
[1:53:51] and you realize how many
[1:53:53] tera gigabytes
[1:53:55] quadrille bytes of the stuff there is
[1:53:57] and it's just about 30 of what's all
[1:53:59] online you if you put all the
[1:54:00] information in and you stacked it in
[1:54:02] photos it would fill a hole it would
[1:54:04] fill cities with photos and garbage and
[1:54:06] what the stuff is out there it's a
[1:54:08] raging inferno
[1:54:11] this is where we're at this is the and
[1:54:13] that's why the bible says flee it young
[1:54:15] men young woman flee it just flee it
[1:54:18] and but you know we've got we in this
[1:54:21] age we've got a we've got a combat you
[1:54:23] know you don't need to focus on the
[1:54:24] negative we've got a fire of god we've
[1:54:27] got a fire of god that can burn in our
[1:54:29] heart that it just burns that desire out
[1:54:31] you the more you desire the fire of god
[1:54:33] the more you let that burn in your life
[1:54:35] that doesn't that fire's no longer
[1:54:36] attractive you know you just you just
[1:54:38] want the fire of god and it it burns out
[1:54:40] the other stuff you want to overcome you
[1:54:42] just get more of the fire of god in you
[1:54:44] and amen
[1:54:45] and
[1:54:46] i want to tell you this in this day and
[1:54:48] age the world everybody's going to be on
[1:54:50] fire you're going to be on fire with one
[1:54:52] or the other that's it you're going to
[1:54:54] you're either going to be on fire with
[1:54:55] the fire of god you're going to be on
[1:54:57] fire with this fire of lust and fire of
[1:54:59] all this other perversion
[1:55:01] there's only there's going to be two
[1:55:02] fires burning in this last day and this
[1:55:04] is where we're at
[1:55:05] and that's why i say we'll be on fire
[1:55:07] i'm glad that as believers we can be on
[1:55:09] fire that god god came down that's why
[1:55:11] god came down as a fire to show i'm
[1:55:13] actually a fire too you think that's why
[1:55:15] look at this fire that's a real fire it
[1:55:17] burns out the dross and it it makes you
[1:55:20] warm with the holy ghost makes you happy
[1:55:21] it just keeps you alive that's the
[1:55:23] that's the real fire that we want and
[1:55:26] when you think about it the whole the
[1:55:27] whole everything all ends up to be in
[1:55:29] fire the whole this whole everything
[1:55:32] like this world here you got this raging
[1:55:34] inferno of fire of this perversion and
[1:55:37] that it's all going to be done away with
[1:55:39] fire you know but brother brown said
[1:55:41] that fire is just going to consume the
[1:55:42] whole lot every molecule everything's
[1:55:44] going to be gone this new heaven new
[1:55:46] earth is gonna be because the old one's
[1:55:48] just been burnt to smithereens this
[1:55:50] world's gonna end in fire you know
[1:55:52] when you go in in the in the the
[1:55:55] the lake of fire that's gonna end up in
[1:55:57] fire there's this fire of god is just
[1:55:58] gonna burn the whole lot all this
[1:56:00] unbelief all the sin all the stuff but
[1:56:01] that's that whole thing is going to burn
[1:56:03] the place where we go is going to be a
[1:56:05] place of fire you know it's just going
[1:56:06] to be
[1:56:07] but we're not going to we're not going
[1:56:08] to burn up because we're the only thing
[1:56:10] that can dwell there is that the things
[1:56:11] of god that can dwell in that presence
[1:56:13] of fire because god's still a consuming
[1:56:14] fire so it's going to be a place of this
[1:56:16] fire of god and that's why there's going
[1:56:18] to be so much love and that it's just
[1:56:19] just going to be burning everything's
[1:56:21] going to end up in fire that's that's
[1:56:23] the way it's all going to be and i'm
[1:56:24] glad that instead of being in the the
[1:56:26] lake of fire and this other you know
[1:56:28] where we where we get
[1:56:29] we disintegrate that well i'm glad that
[1:56:31] we can withstand this fire of god and
[1:56:32] just be in his presence this
[1:56:34] this pillar of fire is going to be you
[1:56:36] know the
[1:56:36] on the the great pyramid it said the the
[1:56:38] light was the lamb was the light there
[1:56:40] of you know if you get a light on top of
[1:56:41] a pyramid it just this this great light
[1:56:44] the fire of god just lights up the whole
[1:56:45] thing
[1:56:46] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:56:48] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:56:49] were passed away and there was no more
[1:56:51] sea
[1:56:53] brethren
[1:56:54] the more fire of god we get in our life
[1:56:56] the happier we are
[1:56:57] and
[1:56:58] and this is an actual this is an actual
[1:57:00] thing you know it's not just so we did
[1:57:01] we talk about it no you know it's a good
[1:57:03] story you get amongst believers you talk
[1:57:05] you get the presence of god coming
[1:57:07] there's actual fire the actual fire of
[1:57:09] god on the day of pentecost they just
[1:57:11] happened to see it you know this that's
[1:57:13] all these are is one day god just
[1:57:14] decided to come out from this pillar of
[1:57:17] fire be here now right here now
[1:57:20] he said where two or three gathered
[1:57:21] together and mine and there are months
[1:57:22] the pillar of fire is here now
[1:57:24] it's just now and then god just decided
[1:57:26] i'll just i'll just cross over to
[1:57:27] another dimension so you can just see me
[1:57:29] for a bit then i'll walk back but by
[1:57:31] faith he's here there's a fire if you're
[1:57:33] a believer that's what that's what we
[1:57:34] have we have the fire of god with us all
