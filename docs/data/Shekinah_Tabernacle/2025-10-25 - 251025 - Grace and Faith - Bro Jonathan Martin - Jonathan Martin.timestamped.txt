[7:35] Good evening.
[7:37] God bless you all. How's everyone?
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Had a wonderful day.
[7:42] enjoyed the games and fellowship and
[7:45] mainly the presence of the Lord. Amen.
[7:47] It's been so good, eh? Who enjoyed the
[7:48] service this morning? [music]
[7:50] Who had the Lord speak directly to them?
[7:53] Amen. We're so thankful for that, aren't
[7:55] we? Who's under expectation for tonight?
[7:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, the Lord's going to sweep by
[8:00] our way, touch our lives. [music] He's a
[8:03] supernatural God. Amen. The prophet said
[8:06] where he is, the supernatural is
[8:08] happening.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I believe he is here
[8:11] already and I believe he's going to do
[8:13] supernatural things. He's going to go
[8:15] beyond our expectation cuz that's he
[8:17] loves to do that kind of thing. [music]
[8:19] And I believe we're in for a treat. I
[8:21] believe that lives are going to be
[8:23] changed tonight. [music]
[8:24] &gt;&gt; And I say, Lord, start with me. Amen. So
[8:28] let's dedicate our lives to the Lord.
[8:30] Let's invite him.
[8:32] I I don't think I could ever get tired
[8:34] of saying it. He's a personal God. He
[8:36] wants to come where you are, where I am,
[8:39] and change our lives. Amen. So, you say,
[8:41] "Well, I don't have a need." Well, what
[8:42] about just just pray for the person next
[8:44] to you or maybe someone who's not even
[8:47] here.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; God can go anywhere, touch anyone.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's just commit our lives to
[8:53] the Lord. You have a need, just lift it
[8:55] before his great throne and [music]
[8:56] Amen. So, let's uh let's bow our heads,
[8:58] shall we? And let's pray. Almighty God,
[9:02] hallelujah. Lord, we're so thankful,
[9:03] Lord. We can we can praise your holy
[9:06] name, dear God. Lord, we're so glad that
[9:09] you are the great eternal one. And Lord,
[9:11] you have come down, I believe, into this
[9:13] place to have a conference with us,
[9:15] Lord, to come and change our lives,
[9:17] Lord, to meet needs, Lord, to fill us
[9:20] with your Holy Spirit, to cast out the
[9:23] enemy, Lord, to bring healing into our
[9:25] wounds, our hearts, our lives. Lord, we
[9:28] love you so much, Father. We pray, dear
[9:30] God, that your great anointing would
[9:31] overshadow us this night, Lord. May we
[9:33] be under the shadow of your great wings.
[9:35] Father, cover us in your blood. I pray
[9:37] that every spirit that's not of you
[9:38] would be bound in the name of Jesus
[9:40] Christ. The devil wouldn't be able to do
[9:42] anything in this service. May the faith
[9:44] of your people just paralyze him now in
[9:46] Jesus Christ's name. [music] And I pray,
[9:48] Father, that you would anoint brother
[9:49] Jonathan mightily, Lord. We're under
[9:50] great expectation, Lord, to hear from
[9:53] you. And we're so thankful, Lord, you
[9:55] come where you're invited. So we invite
[9:56] you here. Come by our way, Lord. Touch
[9:59] our lives, Lord. I have needs, Lord. We
[10:01] all have needs, Lord. Lord, there's
[10:03] many, Lord, on our hearts who are not
[10:05] even here. I pray you go their way,
[10:06] Lord. Those who are streaming, Lord, be
[10:08] their abundant portion, too, Lord. May
[10:10] it be like they're on the front row. The
[10:11] atmosphere is so present, Lord, of your
[10:13] presence in their in their midst
[10:15] wherever they are watching this. Dear
[10:16] God, we love you. We commit the service
[10:18] into your hands for your glory in Jesus
[10:21] Christ's name. Amen.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless.
[10:32] Lord. Hi.
[10:37] [laughter]
[10:41] &gt;&gt; How are you all?
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Like like when you're up here, even
[10:44] though there's a lot of people, you want
[10:45] to connect, you know? You got to like
[10:48] I got to get to know you. You got to get
[10:50] to know me. We got to see what we've
[10:51] [music] been up to. How's it going?
[10:52] How's how's life? You know, are you
[10:54] walking in victory?
[10:58] Are you uh overcomers?
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Okay, so there are two little principles
[11:04] that we have to sort of if we just
[11:05] dissect that real quick.
[11:08] If you walk in victory, that means you
[11:11] are a victor.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Now, in order for you to be a victor,
[11:14] you had to have someone that you had to
[11:15] victor against.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; So, you had to have some sort of
[11:19] challenge that you had to overcome. Then
[11:21] you walk in victory. So, you still
[11:22] walking in victory.
[11:25] And the same principle remains with an
[11:26] overcomer. You had to have something
[11:29] that you have to overcome.
[11:32] Like if you don't have any challenge to
[11:34] overcome, you're not you the Lord can't
[11:35] make you an overcomer.
[11:38] So we wonder why we get all these things
[11:39] in life that try and test us. It's to
[11:41] make us victors, victorious, to make us
[11:44] overcomers.
[11:47] But I know that we are that that if God
[11:50] is for us, then who can be against us?
[11:52] And I have a confidence [snorts]
[11:55] in the Lord that that even when we
[11:58] can't, he can.
[12:01] [music] Like there's a point where we
[12:03] can get pushed back, but then no more.
[12:07] Even [music] if we start losing, there's
[12:08] a point we can only lose so far. Like
[12:10] who's been down to the bottom?
[12:14] Yeah, me too. And you know what I found
[12:17] out about the bottom? And you guys that
[12:18] have and late guys and girls, brothers
[12:20] and sisters that have been there, you'll
[12:22] find the amazing principle about this
[12:24] place that we call the bottom is that
[12:27] it's actually remarkably stable.
[12:30] You can go like that. Oh, this is the
[12:31] bottom.
[12:34] And two things I learned about being at
[12:35] the very bottom. One, it's quite [music]
[12:37] stable.
[12:39] And two, the Lord is there.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; The bottom suddenly didn't become this
[12:45] dark hole that it was scary. It's like
[12:47] this is all the bottom is, is it? You
[12:49] see,
[12:50] when you're in the Lord, there's
[12:52] stability to everything. If I remember
[12:54] in the word of God, it talks about a
[12:56] bottomless pit.
[13:00] There is no bottom on that pit. There's
[13:01] a place that that a man a woman can go
[13:03] when you when you just reject everything
[13:04] that doesn't have any bottom to it. It
[13:06] just there's no there's no end to the
[13:08] depth you'll go down. It's a bottomless
[13:11] pit. Our bottom is not a bottomless pit.
[13:13] Amen.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; It's a place that has that has an end to
[13:16] it cuz the Lord said he'll not test you
[13:18] above what you're able.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; So there's a bottom to everything.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; This that the bottom ain't going to fall
[13:24] out from under you.
[13:26] The Lord's the king of the mountain and
[13:28] the king at the very bottom. Every place
[13:30] you can go. David said, "If I make my
[13:32] bed in the depths of hell, you're there.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; No matter where I go, you're there."
[13:38] That's the God we serve. It don't matter
[13:40] what situation you get into, the Lord is
[13:42] there and he's not ashamed to be with
[13:44] you in every situation.
[13:47] Like the powerful experience when I had
[13:48] when I had to walk and see my brother
[13:50] swinging on a rope dead, I thought even
[13:53] in that situation, I I'm I'm going to go
[13:55] there cuz the Lord would come here. He's
[13:56] not scared of that. He's not scared of
[13:59] anything.
[14:01] There's no no there's no place the Lord
[14:03] won't go to find [music] you and to find
[14:04] me. That's what I've learned about the
[14:07] Lord. He He's not He's a real man.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; He's strong. He's fearless.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. It's going to be such a
[14:16] good service tonight.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; We're just that the the Lord's going to
[14:19] bless us in a powerful way.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; In a in such a mighty and powerful way.
[14:25] This is a song that the the the Glors
[14:27] actually keep on introducing songs to
[14:28] the church. We've had this one for a
[14:29] while, but they always do a special and
[14:31] it's always very anointed and then we
[14:32] sing it as a you know, like a it's a new
[14:34] church song. So, this was one of the
[14:35] ones that they they they sung.

[15:17] am a lamb made for his glory. [singing]

[33:28] [applause]
[33:35] [applause]
[33:47] just as the um shakina church are coming
[33:50] up. I'll just just talk a little bit
[33:53] about uh this one and I've brother Ben
[33:56] and sister Christina are going to watch
[33:58] this one. Okay, is that all right?
[34:01] Because brother Ben wasn't at any of the
[34:02] practices anyway.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[34:07] &gt;&gt; But it kind of is nicer. I did actually
[34:09] feel in my heart that they can just sit
[34:11] down and just enjoy
[34:13] um
[34:16] their fellowship singing and praising
[34:18] the Lord. I know he'll say it's not
[34:19] mine, it's the Lords, but I want to say
[34:20] it that way. Is that right? Cuz he's got
[34:23] skin in the game or money in the bank.
[34:27] [laughter]
[34:29] So, my my um
[34:32] I was a little bit naughty this year
[34:34] writing a song because I like I've got
[34:36] about a 50% strike rate on being
[34:38] inspired and just being like my little
[34:40] musical brain figuring out things. I run
[34:42] about 50%. I I felt like the song we
[34:45] sung last night which was um Rocky
[34:46] Revelation that was kind of inspired but
[34:48] then other ones I write I just kind of
[34:50] but I wanted to challenge people this
[34:52] year a bit, you know, and have a few key
[34:53] changes and different chords and stuff
[34:55] like that.
[34:57] And um
[34:59] Latabo didn't think we could pull this
[35:00] off
[35:03] [laughter]
[35:04] and maybe we won't. It might just be
[35:06] maybe just a total flop. All right. But
[35:08] but these these brothers and sisters are
[35:11] they've done this for years now. So
[35:12] they're getting really good. And I had
[35:13] full confidence in them that you know
[35:15] you can all do this. So
[35:18] So they've yeah they've really practiced
[35:20] a lot to um yeah just to
[35:24] to do this. Plus, we've got a friendly
[35:25] competition going on with um RFBF and
[35:28] those ones that do church um items,
[35:35] man. Have you got one tomorrow, haven't
[35:36] you? Is it?
[35:39] No, it's No, we actually Yeah. You know,
[35:42] we do it for the Lord as Christians.
[35:44] Okay.
[35:47] Who laughed? [laughter]
[35:51] &gt;&gt; I was being serious, bro.

[48:37] You are my everything
[48:40] and I will [music] adore you.
[48:49] Oh, I will adore
[48:52] you.

[50:18] All [music] struck wonder
[50:22] at the mention of your name.
[50:29] Jesus, [music] your name is power,
[50:33] breath of living water,
[50:36] such a marvelous mystery.
[50:42] [music]
[50:44] Holy, holy, holy is the [music] God
[50:49] Almighty
[50:51] was
[50:54] to come.
[50:59] With all creation, I sing. Praise
[51:02] [music] to the King of Kings.
[51:06] You are my everything and I will adore
[51:12] you.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] Don't you just love praising him?
[51:32] Doesn't it just feel right being in
[51:34] [music] his presence?
[51:36] Everything just seems just seems perfect
[51:40] when you are in divine presence and all
[51:44] the worries just fade from view. The
[51:47] troubles of life fade from view.
[51:50] I believe that's why
[51:53] in a world that is falling apart,
[51:56] I believe God has so manifested [music]
[51:58] and vindicated his presence among us to
[52:02] let us know that fear not. I'm with thee
[52:07] [music]
[52:08] &gt;&gt; and I'll never leave you. I'll never
[52:10] forsake you. If you could just hear the
[52:13] voice of God speaking to your hearts
[52:15] that maybe in a more modern way of
[52:19] saying it, but I've got this.
[52:22] God would say to you young people,
[52:25] [music]
[52:25] I've got this.
[52:27] mamas and daddies and going through the
[52:32] troublesome things of life. But God just
[52:36] so real and so so present among us just
[52:41] letting you know that God is with you
[52:44] and he's walking with you and you're
[52:46] walking with him and just like Enoch
[52:49] walked with God. And then just one just
[52:52] just [music] another normal day just
[52:55] taking a walk with God and then all the
[52:58] sudden he was not for God took him home.
[53:01] I tell you you're in a supernatural walk
[53:05] and I know things [music] seem so common
[53:08] and so earthy and got bills that need to
[53:11] be paid and you're you're worried about
[53:14] your children maybe and some of the
[53:16] struggles they're going through. You may
[53:18] be going through the worst trial of your
[53:20] life when God takes you in a rapture.
[53:23] I tell you friends, there's something
[53:25] supernatural that has taken place.
[53:28] I I know the devil tries to block our
[53:31] view from it, but this message has
[53:33] placed [music] us in a supernatural walk
[53:36] with God. And we're a part of something
[53:39] that is that is so real and so dynamic.
[53:42] And and I I I believe that the rapture
[53:45] could be maybe just like a normal just
[53:48] like a meeting like this or it could
[53:50] just be a Wednesday night church service
[53:53] or it could be a Monday
[53:56] when the devil's fighting you so hard
[53:58] after a Sunday service. Hallelujah.
[54:02] There's just something real taking place
[54:04] in our lives. You know, that's why the
[54:07] Bible says don't despise the day of
[54:09] small things. I I tell you God, we heard
[54:13] it this morning. God hides himself in
[54:15] simplicity and he reveals himself in the
[54:18] same. And uh so I just want to greet you
[54:22] in the name of the Lord. And I've so uh
[54:24] so enjoyed the worship. I appreciate uh
[54:28] our brother leading us in in worship and
[54:30] and uh all of the musicians uh
[54:33] dedicating themselves to [music] uh
[54:36] create an create an atmosphere. And uh I
[54:39] believe that atmosphere is so important
[54:42] and uh I was telling uh our pastor,
[54:45] brother Ben, that the atmosphere just
[54:48] seemed uh so good and uh just feels good
[54:51] in here. And uh you know, we're in an
[54:53] atmosphere of believing and and and uh
[54:57] you know, in this kind of an atmosphere,
[54:59] all things are possible. And uh so you
[55:02] know, we uh maybe you brought some uh
[55:06] with you. you're going through some
[55:07] struggles or sickness or discouragement
[55:10] or uh maybe maybe you're feeling a
[55:13] little discouraged or backslid. Whatever
[55:15] it is, I just want to tell you this is
[55:18] your service. This is your meeting. This
[55:21] is your opportunity. And uh as we heard
[55:25] uh this morning uh God has heard the
[55:28] bleeding of the sheep and the the
[55:30] bleeding of the lambs. And I believe
[55:33] that uh I I believe that it was brother
[55:36] Brandham that said that we need that
[55:37] spirit touch. And uh cuz with that
[55:41] spirit touch, you'll go after the lost.
[55:44] You'll have a burden for the lost and
[55:46] lost souls. And you'll have a burden for
[55:48] one another. And uh so may we just uh
[55:52] have that real spirit touch moving among
[55:55] us in these services. And uh so we want
[55:58] to just say God richly bless you. It's
[56:00] just such an honor to be here and uh I
[56:04] know uh uh brother Wayne uh sends his
[56:08] greetings and uh brother Wayne would
[56:10] love to be here and and uh his heart is
[56:13] here uh with you all. Uh but uh just had
[56:18] to stay uh stay behind uh on account of
[56:21] his father and and uh so I know he would
[56:24] appreciate all of the prayers. Uh but
[56:27] you know uh what is important is that
[56:30] the Lord Jesus is here and and uh we do
[56:34] believe that that he is here and um so
[56:38] we just deem it a real honor to be here.
[56:40] My wife is here, Sister Laura, and uh
[56:43] just so glad that she could travel with
[56:45] me on this trip. And and uh we just uh
[56:49] on behalf of the church back home, True
[56:51] Word Tabernacle, and uh so many wanted
[56:54] to to greet you and and just to express
[56:57] their love to you. And uh so if you have
[57:00] your Bibles, we'll uh just turn to
[57:02] Zechariah the 4th chapter and uh we'll
[57:06] read the first seven verses. And then
[57:09] also we will read Psalms 110 and verse
[57:13] three. And just something that the Lord
[57:15] has uh been dealing with us in our
[57:19] hearts. And uh we would just uh pray
[57:21] that God
[57:24] would just uh just speak to your hearts
[57:26] and and give you strength and and uh
[57:29] just give you the the desire of your
[57:32] hearts. And [snorts] I'd like to speak
[57:35] on faith in grace.
[57:38] faith in grace and uh Zechariah the 4th
[57:42] chapter
[57:44] beginning at verse one.
[57:48] trust that everyone's had a good day and
[57:52] I so appreciate the opportunity to speak
[57:54] with brother John and I just uh have
[57:58] always been blessed by his ministry and
[58:01] his labor of love all these years uh
[58:04] ministering to God's people and uh so
[58:07] enjoyed the the service this morning and
[58:11] uh just looking forward to what God has
[58:14] for us uh through the remainder of the
[58:16] services. But Zechariah 4 and verse one,
[58:20] and the angel that talked with me came
[58:23] again, and waked me as a man that is
[58:27] wakened out of his sleep, and said unto
[58:30] me, What seeest thou? And I said, I have
[58:34] looked, and behold, a candlestick all of
[58:38] gold, with a bowl upon the top of it,
[58:41] and his seven lamps thereon, and seven
[58:44] pipes to the seven lamps which are upon
[58:47] the top thereof, and two olive trees by
[58:51] it, one upon the right side of the bowl,
[58:54] and the other upon the left side
[58:57] thereof.
[58:58] So I answered and spake to the angel
[59:01] that talked with me, saying, "What are
[59:03] these, my Lord?" Then the angel that
[59:07] talked with me answered and said unto
[59:09] me, "Knowest thou not what these be?"
[59:13] And I said, "No, my Lord." Then he
[59:16] answered and spake unto me, saying, This
[59:19] is the word of the Lord under Zerubabel,
[59:22] saying, Not by might, nor by power, but
[59:26] by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Who art thou, oh great mountain, before
[59:33] Zerubable? Thou shalt become a plain and
[59:37] he shall bring forth the headstone
[59:39] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[59:43] grace unto it. Amen. Now Psalms 110 and
[59:47] verse three it says thy people shall be
[59:51] willing in the day of thy power in the
[59:55] beauties of holiness from the womb of
[59:58] the morning thou hast the dw of thy
[1:00:01] youth. Thy people shall be willing in
[1:00:05] the day of thy power. Now may God just
[1:00:09] add his blessings to the reading of the
[1:00:11] word. You can be seated.
[1:00:14] Brother Brandham
[1:00:16] read this portion of scripture here in
[1:00:19] Zechariah the 4th chapter
[1:00:22] while preaching a sermon uh titled the
[1:00:25] message of grace. And he would read
[1:00:28] verse six where it says the word of the
[1:00:31] Lord unto Zerubabel saying not by might
[1:00:34] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[1:00:37] Lord of hosts. And then he would say do
[1:00:40] you see the message will not come by
[1:00:43] some great might or powers but by the
[1:00:47] spirit of God. I believe that we are in
[1:00:51] a Holy Ghost move.
[1:00:53] uh you know the world is in an
[1:00:56] ecumenical move and uh the they're a
[1:01:00] part of a of a Jezebel system uh that
[1:01:05] the world is just under that kind of an
[1:01:08] influence and uh influencing them away
[1:01:11] from God even though they may go to
[1:01:14] church and be religious but we're more
[1:01:16] than just churchgoers. We're more than
[1:01:19] just religious. uh we're more than just
[1:01:22] uh saying that we are message believers,
[1:01:25] but uh but saying that we're a message
[1:01:28] believer has a meaning to it. And that
[1:01:31] means that that the full word has been
[1:01:34] restored and the bride tree has been
[1:01:37] restored and that the bride tree is in
[1:01:40] full bloom. And that is meaning that
[1:01:44] Jesus said, "I am the vine, you are the
[1:01:46] branch and without me you can do
[1:01:49] nothing." And so this is a Holy Ghost
[1:01:53] move. This is it takes the energy of the
[1:01:57] Holy Ghost moving into the church to
[1:02:00] bring forth fruit and to bring forth
[1:02:02] life. And brother Brandham would say it
[1:02:05] like this. We've heard it so many times.
[1:02:08] The move is on for the bride. That is
[1:02:10] thus saith the Lord. And so I believe
[1:02:13] that we are in the greatest move of God
[1:02:17] that the world has ever known. And it's
[1:02:20] this move that is going to take us into
[1:02:23] our body change. And it's manifesting
[1:02:25] the promises of God and making them a
[1:02:28] reality in our hearts and and lives.
[1:02:31] Brother uh uh it was Paul that would say
[1:02:34] that it's the spirit of grace. And I
[1:02:37] believe that it is the spirit of grace.
[1:02:40] It's the working of grace among us in
[1:02:43] this hour. Now the prophet would say
[1:02:46] that we know that this was during the
[1:02:49] time of the preparation of the
[1:02:51] restoration of the temple and Zerubabel
[1:02:54] was a great prince amongst the people
[1:02:57] who had laid the foundation of the
[1:03:00] building. And now he would say, I want
[1:03:02] you to put on your spiritual thinking
[1:03:04] anointing jacket this morning as we
[1:03:06] think. And this great prince had
[1:03:08] determined to rebuild the house of the
[1:03:10] Lord. And then when he did, he had laid
[1:03:13] the foundation stone. And it says, "Now
[1:03:16] Zerubabel has laid the foundation with
[1:03:19] his hands. He also shall bring forth the
[1:03:23] headstone." I want you to notice he
[1:03:25] never said he shall bring forth a
[1:03:27] cornerstone. He shall bring forth the
[1:03:29] headstone. And we know that the
[1:03:32] scripture says that Jesus is the chief
[1:03:34] cornerstone and he's also the headstone.
[1:03:38] Now if we will think for a few mo
[1:03:40] minutes that the seventh church
[1:03:42] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:03:45] the children back to the father. So
[1:03:47] immediately in reading this about
[1:03:50] Zerubabel, he is now going to take it to
[1:03:53] his own ministry and show that the
[1:03:56] seventh church messenger was to restore
[1:03:59] the faith of the children back to the
[1:04:02] fathers. In other words, rebuild the
[1:04:05] church again under the power of the
[1:04:08] spirit. Not by power, not by might, but
[1:04:12] by my spirit, saith the Lord. Not by
[1:04:14] organization, not by denomination, but
[1:04:17] by the Holy Spirit, God will bring forth
[1:04:20] the church in the last days. Now, the
[1:04:24] prophet of God that was in the message
[1:04:26] of grace. Then in the stature of a
[1:04:28] perfect man, he would say, "Christ never
[1:04:30] sent me to build organization.
[1:04:33] Christ sent me to build individuals to
[1:04:35] the stature of Jesus Christ that they
[1:04:38] might be the powerhouse and abiding
[1:04:41] place of the spirit by his word. Now the
[1:04:45] prophet of God would repeat that again
[1:04:47] and would say by his word build up the
[1:04:51] individual to that place not building an
[1:04:54] organization to a greater denomination
[1:04:56] but build the individual to sons and
[1:04:59] daughters of God. So we would see that
[1:05:02] it is the grace of God that has given us
[1:05:05] a message in the last days to restore us
[1:05:09] to the original faith and to build us up
[1:05:13] out of the word to powerhouses. I
[1:05:16] believe that that is what I'm looking
[1:05:18] at. I I'm not just looking at young men
[1:05:21] and and young ladies. And I'm not just
[1:05:23] looking at married couples throughout
[1:05:25] this building, but I'm looking at
[1:05:28] powerhouses that the message of the hour
[1:05:31] has built you to a place and a position
[1:05:34] in Christ to have perfect faith and
[1:05:37] perfect confidence in what God is doing
[1:05:40] in this age. And again, it's the working
[1:05:44] of grace in this hour. We have been
[1:05:47] restored back to a grace covenant. Amen.
[1:05:50] And that's why in Revelations 10, the
[1:05:53] prophet would identify who it was that
[1:05:56] was descending with an open book and he
[1:05:59] would say that is only Christ because
[1:06:02] it's the angel of the covenant. Amen.
[1:06:06] So, it's the covenant angel that has
[1:06:08] descended among us. And he's come with a
[1:06:12] promise. He's come with an open book.
[1:06:15] and your name is in that book and he is
[1:06:18] here to manifest everything that he
[1:06:21] promised for your life in this last
[1:06:24] days. And now so we are powerhouses of
[1:06:28] the spirit by his word. The prophet of
[1:06:32] God would go and he would talk about the
[1:06:35] pyramid and and how that the pyramid uh
[1:06:39] never had the capstone on it. And he
[1:06:42] would say, you know, he would take the
[1:06:43] American dollar and he would show you
[1:06:46] that the headstone was not even put on
[1:06:48] the pyramid. And then the prophet of God
[1:06:51] would show us how how perfectly uh tight
[1:06:56] that that that pyramid was built and the
[1:06:59] stones that weighed tons and and and how
[1:07:03] that they got them up in the air to to
[1:07:06] build them so perfectly on each other.
[1:07:08] And the prophet of God would say it had
[1:07:11] to be some kind of an atomic power that
[1:07:14] they had back there. And he would say
[1:07:16] now they had some kind of a tool that we
[1:07:19] don't have today that they could cut
[1:07:21] these stones so perfectly that it's it's
[1:07:25] a razor's edge. You you can't even the
[1:07:28] the that they so fit perfectly together.
[1:07:31] Amen. That it's a it's a razor's edge.
[1:07:35] Amen. Between them. The prophet of God
[1:07:37] would say, "So cut by the Holy Spirit,
[1:07:41] by God's great instrument and tool, that
[1:07:45] we'd be joined as one person."
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; My let that sink in. Amen. God's great
[1:07:52] tool, which is the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:07:56] Would cut us and we'd be joined as one
[1:07:58] person. We are not divided. We should be
[1:08:02] one person. And it goes to show that no
[1:08:05] machinery can do that that way. It takes
[1:08:10] God to do that. No mechanics of
[1:08:13] organization, no lodges, none of these
[1:08:16] none of these things can ever do it. As
[1:08:19] good as their intentions are, they can
[1:08:21] never do it because it takes God to do
[1:08:24] this. The Holy Spirit. Amen. So that is
[1:08:28] what God is doing by his great tool, the
[1:08:32] Holy Ghost, is he's cutting our lives.
[1:08:35] He's molding us. He's shaping us. He's
[1:08:38] he's getting our own ideas away from us.
[1:08:41] Amen. He's getting all the worldliness
[1:08:44] out of us. He's molding character in us.
[1:08:47] Amen. And and and it's not one group and
[1:08:50] one church against the other group and
[1:08:52] the other church. It's not one pastor's
[1:08:55] idea versus another pastor's idea. God
[1:08:59] has brought us all under the headship of
[1:09:03] the vindicated word of the hour, which
[1:09:06] is the Holy Ghost move, manifesting his
[1:09:09] word of promise in this age. And it's
[1:09:12] all uniting us as one person. You know
[1:09:16] what that means? It means that God has
[1:09:19] got a body upon this earth. Amen. It
[1:09:23] used to be the anointed man Christ
[1:09:25] Jesus. Now it is the anointed bride body
[1:09:30] that has so come in tune with the word
[1:09:33] and the Holy Ghost in this hour that is
[1:09:36] God manifesting his power in a many
[1:09:39] member bride body. Now you see amen. The
[1:09:43] prophet of God would say it like this.
[1:09:45] He would say that I believe that the
[1:09:48] church is now standing on the threshold
[1:09:51] of the greatest vindication of
[1:09:54] omnipotence that the world has ever
[1:09:56] known. Now that was in 56 in the
[1:09:58] junction of time. And he would show us
[1:10:01] that there is he says I I see that
[1:10:03] there's been seven great junctions in
[1:10:06] the history of the world. And then he
[1:10:08] would show us, amen, that at every
[1:10:11] junction when God is going to turn a
[1:10:14] corner or there's going to be a
[1:10:16] dispensation change, he would call it a
[1:10:19] junction. He would say, "Now that is
[1:10:21] when the power of omnipotence is made
[1:10:25] manifest." Amen. And it's to show the
[1:10:28] people that God is about to do
[1:10:31] something. Amen. And the prophet of God
[1:10:34] is letting us know, amen, that what we
[1:10:37] have seen in this hour is the greatest
[1:10:41] vindication of omnipotence. I I I just
[1:10:45] want to declare unto you. Amen. This is
[1:10:48] what we have seen. It is the power of
[1:10:51] almighty God that has been put on
[1:10:53] display in this age to get our attention
[1:10:57] and let us know that we have turned the
[1:11:00] corner. That there is a dispensation
[1:11:03] change. Amen. That the lamb of God has
[1:11:06] stepped into view and that we can see
[1:11:09] that it's God working among us. It's God
[1:11:13] healing the sick. It's God that's
[1:11:15] raising the dead. It's God that's
[1:11:17] breaking the shackles. It's God that's
[1:11:20] preparing us to believe for all things.
[1:11:23] Now, the prophet of God says, amen, that
[1:11:26] when omnipotence speaks, the miraculous
[1:11:29] takes place.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; So, he was letting us know, amen, that
[1:11:35] omnipotence is actually God. And he's
[1:11:38] speaking in this last days and it's the
[1:11:41] miraculous that is taking place. And the
[1:11:44] prophet of God would would show us that
[1:11:46] there was a leper and he was full of
[1:11:49] leprosy. And one day he come to
[1:11:52] omnipotence and he said, "Lord, if thou
[1:11:55] will will make me whole, if you can
[1:11:57] clean me, then you I know you can clean
[1:12:00] me." And God looks at him and Jesus
[1:12:03] looks at him and says, "I will be thou
[1:12:06] clean." And that was omnipotence that
[1:12:10] spoke. and the miraculous takes place.
[1:12:13] Amen. Now, we know that leprosy is a
[1:12:16] type of sin. Now, here is a person that
[1:12:19] he has no hope. There is absolutely
[1:12:23] nothing scientific that can help that
[1:12:25] man. His his his his
[1:12:29] members are going to just rot and and
[1:12:31] decay and and he's going to lose maybe
[1:12:34] fingers and maybe lose a hand and amen.
[1:12:37] He has no hope for his condition, but he
[1:12:41] recognizes that omnipotence is upon the
[1:12:44] earth. And when he comes and says, "I
[1:12:47] know you can clean me if you'll do it."
[1:12:50] And look at the voice of omnipotence,
[1:12:53] it's grace, friends, that said, "I will
[1:12:56] be clean." You see, when omnipotence
[1:13:00] speaks, the miraculous takes place. Now
[1:13:04] we know that that leprosy is a type of
[1:13:06] sin and sin is unbelief and the problem
[1:13:11] with so many conditions is unbelief. So
[1:13:15] God sent a message to separate us from
[1:13:18] unbelief and to fix the problem in the
[1:13:21] human heart and declare the problem is
[1:13:24] you got to believe the word. Hallelujah.
[1:13:28] Because there's a battle going on and
[1:13:30] the battle is not for your senses. The
[1:13:33] battle is not just for your memory or
[1:13:35] for your reasoning or for your
[1:13:37] conscience or your eyes. The battle is
[1:13:40] for your heart.
[1:13:42] And the prophet of God said, if we can
[1:13:44] get that certain thing fixed and get the
[1:13:47] and get faith on the heart, that'll take
[1:13:50] God's word and begin to speak that
[1:13:53] promise and confess that promise. I tell
[1:13:56] you, we can confess the promise over our
[1:13:58] homes. We can confess the promises over
[1:14:01] our children. It's because that there is
[1:14:05] omnipotence that is reigning over our
[1:14:08] lives. It's dealt with the problem and
[1:14:11] it's fixed it in this age and we've come
[1:14:14] to a perfect faith that God said it. I
[1:14:17] believe it. It settles it and we expect
[1:14:20] the miraculous.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] You see what he was doing? He was
[1:14:27] proving that there's a junction taking
[1:14:28] place in the days of Jesus. He healed
[1:14:31] the sick. He raised the dead. He he
[1:14:33] opened the eyes of the blind. What was
[1:14:36] it? Proving to the people that the
[1:14:39] junction was there. You see, they nailed
[1:14:41] him to the cross. And all the while they
[1:14:44] were in the temple singing their songs
[1:14:46] about the lamb of God that was going to
[1:14:48] come and going to take away the sins of
[1:14:50] the world. and they were doing their
[1:14:52] religious duties under the old
[1:14:54] dispensation. But the whole time there
[1:14:57] was the lamb and they didn't recognize
[1:15:00] that they had come to a junction and God
[1:15:04] had vindicated his power was upon the
[1:15:07] earth and they just continue right on
[1:15:09] going. Amen. But you see, God tore the
[1:15:13] veil. God from [screaming] the top uh
[1:15:16] from the top to the bottom toward the
[1:15:18] veil into the holiest of holies. Letting
[1:15:21] them know that God is doing this. Man
[1:15:24] didn't do it. God is doing this. And
[1:15:27] letting you know that we've turned the
[1:15:30] corner, [screaming]
[1:15:31] that omnipotence is among us, that the
[1:15:34] miraculous is taking place, that God is
[1:15:36] changing hearts. It's grace, friends.
[1:15:40] Well, if thou was in the cornerstone,
[1:15:43] what about the headstone? Because the
[1:15:45] headstone is Christ. And it's that same
[1:15:48] Christ, the anointed word that has come
[1:15:50] in full view of this age. And God again
[1:15:54] has tore the traditional veil that has
[1:15:56] been hiding Christ from our view. And
[1:15:59] let us know [screaming] the lamb of God
[1:16:01] is in plain view again. And it's for
[1:16:04] every mom, every daddy. It's for every
[1:16:08] home. If you can see him in the power of
[1:16:12] his resurrection, it's the answer.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; You see, there was another junction and
[1:16:21] that Abraham, he had just had his name
[1:16:25] changed from Abram to Abraham. He had
[1:16:28] been waiting for the promise for 24
[1:16:29] years. Well, we know the story and how
[1:16:33] that Abraham is a 99 year old man and
[1:16:36] Sarah's 89
[1:16:39] and and the prophet of God actually take
[1:16:41] us takes us in a little illustration and
[1:16:44] how that Abraham
[1:16:47] is just you know Sarah woke up on the
[1:16:51] bad bad mood wrong side of the bed that
[1:16:54] morning and and uh you know she was
[1:16:57] grumbling and complaining and talking
[1:17:00] about Sodom and talking about, you know,
[1:17:02] the latest fashions down in Sodom and
[1:17:05] talking about Mrs. Lot and why why why
[1:17:08] does she have it easy and I've got it
[1:17:10] hard and I'm over here in the back side
[1:17:11] of the desert and
[1:17:14] Amen. All because you made that choice
[1:17:17] and
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; and the whole time I I just want you to
[1:17:24] I I I want to bring a clarity. The whole
[1:17:27] time Sarah Sarah's name had been changed
[1:17:29] too.
[1:17:32] proving that Sarah was a part of this
[1:17:35] message. Also
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; remember what changed your name was
[1:17:39] under the seals. And he start and he
[1:17:41] said, "I'm not going to call you church
[1:17:42] any longer. I'm going to call you bride
[1:17:44] so you'll understand that who I'm
[1:17:47] talking about." And Abram, I'm not going
[1:17:50] to call you Abram any longer. I'm going
[1:17:52] to call you Abraham so you'll understand
[1:17:54] that you're a part of me and you've got
[1:17:56] a part of my name. and I'm going to
[1:17:58] place you positionally in the promise.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Now Sarah, in all of her unbelief and
[1:18:07] all of her questions and all of her
[1:18:09] complexes and all of her I I'm a failure
[1:18:13] and I don't know how I can manifest the
[1:18:15] promise and look at my condition and I I
[1:18:18] I I just can't do it and Sarah should
[1:18:21] have or Abraham should have got someone
[1:18:22] else. God should have got someone else.
[1:18:24] We've we've went through that ourselves.
[1:18:27] And there all the sudden, amen, Abraham
[1:18:31] just gets a gets away to himself and
[1:18:34] gets under a shade tree in the evening
[1:18:36] time and he begins to just ponder and
[1:18:38] meditate upon the promises of God. And
[1:18:41] all of a sudden, he sees three men
[1:18:43] walking down the road. And Abraham
[1:18:45] immediately recognizes who it is. And he
[1:18:48] jumps on his feet and he runs and he
[1:18:50] tells, "Hey, prepare a prepare some meal
[1:18:53] and prepare a calf and get things
[1:18:55] ready." And he runs out there to Amen.
[1:18:58] to to those three men and he says, "My
[1:19:01] Lord."
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, he had the correct
[1:19:05] identification. My Lord, not three,
[1:19:08] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but he
[1:19:10] recognized omnipotence.
[1:19:12] He recognized this is Elohim. Amen.
[1:19:15] There was some inspiration within his
[1:19:18] heart. He recognized God had been made
[1:19:21] flesh. And now it's God [screaming] with
[1:19:23] dust on his clothes walking, amen, to
[1:19:26] his tent.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And Abraham brings him in and says, "Let
[1:19:30] me get some water." And he washes their
[1:19:32] feet and and he begins to get the meal
[1:19:35] all ready, you know, and making
[1:19:37] preparations. And then all of a sudden,
[1:19:39] as the t as as as the story continues,
[1:19:42] we find that they're at a junction. This
[1:19:46] is when after 24 years of waiting for
[1:19:50] that promise and there they are in their
[1:19:52] old age. Amen. But there is Elohim. And
[1:19:56] the prophet of God says that was Elohim
[1:19:58] or that was the son of man. It was God
[1:20:02] that was made flesh. And he be to tell
[1:20:05] them I've come to visit you according to
[1:20:08] the time of life. And and there was
[1:20:10] Sarah in the tent behind him. And he
[1:20:13] begins to say, "Why, you know, uh uh I'm
[1:20:16] going to visit you." And Sarah begins to
[1:20:18] snick her up her sleeve a little bit and
[1:20:20] say, "Me, an old woman, have pleasure
[1:20:22] with my Lord, and how can I fulfill
[1:20:25] this?" And God, hallelujah, God at the
[1:20:30] junction performs the sign of the
[1:20:33] Messiah and discerns the thoughts and
[1:20:36] intents of Sarah's heart and says, "Why
[1:20:40] did Sarah laugh?" And Sarah comes out of
[1:20:42] that tent and says, "I didn't laugh."
[1:20:44] Said, "Oh, but you did laugh." Now, the
[1:20:46] prophet of God let us know that God
[1:20:48] would have killed her right there, but
[1:20:51] she was a part of Abraham.
[1:20:54] And he lets us know that God would have
[1:20:56] killed you and I because of our
[1:20:59] unbelief, but we're a part of
[1:21:01] [screaming] Christ.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; We're the ones that was in his mind
[1:21:05] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:21:07] we is dealing with us according to
[1:21:10] grace.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Now, no one could take place take
[1:21:15] Sarah's place. So God had to be made
[1:21:19] flesh to deal with her unbelief,
[1:21:23] her complexes, her fears, her questions.
[1:21:28] Are you with me?
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; You see what did that? It was the sign
[1:21:33] of the Messiah, the word that was
[1:21:36] dealing with her heart. And he never
[1:21:40] called her by her old name. He called
[1:21:42] her by her new name. showing us that
[1:21:46] even when we feel like we're unworthy
[1:21:50] and we feel like we can't manifest this
[1:21:53] message and we're sitting in a message
[1:21:55] pew and we're hearing the promises
[1:21:57] preached and we know amen that God has
[1:22:00] has vindicated his omnipotence among us
[1:22:03] and yet God is still dealing with us
[1:22:06] according to the spirit of grace. It's
[1:22:09] the moving of the Holy Ghost that is
[1:22:12] discerning our hearts, letting us know
[1:22:14] no one is going to take your place.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; No one. You see, it was a declaration of
[1:22:22] what time it is. The time is now and
[1:22:25] it's bride time. Hallelujah. You see,
[1:22:29] it's omnipotence. It's it's the word
[1:22:31] that is discerning the thoughts and
[1:22:33] intents of the heart. It is God coming
[1:22:37] with a with a two uh with his word that
[1:22:40] is sharper than a two-edged sword. And
[1:22:42] it's discerning. It's even dividing
[1:22:45] between soul and spirit. And the prophet
[1:22:47] of God says that's the gospel. The power
[1:22:51] of God. The word of God made manifest is
[1:22:54] the gospel. The gospel came to us not
[1:22:58] through word only but through power and
[1:23:00] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost to
[1:23:02] demonstrate the power and make the
[1:23:05] gospel live. Now again I said last night
[1:23:10] amen that we have been introduced to the
[1:23:13] Messiah and it's not a certain man that
[1:23:16] is here as the Messiah. It's the Holy
[1:23:19] Spirit is the Messiah. Christ and the
[1:23:21] Holy Spirit is the same thing. See, he's
[1:23:23] here now just working in the flesh,
[1:23:27] getting the body ready for the rapturing
[1:23:29] grace. Believe it, friends. And the
[1:23:32] prophet of God would show us it it it
[1:23:35] doesn't take something great. What it
[1:23:38] takes is just the simplicity of
[1:23:39] believing God
[1:23:42] to make his word speak out to show that
[1:23:46] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:23:49] today, and forever. It takes a humble
[1:23:52] heart dedicated to God to just to
[1:23:56] believe God to bring Jesus Christ unto a
[1:24:00] present tense. You see again, it's not
[1:24:03] by power, it's not by might. It's by my
[1:24:07] spirit saith God. I'll unfold this
[1:24:10] mystery and he will cry to it grace,
[1:24:13] grace with shoutings and cryings. That's
[1:24:17] what it is today. God's amazing grace to
[1:24:20] his people. How he takes the illiterate,
[1:24:23] the unlearned and shows that Jesus is
[1:24:27] the same. The Bible says that where the
[1:24:30] word of a king is, there is power. And
[1:24:34] who can say unto him, "What doest thou?"
[1:24:38] The prophet of God showed us that what
[1:24:40] we have today is the king's message. And
[1:24:44] then and then he would show us that he
[1:24:46] was in Sabino Canyon and and remember he
[1:24:49] had his hands up and and praying and all
[1:24:51] the sudden there was a king. There was a
[1:24:53] sword that struck his hand and and he's
[1:24:56] looking at that sword and and he said,
[1:24:58] "My eye is so beautiful and I've always
[1:25:00] been a little scared of a sword and and
[1:25:02] glad that I didn't live in those days."
[1:25:05] Amen. He's looking. He said, "You know,
[1:25:07] I I I know that a king has a sword." And
[1:25:11] all of the sudden a voice spoke back and
[1:25:13] said, "This is the king's sword and this
[1:25:17] is the third pull." Remember that. Amen.
[1:25:20] The third pull of the prophet's
[1:25:22] ministry. And then he would show us that
[1:25:24] the first two pulls was in preparation
[1:25:27] for the third pull. Amen. The the
[1:25:30] healing. Amen. And then the s the
[1:25:33] discernment h the the the sign that
[1:25:36] messianic sign discerning the heart was
[1:25:39] only in preparation for the word to
[1:25:42] come.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:46] And then we can see where that sword is.
[1:25:49] The sword is not in a sheath but the
[1:25:51] sword has been unshathed. And where is
[1:25:54] that sword at? It is in the mouth.
[1:25:59] The sword of God is the word of God that
[1:26:03] has been spoken this hour. And John was
[1:26:07] told in Revelation the 10th chapter,
[1:26:09] amen, the eth verse, you go to that
[1:26:11] angel and you take that book and you eat
[1:26:16] that book because you've got to prophesy
[1:26:19] again.
[1:26:21] I tell you, God has put a powerful word
[1:26:23] in our mouth. It's a word of prophecy.
[1:26:27] Amen. And we're not saying anything
[1:26:28] different than what a prophet has
[1:26:30] already said. We're saying it again.
[1:26:32] We're just saying it again. Speaking the
[1:26:35] word because where the word of a king
[1:26:37] is, there is power. And this is a sword
[1:26:42] that'll cut both going and coming. It's
[1:26:45] a sword that'll bring deliverance. It's
[1:26:48] a sword that'll heal. It's a sword
[1:26:51] that'll set the captives free. It's a
[1:26:53] sword of declaration of who is among us.
[1:26:57] It is the power of almighty God to deal
[1:27:00] with the people to let them know he
[1:27:03] still saves the lost. He still restores
[1:27:06] marriages. He still amen knows how to
[1:27:10] manifest his spirit of grace in every
[1:27:13] heart and every life and every boy or
[1:27:15] girl.
[1:27:20] You see, when it comes to this, this is
[1:27:21] so far beyond man.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; But this is up in the rim of the Lord's
[1:27:28] doing, [sighs] and it's marvelous in our
[1:27:31] sight. Let me just read Psalms 118 22-
[1:27:36] 24. The stone which the builders refused
[1:27:39] is become the headstone of the corner.
[1:27:42] This is the Lord's doing and it's
[1:27:45] marvelous in our eyes.
[1:27:47] This is the day which the Lord hath
[1:27:49] made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; You see, we will see it. This is the
[1:27:57] Lord's doing. And it is marvelous in our
[1:28:00] eyes. And Jesus said, "The world won't
[1:28:03] see me, but you'll see me. Because I
[1:28:06] live, you're going to live also. The
[1:28:09] world won't see me." The world, the
[1:28:11] cosmos, the world order, they're just
[1:28:13] continuing right on. And the world is
[1:28:15] falling apart. And it's getting worse
[1:28:18] and worse and worse. But here we are
[1:28:21] with a declaration that this is the
[1:28:23] Lord's doing. This message is the
[1:28:26] ministry of Zerubable that has turned
[1:28:28] our hearts to the headstone and is
[1:28:30] crying grace, grace. It's the presence
[1:28:33] of omnipotence. It is Christ the word
[1:28:37] coming among us.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; We see it. Our hearts are burning within
[1:28:42] us. We know it's our answer. Hallelujah.
[1:28:47] You see, it's the vindication. It's God
[1:28:50] manifesting his presence among us. And
[1:28:53] the Bible says that this is the day
[1:28:55] which the Lord hath made. Hallelujah.
[1:28:58] Let me just say it like this. in that in
[1:28:59] a day of gross darkness, in a day of
[1:29:03] gloom, in a day of weary, nervous
[1:29:07] tension, where the world is falling
[1:29:10] apart, governments don't have an answer,
[1:29:13] politicians are fighting and feuding,
[1:29:15] and no one's got an answer. Everything
[1:29:17] is in corruption. The world is getting
[1:29:20] worse and worse and worse. But here we
[1:29:22] are. This is the Lord's doing. God has
[1:29:26] made this day. He's made it for the
[1:29:28] weary. He's made it for the tired. Come
[1:29:31] into this Holy Ghost move. It'll comfort
[1:29:34] your heart. It'll give you rest. It'll
[1:29:37] give you a faith for the rapture.
[1:29:41] This is the Lord's doing. This is the
[1:29:43] Lord. This is the day the Lord hath
[1:29:45] made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[1:29:51] That word rejoice, it means to spin
[1:29:54] around
[1:29:56] under the influence of any violent
[1:29:58] emotion.
[1:30:00] To be glad, to be joyful, to rejoice. I
[1:30:05] just want to say this day that the Lord
[1:30:06] hath made his omnipotence has been
[1:30:08] declared among us and vindicated. It has
[1:30:10] brought forth a violent motion.
[1:30:14] It sets you free. It sets you free from
[1:30:17] darkness. It set you free from fear. It
[1:30:20] set you free from discouragement. It set
[1:30:23] you free from hopelessness. It has
[1:30:26] turned you around violently and give you
[1:30:29] a joy.
[1:30:31] [cheering]
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; A joy because you see it
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; because you know it's a deep calling to
[1:30:38] the deep and it's the answer to the
[1:30:41] thirst of your soul.
[1:30:45] Then it says be glad in it. That means
[1:30:49] to brighten up.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; It means to be gleome,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; cheer up.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; To make glad. That's what he did. He
[1:30:59] made us glad.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that the human
[1:31:03] heart was made to be happy.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. To turn the frown into a smile.
[1:31:10] Amen. to look at the situations of the
[1:31:12] trials that you're going through, but
[1:31:14] look at it gladly with a joy in your
[1:31:17] heart because you know all things work
[1:31:20] together for good to them who love God.
[1:31:22] And God's molding a character. He's
[1:31:25] molding a character that will reign with
[1:31:27] him in the millennium.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And God is doing something great in your
[1:31:34] life in this age.
[1:31:38] God knows what he's doing.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; God remembers the promise. He's the one
[1:31:43] that decreed this day. I will visit you
[1:31:46] according to the time of life.
[1:31:50] Sarah, it's time to get out of that bad
[1:31:53] mood.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; It's time to have an understanding. Get
[1:31:58] out of that complex. Get out of that
[1:32:00] fear. Get away from that weary. That
[1:32:03] weary will give you cancer. That weary
[1:32:06] will destroy a home. But come back to
[1:32:09] the word of omnipotence and realize that
[1:32:12] God has made you a miracle in this day.
[1:32:16] We would have been like Sodom if not for
[1:32:19] God.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Remember Sodom? Remember they were burnt
[1:32:25] up. Don't you remember Leosa? They've
[1:32:29] kicked Christ out of the age. They don't
[1:32:31] want his omnipotence and they're going
[1:32:33] to burn up. But before the burning, God
[1:32:36] comes down and vindicates his presence.
[1:32:39] Amen. To give you a faith for the change
[1:32:41] of your body.
[1:32:44] To let you see that there is no accident
[1:32:46] in God. But God has brought you out of
[1:32:48] law, denominational ages to bring you
[1:32:51] into the age of grace. So you can cry
[1:32:55] grace, grace to the headstone.
[1:32:59] Grace, grace to this message. Grace,
[1:33:02] grace to the living presence of him.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:33:11] the bride of Christ has been awakened
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; by a message to a realization and
[1:33:18] understanding of who you are
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; and who is here.
[1:33:23] [sighs]
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And all the saints have longed to see
[1:33:27] what you see.
[1:33:29] Moses longed for this day. Remember, God
[1:33:32] made this day for you
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; because we're in a dispensation of
[1:33:36] overcoming.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; You've got to have something to overcome
[1:33:40] by. And this is also the dispensation of
[1:33:43] adoption.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Dispensation of adoption, dispensation
[1:33:49] of overcoming. Are you finding the
[1:33:51] connection? The land's yours. The
[1:33:53] position is yours. The inheritance is
[1:33:56] yours. Caleb, go take it.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Where's the thorn? Get it out of the
[1:34:04] sheath.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Quit just allowing the message of the
[1:34:07] hour just to collect dust. It's time to
[1:34:09] confess it. It's time to speak it. It's
[1:34:12] time to realize what age you're living
[1:34:14] in. It's time to realize that all heaven
[1:34:17] is backing you up.
[1:34:20] [cheering] You say, "Well, I'm scared.
[1:34:22] Scared to speak the message. What if
[1:34:25] I'll get out of order? What what if I'll
[1:34:27] say the wrong thing? The prophet of God
[1:34:29] says that he has sent God sent the
[1:34:32] message to know to let us know the house
[1:34:34] and winds and everything about it.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; So how can you go wrong
[1:34:40] taking the message of the hour
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; and destroying the devil with it?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You tell me. Mas, why would you be
[1:34:51] fearful to speak this message?
[1:34:54] That is why we be we be fearful to leave
[1:34:57] this message in a sheath when it's
[1:34:59] supposed to be in our mouth and we
[1:35:01] supposed to be confessing it, speaking
[1:35:04] it, standing upon it. God's vindicated
[1:35:08] this message and he didn't leave us just
[1:35:12] because William Brandham went away. He's
[1:35:14] still here. [screaming]
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; If he if he backed it up once, he'll
[1:35:20] back it up twice. If he backed it up
[1:35:22] twice, he'll back it up 20 times.
[1:35:25] [applause]
[1:35:26] He still heals. He still saves. He still
[1:35:29] redeems. He still This is still the year
[1:35:33] of Jubilee. [cheering]
[1:35:37] What does that Jubilee mean for me? The
[1:35:40] captives can go back to their homes and
[1:35:43] take up residence where the squatter
[1:35:46] tried to say, "It's my land."
[1:35:49] The devil's a squatter, young people.
[1:35:52] The devil's saying the Holy Ghost ain't
[1:35:54] for you. He's a squatter.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; The devil's saying that you can't live
[1:35:58] this promise. I just want to let you
[1:35:59] know who you are. You're a Joshua
[1:36:01] generation that is fed up with just
[1:36:04] religion, fed up with just hearing
[1:36:07] quotes, but a Joshua generation that is
[1:36:10] stepping into the promised land and
[1:36:12] saying, "Where is that devil? For me in
[1:36:15] my house, we are overcomers. I'm coming
[1:36:18] into my adoption. I'm coming in to what
[1:36:21] God ordained for me. [cheering]
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I know the devil's trying to say it's
[1:36:27] for a future generation. Well, it's not
[1:36:29] for you now. It's for the future. Let me
[1:36:30] just tell you, you're not the church of
[1:36:32] tomorrow. You're the church of today.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; You say you don't know what you're
[1:36:37] talking about. I gave my heart and
[1:36:38] filled with the Holy Ghost at 12 years
[1:36:40] old. I know exactly what I'm talking
[1:36:42] about. I seen God answer my prayers when
[1:36:44] I was 12 years old, 13 years old, 14
[1:36:46] years old. I know it's for this
[1:36:48] generation.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; I know it's for now.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; My wife would share her testimony. She
[1:36:56] was a young girl that was raised on a
[1:36:58] message pew,
[1:37:00] [panting]
[1:37:01] but there was no life in her church.
[1:37:04] They didn't believe in the power of God.
[1:37:06] And worldliness started creeping into
[1:37:08] her life and all kinds of things trying
[1:37:10] to pull her into the world. Church
[1:37:12] fusses, church feuds, all kinds of
[1:37:15] different ideas. in the church. Oh my.
[1:37:18] But one day, a 16-year-old young lady,
[1:37:22] she come to church and begin to listen
[1:37:24] to a preacher by the name of Wayne
[1:37:25] Lawson. And that young girl at 16 years
[1:37:28] old repented of her sins and God filled
[1:37:31] her with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:33] Don't you tell me I don't know what I'm
[1:37:34] talking about. Don't you tell me that
[1:37:37] the day has passed me by. This is the
[1:37:39] day that God created. This is God's
[1:37:41] visitation of grace. It's for you. It's
[1:37:44] for the weary. It's for the weak. is for
[1:37:46] the oppressed. It's for those that the
[1:37:48] devil has said is not for you. Come back
[1:37:51] to the promised land, the message of the
[1:37:53] hour, and see omnipotence in action.
[1:37:57] [applause]
[1:37:59] See if God won't fill you with the Holy
[1:38:01] Ghost.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; See if God won't give you a refreshing
[1:38:04] of his presence.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; See if omnipotence is not here in 2025.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Something has awakened us.
[1:38:16] Now I you forgive me but I'm I'm trying
[1:38:19] to let you know about this grace that is
[1:38:22] among us.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Something has awakened us to something
[1:38:26] so supernatural
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; that is so far beyond your humanity.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; It's awakened us to something that is
[1:38:34] unearly.
[1:38:36] It it it's not earthly. It's it's it's
[1:38:39] something that is beyond our human
[1:38:41] efforts. Now I'm talking about grace.
[1:38:44] I'm talking about what this message has
[1:38:46] introduced us to awakened us. I mean, a
[1:38:49] hand that has come down and shook us and
[1:38:52] said, "You got to see what hour you're
[1:38:53] living in. You got to you got to know
[1:38:55] the day in your message."
[1:38:58] And he began to take us to the opening
[1:39:00] of the word and show us whose presence
[1:39:03] we are in.
[1:39:05] And when the world is getting worse and
[1:39:08] yet we've got something that is
[1:39:10] arresting our hearts
[1:39:13] that is making us stronger.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; It's something so beyond
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; laws
[1:39:22] and controls
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; and regulations
[1:39:26] and dos and don'ts and governments.
[1:39:32] It is something more than just something
[1:39:34] that dictates human efforts.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; It's something more than what we can
[1:39:39] imagine. It's something more than what
[1:39:41] we can see. It's something more than our
[1:39:43] memory.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; It's something that that when the devil
[1:39:48] is hounding your memory and saying, "I
[1:39:50] know what you did and trying to bring up
[1:39:52] all the scars of the past."
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to say that we have been
[1:39:55] awakened to something that is greater
[1:39:57] than your memory.
[1:40:01] is something that is h that is that is
[1:40:03] superhuman.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; It's supernatural.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; It's so far above our human intelligence
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; that the human mind can't even fathom
[1:40:15] what has taken place in this age.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about faith and grace.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You see something that we've been caught
[1:40:24] up into the realm of the Lord's
[1:40:26] thinking.
[1:40:28] You see, I I just read an article of how
[1:40:31] that some years back
[1:40:33] just they took AI. This we're talking
[1:40:36] about, I believe about seven or eight
[1:40:38] years ago. Think of what they can do
[1:40:40] now.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; But there was a man who had a motorcycle
[1:40:43] wreck and he become a quadriplegic and
[1:40:46] he had something wrong with his spinal
[1:40:48] cord and he couldn't walk. He couldn't
[1:40:49] move for a decade. Couldn't move. But
[1:40:53] science begin to tinker and begin to
[1:40:56] take AI and find out that you can take
[1:41:00] plates and you can put it on the human
[1:41:02] skull
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; and where where that the nerves have
[1:41:06] been severed that it couldn't receive
[1:41:08] signal from the brain down to the rest
[1:41:11] of the body.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Put on your spiritual thinking caps now
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; that you couldn't move, you couldn't
[1:41:18] [screaming] walk, you you couldn't
[1:41:20] function. Yeah.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to refer I want to now put it
[1:41:24] back to a son of God
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; that something has severed us from
[1:41:28] headship.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Something has severed us from the
[1:41:31] control tower that we couldn't walk in
[1:41:33] the power of God. We couldn't move in
[1:41:35] the power of God. We couldn't speak in
[1:41:37] the power of God.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; We were under denomination manmade
[1:41:42] creeds and dogmas and we can never
[1:41:44] manifest the power of God.
[1:41:47] But all the sudden, just like they're
[1:41:49] finding out in science that AI, they
[1:41:51] could take these plates and they could
[1:41:53] bypass the bruise,
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; they could bypass the hurt.
[1:42:01] [cheering]
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; It was a wreck that put that hurt in his
[1:42:04] life.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And we've been in church wrecks.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; We've been in human failures.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; And we couldn't get beyond our hurts. We
[1:42:14] couldn't get beyond our humanity. But
[1:42:17] God [screaming] supernaturally
[1:42:19] said, "I'm going to bypass that hurt.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with that memory.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with that cancer."
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; When they did that, they put those
[1:42:33] plates. They bypassed the Amen. They
[1:42:35] bypassed that hurt
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; and now that man can walk.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what science has
[1:42:41] done. And the prophet of God says, "I'm
[1:42:44] afraid that science will find God.
[1:42:45] Tinkering in God's laboratory will find
[1:42:47] God before the preacher does."
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to say that this
[1:42:51] message has come to heal the hurt,
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; to fix the hurts. Hurts that man has put
[1:42:58] there, hurts that we ourselves have
[1:43:00] wrecked up, just wrecks everywhere. But
[1:43:03] [screaming] God says, "I'm going to fix
[1:43:06] the hurts."
[1:43:10] The prophet of God says, "We have been
[1:43:12] lifted up into the realm of the Lord's
[1:43:14] thinking."
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Your human mind, you can't fix anything.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Your human mind remembers everything of
[1:43:20] your past. Your human mind remembers,
[1:43:23] Amen. all of the bitter words and all of
[1:43:26] the bitter disputes and amen false,
[1:43:29] Amen. false ideals of this message that
[1:43:31] has crippled you.
[1:43:33] I know I'm preaching to you,
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; but God in 2025 says, "I'm going to
[1:43:39] remind my people that omnipotence is
[1:43:42] here, and I'm going to bypass the hurt,
[1:43:45] and they're going to be justified as if
[1:43:47] it never happened in the first place.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to heal the bruised. I'm going
[1:43:54] to mend the brokenhearted. And I'm going
[1:43:56] to put them on their feet again. And
[1:43:58] they're going to begin to walk in the
[1:43:59] power of Almighty God. and I'm going to
[1:44:02] be able to look at a life and say,
[1:44:03] "There goes my spirit flowing freely."
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet of God says in
[1:44:09] the message of adoption. He says he's
[1:44:11] wanting to put his sons in their
[1:44:13] position that he can say, "There goes my
[1:44:15] spirit flowing freely. No [screaming]
[1:44:18] blockages in the body, no blown fuses in
[1:44:22] the body, just a body that says, I
[1:44:24] believe it. I believe it's for me. I
[1:44:26] believe I am placed here to manifest the
[1:44:29] promised word of the hour.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; But you got to have faith in grace.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; You got to see that you're a part of
[1:44:39] this promise.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "We're now
[1:44:44] sitting in his presence in heavenly
[1:44:46] places, being lifted up by the word. The
[1:44:49] word never come to beat you up. The word
[1:44:51] came to lift you up."
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; You see, there's been a blending of
[1:44:56] dimensions.
[1:44:58] Amen. The prophet of God says that the
[1:45:00] lid of hell has been opened up and all
[1:45:03] hell 200,000,000 demons have been turned
[1:45:06] loose in this age. Blending of
[1:45:08] dimensions. [gasps] But he says when all
[1:45:11] hell has been emptied out, all heaven
[1:45:12] has come down.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God would let us know
[1:45:16] that when you feel like you're going to
[1:45:18] shout and something begins to just just
[1:45:20] just comes upon your nerves, upon your
[1:45:22] senses, and you just want to say
[1:45:24] hallelujah, he says what's happening is
[1:45:26] a angel just brushed into you.
[1:45:29] I didn't say it. A prophet let us in on
[1:45:32] the others the on in on the unseen realm
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; and let us know that there's ministering
[1:45:38] spirits, angels sent from the presence
[1:45:39] of God to minister to the heirs of
[1:45:42] salvation to let you know healing's for
[1:45:44] you. Deliverance is for you. The rapture
[1:45:47] is for you. Joy is for you. Peace of
[1:45:50] mind is for [screaming] you.
[1:45:54] something that's radically turning your
[1:45:56] heart around to praise and worship and
[1:45:59] you're offering the sacrifices of praise
[1:46:01] under the almighty God.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; because something is arresting your
[1:46:11] heart, fixing the heart and then giving
[1:46:14] you a faith that says it's by grace and
[1:46:17] grace alone.
[1:46:20] You see a blending of dimensions
[1:46:23] that you can see that almighty God has
[1:46:25] moved among us and vindicated his
[1:46:28] presence like no other time in the
[1:46:30] history of the world
[1:46:32] to empower you and I to believe that God
[1:46:36] is here to manifest every promise
[1:46:38] concerning you and I.
[1:46:40] Do you believe that
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; he has come down to empower a bride?
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; That every promise concerning you and I,
[1:46:50] he's here to make it good.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; You see, he's come into your flesh. Can
[1:46:58] you say amen to that?
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; It's the son of man coming into the
[1:47:04] flesh of the bride
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; to anoint you. And this is an this
[1:47:10] anointing is the spirit of grace. And
[1:47:12] it's so far beyond your upups, so far
[1:47:16] beyond your humanity, so far beyond your
[1:47:18] past, so far beyond your book of
[1:47:21] remembrance that the prophet of God says
[1:47:24] that there has been an invisible union
[1:47:26] and your old book has been thrown into
[1:47:28] the sea of forgetfulness. God doesn't
[1:47:31] even remember it.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; You're not big enough. You [screaming]
[1:47:36] remember. And the devil is the accuser
[1:47:38] of the brethren. But what you've got to
[1:47:40] see is God is so big that he forgets you
[1:47:45] ever did sin.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; So every time the devil comes to you and
[1:47:52] says, "I know what you did." You just
[1:47:54] remind him it's in the sea of
[1:47:55] forgetfulness. God don't remember it and
[1:47:58] I don't even want to hear about it.
[1:48:03] Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; It's grace
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; because God's got something great for
[1:48:07] this bride.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; And the only way you're going to take
[1:48:10] take a body change is have a perfect
[1:48:12] faith in grace.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:48:18] see, he's come to change how we think,
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; how we view ourselves.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; The devil's telling you you're unholy.
[1:48:27] The devil's telling you you're no good.
[1:48:29] The devil's bringing up your old past,
[1:48:31] that book of remembrance. But God has
[1:48:34] come in this hour to change how you
[1:48:36] think about yourself.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; He's come to change how you're viewing
[1:48:41] your families and the situations that
[1:48:44] you're going through. Just like we heard
[1:48:46] this morning that there is Amen. Billy
[1:48:49] Paul, he's Amen. What what was it? 14
[1:48:51] years old, I believe, and he's got
[1:48:52] smoking a cigarette. And the prophet of
[1:48:54] God didn't blow up. The prophet of God
[1:48:56] didn't say, "I'm not even worthy to be a
[1:48:59] prophet." And no,
[1:49:01] something changes the way we view life.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Got a 17-year-old girl playing that
[1:49:10] booglyw music that the prophet of God
[1:49:12] preached against and despised it and
[1:49:14] hated it with a passion and yet could
[1:49:16] stand there and say, "Be a friend to
[1:49:18] her. Love her." Cuz he knew the secret
[1:49:20] to victory.
[1:49:24] This message came not to just be quotes.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; This message came not to just say, "I've
[1:49:29] got the message of the hour." This
[1:49:31] message came as omnipotence. To have
[1:49:33] preeminence over your life, to have
[1:49:36] preeminence over your thinking, to have
[1:49:38] preeminence over your emotions, to have
[1:49:40] preeminence of how you even look at your
[1:49:42] failures.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you if news flash,
[1:49:46] you're going to be a human all the way
[1:49:49] to the body change. And the prophet says
[1:49:52] you're going to make mistakes. But the
[1:49:54] way that you live an overcoming life is
[1:49:56] you feed your soul [screaming]
[1:49:58] with the word.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; When that old nature tries to revive,
[1:50:03] that old black dog tries to revive, you
[1:50:06] got to die out to that thing daily. Put
[1:50:09] it under the blood daily. Put it under
[1:50:11] submission under your feet. Come on,
[1:50:14] bride of Jesus Christ. Come on,
[1:50:16] [screaming] mighty warriors. in the last
[1:50:18] day. Put that old thing under your feet
[1:50:20] and say, "Greater is he that is in me
[1:50:22] than he that is in the world. I despise
[1:50:25] my own nature. I despise my human
[1:50:28] senses. I live [screaming] by the word.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; What does he say about me?"
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Little boy goes, he's a country boy.
[1:50:44] Never seen a mirror before. Never seen
[1:50:45] himself in the mirror. But he goes and
[1:50:47] visits grandma in the city and he looks,
[1:50:50] he's just a little boy looking around,
[1:50:52] maybe trying to get into a little bit, I
[1:50:53] don't know, a little bit of
[1:50:54] mischievousness,
[1:50:56] trying to find something to do. And all
[1:50:59] of a sudden, there was a door that had
[1:51:01] been closed before. Now it's open.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; And there is something that he had not
[1:51:07] seen before.
[1:51:09] [panting and gasps]
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; And he sees another little boy there.
[1:51:14] and he raises a hand to wave at that
[1:51:16] little boy and that little boy waves
[1:51:17] back.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; He takes a step toward that little boy
[1:51:21] and that little boy takes a step toward
[1:51:24] him. It's a mystery.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; He don't know what it's about. But as he
[1:51:28] gets closer to it, the shadow is
[1:51:30] becoming a positive.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Until
[1:51:36] he gets nose tonse, face to face, and
[1:51:39] the reality strikes his heart, that's
[1:51:41] me.
[1:51:43] Hallelujah. Mom and grandmother was
[1:51:46] watching what was going to take place.
[1:51:47] What took place was a realization of his
[1:51:50] identity. He turned to said, "Mama,
[1:51:52] that's me."
[1:51:54] Let me just say what a vindicated word
[1:51:56] has decreed over your life. [screaming]
[1:51:58] That's me.
[1:52:00] I'm an overcomer. I am invincible. The
[1:52:03] devil is defeated. The devil is under my
[1:52:06] feet. I am healed. I am rapture
[1:52:09] material.
[1:52:10] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:52:13] is in the world. [cheering]
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a faith. It's a faith
[1:52:18] that has birthed in our heart and is
[1:52:20] growing into a perfect manifestation of
[1:52:22] a son and daughter of God. That
[1:52:24] everything that Adam lost in the garden
[1:52:26] has been restored. And we've got the
[1:52:27] abstract to the title deed. The abstract
[1:52:30] has went all [screaming] the way back
[1:52:32] search the lean and is decreed they've
[1:52:35] there is nothing to hold you.
[1:52:36] [screaming]
[1:52:37] There is nothing that can put you under
[1:52:39] bondage. There is no devil in hell that
[1:52:43] can try to say that's my possession
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; because the blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:52:49] blown has broke the shackles of hell off
[1:52:53] of your life. You never did it in the
[1:52:56] first place.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Now everything that Adam had in the
[1:53:02] Garden of Eden that was lost in the fall
[1:53:04] has been restored.
[1:53:06] But my question to you is, can you
[1:53:08] believe it?
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Can you believe in this grace that has
[1:53:12] put the book in your hand and then said,
[1:53:14] "Now put your faith into action."
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost, receive the
[1:53:19] Holy Ghost.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [gasps]
[1:53:22] Got a situation that's impossible, that
[1:53:24] believe for the impossible.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Why cry, little bride? Speak and go for
[1:53:31] it.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; We've moved into a faith walk
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; every day of your life. Monday to Sunday
[1:53:41] and repeat all over again. It's a faith
[1:53:43] walk.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Walking in the promises of God.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As I believe I was said I
[1:53:50] said it last night that the rapture is
[1:53:52] just going to be a common everyday
[1:53:54] occurrence.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; But you're feeding upon the promises of
[1:53:58] God and the devil's trying to talk you
[1:54:00] out of it. And the devil's saying it's
[1:54:03] not for you. And you're saying it's for
[1:54:05] you. The devil's saying you're no good.
[1:54:08] But you're taking the blood and saying
[1:54:09] that I am I am his righteousness. I am
[1:54:13] his holiness. He has died for me once
[1:54:16] and for all. He has dealt with the sin
[1:54:18] question. I am as perfect as he is
[1:54:20] perfect because I am made perfect by one
[1:54:22] sacrifice.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; And I have been washed by the blood of
[1:54:27] the lamb. And that word washed means
[1:54:29] loosed.
[1:54:32] loosed
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; and you're walking and you're fighting.
[1:54:40] You're not in a picnic.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; You're in a battle.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; And the faster you realize that, the
[1:54:48] better you'll be
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; to realize that you're not here to have
[1:54:54] it easy.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; You're here to cut up some devils.
[1:54:59] You are here to prove to the devil that
[1:55:01] you are not like Eve who hybrid the word
[1:55:05] by just doubting one promise that Jesus
[1:55:08] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:55:10] forever. I'm quoting now. She got hung
[1:55:12] up on one promise that Jesus Christ is
[1:55:15] Hebrews 13:8. Well, I just want to
[1:55:18] declare unto the devil that this bride
[1:55:20] knows [screaming] that the same Jesus
[1:55:22] that was in Moses, the same Jesus that
[1:55:24] was made flesh, the same Jesus that
[1:55:27] appeared to Paul through the pillar of
[1:55:28] fire is the same Jesus that had his
[1:55:31] picture taken with the prophet. And it's
[1:55:33] the same Jesus that is abiding in my
[1:55:36] flesh.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. News flash. I believe
[1:55:43] [screaming] in grace.
[1:55:45] I believe that I've been made for this
[1:55:47] day.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; I believe there's no weapon in hell that
[1:55:51] can defeat me.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; I [screaming] believe in the power of
[1:55:56] omnipotence that is raining upon the
[1:55:59] throne of my heart [screaming]
[1:56:00] that says I believe the word. I believe
[1:56:04] it's for me. And you whack that devil.
[1:56:07] And if he doesn't move, whack him again.
[1:56:09] He doesn't move, whack him again. And
[1:56:11] whack him until he moves. [screaming]
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; takes rugged faith,
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; but this faith comes from a grace that
[1:56:21] knows it's your day
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; and it's your hour and it's the season
[1:56:26] for it and all the backing of heaven is
[1:56:30] yours.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; This came to let us know that it's time
[1:56:37] to believe in the supernatural.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; It's time. The time has come to believe
[1:56:45] for the body change,
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; to believe for the rapture.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; And the body change is as easy as
[1:56:52] walking in the promises of God.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; You see, we're a promised land people.
[1:56:56] Do I have enough a little bit more time?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; We're a promised land people
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; and grace has prepared us to walk in the
[1:57:06] supernatural.
[1:57:07] And just as Joshua and Caleb came out of
[1:57:09] that promised land just drunk on the new
[1:57:12] wine, [laughter]
[1:57:14] they had so much fruit, so much evidence
[1:57:18] that everything that Moses said it was,
[1:57:20] it really is.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; They came back testifying
[1:57:25] why it's a good land and it's flowing
[1:57:27] with milk and honey.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Why you've never tasted pomegranates
[1:57:31] like this in your life. They're car and
[1:57:33] you know what they're doing? They're
[1:57:35] carrying the evidence back to the
[1:57:37] people.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; They've got some healing
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; and they're coming to a young man and
[1:57:42] says, "Here, here you're sick. Here's
[1:57:44] some evidence."
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Goes to someone out that
[1:57:49] that's having a hard time and they're
[1:57:51] struggling and they're all weary and
[1:57:53] bowed over in the cares of life and
[1:57:54] they've got some evidence and said,
[1:57:55] "Here's some joy for you.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Take that joy." And all of the sudden
[1:58:01] something just begins to bubble up in
[1:58:02] the soul. It's because they're feeding
[1:58:04] on the evidence of the promise.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; You see, you know what the ministry is
[1:58:10] to do is to take the omni is to take the
[1:58:13] vindicated presence of omnipotence and
[1:58:16] bring it into the lives of the people
[1:58:18] and say, "Here's the evidence. Heaven is
[1:58:20] real. Angels are real. Jesus is real.
[1:58:23] It's finished. It's the finished work of
[1:58:25] Calvary. You can profess anything in
[1:58:28] [screaming] the word. It's yours.
[1:58:32] Quit your struggling. Just set your
[1:58:34] wings of faith and fly in the promises
[1:58:37] of God.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the age I believe we're
[1:58:43] in. The season that we move beyond the
[1:58:46] critical spirits.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Now, Brother Jonathan, I know
[1:58:51] what I see. I know what I hear. I'm not
[1:58:54] looking at it.
[1:58:58] I told you we're in a special season and
[1:59:02] this is a season of grace. I believe
[1:59:04] 2025 I believe that this message is so
[1:59:07] real and so moving of the power in this
[1:59:10] Joshua generation that I believe that we
[1:59:13] are not looking at the critics. We're
[1:59:15] not looking at scoffers. We're not
[1:59:17] looking amen at all the naysayers. I
[1:59:20] believe that we realize that this is our
[1:59:22] season. This is our time, amen, to go
[1:59:25] possess Hebrin. This is the time for the
[1:59:28] body change. This is the time for the
[1:59:29] resurrection of the dead. This is the
[1:59:31] time where every promise of God is yay
[1:59:33] and amen. And we have heard the absolute
[1:59:36] of the word. Proclaim omnipotence is
[1:59:38] here to make good your faith.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; I believe it's for you. I believe it's
[1:59:44] the season we're in. I believe that God
[1:59:46] made this day for this for this season.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; The time of saying, "I wish I could and
[1:59:53] I hope I could and one day I will and
[1:59:56] it's over.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Our view's been changed. There's an
[2:00:02] anointing upon our life. God's doing the
[2:00:04] work. God is manifesting his promise
[2:00:07] because we are a promised land people."
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan, how do I do it? You
[2:00:12] just walk into it as your inheritance.
[2:00:19] If I've got $20 right here
[2:00:23] and I said this is your inheritance.
[2:00:26] [laughter]
[2:00:30] [applause]
[2:00:31] [cheering]
[2:00:35] [applause]
[2:00:42] Now there is an example there too
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; because the prophet of God says you got
[2:00:48] to be spontaneous
[2:00:51] [applause and cheering]
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; and when this word comes to you you got
[2:00:53] to get moved
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; and the time for action is now
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; well praise the name of the Lord.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; You move into it as your inheritance.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; You're still not moving.
[2:01:13] He was running.
[2:01:15] [applause]
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; The move is on for the bride. [cheering]
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; People have been pondering that. Oh, we
[2:01:22] don't need a Holy Ghost move. We don't
[2:01:24] need emotions. We don't need shouting.
[2:01:26] Let me tell you something. The Holy
[2:01:27] Ghost anoints our senses.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; But that's not even what I'm talking
[2:01:31] about. I believe in shouting. I believe
[2:01:33] in dancing. I believe in speaking in
[2:01:34] tongues. I believe in the gifts. I
[2:01:36] believe that the prophet of God put
[2:01:37] everything in perfect order. And I
[2:01:39] believe everything in our promised land
[2:01:41] is ours and it's yay and amen. It is
[2:01:43] proper order. But let me tell you what
[2:01:45] this Holy Ghost move is all about. It is
[2:01:47] the Holy Ghost anointing our faith to
[2:01:50] get into action and take a hold of the
[2:01:52] promises of God and say, "It's mine.
[2:01:55] It's mine. It's mine." To quit
[2:01:58] hesitating, to quit wondering, to quit
[2:02:01] questioning, to quit reasoning, to quit
[2:02:03] wondering. Is it really for me? Can I do
[2:02:05] it? The Holy Ghost is anointing this
[2:02:08] bride to get a hold of the promises of
[2:02:11] God and say, "This is my evidence.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; I'm feasting upon the good things of
[2:02:18] God."
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Well, it's the truth anyhow.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; It's a good land.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; It's flowing with milk and honey. It's
[2:02:28] the benefits of Calvary. It's the Holy
[2:02:31] Ghost. The blood has already been in the
[2:02:33] ground. The chemistry of the blood went
[2:02:35] into the ground 2,000 years ago. But
[2:02:38] what was in the [screaming] blood was
[2:02:39] the bloodshell,
[2:02:41] the life.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; And when the blood shell broke,
[2:02:44] [screaming] the move was on for the
[2:02:47] believer.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost be to bring evidence.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; The denomination said, "Well, you can't
[2:02:57] believe for that. God don't perform
[2:03:00] miracles." Amen. The prophet of God came
[2:03:02] around and said, "We can't how are we
[2:03:04] going to have faith for a rapture when
[2:03:05] we can't even have faith for divine
[2:03:07] healing,
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; faith for a headache, hardly." But how
[2:03:11] did he deal with that kind of a faith?
[2:03:12] He began to deal with that law, that
[2:03:16] spirit of denominationalism that was on
[2:03:18] the people that said they didn't have a
[2:03:19] right to believe in those things.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; He was liberating you to not only
[2:03:26] believe for a healing, but to believe
[2:03:29] for the greatest healing there is.
[2:03:31] That's the change of our bodies.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Where did that come from?
[2:03:37] God sent a prophet.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; And he began to back that message to let
[2:03:44] you know that this is not just a man,
[2:03:47] but this is a ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:03:50] in the last days to introduce us to the
[2:03:53] headstone.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; And that is the very power of God coming
[2:03:58] down to make every promise manifest in
[2:04:03] this bride body.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; What was it doing? It was releasing the
[2:04:09] very things that Satan through all of
[2:04:11] those denominational creeds and dogmas
[2:04:14] had bound up the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; But a prophet came with a let me just
[2:04:19] say it like this. He came with a
[2:04:20] sledgehammer or we can just say he took
[2:04:22] a sword and he been be to whack away and
[2:04:26] chop a bride loose and break down those
[2:04:28] traditional barriers. And then the Holy
[2:04:31] Ghost begin to flow.
[2:04:35] What was the Holy Ghost flowing? The
[2:04:37] evidence of Calvary
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; that healing still here, deliverance is
[2:04:42] still here. Joy is still here.
[2:04:43] Restoration is still here. Amen.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Liberating the people to believe for all
[2:04:51] things
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; to realize that while we were yet
[2:04:55] sinners, Christ died for the ungodly.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; To realize that for our sakes, the wrath
[2:05:04] of God was poured up poured out upon
[2:05:06] Jesus Christ. The wrath that should have
[2:05:09] taken you out, instead it was poured out
[2:05:12] upon Jesus Christ, our perfect sacrifice
[2:05:16] that you could be free.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he who knew no sin became
[2:05:23] sin for us.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he bore our shame.
[2:05:30] The prophet of God would say it like
[2:05:32] this that he paid the debt of your high
[2:05:34] breeding
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; in order that you could die to yourself
[2:05:40] until you're no more yourself and be
[2:05:42] filled with his word believing his word
[2:05:44] and then the Holy Spirit was in him
[2:05:46] comes down to water that word to make it
[2:05:49] grow. The prophet of God would say and
[2:05:51] Jesus the word took my place. He become
[2:05:55] me that a sinner that I might become him
[2:05:58] the word. Let me hold true to it not the
[2:06:02] church. The Bible says that we have a
[2:06:05] high priest
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; that was in all points tempted like as
[2:06:11] we are yet without sin.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Tempted
[2:06:19] with everything that you're going
[2:06:21] through.
[2:06:23] Can you give me just five more minutes?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Every struggle,
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; every question,
[2:06:31] every temptation, every complex, all
[2:06:34] your fears, all your worries,
[2:06:39] that little hesitation, is he really
[2:06:41] talking to me?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Like like our little sister, the money's
[2:06:46] there, the inheritance there,
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; but can I really step out and take it?
[2:06:52] What if it's really not for me? I I'll
[2:06:54] be embarrassed.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says he was
[2:07:01] tempted in every like way.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're feeling.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; He knows your insecurities. He already
[2:07:10] felt it.
[2:07:12] He suffered everything. And the wrath of
[2:07:14] God came down upon him and broke his
[2:07:18] body.
[2:07:20] They took the cat of nine tails and they
[2:07:22] beat his back until his bones were
[2:07:26] showing.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; They mocked him. They plucked his beard
[2:07:30] out, ripped it out of his face. They
[2:07:32] spit in his face. Roman spit. Slime just
[2:07:36] coming off of his face.
[2:07:39] And he did it for you. Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; And then God in his mercy,
[2:07:48] when the devil thought that he had this
[2:07:49] little bride bound up,
[2:07:52] but God had already spoke a word and
[2:07:54] said, "I'm going to restore her
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; and she's going to be word of my word.
[2:07:58] She's going to be flesh of my flesh.
[2:08:00] She's going to be spirit of my spirit.
[2:08:02] She's going to be everything that I am
[2:08:05] made flesh."
[2:08:08] And when God came down to make that
[2:08:11] covenant real to you and I,
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; the covenant angel, and he began to show
[2:08:17] you the promises of God and that they're
[2:08:19] just as good as the very day that he
[2:08:20] spoke them
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; and that there is nothing there is
[2:08:24] nothing against you.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; You didn't get saved certain day.
[2:08:31] You always were saved.
[2:08:34] Amen.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; And God sent a word to bring you to an
[2:08:39] understanding of who you are in Christ
[2:08:41] before the foundation of the world.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Why? The prophet of God said, we say
[2:08:47] we've got eternal day. You eternal life.
[2:08:49] You don't get get eternal life on a
[2:08:50] certain day. You are a part of him for
[2:08:54] all eternity.
[2:08:56] But you've only been made manifing
[2:08:59] time to express his attributes that you
[2:09:02] are the light of the world.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Then you've then you've got to step out
[2:09:10] and be spontaneous and say that's me.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; He died for this purpose.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; The word took my place that I can take
[2:09:18] his place.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; He become my sin. And he he took my he
[2:09:24] took he become unworthy. He became
[2:09:26] unholy. All of these things. He did it
[2:09:28] for me. Young people. He knows your
[2:09:30] passions.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; He knows your insecurities.
[2:09:34] He knows what it is to be pulled by the
[2:09:36] world. He knows what it is in Leosa. He
[2:09:40] felt the pressures.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Why? We heard how that is 10 times
[2:09:47] harder than a hundred times harder. and
[2:09:48] that how how you're facing things that
[2:09:51] maybe mom and dad don't understand. But
[2:09:52] I'm here to tell you, you've got a
[2:09:54] merciful high priest that knows exactly
[2:09:56] what you're going through.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't understand it." Let me
[2:10:02] just say some things you just can't
[2:10:04] comprehend. You've got to believe what
[2:10:06] the Bible says. He was tempted in all
[2:10:09] points
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; and yet without sin because it was God
[2:10:15] that broke a bloodshell in the womb of a
[2:10:17] virgin to manifest a perfect sacrifice
[2:10:21] to take her place. It's grace.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; And in this age when [screaming] John
[2:10:28] wept there was a message that said don't
[2:10:31] weep John for the light of the tribe of
[2:10:33] Judah prevailed. And he turned around to
[2:10:35] Zeion and he saw a lamb
[2:10:39] and a lamb that had been bloody and had
[2:10:42] prevailed
[2:10:44] because he was fighting over you.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; And he knew in the last days that the
[2:10:50] only way that you're going to overcome
[2:10:51] in this evening time is grace.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; The only way that you're going to become
[2:10:56] perfect in this age is grace.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; And it's not going to be sinless
[2:11:01] perfection in your own works. It's going
[2:11:03] to just simply be a perfect faith and a
[2:11:05] perfect blood.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; And as you believe in that blood, it's
[2:11:09] just lifting you higher and higher and
[2:11:12] higher. And it's molding you and it's
[2:11:14] shaping you and it's cutting a
[2:11:16] Christlike character in your life.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:24] for one purpose
[2:11:27] that we can come boldly
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; without hesitation, without fear,
[2:11:32] without dread, without complexes.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Just come boldly into the presence of
[2:11:38] our merciful high priest.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Why are you coming? Because there's a
[2:11:43] need in your life.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Come boldly before the
[2:11:49] throne of grace."
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Well, who's on that throne of grace?
[2:11:52] It's omnipotence.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; It's Elohim. It's almighty God that has
[2:11:56] been revealed to us in this human
[2:11:58] element in this last days
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; that we can come into his divine
[2:12:02] presence, his word, and say, "Lord
[2:12:05] Jesus, I'm struggling.
[2:12:08] I'm battling with some situations. Got a
[2:12:11] nervous spirit that's trying to take my
[2:12:13] joy. It's it's giving me anxiety. It's
[2:12:16] taking my peace away from me.
[2:12:19] I've got situations in my marriage that
[2:12:22] misunderstanding and it's breaking my
[2:12:23] home apart.
[2:12:26] You see, you're not meant to carry that
[2:12:27] burden.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; We're trying to be our own high priest.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; But it's our high priest that is our
[2:12:35] burden bearer. He's already carried your
[2:12:38] burdens.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; They're nailed at the [screaming] cross.
[2:12:41] And he becomes the offy to go into the
[2:12:44] hell. And then he went to hell to take
[2:12:46] the keys of death head on the grave. And
[2:12:49] he rose up victorious on the third day.
[2:12:51] He did it for your justification
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; so you can believe.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Come boldly
[2:13:00] and say, "God, I believe it's for me."
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "The problem of
[2:13:06] it is we've got so much fear and scare.
[2:13:08] Let the musicians come.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; We've got so much fear and scare." He
[2:13:12] says, "Now
[2:13:14] He says, "I'm I'm going to deal with
[2:13:16] that."
[2:13:18] He says, "You don't know who you are.
[2:13:23] You're not going to be a son of God. You
[2:13:26] already are a son of God.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; You didn't become seed at the altar.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; You're only hearing the shepherd's call
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; and you're responding."
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; And it's because you always worship.
[2:13:41] Yes,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; it's because you always were his
[2:13:45] possession.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; I I I tell you, we're in a season
[2:13:52] I I believe that there is I there's just
[2:13:55] such a season of grace upon us
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; that there was such a deep calling into
[2:14:02] the deep
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; that we're tired of just remembering
[2:14:06] evidences
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; 65 years ago.
[2:14:12] We're tired of just looking at an
[2:14:14] inheritance and wondering if it's ours.
[2:14:16] And can we step out in faith and possess
[2:14:18] it? And maybe God just made us this way.
[2:14:21] Maybe he wants us to be this way. No.
[2:14:23] No. He wants you to be overcomers.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; And he's done everything in his power to
[2:14:29] give you a faith that his grace is here.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; It's grace.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Grace to the headstone.
[2:14:41] He's here to minister to your heart, to
[2:14:44] minister to your life.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; He's here to make you white as snow.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; He's here to take the limits off.
[2:14:57] The prophet of God says that if you can
[2:14:59] just if you can just get past the sound
[2:15:03] barrier,
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; he said we got to remove beyond that
[2:15:09] traditional barrier.
[2:15:12] He says, "If that plane could just break
[2:15:16] break free from its own sound barrier,
[2:15:21] then he says what we need to do is break
[2:15:23] free of our own sound barrier." You know
[2:15:26] what that that is? It's a reason.
[2:15:30] You know, the greatest tool that the
[2:15:31] devil's got is reason.
[2:15:34] Questioning, wondering, is it really for
[2:15:37] me? Can I really do it? a fear.
[2:15:42] But I I just want to say that I believe
[2:15:47] and you forgive me for being so bold,
[2:15:49] but I believe that there is such a
[2:15:50] special anointing of grace upon this
[2:15:54] bride in this season
[2:15:58] that if you can break free of your own
[2:16:01] sound barrier, well, I know what this
[2:16:03] one said and I know what this is
[2:16:05] happening and I know what's happening
[2:16:07] over here and that person there and that
[2:16:09] person
[2:16:11] Let's just break free of the sound
[2:16:12] barrier, our own sound barrier, and
[2:16:16] break past
[2:16:19] that old reasoning.
[2:16:22] I just say that if you need the Holy
[2:16:24] Ghost, this is your service.
[2:16:28] How many would agree with me?
[2:16:32] How many would agree from the front to
[2:16:34] the very back to even outside this
[2:16:36] building that if someone would want the
[2:16:38] Holy Ghost, this is their service?
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; If someone is bound, I don't care the
[2:16:48] past. I don't care for how long.
[2:16:51] I really don't. I declare unto you there
[2:16:54] is a freedom in Christ Jesus
[2:16:57] and he's here.
[2:17:00] If we can recognize he's real and
[2:17:02] recognize that he's among us,
[2:17:06] why it's unlimited what God can do.
[2:17:12] Maybe you've got marriage situations,
[2:17:16] why it it looks like the devil's doing
[2:17:19] everything in his power to make it lead
[2:17:21] to a divorce. But I just want you to
[2:17:24] know that omnipotence is [music] here. I
[2:17:26] can't fix you. Your pastor can't fix
[2:17:29] you.
[2:17:31] But the word is a discerner of the
[2:17:34] thoughts and intents of the heart. And
[2:17:36] he knows how to fix the problem.
[2:17:39] I'll tell you what we need
[2:17:43] more than all of the counseling sessions
[2:17:45] there is in the world. I'll tell you
[2:17:48] what we need is a real Holy Ghost move.
[2:17:51] If mamas and daddies could just get into
[2:17:54] divine presence, situations will be
[2:17:57] healed. situations will be fixed. There
[2:18:00] will be humility take place. There will
[2:18:02] be apologies made.
[2:18:06] I was just over in another in another
[2:18:09] country and never been to the place
[2:18:11] before and it was very [music]
[2:18:13] spontaneous
[2:18:15] when I was invited there and I
[2:18:20] I I had just a little a little opening,
[2:18:22] a little slot to go and we made it
[2:18:25] happen. And as I was preaching that
[2:18:27] first service,
[2:18:30] a man came up and we prayed for him. And
[2:18:35] his testimony
[2:18:37] was I had made up my mind that this was
[2:18:40] my last service.
[2:18:42] I'd already thought it through. I'd
[2:18:44] already determined I was quitting God. I
[2:18:46] was quitting church. I wasn't coming
[2:18:48] back. I was going in the world.
[2:18:50] There had been situations that was that
[2:18:53] was in his life. But as he come and he
[2:18:56] began to hear the word, God had be to
[2:18:59] deal with his heart. And he come and he
[2:19:02] rededicated his life to Jesus Christ.
[2:19:04] And he went to his wife and made things
[2:19:06] right. And situations [music]
[2:19:08] that seemed impossible made him right.
[2:19:11] It was all because of the working of
[2:19:13] grace.
[2:19:16] Maybe you've come in this camp thinking
[2:19:19] that things are impossible. And and
[2:19:22] maybe they are. Let's just be quite
[2:19:24] honest.
[2:19:26] Maybe they are impossible.
[2:19:29] But with God, all things are possible.
[2:19:32] And if you can believe all things are
[2:19:34] possible with you as [music] well.
[2:19:37] I'm I'm just The pastor said, Brother
[2:19:39] Ben said that I can take my full liberty
[2:19:41] and if we want to have a a prayer call,
[2:19:44] an altar call or whatever, I do as I I
[2:19:48] feel led. I'm just going to I'm just
[2:19:50] going to say this. If you've got a
[2:19:51] situation in your life
[2:19:54] and you would like like us to agree with
[2:19:57] you, I'm going to invite you to come.
[2:20:02] Why put it off for another day?
[2:20:05] Why put it off for another situation?
[2:20:07] The prophet of God said, "The greatest
[2:20:10] the greatest debt
[2:20:14] is looking at the glare of another day.
[2:20:20] looking at the past [music] and only
[2:20:22] hoping that God could do it for you
[2:20:24] today. Why don't we just go ahead and
[2:20:27] say he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:20:30] forever. And what he did last camp,
[2:20:33] he'll do again today.
[2:20:35] What he did for you 20 years ago,
[2:20:37] elders, he'll refill you again today.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. He fixed your marriage
[2:20:45] before. He'll do it again.
[2:20:51] He met you at your point of grace, at
[2:20:53] your point of need. It was grace that
[2:20:55] fixed you maybe five years ago or 10
[2:20:57] years ago. He'll do it again. Is there
[2:21:00] anything hard for the for the Lord?
[2:21:03] So, as we're singing,
[2:21:06] why don't why don't you just come?
[2:21:10] If you need the Holy Ghost, why don't
[2:21:12] you just surrender your life and say,
[2:21:14] "God, fill me.
[2:21:16] I need you, Lord.
[2:21:19] Go ahead, brother.

[2:21:57] and believe that the grace of God is

[2:47:19] turned our hearts from doom and gloom,
[2:47:23] fear, reasoning, thinking that it's not

[2:47:59] believe that we should give him a
[2:48:00] sacrifice of praise.
[2:48:03] I believe that we should thank him.
[2:48:06] Glorify him. Say, "Thank you for my
[2:48:09] family. Thank you for this jubilee.
[2:48:12] Thank you that it's great grace.
[2:48:15] Hallelujah.
