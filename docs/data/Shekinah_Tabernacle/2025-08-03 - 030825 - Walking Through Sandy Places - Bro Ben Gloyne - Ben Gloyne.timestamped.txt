[34:50] will lift up my hands in thy name. My
[34:52] soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
[34:54] and fatness, and my mouth shall praise
[34:56] thee with joyful lips. When I when I
[34:59] remember thee upon my bed, and meditate
[35:01] on thee in the night watches, because
[35:03] thou hast been my help, therefore, in
[35:05] the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So, let's just
[35:10] approach the Lord in prayer this
[35:11] morning. We have one prayer request.
[35:13] Omar Robin has pneumonia, so we want to
[35:15] pray for her. If you have a need, just
[35:16] want to slip your hand up, say, "Lord,
[35:17] remember me at this time." Amen. Let's
[35:19] pray. Almighty God, we're so thankful,
[35:21] Lord. We can rejoice under the shadow of
[35:23] your wings. Glory to your name. Father,
[35:26] we've read your great eternal word. Now,
[35:28] we're asking you who gave the word to
[35:30] come anoint it, Lord, to our hearts,
[35:31] dear God. May you take control of the
[35:33] service. We, Lord, just want to so so
[35:36] thankful, Lord. We can rejoice in you,
[35:37] saying it's not I, but Christ in us,
[35:40] Lord, the hope of glory. Dear God, I
[35:42] just want to lift up Omar Robin into
[35:43] your presence by prayer. See this
[35:45] pneumonia, Lord has gripped her, Lord. I
[35:47] pray, Father, your healing hand would be
[35:49] upon her, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[35:51] When you stood in Pilot's judgment hall
[35:52] that day, you took those stripes, Lord.
[35:54] You had this sickness on your mind, dear
[35:56] God. You purchased her healing in full.
[35:58] So, I pray you'd fully restore her back
[36:00] to perfect health for your glory, Lord.
[36:02] And Father, any other need in our midst,
[36:03] Lord Jesus, touch every life, Father,
[36:05] both here and those who are watching by
[36:07] the stream, be their portion as well,
[36:08] dear God. We love you, Lord. We thank
[36:10] you for this opportunity to gather,
[36:12] Lord, as a people. So, Father, may cover
[36:14] us in your blood and have your way in
[36:16] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can
[36:20] have your seats this morning. Amen. So,
[36:22] I want to talk about walking walking
[36:25] through this world and especially
[36:27] walking through uh dry places or or or
[36:31] sandy places. So we have here David
[36:34] would you know David is as we read here
[36:36] in Psalm 63 he longed to see the glory
[36:39] of the Lord as he had seen it in the
[36:41] sanctuary. So here was David as as as it
[36:44] said in the uh in the beginning of that
[36:45] psalm he was in the wilderness of Judah.
[36:47] He had uh he was he was now on the run
[36:50] from from Saul and his life had you know
[36:52] his life had become very complex and we
[36:55] live in a very complex age. It's not a
[36:57] simple age. It's a very complex age.
[36:59] There's so many things going on, so many
[37:01] voices, so many, you know, things are
[37:03] happening in this age. It's a complex
[37:05] age. Life never used to be like this.
[37:07] But you see, David, David used to have a
[37:09] simple life before before Samuel was
[37:12] sent to his house to anoint him. You
[37:14] know, he was just raising his father's
[37:16] sheep and, you know, he was just part of
[37:17] the family. But, but God had other plans
[37:19] for David because God wanted David to
[37:22] experience him in everyday life. not
[37:25] just not just see his power in the
[37:26] sanctuary where he go to church or
[37:28] however it was in those day but he
[37:29] wanted God wanted to prove himself to
[37:31] David in every part of his life and and
[37:34] so David remembered seeing his power and
[37:36] glory and he and he was hungry he was
[37:38] thirsty he was you know you know he was
[37:39] in this dry and barren land in this
[37:41] wilderness but he he had a desire God I
[37:43] want to see you and the reason that
[37:45] David was led out there in the
[37:47] wilderness was God was going to show him
[37:49] amen so there's many things that we walk
[37:50] through in life that are you know our
[37:52] paths you know we this This is a
[37:54] straight and narrow road we walk on,
[37:56] right? But it's not a smooth road all
[37:58] the time. Amen. It can be a very
[38:00] challenging road. It can be a difficult
[38:02] road. It can be a very swampy or muddy
[38:04] or however you want to say it road of it
[38:06] can be a very sandy road. Amen. Man's
[38:08] man's ideas fly in and fly out and you
[38:11] got to tread over those things. But the
[38:13] thing is, God wants to prove himself in
[38:15] those times. You know, he wants to prove
[38:16] himself in every situation of life.
[38:19] Amen. Because he wants to prove he's not
[38:20] just God in church or at camp or some
[38:23] special meetings. No, he's God
[38:24] everywhere. Amen. And he said, "I'll
[38:26] never leave thee, nor forsake thee." So,
[38:28] David was led out. See, it wasn't
[38:30] David's fault. He was on the run. He had
[38:32] not caused this at all. Really, what had
[38:34] caused it is that that a vindicated
[38:36] prophet of God was sent to his house to
[38:38] anoint him. Amen. And the anointing that
[38:40] came upon him, Amen, was to bring out
[38:42] the fact that he was a king. So, so
[38:44] David wasn't looking to be anointed. He
[38:46] wasn't looking to become king. Same
[38:47] thing you and I. We weren't looking to
[38:49] be the bride of Jesus Christ. We weren't
[38:51] even looking to become Christians. Amen.
[38:52] No. But God was looking for you. Amen.
[38:55] Like Samuel was sent to Jesse's house
[38:56] because God was looking for David. Amen.
[38:58] So this anointed word has come looking
[39:00] for you. Amen. It's anointed you. Amen.
[39:02] Transformed your life. Amen. Sins
[39:04] beneath you. Amen. He's filled you with
[39:05] his transforming power. He's changed
[39:07] you. What you were, you're not. Amen.
[39:09] God has done a great work. Amen. So now
[39:11] we're going to realize that we weren't
[39:13] looking for this.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for God as a drunk
[39:16] university student, but God was sure
[39:18] looking for me. Amen. And who he goes
[39:20] searching for, he finds. Amen. He gets a
[39:22] hold of, he keeps. Amen. He lifts them
[39:24] up on his strong shoulders, takes them
[39:26] into their sheepfold, into his
[39:27] sheepfold, and they're safe and secure
[39:29] forever more. Amen. No matter what they
[39:31] have to go through. Amen. But you see,
[39:33] the reason that he was on the run wasn't
[39:36] wasn't David's fault. It was as a result
[39:38] of what Saul had done.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Saul because of compromising to try and
[39:42] keep the people together, Amen. caused
[39:45] the anointing to come off him and it
[39:47] went upon David.
[39:49] Amen.
[39:50] So now here he was in this spot. He was
[39:52] in this dry and thirsty land. Now see if
[39:56] I can drive this here. Now we live in a
[40:00] we live in a a
[40:03] complex age. Now I want to go here as
[40:05] well. Well, let's just read this. So
[40:07] David was very perseverant. He got he he
[40:09] took right out after Goliath, right? And
[40:11] after that same slingshot won the
[40:13] victory. Why? He believed in what he was
[40:14] trying to achieve. His achievement was
[40:16] right. It was in the will of God, in the
[40:18] word of God, and the plan of God. And if
[40:20] you can find out that your what your
[40:22] place is in the plan of God, even though
[40:24] you may be sick and nearly dead, you
[40:25] say, "I'm a Christian. How could that be
[40:27] in the plan of God?" It might be in
[40:29] God's plan to heal you and give you a
[40:30] testimony that will shake souls to the
[40:32] kingdom of God. Certainly, he lets those
[40:34] things happen. Maybe you had your ups
[40:36] and downs and the enemy scorching you
[40:38] from side to side. It might be that way.
[40:40] It's all in the plan of God. Amen. So,
[40:42] our walk that God's ordained is all in
[40:45] his plan. Amen. It's not always a simple
[40:48] we just want a, you know, cupidity
[40:50] expressway kind of experience. It's
[40:52] flat. We can go. It's straight. It's
[40:54] easy. There's no corners. But God's path
[40:57] for us isn't that way. There's ups and
[40:59] downs. There's bri patches. But isn't it
[41:01] amazing? Many times we get into a
[41:03] difficult place. And we begin to
[41:04] question our experience with God. But
[41:06] the reason we've got into those
[41:08] difficult experiences is because we have
[41:10] an experience with God. I mean, God has
[41:12] confidence in you. Not your humanity,
[41:14] but that seed he put on you. He has
[41:16] confidence that his salvation will hold.
[41:18] It will keep. It will prove what it is.
[41:20] Amen. That's why he allows you to go
[41:22] through difficult places. Amen. It's
[41:25] like Abraham. He went through a lot of
[41:26] spots. But God wanted to prove to
[41:28] Abraham who he really was. And he could
[41:30] never show Abraham who he was sitting in
[41:32] the ches living with his family doing
[41:34] all the comfortable things. No, his walk
[41:36] had to get into difficult places. had to
[41:39] get in places where there was tension at
[41:41] home and tension with, you know, among
[41:42] his extended family and all the with
[41:44] Lot, all these things. God brought him
[41:46] that way.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[41:48] &gt;&gt; was it Abraham doing anything wrong? No.
[41:50] So, why do we question ourselves when we
[41:52] get into difficult places? What have I
[41:54] done wrong, Lord?
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Actually, no. You're doing everything
[41:57] right. You're walking in the path God
[41:59] has ordained you to walk. Amen. I mean,
[42:01] because the footsteps of the righteous
[42:03] are ordered of the Lord. They can be
[42:05] difficult steps. I'm probably going to
[42:06] repeat this all the way through, but
[42:07] that doesn't mean God is displeased. It
[42:09] doesn't mean you're not a believer.
[42:10] Doesn't mean you're not part of him. No,
[42:13] that's the reason
[42:14] &gt;&gt; God wants to prove his word. Who's he
[42:16] going to do it through? You and I. How's
[42:18] he going to do it? He's going to take us
[42:19] through difficult things and we'll come
[42:21] out triumphantly out the other end. Why?
[42:23] Because he is our strength and our
[42:25] redeemer.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like, you know, it's amazing
[42:28] how many times people get sick. And I
[42:31] don't know any balanced Christian that
[42:32] gets sick and they think, "Am I really a
[42:34] Christian? They think, "No, it's just
[42:36] the devil and it's sickness and but
[42:38] God's more than able." But then why
[42:39] don't we hold that same testimony when
[42:41] it comes into a mind battle?
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Why do we why don't we hold that? You
[42:44] know, because it's amazing how the enemy
[42:46] comes into our mind and makes us
[42:47] question and troubles and all these
[42:49] things. Then we start doubting our
[42:50] salvation.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Why is that?
[42:52] &gt;&gt; No, a a believer is a believer.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're under attack physically
[42:57] or spiritually, it's still the enemy,
[42:59] right? It doesn't mean you're not saved.
[43:01] Doesn't mean you're not victorious. It's
[43:03] just the enemy having a go at you. So
[43:05] why don't you have a go at him?
[43:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, take the word of God, stand in
[43:09] your God-given rights, and keep walking.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; But you see, what happens is many times,
[43:18] well, actually, all the time, when
[43:20] trouble comes, we begin to forget what
[43:24] he said. Now, I'm going to weave this in
[43:26] with this story. I'm going to try and
[43:28] tie these two accounts together, but you
[43:30] know, Luke would Luke would give the
[43:32] account of the two on the way to Emmas.
[43:33] Now, I love the story because brother
[43:35] Bram said this is prophecy that there's
[43:37] that there's believers in the days of
[43:39] the of the resurrection that God is
[43:42] going to walk with. He's going to open
[43:44] his word too and they're going to see
[43:45] him like what he did before he died. And
[43:48] that's you and I. There's a fulfillment
[43:49] of this prophecy is you and I, right?
[43:51] And so here they are. They're the living
[43:52] in the greatest week of history. the
[43:55] death, burial, resurrection of our Lord
[43:56] Jesus Christ. They're living in the
[43:58] greatest event. All the prophets long to
[43:59] see it. The angels wanted to look into
[44:01] it, but and here they were living in it,
[44:03] and the world had fallen apart. See, now
[44:05] they were walking through difficult
[44:06] ground. It was easy to walk with the
[44:09] Messiah when everything was going well.
[44:11] Lazarus came out of the grave. Oh,
[44:12] that's a nice path to walk in. Amen. The
[44:14] storms calmed on the sea. That's a great
[44:16] path to walk in. You know, uh Das's
[44:18] daughter comes from the dead. That's a
[44:20] great path to walk in. But when there's
[44:22] questions and when there's you know you
[44:23] don't have all the answers, you begin to
[44:25] wonder what happens is as sand of man's
[44:27] opinion begins to blow in and ideas of
[44:29] man and you know walking on sand can be
[44:32] difficult.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the sand that's
[44:34] right by the water. That's hard. I'm
[44:36] talking about the you know the like the
[44:37] dunes and stuff. It's hard to slog. You
[44:39] got to you can't just you you got to see
[44:41] where you're looking and watch and all
[44:42] these things. And they were they were
[44:44] walking down this kind of a path and
[44:46] they begin to talk together about all
[44:47] the things which had happened. And it
[44:49] came to pass that while they communed
[44:51] together in reason, Jesus himself drew
[44:54] near and went with them, but they did
[44:56] not know. Their eyes were beholden. They
[44:58] didn't realize who he was. And then he
[45:00] began to ask them a question. What
[45:01] manner of communications are these? Like
[45:03] why are you talking this way? What is
[45:05] going on? Now he was the one who caused
[45:07] it all walking with them saying, why are
[45:09] you talking like this? And then and then
[45:12] one of them, you know, Clopus was so so
[45:15] you know, I just imagine the look on his
[45:16] face. Hey, why you what do you mean? Why
[45:20] are you asking this question? Have you
[45:21] not been in Jerusalem? Have you not Have
[45:23] Weren't you there 3 days ago? Didn't you
[45:26] see what happened
[45:39] causes us to forget what he said?
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be of good courage. I've overcome
[45:44] the world. I'll never leave thee nor
[45:46] forsake thee. Amen. All things work
[45:48] together for good. Those that love God
[45:50] are called according to his purpose.
[45:51] Those kind of things kind of we kind of
[45:53] when disappointment comes up, we forget
[45:55] what he said. Amen. And it isn't just
[45:57] like that like we have it today. When
[45:59] one little disappointment comes up about
[46:01] something, someone comes in and misconr
[46:04] misconstr something and then we go to
[46:06] say, "Oh, well, it's all fanaticism.
[46:08] Maybe there's nothing to it after all.
[46:09] Isn't that just a human race? Isn't that
[46:12] just a human race? Well, I know the
[46:14] divine healing isn't real cuz I know
[46:15] Mrs. Jones has prayed for and she didn't
[46:17] get well. That doesn't have one thing to
[46:19] do with God's promise. That has to do
[46:21] with Mrs. Mrs. Jones faith or the will
[46:23] of God. See now, but they had forgotten
[46:26] all of his words and that what he said
[46:29] he would raise on the third day. And
[46:31] they were present when he said it. And
[46:32] when he talked to his disciples, but
[46:34] they had forgot all about it. Sorrow had
[46:36] come. They've seen a man that had raised
[46:38] the dead after being dead for 4 days had
[46:40] seen that man let soldiers spit in his
[46:42] face. So here they were. They were
[46:44] walking. Their steps were, you know, I
[46:45] doubt very much they were skipping down
[46:47] the road to Emmas.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; They were walking with heavy hearts, you
[46:50] know, straightened, you know, short
[46:52] short steps, no doubt, just shoulders
[46:54] down and they're talking because their
[46:56] whole world in their opinion had fallen
[46:58] apart. But it was all according to God's
[47:00] plan. You see, and so disappointment had
[47:03] come in and someone, you know, someone
[47:04] comes and misconrs the word to you. Does
[47:07] it cause your cause to kind of shorten a
[47:10] bit?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, really? But I thought he said this
[47:12] and why are they saying this and all
[47:14] these kind of well that sand of man's
[47:16] opinion blows in. It gets harder to walk
[47:18] on the path. There's nothing wrong with
[47:20] you, nothing wrong with the path, but
[47:21] it's man's man's opinion, right? And God
[47:24] allows these things to come in that you
[47:27] know to prove his salvation in their
[47:29] lives. You see, they were walking this
[47:32] way not because of what they had done.
[47:34] They weren't backsliden. They had gone
[47:36] into sin. They weren't part of the
[47:37] howling mob that crucified the Messiah.
[47:39] It was God's ordained path for them.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Are you following me today? I mean, I
[47:44] believe you are. Amen. So, you see, it
[47:45] became a very complex time in their
[47:47] lives. Like David's life went simple to
[47:49] complex. Running from Saul, on the run,
[47:52] all these troubles around him, all these
[47:53] things, he was living in a complex time.
[47:56] And so, we are living in a complex age.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; In the dark ages, it was either repent
[48:01] or perish. You know, the word for burden
[48:03] is weight or pressure. The pressure of
[48:04] the dark ages was either to bend or be
[48:06] broken, bow or die. It was the
[48:08] Inquisition, the power of the empire
[48:10] backing up satanic worship. Uh, be
[48:12] organized or pay with your life. Each
[48:14] age has its pressures. For example, the
[48:16] great burden of the last age is the
[48:18] pressures of riches, soft living, and a
[48:20] nervous tension in a complex age we seem
[48:22] unfitted to live in. This is the age we
[48:24] live in. Now, I I pray I'm not painting
[48:27] too much of a bad picture because we're
[48:29] built to walk through it and overcome,
[48:31] right? But you see, there's a very
[48:32] complex age. Now this is this is uh
[48:34] Thornton Key I think it was or is rather
[48:37] in 1925
[48:39] early 1920s. Okay. So imagine imagine
[48:43] going back in that day contrasting it
[48:44] today.
[48:46] Everything's a lot less complex back
[48:48] there
[48:49] &gt;&gt; right? Can you imagine no phones, no
[48:51] internet, no computers, no electronics
[48:53] of any kind, no instant communications,
[48:55] no barrier of being, you know, you know,
[48:57] by a million opinions, no shopping
[48:59] malls,
[49:01] you know, but such a simple life.
[49:03] There's not all this complexity of
[49:05] things and arranging, you know, you
[49:08] hitch up the wagon. Imagine if we lived
[49:09] back in those days, I get a telegram
[49:11] from Pam. Brother Ed says, "I'm on my
[49:14] way." You know, how long would that take
[49:16] even with a car,
[49:18] &gt;&gt; you know? It's not, you know, and
[49:20] a lot less simple, but we don't live in
[49:24] that age. We live in this age, right?
[49:26] So, we can't go back to a horse and
[49:28] buggy era. No, we have to live in this
[49:30] time. And God has fully equipped us as
[49:33] they overcame in their age, we'll
[49:35] overcome in this age. Amen. So, there's
[49:37] all these complexities going on. There's
[49:39] a you know there's a there's a time of
[49:42] um you know this age is is is very much
[49:46] summed up in so this is from Pilgrim's
[49:48] Progress where they where they're just
[49:50] before the celestial city and they're
[49:51] walking along the enchanted ground and
[49:54] um you know they start falling asleep
[49:55] and wanting to rest a while and because
[49:57] the atmosphere of the of what they're
[49:59] walking through is is lulling them to
[50:01] sleep. And so this is the summary of
[50:03] what's going on there. So, as they near
[50:05] the end of their journey, they face
[50:06] another peril that is subtler and more
[50:08] harder to discern. They enter the
[50:10] enchanted ground, a city where the air
[50:12] tends to make unsuspecting travelers
[50:14] drowsy and lethargic. The enchanted
[50:16] ground represents dullness brought about
[50:18] by spiritual complacency and fatigue.
[50:21] So, so, so this is the age we live in.
[50:23] There's a there's a complacency in the
[50:25] world. Now, we got to realize, well, we
[50:26] know very well we live in Lady Oia.
[50:29] We're not of it, but we're in it. And it
[50:30] wants to affect us, right? But we've got
[50:33] to be able to withstand and we can
[50:34] withstand it and keep walking, right?
[50:36] God's anointed us to overcome. But you
[50:38] see, this is the atmosphere.
[50:40] Everything's so easy. There's no real
[50:42] hardship relative to 100 years ago, you
[50:46] know. But you see, so so there's a
[50:48] there's a complacency that can come in.
[50:51] There's a, you know, there's a whole
[50:53] even even Jesus would speak about this.
[50:55] Now, I'm just talking about the path
[50:56] that we're walking down at the moment.
[50:58] He says, "Take heed to yourselves, lest
[50:59] at any time your hearts be overcharged
[51:01] with um surfetting and drunkenness and
[51:03] the cares of this life, so that the day
[51:06] uh that day comes upon you unawares. For
[51:08] as a snare it shall come on the um on
[51:10] all them that dwell on the face of the
[51:12] whole earth. Therefore, watch ye
[51:14] therefore and pray always that you may
[51:15] be accounted worthy to escape all these
[51:17] things that shall come to pass and stand
[51:19] before the son of man."
[51:22] &gt;&gt; So, it's a snare that's come upon the
[51:23] whole earth. We live here, right? This
[51:25] is you know people are so you know
[51:27] mental health has gone through the roof
[51:29] and heart troubles and stresses and
[51:31] anxiety and all these things and I don't
[51:33] know what the percentage of people is it
[51:34] has to take and there's nothing wrong
[51:35] with it if you need it God gives doctors
[51:37] and medicine but you know people are on
[51:39] anti-depressants and suppressants and
[51:41] uppers and downers and all these things
[51:42] right we know the real cure is the Lord
[51:44] himself right but you see we live in
[51:46] this time of of everyone's anxious and
[51:48] stress and there's tension and all these
[51:50] things we live in such a complex time
[51:52] what's going to happen how we going to
[51:54] get out of this how's the world going to
[51:55] recover and all these things. No one
[51:56] knows the answer. You see? So, so it's
[51:59] become it's a snare upon the whole
[52:00] earth.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; But God rich in mercy
[52:04] &gt;&gt; has given us a way to walk over the
[52:06] snare. Amen. Cuz you got to realize
[52:08] you're fully dressed
[52:09] &gt;&gt; to walk through these conditions. Amen.
[52:11] Just like the brothers went hunting. I
[52:13] guess you would have been dressed for
[52:14] the occasion, right? You didn't go like
[52:16] this. No. Right. You were dressed for
[52:18] the conditions, right? And you're you're
[52:20] obviously what you wore kept you alive
[52:23] cuz you're here. Right? But you see, you
[52:26] plan for the conditions and God has
[52:27] pre-planned our dress wear for the
[52:30] conditions of this age. Amen. Which is
[52:32] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[52:33] We'll come into that soon. But you see
[52:35] what has also happened is is there's
[52:37] seems to be a delay in the Lord's
[52:39] coming. But the Lord has allowed this to
[52:41] happen. So now here's the sand of of of
[52:44] people's opinion saying, well, if the
[52:45] Lord has come or or the Lord's coming,
[52:47] why is it why is it delayed? You know,
[52:49] the world has continued on as it has
[52:51] from the beginning. But you know even
[52:53] even Jesus would speak about this in
[52:55] Matthew 24 and he would he would speak
[52:57] about how how you know there'd be the
[53:00] servants and one servant you know the
[53:02] evil servant would say in his heart the
[53:04] Lord delayeth his coming. So he doesn't
[53:06] say it out loud he says it in his heart.
[53:08] Then normally what you say in your heart
[53:10] then your life begins to manifest that.
[53:12] Amen. So what does he begin to do?
[53:13] Begins to be um he begins to smite his
[53:16] fellow servants. He begins to attack his
[53:18] his own team instead of he's lost he's
[53:22] lost focus on the goal. What is that
[53:24] goal? To get whosoever will let them
[53:26] come in drink of the waters of life.
[53:28] Meet the Lord himself. Amen. Become one
[53:30] with him. Have a true spiritual
[53:32] relationship with Jesus Christ according
[53:33] to his word. Amen. That is that is that
[53:35] should be the thrust of every Christian.
[53:37] Amen. I want them to know the same one
[53:39] that found me. Amen. I want I want
[53:42] everyone to know him and the power of
[53:43] his resurrection. that he's more than a
[53:45] religion like when we're Christian and I
[53:47] were driving down the hill you know and
[53:49] I was saying about the Apostle Paul he
[53:50] said you know he didn't say I know what
[53:52] I believe he said I know in whom I have
[53:54] believed that's a very different thing
[53:56] amen because if you know what you
[53:57] believe it's just a list of doctrine but
[53:59] if you know him I mean I know in whom I
[54:01] have believed the person that changes
[54:03] everything because it's not about an
[54:04] argument now and this person said this
[54:06] and this happened here no I know him
[54:08] you've come too late I met the Lord
[54:10] Jesus Christ himself
[54:11] &gt;&gt; amen
[54:12] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord so he begins smite his
[54:14] fellow servants and you know he you know
[54:16] he loses his vision. He loses his
[54:18] purpose. He tears down attacks and then
[54:20] what does he do? He begins to become
[54:22] drunk. He begins to drink with the
[54:24] drunken. Now this world is drunk.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; This world is teetering. You can have
[54:28] excess of anything you want in this day.
[54:30] Food, exercise, entertainment, sport,
[54:35] pleasure, money, whatever you want. You
[54:37] can just get drunk on. You can go wild.
[54:39] And was a drunk man doesn't walk in a
[54:42] straight line. Believe me, I've been
[54:44] there. I don't recommend it. You see,
[54:47] but you see, this is what happens. You
[54:49] know, people just just stumble from one
[54:51] thing to another. They'll stumble from
[54:53] one conspiracy theory to another
[54:55] conspiracy theory, one doctrine to
[54:56] another doctrine. They're just stumbling
[54:58] around. Why? Cuz they've got they're
[54:59] drinking with the drunken.
[55:02] Amen. But then what happens is, you
[55:03] know, it's But you see, and then they
[55:05] they begin to lash out, you know,
[55:07] because getting drunk on the world
[55:09] inflames old wounds. We see this in this
[55:12] day we live in. All these old wounds of
[55:14] the past have come out. And sure, things
[55:16] need to be fixed, but the only thing
[55:17] that can fix this world is the Lord
[55:18] Jesus, right? But you see, old wounds
[55:20] are inflamed and come out hurts and
[55:22] pains and you know, you know, they bring
[55:24] up resentments and things that should
[55:26] have been healed
[55:28] &gt;&gt; sadly. Amen. Now, you see, this is very
[55:30] different to being drunk on the spirit.
[55:33] Amen. This is very different to being
[55:34] drunk on the spirit of God. Praise the
[55:36] Lord. Amen. you know, being drunk on the
[55:38] wine of stimulation of revelation. Amen.
[55:41] Why? Because it because, you know, it
[55:43] brings a it brings a healing. It brings
[55:45] a calmness. It actually brings a
[55:46] stability of walk. Amen. When you're
[55:48] drunk on the spirit. Why? Because it
[55:49] brings everything into perspective.
[55:51] Being drunk on alcohol takes everything
[55:53] out of perspective. But being drunk on
[55:54] the Lord brings it into perspective.
[55:56] Amen. Just like in the third seal where
[55:58] where the Lord commanded that black
[56:00] horse rider, do not touch the oil and
[56:02] the wine. So the devil had to obey that
[56:04] commandment. Satan, you can't touch the
[56:05] oil and the wine. You can't touch my
[56:07] spirit moving. You can't restrict that.
[56:09] And you can't restrict the stimulation
[56:11] by the revelation of the word. Amen. As
[56:13] a supernatural commandment from the
[56:14] throne of God, Satan, you cannot stop
[56:16] that. Amen. So if it cannot be stopped,
[56:18] I say let it flow. Amen. Cuz it's the
[56:20] one thing that will heal you. One thing
[56:22] will help. Amen. When God pours in his
[56:24] oil and God pours in his wine, Amen. And
[56:27] he binds up the wounds. Amen. He'll
[56:28] strengthen you and give you peace. Amen.
[56:30] Amen. It's like the, you know, it's like
[56:32] the uh story of the good Samaritan.
[56:34] Sorry if I'm a bit loud. You could turn
[56:35] me down. I don't know. I feel like I'm I
[56:37] don't mean to shout. Okay, but you see I
[56:39] just get excited. But anyway, you see
[56:40] the story of the good Samaritan. It's
[56:42] more than just helping natural people.
[56:44] Sure. You know, naturally, you got to
[56:45] think about this where this man was
[56:48] traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho. So,
[56:50] Jerusalem's up on the hill. Jericho is
[56:52] the lowest city in Israel. So, what was
[56:54] happening? This man was actually
[56:55] backsliding. He's going from a high elev
[56:58] where the temple was, where God was, all
[56:59] these things down to a place that was
[57:01] actually cursed. Remember Joshua cursed
[57:03] that place. Cursed be the person who
[57:04] builds this place again. Right? So, so
[57:06] here was a man who was backsliding. And
[57:08] in the process of his backsliding, he
[57:10] got mugged. He got beaten up and left
[57:11] for dead. And that's what the world does
[57:14] &gt;&gt; to people. And he said, "Well, I'm just
[57:15] going to go out. I'm going to find
[57:16] myself and I'm going to be free and I'm
[57:18] going to do what I want. I tell you
[57:18] what, you'll end up like this."
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but you know those religious
[57:22] Levites and things, they could condemn
[57:24] him and say, "Well, you're in a bad
[57:25] way." But they couldn't help him. But
[57:27] then the Samaritan who had a who had a
[57:28] who had a bad name to begin with. Oh,
[57:32] you message people.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; You know, that's basically what it is.
[57:36] Oh, you're not you know, oh, look at
[57:38] you. But thing is, we carry something
[57:41] &gt;&gt; that can fix everyone. I mean, it can
[57:43] heal every wound. I mean, we carry the
[57:45] anointing of the word. Amen. That we can
[57:47] pour in oil. Isn't it strange? Have you
[57:49] ever seen a doctor pour oil and wine
[57:50] into wounds?
[57:52] &gt;&gt; You don't do that. Amen. This is not
[57:53] just He's not talking about natural
[57:55] wounds here. He's talking about
[57:56] spiritual wounds. Amen. Because you pour
[57:58] in, you don't pour oil and wine into
[58:00] wounds, but into spiritual wounds, you
[58:02] pour in the anointing of the Holy Ghost.
[58:04] I mean, you pour in the oil. Well, how
[58:06] do you do that? You create an
[58:07] atmosphere. It brings healing. Amen. It
[58:10] brings it brings deliverance. Amen.
[58:11] Where someone's all twisted up in their
[58:13] mind and trouble, but they spend time
[58:14] with you. What's happening? Then the oil
[58:16] begins, love is projected. Amen. The oil
[58:18] begins to be poured in. Amen. What
[58:20] happens is they leave you feeling
[58:21] lighter and better and happier. What's
[58:23] happened? Healing's taking place.
[58:25] Medicine's being poured in. Amen. And
[58:28] then you pour in the pour in the wine.
[58:30] The stimulation of the revelation of the
[58:31] word makes them happy. Gives them a
[58:33] spring in their step.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what we're made to do. So
[58:38] it's very different. I'd rather be drunk
[58:40] on that.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; It solved all my troubles.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; It's given me peace that passes
[58:45] understanding. Amen. When you start to
[58:46] drink of this message of the hour. Amen.
[58:48] It gives you peace that passes
[58:50] understanding. You forget your troubles.
[58:51] You realize the enemy that's against you
[58:53] is actually not that big after all. And
[58:55] you can take him. Amen. You can down
[58:56] that devil. Amen. You can walk
[58:58] triumphantly.
[58:59] Amen. This is just my experience anyway.
[59:01] I like being drunk on the spirit.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Make sure you forget all your
[59:05] troubles
[59:06] &gt;&gt; and it's not putting on blinkers. Amen.
[59:08] Now you realize I know in whom I have
[59:09] believed. It brings perspective.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Oh,
[59:17] praise God. Now,
[59:20] but we are we are told in the same token
[59:22] naturally to be sober. We don't want to
[59:25] be drunk on this world. We got to be
[59:26] sober as we walk. Our walk should be
[59:28] deliberate. You know, it's not a cosmic
[59:31] accident really. When you think about,
[59:33] you know, when you look at a Christian
[59:34] who's really overcoming. I'm not talking
[59:37] about how well their life is going, but
[59:38] in themselves they got victory.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; That that is deliberate.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; That is a deliberate thing. It's like an
[59:44] athlete, you know, like our, you know,
[59:46] like the All Blacks or some great some
[59:48] people wouldn't say great team, but some
[59:49] great team that goes to compete. It's
[59:52] not an accident. They just turn up and
[59:54] they win. They've been training. They've
[59:56] got a goal in mind. I'm I'm going to
[59:58] lift that trophy.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; This day is my day. This tournament is
[1:00:02] my tournament. It's deliberate, right?
[1:00:04] And should it not be the same with us?
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should be We should We should
[1:00:08] be deliberate in our day, Lord. Thank
[1:00:10] you. I've got another day to walk with
[1:00:11] you. Thank you, Lord, that you're going
[1:00:13] to reveal yourself to me. Thank you,
[1:00:14] Lord. You give me life in my body, Lord.
[1:00:16] I want to walk with you this day. Amen.
[1:00:17] Thank you, Lord. As I read your word,
[1:00:19] you're going to speak to me. Amen.
[1:00:21] Hallelujah. Who's with me this morning?
[1:00:23] You know, but but our walk should be
[1:00:24] deliberate. You know, it shouldn't be
[1:00:26] some cosmic accident that we get there.
[1:00:28] Should we know? Lord, you found me. Now
[1:00:29] I want to feed my experience, Lord.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. See, God has not
[1:00:34] appointed us to wrath, but to attain
[1:00:35] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:00:37] Amen. We're not the children of night
[1:00:39] that that day would overcome us. No,
[1:00:41] we're the children of light.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have light to walk in. We're
[1:00:45] not stumbling around. We're not trying
[1:00:46] to find our way. No, we know the way.
[1:00:49] Amen. But don't doubt the path that he's
[1:00:51] leading you down. No, it may be through
[1:00:53] mud, through swamp, through sand, of
[1:00:55] man's opinion, troubles, all these
[1:00:56] things. But I tell you what, friends, if
[1:00:58] you keep your mind on him, you'll have
[1:00:59] perfect peace. Amen. Amen. He will keep
[1:01:02] him in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:01:03] stayed on thee because he trusted in
[1:01:05] thee. Tell you what, if your mind is
[1:01:07] caught up in troubles and problems and
[1:01:09] how can this ever be and worries, that
[1:01:11] doesn't help anyone.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if your mind is on the word,
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're my deliverer. Didn't he
[1:01:16] deliver you from sin? Didn't he deliver
[1:01:18] you from unbelief? I mean then then then
[1:01:20] what is the compared to that? What is
[1:01:22] the enemy that you face? It's like Moses
[1:01:24] would tell the children children of
[1:01:26] Israel before they went into the land,
[1:01:27] remember what God did when you come into
[1:01:29] the land. Remember what God did to the
[1:01:31] Egyptians behind you? The Egyptians were
[1:01:33] the superpower of the age. Amen. The you
[1:01:35] know the kingdoms in the promised land
[1:01:36] weren't that big compared to Egypt.
[1:01:38] Egypt could have taken the whole place
[1:01:39] themselves naturally. So So he's telling
[1:01:41] you, look, what you've come out of is
[1:01:43] actually bigger than what you're facing
[1:01:44] in front of you.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You got to realize
[1:01:48] what you came out of darkness and sin
[1:01:49] and unbelief. That's far bigger. That
[1:01:51] that enemy that's under your feet
[1:01:53] already is far bigger than the one you
[1:01:54] face.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Trust ye in the Lord
[1:01:58] forever. For the Lord Jehovah is
[1:01:59] everlasting strength.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] Well, you say, well,
[1:02:10] how do we triumph?
[1:02:12] The same way the martyrs triumphed, the
[1:02:14] same way every age triumphed is by
[1:02:16] revelation. Because many he says be
[1:02:19] faithful unto death. He does not say be
[1:02:21] faithful until death but unto death. You
[1:02:24] may have to seal your testimony with
[1:02:25] your blood. Thousand j millions have
[1:02:27] died during all the ages. They died in
[1:02:29] faith like Antipus a faithful martyr.
[1:02:31] They held not their lives dear unto
[1:02:33] death. Often we think it would be
[1:02:35] impossible to be a martyr. But dare to
[1:02:37] recall that the faith that we daily use
[1:02:39] to triumph in Christ Jesus is the same
[1:02:41] faith that upholds the polycarps and all
[1:02:43] the martyrs. That the supreme faith will
[1:02:45] give supreme grace for the supreme hour.
[1:02:47] Blessed be God forever.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz we think how we don't have faith
[1:02:52] like that kind of faith you do.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; We're walking through different
[1:02:56] conditions than they did.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Right? But it's the same faith that they
[1:03:00] had is the same faith you have. And
[1:03:02] their faith that caused them to overcome
[1:03:04] is the same faith that will cause you to
[1:03:05] overcome this complex age.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what is the victory that
[1:03:12] overcometh the world? Even our faith
[1:03:14] revelation in the word. Amen. Gives us
[1:03:17] the victory. Now, this man is walking up
[1:03:19] a I guess it's a sandune, a desert. All
[1:03:21] these things, you know, it can be a
[1:03:23] difficult it can be a difficult thing to
[1:03:25] walk up these things. And many times,
[1:03:28] this is where our path takes us. Like
[1:03:30] David's path was taken to a dry and
[1:03:32] weary land. He wasn't dry. The Lord was
[1:03:34] with him. But he's walking through a dry
[1:03:36] and weary land. And so here's this
[1:03:38] person. He's walking uh you know the
[1:03:40] sandune or whoever he is. But you see
[1:03:42] and you know many times when we're
[1:03:43] walking these kind of ways our footing
[1:03:45] can be more difficult. It can be more
[1:03:47] laborious to walk
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; right and and we come into these places
[1:03:52] and we got to realize that God has
[1:03:53] ordained us to walk through them. Right?
[1:03:55] So it can be you know sand can be what
[1:03:57] what can it be? It can be anxiety. It
[1:03:59] can be stress. It can be worry.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; People being jealous of you.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; If you're anxious, that doesn't mean
[1:04:05] you're not a Christian.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; If you're feeling stressed, it doesn't
[1:04:08] mean you're not a Christian. David would
[1:04:10] say, "Lord, when my heart is
[1:04:11] overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that's
[1:04:13] higher than I." Amen. He was a believer.
[1:04:15] He He was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:17] You can say anointed. He was king. All
[1:04:18] these things. He said, "Lord, when my
[1:04:20] heart gets when my emotions get
[1:04:22] supercharged that I can't cope, Lord,
[1:04:24] lead me to the rock that's higher than
[1:04:26] I." And what is that rock? a revelation
[1:04:27] of who Jesus Christ is. Amen. You begin
[1:04:30] to think about him. I tell you what,
[1:04:31] stress begins to go down. I mean,
[1:04:33] anxiety begins to vanish. Amen. Why?
[1:04:35] Because you you because you're not
[1:04:36] looking at you anymore. You're looking
[1:04:38] at him. I mean, you're looking at his
[1:04:39] ability. Amen. His strength, his word. I
[1:04:42] mean, you're looking at what he has done
[1:04:43] for you already. Amen. Because if you're
[1:04:45] built upon that rock of revelation,
[1:04:47] nothing can move you from it. And God
[1:04:49] did not plant you to move you. He did
[1:04:51] not put you there to take you off one
[1:04:52] day. You're part of that rock.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It
[1:04:57] would say about the Philadelphiaian age,
[1:04:59] I'll make them a pillar in the house of
[1:05:00] our God. And the pillar is part of the
[1:05:02] foundation.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's you as well.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Sand can be hard
[1:05:09] to hard to walk to. Drags you down.
[1:05:11] Takes a lot of conscious effort. But
[1:05:13] just keep walking. You know, it's like
[1:05:15] walking through mud. I remember when I
[1:05:16] was at Gabriella's school camp. I know
[1:05:17] Lily and Analise were there as well the
[1:05:19] years before. You know, the um the boys
[1:05:21] were led by one of the ranger guys to
[1:05:23] walk through all this mud and some of
[1:05:25] some of them lost their shoes,
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; you know, but but walking through mud,
[1:05:29] you got to be real conscious of how
[1:05:30] you're walking,
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; right? But you got to realize the shoes
[1:05:33] you're wearing cannot come off.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're built to walk through mud.
[1:05:38] They're built to walk through sand.
[1:05:39] They're built to walk through trouble.
[1:05:41] They're built to walk through all kinds
[1:05:42] of conditions because you have the right
[1:05:44] footwear.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; But just because you're walking through
[1:05:46] mud doesn't mean the mud is part of you.
[1:05:49] Amen. It's like, you know, you go out,
[1:05:51] you get muddy, you realize the mud
[1:05:52] didn't come from me,
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; right? It came from the earth.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But many times, you know, we're
[1:06:00] walking through difficult places. We
[1:06:02] think we are the mud
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; or we are the sand
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; cuz all these man's opinions and trouble
[1:06:07] comes and things blow and all these
[1:06:09] things happen and no, you're not that.
[1:06:11] You're just walking through it.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; I trust this makes sense today. And you
[1:06:15] got to realize, you know, that we the
[1:06:18] mud didn't come out of us. It's not of
[1:06:20] us. See,
[1:06:23] you know, people say, "Well, I'm just a
[1:06:25] highly anxious person." You know, you be
[1:06:27] walking through sand or mud.
[1:06:28] Anxiousness. You know, I'm naturally a
[1:06:30] stressed ball. You know, I'm a
[1:06:31] firstborn, so I'm just highrung. That's
[1:06:33] how I am. Not necessarily.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be that way. You know,
[1:06:38] don't don't own the mud. Don't own the
[1:06:39] sand.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:45] See,
[1:06:48] I wanted to put this in for William. The
[1:06:50] whole armor of God.
[1:06:53] Praise the Lord. I like swords and
[1:06:54] stuff. Anyway, I'm a boy. But he said,
[1:06:57] but but you know, part of the armor is
[1:06:59] that your feet would be shaw with the
[1:07:00] preparation of the gospel of peace. This
[1:07:02] word peace means it means primarily it's
[1:07:05] a verb. It means to join, to connect
[1:07:06] together.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we need one another.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; We need one another.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to provoke one another to
[1:07:14] good works. To consider one another, to
[1:07:17] provoke unto love and to good works.
[1:07:19] Amen. We need one another cuz the cuz
[1:07:21] the journey can be hard sometimes.
[1:07:23] That's we need a brother or sister to
[1:07:25] take you by the shoulder and say, "Let's
[1:07:26] push."
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. You're going through
[1:07:28] something. I'm in it with you. Amen.
[1:07:31] You're going through a battle. Let's
[1:07:32] fight together.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You You're struggling. Well, I'm
[1:07:35] going to join your struggle. Amen. I'm
[1:07:36] going to help you because we love one
[1:07:37] another. What is that? That's provoking
[1:07:39] one another to good works. And what is
[1:07:41] that doing? That's that shows that your
[1:07:42] feet are shaw with the preparation of
[1:07:44] the gospel of peace.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you care for one another,
[1:07:47] you're dressed the right way. You're not
[1:07:48] leaving We're not leaving anyone behind.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, the Marines weren't the first one
[1:07:52] to have that saying, leave no one
[1:07:54] behind.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; The Christian had it long before that.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we so it's so so it means a
[1:08:02] joining or a connection.
[1:08:04] It's the same thing when you know same
[1:08:06] word when Jesus would say that you know,
[1:08:08] you go to a house that be worthy, let
[1:08:09] your peace come upon it. What do you do?
[1:08:11] you become joined to that house. But if
[1:08:13] it's not worthy, let your peace return
[1:08:14] to you. And it's that same where it
[1:08:17] says, you know, think that I not come to
[1:08:19] send peace on the earth, but I come to
[1:08:21] send pe I come not to send peace, but a
[1:08:24] sword. Why? Because the word divides. It
[1:08:26] doesn't join together. It separates
[1:08:28] light from darkness, faith from
[1:08:30] unbelief, sin from righteousness. That's
[1:08:33] that's what the word does. It separates
[1:08:34] these things. A not a joining at all.
[1:08:38] Amen. But we're dressed this way to
[1:08:40] stand in the evil day. I mean, God has
[1:08:42] dressed us to stand and walk and
[1:08:44] overcome in this age.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, you are built to
[1:08:47] walk through. Doesn't matter what
[1:08:48] condition that you're going through,
[1:08:50] you're built to walk through it.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; And we know the armor of God is not
[1:08:53] saying a prayer of like a Lord, I put on
[1:08:55] the helmet of salvation and the
[1:08:56] breastplate of righteousness and all
[1:08:57] these things. No, it is the baptism of
[1:08:59] the Holy Ghost. Your armor is
[1:09:01] supernatural. Amen. The shield of faith,
[1:09:03] that revelation, you hold up the quench
[1:09:04] of fiery darts. That's a supernatural
[1:09:06] thing. The sword of the spirit
[1:09:08] definitely is a supernatural weapon.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, Timothy would be written
[1:09:19] to see Timothy's journey was a difficult
[1:09:22] one at times just like every Christian.
[1:09:24] And so, Timothy had got to a spot where
[1:09:26] he where where he started to withdraw
[1:09:28] within himself because of struggles,
[1:09:30] because of attacks, because of all these
[1:09:31] things. So, Timothy would be encouraged
[1:09:33] by Paul. He says, "Greatly desiring to
[1:09:36] see you uh to to see thee, being mindful
[1:09:38] of thy tears, that I may be filled with
[1:09:40] joy when I call to remembrance the
[1:09:42] unfained faith that was in thee, which
[1:09:44] dwelt first thy grandmother Lois and th
[1:09:46] and thy mother Ununice, and I'm
[1:09:47] persuaded that is in thee also." Because
[1:09:50] it's easy to look at other people and
[1:09:51] say, "Well, they're Christians. What
[1:09:52] about me?" And so, the Apostle Paul's
[1:09:54] telling him, look, the faith you see in
[1:09:56] your grandmother and your mother is in
[1:09:57] you.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in you. You may not see it,
[1:10:00] Timothy, but it's there.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's operating. So he's saying
[1:10:03] now listen because of this stir up I put
[1:10:07] in thee in remembrance that thou stir up
[1:10:09] the gift of God. So Timothy whatever's
[1:10:11] tried to whatever path you're walking
[1:10:13] through that's difficult bring into
[1:10:15] remembrance where you've been what God
[1:10:17] has done. Amen. Stir up the faith that
[1:10:20] is within thee. The gift of God.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which was in putting which is in
[1:10:24] thee by putting on of my hands. For God
[1:10:26] has not given us a spirit of fear but of
[1:10:28] power and of love and of a sound mind.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what we're ordained to
[1:10:32] have.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I feel anxious. I feel
[1:10:34] fearful. I feel trouble." You got to
[1:10:36] realize the trouble's not you. The fear
[1:10:38] is not you. That's not who you're meant
[1:10:39] to be.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That, see, it's not us. You say,
[1:10:43] "Well, I must be lacking somewhere in my
[1:10:44] Christian walk." No.
[1:10:47] Why do we Why do we identify as sand,
[1:10:50] identify as mud? You know, I saw a
[1:10:53] bumper sticker on a a Jeep yesterday,
[1:10:55] diesel vehicle or whatever it was. It
[1:10:57] says I identify as an EV.
[1:11:00] No,
[1:11:02] but the devil wants us to identify with
[1:11:04] him as opposed to the word, right? Are
[1:11:08] we all are we all together? I think we
[1:11:09] are. Amen. But see, that's why it's so
[1:11:11] important when we go through something
[1:11:13] as difficult. Amen. That that we hear
[1:11:16] the word of God
[1:11:18] because we are washed by the water of
[1:11:21] the word.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a supernatural cleansing
[1:11:24] process when we open the word, when we
[1:11:27] come to church, when we hear the
[1:11:28] message. There's a supernatural washing
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; that takes that takes place. Amen. Where
[1:11:33] it's amazing where, you know, if we
[1:11:35] really could, you know, have a testimony
[1:11:36] service, I believe there'd be many of us
[1:11:38] would stand here. Even myself, I came in
[1:11:40] those doors anxious and troubled and
[1:11:42] worried. And I walked out feeling
[1:11:44] feeling at peace, stable, strengthened,
[1:11:47] settled. Why was that? Because before I
[1:11:49] walked in with a lot of sand or dirt of
[1:11:51] the enemy trying to bog down my walk,
[1:11:53] but then the word came and it washed me
[1:11:55] and it cleansed me. Amen. So now I can
[1:11:58] walk like I'm meant to walk. Amen. Why?
[1:11:59] Cuz we're washed by the water of the
[1:12:01] word. Amen. We're not washed by the
[1:12:03] water of man's opinion. Amen. That or or
[1:12:06] the water of man's tradition. That
[1:12:07] doesn't wash anything. Amen. Those
[1:12:09] things might satisfy a religious itch,
[1:12:11] but it ain't going to wash. Amen. No.
[1:12:13] See, it doesn't it isn't made of the
[1:12:16] right stuff. Amen. The waters of
[1:12:17] separation that wash. Amen. It is Christ
[1:12:19] the revealed word. That's what washes.
[1:12:22] Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It doesn't wash us that
[1:12:24] we just become a church member. No, it
[1:12:26] washes us till we get filled with the
[1:12:27] Holy Ghost. Amen. Transforms our life.
[1:12:30] Makes us new creatures in him. Amen. It
[1:12:32] washes off everything we walk through.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; You may have walked through a lot of
[1:12:36] difficult places this week. It may mean
[1:12:38] been like you're walking through a
[1:12:39] swamp. But I believe the word of God is
[1:12:41] here to wash that swamp from you. Amen.
[1:12:44] To give you strength and encourage you.
[1:12:45] Amen. It washes off all unbelief. It
[1:12:48] washes off all worry. It washes off all
[1:12:50] fear. It washes off jealousy. Washes off
[1:12:52] critical spirits. The word washes
[1:12:55] everything.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what this word does.
[1:12:58] Amen. It is the best soap, if I put it
[1:13:01] that way,
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; that there is.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz we're washed by the water of
[1:13:06] the word. That's why it's so important.
[1:13:08] You feel all tense and troubled, go to
[1:13:10] your laundry.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Go to the word of God.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Right? Get it out. Apply it. Let it
[1:13:17] change you. Say, "Lord, I'm going
[1:13:18] through I'm struggling." Lord, you go to
[1:13:20] your source of strength. Your anxiety is
[1:13:23] not source of strength. Your worries or
[1:13:25] double minders, that's not your source
[1:13:26] of strength. Your source of strength is
[1:13:28] is the word. And I've never seen I've
[1:13:30] never seen someone go to the word of God
[1:13:32] sincerely and say, "Lord, help me." And
[1:13:34] he doesn't or she doesn't stay unhelped.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; God in his season comes and it's just
[1:13:40] gone.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to you got to meet
[1:13:43] the devil head on with that sword of the
[1:13:44] spirit. Amen. Take that word of God and
[1:13:46] chop that opinion down. Chop that thing
[1:13:48] down and that question mark and all
[1:13:50] these things. Why? Because the devil
[1:13:52] wants to control you by fear. It's like
[1:13:54] the serpent speaking to Eve. Basically,
[1:13:56] she was he was putting fear on her.
[1:13:57] Basically, God's holding you back. God
[1:13:59] hasn't told you the whole truth. Yay.
[1:14:01] Hath God said if she took that sword of
[1:14:04] the spirit and chopped that down, we
[1:14:06] would never be in the position we're in
[1:14:07] this morning.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; But we we're all faced with that same
[1:14:10] battle.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Is it really true? Here comes man's
[1:14:13] opinion.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Does it really work? Yeah, it does.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Does this message really
[1:14:22] transform lives?
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Does it really cast out devils?
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Does it heal the sick?
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Does it prove the word is alive?
[1:14:30] Amen. Does he move among us? Has he not
[1:14:33] changed us? Amen. Has it not proved
[1:14:34] itself in 2025?
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, it has.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Man's opinion wants it to wants you to
[1:14:42] think everything else but that. Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm I'm going to Where
[1:14:49] are we doing? I won't be too much
[1:14:50] longer. I won't drag this on too long.
[1:14:52] Amen. But see, we have the waters of
[1:14:54] separation, which is Christ, the
[1:14:55] revealed word. It washes everything.
[1:14:58] Amen. You say, "Well, where'd you get
[1:14:59] that from?" Well, very simple that he
[1:15:01] would cleanse us. Cleanse us with the
[1:15:02] washing of the water by the word.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And that's why it's so important. You
[1:15:06] got to look at your look at your
[1:15:09] detergent and don't read the packet what
[1:15:11] it says it does. See what it does.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Advertising can be false. You know, we
[1:15:17] had these laundry sheets and we found
[1:15:19] out Consumer Magazine did a test and and
[1:15:22] and they said they're the worst.
[1:15:27] The packet said one thing. The proof of
[1:15:29] the pudding was the test.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Right. And I tell you what, friends,
[1:15:33] what's what's in the packet, it does
[1:15:36] what it says it would do
[1:15:38] of this word. Amen. It says, "For you
[1:15:40] were sometimes darkness, but now you are
[1:15:42] light in the Lord as walk as children of
[1:15:44] light." Amen. For the fruit of the
[1:15:46] spirit in all goodness and righteousness
[1:15:48] and truth, proving that what is
[1:15:50] acceptable unto the Lord. So testing by
[1:15:53] experience. Another another translation
[1:15:55] says what is acceptable unto Lord. So
[1:15:57] what what God accepts tested by
[1:15:59] experience.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I say. The word works.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; We've tested it. We've tasted and seen
[1:16:05] the Lord is good.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can walk with confidence
[1:16:08] through everything that the Lord is my
[1:16:11] strength. He's my shield. He's my all in
[1:16:12] all. Amen. He is more than able to
[1:16:15] fulfill what he promised. He said he
[1:16:16] would do.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:28] See, what happens is sometimes we walk
[1:16:29] into dry places,
[1:16:32] but we got to realize that, you know, a
[1:16:34] desert place can be a one where there's
[1:16:36] no water.
[1:16:38] And people can get into that place where
[1:16:40] they get out of fellowship with with one
[1:16:41] another in the church and out of
[1:16:42] fellowship with the Holy Spirit. It
[1:16:44] brings us to a dry place, a desert,
[1:16:46] nothing alive. Everything's got stickers
[1:16:47] on it. See a desert, a little cactus
[1:16:49] like that sticker on it. Do you know
[1:16:51] what that is? It's a precious little
[1:16:53] tender leaf that hasn't had no water.
[1:16:55] It's just wound itself up so tight till
[1:16:57] it's a sticker. And when you see
[1:16:59] somebody like that, maybe it's a
[1:17:00] precious soul that could have been
[1:17:01] watered, right? would have been tender
[1:17:03] little leaf or something, but instead of
[1:17:05] that, it's wound itself up till it's
[1:17:06] just a sticker just punching at
[1:17:08] everything, you know, finding fault. It
[1:17:09] only needs it. The only thing it needs
[1:17:12] is just water. That's all. It's just it
[1:17:14] just needs a revival or a breaking up, a
[1:17:16] refreshing from the Lord. It'll unfold
[1:17:18] its little self if you just put it to
[1:17:21] the water.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; You know, you carry a lot of water with
[1:17:24] you.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; You know, you carry a lot of water. And
[1:17:28] you got to be careful. Someone else's
[1:17:30] experience doesn't become your
[1:17:31] experience, right? They could be bunch
[1:17:34] of stickers and everything's wrong and
[1:17:35] all these things. You got to realize,
[1:17:37] no, hold on. Just because they're going
[1:17:38] through that, that doesn't mean that's
[1:17:40] me. It doesn't mean I have to become
[1:17:41] like that, right? No, but you've got
[1:17:43] water that you can actually refresh that
[1:17:45] person. Amen. You can you can create an
[1:17:47] atmosphere around you that causes those
[1:17:49] stickers to unfill.
[1:17:51] Hallelujah.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz we're not just armored, right?
[1:17:54] We're carrying water that we don't get
[1:17:56] thirsty. Amen. There's an artisian well
[1:17:58] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:18:00] flows out of our living waters, flow out
[1:18:02] of our bosom.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And not only that, but we have
[1:18:06] light to walk in.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus answered, uh, uh, are there
[1:18:13] not 12 hours in the day? If any man
[1:18:14] walketh in the day, he stumbleth not,
[1:18:16] because he seeth the light of the world.
[1:18:18] But if a man walk in the night, he
[1:18:19] stumbleth because there's no light in
[1:18:21] him. So, he doesn't say there's no light
[1:18:23] above him or in front of him. No, it's
[1:18:25] got to be in him. I mean, what is that
[1:18:27] light? Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust I'm not losing too many of
[1:18:31] you here. Amen. So, you see now what
[1:18:33] happens is is that's the almighty God
[1:18:36] that's in you. If the light is in you
[1:18:38] now, you're not walking by memory.
[1:18:40] You're walking by or or by what you've
[1:18:42] learned. You're walking by revelation.
[1:18:45] Amen. Christ is in you. Amen. You got to
[1:18:47] realize this path we're walking down.
[1:18:49] The Lord is my light and my strength. He
[1:18:51] is within me. Right? And one way to test
[1:18:54] if people are walking by a church
[1:18:56] culture or a church tradition or
[1:18:58] revelation which is light is it's like
[1:19:01] if you have a room that you know where
[1:19:03] all the furniture is but then you you
[1:19:07] know even if it's pitch black you could
[1:19:09] be taught where everything is. So for
[1:19:11] example if this place was pitch black
[1:19:13] you had a blindfold on but I showed you
[1:19:15] before that. Now listen, three steps
[1:19:16] forward, you go through the door, three
[1:19:18] steps forward, turn right, two steps,
[1:19:21] then walk about 20 steps, you'll be at
[1:19:23] the front, and then you'll find there's
[1:19:25] three steps to walk up to, and then then
[1:19:27] five more steps and there's a chair, sit
[1:19:29] down. If you learned that enough,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; you could walk by memory in a pitch
[1:19:33] black room, right? Because you've been
[1:19:36] taught that.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; But then now, what if I move the chair
[1:19:38] over there? What if the pews get moved
[1:19:40] around? And now you'd be bumping into
[1:19:43] everything. You'd be stumbling into
[1:19:44] everything. Why? Because you're just
[1:19:46] walking by what you've learned.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if if there's a light on,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; if the light is on, it doesn't matter
[1:19:52] what is rearranged, it doesn't matter.
[1:19:54] This whole place could be totally
[1:19:55] different, but because you can see
[1:19:57] because there's light in you, it doesn't
[1:19:59] matter what gets rearranged, you're not
[1:20:01] going to stumble and fall and kick over
[1:20:02] the furniture, right? And it's the same
[1:20:04] thing with the word. The devil tries to
[1:20:05] come in and rearrange things and bring
[1:20:07] trouble and all these things. You say,
[1:20:08] "No, there's the light of the Lord is in
[1:20:10] me. I mean, I'm walking this path not by
[1:20:12] memory, not by education, not by
[1:20:15] learning. No, but by revelation. I mean,
[1:20:17] why? Cuz Christ is in me. The light is
[1:20:19] in me. So, I know where I'm walking.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad that you because
[1:20:26] we are walking in a night time. Amen.
[1:20:29] The dawn has come, right? But we're I
[1:20:31] mean, we're walking in a night time,
[1:20:32] right? Christ is coming. You know what I
[1:20:34] mean? But you see, but because there's
[1:20:35] light in us, we don't stumble.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. man's opinion comes in, you can
[1:20:41] step around it,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; you know, like Yeah. Anyway, I'll leave
[1:20:44] that alone. Amen. But we are we are but
[1:20:48] then as we're walking
[1:20:51] sometimes we like we're walking through
[1:20:52] the jungle and you need a machete.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; All the all these vines and things try
[1:20:57] and entangle you, snare you, trouble
[1:20:59] you, all these things. But we've got the
[1:21:01] sword of the spirit to cut through
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; every vine, every entanglement. And you
[1:21:06] say, "Why am I walking through this
[1:21:07] muddy water or this all this complex
[1:21:09] things? It doesn't make sense." I say,
[1:21:10] "God's given you a weapon to cut
[1:21:12] through."
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. To cut through. And because you
[1:21:14] know who you are and you know that
[1:21:16] you've got light, it doesn't matter
[1:21:17] where you're stepping. That's
[1:21:18] irrelevant. I'm dressed for the
[1:21:20] occasion. Amen. I've got the tools to
[1:21:22] get out and God is with me.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you take the sword of
[1:21:26] the spirit and you can chop through
[1:21:28] everything that tries to entangle you.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when Jesus was there in
[1:21:32] the you know you know in the in the
[1:21:34] wilderness there it said the spirit of
[1:21:36] God led him there to be tempted of the
[1:21:38] devil. Amen. Jesus had all the fine
[1:21:40] qualities of God in him. Do you believe
[1:21:42] it? He had powers upon powers. But when
[1:21:44] he met Satan he never used his power. He
[1:21:46] gave an example for the weakest of
[1:21:48] Christians. When he met Satan he said it
[1:21:50] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:21:52] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:21:54] out of the mouth of God. The weakest
[1:21:55] Christians I mean the weakest Christian
[1:21:57] can take that stand hold it. Sure. God
[1:22:00] is um God's in his word. Every time when
[1:22:02] he met the enemy, he said, "It's
[1:22:04] written." I believe he had power to do
[1:22:05] it. But he met Satan on the same grounds
[1:22:08] with the same word that you can meet him
[1:22:10] with everyone. It's written.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the weapon we have Jesus used
[1:22:15] to combat the enemy.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the weak, you say, "I'm not
[1:22:18] feeling very strong in faith." You're
[1:22:20] more than enough.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; You're more than enough. Amen. To take
[1:22:22] that sword and chop the enemy down.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's go back to our tour on
[1:22:30] the way to kind of left them and we've
[1:22:32] gone here and now we're coming back
[1:22:33] again. And so they walked very heavy
[1:22:36] down that road. Disappointments had come
[1:22:38] in. People's opinion, things have been
[1:22:39] misconstrued. They're walking there. But
[1:22:41] the whole time they are wondering about
[1:22:43] what's going on. The Lord Jesus was
[1:22:45] right with them. And then finally they
[1:22:47] came, you know, so it's like they're
[1:22:48] walking through mud. They're walking
[1:22:49] through sand. It was difficult. You know
[1:22:51] that walk that was on the way to it. It
[1:22:53] was a difficult walk for them. But as
[1:22:55] they are walking, the Lord was just
[1:22:56] quickening the scripture to their lives.
[1:22:58] It's meant to be this way. Look at the
[1:23:00] prophecy. Look at the shadow. I mean,
[1:23:02] it's meant to be an evil age, a dark
[1:23:05] age, a troublesome age. All these
[1:23:07] questions of, you know, got to be
[1:23:08] floating around, all these things. But
[1:23:10] you see, but but then he came but then
[1:23:12] they came to the village. They came to
[1:23:15] the village and they and and it looked
[1:23:16] like he was going to walk by and they
[1:23:18] said, "Come come stay with us. The day
[1:23:19] is spent." Now, it took them about 6
[1:23:21] hours to walk there through that mud,
[1:23:23] through that trouble. Jesus was walking
[1:23:25] with him the whole time. And then
[1:23:27] finally they came into the house. He
[1:23:29] actually sat down at the head of the
[1:23:30] table and he broke the bread and he gave
[1:23:32] it to them. Then their eyes came open
[1:23:34] and he you know he vanished right? So he
[1:23:36] did something that he did before the
[1:23:38] crucifixion. Right? He manifested
[1:23:40] himself in the same way he did before
[1:23:41] the crucifixion you know when he fed the
[1:23:43] multitudes right and their eyes came
[1:23:44] open. Now when they because of that when
[1:23:47] they went back to Jerusalem it wasn't a
[1:23:50] trudging walk of a downcast way. They
[1:23:53] ran they walked the same path but they
[1:23:55] ran it. took them like an hour to run
[1:23:57] back to Jerusalem. Amen. So, so, so one
[1:24:00] moment on the path, it was like walking
[1:24:02] through mud. And then after the Lord
[1:24:03] Jesus manifested himself, proved his
[1:24:06] word, their eyes came open. Lord, you've
[1:24:07] been with us the whole time through this
[1:24:09] tregery of this complex age we live in
[1:24:11] and you've been here the whole time.
[1:24:12] Their eyes came open. They ran back to
[1:24:14] the disciples. We have seen him alive.
[1:24:17] Amen. He has proved his word. Amen. He
[1:24:19] is alive and well. Amen. So, what did
[1:24:21] they do? They ran.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't a muddy, hard walk
[1:24:25] anymore. Oh, no. It was easy.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he came and answered their
[1:24:30] questions. And how did he do it? By
[1:24:32] manifesting himself.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; By proving himself. And I tell you what,
[1:24:35] friends, has he not done that time and
[1:24:37] time again? I'm not even just talking
[1:24:38] about in the prophets ministry. What
[1:24:40] about today?
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Has he not proved his word
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; constantly? Has he not proven himself
[1:24:44] alive? He's broken the bread of life and
[1:24:46] given it to us. Amen. He's quickened it
[1:24:49] to our souls. Our eyes have come open.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can say he's alive. Messiah is
[1:24:54] here upon the earth. Jesus Christ is the
[1:24:56] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:24:58] Amen. And what will that do? That will
[1:24:59] give you strength.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. In this in this complex age, you
[1:25:03] got to realize we're in this world, but
[1:25:05] not of this world.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, all this is going on, don't
[1:25:09] let it affect you. It'll try and grip
[1:25:10] you. It'll try and trouble you. You got
[1:25:12] to realize, no, I have been built.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; God has dressed me
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; to walk through this age. That's what
[1:25:18] the message of the hour has done. has
[1:25:19] dressed us in the true baptism of the
[1:25:21] Holy Ghost with the true sword of the
[1:25:23] spirit. We've seen it cut down demons.
[1:25:25] We've seen it cut down sickness. We've
[1:25:27] seen it bring deliverance. We've seen it
[1:25:29] bring the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:30] We've seen it bring prodals home. We've
[1:25:32] seen it done many mighty things that he
[1:25:34] promised it would do.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the weapon you have, well,
[1:25:38] that was someone else that did that. The
[1:25:40] same weapon is in your hand.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Take the word of God. You say, "Well, I
[1:25:43] don't feel like I'm a Christian." We
[1:25:44] don't walk by feeling. We don't walk by
[1:25:46] sight. We walk by faith. Amen. So don't
[1:25:49] walk. You say, "Well, I'm going through
[1:25:50] a hard time." The road will change.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Who's with you in the easy times? The
[1:25:54] Lord. Who's with you in the hard times?
[1:25:56] The Lord. So keep walking. You say, "I'm
[1:25:58] never going to get out of this swamp."
[1:26:00] Oh yeah, you will.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; God wants to prove that you're not a
[1:26:03] fair weather Christian.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like, you know, I used to be
[1:26:06] sailing when I was young and I came to a
[1:26:08] point where I'm not a fair weather
[1:26:09] sailor.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; If it's if it's blowing a gale, I'm out
[1:26:12] there. If it's still, I'm out there. I'm
[1:26:14] out there in any condition
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; cuz I enjoy being out there. It's the
[1:26:18] same thing being a believer, right?
[1:26:19] We're not fair weather Christians.
[1:26:20] Trouble comes up, we walk with God.
[1:26:22] Sickness strikes us, we walk with God.
[1:26:24] Amen. Questions come up, we walk with
[1:26:26] God. There doesn't seem to be an answer,
[1:26:28] we walk with God. Amen. Why? Because we
[1:26:30] know he's walking with us and he's built
[1:26:32] us to walk through everything.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I just want to finish
[1:26:36] there this morning. But in summary, you
[1:26:39] may be going through something hard. You
[1:26:41] may be going feel like you're walking
[1:26:42] through sand. You're not the sand. Maybe
[1:26:44] you feel like you're walking through
[1:26:45] mud. It's very hard. hard slog. You're
[1:26:48] not the mud. What you're walking through
[1:26:50] is not you. It's just the path that God
[1:26:52] has ordained you to go down. It's not
[1:26:54] because he's annoyed at you. Not because
[1:26:55] he's disappointed in you. No, he wants
[1:26:57] to prove his word.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he has confidence in you
[1:27:02] that in your walk, you'll come to a
[1:27:04] stage you'll say, "Lord, I need you in
[1:27:06] this moment."
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And he'll say, "I've been waiting for
[1:27:09] you to say that."
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in his season, he steps
[1:27:13] in. Even this morning, steps in.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what does he do after we've
[1:27:17] been through those things? We get
[1:27:18] washed.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're washed by the water of the
[1:27:21] word. Cleanse us so we can walk out
[1:27:23] happy, free, and rejoicing. The
[1:27:25] situation out there may not have
[1:27:26] changed, but we've changed.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God has dressed us to overcome
[1:27:31] all things.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's stand this
[1:27:34] morning.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians, please.
[1:27:47] Amen. I want to sing that song that we
[1:27:49] um uh that you finished with Josh. Uh
[1:27:50] yet not I but Christ in me. Yet not I
[1:27:54] but through Christ in me. Amen. Let's
[1:27:57] sing this this morning.
[1:27:59] Praise the Lord. You happy to be a
[1:28:00] Christian today? I trust you are a
[1:28:02] believer. You given your life. You say,
[1:28:03] "Well, will he ever take me in?" He
[1:28:05] takes in anyone.
[1:28:07] Takes anyone. Amen. It's not who we are.
[1:28:11] We can't earn anything. It's what he has
[1:28:13] earned.
[1:28:14] Amen. He's such a merciful God.
[1:28:17] Amen. Let's just rejoice this morning.
[1:28:22] Oh,
[1:28:24] sorry. Of grace is Jesus my redeemer.
[1:28:31] There is no more
[1:28:34] for heaven now to give.
[1:28:39] He is my joy, my righteousness and
[1:28:44] freedom,
[1:28:47] my steadfast love,
[1:28:50] my deep and boundless peace.
[1:28:57] My hope is only Jesus
[1:29:03] for my life
[1:29:05] is wholly bound to him. is.
[1:29:11] Oh, how strange and near fine I can
[1:29:15] sing. All is mine, yet not I, but
[1:29:21] through Christ
[1:29:23] in me.
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:37] The night is dark, but I am not
[1:29:42] forsaken.
[1:29:45] For by my side,
[1:29:48] the Savior, he will sing.
[1:29:51] [Music]
[1:29:52] I labor on
[1:29:55] in weakness and rejoiceing.
[1:30:00] For in my need,
[1:30:03] his power is displayed.
[1:30:08] To this I hold. My shepherd will defend

[1:36:24] But Lord, you know the many times I've
[1:36:28] gone astray.
[1:36:32] But I've left it stronger than my
[1:36:37] weakness.

[1:36:48] No one else has ever cared for me like

[1:38:41] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's pray together.
[1:38:43] Amen. Lord Jesus, thank you, dear God.
[1:38:46] Father, we know whatever path you've
[1:38:47] ordained us to walk. You'll lead us
[1:38:50] through, my God. You'll give us
[1:38:51] strength, Lord. Thank you. You've
[1:38:52] dressed us to walk through every
[1:38:54] condition, my God. Thank you. You've
[1:38:56] given us the sword of the spirit, Lord,
[1:38:57] to chop through every obstacle. Thank
[1:38:59] you, dear God, that Lord, Lord, we got
[1:39:01] the right footwear on, my God, to walk
[1:39:03] through maybe muddy places, difficult
[1:39:06] times, sand of man's opinion, dry
[1:39:08] places. Lord, whatever it is, dear God,
[1:39:10] we know, Lord, that you will see us
[1:39:11] through, Lord, because you've led us
[1:39:13] through the valleys, Lord. You've led us
[1:39:15] over mountains, my God, through bri
[1:39:16] patches and fire and flood and all kinds
[1:39:19] of things. You've led us through, my
[1:39:20] God. So, I pray, dear God, as we walk,
[1:39:22] Lord, into this week now, whatever we're
[1:39:24] facing, may we just have a renewed
[1:39:26] confidence, Lord, a renewed faith in
[1:39:28] you. I pray that you'll give us such a
[1:39:31] strength, Lord, that we would just
[1:39:32] realize, Lord, such a stability. May we
[1:39:35] realize, Lord, what we're walking
[1:39:36] through is not us. It's just the
[1:39:37] environment we're going through, the
[1:39:39] conditions, the situations. Lord, we may
[1:39:41] be going through a complex age, but
[1:39:43] thank you, Lord. You've built us to
[1:39:45] overcome and walk victorious. So,
[1:39:47] Father, I pray you bless each one here.
[1:39:49] Strengthen them, my God. Pour in your
[1:39:50] oil and your wine of your word, Lord,
[1:39:52] and just strengthen each one, Lord. Give
[1:39:54] us a renewed step, Lord, like the two on
[1:39:56] the way to Emmas after you revealed
[1:39:57] yourself. Grant it, dear God. We love
[1:39:59] you, Lord. We thank you for your great
[1:40:01] mercy in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you,
[1:40:07] friends. So Mo's got a testimony, you
[1:40:09] know. Amen. So you can have your seats.
[1:40:11] You'd love to hear that. Amen. So God
[1:40:13] bless you.
[1:40:17] We'll just get this going.
[1:40:25] Oh,
[1:40:28] God bless you, saints. Um, so I just
[1:40:31] wanted to come and tell a little
[1:40:32] testimony because I feel like the Lord
[1:40:35] does things in our lives that if we
[1:40:37] don't share them, we're just going to
[1:40:38] forget them and they're just going to go
[1:40:40] into dust, right? So, I feel that I need
[1:40:42] to share this because So, we came to
[1:40:46] Oakland on Wednesday. We drove up there
[1:40:48] to pick up my sister and so we came back
[1:40:51] last night, came pretty late about 12:34
[1:40:54] and then prayed everything, went to bed.
[1:40:58] Now, normally I'll put on my laptop to
[1:41:01] get an alarm so we can wake up in the
[1:41:02] morning for Sunday. And I'll put on the
[1:41:05] life of the prophet because he doesn't
[1:41:07] access the internet. So, I couldn't put
[1:41:08] on like the message or the Bible. So, I
[1:41:10] just put that on so it stays on, right?
[1:41:12] And so, I was listening and I was trying
[1:41:14] to fall asleep and I got to I think it
[1:41:17] was chapter 16 and it was telling about
[1:41:19] how her sister came to brother
[1:41:21] Brandham's house and she was asking to
[1:41:23] pray for her because she had
[1:41:25] accidentally backslid, right? And so as
[1:41:29] he was casting the devil out of her,
[1:41:31] right, the lady that was telling the
[1:41:33] story, she says that um as soon as he
[1:41:35] mentioned the name of Jesus,
[1:41:37] then everything in the room started
[1:41:40] shaking and the the door started banging
[1:41:41] and stuff like that. And in my dream,
[1:41:43] right, so I was obviously half awake. I
[1:41:45] be making some food and I I wanted to
[1:41:48] say amen in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:51] But immediately when that happened, I
[1:41:52] couldn't say Jesus' name. So I
[1:41:54] immediately knew that this is an attack
[1:41:55] from the devil. And since I can't speak,
[1:41:58] he doesn't want me to say Jesus's name.
[1:41:59] So I just kept on trying and I couldn't
[1:42:00] speak. It was like my mouth was not even
[1:42:02] there. So I just kept on trying and
[1:42:05] trying and trying. And I started waking
[1:42:07] up and waking up and I said, "Jesus,
[1:42:08] Jesus, Jesus." And I shouted his name,
[1:42:11] right? And then I knew and the spirit of
[1:42:13] God came into the room, just started
[1:42:14] praying and casting the devil because he
[1:42:16] was in there. He was trying to constrict
[1:42:17] us. He was trying to destroy our sleep
[1:42:20] or something like that, right? And so
[1:42:21] that was just a really encouraging thing
[1:42:23] that I saw because these little things
[1:42:25] that the devil can come and just try to
[1:42:27] attack you and try to make you feel like
[1:42:29] you're you're low, right? But we're
[1:42:30] actually above him. It's Jesus is
[1:42:33] actually there. He's actually
[1:42:34] intervening in our lives, right? I just
[1:42:36] wanted to share that. Amen. God bless.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Thanks, man. I
[1:42:49] appreciate that. Amen. There's power in
[1:42:51] the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:42:53] The devil's defeated. Amen. Can we Can
[1:42:55] we just sing one more song? Can you
[1:42:56] humor me? I want to sing that song.
[1:42:58] Lord, there's nothing better than you.
[1:43:00] Yeah. I search the world. It couldn't
[1:43:02] kill me. Yeah. Can we sing it? Can we
[1:43:03] stand? Can we just sing that and then
[1:43:05] Yeah. services? Yeah. If you could sing
[1:43:07] that, that'd be amazing.
[1:43:12] And I searched the world,
[1:43:15] [Music]
[1:43:17] but it could have failed me.
[1:43:23] The man's empty praise
[1:43:26] treasures of faith were never enough.
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:33] You came home
[1:43:36] [Music]

[1:56:55] for mercy.
[1:56:58] He rule
[1:57:01] my life.
[1:57:03] [Music]
