musicians thank you brother Jimmy Amy and appreciate the music this morning um praise the lord we um yeah so God bless everyone how's everyone today everyone's good yep thank you praise the Lord um let's go to the scripture we're going to go straight to the scripture this morning um we're going to go to Luke 13 again there's a slideshow wait I need to maybe I should just do it old school and just get some batteries so Luke 13 we're going to continue well I'm going to use the same scripture as last Sunday we're going to go in a totally different direction um all right can we drive oh I can drive cool praise the Lord Luke 13 and 10. and we're going to read from Mark um as well so Luke 13 and 10 we're going to read down to um verse 13 again and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could have no wise lift up herself and when Jesus saw her he's he called her to him and said unto her Woman Thou Art loose from mine infirmity and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified God praise the Lord so she was loosed amen and then if we go back to Mark 11 and we're going to read I have it on this I'm here Mark 11 and 22. um we're just familiar piece of scripture for for us all I'm sure but Mark 11 and 22 says and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for Billy I say unto you that whosoever shall sand to this mountain be thou removed and um and beta removed and bid our cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what's the thing what things however ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand uh praying forgive for if you have ought against any that um that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses praise the Lord but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses amen so amen who must be forgiven praise the Lord Let's uh bow heads in a word of prayer this morning if you have a need you just want to raise your hand before the Lord amen he sees all of our needs and burdens dear Lord Jesus we are so thankful you're mindful of everything that's going on in our lives Lord there's not a moment Lord that we're out of your sight Lord I'm so thankful Lord that you always behold us oh God you always watch watch Upon Us Lord to Lord just to look after us Lord thank you that everything that happens in our lives is working for our good Lord we may not understand in the very moment but Lord we can trust Our Lives in Your Hands knowing Lord that nothing can truly go wrong in our lives dear God because it's working for our good Lord we just want to remember especially sister Hira this morning Lord as she's unwell and body father I pray you would be Lord if they're watching the service this morning may he touch your lord Jesus and Lord just may heal a body father restore her Lord God whatever her need is Lord I pray you admit it for your glory Lord we're so thankful that we can claim your claim healing for one another because by your stripes Lord we are healed and dear God as we have read your great Eternal Word I pray Lord that you the great author would once again Walk Among Us and speak to every heart Lord may you anoint speaker and hear her one more time lord we love you we're so thankful we can say it's well with our souls Lord because Lord you knew it wasn't but so Lord you made a way Lord Jesus Lord through your blood through your cross Lord we bear our sins no more we can say it as well with our souls we thank you so much dear God we love you just want to commit Our Lives once again into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning I want to um I want to go into so these actually it's kind of well not random but interesting that these last scriptures we read as the last two services that I've taken but I want to go into uh how uh I want to go into the third pool this is going to be a bit of a teaching but you know just sit and if you get a bit tired stand up and yeah we'll have a praise break maybe but you know um but it's very important because because things can uh misunderstandings can can can put us into a prison now brother Branham has this dream and I just want to go through this we're going to break it down but this is a works as Faith Express in one of his last sermons he preaches now I had a dream the other morning I don't dream very often I'm not a dreamer but I dream that I've seen a man a young fellow in shackles he was trying to get out and I said somebody told me those are horrible people have nothing to do with them I've seen this young fellow getting out of his shackle so I just let him alone I thought well I'll just see what he does and so when he got out he was a nice fellow and I seen others trying to get out now this is only a dream and I walked over this way I've seen a brother Roy borders a very good friend of mine lives in California looked like there was something wrong his eyes were half closed and great big maybe cancer or something over his eyes and someone was trying to pull me away from my screen brother borders and the name of the Lord Jesus snap out of that now this is all symbolic right but this applies to a lot of situations in life in our walk with God and he could just barely speak to us and brother Brown it'll have to take something more than this I just can't grasp it brother Baron I just can't grasp but I said oh brother borders I love him and someone pulled me away and I looked and there was a lady standing over here um that I when I was a little boy I used to haul groceries from the grocery store to the people and her name was Mrs Fenton she lives in Jefferson Jeffersonville yet a personal friend to the wife and I and she said brother Bram Deliver Us from us I said this is a house of hell now notice this he said you've been misunderstood and these and you misunderstand these people too these are fine people but I looked over there at a great big seller or big walls down beneath a great big cave and some great big iron bars eight or nine inches thick and people out of their mind twisting arms and legs beating their heads like this and she was crying saying deliver the people brother Brown and said help us we're in trouble she herself I know her she belongs to I believe the Church of Christ or the Christian church called The Church of the Brethren now I'm just going to stop it just well let's just read through them we're going to break this down I looked around and said I wish I could and going on looking around and little and my little bitty body and them great big iron bars and those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them them iron bars were sitting close together and I looked and they were beating their head out like they're going out of their mind and I've seen some lights flickering around in there I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with the lights of a rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me said deliver those people he went away I thought well how could I deliver them I haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bars so I said House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and all the creaking and popping and rocks rolling and bars falling and the people running and screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and all was delivered amen now that may seem like just a dream but it's amazing how how people can misunderstand and it can cause them to inter actually enter a prison now notice as I've highlighted a few these these these things here so so these people are Christian people in this dream they're not unbelievers they're not even some other religion they are they're Christian people they're good people but you see people can people can see see this Roy Boris was actually a close friend of brother Branham but you see so so this is all a symbolic dream we understand he wasn't literally having cancer over his eyes they weren't literally in a prison all twisted up and mangled but it was it was relating to a spiritual condition of a people that misunderstood and you see he says I just can't grasp it brother bear I just can't grasp it he couldn't grasp what God was doing in his day and I think the reason is he was mentally trying to understand what was going on and when you try and mentally put the word together you'll never be able to grasp it you know you know the Bible is not a textbook that we learned or the spoken word is not a textbook that we learn it's actually God revealing himself but we have to prayerfully say Lord reveal yourself to me it's actually a relationship Lord I want to know you more basically he was trying to grasp it in his mind and he couldn't do it but you see so spiritually now he is in this prison because he didn't understand what was going on but the cancer over his eyes he could barely see why because that was his spiritual condition and so we don't want to ever end up in a way that we don't you know we just can't see spiritually you know you know how we're doing spiritually you know this morning if this was a natural doctors would take you know heart pressure and pulse and all you know take different um you know Bloods and odds and whatever more but how about spiritually today how are we doing how are you feeling you've just come into a doctor's office I didn't think you'd really think about that when you came here but here we are in a doctor's office and the great Physicians here aiming to take care of us you see but notice this now brother see see the reason they are in this house of hell is because he uh this woman saying this Mrs Fina is saying you have been misunderstood so a misunderstanding caused these people to end up in the spiritually Twisted condition and they and they because they didn't misunderst you know they misunderstood him now how easy is it from a misunderstanding to put us into a prison you know where we can misunderstand one another and we can become spiritually twisted up because of misunderstandings between one another you know at prison people act differently in a prison they do when they're walking free you know when you're in prison you gotta You Gotta Wear prison clothes you eat prison food you do prison things right you don't walk free don't just decide I'm gonna go drive and see this person go to the shop no no you're stuck in a prison and this is what a misunderstanding or a complex can can can do to someone is is it actually puts them into a prison mentality now when they're around everyone else they can be themselves when they come to the presence of the person with the misunderstanding they go into a prison mentality they begin to act different their character changes their nature changes when they're around that person and it's not because of the person it's a misunderstanding to that person we must be very careful we can discern the body of the Lord look Beyond carnality look Beyond this human flesh and actually discern actually we're all the body of Christ amen so we don't let misunderstandings put us into put us into a prison see these people all these people all twisted up because they misunderstood brother Brandon you can say they misunderstood the word now it's very unfortunately this this can happen in the same way with us is that is that people can be Believers can be twisted up uh now now I went from just talking about just misunderstandings between one another so you're going to think about it how do you act around everyone should be the same Jesus was Jesus around everyone he was Jesus to the Pharisees he was Jesus to the blind man he was Jesus to Legion he was Jesus to his disciples he was the same person we should be the same to everyone Jesus didn't have complexes he could have got a lot of them but he didn't have any right because he stayed surrendered to to the father in him right so I suppose the same thing with us we should be the same to everyone we should be I should be bent to you I should be Bend to the person on the street been to whoever I should be the same person I shouldn't be different because I come into the prince of someone else right because if I do then then I'm in a prison because of a misunderstanding or a complex I've got to be loose from that amen but I'm so glad we could say House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ amen we're not we're not we're not called to be bound we're actually called to be loose to walk free with our lord Jesus so you see now these people were in a prison because of misunderstanding now unfortunately the enemy Believers become um misunderstand the prophet and the word of God by preachers that twist the scripture in quotes and then spiritually people get all up trapped in a prison again amen but they get trapped by misunderstandings and I'm at the very least or false doctrines at the worst and actually Believers like these ones get caught up spiritually in a house of hell now I wasn't expecting a bunch of hallelujahs right now but you know I just want to take this through because you know God is here to loose us like we read there about the woman in the synagogue there that that the Lord called her to himself to loose her and I believe this is the hour where the Bride of Jesus Christ has been loosed to fulfill her role in the end time amen that we're not here to be bound down and troubled and and in a prison of House of hell because we misunderstand or you know a false Doctrine has got us bound but we're here to be loosed Amen to walk with God as he wants us to walk is everyone following me this morning amen because God wants us to walk with him right that's that's the very reason he revealed himself to you is that you'd walk with him amen praise God so you know he says you have been misunderstood and you misunderstand these people so actually God went after him when he got corrected him when he was saying there's all these bunch of rookies and rakitas in these denominations he said God said don't call them that because they are my children they just have to come out and walk with me so we should you never have a bad attitude someone can actually be you know you're you're your attitude towards someone can actually dictate to them their Eternal destination that's why we should always be loving and caring doesn't matter who it is we should be the same to everyone which never ever put someone in a box and say that's them that's their lot who says are you God I'm not I'm Not Jesus right I'm not God he knows the end from the beginning he knows where they're going to end up so let that to God right if we can just get someone just one step closer to God praise God I think that's well worth it right I ain't meant to encourage someone just to keep walking in whatever light they have praise the Lord I think that's well worth it so you know we must never write people off because remember God has different you know there's the bride there's the church there's all different kind of people in heaven it's not just the bride and God and that's it right so we never want to just write people off we always want to have a real love and a real faith for them amen that God can do a greater work in their lives that's how we want to be so we don't ever want people to be stuck in a house of hell because of our misunderstandings of them amen Hallelujah so misunderstandings now there's a lot of things that people will misunderstand and have misunderstood in this message that have actually bound them down and and if you've been in this in these boats we're here to just say you can walk free because it's such a it's such a trap I don't know I need like three different devices just actually oh boy okay because I got my notes I got my slides on here what's next I got my notes what I'm going to say about those slides here I've got this to drive that so man this is way too technical but I wanted to put everything up on the PowerPoint so you could um follow along and I knew where I was going to so we don't want to we don't ever want to be caught now now a big thing all right network error okay we'll just forget about that okay we're just going to run with this okay so but you see now you see so did I do that I shouldn't even be allowed this but you see now so so they were stuck in this place but then some lights begin to flicker in around there so God began to come upon the scene because God doesn't want us Bound in any way he wants us free amen but you see now God uses his body to free his people that's why the Lord told Brother Baron and the dream you loose them because God works through the body right sister brother Bram and his physical in his physical ability of course could not and we in our physical ability cannot free anyone but you've got to speak the word in faith and then God can act on the word you say Amen so it's so important that we say the right thing praise a lot so so House of how good waste of them are Jesus Christ and all was delivered now a classic example of this I'm just going to break down a few of these is that people you know so we all know the story brother but I'm told of when he was translated beyond the curtain of time right it was more than a dream more than a vision but it was literally there he saw all the redeemed and he was in that perfect place and you know he was told you must have perfect love to get there right without there without perfect love you cannot get to that great Eternal land so what happens is people get twisted in their mind okay so I've got to receive the Holy Ghost and then I've got to get perfect love and then and then now I need and then now there's also the third pull that's going to be manifested so I've got to get all these three things and then and then and then finally I'm ready right but you see now if you're chasing something that you already have you'll you'll be chasing nothing right but if you realize what you have you can use it right so so this actually becomes a prison where people get in their mind okay I may have the Holy Ghost but now I need perfect love because I want to go to heaven because I love the Lord Jesus but so they're chasing something they already have right so I want to lose this this morning I'm going to realize what's in your hand like Moses asked what's in his hand he says it's just a Shepherd stick and God wanted to tell no you've got more than a Shepherd stick you have what's you already have in your hand what is needed to deliver your people it's the same thing if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll just say the conclusion right now so you know where I'm going if you have the baptism true baptism Holy Ghost you have perfect love that means you're on your way to heaven right and then if you have perfect love you have the baptism the Holy Ghost you have the character of Christ at the third book of manifest in your life and you have the third pull amen so so that's my sermon let's go home praise God all right but I just wanted to but but this can bind people down because I think well and then even even with adoption the adoption robe is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so people think well well I've got the Holy Ghost now I need to get adopted no you're already adopted I won't go into that just now but but see see people start chasing things they already have and then I think well I have no ability to call upon God and God can't work in my life because I need those things but you already have it it's just terminology like your terminology can trap us in our mind but we're free people right now amen so this is just from this he says this is what you preach so so he's beyond the curtain of time he heard a voice there saying now uh then I Heard a Voice in that spoke to me in that room said this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it and I'm more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there is no jealousy there's no tiredness there's no death sickness could never uh could never in their mortality you just could never uh could never make you old that uh they could not cry there was just one Joy so people you know preach you've got to have perfect love you've got to get perfect love to get into heaven and but people have perfect love but you see it can become a house of hell because of a misunderstanding you see so so I'm here to unravel some misunderstandings you may never have these but in case you come across it you'll know actually I've already I'm I'm fully equipped and ready amen so we can't ever think that it takes nothing you know um uh we need to get the Holy Ghost then perfect love no if you have the Holy Ghost you have perfect love because remember God is love right it's not just a feeling that you have that you love everyone it's more than that it's a person God is love amen it says and grieve not the holy spirit of God we're by your seal to the day of your Redemption so if you have the Holy Ghost you seal to the day of your Redemption it's actually as if you're already there because you've got what you need to go there praise the Lord amen that should make us feel real happy right now oh but I've got all these trials in trouble it's fine I've got what I need to get there I mean when trouble is no more I'm gonna be there amen so we can we can rest in that praise the Lord now Hallelujah is Yvonne with me I just want to we're just gonna walk along okay we're going to have a nice just a stroll this morning I just I don't want any misunderstandings I'm here to get rid of misunderstandings amen now we talk a lot we know we have a lot of jargon and one of that is is speaking about the first second and third pull now which which is faces of brother Baron's Ministry now he says here he says now notice of um uh the very day when this measure when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull was healing the second Paul was prophesying the third pull is the opening of the word the the Mysteries revealed no more there no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word remember the third pull was opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word now some people just say well praise God the third pull is just the opening of the word and I know the doctrines so therefore I've got the third pull but remember God's Doctrine comes with power when the word comes open there's a Power released Amen to manifest what has been revealed right so when Martin Luther when it was revealed to the just shall live by faith there was a power of that word that was in the Bible already was released to the people that they could walk live justified by faith they didn't need to say all these novenia prayers and pay for their sins and do these pilgrimages and by these these relics all that nonsense no their faith Justified them so it gave them an overcoming power right because when the word comes open it releases a power just like when the law I could say there was power in the law to give them the promised land one will chase a thousand until Chase ten thousand right because when the word came open on Mount Sinai gave them power to actually dwell in their land and cast out the enemy right so and there's the same thing with sanctification when when where when the second work of Grace was revealed to the church it gave the people power to live a holy life well because when it was already in the scripture when the word came open it releases a power rights is the same thing with the third pull it's more than just see the third pull is not just mentally understanding Doctrine but there's a power in that doctrine that is released to the church that gives them overcoming power in the age they live amen see so it's more than just an understanding there's actually a see all Revelation has a supernatural element right and that Supernatural element must be manifested in our lives see it see sure when the Holy Ghost comes he'll give you an understanding right because you're leading guide you into all truth but it's more than just that a revelation has an outworking right it has an outworking like Peter we no doubt the Christ there's a revelation but it had an outworking what did he say when the 17 all them left he said to whom shall I go you you alone have the words of eternal life so that Revelation and outworking saying this man is more than a Prophet this is Messiah and and even with Peter's failings and all kinds of things he stayed with the Lord why because that Revelation had an outworking sure he had to go to Pentecost he had to really meet that same Lord Jesus had to dwell on him but you see all the Revelation has now working so it's more than just it's more than just a teaching even though these things should be taught right but there's a power in it as if I I just want to labor this because our God is more Supernatural I think we even are aware of and where he is the Supernatural is happening and we want him to be we want to be where he is right so so the third poll is more than just the uh just an understanding of the doctrine see when the word opens that's Christ revealing himself amen so again opening the word there could just be some jug and what is it when Jesus reveals himself it's already here but it has to become revealed amen that's why we don't have a second Bible this is the Bible we have this is our absolute praise the Lord amen so now he begins to speak about the the the manifestations of this third Paul he says now remember it'll never be there'll never be an impersonation of that because it can't be now I'm going to explain this I want to read it then we're going to break this down see it cannot be now it's in existence so so it's here now this power of the spoken word and I have I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happening so it could identify its presence among you see it's not uh it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up and then when it does when that the Pentecostal so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power so he was speaking of when he was saying about this it's an existence it's been identified among us he was speaking about the five times that it was manifested twice twice was the creation of Life which was the which was the speaking the squirrels into existence and brother Bram shot those squirrels ate those squirrels and you know got fit on those screws they weren't a vision he actually literally ate them amen it was the resurrection of Life the fish coming back to life it was the control of nature the storm speak being being spoken out of existence in Colorado amen it was that tumor the size of a grapefruit in the side of his wife being spoken out of existence when he was on the other side of the country and it was the salvation of how he writes two boys amen that's the manifestations of the third pull now I don't need a storm to be spoken out of existence I don't need squirrels to be created right remember all these things that wasn't brother Bram saying I want this right now it was God moving on him and making it happen and when Hetty writes two boys were were saved that was her faith that triggered it it wasn't the prophet that that caused see he's brother Bobby said this wasn't me that did it it's just him that did it through him right but you see now this power is actually in us right now it's in existence it's here right now see people seem to think well the squeeze hasn't come on so it's not going to be here no but it is here there is a squeeze right now we're squeezed out we're not accepted you know we're called a cult that's not a shock to anyone here you know but but like Peter's uh Paul said in the way that's called heresy and in a different translation in the way that's called The Cult I worship the god of my father is believing all the prophets so so he he was called The Cult because he believed all the word it's the same thing with us we're called The Cult why because we believe the whole Bible all right and so now but you see it's identified among us there but you see some people think well brother Brown's got to come back to the power of the spoken word will happen no the same holy ghost that was in him is in the bride so the voice of God brother Ram says is in the bride right so that power is in you and I if you have the Holy Ghost it's in you it's not coming it's already here well we need a squeeze how much squeeze do we need you know it's like the it's like the Jews they didn't they didn't go to sleep one night and they had total Liberty in Europe no trouble and then the next morning they woke up in Auschwitz The Squeeze was a slow progression on their lives political Maneuvers and and persecution oppression and they found themselves in Auschwitz and it's the same thing with us how much squeeze do we need when people always looking off way off in the future for this to happen but I believe it's now it's right here that power is here Among Us it's been identified in this place amen and and um yep you know so so it's here but you say well how do I get this third pool power well it's very simple if you have perfect love if you have the Holy Ghost I'm just going to repeat this if you have the Holy Ghost you have perfect love and if you have the Holy Ghost you have the character of Christ and if you have the character Christ you've got the third pull ey all right amen so now this power the spoken word this is what we read in Mark if ye say to this mountain right so so this very power is in the people but it's very interesting here it says now it says this will not be impersonated see because it takes the character of Christ to have to have the power of the spoken word remember this power is the power of creation it's the one thing the devil cannot do he cannot correct he perverts he can only pervert what God has done what is sin righteousness perverted what is adultery the right act perverted right so sin is righteousness perverted he can't create anything he only can pervert so but and and what he wants more than anything is the power of creation but he cannot get it but God in his great Mercy to to show the devil the power of his salvation takes a fallen people redeems him by the blood fills them with his own spirit and that power of Creation The Devil cannot have he places in your hands in your mouth amen now another thing that people wonder about now I feel like I'm going through this rather quickly but hey if we do that's fine you know people wonder about now how on Earth do other Christians and even non-christians and even witches have the supernatural this can be a prison because people think well if they get the Supernatural and we want the supernatural why do we have to live this kind of life if they get it just living any kind of life and so this can be this can be a real um a real prison because people do not understand that that that it's more than just uh wait well I gotta find no okay it takes a character for the power of the spoken word anything without character is satanic right so it's very important CC people can be even witches have Supernatural but they don't have the character of God right so what is it Satanic sure wrong anointing but even people can have the Holy Ghost anointing but if they don't really know him they're just anointed what it's actually satanic character right so it's not the character of God using it because the power of the spoken word won't be given to anyone that doesn't have the character of Christ because a fallen man ever had that power what kind of chaos would happen right of you know if Elijah you know or no I just won't go yeah but you see you see it's got to be more than just see it takes the character of Christ now I wish my phone was working I've I've made my notes all different this this day so it's all kind of we're going to come back to that now it says in Romans 11 and 29 for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance in other words the gifts and calling a God uh in a person without them even repenting first repentance has got nothing to do with gifts see someone can be their most incredibly gifted singer in all the world but if they haven't repented that gift will still be in them that's why a lot of people like Elvis Presley for example his his daughter just passed away the other day but Elvis Presley he learned his dance moves in the Pentecostal church and the Heart of the Pentecostal Revival he was actually a Pentecostal but he sold his gift to the devil but when when when he did that God didn't take that gift out of his life because it was part of him right so so the gifts and calling of God are without repentance see God will call you without you repenting first he calls you and then you repent right you see so so it's very fun to meet you've got to understand these very gifted people in the world right but but just because but their repentance or no um you know just because they haven't repented does not mean they're not gifted you're born with the gifts that are within you amen if you actually if you're actually gifted to preach you'll always have that gift but then but then instead of a Preacher they'll be a motivational speaker right but that because they give very very charismatic boss or leader politician gifted to speak but it's not repented right that gift has been placed in God's hands someone who who's incredibly gifted at music I use Elvis Presley for an example you know that gift is there that's why people can write incredible songs and make millions and millions of dollars billions of dollars why because of a gift right people that produce music all different kinds of gifts there what but that they are born with that but it's the gifts and calling of God are without repentance Yvonne following me right so people can be gifted they can have gifts of healing they can sing they can do all kinds of things but if there's no real repentance there the gift will still be there because the gift and calling a god are before repentance got nothing to do with repentance that's why there's great artists different gifts God places in the in the world he says and if it be done now listening accepting God's provided away see uh if it would be done out there they'd say the same thing they did when he performed it he's Beelzebub a fortune teller and anybody knows about a fortune teller knows that it's a crazy thing even to say they don't even know the first principle of telepathy or fortune telling that's a work of the devil trying to copy the work of God God chose a prophet the devil has a medium so even mediums that are getting contact with with with Spirits if that gift was surrendered to God God could speak through that gift but because it's not it's not given to God the devil speaks through that gift see why because it's a copy a medium is the devil's copy of a prophet right hey sure there's a lot of bogus mediums that just a cheap trick and just about there's genuine ones there's genuine ones right the two are pretty close together GC it'll be almost fully elected if possible is true we we got lots of impersonation he said as Janice and generous withstood Moses so will these men of cropped Minds reprobate concerning the faith so their Folly will be found out amen so you see people can see see the gift it depends whose hand the gift is in if the gift is surrendered completely to God if that person is surrendered completely God God can use it right but then but then at the same time a gift can actually contact God but that person is not repented they are true like Balaam the Holy Ghost fell upon him and he prophesied but he was a but but his his motive was money his motive wasn't serving God right so and and then and then we'll go into it even you know Judas Iscariot had a Supernatural Ministry and and he he lived in such a way that when Jesus was sitting around the last supper table and said one of you is going to betray me they didn't all say ah it's Judas they actually didn't know who it was so so he wasn't he didn't look like a scoundrel he looked like one of the he looked like a sincere believer but he did not and and and and he had a Supernatural Ministry he cast out Devils right healed the sick did all those things but yet that gift wasn't actually given to God because he didn't go to Pentecost see there's a whole big there's a whole big difference between a gift just being anointed and that person actually God dwelling in them and using it all right so now because of if someone is is completely threw into the Lord then it's the character of God comes out and and we'll come into that so you can be Sanctified without being justified and you can be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without receiving the Holy Ghost that's exactly the disciples in John 17 17 were Sanctified and given power to cast out Devils but still didn't have the Holy Ghost he sure had to go up to Pentecost and wait till the Holy Ghost come that's where Judah showed his colors see see how that Spirit worked its way through justification sanctification but when it come to the end he showed his colors see that's right so you see Judah see so John 17 17 is Jesus praying um Saint Lord sanctify them by Thy Word so they were Sanctified by the word they were justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus this was Judas so justified by faith Sanctified but yet they didn't go to Pentecost and yet the Holy Ghost was working in their lives amen you see see this is this is such a thing that can put Believers in a prison because they can say well these people out there have Supernatural and they do well we're not the only group in the world that has a supernatural this Pentecostal churches there's even Hinduism there's all kinds of different religions that have Supernatural things right but but now what really brings it down to the genuine or the not see because you can be anointed but not sealed in amen see and this is and and and and so so we can't just go by the supernatural of God we have to go by the word of God the character of God I'll go on to that soon see so there's a big difference now between someone who's just anointed and some who's actually been to Pentecost and anointed amen now see now Jesus is very interesting when he sees here now beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are reveling reverending wolves who shall uh know them by ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs or of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a Crabtree Burger forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth uh forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is shown down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them so what is the fruit it's the life it's the character that's the fruit that we're looking for right God is looking for the fruit of the spirit of joy and love and peace long-suffering gentleness kindness all those things right but then so he goes from that now and he continues he says but not everyone that said that I mean Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which isn't which isn't heaven what's the will of the Father the word of God is the will of God men any will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and thy name have cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works and when and then will I Professor them I never knew you'd depart from me ye that work iniquity so he doesn't say no you never did these things he acknowledges actually you do these things you did these things in my name you cast out Devils you prophesied you did many wonderful Works many amazing testimonies your broadcaster was actually my spirit in your life that did it but they didn't know him so that was just anointed but they didn't actually have a true Pentecost where God came and dwelt and they missed the deception of this end time it's just people being anointed without being sealed into the Kingdom right but the reason Jesus says this there after because he's saying buy their fruits you shall know them he's saying now it's more than just Miracles that are the fruit the fruit is the character of Jesus Christ of the word amen so so this can be a prison because people can be so much so misunderstand the word saying well these people out here they dress any way they live any way they do anything they want but yet they have Miracles why do we have to be like this if they get what we want see because it's more than just Supernatural right it's actually the life of God on the inside now amen CeCe it's the see the difference between those see now now the big wait have I got a next one here now you see justification served its times that was the time of Luther remember God was restoring through the reformation and the restoration right so justification serves its time then and justification was under Luther then it had to become sanctification through Wesley and sanctification served its time till it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost served its time till the until the Holy Spirit which there is only one God Blends into the church and the church into Christ and it makes Jesus Christ reflected on the earth what he promised here in the Bible might not believe it I can't make you do that I'm only responsible for the word see that's right so I went from a time under Luther of justification we all know this right amen just shall live by faith but he brought a lot of Catholicism with him because God was restoring it wasn't a full restoration and then God moved on to sanctification they believed in justification but then they believed in living a holy life God Sanctified amen but then they brought a lot of Catholicism with them too because God but God was restoring more then there was a time of restoration of the gifts amen and people thought this is it we've finally arrived but that was just a restoration of the gifts there had to become a time when God was just more than anoint people but were coming and dwell in them because what happened under Pentecost a lot of carnal impersonations there was division there was fighting there was carnality all these things why because it was gorgeous anointing and I hate to say it was the same thing among our ranks as people just get anointed and what happens fussing fighting carnality Kingdom Building Division I'm the biggest preacher and this one's nothing and won't have nothing to do with this person all this stuff what's that the same is under Pentecost in terms of Azusa Street Pentecost but when but but that that served its time now God wants to dwell in his people amen where it's more than just anointing but God comes and dwells in US Hallelujah so now what is the difference now between just a anointing and God dwelling well first is that you the person that has a spirit of God and then we'll be able to receive the whole word of God right so you can look at someone who's having Miracles and you say we've got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if they truly have the spirit of God they'll go amen and they'll receive that if they don't they'll throw it out right and then you know you've got to dress in a Holiness way if they've got the spirit of God they'll surrender to say amen and they'll they'll just walk right into it you know all the all the different parts of the scripture they'll be able to receive why because the spirit of God that wrote the Bible is in the in the believer and it identifies the person in the scripture with the scripture it's not just trying to agree with it see someone who's just anointed we'll try and agree with the word and I'll try and say yes I think that's mean I want to be that but if someone who really has the Holy Ghost something in them says that's me amen that something in them says I you know the scripture I can identify with that something in them says amen and then also you'll see the fruit of the spirit above all things right you'll see love and joy and peace patience long-suffering let's just wait I'll just read it because I'm just quoting it off the top of my head let's go to Galatians 5 and 22. see many people just say well it's receiving the word as a sign of the Holy Ghost but if you really receive the word there'll be an outworking right because a lot of people have received the word but the life has not been changed it's just an argument of fussing fighting and just that's it and that you're bullying from pulpits different things that's not receiving the word see if you really receive the word there's always an outworking of that amen so he says here and and Galatians 5 and 22 but the fruit of the spirit Remember by their fruits you shall know them is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law amen so you see now but you see these things in in in any life it just grows a sheep Bear's wool it doesn't have to force itself it doesn't put pressure on itself it just eats and grows wool an apple tree it just happens to grow apples it doesn't try and say okay you know they don't have a stand-up meeting every morning The Orchards okay boy we've got to grow some Bray Burns we're going to have some Braeburn apples no at the life of the Brae Boone apples in the tree it'll produce it it can't help it just like any Citrus it will produce if it's orange tree it'll produce oranges amen it will produce the life that's in the original part of the tree in the tree itself it's the same thing with you and I it's not us trying to be can we what happened you know you're not trying to have love you have love you're not trying to have joy you have joy you're not trying to have a piece of pasta all understanding you have it you're not trying to be long-suffering well I've got to be because the Bible says no you just are you're not trying to be gentle you just are I I mean not trying to have goodness or faith you know Temperance meekness it just lives out of you you can't help it why because the one that wrote this is in you manifesting it amen see that's a big difference between just being anointed if you've got a temper that that you can fight a bus or you've got to meet God there's something in you that's not right amen that you always fly off the handle you can't put up with any any kind of opposition trouble you just flare up no we should be making gentle quiet because God you say well I wasn't born that way none of us were born this way right some people might have a character that's close but they won't have the full thing because it needs a new birth to Manifest this I mean no one is born with this whole character it takes the Holy Ghost to give us a new birth Amen to give us a nature change which is the nature of God amen you'll find yourself automatically living out the word if you have him dwelling in you amen because it says in Ezekiel 36 and 27 I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my judgments and you shall keep my statutes and do them amen so it's actually his Spirit within us will cause us to walk in his word it's not us trying to do it remember Christianity is not you and I trying to be the Christian it's him in us being the Christian amen that's how we are real Christians when he is on the inside of us amen does everyone everyone with me so far amen it's so vitally important that we that we look into these things and we remember it's actually God it takes to have the character of God we must have his holy ghost amen so it's more than just being anointed but it's God dwelling in you by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that gives you the character of God that is what you must have now where are we amen now but the thing is if you take out any part of this restoration it becomes satanic because the devil can jump in in that point and that's what's happened among our ranks is that people they they'll say absolutely we believe in justification never did it in the first place erupts praise God and in the mind of God inevited in the first place he saw your redeem shouting and we'll say amen and then we believe in sanctification to the nth degree remember sanctification is not you this is not a Methodist sanctification where it's a myth a human method to living a holy life no the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies us right by one offering we are Sanctified perfected forever he's perfected forever them that are Sanctified right so he sanctifies our life you see something in your life that's that's not of God and it troubles you say Lord cleanse me of it because remember sanctification is not a one and done it's a constant sanctification of God taking things out of our life hallelujah amen so but you're gonna let him sanctify you and he does praise God but then uh so so people will cabbage down on those ideas and I say but the third pull is just the opening of the word in other words we just need to have the perfect understanding then that's all we need and what do they do they leave off the manifestation of the Holy Ghost remember you leave off any of this is when the devil can jump in and it becomes a satanic thing so so churches will stop the moving of the Holy Ghost they say it's too Pentecostal but if God restores he never takes away that which he has restored right we still believe in justification we don't throw it away because we've moved on justification comes with us we believe in sanctification right we don't throw it away just because we know we say we're up in the bright age we're the full restoration of the word is no all of that is part of you and I why because God is restoring he's taking us back to the original the original faith of the fathers you see so now now people in the message they may love justification sanctification but they'll throw away the gifts of the Spirit they'll and the anointing they'll say it's just two Pentecostal we don't need that I say we need it it's all part of him I want all of him amen so you know and the gifts are actually in the body to keep the body clean to keep sin out praise the Lord and people throw the anointing away saying we don't need moves of the Holy Ghost in our church we don't need cries of joy and crying and shouting and all that stuff we don't need that kind of because we've matured now I find it very interesting David was King he was adopted he was in his position of the king and he danced before the ark so here was an adopted son of God dancing he wasn't you know immature little Shepherd boy dancing around a tree no he was the king of Israel and and he was dancing before God but people say we don't need that kind of carry on here but yeah and then what happens is they throw away the moving of the Holy Ghost where God cannot move in a church and and and that means the atmosphere is not right to cause Eagles to hatch to be born Eamon because remember atmosphere is everything we must have the right kind of atmosphere that's why we must be very careful we don't we don't push the atmosphere away because remember our God is like a dove he don't put up with nothing you know if something offends him he flies away he doesn't clown he doesn't just you know so we're going to be very careful when we worship and praise God we don't knock the anointing out of this place but remember if you're fully surrendered to God you won't knock the anointing out so you know if you're fully surrendered to God and God dwells in you and he leads you to dance he's not going to be offended he's going to join you in the dance you begin to cry he's going to cry with you amen if you want to shout he's going to shout with you right because it's him doing it if it's him doing it it's never out of church order but you see we must never ever get to a point where we say we don't need those things well that was years ago when the church was young now the church is still young we're always going to be young right well it's going to be green and flexible Right Moving in the Wind of the Holy Ghost because remember The Greener of plant is the more light it can absorb and the more it can grow amen I don't believe I'm looking at a bunch of dead wood Hallelujah but we're green trees hallelujah amen we don't ever want to get too stayed in our ways that God can't move our hearts and touch Our Lives amen but you see people will throw away the moving of the Holy Ghost oh we don't need tongues that's just Pentecostal no it's part of the truth why throw away part of the truth like Luther Luther you know smoked a pipe drank beer believed in the Trinity didn't even baptize even nearly right hated the Jews does that mean we throw away justification no it's part of the truth so we take that remember truth was being restored there's a lot of humanity there that had to go away but the life was growing Weasley you know this you're this legalistic you know man-made method of of sanctification but sanctification is part of the word do we throw away everything that that was the humanity part of that move no we keep the truth that grows through the restoration of the gifts you know do we throw that away because of of what Pentecost does and did no it's part of the word it's a restaurant there's a lot of humanity there but now brother Ryan says now we've come to the end now where the where the seed has come back again the grain is here again right now now some people will say and this is another cage well it's just the grain there's not a big movement you know there's not a lot of movement now because now we're just laying in the presence of the sun like we're a bunch of you know just a bunch of seeds that just lay there on a table like this we're going to go back to the first green what did he do what did the first what did the original grain do it casts out Devils he praised he shouted amen he healed the sick he raised the dead he was led by Vision led by the Holy Ghost manifesting the word of God for his life that was the original and if that was the original then the end which is the same grain again will do the same Works amen the same life will be manifested it won't be a different one it won't just be some people trying to absorb teaching like this is some learning lecture hall God forbid it ever come just to that remember teaching can be anointed too every gift guide anoints it doesn't matter exactly how you know a preacher maybe I remember brother Johnny demoff in our first Camp he just stood there and taught man every word was like boom and I just wanted to scream and shout everything he said it was so powerful but yet it didn't look so Dynamic but it was the Holy Ghost working see so you can never judge the the effect of the meeting by how exuberant it is it's what is the word doing what is God doing to the heart right because sometimes you know surgery can be pretty look pretty rough sometimes it's a little Keyhole thing a little cut little hair you know it can be seen so well that wasn't such a big deal but actually it was a big deal right so we can't ever judge the powerfulness if that's a word of the meeting by how exuberant everything is that's when God comes and anoints the gifts see and anoints us and changes our hearts but you see if the original grain did those kind of things I'm expecting you and I to do those same kind of things that's what he did and we want to be like Jesus right we're not a bunch of theologians sitting around just discussing quotes and just arguing in different things and sword fighting no no no God wants to come and live in our lives Hallelujah but we never want to throw any of the word away otherwise what the character of God cannot live in US I mean we want to see Eagles hatch now we want to we need to go back here because I had this all different kind of ways now now why does he stand by he's talking about suffering the reason is in Romans 8 17 and 18. and if children then ears ears of God join ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with them that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with them we cannot reign with them you must suffer to Reign the reason of this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory and not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule so someone who does not have the character of Christ what is that that's power without character remember people can have a real good character that's very close to the character of God that can be me they can be gentle they can be loving long-suffering patient all those things but without the new birth it's just human ability they can just have that kind of temperance right but you see it takes a new birth to give us this kind of character we see so power without character is satanic why because the devil can get in there and work and that's why we need the character of Christ for the third pull to operate but if you have the Holy Ghost you have the character of Christ don't put it off in the future somewhere if you truly have the Holy Ghost you have the character of Christ amen hallelujah well then well then why do we go through why is it why is it you know you know we get character through suffering it's because in times of trial the real you comes out it's not in the good times it's in the hard times that's when pressure comes on like if you get a lemon you squeeze the lemon what's in the lemon comes out lemon juice the life and the lemon comes out anything you know it's like um but but the life's got to be in there to get it just like you know there's a saying you can't get blood from a tournament because there's no blood there you can squeeze a turnip all you want no blood's coming out right so the same thing with you and I pressure comes on to reveal what's within us amen so really if you really want to see what you're really made of be a bit sleep deprived have a little pressure and what's really within you will come out now praise God Hallelujah now the thing is if your Humanity comes out you've got to surrender that to God right because remember brother Brahm says when the Holy Ghost comes and it's like the size of a button and then it pushes out because why you begin to grow mature there's a character of Christ but it's got to grow right that's why you know the Apostle Paul would say in um Ephesians 4 we've got to grow into the fullness of the Statue of Christ where it talks about the um talks about the Perfection of the Saints it's not saying about a sinless Perfection because the blood makes us sinlessly perfect right but that Perfection means a maturity a completion we're going to grow we start as newborn babes Desiring the milk of the word then we're going to meet what because we grow it's like every every adult eats well probably not anymore actually but it used to be eat solid food right there goes a time when they go from milk they begin to eat solid food because they grow right there's a time when you have little babies I remember Lilia did this especially we're eating next to each other how how many months old and she looked at us like can I have some of that you know she had this look in her eyes what was happening she was growing to a stage where where the bottle wasn't satisfying her enough anymore she needed some solid food why because life was there amen it's the same thing with us as we begin to mature we want we go from the milk of the word to the meat why because we're growing but the thing is now as the Holy Ghost comes in like the size of button pushes out you've got to be willing when trouble comes in to surrender any right to be bitter to surrender the right to hold a misunderstanding because it's got to push out it's got to push those things you can't have both in you at the same time well you're going to be willing for it to take over the complexes in your life right we can never justify anything that keeps us in a prison why do you just why do you act that way around that person well a million years ago they did this to me they didn't shake my hand therefore I'm not talking to them oh I'm just not part of this group no that's a complex right that's a prison but God wants to lose us from those kind of Prisons amen that we can walk with him and be real Believers amen so now we're going to let him take those things out of our life so suffering happens because what's on the inside of us comes out so if the Holy Ghost is in you it will cause you to go to the Lord in prayer and will cause you to surrender more to him and be more sincere and be more yielded right so the more sincere and yielded you come to the more of him and less of you will come out who wants more of him to come out amen when you squeeze me just you know or squeeze us it's just the Holy Ghost comes out it's his character his nature how he would respond comes out that's the most important thing amen so so this is how we must be that's why Trouble Comes and suffering comes remember it's through Great Tribulation we enter into the kingdom of God this is not a Sunday school picnic this is a battlefield right you've signed up for a war I don't realize you've enlisted but you've enlisted right trouble really strikes when you start walking with God right because why because you must you must suffer Terrain there's a measure of suffering left for you and I it's through Great Tribulation right God is all-powerful but he allows us to go through things why that his character will come to the Forefront not our character but his character will come out Amen to the Holy Ghost will take over our lives more and more that's why when a trial comes to you say well that brother or sister did something to me it's not actually about that it's what's in you and your response right that's the thing that God wants to deal with I mean that's why Jesus would say you know when you go and try and take the moat out of your brothers I actually take the beam out of your own eye first because a complex or a prison will make you look a certain way at things I'm not looking anyone particular but you look through tinted glasses you're only about see-through bars only only some of the way you know but you see now that's why God allows things to happen it's like Lord examine my life take those things out of me Lord that's not my Humanity or not my complex or not my culture or whatever that's responding it's actually you responding out of me praise God and you're glad that we're his workmanship Hallelujah why because he wants us a character is a victory not a gift that means there's got to be a battle to get it right a victory is not given to you on a civil Planet saying here it is no there's a fight and what is that fight to deny yourself take up your cross and follow him resting because Christianity is a walk of self-denial right it's a walk of actually forfeiting all your rights to hold anything against anyone it's a victory because your flesh our flesh doesn't want to our flesh is used to holding grudges it's been the human spirit is very good at holding grudges it's been doing it since Adam right and it's been passed all the way down but there has to be a time when that cycle is broken right and this is because this is a season of restoration this is the hour where that cycle you may have family traits you know I know I know in English you know people's last names used to be their um occupation like Baker and Smith and whatever more you know but really if you know if our last names were honest it would be like anger or malice or stubbornness or Strife or argumentative or you know lust or drunkenness or revelry or whatever that would be a lot of our last names of our family line but there has to come a time when that name has changed right that that we're no longer living our last name out if it's those kind of things right now I'm not saying you're gonna go change your last name whatever your last name is praise God you know hallelujah it's interesting to know where you came from naturally but I'd rather know where I'm from spiritually right but you know but but what I'm saying is our natural lineage should not dictate to us how we treat one another how we walk in this world it may have been our forebeest problem but now there comes a time when it's done right and God wants to break all those things out of our life why that his character can come forth and that's why he allows suffering to come into our lives because he wants to put a finger on something and say hold on I want to get that out of you but the only way I can get it out of you is if you give it to me remember he's not a bully he doesn't mug us mug us of our bitterness and strife and unforgiveness and whatever he doesn't just beat us down and pull it out of us now he's a gentleman we have to say Lord get this out of my life he said was I've been praying about this for a long time he he'll take it from you Hallelujah don't just give up right keep pressing and say Lord make me more like thee Hallelujah praise the Lord amen sit down it's a character is a victory it's not a gift amen but Power with characters fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis as that he overcame and sat down in his father's Throne so we have to overcome and sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation see are you willing He's Able are you willing Hallelujah I'm willing Lord take me through whatever you need whatever you need to do oh I'm willing because you have my best interest in mind Hallelujah praise the Lord amen right we've got a Hallelujah amen that's what I put this up because I know people will watch us and say but it's receiving the word as the evidence of the Holy Ghost yeah but then look if people got the word then the works would follow that's the Bible I'm just reading the last phrase there but you see because it's more than just a mental receiver it's actually it's when the word is received the Holy Ghost comes in and then begins to live out praise the Lord amen but are you willing to we'll leave that for another day amen but I'm saying we'll go back to that sorry there's a bit of a segue but are you willing to let him take you through much tribulation I'm just going to leave it there I think it's a good place to stop but now now class remember if you have the Holy Ghost you have perfect love right if you have the Holy Ghost you have the character of Christ right if you have the Holy Ghost then you have the third pull in you right it won't be impersonated because it's more than just a gift it's got himself stepping and speaking the word of creation it's more than just a gift right and we need the character because if we don't have the character then we won't have that living in us right you're gonna have the character and the gifts together amen otherwise it's satanic because the devil can get in there and use an unrepentant gift for his own purposes all right so that's my conclusion but I trust I don't know if anyone's been going through this battle of well I need to get these things and you know but no if you truly have the Holy Ghost if his character is in you you can receive the whole word the spirit on you Bears witness with his that you're a Son of God you you cannot it identifies you in the scripture something in you says Amen to every word you see the fruit of the spirit I mean your Nature's being changed that the word lives automatically out of your life what's happened you've really met him more than just an anointing at a camp sometime which is praise the lord we love that we need it we need God to move and and and have an atmosphere every service Where Eagles can be born right Hearts can be mended we need that but it's more than just being anointed but God comes and dwells in you if you have that you're ready for the third poll right and it's here right it's been identified Among Us it's here right now don't put it off in the future that's here right now I don't need a storm spoken out of existence I don't need squirrels to be created I don't need those things but I need my family in I need it that Lord you can bypass this and speak to someone's life that they can actually meet him right Hallelujah amen so let's just have the musicians this morning we're just gonna
