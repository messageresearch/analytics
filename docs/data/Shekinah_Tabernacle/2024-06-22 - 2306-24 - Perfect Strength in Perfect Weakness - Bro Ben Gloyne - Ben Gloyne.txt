Amen praise the Lord and sister laaba is on her way to amen amen let's um let's turn to the scripture this morning we going to go to 2 Corinthians uh we're going to read uh from chapter 1 then also we're going to flip over to chapter chapter um three so second Corinthians 1 I like how things work you know I was reading through uh perfect strength and perfect weakness then my then Christine sent me a scripture and yeah I thought it was quite neat how it all tied together so we're just going down amen this is where we're going amen soor I don't have a slideshow today so you got to do the leg work amen open some open some Bibles amen so 2 Corinthians uh chapter 1 vers 8 to10 then we're going to read from 2 Corinthians 3: 1-6 it says here uh for we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trouble that has come to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life but we uh but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raiseth the Dead who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet Deliver us we're going to have trouble on this road it's going to be overwhelming at times but our God's able amen Our God's more than able amen amen second Corinthians then we go to chapter 3: 1-6 this is one of my favorite uh piece of scripture at the moment this bit here I mean I love second Corinthians but this one Do We Begin Again to Comm commend ourselves or need we as some other others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you for ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men and uh for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves this is this is my favorite scripture right here right now not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God Amen I like that don't you amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen let's let's commit our lives in into the hands of our maker gracious Lord Jesus thank you so much Lord we can commit Our Lives into your hands thank you Lord that our sufficiency comes from you our ability comes from you dear God and Father as we bow our heads we want to commit Our Lives commit all that we are into your hands father that you would be magnified you'd be glorified in this service father you'd have your way dear God and we lord just want to add my prayers for brother Phil as well father seeing him yesterday Lord he's in a lot of pain I just pray that you'll continue to uh heal them Lord be with them and sister blinda during this during this trial reveal yourself to them I pray through this For Your Glory we commit them into your hands Lord may you inspire the medical staff there at the hospital the doctors nurses Lord with the best treatment for Him Father father we commit him into your hands Lord asking you touch his body and raise him up for your glory and dear God as we are here today I pray that you'll just Lord we just want to get ourselves out of the way Lord Jesus and we want you to take over so may you take over speaker and hearer those who are streaming those who are sick and body who are not here be their portion Lord in Jesus Christ's name have your way amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning so I want to speak about uh perfect strength and perfect weakness now I really was thinking about this uh uh for a while and I really should just uh call all my sermons for the last year uh the second fold uh uh the second phase of God's three-fold purpose part 65 now you may not make any sense to that but brother Bram says in Christ is a mystery of God revealed because I think some people get in their mind I'm not saying here but people somehow think you got to throw out a lot of message terminology for it to be a message sermon right no you don't I've been preaching the seventh seal the whole time we've been here right I may not use the phraseology but I just pray see this message needs to go from Theory and concept to reality it's got to be appliable it's got to be where the rubber hits the road you know where that gravel and the rubber meat that's where it's got to be amen so so this is why maybe maybe some people I don't know I just think maybe some people think maybe I'm not messy enough well I think I'm pretty messy amen buzzword don't bring the Holy Ghost the reality of the word brings the Holy Ghost amen that's why we need him so brother Bram says this in Christ your mystery of God revealed now what is the whole three-fold purpose was see to express himself he wants to become see the world is lost now he has to express himself in a man to become a savior through the reconciliation of the blood from his cross now he had to become that to die in order to save and to bring himself back into a church to have the preeminence in his church that's the second fold phase to the Christ mystery of God revealed right so what I've been preaching on is that Christ would have preeminence in us right so so it's not malice Strife unbelief carnality Pride nothing human has preeminence in our lives but he does that's what we need amen if we want to see God live in power we need him to have preeminence amen because this is not we are not a one man one person denomination doing what we want no we want him to be our head amen he's our King amen he's not a rejected King in our lives he is the accepted loved adored worship King amen so now the Apostle Paul he says he say his sufficiency he would not trust uh he see not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God now it's amazing when you think about this where the Apostle Paul if there was any man that had ability in himself it was him he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees I mean he he was raised up on the Bible on the on the what we call the Old Testament you know he is a very smart man very astute man he knew a lot of different languages he you know so you think man this guy is sufficient he's got the ability but God could use none of those things in order to to to bring Salvation to the Gentiles and there's one thing I just want to try and get across this morning is that when we think we can do it God can't do it you know I know I've used this um saying quite a few times and I think I haven't said in a long time but I used to say you know this is not my first rodeo you know and to a sense that's true but when we get to a point where we're trusting in our in in our experience above the god that gave the experience then that's a dangerous thing you know when we get to a place where we where we think well we know what we're doing then God can't do what he needs to do amen we must always perfectly depend upon the Lord that for him to fulfill his word sure we can look back and we can have confidence that the god that found us and saved us and did everything he did in the past will still live today cuz he's the same yesterday today and forever but when we think we know what we're doing his hands are tied right but if we stay completely surrendered sold out trusting and relying on his ability then that's where he can step on the scene now that's basically my sermon we could go home now but I just want to go through it a bit because I just really remember this is this is an age there's never been an age like this age where man can rely and depend upon his own ability what's the answer to every question I know Google will know right how long did that take to come through a couple of milliseconds and this is how many results you know man trust in their ability to find the Answer Man trust in their ability to work out the answer look at this this age we live in you know how do we get to the moon how do we fix the planet how do we do this people Trust on their own ability amen but the bride of Christ is not here we're not here to trust in our own abil abity we had to trust in God's ability cuz remember the ability of our God is unlimited what he can do amen he can there's no limit to our god there's nothing that he cannot achieve amen if he made the body you live in he made this planet that you walk on he made the food that you eat amen he made the materials that man has taken and made this made these clothes made this structure made you know he made everything just like the Bible said he made the Sun and the Moon he made the Stars also just as a like an offhand comment yeah he made all that I made all that by the way you know I think we can trust in this guy the Lord Jesus yeah yeah I think we can trust in God to to direct our paths and to work out every situation you see see it's the devil's it's it's an attribute of Satan to do it your own way you know I was um you know you know as you know I'm at work and you it's an it's an open plan lab and the and the radio was going and Frank Sinatra song was playing I did it my way and I thought if there ever was a uh the devil's testimony was that one that song I did it my way and the devil wants that attitude to be in US of course wrapped up in in religion in the message right but he but but that's the devil he said I did it my way he wasn't content with how God made him he wasn't happy with the POs he had the greatest position in all the Angels right he wasn't just a little lower angel I don't know what they called exactly he was the he was the top guy you know even you know the um you know even brother Brown would say that that that that that God made Satan basically just like him but he couldn't create of course limied his understanding all these things but he was basically Made In His Image in a way he was that powerful but yet couldn't create but so the devil got in his mind I'm going to do things my way and then he injected that through into the human race but you see we are not called to live in that way at at all amen but but our Our Song should be I did it his way amen I did it the word's way amen now if you don't you if you like that song have not tring on any toes I was thought man that's um what a testimony of the devil I did it my way I had it my way no I don't want it my way my way ends up in wreckage my my way ends up in ruin my my way ends up in a very bad place his way ends up in glory amen so I think I'll take that way amen Hallelujah so so this word sufficiency means ability amen so he said his sufficiency wasn't of of of himself but his ability or sufficiency was of God now brother Braham says this in perfect strength and by Perfect weakness because remember I think we've got to a place because it's uh I think it was uh they said this this year or this week was the 60th anniversary when the Beatles came to Wellington 1964 they came to Wellington I think the same time that may have been a different tour they they went to Australia and they said that that tour changed the face of Australia one tour one band four boy four men whatever coming singing some concerts changed the whole face of Australia socially was isolated more conservative then they came in an anointing was released and look at the place they have now right I say the same thing with New Zealand see so and then you take it on the flip side with the message is that it's been here over 60 years we have become accustomed to looking at quotes and scriptures and putting things together and having church and you know it's become a routine but in that routine human strength can come up well I know the answer I can find the answer I can I can get this quote and put this together and I trust you're following me today amen you know people in their own strength can put the word together and put a case forward even Even in our own strength stren you know you can put a sermon together you can search a key word boom boom boom here you go an hour later you walk out but is that is that God's strength or is that the man's strength right is it is it the weakness of the man saying Lord Lord I need there's food for us today Lord there's something for us spiritually you know is it that or is it my human strength delivering the word is it our human strength leading our families is it our human strength raising our children or is it God's strength you can't have both operating at the same time brother R says this now he says the case of it is is that is not that we are too weak the case is we're too strong we're just too strong that's all the thing of it is we're too strong headed that's right we're too strong in our head we know too much God wants to get that out of us that's right we're too strong we're too strong to yield to him amen we we yield to ourselves amen we've got to think well now I got sense enough to know so you say so we yield to something we either yield to God or we yield to ourselves I'd rather yield to him amen well how do you yield to yourself yield to your own understanding yield to your own feelings yield to your own makeup well I'm just made this way so I'm going to go this way no no no that's that's yielding to yourself you're surrendering to your own will and that will is a rubbish will by the way that's a that's a bogus GPS it takes you it says you're on the pathway up some Mountain somewhere or in the valley somewhere you're you're totally off the course right but if we can if if we can lay aside our own strength and yield to his strength amen then then God can step in and do the miraculous God can do what he needs to do amen so you know the Apostle Paul you think about this man he was strong he was intelligent he was more than able to do the job see his sufficiency changed when he met the Lord on the road to Damascus and he stayed in that state all the days of his life see see God had to break a cycle of Revival and death and he broke it in the Apostle Paul's life he proved that it's not a onetime thing where you where you just meet the Lord then you go on fire then you cool off and no God continually lit the flame in his life he died daily that sent sentence of death in himself he was dead to self that God would deliver amen because he had sufficient he knew his sufficiency was of the Lord so he knew everything he did my ability is not my own ability now he would he would he would you got to think about this man The Incredible the Incredible thing that God did see Paul or Saul sufficiency or ability before he met the Lord was his own intellect how smart he was it was how much he memorized the scripture I believe he probably could have he quoted it from Genesis to Malachi that's all they had at that time he could have quoted that word for word it would have been completely right all that's fine right but but he would have been depending upon that he would have been depending upon his own interpretation of the scripture instead of asking instead of asking the author of the scripture to come interpret it to him he is asking the rabbi to interpret it to him he's asking Gia some some some some learned man as opposed to letting the author of the scripture himself come and interpret it to him that's why it's so important see we got to realize that the scripture is not of any private interpretation but God moved on men of old and gave the script so so so so the answer is some people say well it's not of any private interpretation then how can you say that brother Braham has the right interpretation but the next scripture answers it said it's not man's private interpretation that they work it out but God moved on holy men of all moved on prophets and gave the interpretation right so it's not we're not following an a private interpretation of the scripture we're following God's interpretation of his word revealed through a prophet amen so it's not us trying to depend on our own human ability to have the right interpretation no it's God's interpretation of the word because God's interpretation of the word produces what God said it will produce amen if the Bible says repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that happens amen we're living evidence that it works amen so that's how we know God's interpretation is right or that interpretation is right because God produces what it says it'll produce amen but you see so see his human Drive is what he thought was uh he was um you know made him sufficient his ambition his reasoning his obtaining a letter from the high priest all these things he thought this was this was his sufficiency look I've got this standing among people he cared about what the Pharisees thought of him amen he you know he was he was all the he thought this was his ability was from all those things all of it was completely 100% against God all these things he relied on this was his identity well I know the scripture I'm a Pharisee the Pharisees I got to drive I want to I want to serve God in this system I want to be the best I can be and you know all those things I've got this letter from the high priest I've got Authority from an Earthly system but you see when he met the Lord on the road to Damascus all that strength became nothing I mean when he realized his own real condition everything he relied on was completely wrong imagine being in that position everything you've you've you've you've worked for achieved thought of sacrificed for you're completely wrong but you see God needs us to get to that position he wants us to come to that realization that everything we are what we think we are in terms of our own ability it doesn't get us anywhere are we together this morning amen see this is see it's not see his sufficiency changed from his own self and what people thought of him to God himself amen his his so his ability or his sufficiency came from only Earthly things but then it changed that it only came from God himself so he didn't rely on everything he used to rely on he didn't rely on anymore he didn't rely on his upbringing anymore he didn't rely on his family name anymore didn't rely on his his his lineage any of those things I've been raised you know my you know my girls oh and William now I can say that now you my children are fourth generation message believers they can't rely on that that is the wrong kind of sufficiency no they're suff iy has to be the Lord see God don't have grandchildren God has sons and daughters that are birthed by him amen so so it requires not just leaning on well this is my family this is my parents this is my church what you know all those things no our sufficiency has to come from the Lord amen because if we're trusting only in him then he can come on the scene you see so the Apostle Paul he became perfectly weak but then he became perfectly strong when he became perfectly weak see when he was strong in himself he had nothing with God but then when he became perfectly weak and realized his failure of his human ability now when he realized this he didn't wallow in a pity party see some people they hear perfect strength perfect weakness and they say I'm no good I can't amount to nothing and you know poor me and I've got no abilities and I got nothing I can give to God and they wallow in it and it's Pride actually coming out it's Pride that comes out and says well well I'm useless I've got no ability you know well Jesus says without me I can do nothing so I can do nothing and you know it's unbelief speaking but God God doesn't want us to speak like that see pride looks at self pride looks at own ability the Apostle Paul was a very proud man he would have had a Persona had a reputation yes I'm this oh here comes the great Minister into the town the great Pharisee of the Pharisees and you know he he would have been a very proud man but then when he met the Lord all that Pride was burnt out of him completely amen all of that all of that ability and what he thought of himself he said I count all things but D that I may win Christ he says he says do we have confidence I'll just read this from Philippians 3 he says for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh amen though I might also have confidence in In the Flesh If any man thinketh that he ought a ha thereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more I love it how God gives someone a testimony that can destroy everyone else's argument can destroy all the pride and whatever people thinking see God would take someone like the Apostle Paul and say look I've been in your shoes I don't trust in what you think you should be trusting in no what you're trusting in is completely wrong I used to trust in it but I've got a better way cuz God has shown me a higher way amen but he could relate to them saying look don't trust in those things and I'm going to tell you why that that you think humanly I should trust in them more than you because I was circumcised on the eighth day I'm from Israel I'm an Israelite I'm The Tribe of Benjamin I know where I'm from I'm a Hebrew of the Hebrews I'm not a lukewarm Hebrew I'm a real zealous Hebrew I'm a real genuine as touching the law a Pharisee I do more than what's expected of me remember they added a bunch of laws and regulations to the law right human laws he says I'm a Pharisee basically if you saw him you say man this guy is real devout but inwardly he was dead see he was trusting in his own self his own ambition people can be humanly good message Believers for a long time in their own drive and own ambition but that'll come to an end it has to come to an end because God wants to prove it ain't your ability you just be going around in a cycle of inward frustration and you know just a grinding out and these things but when God comes and brings you Liberty from that then you can Rejoice then it's no longer a burden it's a joy to serve the Lord It's a joy to be a believer if people you know the world says you can't do those things thank God I'm not in that sewage pipe of the world I'm free I've been cleansed see to be Sanctified is is is to be cleansed from one thing but it's been to to be Sanctified to another am mean so we're not just Sanctified from the world people oh from no no I've been separated to God Amen if I been separated to God then God can live in my life then everything that he gives me which is not perverted and he doesn't give anything perverted gives a lasting satisfaction and joy amen it doesn't give you an empty promise that just makes you angry and empty on the inside no it gives you a promise that is full is what it is amen see the joy of the Lord is not empty praise God the joy of the law is not frustrating amen it's not something that's just a a you a carrot that keeps moving on a stick and you're running after it no he gives you what he wants to give you and then you can have your cake and eat it too I like cake I'm a sweet too so I like that kind of thing amen you praise L yeah so he's saying look I can't he says so I'm a Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless this is how he was but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ yet doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ so he's saying look all those things that I trusted in that's dung on the field boys don't rely on those things don't rely on your lineage where your from your mom and dad no your sufficiency must go from those things to the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen that our ability is not in ourselves it's in him it's not in we know it's in him it's not the church we go to it's in him right amen because all human things come to an end but God God is Unlimited in what he can do Hallelujah so he said his sufficiency is of the Lord now notice this in our in our opening scripture where he said that they were you know you know saying that don't you I don't want you to be ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia you see when we're perfectly weak then we become perfectly strong but then that doesn't mean there's an absence of trouble and it doesn't mean it won't affect us right amen so he says we're pressed pressed out of measure above strength in so much so we despaired even of life amen so he came to a point this this trouble he came was a great trouble it was an overwhelming trouble amen it was above his strength it was you even despair that they are alive that's how vexing and heavy it became but he did not he did not allow that to cause him to rely on his own ability you see when Trouble Comes The Devil's trying to ward off a blessing coming to you right you you read through the scripture there's a trial but then there's always a blessing after the trial amen Abraham had a trial of Faith 25 years but he got the blessing Hallelujah Isaac came he was born amen that you know so you see there's many troubles like that down through the Bible but you got to realize there's always Sunshine after a storm right you may well the storm's going for a long time but there's Sunshine after it don't quit in the trouble don't quit in the trouble you see when we really sell out to the Lord when we really give our lives to him we don't get upset when Trouble Comes and throw our toys out of the cot right Jesus knew the pain and anguish he would suffer on Calvary right he never because he fully surrendered in in the garden then whatever would come to him after that it couldn't change his mind amen it couldn't change his mind because he said no Lord not my not my will but thy will be done see he was perfectly strong perfect strength and perfect weakness he became perfectly weak that the strength of God could flow through his life that he could fulfill the word allotted to him you see we love to talk about you know that we' know in the power of his resurrection but what about the fellowship of of his sufferings it's the same scripture you see you've got to have it hand in hand brother brah said that there you even Jesus would you know would be asked by the sons of thunder or the mother of the sons of thunder because mothers want the best things for their sons and their children and you know she came to Jesus and said you know can my son sit on your left and right hand in the kingdom and and you know Jesus said no it's not you know it's not given you know I can't give it to them you know it's for those who overcome basically so there's a position there's a place that the Overcomer sits with him right but then but then he asked him can you drink of the cup that I'll drink can you be baptized with the baptism I have received they said yes so that cup that he received was a cup of suffering so there's a measure of suffering that would be placed upon the church as well Amen brother BR even said that a church that ain't ain't ain't struggling don't have it hallelujah praise God amen amen that means if we got trouble we got it amen and the Apostle Paul after that Damascus Road experience he just had trouble but if you could ask him was it worth it he'd say every day was worth it every stripe was worth it cuz I was perfectly weak and his strength was made perfect in my weakness because all I desired growing up was to see this God that lived amen and God had to take me out of what I thought I knew about him into what I into who he really was and every day he began to prove himself even when I was chained to a Roman soldier I was I was in a boat in a storm I was running for my life trouble would you know start having church and the mob would come up and Scatter the church and cause trouble it was all worth it because his desire and that's every believer's desire is that God would live they don't want to live they're not they they just want to see him live am mean that that's what I want to see is to see his word live in trouble and good times you know we're not as I've said before many times you know the right condition to be in for God to live is not to have your nice quiet instrumental worship music playing and your favorite cup of coffee and your favorite View and no no it's it's faith in the word causes God to live it's not about the circumstances you're in it's not the trouble you're going through the Apostle Paul was in a storm which would have probably been worse than the cook straight when the you know when the fairies are closed all those things in this little boat I remember seeing when I was young cuz I love sailing and Pirates and you know all those things and ships and you know seeing the replica of the Endeavor coming to gizon Harbor I look at this thing this little bottle stopper and they sailed around the world in this little thing it's not big it's quite underwhelming to be fair it's quite underwhelming this thing but you see the Apostle Paul he would have been on a smaller ship than that and yet he's going up and down in the storm 14 days that's a long storm that's a long that's a long time to feel the your sear up and now I don't know if he seasick or not he didn't record it it didn't obviously that wasn't a thing that needed mentioning maybe if for argument sake he was but yet he didn't let his conditions am trouble him I'm going to Rome that that was him I'm going to Rome the angel of the Lord told me I'm going to Rome amen so it doesn't matter what comes I'm going to stay perfectly weak that the Lord can reveal and manifest that word in my life and we got to realize we're going to heaven yes sir as the angel of the Lord told you through the message you're going to glory amen so you'll go through storms you'll go through trouble you go through hardship you go through re rejection you go through all kinds of things you go through misunderstandings and God won't necessarily give you the answer I was reading John I think it's amazing the resurrection happens Peter is Peter is seen where the disciples are gone fishing discouraged you know and Peter sees the Lord on the Shore Bank he jumps in he swims to him all those things happen you know Peter's asked by Jesus three times do you love me that's all happened and then it says that you know and it's amazing John's recording this about himself that Peter spied the disciple that Jesus loved and said what's going to happen to this guy and Jesus says what's it for you to know follow thou me he's a resurrected Lord Of Glory telling one of his disciples don't even worry about that stuff I'm not even really going to tell you follow me and we want an answer from God because we've been Googled we've been conditioned by Google and God doesn't answer us all things does he have to give you an answer he's God well that's not fair well I mean Daniel it's amazing you look at the Prophet Daniel because but I've been walking with God all this time the Prophet Daniel he came from Jerusalem as a Young Man decided to follow God he comes down to the end of his Road he's been walking with God I don't know how old he was when he died I haven't Googled it and he asked because he sees you know it says in Daniel with the you know the Ancient of Days would come forth white as wool and the Saints would be given the kingdom and all these things would happen and and Daniel said Lord when are these things going to happen and he's just told it's not for you to know do you read and I Daniel complained loudly and turned my back on God many days because he didn't tell me no he just walked with God cuz his strength was made perfect in his weakness he relied on God every day of his life Monday through Friday Saturday I don't know what they called them in those days but you know he relied on God so God's strength was made perfect in his weakness he was wise he he see we all have abilities God can't use them if we're not fully surrendered to him oh but I'm very gifted doesn't mean nothing that means you're just saying you're strong you've got to surrender all that you are to him and let him use it you're the king of sarus I think goes I don't have it in me but I I don't have it in me I don't I don't have the scripture in Ezekiel exactly but he says that you are wiser than Daniel he was a man who was wiser than Daniel incredibly Gifted Man but he used that gift to gather a kingdom to himself so he used that gift in his strength to do what he wanted to do how many people these very gifted people in the world what are they doing with that gift what are they doing with their lives amen so it's not see see the Apostle Paul remember he was he was the first church age Church age messenger gifts are born in a person he would have had a had a are you all following me today I feel like sometimes you might as well be talking in the mirror anyway but you know he was a very gifted he was a very I don't do that by the way he was a very gifted person right he was born with that gift that gift gave him influence among people but he had to realize he had to count that all but D that God would live oh look what I can do within no that's the problem you should be look what he can do in me in spite of me he can live in spite of me he can speak in spite of me he can sing Lord take my life and use it for your glory Lord I without you lord I can do nothing and that doesn't make me go to us I saying a Pity P party a pride thing poor me you're Moses got stuck in that he realized he was a complete failure and that failure haunted him for 40 years and God didn't feel sorry for him that he was in that state on the back side of the desert you know Moses got into a thing Paul me you know I can't speak no one will hear me no one will believe me me me me me his strength hadn't become perfect weakness yet though he had a high tempered wife on The Backs side of the desert and both him and sapora had high tempers and you know God used that too God uses the every day to get us into condition praise God you say man we're going through something in your family praise God God's getting you in condition amen he's wanting to use that that perfect strength of his will come forth it's isn't it amazing God takes us he does the opposite to what we think you know especially this pampered world we live in this this this this um Bubble Wrap kind of a world wrap up there's no problem everything's fine don't offend anyone don't don't calls people to go outside their comfort zone try and just keep them all cotton wo wrapped up God don't work that way God stirs The Nest am mean the eagle stirreth The Nest the Bible said chos God God don't you know just like an eagle imagine a mama Eagle there all powerful big wings and everything just just kept her babies in the nest like this modern day 2024 kind of parenting kind of a world you know so careful not to offend and you know so if it was that way they'd never leave the nest they would never see their built just like Mama they would never understand the things that they see her doing they can do it's within them the life within them is the same life as within her and they can fly like her they can catch pray like her they can scream like her they can you know they can do exactly like her they can only see that when they're flying amen and that's why Trouble Comes that's why God stirs our Nest is because he's getting us in condition that we that that we fly like he flies we speak like he speaks amen we act like he acts just like the babies act like Mama acts when they're flying see it's one thing to sit there on the nest and say wow that's amazing isn't this incredible wow the Apostle Paul look at all the things he did and everything but God wants to just push you out of the nest he wants to make your life uncomfortable not that you get a pity party in the corner of the nest that you leave the nest see we got to leave the pity party they're a downer anyway I've never seen anyone happy yeah s's having a py party woohoo no it's a downer it's unbelief speaking it's Pride speaking or you don't know the situation I've been in I tell you there's been Believers down Through the Ages had situations million times worse than us am mean our first world problems we can't complain oh the Wi-Fi is too slow oh but the him that overcometh know there's crazy stuff like that people get this attitude oh but you know oh McDonald's is closed or whatever you know like they people they think it's a struggle and the Apostle Paul's in prison he tells Timothy or Titus Winter's coming I need my coat and here's a man changed to a Roman soldier you know prisons in those days did not have under underfloor central heating they did not get three meals a day there was rats cockroaches damp cold dingy they didn't there weren't human rights today imagine the Apostle it's my human right you got to feed me man that would have been the biggest joke that went through the whole prison guards look at this guy come see him everyone it would have been so they would have laughed at him but oh but it's my right you know no so in his condition he got most of the New Testament amen his strength God had to take his strength away or get him to realize no you can't rely on yourself and that's and that and that thorn in the flesh that buffered him so what did it do it had a go him it left it came back he besought it three times Lord take this thing from me did the Lord take it from him they said no my grace is sufficient he just praised God in his trouble What About Us I'm having a bad day things are go I'm not trying to make light of problems okay but but but we need perspective I mean if if this man could be so surrendered to the will of God that he had a life of trouble now it's worth it Hallelujah but God God had him in a condition to prove it doesn't matter what's going on in our natural surroundings but God could have him a spiritual condition that God could reveal his mind to this man while sitting in prison like basically the Lord's saying well I've got more Epistles I need more more word released to my people so I'm going to put my so so where are you going to put your messenger god you going to put him in the Hilton in the H oh what about that nice Villa that Caesar so and so has nope where's he going to go in that prison in the inner prison that's where he's going to write this this is where he's going to dictate this letter to someone else this is where he's going to receive this Revelation he say well that's the Apostle Paul I don't receive Revelation you better receive Revelation where this word lives in your life that it's not just ink on paper but it's living in your soul amen that it's a reality to you amen that that what the Apostle Paul wrote about you can say Amen to it because you've experienced it because it's alive to you it's not a lecture it's a living word to you amen so so he could he could live in this way because of the state he was in he was an overcomer amen he say this is a bit heavy no this is glorious you think about it there's nothing there's no situ sitation too bad that God can't reveal himself in there's no place too dark no tunnel too long no trouble too great that God could not step into and Quicken his word to my soul to give me overcoming power Amen to give me strength for the battle to help me to walk through this trial praise God there's nothing too hard for God he say but I'm living under This Cloud just open the window let Faith come in remember the Apostle Paul can you imagine here's a man whole life was against God and then God had to get him off his high horse of Pride put him in the dust of Damascus Road he realized what he was and he realized what he is now amen and he stayed in that state it never left him can we not we canot we be the same way we have a testimony do we not has not God found your life was against God one day you're walking the other way amen you are working actively against them in unbelief but then God found you God called you hallelujah praise God amen amen and that's where God's strength came into him because he became perfectly weak amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord Amen brother Bram says this he says my speech this is why the Apostle Paul could come he says my speech wasn't in enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit of power now what what for Paul why' you do this power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God oh what a preacher this great man he sought God he said God I am weak I don't know what to do I pray you God to strengthen me take my infirmities take away from me these things so I can be stronger God spoke back to him said Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness then Paul said when I am weak then I am strong yes he said then I will glory in my infirmities of my weaknesses and so forth I'm thanking God that I've got all of it out of me so when I see everything out of me when I get everything out of me then God can come in but as long as I've got some of myself there then God can't get in I mean there that's where we smother him out we drive them away from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves amen praise God we don't have to stay that way amen that God's strength can become perfect in our weakness amen praise the Lord now Moses Moses became perfectly strong when he became perfectly weak On The Backs side of the desert amen where where in his strength he failed but in his weakness he triumphed amen same thing with all the Believers down Through the Ages Amen in their weakness they triumphed and their strength they failed amen so it's when we when we get weak when we realize we can't do it that's when God can step in amen that he can do what he wants see like but you see many times we can look at the disappointments of being perfectly weak now the now I'm I I'm actually going to wind up with this okay I don't I don't I don't want to be too long today but it says in the Book of James that Elijah was a man of like passions as you and I right all the Believers see all the Believers down Through the Ages they had their good times and their bad times they had their times of Peace their times of trouble their times of Calamity they they were human just like you and I right if we were transported back to Elijah's day we talk to him he said he's just like us or all the Believers down Through the Ages yep he's just like me you know he's just like you because because that we they're all men's um subject to like passions as we are same kind of emotions you know they never became robots amen they never became robots they were they men of like passions just like we are right but you see what happens is is there can be a there can be a a time when we are perfectly weak but the outcome is not what we expect now Elijah he would have he would have you know there he goes walking down samaria's Road he's going to go see Ahab and Jezebel he didn't look like much on the outside but a sheep skinn rugged guy hairy maybe you know baldheaded yo Baldhead glistening in the Sun but in his in his little Israelite heart was the fire of God burning and he walked there into the throne room and he and he said to Ahab and to Jezebel not not there won't be any rain or Jew until I call for it amen then he then he went from there you know he's fed by the Ravens and he went to the uh widow woman there and you know that widow woman became perfectly weak came perfectly weak but she was lining up for a miracle she didn't realize it brother said her husband was a great man of Faith but then he passed away it's just her and her son and and and and she went out got two sticks she's going to make their last cake and then that you know they were going to eat it and die a brother said that those two sticks symbolize the cross are your way of making a fire that lasts a long time apparently you get two logs put them cross the log like this light the fire underneath and just push the ends in so there she there she got this she was going to have her last meal with her son then die you see she came to a perfect weakness no one else had food she couldn't go to her neighbors the supermarket was empty countdown was closed pack and saved well that packed up a long time ago there was no food anywhere right and then so so she she realized she was in a state of perfect weakness she couldn't rely on her own ability whatever but then that was when God was going to step in and she was a Believer she didn't get angry at the prophet when the prophet came into her house she didn't say well if you're really a man of God why did God allow this to happen to me and all this problems no she didn't get mad at God that's why God sent the prophet her away amen and then and then he said well make me a cake first total stranger to her but make me a cake first but then your your your meal barrel barrel won't get empty your Cruiser o will never run dry Hallelujah she was at a state of perfect weakness then God stepped in amen and then God is instructed by Elijah to go to Ahab challenge him to a showdown so then they have Mount Carmel praise God the fire falls amen the great Victory is won see Elijah was perfectly weak but then he was uh in his own self he wasn't relying in his own ability to make the Fire Fall he was following the instructions of the word amen and then when he did that he you know you know he had the Altar and the and the water around it the wood and the sacrifice he says Lord I've done all this according to your word may all the people know that thou are the god in Israel you have turned their hearts back again and the fire fell amen consume the sacrifice we know the story right but and then he prayed earnestly that it would rain again then finally the seventh time when the servant goes up the hill he say see like a cloud like a man's hand right and then and then Elijah tells Ahab get home cuz I hear the sound of abundance of rain so he was staying perfectly weak the whole time his pride didn't Rise Up When God answered by fire see I told you look what I did no he stayed perfectly weak cuz he knew it was God that brought the fire it was God that brought the answer and God anointed him to outrun The Chariot but then he got the threatenings of Queen uh Jezebel saying I'm going to kill you so he ran for his life and there so so the outcome of what happened was probably the opposite he did not expect to be running for his life he did not expect that this this queen would give him a death sentence and all these things so he came to a juniper tree amen and then he begins to pray contrary to the will of God for his life he says God first he he he conf he gives a false testimony of his own own salvation he says Lord I'm just like my fathers I'm just like them he wasn't like his fathers he was living in Revival the fire of God that fell on the altar was already in him amen the spirit of God was leading him he wasn't caught up in some dead religious system with bow worship all these things no he wasn't worshiping in the high places he wasn't doing any of those things that weren't of God he was walking with God so he wasn't like his fathers but he got so worked up from the result of this so troubled am mean he said he he he was giving a bad confession about himself he says Lord let me die he was praying completely contrary to the will of God for his life who's done that let's be honest we've all done that well because of feelings and just being overwhelmed and all these things we get to a place where we're praying earnestly I doubt very much he sitting there calmly under the juniper tree dead God writing in his journal about the day he had no he was crying out he would have be made a you know you know the Dust by his knees would been covered in tears crying out to God God take my life I you know he felt like a complete I'm just like my father's La I cannot do this but was but he was still perfectly weak but he got overwhelmed because of the rejection so God placed him under a juniper tree amen and God sent his best Angels he saw he saw a servant under the juniper tree and he you know he called down the the cooking aisle of Heaven he got the best baker not just a b he didn't get me to bake the cakes okay he got the best one not that I'm an angel but you know what I mean he got the most skilled one who knew what they're doing amen get the best cakes and then the angel with the softest hands that can massage just right go down minister to him in his perfect weakness he's perfectly strong but he just got overwhelmed cuz he's a human right so God ministered to him under the juniper tree because he was walking in perfect weakness amen and many times in life we get overwhelmed God leads us to do all kinds of things and the result is not what we expect sometimes you think I'm just a complete failure no you're not a failure cuz you've been walking in perfect weakness that God's strength can be manifested so you've been doing exactly what God told you to do amen God's H God wasn't displeased with Elijah under the juniper tree he didn't kick him and say what are you doing here boy I told you to do this why are you crying no he he told his best Angels refresh my servant he's walking in my word he's made a stand for me amen he's overwhelmed because I know he's human I made him I know he's overwhelmed by this trouble you know he's so he feels so hurt by the rejection you know he's so he's so upset by what just happened though he saw the fire he's so thrilled with what I did but the people's responses brought him to this juniper tree it wasn't my response it was the people's response that caused them to come to the this place but it's all right I'm going to I'm going to massage his brow he's going to eat these cakes you know I'm going to refresh him that he can walk on because I'm not done with him I'm not done with him he's got work to do in Israel amen he's going to anoint Elisha that this faith is going to be passed on Amen he's going to do all these things and there's a chariot that's going to carry him home amen hallelujah but the reason that those things I've already ordained those things and I made him that he can walk in perfect weakness I made him to be this way this is not his ability angels I you I want you to understand this is not his ambition not his drive he wasn't looking for this but I found him and before he ever turned up on the earth I made him that he could walk in perfect weakness aren't you glad God made you that way aren't you glad that God made you a way that you can not rely on your own strength when you come in contact with the Eternal with the almighty Lord Jesus Christ you realize his strength is perfect his strength is all you need amen see the see the devil don't want you to realize that you can fully depend upon the Lord because it's in those silent times it's when trouble comes in it's those silent times where it looks like God is not speaking he's still working amen but he's testing you and I to see what are we going to rely on in those silent times are we going to rely on our ability our strength or we're going to rely on his strength amen so so no doubt he was crying he was all worked up and all these things and brother Braham asked this question now because when a showdown comes that's when trouble comes after Mount cell was a showdown God loves to prove who's who right irrespective of irrespective of what people do you say Thank You Lord amen thank you Lord for showing up it wasn't me testify you it wasn't my ability amen I remember going to someone's house and there was a this is years ago christe and I were there and you know there was a there was a guy trying to trying to over Lord on a young well teenage boy trying to basically control him and you know try and be the father in The Father's Place try and perverted and then and then well I was there so I just opened my big mouth and we started to share about no you got to because this person was trapped into doing something then then this man was trying to tell the parents what the son had done but not in order that that that the son would be sorry and there'd be healing and repentance and prayer and so on but that this man would have control over this boy that was the whole purpose of it so we went in there we just say well you just got to surrender to God just let God do you know you know you got to give your life to the Lord you don't need to surrender to a person surrender to him amen cuz that's what we got to do we don't surrender to one another I mean you don't give your life to me that's the craziest foolish thing you could ever do in your life give your life to the Lord Jesus Christ amen but this man was trying to get this boy to do that to him and so we started to talk just just say just no give your life to the Lord he'll give you the Holy Ghost he'll change you he can help you through these things right and then and then the father go said okay we're all going to pray and we started praying and the father prayed and it was like a being he stepped in the Lord stepped in the atmosphere just changed it's like he literally joined the circle you feel him right there and then the tongue's interpretation came God backed up just give your life to me I'll give you the Holy Ghost now the man who was doing that thing he he actually just fled the scene felt very uncomfortable the spirit was very uncomfortable now the people after that it was like Mount camel they weren't rejoicing there was a big backlash against those things yeah these things happen well you just doing what you feel the Lord wants you to do and there's just this big backlash against it by so-called Christians you say well why is this you know this doesn't seem right but then you find yourself well now you're just actually under a juniper tree you say well was it worth it it's always worth it following God the Apostle Paul said I have a Crown of Life For Me he say where did where did this where did this Faith end him up where did he end up with this faith in a prison with a death sentence oh was that worth it it's absolutely would I do it again 100% cuz he said it was revealed to him in those troubles I've got a crown of life waiting for me and not me only but all those that love his glorious appearing amen so his perfect weakness revealed to him that perfect strength that he's got a crown and a body Hallelujah everything's Over Yonder waiting for him so he had he had the blessings of God in this life but it wasn't just that was just a down payment that's just a small thing compared to what he had on the other side so we can end up in a juniper tree I'm just going to finish with a juniper tree but just remember you say Lord I was following you you proved yourself why is this I feel so overwhelmed and then and then what does he do angels yeah Angel remember you Bak the cake for Elijah there's another servant of mine on the earth with the same fath the fire of God's burning in their heart too go feed them angel with the best massaging hands you know what you did to Elijah they're in that same state just go calm them down a little bit they're waiting they under the juniper tree don't you hear their prayers Lord they want to die yeah Elijah prayed that too but they've got a chariot waiting for them as well amen they've still got a work to do upon the Earth amen well they they're hurting they're overwhelmed little can't you see yeah I can see but my strength is made perfect in their weakness my grace is sufficient for them I'm going to reveal myself to them in a greater way than what they even know it's worth it all aren't you glad we can have junip Petry aren't you glad that if we stay in perfect weakness say Lord I don't want my strength to live I'm no I'm I'm closing I'm closed I'm done let the musicians come please but but aren't you glad as they come aren't you glad we can be perfectly weak we can be perfectly strong when we're perfectly weak amen you say but this happened to me and I've got a right to do this and this and this no just stay perfectly weak committed to the Lord Brother Braham has asked this question uh this is this is from what doest thou here in 1959 there he laid under the juniper tree he didn't know what to do his nerves was broke he was shaking he was crying no doubt and he was in a terrible condition many of us hit those places especially after a mount carel experience it was asked me the other day by someone about that and um what would um what would be what can be done for us at that time there's only one thing to do commit yourself to God that's just commit yourself to God the angels are on their way with the best cakes the best massaging hands amen the best shade tree he wants to rest you a while but he doesn't leave you there he says now look I'm going to tell you what you're going to do after this amen let's stand shall we let's sing that song shall we let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich let the blind say I can see it's What the Lord Has
