wonderful surprise god bless you amen trust you feel at home I mean thank you bit me on the piano man oh god bless you great have you both Amen let's um yeah let's just turn to the scriptures turn to Matthew chapter 15 and their trusty ones had a good week we're gonna read Matthew 15 read from verse 10 there we go Matthew 15 verse 10 we're gonna read down to verse 28 of a lengthy reading but here with me it says and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which cometh which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man then came his disciples and said unto Him knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard the saying but he answered and said every plant which my Heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up he says let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind they shall fall into the ditch the in' answered Peter and said unto Him declare unto us this parable and Jesus said are you also yet without understanding do ye do not yet understand that whatsoever entereth in it the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man proud of the heart proceeds I mean proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications there false witnesses blasphemies these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man now notice so we've just read this and we're just gonna continue reading on so he's saying it's not what you do physically with unwashed hands and what they were all caught up and it's what comes out of your heart defiles you what comes out of the mouth and then we come into this immediately after this he's showing then then we have this story of those rinsing how the scriptures written here then Jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of Tyre and and Sudan and behold a woman of cane and came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord what's what's coming out of her heart now just just what what's coming out of her heart have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cries after us was she's actually only crying after him anyway and but he answered and said I am NOT sent I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel then came she and worshipped him saying the Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered a sinner said unto her o woman great as thy faith be it unto thee even as their will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour I mean let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer gracious father we're so thankful that Lord you are present among us Lord Jesus by your grace you have come down it's not just us being identified with you but you've come to be identified with us Lord by your Redemption and father we just want to pray as we have read from your scriptures now Lord I probably say to every service but anyone can that can read can read your word but it takes you to make it live so father Lord you being the great author of your word may and manifest at now Lord anchored into every soul Lord may we walk out of this place Lord changed Lord more like you molded and shaped into your image Lord take your word and by your Holy Spirit may you just engrave it into the tables of our hearts father Lord may you grant that Lord we just want to commit the service into your hands Lord we just think of the fray homely in Arizona Lord Jesus brother Daniel's mother they're going into Hospice father I pray Lord you would be very present Lord be law these last don't know how long Lord she will remain on the earth being up in years but father you know Lord that time and Lord we just pray that she'll be ready to cross Lord that when she leaves this world she'll go into your presence Lord Lord may you grab that father we want to pray for a little sophocles Lord with a high temperature father may he touches body Lord take that away from him father Lord may you heal them completely Lord for your glory and Lord we also want to pray for brother Andy and brother Adrian father Lord may you just be with them as they're ministering soon or Lord I don't know what the time is time difference exactly but father may be a resurrection day Lord God and Vietnam Lord may many of your children go from death to life father by your word anointing them as they Lord take them out of the way and speak through them the words of life father Lord there would be a resurrection day in Vietnam father may you grant it Lord and we just want to commit ourselves into your hands as well Lord in Jesus Christ name Amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats this morning so I've got a few technical things difficulties going on but just just be with us today so I want to talk about faith during the time of the Son of Man now we understand that the scripture is repeated the same Jesus that walked in the on the shores of Galilee is here not in that physical format the same God as among us and we see his people here approach him in that day they approach him in this day in the same manner we have the scribes and Pharisees they they mocked or made fun of them they got their reward but there were people like this this Gentile and we read about that she approached him and she got her reward and it all depends how you approach the work today as what you'll get you'll either get a good reward or a very bad one it's like the woman with the blood issue she said if I could but touch the hem of His garment I'll be made whole she knew that he had what she needed and she was determined that she will get what she needs and it must be the same thing because this society we live in is very much because you know there's good things about the society but there's bad things it's good that the state can look after us if we're homeless right so it's so in that way it's good but in a way it's bad because we can just sit back and someone else will take care of it you know there's not a you know it's just as she'll be right mate let's just cruise let's take it easy there's not a real grit determination you know I must get what I need you understand and I'm talking about spiritual things more in that way will you just sit back and watch the world go by and nothing's all that bad and you know it's all fine we've got to throw that off right we should have some determination and I'll walk with God God you have precious promises you've given them given them to me I mean by your sacrifice of Calvary I want to possess those promises I don't just want a little bit of the inheritance I want everything you've given me I want to possess the whole thing I want to see how it works I want to try it out I want to test it I want to test into the fullness of its abilities I don't just want to look at it I want to possess it you ever seen a child Christmas or birthday they just open a present take off the wrapping and they leave it in the box have you ever seen a child like that they don't say well that's nice and I'll just leave it here and no they're ripping the thing out you know they're taking the taking out of the package they're not worried about breakfast in are worried about anything else they want to play with their toy and then they get on it the may like a bike and they're up and down and up and down up and down and you know they want to see what it can do we should be like that with the Word of God don't just look at the wrapping and say well that's nice wrapping or bad wrapping or whatever you consider it you know look what has he given me as the Bride of Christ what has he given me I want to enjoy it when someone gives a gift they want to see the person enjoy that I mean they want to see do they really enjoy what I've given do they really appreciate it and it should be the same thing with us now God has given us his word it's been unveiled in this hour we're not guessing at it we know what we know our position in Christ we know what his promises are for us we shouldn't just say well that's nice we say I want to enjoy this I mean I want to enjoy this word and see what God has done for me right so this woman had a determination she wasn't willing just to look at this you know discouragement that she could have just gone off from the first from the first instance he just did he just ignored her she knew this is the source of the healing of a over of a daughter right and then but then she approaches him as a son of David she's a Gentile she has no claim on him a son of David but he just fled ignores her and then even the disciples say send her away for she Christ after us okay our faith is going to go beyond it's got to go beyond people discouraging us or beyond circumstances that don't work our way amen if you have real faith you know it's there for you it's not all it's not I hope it'll work you know to work you know the promises yeah amen you know it will manifest you're going to piss through the discouragement right you're a pest through the circumstance she was determined she was determined she had nothing else to lean on she only had the source of the the fountain of eternal life and she knew it was him right we have to be this way friends we need a bit of gumption we need a bit of rawness you're a bit of determination I will not leave you till you bless me amen on I'll leave your presence till you change me I mean I'm not leaving till you transform me renew me whatever I need wash me cleanse me by your word I'll not leave your presence until you change me that should be our determination I mean as a bride is going to walk out of this earth victorious I want to be in that number I don't just want to be under the effect of a group of a church but I want to take a rapture like as many of we we'll feel the pull of the hour but they'll be left behind don't feel just to pull of the hour be left behind feel the pull respond and and go right because it's why the atmosphere so I such a charged atmosphere where God's children gather because God's there it wants to get your attention he wants to wake you up out of this lady or C&H wake up children it's time to go we don't want to just sit back and he said that's pretty intense gods and teens because God wants you to walk on streets of gold he wants you there more than you want to be there he wants to give you a body change more than you want it right he's intense hallelujah there's a power in this room amen to set you free if you'll receive it so she had a bit of discouragement and it was God Himself was the one who was trying to throw her off God does that sometimes to you what's the heat because he really wants to see as your as your faith genuine or is it just because everything's going well do you worship Him because life is easy or because you receive some kind of blessing I move being lost and I'm done I pray God and I was I was going to be kicked out of the Hall as in at university I had no money I said god I need a job and I got a job the next week think God answers prayer whatever condition you babe you know you may be in but what I'm saying is you don't just want to just because he's good to you I didn't worship him just cause he was good to me I wish him now because he died for me he redeemed me right many people say why he's good to me he's a good God he's going to be more than just a good god to you right I don't worship him because things are just going well that's irrelevant the status of life here and it's irrelevant you worship Him because of who he is and because he's revealed themselves to you that's why we're Christians is it not because he's the very lord of glories made himself known through the same time message Jesus Christ has been revealed he's made himself known unto you and that's why you worship Him I trust that's why not because life is good or bad or whatever worship him anyway because the devil that's why the devil he said do you know you know he said to God about job the only reason Jobe worships you is because everything goes well I'll prove that's wrong God has to have some jobs and your trial may never be as Extreme as Jobs was but you're still having but a hardship because God is willing to show Satan you see this one actually is perfect this one is perfect there's none like them in this place because they worship me doesn't matter if it's good or bad they still love me the Lord giveth the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord that was job's response he didn't understand what was going on he didn't have the understanding we have even have the revelation we we have all he had was take the lamb it's gonna be without blemish off of the lamb you're accepted that's all he had that's nothing compared to what we have right and you he could stand there just on that sacrifice because God said so because God ordained this way and he just stood there on that he didn't understand he said if a tree or a tree you know you know he could see a nature God and nature of flower comes up in the springtime comes in his beauty autumn time it dies he goes into the ground comes back to life again you know that you're the next spring he saw the death burial resurrection of nature they said a man he dies where does he go he had no idea it he could stand there on that on that lamb sacrifice amen and we've had someone go beyond the curtain of time and come back I mean if he can tell someone where their addresses and what they're wrong with them and you know I believe that same vision is true right so we've had we've had evidence in this hour not just in the word but in this hour if someone has gone beyond the curtain of time amen so we have a lot more we know our Redeemer liveth right I know my redeemer lives not because someone told me because he came to me amen and I know that there'll be a day that I'll stand on this earth with him hallelujah I trust you can say yeah that's happened to me too because it changes everything because life is but a vapor but yet when all things are done we'll still be rejoicing in him so now if she was I'm just going to break this down but remember we read before the scripture Jesus says it's what comes out of the heart defiles the men what comes out of your heart what do you speak that really defiles you so I'm taking notes interesting how he talks about that he goes and then this account is here he's showing what actually also comes out of your heart will redeem you will help you will heal you will deliver you your response right and so he answered and said I'm not sent but the lost house of a lost sheep of the house of Israel being came she and worshipped him saying lord help me so she changed her approach because he is Lord of all so it's just Lord helped me not son of David because she wasn't a Jew he's only son of David to the Jew so she had no approach to him that way but Lord he's Lord of all so lord help me so now she's a prey and she's coming even more humble just help me help me but then he answered and said it's not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs he's saying you're not even worthy to receive her any of us Oh put yourself in her shoes what would have you done oh this is a judgmental God Oh huh look how critical he is oh I'm done I'll find something else she wasn't like that she knew that this was the only source she knew it was him she knew this is what he need what she needed for her daughter was in him and nothing discouraged her because she knew the source right and she kept going until I get ahold of that source and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table I may be that Lord but I'll Here I am they still get something they still get something hallelujah then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith I'd like that when he when he would write my epitaph or whatever greatest though his faith was great her faith was great she stood great tests great adversity I tried to even discourage her but she still kept going what about is that you it has to be you if this is Gentile faith when the Son of Man was here the first time it'll be Gentile faith when he returns right to this same faith we'll be in a people now so I trust you can say yeah this is me doesn't matter what my family does what people say what people do I'm walking on with you Lord Jesus I'm walking on amen beard unto thee even as thou will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour amen you mean you can go to God and you can get what you need and a devil can be cast off someone absolutely absolutely it happened here it happens now that same God is present upon the earth he's not just up in heaven he's present I mean we can't touch the hem of his garment by faith that's what he said that's what Paul says in the book of Hebrews we have a high priest we can touch by the feeling of our infirmities right and he is still our high priest that's why brother Branham was there and and and he point someone out in the audience you this is what you're praying for this is what's wrong with you this person listen they said who did they touch they're 20 30 feet from me they touch the high priest they couldn't touch me because they're there they touch the high priest because the high priest was on the platform revealing I mean through that vessel what they needed because they by faith that's the high priest the high priest was there hallelujah and that same high priest is present amen that is not pie in the sky whatever you want to that's reality that's reality that same Jesus that was there is here amen I believe it no this isn't perseverant and here's the word made manifest you can tell him the word and he'll say Amen it's being of a real believer the other will say I don't know about that seed donkey hybrid see he don't know where he's going he don't know where he come from he's in an awful shape that woman wasn't that type the other one when we just read she wasn't no hybrid plant she got ahold of something you didn't have to baby here and spray her and say now darling please now let me beg you you should come down no sir nobody everything trying to hinder her a real Christian fights for his position right a real Christian fight are you gonna fight field position it's not just given to you you gotta fight for it like the promised land God said well I give it to you B gonna fight for every inch of ground God gives us whole things but you going to go possess it right let's not just sit back and if it be it'll be no let's take it someone's got to do it it may as well be us amen why not you why not now Amen God God wants to see what you're gonna do that's that's so good about our having a free moral agency God's gonna see what are you gonna do about it right amen I'd press in a real Christian fight for his position he has to stand alone him and God and he fights every inch of ground so you don't have to baby them around he says that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal Church today we've got Pentecostal babies that's just being sprinkled and sprayed with this and that the other till they run out to a bunch of hybrids what we need today as a house cleaning from the pulpit all the way to the janitor and start over again and get some genuine faith born into the people what's a genuine faith take God at His Word only believe the word irrespective of circumstance what do you think about it what do you think take him at his word real genuine faith is only believe the word right that is real genuine faith it's not how you feel I mean because if you just go by feeling you'll feel wonderful one day and you'll feel terrible the next and when you're feeling wonderful you think I'm ready for a rapture when you're feeling terrible you think how am I ever going to get there and the devil takes your feelings and beat you around you've got to cast out your feelings cast out reasoning and only believers word amen no glory this doesn't doesn't perseverant as well but even now whatever you ask God God will this is breaking into the story of Lazarus oh I love that you say brother branham I being this way a long time but even now brother bran the doctor told me I had a heart trouble I might die at any moment but even now Lord you say but brother Brown I meet up with cancer but even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you he's sitting at the right hand of the Father to make intercession even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you I can see him this is now Jesus Lazarus tomb he goes there this is a woman's faith in the time of the Son of Man he goes in Mary and Martha have already called for for Jesus to come Lazarus was sick he doesn't go he he actually goes the other way and then he's dead he's been in the grave for days now I'll go wake him and then when they both go out does it oh you know if you had come Lord my my brother wouldn't have died but even now even now I know he can come back to life even now I trust you have that in your heart even now lord I may be in the state for a long time but even now even now you can change me even now you can change my situation even a content I look at your work even now Lord I've been in this slump for a long time even now even though challenge God that's my silent scream challenge God don't just sit he's wanting to see what are you gonna do I've been this way even now we don't have to put up with the status quo we don't have to wait for a new years to turn or turn a new leaf and make a resolution because that doesn't do any good anyway don't weigh for a time and the county say even now right now in the present even now Lord I can see him he wasn't much to look at way to by sorry about there there we go actually yeah we'll read it then we'll come back to that technology now see I can see him he wasn't much to look at at the bottom of the court the Bible said there's no beauty that we should desire him he wasn't a great big six-four he was a little frail fellow he straightened up his little frame up stopped and the shoulders as he was he said he was grain as bed before your city is all before he he stooped in his shoulders like they said thy brother shall rise again oh my she said yes Lord I know he'll raise again at the last day was what he said this for the account but that's not what he's wanting to get you to understand because we all understand yes one day one day it'll happen one day we'll take a rapture one day we'll be fine one day I'll be healed God doesn't want you to pull off one day he wants you to bring into the present and this is where they were they're staying before the tomb God Jesus is speaking to speaking to Mary or Martha and she says yes one day he'll raise again the general resurrection be sure I said no don't don't look there we look here I am the resurrection life leave Earth Alice do you believe this I am presently now the resurrection the life Jesus asked her amen and so he wants to ask you the same question he wants you to have the same faith not in the not in the not in the future now even now presently now I know them Jews believed in the general resurrection see I know he will raise at that last day he was a good boy and God will raise him up at the last day I can see Jesus say but I am the resurrection and the life I am NOT I will be I was I am present tense and he still is the resurrection and the life present tense the Son of man present tense Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever today is the main part we should emphasize he's the same today as he was yesterday I am the resurrection life he that believeth in me shall never die oh my he said I am the resurrection life saith the LORD he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whom so ever liveth and me shall and believeth in me shall never die so you'd believe without us she said yea Lord I believe you I believe you're just what you said you it's what comes out of the heart we're taking the officer from defile it redeems it's it's free it heals right what comes out of the heart what's your confession he's the high priest of our confession a profession so he can only act based on your confession his hands are tied until you confess it he can't do anything until you ask him right so so what are you confessing what are you professing it's entirely up to you now I believe you just I believe you're the Son of God I believe you're the lord of heaven that came down here on earth and whatever you ask God God will give it to you I believe that you're the son of God that was to come upon the earth oh my something has to happen something has to happen things were coming like this coming together oh my said where have you buried him see something has to happen when you have this kind of faith when you have this kind of confession just like Hedy right she said the right she said the right words that's nothing but the truth brother Brenham when he's telling about the squirrels then God came down ask what you will you got sick parents you've got a sister in the wheelchair you know you're poor ask for a million dollars it'll fall in your lap right now he challenged her but then but then she saw the her two boys and they are believers and God came down she said I want the salvation of my two boys spirit of God fell upon them they were laughing at the whole thing God got ahold of them right and they became believers because she responded to the testimony that's nothing but the truth this parent testimony and the same God that was there you say well brother Browns gone we can't have that kind of result yes you can when the word goes forth you say there's nothing something should anchor in your soul that's nothing but the truth hallelujah I believe God have given what you need I happen to believe the same God was theirs here I'm just that maybe if you call me crazy I'm very happy being this way because he's present he's with us he's holding us by the hand we don't need to work at he's working it out amen that's nothing about the truth brother branham and she received salvation amen for her two sons for her family under the third poll she received that and it's more there should be more than a story to you there should be yes Lord you are the same God today we have the same kind of needs with the same kind of burdens we can't humanly do it we need you to come and do it but it all depends on your response if she laughed they would have stayed unbelievers if she was indifferent she would have stayed they would have stayed unbelievers if she doubted they would have stayed their way but something interstate I believe that she didn't say where you got to show me a squirrel show me evidence she said just believe that a man as she got what she needed hallelujah now we're going back to this I said I'd read it no he says here he says he that exalts himself shall be abased the way up as always as down always remember she never had seen a miracle she was a Gentile but she had faith to speak of the woman we read about she had never seen a miracle she was a Gentile but she had faith she was something like the harlot Rahab she said to the spies she didn't say well wait till I see how Joshua Combs is here or how does your generals how do they look at what kind of swords to do use what kind of instruments have you got what kind of warfare she said I've heard that God's with you that's good enough for me I want mercy she believed faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God watch for this saying for the Saint Jesus here because she was persistent and coming now first she called him son of David but but now now she had as a Gentile no claims on him of son of David but when she said Lord he gay he was her Lord but not son of David to it she had the right approach to God's gift and that's the only way ever to receive anything is to come the right approach right you got to come the right way and you'll get what you need amen now we're just gonna one day there won't be a PowerPoint now I am the resurrection and life I hope you don't mind that's reading he that believeth in me shall never die my he said I'm resurrection life saith the Lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live but whatever liveth shall I believe with him me shall never die believe without us she said yay Lord I believe you I believe so I'm just rereading this again because I want to get down to the bottom leave it the others she said yeah Lord I believe you I believe you're just what you said you were I believe you're the Son of God I believe you're the Lord of Heaven that come down here on earth and whatever you ask God God will give it to you I believe that you're the son of man that was going to come upon the earth oh my something has to happen something has to happen things were coming like this something our coming together oh my seed where have you buried him come and see here he goes a little lady belong to certain church tried to argue with me not longer a scientist Church note everything scientifically she said Reverend Branham do you mean to tell me that you believe he was divine I said I know he was divine she said he was just a man I said he was more than a man and you've got to have the same corner he was more than a Jew he was more than just a prophet he was the God prophet right now we're just gonna go but a certain direction he says now in Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him right it's not casually seek Him or just to stab in the dark kind of seek Him diligently he rewards those that diligently seek Him right so if you but first you've got to know that he is not that he was I trust you haven't received this because of Western tradition that this is the Word of God because Western civilization by tradition says this is God's Word right but you've got to receive it more than tradition you got to actually have a revelation this is God in print right you've got to say this is more than a having many authors however long ago this is God in print right you actually actually have to have that understand you know that revelation this is more than some scribe this is God and print form it's more than just a nice nice book of ethics this is God in print right so you gotta believe that he is you had to believe his word --is and he's a reward of them that diligently seek him now that woman diligently sought him out and got what she needed there should be the same thing today but now also there's a change in people when they actually get in contact with them because now they're not looking at in just natural life they're looking to where they're going okay and then so here in Hebrews 11 further down this is after he's spoken about Abraham and Isaac and Jacob but all those different heroes of faith we we call us his Hebrews 11 it says these all died in faith having not received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country so they didn't even receive the promise but they sort of far-off and even just seeing it afar off they embraced it their whole lives were changed because they saw the promise of far-off how about those with a promise is not afar off anymore but it's come nigh right the promise of the body changes and far off it's not it's not a hundred years away or maybe ten years away the promise is here you know it's not just all one day of people will be made in His image the promise is here right oh one day that people will grow into the fullness of the statue of Christ it's not one day it's now right if they can embrace the promises of far off and say we you know we are seeking a you know we're just strangers and pilgrims on the earth how much were people where the promise is not afar off that's what I'm saying the problems this is so up-to-date today this is today's newspaper the messages today's newspaper it's incredible to see the things that brother Bram said and now very much manifested it's not afar off it's here I mean so so if that was their testimony that we're just strangers and pilgrims on the earth we're just passing through how much more you and I we're very much Pilgrims and strangers we're very much in transit I've got my passport I've got my visa I'm just waiting for my plane hallelujah I trust that your how you live more than just yes that's true but and you say yes I'm waiting for my boarding call holy a my bags are packed I'm not turning back I'm not looking you know for any other place I'm on my way and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out of they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is and heavenly where of God is not ashamed to call to be called their God for he has prepared for them a city they were not even mindful of the place they left this is how real the promise was afar they embraced it but it wasn't so real to them they weren't even mindful where they came from how about you and I amen he has proved it and it's not just prepared for the Emmis city he's prepared for us a city I mean we had a prophet come and tell you about the city tell you about the new body you're gonna step into so it's not just you know we're aware of where we're going and where we're going to live hallelujah so we shouldn't even be they weren't mindful where they came from I'm not mindful of the world I came out of I'm not even mindful of it oh yeah there's no I wouldn't I would there be my worst nightmare to have an opportunity to go back into it you know if it's such a great place why are we here all those who came out of the world if it's such a wonderful place why are you why are you not in it why have you come out amen if it's so great why are you here young people look at your parents if the world is so great why they yeah it's not a great place there's nothing for us there hallelujah I'm glad our inheritance isn't upon this earth it's in heaven amen now I like this this is this is just a leaper I love it how the people that came to the Lord that humanely should have received the promise were rejected like the scribes and Pharisees or the religious ones and those who are broken and full of this man for example full of leprosy the outcasts of society you know the Gentiles who here didn't even have a portion of the inheritance they came and got what they needed the illiterate fisherman became apostles the woman at the well became I mean she evangelized the whole city hallelujah she had greater success and the priests hallelujah I'm glad that's how God works don't you Amen now here we are and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man full of leprosy so not just the start of leprosy he was full of leprosy who seeing Jesus fell on his face and besought him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and he put for this hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean and immediately the leprosy departed from him now he was a man he was full of leprosy leprosy is a type of sin in the Bible we know this man was full of sin Hey not just the start of sin entering in his life and he starting his backslide or whatever it is the world he was full of it he was it was a fully mature sickness but he knew that the Lord could heal him here's the fountain of healing here's the one who can heal this incurable disease he's a very source of it if thou will and of course he will eventually he is the fountain of healing he's a fountain of deliverance he's the founder of restoration of redemption of forgiveness amen he's and he wants to pour out amen he wants to give himself he wants to pour himself out so of course he say if thy will and the loss of course I will this is why I'm here this is my purpose of being manifested flesh is that the sick would be healed the loss would be found I mean the Brooklyn would be healed the demon-possessed would be made whole again hallelujah sways upon the earth I mean my people would be gathered to me hallelujah you have the same I trust you can say the same thing if that will of course a little sour will he had the right faith I know you can do it I just come he didn't say now you're obligated to me God this if I will I will and immediately the leprosy departed from him hallelujah we have to have their save got a faith he can and he will and he does not I might not not a maybe you know this is me if he's healed now if one of us promises a true all of us promises are true okay so if he's a healer he's a deliverer right and if he's a and also if he's a healer he fills with the Holy Ghost right and if he heals I'm just using the healing but to show all of his attributes are true if that's true right so if he's healed you I mean he will deliver you right if he's healed you he'll transform your body amen if he's healed you he'll take you in a rapture the same faith then get healing is the same way they can take a rapture he follow me Abraham had the same faith from what from from the first time we said depart out of thy country I'll take you to another place that same faith that took him there was the same faith that made him receive the promised son Amen we what why do we belittle our faith why do we put our human understanding on our faith a faith worked one time it'll work the second time and it'll work the next time and it work the next time but how God answers that faith is purely up to him right because sometimes you know if he just did this all the time would have no character because faith worketh patience and we'll come into that later so God God will heal us instantly he's the divine healer God or maybe precious of time maybe he'll use doctors maybe changing diet whatever will be God wants to show himself with all those different ways god is not a cookie cutter David took the sling he killed Goliath there's no record of of using a sling anymore he picks up a sword one time he goes into the battle there's some bleep race Lord should I go he says no don't go do this and he does another way and he wins the battle you know God you gotta be sensitive God how are you leading me through this trial I'm glad God's that way I'm glad God's not just a 1d or 2d you know he wants to express the fullness of his character to you you just have to be still and know that He is God amen no let's just continue this and he charged him to tell no man that go and show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded for a testimony unto them but so much the more went there a Fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him for their infirmities and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed hey that's what happens now they say now his Gentile faith as well that was a I think there was a Jew that leper now back in the Gentile faith this is the story of the Centurion now the Centurion had a understanding of God more than the scribes and Pharisees and we're going to see this and when Jesus was incident at Capernaum I'm trying to build faith today okay I want you to really if we could you know it's like Elijah with a servant there there in Dothan wherever they are you know the you know there yeah yeah the servant goes out and he any any basically oh you could say goes out in the morning put some milk bottles by the front front gate he sees all the Syrians camped about the city and he panics he goes to Elijah and says where we're surrounded we're gonna die basically they're gonna take the city that are after you and I'm your servant everything's going bad and Elijah is just relaxed don't worry about it everything's fine when's breakfast ready you know I'm just dramatized a little bit but but he wasn't he wasn't worried and he just prayed and he stood in his service still panicking he just says Lord open open the boy's eyes he sees the army of heaven encamped about the Prophet that servant was now more distressed about the army of heaven than the Syrian one he forgot about the Syrian one because he was now supernatural army that army was on the side but if God opened our eyes and saw the angels in the three and and any open their eyes we could see God here right we would be a lot more you know all the burdens of last week and next week and next month they'll just disappear because you'd understand God's with me yeah you know the armies of heaven a present hallelujah tis more for us and against us I mean and that's why Elijah's not worried and he goes out there smite them blind who you looking for and the very one that they're looking for they they can't even recognize them and they lead them to the capital Samaria I mean young you know there is a story but the Prophet wasn't worried prophet wasn't worried we shouldn't be worried right we shouldn't be worried he said well I don't feel the whole bunch but what does your faith tell you I happen to believe when he said and when he promised to me I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee I just believe it I just I just spent simple it's like a child you tell them something that's okay and they go off they just take it childlike faith they don't work it out and how's this going to happen and you know I do so many different things in the day will you be here and here and here know this okay he'll never I will never leave thee nor forsake thee thank you lord I happen to just take him at his word now here he comes into Capernaum and they came unto Him a Centurion beseeching him said Lord my servant life at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus said unto him saith unto him I will come and heal them now this is the Jews they need laying on of hands as a Josh more reducing like Jiraiya says daughter Jesus went into dry sirs house you know she was dead he your he dross called him to go to the house being a Jew but now he's a Gentile the Centurion answered said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed right for I'm a man under Authority having soldiers under me see this man yeah you know I just like his thinking soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goes and to another come and he cometh into my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed their sounds you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel that's how great and the reason his faith was so great is because this centuries he just speak the word and my servant shall be healed so the servant had I mean the Centurion had a revelation that if God sends his word that's exactly the same as him being there so him sending his word that he'd be healed by his word was exactly the same to the Centurion as if Jesus himself was in the room right and this is Gentile faith he has sent his word upon the earth right he has sent his word upon the earth and its fullness has been poured out amen that's why so G so his if his word is here because he is his word he is present does Gentile faith right he's already sent his word it's already been released he's already here to do what he said he would do hallelujah that's real Gentile faith although Gentiles how are we today hallelujah now beer be this in mind that Roman knew that every sickness and disease was subject to his word now if you can realize the same it's all over see when you can realize the same that every demon every sickness every disease every affliction is subject to the word of God just speak the word and my servant will get well amen it's already done he's already we have to I trusted the same faith God's here I'm not talking about these four walls wherever you are I trust he's with you wherever you go right he's already sent his word upon the earth now my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience faith trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so when your faith has tried it works patience we all need patience right in this instant world we need patience and that's when our faith has tried as when it seems that the promise is lingering but God is looking to test you do you serve Him just because he's like an errand boy or a you know magic rabbit foot that you rub and you get what you want or is it because he is God faith worketh patience now therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only and not only so but we glory in tribulations also do we glory in tribulations hallelujah things are going terrible glory to God God has a purpose of doing it they meant just like the Sarah Phoenician woman there you know that that that God was trying to discourage when it when she is going to get healing for her daughter right God has a purpose of doing it to see to see what's really in you right and now also act okay mister yeah and not only so we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience we have to have supreme confidence you have to have supreme confidence that he is your head hey when I died when I when I totally died out to myself was born again by his spirit I was actually giving all of my rights and my own ability and putting all the responsibility of me upon him I am now his responsibility you are not your own you're bought with a price the scripture says right so if he is it if I am his responsibility he is obligated to look after me so I am now his problem I'll put it that way I am his problem I was my own problem it didn't go very well but then when I became his problem he's obligated to his word he's going to look after me but then I have to have confidence that he will look after me right and God allows many situations in our life to come because he wants to see do you really trust me do you really love me each other he challenges your faith he wants actually see do you really love me amen and if you love him you trust him a lot more than just trust right amen no and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is she'd abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us amen now but in the and the Greek this is from the Strong's Concordance patience is a cheerful or hopeful endurance cheerful or hopeful a cheerful and your endurance Amen this is patience right and in hope hope is not like English hope well what we would define as hope as hope and English is like a stab in the dark like someone who goes and buys a lot of ticket and I prayed is known here and I said well I hope I win the lotto they don't know they just like a stab in the dark let's see if it works but Bible hope is not that way Bible hope is witches of the primary way to anticipate usually with pleasure she under I say I'll use my this is the beam dictionary this kind of Hope is like an expectation was his expectation it's going to happen right so it's not a hope it works your under expectation at will that's real Bible hope right so it's not will our hope as promises are true your under expectation cuz you know they're true amen and the hope maketh not ashamed right and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is she'd abroad in our hearts the Holy Ghost which is given it up yo unto us so we have an evidence right that the expectation will be met hallelujah I trust you have that expectation my trust is not here it's in here because of it's in here it's gonna stay true but this thing all a lot of things go on up there we don't worry about that one be not I mean if it's in here it's anchored it's anchored because God has anchored you're his word into your heart Amen now and out of the heart the mouth speaketh now we could go to the woman at the well the woman at the well her faith was we know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things so she had she wasn't looking she was looking at scriptural vindication deceitful as him or not because she he just said to her go get your husband she says I have none you know you're right that's right Jesus said you've had five the one you're with is not yours and so he was discerning what was going on in her life and it wasn't someone here as a backache or or a knee pain or you know someone as a financial need that statistically you could get that in any crowd and then people take that as God discerning no that's not God deserting that's just a guess right some what I could well someone here will have a financial need Amen oh that was God no that's just a guess because in a big enough crowd someone has Polly knee pain someone is not well and body.feel someone you know you will yeah we're human we have these things but if God comes and says this is your name you there in that dress you're this and this is your your name and this is your address and it will help you this and this and this you go find it and you've come here for this and the person next year you see God come down and brother brands mercies is this one and then one Nick she's got this one Nick she's got this one if she's got this and in those kind of meetings the people on the other end of the row actually got out because they don't want an one themselves to be discerned and that happened thousands and thousands of times we know where Messiah cometh he'll do these things Peter speaks to them he that changed her life hallelujah because that light struck that see to know that came to life and she realized I'm not a Samaritan who's who's an outcast of my village that's not my identity my dinner is I'm a child of God I trust you've heard the voice behind the voice amen because if you heard their voice behind the voice God is wanting to get you to realize you're a son of mine your daughter of mine I purchase your salvation I mean when when when Mary are the thoughts in Matthew chapter 1 when Jesus's name is spoken by the angel says you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins hallelujah so if you've been delivered have you been delivered from your son nature I mean the name of Jesus been manifested in your life that's why I love that name hallelujah amen right now Abraham we are the children of Abraham by faith if you're a natural son of Abraham good for you well daughter that's nice but I like being a Gentile they have their promise but I'm gonna be honor I'm gonna be at a wedding supper when they receive the same God I know right they're all on the economy of God but I'm glad I'm I'm glad I fall in this lot you know I'm glad I'm like Rahab I'm glad I'm like the woman at the well I'm glad I'm like the leper right I'm glad I'm like those kind of people I'm glad I'm like Peter I'm glad I'm like even Paul religious up to us beyond his eyebrows thank God came and spoke to him a man and transformed his life I'm glad I'm like most kind of people hallelujah there's nothing wrong with rejoicing as they it's not gonna hurt anyone I never seen someone get hurt with people are rejoicing they won't hurt you too much okay no I don't think it will at all no Romans 4 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead and when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that he that had promised was able also to perform you have to have you judged him have you actually become fully persuaded that he is able this is what God you know the big challenges do you believe his word completely I mean Abraham he only had one promise really you're gonna have a promise son he's fully persuaded but then when you go wait they just keep reading this but you go read about Abraham's life and it may appear to be a different story but this is now a God riding through the Apostle Paul after the cross anyway Romans 4 22 and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but also for but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead who was delivered for our offense and was raised up again for our justification abraham staggered a few times it appears he back slid went you know left the land a couple of times told both kings in those lands that Sarah was his sister and he she was the half-sister but you know we're not married you're beautiful they'll kill me to take you say we just brother and sister he did all these kind of things any and and it's even in the scripture where he where God comes John says you're gonna be the father of Nations and he laughs at the feet of God right you read about in the scripture but yet all that human fail you know no failure when when so Moses was writing that account under the blood of bulls and goats so all those failures were still recorded but then now when Paul was writing about Abraham's life after the cross god only sees the good right and he was fully persuaded his his final obituary is that he was strong he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong I mean he's taken all the problems of God unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that that what he had promised he was also able to perform amen he says put it back and therefore see and he considered not his own body now did he didn't even bring into account his physical being Amen this is this is faith again at the end time but brother Graham says this here's interesting he says and Jehovah Jireh 64 and we'll close with this he says but in this covenant I have already made you a father of many nations I he and he's already it's all unconditional the Covenant is purely Grace just absolutely grace only thing they had to do to maintain this covenant will stay and abide in the land and every blessing went with the Covenant was with them the only thing they had to do was stay in that land now we find out when they went down to Egypt they lost their blessing but not their covenant the Covenant was still the Covenant was still there they lost the blessing but not their covenant because the Covenant was Grace unconditionally that's the same thing our land is the Word of God right you may people may leave the land but the Covenant is still there they just let they just lose the blessing we don't want to lose the blessing right we want to stay in our in our land amen okay can we we have we have the musicians please just leave it there you know just as they come the syrophoenician woman at the beginning will cease from Canaan but in another part of scripture she's called a sorry Phoenician woman she was she was did earnest she'll get what she needs she didn't take it haphazardly right and we need to be the same kind of way we should be I believe we need to be more sincere and our approach to God and how we come to church and how we you know this is a house of prayer right we should spend time I believe seeking his face because you know I don't I don't believe we should just take it haphazardly walking with them so I'm trying to say our approach should be with sincerity and we should be did Ernest write and say Lord Here I am you know I don't I don't take it for granted that you've called me to be your bride that I'm the Bride of Christ I don't take that for granted I want to keep you amen I want to approach you reverently and with love and respect not just to Here I am did it and leaf you know what I mean but let's press in and get the promise amen let's stand shall we

together so it started where I needed to go back to South Africa and knowing that to get a ticket is expensive and I need to get there and for such a long time I didn't know should I go should I stay and the Lord showed me he showed me that I needed to go and I started the process and in that time my mum was still alive so I prayed I said lord I know you showing me I need to go it's a lot of money and I went to find out how much the tickets cost and everything and I'm well on my way there I prayed I said lord please my baby is special and my you provide in every need and I got the and the was is special and I got the price and I drove back and I said Lord you know that I can't exactly have booked the tickets now I don't have the money yet but and you know the tickets the price may vary so I'm asking for $2,000 then I know that whatever will happen I would have enough that was the Friday morning that Friday night I received a text saying if you want to come I can help from South Africa that was the first prayer answered the next week when I looked into the account it was exactly two thousand dollars on the dot I had the ticket was one thousand four ninety nine and then Daniel stick it with I even had enough to pay for his visa and everything even with my emergency certificate that I need to apply for that came through in one day Daniel's visa came through not as fast as I would have had but in the Lord's time going there everything went to plan everything wins according to the Lord plane and we celebrated mums life so many people came afterwards and said that was one of the nicest funeral because it wasn't a funeral it was an absolute celebration and I praise the Lord for that so the next morning that was the Monday after I arrived did you Tuesday morning so I during that weekend I said okay well I should get my passport sorted as soon as possible I don't apply for it and I'm so there you can always start the process you start the process online and then to make the process or quicker than to go and stand any queue you do it through the bank but they could have like the only the first appointment I got was a week in so I said okay that's pushing a bit for time so me and my brother decided we'll go and stand in the queue so we decided which way in which her face would be the best one and the quickest one so all that's coming from South Africa the quickest one believe it or not was right bang in the middle of Pretoria in the city that's not the best place to be at all so my brother said okay he'll go with me and driving there he said okay you should know we can understand in a queue for about eight hours see no we not we've prayed about this it's sorted you see no not a now but I said no no no you see he said I could well I took the day off to spend time with you as it's always been told me the queue that's right and um so we got the wish there stood in the first queue and he said okay now you just go and find out so that was outside not even inside the building you gon find out and I said okay no no we're in the wrong key the other one is inside okay so you go inside you stand in a queue you get a number and then when I call your number you go have your photo taken your finger prints and all of that and um so that was the first queue was half an hour the next one we said they probably around half an hour maybe a little bit more and got my finger way we know went to the fingerprints and everything she said but did you tell him at the front that keep applied online and he did everything online I said yes I did I could just wait and she went out and came back took the photo and when I got the new ticket for the next step priority was on the ticket and I basically just sat down and I called my number so in all in all it was probably an hour and a half and I looked at all the through the whole experience and I just looked at my brother and I every now no then I would say you see it's going quicker than you thought it's good we've prayed about this and when we got out and looked at him said you see this has been prayed through its sorted you'll see we hour and a half in we're good to go we've got time it's still breakfast we can go and have a breakfast so then the week went on and I was really because I still had to apply for my visa to get transferred and they said that would take at least in working dice to get that sorted as well so I knew I'm pressed for time and it's not just by not just the fact that you push your ticket Daniels visas also just so the seventh or that yeah the seventh of June so I had to move that as well if I move when I move my ticket and so I really prayed that in the second week because my dad's passport took about just over a week run about a week so I thought okay now then we're okay we'd be good mine one didn't it took longer so I only most of you know only received my passport on Tuesday so through everything the Lord has showed so much of himself and just with every day got passing and for even for my dad he'll come back and he said all the script he just read was all about faith and we should believe and I said well over got the same one was done pious soul be a David and the Lord's timing don't do it on your own this is hard this is not an easy trip it's hard and I'm sad to stay moaning I think it was around eleven how God that takes passport is ready now I need to go back and I need to go back and there long queue that was they was there pick up queue their collections one so I need to go back to go in standing that cute so we got there and that queue was outside the building going around so we went in and we talked to the the guy in front we explained the situation he said well I'm sorry I can't help you you need to go stand in the queue so at first I thought oh man we've explained everything could you just help and while we stood there my dad was with me while we stood there so that was 12:30 we got there and just a backtrack I found because I had to make an appointment for the visa and I couldn't get one so I found him and I explained the situation so they said okay just be there around 2:00 now I know okay 12:30 hi 2 o'clock it's the other side of Pretoria so we still need to get the we're pushing it's so me and my dad was standing there and he was praying and I was praying silently and we just talked and I watched the man standing at the door and everybody went that came they everybody tried their best to get it sneaked in and I just had compassion remember I started talking and said well that poor guys only doing his job if he leads everybody in with a different story I mean it's just the process and I'm Blighty he said no no but don't worry the key is actually going up it's not that long you'll see it at least at an hour and so finally we got in I think that was about quarter to two now half half past 1:00 we finally in the building now I need to stand in the next queue to get my number you can I get my number you go stand in the next cue to go clicked your passport I said half past 2:00 you we actually should leave now to be the boy 2 o'clock for the visa and so when I got the the guy that wrote my number they gave me my number I looked at him I said sir is there any way that you can help me I've got a two o'clock appointment for my visa it's the other side is there any way you can help me he gave me my number he said just give me a minute go and stay and he said okay I looked at my number number 680 yeah all right here we go I have no idea where they are in the line and in the queue but okay and I stood aside and he looked at me it was not even two minutes he looked at me he said what's your number I see 680 said okay come and he got up he got my passport he said okay just sign I'll tell them you've collected it that was I think tainted to two o'clock we out we're on our way and we got at the visa at 2:30 they're closing at 3:00 and he was no cute and he was nobody I went
