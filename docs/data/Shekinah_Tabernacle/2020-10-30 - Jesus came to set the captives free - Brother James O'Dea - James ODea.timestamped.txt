[0:03] i just want to say a little bit about
[0:05] the song before i sing it because i
[0:06] actually wrote the song about a year ago
[0:09] and i've never
[0:10] sung it before just so it's never worked
[0:12] out and i just believe that
[0:14] it was for this time and just going in
[0:17] line with what that has been preached
[0:18] and um
[0:19] the burden for the song come for the
[0:22] youth
[0:23] after hearing questions like well i
[0:25] don't really know if there is a god or i
[0:27] don't understand god
[0:28] and it's just a real burden that come
[0:30] upon my heart to write this song
[0:33] you know and jesus came to set the
[0:36] captives free and there can be
[0:38] small things in your life children you
[0:40] know what a captive is right
[0:42] a cat that's a prisoner and things can
[0:44] change you that are maybe just
[0:46] small things but jesus can set you free
[0:49] of that thing
[0:50] you know and god is real we see him in
[0:53] the resurrection you know we see the
[0:54] we see a seed goes down into the ground
[0:56] and it comes back again
[0:58] and you say well i don't know if god can
[0:59] heal me but you see a branch on a tree
[1:02] and the wind blows and that branch
[1:04] breaks and it's hanging down but it
[1:06] doesn't just die
[1:07] and fall off that branch heals itself
[1:10] and it and it grows with that sap around
[1:12] it and now that heel of that wound
[1:14] becomes
[1:14] stronger than it was before and you try
[1:17] to break that branch again it'll break
[1:18] somewhere else because you get stronger
[1:22] jesus came to set the captives free
[1:25] [Music]
[1:35] when it seems like everything's a
[1:38] mystery
[1:40] dark clowns build around you and your
[1:43] questioning
[1:44] remember god is revealed in simplicity
[1:49] just walk with him and you will see
[1:54] that jesus came to set the captives free

[2:09] and set this captive free

[2:16] victory
