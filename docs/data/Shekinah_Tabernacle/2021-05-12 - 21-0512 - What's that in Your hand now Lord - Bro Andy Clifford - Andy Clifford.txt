amen and you know creating an atmosphere so we can enjoy that and make you know preparation for the word to go forth and to have an atmosphere to preach and and to receive in and you know tonight you can have just a good time as me so i invite you to the to have a good time amen because i'm going to have a good time and i'm sure that you're going to have a good time alleluia you'll get what you expect hallelujah amen i want to speak tonight on a subject called what's that in your hand now lord what's that in your hand now lord amen and there's a question mark at the end of that because we want to know what is in the lord's hand can i please have a bible i just want a nice paper bible not someone else's because you need that but have you got a spare one now you can use that i just love to have it's like my you know i just love having a book because you know you can't hold this up as a demonstration for a bible because it's just an electronic device so i like that so amen let's turn in our bibles while we're standing to revelation chapter 10 and we'll read verses one and two oh my and then we're going to turn to exodus 4 and we'll read verses 1 to 4. it says here and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth and let's go to exodus 4 verses 1 to 4. and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me no now see god was now you know commissioning moses at the burning bush and moses was making up he didn't want to do it you know he was making up every reason not to do it so and god was now unfolding and undoing all of his reasons and so moses now he's now towards the end of this dialogue and and moses says and moses answered and said but behold they the israelites that he's sent to will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord has not appeared unto thee and the lord said unto him what is that in my hand and moses said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he shall cast it and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from it from before it and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hands god bless you you may be seated and may god bless the reading of his word the prophet says listen from that time but my ministry is a different ministry from a pastor or a teacher i'm i'm not he says and if i say things wrong brethren forgive me i don't mean it but this is my ministry see to declare him that he is here so you see there was something greater happening that i want to talk about tonight and i want this question for you to ask this question personally to the lord what is that in your hand now lord because you see there has always been a a war in the mind of man to understand and to see what god is doing now what god is presently doing because anyone can be a historian and see how it unfolded and see the results and see the fruit and then everyone just believes that because they saw it worked and everyone can read prophecy and go wow look at this this is what's going to happen and half the time they're not right because they are twisted in their own filters and things but it's that doesn't save you the history doesn't save you right you need to understand what who where he is what is jesus doing what is that in your hand lord what are you doing right now lord what is your program what is your purpose what is your plan for this age what are you doing in this generation i understand lord you've done great things throughout history right from adam all the way before adam that we know all the glorious things but lord what are you doing now because i want to know the person that did all that you understand it makes a big difference because anyone can be a historian but do they know him are they holding his hand as ed was saying are they hearing his heartbeat because you see he is the word and so if you're near him if you're in fellowship with him if you understand if you know what he's doing if you're in the program of god you are going to hear his heartbeat that's what hearing his heartbeat is all about you're coming into rhythm you know when you when the when the great composer he beats out the symphony you know and he writes the music and it's beautiful and it's got all the drama and all the suspense and the resolutions and everything in there you know the two two but there's if you're in the concert you know and and here's the start and hit this four parts to a concerto so where is it you know if you're playing in that thing if you're trained you you can't just come in where you where you want to come in you're going to come in where the beat is beating this makes a huge difference and so i want to talk tonight about this about understanding and coming into connection with the very rhythm and the beat of the heart of god amen to come and hold the hands of the one that died for me on calvary to hold his hand to know him to walk with him to walk with the one that went into the fiery furnace with all of those boys in babylon that's the one i want to hold his hand who wants to hold his hand tonight who wants to be in fellowship with the living god as men brother and paul we were having some fellowship one night and we were calling him the now god he's not the before or after god he's the now god and if you don't have the now about you haven't got any god right true you've got to be in fellowship with the now god and that's what calvary is all about that's what the redemption redemption's all about hallelujah but i want to take it now and make it very personal and bring a clarification on what happened in revelation chapter 10 and what the difference is what is he holding in his hand that he hasn't held in his hand before since adam lost the redemption in the garden because god's visited the earth many times many times as god visited the earth and done many things and come into the affairs of his children as sons as daughters and done great redemption acts and and great types have been unfolded and prophecies all throughout the ages throughout the church ages he's done great things many things laying a foundation telling a story doing great things and redeeming and saving and sealing as people but in the end time everything changes everything changes and it's all to do with what he's holding in his hand at the end time and it's the very paperwork spiritual paperwork that adam lost in the garden the very title deed if anyone's bought any land you will understand that you need to hold the title you need to hold the paperwork that says you own that land and and before you buy it you're going to get a lawyer to search it all the way back to make sure that there's no other things that are attached to it amen and then you buy the land right now there's a land that's been purchased by our loving lord jesus that no human could purchase no human could buy and he purchased that land and you are part of it you're part of that land hallelujah in all the ages the book of our inheritance you see he had an open book in his hand we read that right you caught that what is that now in your hand lord what have you got in your hand lord that you didn't have in any other church age or any other denomination or any other time any time what is that lord that you've got in your hand and where did you get that from lord where did it come from why wasn't it in your hand already and why did the other churches not have it who wants to understand that tonight who wants to see it so clearly so simply to resolve all the doubts and all the fears and all the you know the devil likes to mystify things you know and make it all but we want to just we want to see it and make it ours tonight it's mine it's yours but you see for all these ages and we'll read soon it said that man was not worthy to even look on it let alone open it and read it even look at it hallelujah but we have a champion oh we have a lamb amen we have a lamb that was worthy oh i feel like just going right into it already but we'll be very disciplined amen you know me everyone knows me very well i'm being very good right now oh lord jesus it was not real oh here sorry i'm just reading my own notes so excuse me this is not a scripture or quote or anything i'm just reading this just to keep the vision you know in the ages the book of our inheritance that adam lost was sealed in the hands of the original owner adam lost it that book said adam you own the earth you've got all power over everything over the fish over the trees you've got dominion you say it will happen you've you're god over the earth adam you're my son and i give you full dominion you do whatever you want adam you make this earth how you like it and adam lost it he lost it and he lost his connection to god he lost his connection to that divine fellowship you could say all of the glory of heaven left him he was disconnected but he had a memory he remembered it he must have told his sons and he would have understood great things and mysteries and but it was all just mysteries and great things and unfortunately sometimes that's all it is in our own life it's just mysteries and great things but what about the one that adam lost the connection that's been forged again that's been connected again and you can have that hallelujah amen it was not released until the correct season for it this is that redemption book now it was not released until the correct season for it because of the power that it contains you know this book contains everything and it basically gives you full legal right to everything that adam lost hallelujah oh my you know we're going to speak things into existence you know we're going to travel by thought you know we're just going to say to that mountain be moved you know you read these things in the gospels right and i've read them for years and i've gone wow you know this is amazing and you know it's and you think you go out there you know everyone's probably done it and go outside and you stay to the mountain now move and it doesn't move right why is it not moving lord everyone has those moments right especially the children my children they were becca told me the other day you know she said she always says to the sea oh no she walks up to the sea and she goes to walk on the water you know she wants to walk on the water i said you will one day you'll just walk on that water it'll just happen you know and and and we won't get too far into that today it will go beyond our scope but this is this is our reality these are the things that we're going to inherit and then and if you've got the holy ghost let me just drop this if you have the holy ghost now you've got that it's already in you hallelujah what's that you're holding in your hand now lord hallelujah because you see it's very important that you understand what he's coming with you know i'm sure that they understood what he's coming with every time he came because he bring it but the devil will try everything he can to block the elect in every age and every time god would move do a revival you know god would bring something god brings something to the table you know he brings grace he brings mercy he brings an element of grace or an escape you know in every age there's always something he's done and he's doing for the people to rescue them to change them to tell a story to reveal his glory to to to declare something to build an image to to do whatever he's doing there's always something he brings to the table however so it says here it was not released the book of redemption was not released until the correct season for it however the other ages received the same holy spirit so this is where now we can start to understand that they had the holy ghost god's come down in every church age done the same things the power of god the miracles if they could believe because he's still the same he doesn't change right jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever all right that doesn't mean that jesus christ gives the same message to every age it just means that he's the same he can choose what he gives he can choose how much grace he's dispensing to the people and he will program it and plan it so that the final age goes into rapture so that you and i who believes we're in the final age i don't even i believe we're just like beyond the final age you know we're just about to go we're nearly there so but he didn't he can't do that for the every other age because if they took that they would have gone into raps already and it would have broken the program so he did other things but it was the same god with the same holy spirit and the same anointing and the same everything and his personality as grace and all of those things but he wasn't holding an open book in his hand at that stage because it wasn't open you know we read in the book of daniel in daniel 9 it says daniel do you know daniel the prophet right he was a prophet that was breaking into the mysteries and breaking into what would happen in the end time and you know as a prophet and that gift he was just pushing you know fasting for weeks and god would honor that and he would begin to show but then it got to a point where he said daniel no more i can't do this yet because it's going to be sealed until the time of the end and at that time he described the conditions of the world he said many shall run to and fro airplanes all over the world and knowledge shall be increased knowledge increased in only last century for thousands of years they had horse and cart and swords i mean there was a little bit of a technological advancement but nothing like it was after the wars nothing ever like that it went from horse and cart in 1850 to an astronaut on the moon in 1960 how does that happen 69 or wherever it was 69 right was it 69 so there was like this cataclysmic change something happened something was released some anointing some wisdom of the tree of knowledge was just released on the earth and it just opened up all of the dimensions you know revelation 9 everyone knows revelation 9 how it said that um this that a a fallen star star would fall from heaven and have a key to the bottomless pit and open it up and black smoke would come out on the earth right and all the things that went on from there and the wars that said a third party man was killed which describes world war one and two right all of these things happened revelation 9 bringing out hell on the earth through all this technology and you know it's here now and hell's on the earth but heaven's also on the earth hallelujah and he's represented in you so the war of it's like a cold war you know it's a cold war and you'd seen you you're the meat in the sandwich your mind and god has come down and the devil has come up and it's just this great war that's going on and hardly anyone knows about it they think they're just living this life and really they're just living in blindness and sin and looking at the devil's facade and his visage and everything that he's showing people christians as well message believers too looking at this and not seeing through it but there is a veneer oh my and the lord has called us he says come to me my children and take of me i self so that you can see so tonight if you need i self just ask them young people you teenagers wherever you may be in your walk say lord give me yourself because i don't want to be blinded by the devil oh my all of us not just young people everyone hallelujah so i just want to emphasize that the same holy spirit but yet in this age that same holy spirit comes with a full message he comes with everything he comes with an open book you see in every other age it was closed and every other age it was sealed with seven seals in every other age you know he didn't see our lord came and he purchased that let's read and no man in heaven nor on earth revelation chapter 5 verses 3 to 7 it says and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not who's so glad that he said weep not amen behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof now listen listen to his what did he see and i beheld in low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders so in the middle of all the people representing all the ages all the elders all the the the people of all time that had ever come to to lead and with him it says here a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came oh my i like that i just want to emphasize he he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne this is the one that came and took the book right so all these other ages seven spirits seven eyes so the seven messengers to the seven church ages right they were given a message they were given a portion you know see they gave jo he gave paul the full portion except he didn't give him the open book because they would have gone in a rapture but he was sowing the seed in paul's age he was sowing the seed so that the seed could be given to the church and buried into the church in the dark ages but then come back up again as we know the cycle of death burial and resurrection it says that this is the same thing that happened in the church the same thing when the seed came into the church the lord brought it it went through the church and they rejoiced but they aimed at in that first church age under paul's message they aimed at this rapture this tree of life this and what adam lost they aimed at it but relaxed that's what this ate that age that first church age men so you see when the lord came to them he hadn't taken that book because there was still six more ages to go afterwards and so he came to the second age irenaeus and the third age and martin the fourth age and uh columba and martin luther in the fifth and john wesley in the seventh and william branham sorry six and william branham in the seventh but who's here now who's here now who got who got introduced the one that says the one that came the one that says and he came he's the one that's here now he was introduced right and i read that before the prophet says my ministry is not all this great teaching and all these things it's to declare him that he's here and then he says as john the baptist you know he says john the baptist had to pull back now he pulled back left the scene and left who here oh my who's here then and you can say what's that in your hand now lord what what are you carrying for me because you see in seven other ages there was power there was glory there was grace there was the supernatural whatever god was doing there was a provision for all of them in every age and every revival that god did but then it came to the time of the end where he himself our man our human oh my you see adam lost it adam the first adam he lost this inheritance and all through the last 6 000 years man didn't have it man didn't display what adam lost there was little portions of it moses had a portion he could speak and god gave him this anointing and and he was able to create things and all of that but and there was little portions revealed god was building something he was building a vision he was building the image of himself and he was revealing it in little portions of prophets and different men and women showing a story because our god is a storytelling god he's and you can read every story in the old testament and find yourself in there and if you can't i encourage you to read it again if you can't see jesus christ and yourself and every story of scripture somewhere then go read it again because he will show you and he's done that and you see now so he's done this through every age and he's built this image and he's building something hallelujah but in all these ages and all these visitations and everything that he's done through all these people man could not display what adam lost but then two thousand years ago hallelujah god rich in mercy amen who believes he's rich in mercy tonight god rich in mercy said you know the first adam failed the first adam left the first adam lost his inheritance and it's been back in the hands of the invisible god but there has to be a human because humans need it back hallelujah are you with me shoot the mankind the race of mankind needs this redemption back but how can an angel redeem it no can the trees redeem it can can can you know so what what happens what what could happen only one only god only god so god he made himself a body to live in a finite body a mortal body made a little lower than the angels it says and he made himself an egg and a sperm in the womb of a virgin hallelujah he sent her a gabriel the angel and he declared to her that you shall be the mother you you know in your womb is going to be born the child the christ and shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins you see now so here you have now the second race of man here you have now this race that was not connected by genealogy to the curse because you see all the sins and all the evils and everything that went on all the way back to adam was all full of curses and that's why when you're born you just struggle it's easy to lie it's easy to swear if you get caught in it it's easy to do evil things because the flesh is born with it but he wasn't you see he was our redeemer this was our man and he lived a perfect life and he lived right through his whole ministry and through his life he lived perfect and he displayed everything that adam lost he spoke to the trees and they obeyed him he spoke to the waves and they obeyed him when it was storm he could walk on the storm so don't think that when you're in a storm and when you're in a dark place and when it's too much that he can't walk on to see you he can come to you where you're at tonight he can come to you no matter how stormy i was showing my children a stormy sea and it's not you know the cartoons just show this and it's just on this little wave you know i was thinking now no no the bible says it was great tempestuous boisterous waves hundred foot waves but he can do hundred foot waves hallelujah because if you've got mastery of the elements your master not doesn't matter what how big how hard how small no matter what you're struggling with hallelujah he came walking on the water because he was our second adam he was our redeemer he's the one that had the purchasing power in his blood he's the one that could pay the price he was the one hallelujah that displayed everything that adam lost he had control of nature he kept controlled all these things and he did it because he was displaying everything that he was going to redeem back he was going to redeem it all back and so on calvary when he died hallelujah when he gave his life on calvary you know when and and he he bled and he purchased our redemption hanging there bleeding with the thorns around his brow and and completely utterly rejected by his own people completely dejected he purchased our salvation completely and utterly taking our sins upon himself to purchase our salvation to make the purchase but you see the purchase is part of the redemption to finish the purchase now let me read ephesians 1 9 to 14 it says here having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ so you see in the dispensation so when the fullness of times is dispensed he's going to gather all things to himself so everything that he purchased on calvary you know there's at least paul here is talking about a future event he's talking about somewhere in the future there's going to be a gathering there's going to be a unifying there's going to be a uniting time there's going to be a rapture there's going to be where he gathers and collects everything he purchased and let me tell you right now we're in the middle of that we're in the middle of him gathering everything that he purchased and this is what the devil will fight so that you don't understand it so when someone tells you that he's come to gather everything to himself then you know people the devil will tell people it's still in the future and if he's if you believe that then it will always be in the future for you but if you want it in the present for you if you want it now if you want to have that now believe it's yours believe what he's doing say lord open my eyes to see your work of redemption to see that you're gathering me to see that when you step forth as a bloody lamb and you took that book out of the hands of the original owner you were claiming back everything that adam lost you were bringing back the title deed of redemption and everything that he lost and you were possessing that back in human hands that's our human that's our god man that's our jesus this is what jesus did he came to purchase us back so when he took that book when he took that title deed he was taking ownership of everything that was his now in the process of that when that book had sat there for 6 000 years because remember this has only happened in the last 60 years right 60 years ago this happened you know we think the world just goes on right even the messages the people that believe this just will go on but is it significant to you are you moved by this or are you wanting to go to sleep who wants to go to sleep you know what does this mean to you this should be everything what i'm telling you now if you're not born again you can be born again by hearing this you can receive the new birth by hearing what you're hearing tonight you can humble your pride you can take your whole message religious spirit off you and receive the holy ghost and it will change your life tonight because the new birth is when jesus is revealed to you all right jesus comes in the form of a mighty angel with an open book right when we read revelation chapter 10 and you've got this mighty angel with the covenant about his head you know that that's the holy ghost right it's the holy spirit right the lord can appear in an angelic form it's the holy ghost it's that holy ghost right because in revelation 5 it was closed and it was in the hands of the original owner and in those 6 000 years that it was closed guess who squatted on the earth guessed who started destroying human lives guess who put idols in many civilizations well that title deed that said man you own everything you're over it all you're the god of the earth you're my son you're my daughter who when that was out of man's hands he couldn't get it back he wasn't even worthy to look at it who came in and pretended they owned it the devil why do you think your family's struggling right now why do you think there's all these things going on in your home why do you think your children just want to run away sometimes they struggle and it's all the mind battles it's because of a squatter it's because of someone who doesn't own what they're lying to you about lying he's lying he's a liar right now whatever you're going through he's a liar he's a liar he's a squatter and the reason he's there is because that book was in the hands of the original owner for six thousand years but let me declare something to you we have a champion we have a human a real human a real man our jesus he took it back and he didn't just keep it for himself he's come down to the earth to you tonight to say i want to live in you i want to open it to you and i want to make it personal to you so that when you stand you can have this in your hand who wants this in their hand this was the end of my sermon but i said what's in your hand now what's in your hand tonight what is it hallelujah if he's in you that's in you and if he's in you holding that then you can hold it too because he's in you right hallelujah come on church come on this is not an age to sit back and relax and enjoy your christianity oh my no no no no don't this is not a christian enjoyment time this is a fighting time hallelujah uniting time is fighting time you've got to stand for your rights you've got to stand for what's yours you've got to claim it back because he is a squatter the devil's a squatter who knows what a squatter is a squatter or somebody that comes into land that doesn't own it and there's it happens all over the world and there's even laws that protect them oh my that's just the devil right and the devil does that because adam lost it and if adam lost it he couldn't possess what he owned meant to own he lost it right he couldn't possess it so it was just in wasteland the earth was just in wasteland you could say one man at that time and one woman who was meant to rule the earth had dominion and everything be in perfect harmony oh my hallelujah everything just in perfection and everything just so glorious because the son of god was living in the earth and he was ruling over it but when he lost it he lost it he lost governance he lost the power of of attorney he lost everything apart from his physical life which he would lose eventually as the lord promised but while that happened an an invader came in an invader came in to invade to come and to destroy to come into squat thinking because he's not a gentleman he doesn't care whether he owns it or not he's just going to claim it my so how much more if the devil can get away with claiming things that he doesn't own how much more can you claim back what you actually own man how much more so tonight tonight you just say devil that's it i've heard the word i've heard i'm just saying devil no way absolutely no way are you holding back anything of mine anymore you're not holding my children you're not holding back my home you're not holding back anything whatever you're struggling with maybe you've got mental illness tonight at finish because he's a squatter you don't have to remain in those ways you don't have to remain defensive there's just no question because this that was back it's back in our possession do you realize that hallelujah then in the dispensation of the fullness of times that he might gather together in one all things in christ all those that were named in islam's book of life and in the book of life both first resurrection and second resurrection believers both sheep and ghosts not goats sorry both sheep and the first resurrection that takes part in the marriage supper the first fruits of his oh you know the foolish virgin and the wise virgin all of them from israel all the way through to the bride all the way through everyone when he took that book when batman oh my you know i can't describe it oh man lord may he reveal this to you to make it so real the prophet said this was the most sublime act in scripture because everything that he purchased everything that he died for all the stripes all the disgusting horrible things they did to him everything that he suffered and the most horrible painful death that could ever be died he did it even the earth had to testify by going dark and shake he did it for you and he did it so that we could be redeemed he did it let me just i just have to go back to this before i go any further sorry for stopping but i just have to if i go too far we'll we'll just go too far too soon so it says here in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in jesus in christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until can everyone say until until the redemption of the purchased possession let me repeat that again so you catch it the holy spirit a promise that you were sealed by and the all the seven ages were sealed by in the church ages and they were sealed by the holy ghost they really had an experience with the holy spirit they were sealed and they will rise again and we'll be raptured with them but they did and physically they're actually in glory under the altar with the lord sealed under their messenger that they had in their age whoever god was using in their revival in their time right they were sealed with them and their pastors and their groups and whoever god was ministering through the ministry in those times the people were gathered with their people sealed by the real holy ghost no different than what you have now right now that may sound funny but just remember it's the same person he's always been the same he's always been the same person right but he just comes with a different type of message or a different part of his grace a different expression of his personality but in the end time he would come with an open book what for to gather everything that he had sealed including the ones that are alive and remaining hello alive and remaining you are the alive and remaining you're going to you're getting it now it's coming to you now right something more than any other age and it just sounds so simple and you can can you put your finger on it well i guess you can if you're a good teacher maybe you can teach all of the things that he taught that was different but really to me when i look at it i say he came with my inheritance and he came not just with it but he said this is what it is now it's time that i'm going to make you worthy to look at it because he was worthy he was the man that said i'm the i'm bringing it back you know it was in the hands of the father and the devil squatted for all these years and caused destruction on the earth and broken everything down and caused religious people but then finally one day hallelujah he would come and he would purchase it and then at the end and the fullness of times which we've just read in the fullness of times he would come and redeem his purchase possession do you know what that means it says here which is so the holy spirit it says you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance right so the holy spirit is like the down payment of your inheritance it's the thing that he gives you so that you're sealed until the day of your redemption so that you can do the works of christ so that he can be the christian in you so he can change your operating system so that you can live right and then when you die if you die before the rapture he will you'll raise again because that resurrection's in you right but there will come a time when there's a living people and it says here but that earnest of our inheritance that down payment of our inheritance the holy ghost which were sealed by him were in all the other ages until the redemption of the purchase possession so that we are the purchase possession they were the purchase possession but there has to come a time where that's redeemed there has to come a time where all of that that was paid for all of it that's represented in that book that was sealed it was represented there and it couldn't it wasn't back in man's hands but then one day he would have to it says redeem the purchase possession so he would take what he had paid for and take what all calvary's meaning and everything that he died for and he would take it and as our man jesus was a man who believes me that god became a man and that as a man he paid everything and as a man he's taking it all to himself and we are in the process hello i know you've heard all this before but i just want to reiterate it you know you've got to just obey the lord i just have to do it so someone here is going to get blessed he redeemed it back he's taken it back so that we can be redeemed to him and as living people because everyone puts us off into some future thing when he comes in the third coming well you know when he comes to the earth he's going to redeem it all but it's happening now hallelujah the inheritance that adam lost and satan squats over the title deed the deed of ownership purchased at calvary must be taken back into human hands and handed back to the human race the redemption of the purchased possession you are his purchased possession but you need to be united together in a rapture and so that's why the prophet preached uniting time and sign says here only a man could oh only a man could do it because a man lost it god in human form shown as it had been slain shows the purchase that shows he purchased this back that's why when you read in revelation chapter 5 when you see when john saw who was actually going to get it he it's represented as a lamb that had been slain as a lamb that was covered in blood to show that the one that died on calvary the one that did it the one that sent seven spirits to the seven church ages and seven eyes of prophetic insight to the messengers that that for the last two thousand years that's the one that stepped forth to take the book and revelation 5 is identifying that this is the one that would step forth this is our man that would say this is the time in 1963 as you know this was the time when this would transpire hello yes this is a date if anyone doesn't know 1963 is the time where it finally could happen where all the ages had run out where it would come to the time of the fullness of time where it would be the season for change the season for a new dispensation the season of the son of man to come on the scene to take back and begin the process of the rapture we're being ushered into the millennium it's not just in a flash you're gone it's in process you know loading it's loading it's loading it it's loading in me it's loading in you things are happening right god's taking you hallelujah just like he took israel how's our time going god took israel you know and israel types the church but he took israel from out of egypt out of the world and he drowned their enemies in the red sea but they still had enemies inside them right there was still a work to do there was redeeming to do in their lives they he took them out of egypt but you've got to take egypt out of them he took you out of the world but he's going to take the world out of you but then once finally it comes a time when you cross over the jordan river right israel went through the wilderness they had their times of doubts and unbelies but one time they crossed over the jordan and when they crossed over the jordan they met a captain hallelujah and when they met that captain they because they didn't know how they're going to take jericho the devil had been preparing that place for 400 years he had heard what god said to abraham and so he got real prepared you know the devil hears what god's going to do in your life and he begins to prepare to stop you but nothing can stop you if you listen to the captain when the captain speaks you say yes and if it sounds silly you just do it anyway if you don't feel like you want to do it just do it because he said it you know joshua he went up to that captain and you know what he saw in the captain he saw a sword in the captain's hands hallelujah hallelujah you know the captain's come down in our generation i'm just talking about them all the whole service this is the same one you know hallelujah that captain that came down to israel to show them how to defeat jericho defeat ai defeat all their enemies and rescue rahab out of prostitution or whatever she's going through all of that condemnation everything she she was rescued why because the captain revealed to them what to do hallelujah he came down with a sword but in this generation in 1963 you know people get scared when you put a date on something don't be scared and when the angel comes he always just says fear not so if you're fearing right now just don't fear because if you fear or your faith we don't want faith to be crippled right now we want you to believe believe that this happened right and you remember great things happened in simple things simple ways how many people knew that the angel of the lord came down you know to different places in different times to create great things and change of israel and you know when gabriel came to mary do you think the whole nation saw it no do you think they believed it even when she said it no it just happens like that so great things great dispensational changes happen in the world just goes on by religious world church world catholic world whatever world it may be they don't see it but there is a people that do see it god is determined that his elect will see it and his people will come alive so tonight just believe tonight and you see that same mighty angel that came down to israel to to reveal how to conquer the land you know when they came out of the wilderness they came out of the nomination they came out of this old way this old egyptian way and they came across the jordan led by the word led by the ark you know on the ministry's head you know on their shoulders they went through and they came over and there was the captain and he said do this and tonight if the angel of the lord speaks to you or tells you do this you do it hallelujah so the captain came down and he had an oh he had a sword in his hand but our captain our jesus the one that took the book out of the hands of the father the one that took the book out of the original owner's hands the one that's made it real to us the one that says you can have it back that one comes down into these services comes down into your family altar comes down in our generation what with the same sword what does he reveal you've got a journey when you get the holy ghost and you come out of you come out of the wilderness you come out of egypt you come through and you get the holy ghost god is going to reveal to you just how to conquer those enemies and has been preached on sunday little by little not everything all at once just a little step at a time amen hallelujah i'm just going to read this now oh my now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty god the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when adam forfeited it then satan's dirty hands could not take it see satan didn't have legal rights to it so it went back to its original owner god himself we're going to find it just in a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed oh that makes me feel religious the title deed to eternal life the abstract title deed to eternal life we're about to introduce one more thing and then i'll close and that's the abstract may god help me i'm trying to teach me you know it just keeps coming out different when adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner almighty god what a great thing all right waiting what's it doing in the hands of god waiting for redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the redeemer is to take it back that's our jesus you see where we're getting to now we'll watch this fellow sitting upon the throne all right waiting for redemption claims it's redemption this title deed to come back into the possession of human beings right waiting because once that happens there's a different authority there's a different power that gets released right upon the people because now that adamic covenant that was before the fall gets reenacted into the people but they have to believe what they have and tonight the purpose of this is so that you can believe what you actually have so that you can see what you have because he was worthy to look upon it and open it so that you could come under his message come under his covenant come under his grace you know the the great headship himself the great loving lord jesus to come down in the end time to reveal the contents of this to show you who you are to show you what's yours no man if you don't know what's yours how are you going to claim it until he shows you what's yours but not to show you in your mind but by revelation if you just open your channel of joy right now it'll become it can be revealed to you if you're sitting there with your mind open all you're going to get is a whole bunch of knowledge and it won't help you but it just won't help you so i encourage you right now just open just open your joy channel and say lord i honestly i just want to draw waters from the wells of salvation this morning this evening because i want this to become so real to me to you and this is the burden i believe that these things will be made plain what is the book of redemption oh sorry all right waiting what's it doing in the hands of god waiting for redemption's claims sorry i've read that what is this book of redemption this title deed abstract title deed you say abstract what does an abstract mean means it searched all the way back to its beginning like that that little drop of ink this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sin had been confessed and fallen into the blood of jesus christ oh my it gives an abstract write straight back to the creator again you become a son of god abstract title deed is held in the hands of the almighty oh my this has come back into our position to reveal to expose the enemy to expose all his devices to expose how he's operated all throughout time but that's just one side it's also come to reveal the nature and heart of god to reveal the symphony of god to reveal the program of god to understand where he's at what he's doing what where is the rhythm beating out where is it at what's happening in this very hour what's happening in your life are you connected to it right because see it's come back out of the hands of the original owner and into jesus hands but in 1963 when the seals came open he handed this book back when a prophet was standing there on mount sunset and he was standing there and praying and then all of a sudden a sword landed in his hand and and the lord said to him this is the king's sword and he began to switch the sword around you know i think you just got to start switching the sword around i think you've just got to start taking this that's yours taking what knowing remember he's revealing to you what's yours revealing to you what belongs to you but do you think the devil's just going to give it back if you know you're going to go claim it you're going to get down and pray for it amen and then go forth because once you get serious with god once you really start laying it out oh my the devil starts to shake he begins to have to let it go because there's an enforcer behind your prayer there's a holy spirit to come and enforce the restoration because it's yours and then you read a little bit more because it's open to you because the spirit of god comes down into you to reveal to you what is yours but you've got to search it you've got to begin to expect it you've got to come to church and pull on the ministry you've got to come and you've got to say lord i'm getting serious with you now lord if there's any besetting sins in my life i'm going to get rid of them now because it's not worth it anymore it's not worth it to do those things anymore it's not worth it to speed it's not worth it to do all of these things that aggravate the holy ghost it's not worth it to swear it's not worth it to drink it's not worth it to do anything that's going to aggravate the holy spirit right it's not worth it but we struggle with it you know these things happen you see your conscience and it begins to become a problem and all of a sudden you're like well what happened and you're in something and it's very difficult to get out once your conscience is said whatever it may be right and we've all got weaknesses the devil knows them and he'll try and use leverage but tonight hallelujah and forevermore realize what you have realize who you have realize who you are realize what he's made you hallelujah realize that there's a power inside you to claim it all back hallelujah you know when they did the abstract search you know they they when he came down and and opened the seals in 63 you know what was god doing he was searching back to the to adam searching back everything and showing you what all of it's been cleaned off you know he preached about the bleach you know how the blood would bleach and and and the sin of the true believer he magnified grace magnified justification so you're not just forgiven the blood doesn't just forgive you it completely justifies you justify do you know what that means you go to court and you you and they'd find that you you're innocent you didn't do it you didn't do it that's what the blood does it's bleach it takes your sin it takes all the unbelief it takes everything and you just drop it into the bleach of this blood of this word of our jesus the one hold his hand he did it back in calvary all right yeah he did it but who you've got to meet him that did it hallelujah just like most of christendom just claim that they've forgiven and claimed the blood but do they know him do they know the one that did that do they do they understand the very program of the one that hung on the cross this is where it's at because he is the dispensation he is dispensing mercy he is doing something right now hallelujah and let me tell you what he's doing revelation 10 tells you what he's doing and what he's done and what what's happening he's come down with an inheritance and everybody in this room is listening to this there's an inheritance for you right here it's all open there's nothing held back anymore nothing this is right here for you you and you can read it now the devil doesn't like this he hates it because he's being exposed and his power is being stripped because he you realize that every little thing that's in your life that's against god or is aggravating to the holy spirit is a squatter not part of you it's not your family personality you know like yes it may be come from that but it's not actually yours because we had an abstract title search and if you want to know what the abstract title searches you just read the gospels read the gospels and you'll see what the abstract title searches that's what it is that's his life right you look at his life and god searched back and that's what he sees he sees this perfect life a son of god and he sees a man coming to his inheritance he sees him speak and it happens and what does he see he's got a vision in front of him and he's like the great you know masterpiece like michelangelo with a statue of moses and he's god's got this image in his mind of who you are and he's beginning to he's forming it and forming it and forming it and he's telling you now it's time to stand now it's time to just to just just just completely call the devil's bluff now it's time for you to get into what has been given to you and express it because it's been searched back everything your life has been searched back everything nothing held back all for you it's time to completely remove lucifer from the squatters perch an abstract search has been made back to the original thought of the true image of male and female and everything an abstract search has been searched back to what a real man is to what a real woman is to what real justification is to what real sanctification is what is holiness what is the personality of god what was hidden in the back part of god's mind and abstract search was searched all the way back so that you could be clear so that you could lay your stake in the ground and say that's it this is mine i'm not going to settle for anything less but i'm going to walk on amen can we have the musicians please sunset mountain was one of the turning points for mankind did you know that sunset mountain because in that place a significant event took place and we know what took place how a prophet was standing there a man who was born in sin shapen an iniquity a man who had tried to kill people in his adolescence and all sorts of things just like you and i born in sin redeemed by the blood but a sword landed in his hands to declare that the portion of grace that was given to man when jesus took the book and it claimed it back into the possession of human beings would be could be given to a man that was redeemed to but not just to have it for in one man but in the people that believe this message and the people that would walk with the same god that was introduced with an open book would come to the same inheritance would come to the same redemption would come to the same grace would come to the same place with the same things happening in their lives so that you yourself can speak and it will happen this is all a purpose and the purpose of this is for you to understand that in every age the holy ghost has been poured out and all the times it's been the same holy spirit but in this time when he comes to the people he comes with an open book he comes to what everything to give back everything that adam lost and let me finish with this one thought what did adam lose what did adam lose and this is this is the key to the whole thing adam lost access to the tree of life the cherubims the four cherubims the man ox line and eagle turn their swords against adam and the human race and said you can't come back into this dimension you can't come back into this yet there's no way made for you you are kicked out of it you cannot come back adam because if you touch this and eat this you will live forever so what is it that's come down in this end time and the dispensation of the fullness of times open what is it that the holy ghost is holding what is in your hand lord now what is in your hand now lord what's what's that last piece of the puzzle that you're holding lord that if i take this i'm going to what live forever so it's a rapturing key it's the key to living forever that's why we everything that adam lost was in that so what is that if you look at it it's access to the tree of life again because there's a people at the end time that must live forever so they've got to eat something that makes them live for ever what is it it's the fullness of christ the fullness of the holy ghost restored back into the church but it's not just like you know we say yeah the fullness of the holy ghost it's so good but what does that mean what that means is this open book this inheritance comes down into your soul because when the holy ghost comes down he comes down the mighty angel and he puts his feet on the land and sea of your life he puts his feet his brazen feet right on the land and see what are the land and see is your spirit and your flesh those two things that trouble you but he comes down to give you dominion over them and what is he holding your inheritance and where is your inheritance it is in you open and it's declaring who you really are to the world and the contents in there you become a beneficiary of the contents so do you realize now how privileged you really are and this wasn't in any other age because if it was and they were eating so what are you eating let's play that song he uh i went to the enemies camp you know [Applause] we're gonna sing the song i went to the enemies camp and i took back what he stole from me but i really want you to do that just think of something he's stolen from you and take it back tonight because he spotted too long i just want to declare that the devil squatted too long don't settle anymore don't don't let him anymore today this is this is his expiry date all right amen hallelujah amen you can say devil i've got an open book in my life and it's declaring that you're a squatter and you have no right and i'm being purchased
